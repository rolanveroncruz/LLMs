Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Mr. Charles Marvin Romig* (G.R. No. 262092, October 09, 2024)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assailing the CTA *En Banc*'s decision, which affirmed the CTA Second Division's ruling in favor of the Estate of Charles Marvin Romig (Estate), represented by Maricel Narciso Romig. The core issue is whether the Estate is entitled to a refund of erroneously paid estate tax on a US Dollar savings account (FCDU) held by the deceased, Mr. Romig, with HSBC.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Two-Year Period Compliance:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CTA's ruling that the Estate *did* comply with the two-year prescriptive period under Sections 204 and 229 of the 1997 NIRC for filing both administrative and judicial claims for refund. The CIR's argument that filing both claims on the same day (albeit with a short interval) shortly before the deadline constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies was rejected. The SC cited *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Carrier Air Conditioning Philippines, Inc.*, emphasizing that the law only requires both claims to be filed within the two-year period, regardless of the time between filings.
*   **Tax Exemption of FCDU Deposits:** The SC held that the FCDU deposit is *exempt* from estate tax based on Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6426 (Foreign Currency Deposit Act), as amended. The Court emphasized that RA 6426 is a *special law* specifically dealing with foreign currency deposits and that it was not expressly repealed or modified by the 1997 NIRC, a *general law* on national internal revenue taxes. The SC applied the principle that a special law prevails over a general law unless the general law expressly repeals the special law.
*   **Estate Tax Refund:** Because the FCDU deposit was exempt, the SC upheld the lower courts' decision ordering the CIR to refund the Estate the amount of PHP 4,565,349.07, representing the erroneously paid estate tax, including interest and penalties.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6426** (Foreign Currency Deposit Act), as amended by Presidential Decree Nos. 1034, 1035, and 1246, Section 6 (Tax Exemption).
*   **1997 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)**, Sections 84, 85, 86(A), 87, 204, 229, and 291.

**Case Law:**

*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Carrier Air Conditioning Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 226592, July 27, 2021) - Addressed the issue of simultaneity of administrative and judicial claims.
*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bases Convention and Development Authority*, 868 Phil. 567, 581 (2020) - Reiterated the statutory construction principle that a special law prevails over a general law.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The CIR consistently argued a lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies, which highlights the tension between filing claims close to the deadline and allowing the BIR sufficient time to act. While the SC sided with the taxpayer in this case, this issue remains a potential point of contention in similar cases.
*   **Implied Repeal:** The CIR's unsuccessful argument regarding the implied repeal of RA 6426 by the 1997 NIRC underscores the ongoing debate about the scope of repealing clauses in general tax legislation and the need for explicit language when repealing special tax exemptions.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **CIR's Obligation:** The CIR is obligated to refund or issue a Tax Credit Certificate to the Estate for the erroneously paid estate tax of PHP 4,565,349.07.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The general repealing clause in Section 291 of the 1997 NIRC was deemed insufficient to override the specific tax exemption granted by RA 6426.
