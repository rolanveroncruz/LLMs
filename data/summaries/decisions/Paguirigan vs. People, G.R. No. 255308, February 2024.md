## Legal Document Summary: *Ma. Anacleta Rachelle Paguirigan y Cueto vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 255308)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding conviction for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision and *acquitting* the petitioner, Ma. Anacleta Paguirigan. While acquitted, the petitioner remains *civilly liable* for PHP 780,000.00.

**Facts:**

*   Paguirigan (Anacleta) entered into two contracts to sell with Elizabeth Delos Tri√±os (Elizabeth) for properties in Quezon City. The first contract was for a property owned by Alfredo A. Rosanna, which Anacleta represented as the vendor. The second contract was for a different property.
*   Elizabeth paid Anacleta initial payments for both properties, totaling PHP 880,000.00. The sales fell through; first because the owner of the property from the first contract sold it to someone else, and second because Elizabeth's loan application was denied.
*   Elizabeth demanded a refund, and Anacleta issued checks that bounced.
*   Anacleta was charged with two counts of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), of the RPC.

**Procedural History:**

*   **RTC:** Convicted Anacleta for Estafa in the first contract, acquitted in the second, but held her *civilly liable* for PHP 780,000.00 for both contracts.
*   **CA:** Affirmed Anacleta's conviction for Estafa in the first contract.
*   **Supreme Court:** Reversed the conviction, acquitting Anacleta, but upheld her *civil liability* for PHP 780,000.00.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a), RPC:** Requires false pretenses regarding power, influence, qualifications, property, etc., executed prior to or simultaneously with the fraud, reliance by the offended party, and resulting damage.
*   **Sufficiency of Information:**  The Supreme Court held that the Information was *deficient*. The Information alleged misrepresentation as a "licensed developer engaged in real estate business," but the conviction was based on "falsely pretending to own the property." This variance between the charge and the proof prejudiced Anacleta's right to be informed of the accusation against her.  The prosecution attempted to convict her for acts not stated in the Information, violating her Constitutional Rights.
*   **Variance Doctrine (Rule 120, Sections 4 & 5, Rules of Court):**  The Supreme Court rejected the CA's application of the variance doctrine. This doctrine allows conviction for an offense "necessarily included in the crime charged," but the Court found the offenses to be related but distinct. The lack of proof in the Information did not establish this essential point.
*   **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** The Court found the prosecution failed to prove the elements of Estafa, particularly the element of *deceit*. The Court noted that the contract identified Alfredo as the owner and Anacleta as his representative, negating the claim she falsely pretended to be the owner. Furthermore, her willingness to refund and acceptance of payments under the second contract suggested good faith.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Despite acquittal, the Court upheld Anacleta's *civil liability* for PHP 780,000.00 due to her *judicial admission* of the debt.  This is consistent with established jurisprudence that an acquittal on reasonable doubt does not preclude civil liability based on preponderance of evidence. The debt bears interest at 6% per annum from finality of judgment.

**Potential Risks & Considerations:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Engagement in Legitimate Real Estate and Construction Business":** The Information's wording could be considered too broad and vague.  The facts alleged in the Information were insufficient to fully inform the defendant of the specific acts that constituted the alleged fraud.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** The Court's reliance on Anacleta's "good faith" suggests a fact-intensive inquiry that could be challenged based on further evidence (had the information been accurate).
*   **Enforcement of Civil Liability:**  Elizabeth may face challenges in recovering the PHP 780,000.00 plus interest, depending on Anacleta's assets and willingness to pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315, paragraph 2(a), Revised Penal Code:** Estafa through false pretenses.
*   **Rule 110, Sections 6, 8, & 9, Rules of Court:** Sufficiency of Information.
*   **Rule 120, Sections 4 & 5, Rules of Court:** Variance Doctrine.
*   **Homol v. People, G.R. No. 191039, August 22, 2022**
*   **Pielago v. People, 706 Phil. 460, 469 (2013)**
*   **Quimvel v. People, 808 Phil. 889, 913 (2017)**

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of specificity in criminal Informations and underscores the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the exact nature of the charges against them.  The Supreme Court prioritized protecting this right over a technical application of procedural rules. The finding of civil liability despite acquittal rests squarely on the defendant's judicial admission.
