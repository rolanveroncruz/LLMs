## Legal Document Summary: *Eulogio v. Apeles*, G.R. No. 167884 (2009)

This case involves a *Complaint for Specific Performance with Damages* filed by Petitioner Enrico Eulogio (Eulogio) against Respondents Spouses Clemente and Luz Apeles (Apeles) to compel the execution of a Deed of Absolute Sale based on a *Contract of Lease with Option to Purchase*. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and dismissed Eulogio's complaint.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Contract of Lease with Option to Purchase:** Purportedly executed on 6 January 1987, granting Eulogio the option to purchase the leased property within three years for a price not exceeding P1.5 million, with rent payments credited to the purchase price. Clause 5 dictates the execution of a Deed of Sale by the Apeles upon Eulogio's exercise of the option and payment of the agreed-upon consideration.
*   **Option Clause:**  Gave Eulogio the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the property.
*   **Rental Arrears:**  Apeles demanded payment of rental arrears from January 1991 to December 1996 and sought eviction.

**Obligations:**

*   **Eulogio (Alleged Optionee):**  Obligated to provide a separate and distinct consideration for the option contract for it to be valid and enforceable; to provide credible and consistent testimony to support the validity and execution of the contract.
*   **Apeles (Alleged Optionor):**  If the option contract was valid (which it was not found to be), they would be obligated to sell the property at the agreed price upon proper exercise of the option.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Eulogio:**  His complaint was dismissed. He was unable to enforce the purported option contract. The potential risk was the loss of the property and the cost of litigation.
*   **Apeles:**  Initially, the RTC ordered specific performance and damages. The risk was the forced sale of their property below market value, plus the cost of defending the action.  Ultimately, they were successful in defending against the claim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1479, Civil Code:** Governs option contracts, requiring a separate and distinct consideration for the option.
*   ***Southwestern Sugar and Molasses Company v. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co.***, 97 Phil. 241 (1955): Established the principle that an option contract, to be valid, must be supported by a consideration distinct from the price.
*   ***Bible Baptist Church v. Court of Appeals***, G.R. No. 126454 (2004): Reaffirms the requirement of separate consideration for option contracts, specifying it may be non-monetary but must have value and be clearly specified.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 41:** Grants the Court of Appeals the power to review the findings of fact made by the trial court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Issues:**

*   **Validity of Contract:** The main issue was the genuineness of Luz Apeles' signature and the validity of the entire contract due to alleged forgery.
*   **Consideration for Option:**  Lack of separate and distinct consideration for the option to purchase rendered the option clause unenforceable, even if the contract were otherwise valid.
*   **Inconsistent Testimony:** Eulogio's shifting testimony regarding the date and circumstances of the contract's signing fatally undermined his credibility and the weight of evidence in his favor. This case highlighted the importance of the testimony to the finding of fact by the RTC. The CA successfully argued that the RTC should not have relied on testimony due to blatant contradictions that destroy the testimony of the witness

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The case reinforces the requirement for a separate and distinct consideration for a valid and enforceable option contract under Article 1479 of the Civil Code. The consideration cannot be the purchase price itself.
*   Inconsistencies and lack of credibility of the plaintiff's testimony can be fatal to their case, especially in civil disputes requiring preponderance of evidence.
*   Notarization, while creating a presumption of regularity, can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, especially when the parties are not present before the notary public.
*   Appellate courts are not bound by the factual findings of trial courts when those findings are not based on witness credibility or when the evidence is documentary and subject to independent review.
