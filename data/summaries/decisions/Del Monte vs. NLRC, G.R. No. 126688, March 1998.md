## Legal Document Summary: *Del Monte Philippines, Inc. vs. NLRC and Alsola* (G.R. No. 126688)

**Case Overview:** This is a special civil action for certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision that Del Monte Philippines, Inc. (Del Monte) illegally dismissed Procesa Alsola. The NLRC ordered Del Monte to pay Alsola backwages and separation pay.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Absence Without Permission (AWOP) Policy:** Del Monte's company rules require employees to file and have approved leave applications before being absent. Unapproved absences are considered AWOP, subject to graduated penalties, culminating in dismissal for the sixth offense.
*   **Medical Certificates:** Del Monte asserts that Alsola submitted medical certificates from non-accredited doctors to justify her absences, which they deemed insufficient.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** The NLRC found that Del Monte failed to prove the exact days of Alsola's AWOP, only considering two show-cause letters actually received by Alsola. The NLRC deemed the absences covered by these letters justified by medical certificates.
*   **No Prior Disciplinary Action:** Alsola had a clean record in her 22 years of service before dismissal. She was not given a prior warning/reprimand for her AWOP.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:** Del Monte bears the burden of proving just cause for Alsola's dismissal ( *Raycor Aircontrol Systems vs. NLRC, Uy vs. NLRC*).
*   **Due Process:** Del Monte is obligated to provide Alsola due process, which includes providing Show-Cause letters.
*   **Compliance with Company Rules:** Del Monte must consistently apply its AWOP policy and related penalties.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The NLRC found Alsola was illegally dismissed.
*   **Monetary Awards:** Del Monte is liable for backwages and separation pay.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of AWOP:** The ambiguity lies in proving the number of AWOPs. Del Monte's failure to properly document and prove service of all show-cause letters weakens its case.
*   **Medical Certificate Acceptance:** Del Monte's inconsistent acceptance of Alsola's medical certificates presents a risk. Its sudden requirement for company-accredited doctors is deemed unfair and potentially discriminatory in light of her years of service.
*   **Abandonment Claim:** Del Monte's abandonment claim is weak as it failed to prove a clear and deliberate intent by Alsola to abandon her job. The filing of the illegal dismissal case by Alsola negates abandonment (*Canete vs. NLRC*).
*   **Retrenchment Context:** The decision mentions a retrenchment program. A potential risk involves the dismissal of Alsola may have been to reduce the workforce, which is prohibited under law.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Security of Tenure:** Del Monte's actions are evaluated against the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure (*Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation vs. NLRC*).

**Case Law:**

*   **Five J Taxi v. NLRC, Loadstar Shipping Co., Inc. v. Gallo:** Findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC are respected if supported by substantial evidence.
*   **Caliguia vs. NLRC:** Separation pay and backwages are appropriate remedies in lieu of reinstatement when reinstatement is not feasible.
*   **Jackson Building Condominium Corporation vs. NLRC, Reno Foods, Inc. vs. NLRC:** Defines and establishes the elements of abandonment as a valid ground for termination.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The vagueness of the company's policies, particularly with respect to acceptance/rejection of medical certificates.

**Conclusion:** The case hinges on whether Del Monte can prove validly the numerous AWOP violations and whether the rejection of Alsola's medical certificates was justified. The NLRC found that Del Monte failed to do so, leading to the ruling of illegal dismissal and the award of backwages and separation pay. Del Monte's risk lies in the lack of documentation, inconsistent application of company policy, and a potential suspicion that the dismissal was related to a retrenchment program.
