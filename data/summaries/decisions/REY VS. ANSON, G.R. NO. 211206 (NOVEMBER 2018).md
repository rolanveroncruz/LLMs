Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rosemarie Q. Rey v. Cesar G. Anson*, G.R. No. 211206, November 7, 2018. (842 Phil. 952)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision regarding loan recomputation and cancellation of real estate mortgages.

**Facts:** Rosemarie Rey (Petitioner) obtained four loans from Cesar Anson (Respondent) between 2002 and 2004. The first two loans were secured by real estate mortgages. The first loan was for P200,000 at 7.5% monthly interest; the second for P350,000 at 7% monthly interest. The third and fourth loans, each for P100,000, had verbal agreements for 3% and 4% monthly interest, respectively.  Rey made payments, but disputes arose concerning the interest rates.  Rey sued for recomputation, claiming usurious interest and overpayment, seeking cancellation of mortgages. The RTC partially granted the complaint; the CA reversed, finding the stipulated interest rates valid due to the suspension of the Usury Law.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Interest Rates:** The central issue is the validity of the stipulated interest rates of 7.5% and 7% *per month* on the first two loans. The Supreme Court (SC) held these rates to be excessive, unconscionable, iniquitous, and contrary to morals, thus void *ab initio*. This aligns with established jurisprudence (e.g., *Sps. Albos v. Sps. Embisan*, 748 Phil. 907 (2014); *Ruiz v. Court of Appeals*, 449 Phil. 419 (2003)) that, despite the suspension of the Usury Law, courts can still invalidate unconscionable interest rates under Article 1306 of the Civil Code. The SC reinstated the RTC's application of a 12% *per annum* legal interest on the principal of Loans 1 and 2, although this rate is outdated following *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* (716 Phil. 267 (2013)) which reduced it to 6% per annum for obligations not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, but increased it to 6% per annum from finality of decision for the interim period deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.
*   **Unwritten Interest:** The CA correctly ruled (and SC affirmed) that no interest was due on the third and fourth loans, as Article 1956 of the Civil Code requires interest stipulations to be in writing.
*   **Application of Payments:**  Petitioner argued, and the SC agreed, that payments should be applied first to interest and then to principal, according to Article 1253 of the Civil Code. The SC reviewed Petitioner's computations and adjusted the amounts deemed overpaid on each loan, including crediting excess payments from one loan to another.
*   **Solutio Indebiti:** The SC applied the principle of *solutio indebiti* (Article 2154, Civil Code) to require Anson to return the overpayments to Rey. However, consistent with *Sps. Abella v. Sps. Abella* (763 Phil. 372 (2015)), the SC did *not* award interest on the overpayments *until* the judgment becomes final and executory, given the mistake that caused such payments and equity considerations.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The SC agreed with the CA in denying attorney's fees to Rey, citing the general rule against their automatic recovery and the absence of justifying circumstances under Article 2208 of the Civil Code.
*   **Compensation:** The CA held that legal compensation under Article 1279 of the Civil Code is proper since Rey and Anson are creditors and debtors of each other and the obligations are due, liquidated, and demandable.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Rosemarie Rey:** Obligated to pay Cesar Anson the remaining principal balance of the first two loans, subject to legal interest of 6% per annum from the finality of the decision.
*   **Cesar Anson:** Obligated to return to Rosemarie Rey the amount of P269,700.68 representing overpayments on all four loans, with legal interest of 6% per annum only from the finality of the SC's decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement:** Disputes might arise in the actual computation of the final amounts due, requiring careful accounting based on the SC's guidelines.
*   **"Finality" Definition:** The exact date the SC decision becomes "final" for interest calculation might require clarification.
*   **Mortgage Cancellation:** Although the case discusses real estate mortgages, the SC decision focuses primarily on the monetary obligations. The implications for cancelling or maintaining the mortgages based on the final debt calculation should be carefully considered. If the remaining debt is small, a court order for cancellation could be pursued.
*   **Rate of legal interest**: the SC applies in its dispositive portion legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum, this must be clarified given the circumstances surrounding the obligation.

**Conclusion:**

The SC partially reversed the CA, ruling that the high monthly interest rates were unconscionable and applying a reduced legal interest rate. It also affirmed the requirement that interest agreements be in writing and addressed the application of payments and the principle of *solutio indebiti*. The case highlights the court's power to intervene in contracts with grossly unfair terms, despite the deregulation of interest rates. The need is to accurately recompute the loan balances based on the SC's decision and to address any remaining issues related to the real estate mortgages, if applicable.
