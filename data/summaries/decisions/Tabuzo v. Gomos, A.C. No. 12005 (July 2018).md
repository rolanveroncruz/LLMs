**Case:** *Achernar B. Tabuzo vs. Atty. Jose Alfonso M. Gomos*, A.C. No. 12005, July 23, 2018 (836 Phil. 297)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative complaint filed by Atty. Tabuzo against Atty. Gomos, then an IBP Commissioner, alleging violations of the Constitution, Rules of Court, R.A. No. 6713, and the Code of Professional Responsibility. The complaint stems from a prior administrative case (CBD Case No. 12-3457) where Gomos, as investigating commissioner, recommended sanctions against Tabuzo, which the IBP Board adopted.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Atty. Tabuzo accused Atty. Gomos of delay in resolving pleadings, misrepresentation of facts, nonfeasance in failing to initiate disciplinary actions against another attorney, and gross ignorance of the law. Essentially, Atty. Tabuzo's argument is that Atty. Gomos made an adverse judgment and should be sanctioned for it.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Gomos denied the allegations, asserting that Tabuzo's numerous motions caused the delay, and the IBP Board approved the report and recommendation. He viewed the complaint as harassment.
*   **IBP's Recommendation:** The IBP Commission recommended dismissal of the complaint, finding it an improper attempt to assail the IBP Board's decision and report and recommendation.

**Court's Ruling and Rationale:**

*   **IBP Commissioner's Status:** The Court ruled that the IBP is a *sui generis* public institution created through a collaborative effort of the legislative and judicial branches. However, IBP Commissioners are considered private practitioners performing public functions delegated by the Court. They are not public officers in the context of R.A. No. 6713 or the Revised Penal Code, and therefore are not subject to liability in the same manner.
*   **Delay:** The Court found that the alleged delay was primarily attributable to the complainant's filing of unsanctioned pleadings under the IBP-CBD Rules of Procedure, and the resolution of such pleadings is discretionary on the part of the court. The Rules of Procedure of the IBP-CBD provide that "[t]he only pleadings allowed are verified complaint, verified answer and verified position papers and motion for reconsideration of a resolution."
*   **Impropriety:** The Court emphasized that an administrative complaint is not the proper avenue to challenge adverse decisions when other remedies, like motions for reconsideration, are available.
*   **Warning:** The Court warned the complainant and her counsel against filing baseless administrative suits against fellow lawyers.

**Obligations:**

*   Lawyers have an obligation to treat each other with candor, respect, and dignity (Canon 8, Code of Professional Responsibility).
*   Lawyers must refrain from promoting or suing any groundless, false, or unlawful suit.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   Filing frivolous administrative complaints against fellow lawyers may lead to administrative sanctions for the complainant and collaborating counsel.
*   Misunderstanding the role of the investigating commissioner could lead to improper accusations and potential sanctions.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6397:** Enabled the Supreme Court to initiate integration of the Philippine Bar.
*   **P.D. No. 181:** Created the IBP as a corporate body.

*   ***In re: Cunanan, et al.*, 94 Phil. 534, 544 (1954):**  Admission, suspension, disbarment and reinstatement of attorneys at law in the practice of the profession and their supervision have been disputably a judicial function and responsibility.
*   ***Frias v. Atty. Bautista-Lozada*, 523 Phil. 17-20 (2006):** The [IBP CBD] derives its authority to take cognizance of administrative complaints against lawyers from this Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *sui generis* nature of the IBP's creation and its officers' dual roles (private practitioner, performing public function) could lead to confusion regarding liabilities and accountabilities.

**Legal Advice/Further Action:**

Advise clients to:

1.  Exhaust all available judicial remedies (e.g., motion for reconsideration, appeal) before filing administrative complaints.
2.  Thoroughly understand the Rules of Procedure of the IBP-CBD to avoid filing improper pleadings.
3.  Avoid frivolous or baseless administrative complaints against fellow lawyers, as they may lead to sanctions.
4. Recognize that officers of the IBP-CBD are private practitioners performing public functions delegated by the court.
