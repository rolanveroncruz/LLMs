**Case Summary: Chinese Young Men's Christian Association v. Remington Steel Corporation (G.R. No. 159422)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of YMCA's Petition for Review (CA-G.R. SP No. 74292) for failure to provide proof of authority for the signatory of the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Remington leased units from YMCA. Disputes arose regarding the termination of lease and access to Unit 963 via Units 964/966.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:** YMCA filed unlawful detainer suits against Remington for Units 964 and 966 (Civil Case Nos. 168629-CV and 168628-CV).
*   **Procedural Lapse:** The CA initially dismissed YMCA's petition due to a missing Secretary's Certificate proving the signatory's authority, specifically citing the mandatory nature of the requirement per *Spouses Melo v. Court of Appeals*, 376 Phil. 204 (1999).
*   **Forum Shopping Certification:** The central legal issue revolved around whether the lack of proof of authority for the signatory to the verification and certification against forum shopping, and its subsequent submission, was a fatal procedural defect.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, reversing the CA's dismissal. It held that while the certification is mandatory, subsequent submission of proof of authority (the Secretary's Certificate) constitutes substantial compliance, citing *Shipside Incorporated v. Court of Appeals*, 404 Phil. 981 (2001), and other related cases: *Havtor Management Philippines Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, General Milling Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, Pascual and Santos, Inc. v. The Members of the Tramo Wakas Neighborhood Association, Wack Wack Golf and Country Club v. National Labor Relations Commission, Vicar International Construction, Inc. v. FEB Leasing and Finance Corporation, Ateneo De Naga University v. Manalo, China Banking Corporation v. Mondragon International Philippines, Inc., LDP Marketing, Inc. v. Monter, Varorient Shipping Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, and Cana v. Evangelical Free Church of the Philippines.* The SC distinguished this case from *Melo*, which involved a complete failure to file the certification.
*   However, the SC did not remand the case to the CA. Instead, it applied the principle of *stare decisis et non quieta movere*, referencing its final Resolution in G.R. No. 171858 involving a similar case related to Unit 966 between the same parties. The previous ruling established that Remington unlawfully withheld possession due to ineffective constructive delivery.
*   Reasonable compensation was awarded to YMCA.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Remington's Obligation:** Remington had a legal obligation to surrender and return Unit 964 to YMCA. The padlock and lack of key handover constituted unlawful withholding of possession.
*   **Remington's Liability:**  Remington was liable to pay YMCA reasonable compensation for the use of the premises after the lease termination, from July 1, 1998, to March 12, 2004, set at P11,000.00 per month.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Stare Decisis:** Reliance on *stare decisis* could be challenged if facts are significantly different, but the Court considered them "substantially the same."
*   **Amount of Compensation:** Although the reasonable compensation was set, future disputes might arise regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this amount.
*   **Ambiguity:** The use of units 964 and 966 as passageway to second floor unit 963 could be a continuing source of contention

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 42, Sections 1 and 2, Rules of Court:** Regarding the requirement for verification and certification against forum shopping in Petitions for Review.
*   **Section 17, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court:** Authorizing the award of reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of leased premises.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Spouses Melo v. Court of Appeals***, 376 Phil. 204 (1999): Cited by the CA for the mandatory nature of the verification and certification requirement.
*   ***Shipside Incorporated v. Court of Appeals***, 404 Phil. 981 (2001): Key precedent used by the SC to justify substantial compliance in submitting the proof of authority later.
*   ***Remington Industrial Sales Corporation v. Chinese Young Men's Christian Association*** (G.R. No. 171858, August 31, 2007): Prior case between the parties involving a similar issue and setting the basis for *stare decisis*.
