## Legal Document Summary: People v. Sapigao, Jr., G.R. No. 178485, Sept. 4, 2009

**Case Summary:** This is an automatic review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the conviction of Mariano Sapigao, Jr. for murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The accused was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the murder of Alexander Turalba, qualified by treachery, and sentenced to reclusion perpetua.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, qualified by treachery (Art. 248, RPC).
*   **Facts:** The accused, along with a co-accused at large, allegedly conspired to shoot the victim. Prosecution witness testified the co-accused shot the victim in the back, and while the victim was lying face down, the accused shot him in the head with a .45 caliber handgun.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Eyewitness testimony (Cecilio Fabro) directly implicating the accused, corroborated by autopsy report.
    *   **Defense:** Alibi, denial, and testimony from a relative and ballistics and forensic experts suggesting the victim was shot only by the co-accused with a .38 caliber weapon and inconsistent with eyewitness testimony.
*   **Trial Court Finding:** Guilty of murder. Acquitted on illegal possession of firearms. Appreciated treachery as a qualifying circumstance.
*   **Appellate Court:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modification regarding damages, adjusting the awards and deleting actual damages due to lack of receipts, but awarding temperate damages.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the CA decision. Upheld the lower courts' reliance on eyewitness testimony and finding of treachery. Found credible the sequence of events outlined by prosecution.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Mariano Sapigao, Jr.):** Criminal liability for murder. Liable to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   P50,000 as civil indemnity.
    *   P50,000 as moral damages.
    *   P25,000 as temperate damages.
    *   P25,000 as exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Conflicting Testimonies:** The case hinges on the credibility of the prosecution's eyewitness versus the defense's witnesses, particularly regarding who shot the victim and with what weapon.
*   **Weapon Discrepancy:** The .45 caliber handgun was never recovered, and the defense argued the wounds were more consistent with a .38 caliber weapon. While expert testimony suggested only the co-accused inflicted wounds with a .38 caliber weapon, the Supreme Court cited *People v. Abriol* holding the entrance wound from a .45 caliber gun can be smaller depending on circumstances.
*   **Treachery:** This was used as a qualifying circumstance to elevate the crime to murder. The fact that the victim was shot in the back and then while lying face down on the ground constitutes treachery under Art. 14 of the RPC, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, ensuring its execution without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make.
* **Consolidation:** The case was consolidated from Criminal Case No. U-5035 with another criminal case docketed as Criminal Case No. U-4963 for illegal possession of firearms against the appellant and Sublingo arising out of the same incident. The prosecution acquitted the defendant of the charges for illegal possession of firearms.
