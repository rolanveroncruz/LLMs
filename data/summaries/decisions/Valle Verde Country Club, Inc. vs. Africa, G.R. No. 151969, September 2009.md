**Legal Document Summary: *Valle Verde Country Club, Inc. v. Africa*, G.R. No. 151969, September 4, 2009**

**Subject:** Validity of director election to fill vacancy created by resignation of hold-over director.

**Key Issue:** Can a corporation's board of directors elect another director to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of a hold-over director, or must this be done by the stockholders?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court ruled that *vacancies caused by the expiration of a director's term (even if the director is holding over) must be filled by the stockholders,* not by the remaining directors.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 23, Corporation Code:** Defines the term of directors as "one (1) year until their successors are elected and qualified." The Court interprets this to mean the *term* is one year, even if the director *holds over.*
*   **Section 29, Corporation Code:** Governs filling vacancies in the board of directors. Vacancies due to "expiration of term" *must* be filled by the stockholders. Vacancies due to other reasons (resignation, death) *may* be filled by the remaining directors (if a quorum exists) for the "unexpired term."
*   **Hold-Over Doctrine:** Directors continue to serve beyond their term until successors are elected. However, this hold-over period is considered part of their *tenure*, not an extension of their *term*.

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Invalid Director Elections:** Elections made by the board of directors to fill vacancies caused by the expiration of a hold-over director's term are invalid. Directors so elected lack authority, creating potential liability for actions taken.
*   **Potential for Shareholder Disputes:** Invalid elections can lead to shareholder suits challenging corporate actions, causing disruption and legal expenses.
*   **Violation of Stockholder Rights:** The ruling underscores the importance of stockholder participation in corporate governance. Bypassing stockholder elections undermines these rights and may result in legal challenges.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68):** Specifically, Sections 23 and 29 are central to the decision.
*   ***Government of the Philippine Islands v. El Hogar Filipino*, 50 Phil. 399 (1927):** VVCC cited this to justify the board's action.  The Court distinguished this case, stating that this was decided before the enactment of the current Corporation Code and that now Section 29 limits the instances when directors can fill in vacancies in the board.
*   **Definition of "Term":** *Topacio Nueno v. Angeles*, 76 Phil. 12 (1946) et al., defining "term" as the time one may claim to hold office as of right.
*   **Definition of Hold-Over Period:** *Gaminde v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 140335*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "term" in Section 23 is crucial. The court definitively states that it is one year, regardless of hold-over status.
*   Application of Section 29 to hold-over directors: This case clarifies that the term expiration, not the resignation of a hold-over director, is the key factor in determining who fills the vacancy.
    *   The court clarifies that there is no "unexpired term" after the expiration of the hold-over director's term.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Strict Compliance with Election Procedures:** Corporations must ensure strict compliance with the Corporation Code regarding elections, particularly when filling vacancies.  If the vacancy arises from term expiration (even with a hold-over), a stockholder vote is mandatory.
*   **Amending By-Laws:** Reviewing and amending corporate by-laws to align with this ruling is advisable.
*   **Defense Against Challenges:** In defending challenges to director elections, clearly demonstrate compliance with the Corporation Code's prescribed procedures.
*   **Power emanates from the stockholders:** The court reinforces that the board is a creation of the stockholders and its powers are derived from them.
*   **Board of directors occupies a trusteeship position:** The court also reiterates the board of directors' position in relation to the stockholders - it should not only exercise care and diligence, but utmost good faith in the management of corporate affairs.
