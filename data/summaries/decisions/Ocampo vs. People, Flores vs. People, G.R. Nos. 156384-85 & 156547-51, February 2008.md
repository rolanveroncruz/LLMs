## Legal Document Summary - *Mariano Un Ocampo III vs. People of the Philippines*

**Case:** *Mariano Un Ocampo III vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. Nos. 156547-51, February 4, 2008 (consolidated with G.R. Nos. 156384-85).

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reviewing a Sandiganbayan decision convicting Mariano Un Ocampo III (Governor of Tarlac) and Andres S. Flores (Executive Director of Lingkod Tarlac Foundation, Inc. - LTFI) of malversation of public funds.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** The core issue revolves around a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) where the Province of Tarlac, through Ocampo, loaned P56.6 million in National Aid for Local Government Units (NALGU) funds to LTFI for livelihood projects. The MOA allowed LTFI to "borrow funds directly from the Provincial Government...".
*   **Malversation Charges:** Ocampo and Flores were charged under Article 217 (Malversation of Public Funds) and Article 222 of the Revised Penal Code, respectively, for alleged misappropriation of P1,180,463.48 (Crim. Case No. 16794 - Juki embroidery machine discrepancy) and P58,000 (Crim. Case No. 16795 - unauthorized withdrawal).
*   **Discrepancy in Machine Cost:** The government alleged accused used 1.18M from the 8.86M loaned to cover the actual cost of the embroidery machines that cost less than 7.68M leaving a balance that wasn't returned.
*   **PNB 58,000 Misappropriation:** Accused also withdrew 58,000 for PNB account after the machines were already paid for.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Ocampo:** As Governor, initially responsible for safeguarding public funds (Sec. 203(t), Local Government Code of 1983) and representing the province in business transactions (Sec. 203(f), Local Government Code of 1983).
*   **Flores:** As Executive Director of LTFI, responsible for managing and accounting for funds received under the MOA.
*   **LTFI:** Obligation to repay the principal amount of the loan to the Province of Tarlac, as per the MOA.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sandiganbayan Ruling:** The Sandiganbayan initially found both guilty of malversation through negligence (Ocampo) and as a private individual in charge of public funds (Flores) under Art. 222, RPC. The Sandiganbayan also declared the MOA void due to Ocampo's lack of authority from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
*   **Supreme Court Reversal:** The Supreme Court reversed the Sandiganbayan's decision, acquitting both.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Characterization of Funds:** The central issue is whether the NALGU funds retained their "public" character after being loaned to LTFI. The Supreme Court determined they did not, citing Art. 1953 of the Civil Code. (Liwanag v. Court of Appeals G.R. No. 114398). Once ownership of the funds passed to LTFI, they ceased to be public funds subject to malversation.
*   **Validity of the MOA:** The Sandiganbayan initially deemed the MOA void due to the lack of Sangguniang Panlalawigan authorization, citing Sec. 203(f) of the Local Government Code and Rule XI of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1983.
*   **Unenforceable Contract:** The Supreme Court found the MOA was not void, but merely unenforceable due to lack of prior authorization, remediable by later ratification. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan subsequently ratified the MOA by approving the transfer of LTFI's obligations to BUILD (Tripartite Memorandum of Agreement) and authorising a Deed of Assignment between Province of Tarlac and LTFI. (Art. 1403 of the Civil Code).

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court overturned the Sandiganbayanâ€™s conviction based on the finding that the funds lost their public character upon being loaned to LTFI, thus precluding a finding of malversation. The lack of prior authorisation for the MOA was found to be curable through subsequent ratification by the Sanggunian.
