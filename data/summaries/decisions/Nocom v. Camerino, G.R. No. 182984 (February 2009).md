**Legal Document Summary: Nocom v. Camerino, G.R. No. 182984**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Date:** February 10, 2009

**Case Overview:** This case concerns the annulment of an Irrevocable Power of Attorney (IPA) granted by agricultural tenants (Respondents) to Mariano Nocom (Petitioner), and the propriety of a Summary Judgment issued by the RTC.  The RTC declared the IPA void, and the CA affirmed this, but was overturned by the Supreme Court decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Irrevocable Power of Attorney (IPA):** The central issue is the validity of the IPA granted by the Respondents to the Petitioner, empowering him to sell, assign, transfer, dispose of, mortgage, and alienate their rights over land they were entitled to redeem under a prior Supreme Court ruling (G.R. No. 161029).  The IPA also granted the Petitioner the right to receive proceeds and obtain titles in his own name.
*   **Prior Redemption Right:** The Respondents had a confirmed right of redemption from Springsun Management Systems Corporation (SMSC) in a previous case.
*   **Consideration:**  Petitioner paid each respondent P500,000, allegedly for their "inchoate and contingent rights."
*   **RTC Order:**  The RTC initially ordered annotation of the IPA on the newly issued titles in the respondents' names.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Champerty:** The RTC held the IPA to be a champertous agreement because it was brokered by the respondents' lawyer, Atty. Arturo Santos, and allowed the petitioner to pursue their claim at his own expense in exchange for the title, as the "absolute owner". *JBP Holding Corporation v. U.S. 166 F. Supp. 324 (1958) [defines a champertous contract]*. This creates potential liability for Atty. Santos for ethical violations and potential disbarment.
*   **Agrarian Reform Violation:** The RTC also held the IPA void as it was an attempt to circumvent the Agrarian Reform Code (RA 3844, Sec. 62), which limits the transferability of land acquired under the Code within a specified period. Specifically, the sale of their rights before they fully acquired the land was deemed a circumvention of agrarian reform policy *Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, et al., vs. Hon. Secretary of Agrarian Reform (G.R. No. 78742, July 14, 1989)*.
*   **Vitiated Consent:**  Respondents claim fraud, misrepresentation, and undue influence in the execution of the IPA. This directly challenges the validity of the contract.
*   **Summary Judgment Error:** The Supreme Court found that genuine issues of material fact exist, precluding Summary Judgment. The case should proceed to a full trial on the merits. This creates delays and increased legal costs.
*   **Non-Joinder of Indispensable Party:** The Respondents failed to implead Atty. Santos, who is alleged to have participated in the fraudulent transaction. This omission is not grounds for dismissal, but requires the RTC to order that Atty. Santos be impleaded, upon failure to do so, will result in dismissal per *Domingo v. Scheer, G.R. No. 154745, January 29, 2004, 421 SCRA 468.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 35, Rules of Court:** Regarding Summary Judgments. Specifically, Sections 1 and 3 define its requirements.
*   **Rule 41, Rules of Court:** Regarding appeals from the RTC.
*   **RA 3844 (Agrarian Reform Code), Sec. 62:** Limits on land rights, and the prohibition against transfers within a specific period.
*   **G.R. No. 161029:** The prior case establishing the Respondents' redemption rights.
*   **Circular No. 2-90:** Regarding the dismissal of appeals involving pure questions of law erroneously brought to the CA.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **"Irrevocable" Nature of IPA:** Whether the IPA is truly irrevocable, considering allegations of fraud, misrepresentation, and violation of Agrarian Reform laws. While purportedly "coupled with interest," its validity is questionable given the circumstances.
*   **Consideration Adequacy:** Whether the P500,000 payment to each Respondent constitutes fair and adequate consideration for their redemption rights.
*   **Nature of Civil Case No. 05-172:** While the SC clarifies it is currently a personal action (revocation of power of attorney), its potential to become a real action (recovery of ownership) remains a risk.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision due to the improper use of Summary Judgment. The case is remanded to the RTC for a full trial. Critical issues to focus on include proving (or disproving) fraud/misrepresentation, the alleged champertous nature of the IPA, the adequacy of consideration, and any violations of agrarian reform laws. Atty. Santos MUST be impleaded. The nature of the case as potentially a claim for recovery of ownership will also have to be carefully looked at to ensure compliance on docket fees.
