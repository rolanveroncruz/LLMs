**Case Summary: *Atty. Oliver O. Lozano and Atty. Evangeline J. Lozano-Endriano vs. Speaker Prospero C. Nograles* (G.R. No. 187883) and *Louis "Barok" C. Biraogo vs. Speaker Prospero C. Nograles* (G.R. No. 187910)**

**Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed petitions seeking to nullify House Resolution No. 1109, which called for Congress to convene to consider amending or revising the Constitution.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Constitutionality of House Resolution No. 1109:** The petitions challenged the resolution on the grounds that it potentially violated Section 1, Article XVII of the Constitution regarding amendment/revision procedures.
*   **Justiciability:** The central issue was whether the case presented a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial review.

**Legal Analysis:**

*   **Lack of Ripeness:** The Court held the issue was not ripe because:
    *   No actual convention had occurred.
    *   No rules of procedure had been adopted.
    *   No specific proposal for amendment/revision had been made.
    *   Therefore, no "positive act" by the House warranted intervention. Referencing *Tan v. Macapagal* (G.R. No. L-34161), the Court emphasized that intervention is premature until Congress finalizes concrete proposals.
*   **Lack of Locus Standi:** The Court found the petitioners lacked standing because:
    *   They failed to demonstrate personal, actual, or threatened injury resulting from the resolution.
    *   The injury was not directly traceable to the challenged action.
    *   A citizen/taxpayer suit was not valid because there was no disbursement of public funds. The resolution's potential impact was deemed insufficient to invoke the "transcendental importance" doctrine.
    *   The petitions didn't demonstrate vigorous and adversary presentation of the case.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution:** Defines the Court's jurisdiction over "actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable."
*   **Article XVII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution:** Addresses the procedure for amending or revising the Constitution.
*   ***Marbury v. Madison*, 1 Cranch 137:** Established the judiciary's duty to interpret the law.
*   ***Angara v. Electoral Commission*, 63 Phil. 139:** Defines the judiciary's role in allocating constitutional boundaries and limitations.
*   ***Tan v. Macapagal*, G.R. No. L-34161, February 29, 1972, 43 SCRA 677:** Court held that there's no jurisdiction until an amendment has been acted on.
*   ***Pascual v. Secretary of Public Works*, 110 Phil. 331 (1960):** Defined requirements for taxpayer's suit.
*   ***Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Guingona, Jr.*, G.R. No. 113375, May 5, 1994, 232 SCRA 110:** Established "transcendental importance" doctrine.
*   ***Tolentino v. COMELEC*, 465 Phil. 385, 402 (2004):** Requirements for locus standi.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Future Congressional Action:** The ruling does not preclude future challenges if Congress takes concrete steps towards amending/revising the Constitution that inflict actionable injury on a specific party.
*   **"Transcendental Importance" Doctrine:** The Court reiterated caution against abusing the liberalized standing rules, indicating potential future scrutiny of claims based solely on this doctrine.

**Summary for Legal Review:**

The Lozano and Biraogo petitions failed to meet the requirements for judicial review because the House Resolution was not yet ripe for adjudication and the petitioners lacked standing to sue. The court emphasized the need for a concrete injury and a specific proposal before judicial intervention is warranted in constitutional amendment cases. This ruling reinforces the principle of judicial restraint and deference to legislative processes in the absence of a clear and present violation of constitutional rights. The Court explicitly states that there must be an "actual controversy" as defined by Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution, and that courts cannot open doors to all parties claiming a grievance.
