## Legal Document Summary: *Marsh Thomson v. Court of Appeals and the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 116631, October 28, 1998)

**Summary:**

This Supreme Court case involves a dispute over the beneficial ownership of a Manila Polo Club (MPC) share acquired by the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, Inc. (AmCham) but registered in the name of its Executive Vice-President, Marsh Thomson. AmCham sued Thomson to compel him to transfer the share to its nominee. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, holding that AmCham is the beneficial owner of the MPC share based on an implied resulting trust and that Thomson is obligated to transfer the share to AmCham's nominee.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Implied Resulting Trust:**  The Court found that an implied resulting trust existed because AmCham provided the funds for the purchase of the MPC share, even though the title was placed in Thomson's name. This is based on the principle that "a trust arises in favor of one who pays the purchase money of property in the name of another" (*Tolentino, Civil Code of the Philippines, Vol. IV*).
*   **Beneficial Ownership:** The court ruled that AmCham retained beneficial ownership of the share, with Thomson only holding the *usufruct* (right to enjoy the benefits of membership).
*   **Obligation to Transfer:** Thomson is legally obligated to transfer the MPC share to AmCham's nominee.
*   **No Waiver via Quitclaim:** The general Release and Quitclaim executed by AmCham did not constitute a waiver of its ownership of the specific MPC share because it wasn't explicitly mentioned and a waiver of rights must be couched in clear and unequivocal terms.
*   **Non-Violation of MPC Rules:**  Transferring the share to AmCham's nominee (a natural person) does not violate the MPC's rules against corporate membership.
* **Statute of Limitations**: The statute of limitations did not apply to the repudiation of the trust, because the statute of limitations to recover movables is eight years and the case was filed within seven months.

**Obligations:**

*   **Thomson:**  Obligated to transfer the MPC share to the nominee designated by AmCham.
*   **AmCham:** Obligated to nominate a person who qualifies under the rules and regulations of the MPC to take the share.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Thomson:** Liable for costs of suit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **MPC Approval of Nominee:** The decision acknowledges that the transfer to AmCham's nominee is contingent on the nominee's approval by the Manila Polo Club. The potential risk here is the MPC rejecting AmCham's nominee, potentially requiring further legal action or negotiations.
*   **Tax implications:** The decision does not address any potential tax implications of the transfer, which could include capital gains taxes or other transfer taxes. The specific facts of the transfer will need to be analyzed.
*   **Good Faith in Trust** The Court held that because the necessary action was filed on time and good faith wasn't available to Thomson, there was no basis for any purported claim of prescription, after repudiation of the trust, which will entitle petitioner to ownership of the disputed share.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Alim vs. CA, 200 SCRA 450; Sasuhura Company, Inc., Ltd. vs. IAC, 205 SCRA 632:** Used to support that a contract has the force of law between the parties.
*   **Gatchalian vs. Delim, 203 SCRA 126, 132; citing Fernandez vs. Sebido, 70 Phil. 151 (1940); Lang vs. Provincial Sheriff of Surigao, et al., 93 Phil. 661 (1953); Andres vs. Crown Life Insurance Co., 102 Phil. 919 (1958); Yepes and Susaya vs. Samar Express Transit, 17 SCRA 91 (1966):** Used to support a waiver to be valid and effective must be couched in clear and unequivocal terms which leave no doubt as to the intention of a party to give up a right or benefit which legally pertains to him.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, art. 1140:** Actions to recover movables shall prescribe eight years from the time the possession thereof is lost.
*   **Civil Code, art. 1132:** Acquired ownership by prescription for less than four years if in good faith.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contentious clause is the Release and Quitclaim, which Thomson argued waived AmCham's right to the MPC share. The Court rejected this argument, finding that the quitclaim's general language was insufficient to waive a specific property right.
