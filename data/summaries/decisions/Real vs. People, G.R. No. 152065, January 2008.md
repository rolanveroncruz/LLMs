**Case Summary: *Belen Real vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 152065, January 29, 2008 (Estafa under Article 315, par. 1(b) RPC)**

**Facts:** Belen Real (Petitioner), an agent of Benjamin Uy (Private Complainant) for his jewelry business, received jewelry on commission with the obligation to remit proceeds or return unsold items. A Katibayan (receipt) documented Real's receipt of jewelry worth P371,500 with a 10-day sale/return deadline. Real later claimed the items were sold and promised payment via checks, which never materialized. Uy filed estafa charges after Real refused payment and became hostile.

**Issue:** Whether Real is guilty of estafa under Art. 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code and if the penalty imposed was proper.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for estafa, finding all elements present: receipt of property in trust, misappropriation/conversion, and prejudice to Uy.  However, the original penalty of 20 years of *reclusion temporal* was modified to comply with the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agency Relationship:**  Establishes a principal-agent relationship between Uy and Real, creating a fiduciary duty.
*   **Katibayan (Receipt):**  This document is crucial. It outlines:
    *   Receipt of specific jewelry items.
    *   Valuation of the items.
    *   Obligation to sell the items within 10 days on "Kaliwaan" (cash) basis.
    *   Obligation to return unsold items within 10 days.
    *   Obligation to remit proceeds promptly if sold.
    *   Prohibition against lending, pawning, or transferring the jewelry in any manner.
*   **Article 315, paragraph 1 (b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes estafa through misappropriation or conversion with abuse of confidence.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended):** Mandates an indeterminate sentence (minimum and maximum terms) for offenses under the RPC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Real is found guilty of estafa under Art. 315, par. 1(b) of the RPC.
*   **Civil Liability:** Real is liable to indemnify Uy for P371,500, representing the value of the misappropriated jewelry.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Kaliwaan":** Although the term is used, it is crucial to define the term "Kaliwaan" or cash payment. This definition could be challenged.
*   **Validity of the Katibayan:** Real's defense of signing a blank document was rejected, but a stronger evidentiary challenge (e.g., handwriting analysis disproving her signature) could raise doubts.
*   **Enforcement of Judgment:**  Uy faces the risk of Real being unable to pay the indemnity, resulting in uncollected damages.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Batulanon v. People, G.R. No. 139857, September 15, 2006:**  Disturbance of property rights constitutes damage for estafa purposes.
*   **Ceniza-Manantan v. People, G.R. No. 156248, August 28, 2007:**  Outlines the elements of estafa under Article 315, par. 1 (b) of the RPC.
*   **Perez v. People, G.R. No. 150443, January 20, 2006:** Application of Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 315, paragraph 1(b):** Defines the crime of estafa.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended by Act No. 4225):**  Governs the imposition of penalties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*"Ang aking gantimpala ay ang mapapahigit na halaga sa nakatakdang halaga sa itaas ng bawat alahas"* While commonly understood, this clause which defines Real's compensation may cause confusion.
**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the estafa conviction but corrected the penalty, imposing an indeterminate sentence to comply with the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Uy successfully demonstrated all elements of estafa.
