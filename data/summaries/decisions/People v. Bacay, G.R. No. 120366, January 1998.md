## Legal Document Summary: People v. Baccay, G.R. No. 120366

**Case Summary:**

This is a decision affirming the conviction of Domingo Baccay for Robbery with Homicide under the Revised Penal Code, for the death of Isabelo Jimenez and injuries to Heherson Jimenez, during a robbery.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Robbery with Homicide. Elements established: Taking of personal property with violence, property belonging to another, animo lucrandi, and homicide on the occasion of the robbery. (People vs. Cabiles, G.R. No. 113785)
*   **Accused:** Domingo Baccay and Laureto Baccay (co-accused, deemed unfit for trial).
*   **Facts:** Domingo and Laureto went to Isabelo's house, ostensibly to collect jueteng bets. Laureto began stabbing Isabelo and Heherson. Domingo assisted in the assault and took money from Isabelo's pocket.
*   **Evidence:** Eyewitness testimony from Gilbert Turaray (grandson), Heherson Jimenez (son), and Melchora Jimenez (wife). While Heherson's sworn statement taken by Pat. Alfonso Deraco was considered, the conviction relied primarily on live testimony.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between Domingo and Laureto based on their coordinated actions before, during, and after the crime. (Art. 8, par. 2, The Revised Penal Code)

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Domingo Baccay:**
    *   Guilty of Robbery with Homicide
    *   Sentence: *Reclusion perpetua* with accessory penalties.
    *   Restitution: P2,000.00 taken from Isabelo Jimenez.
    *   Indemnification: P50,000.00 for Isabelo's death; P66,470 for actual damages
    *   P150,000.00 for Heherson Jimenez's medical expenses.
    *   Moral and Exemplary damages were *deleted* due to insufficient proof.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Antemortem Statement/Res Gestae:** The defense challenged the admissibility of Heherson's sworn statement.  The court admitted the statement, but the conviction was not reliant on it, reducing the risk of appeal on this basis.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The defense attacked the credibility of Gilbert Turaray, alleging coaching and improbability of his observations. The court gave significant weight to his testimony, as well as Heherson's and Melchora's testimony.
*   **Amount of Stolen Money:** The defense questioned the amount of money stolen, based on inconsistencies in Melchora's testimony.  The court focused on the undisputed fact that *some* money was taken.
*   **Defense of Non-Flight:** The court dismissed Domingo's argument that his non-flight indicated innocence, arguing that his conduct suggested callousness instead.

**Key Case Law:**

*   **People vs. Cabiles, G.R. No. 113785:**  Cited for the elements of Robbery with Homicide.
* People v. Dunig and People v. Elizaga: Distinguished because the conviction did not rely solely on the testimony of the witness.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Offenses involving the taking of property by force or violence against or intimidation of any person.
*   **Article 8, par. 2, The Revised Penal Code:** Definition of Conspiracy

**Overall Assessment:**

The court upheld the conviction of Domingo Baccay for Robbery with Homicide, based on eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence indicating conspiracy. While the defense raised issues regarding witness credibility and the antemortem statement, the court found sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Moral and exemplary damages are deleted due to insufficient proof. The Court focused on restitution and actual damages.
