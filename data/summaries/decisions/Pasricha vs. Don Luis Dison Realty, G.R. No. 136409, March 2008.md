Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Subhash C. Pasricha and Josephine A. Pasricha vs. Don Luis Dison Realty, Inc.*, G.R. No. 136409, March 14, 2008.  (572 Phil. 52)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, appealing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) reversal of the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC) dismissal of an ejectment case.

**Facts:**

*   Don Luis Dison Realty, Inc. (Lessor/Respondent) entered into two lease contracts with Subhash and Josephine Pasricha (Lessees/Petitioners) for several units (Rooms 22, 24, 32, 33, 34, & 35, initially including 36, 37, & 38) in the San Luis Building.
*   Rent escalation clauses were included in the leases.
*   Petitioners stopped paying rent in May 1992, citing an internal dispute within the Respondent company regarding the authorized recipient of payments, and alleging they were prevented from using some of the leased units. They also claim Respondent failed to deliver Rooms 36-38.
*   Respondent filed an ejectment suit in the MeTC.

**Procedural History:**

*   **MeTC:** Dismissed the ejectment complaint, finding Petitioners' non-payment unjustified (should have consigned payment). Also held Ms. Bautista (acting for Respondent) lacked authority to sue.
*   **RTC:** Reversed the MeTC, ordering Petitioners to vacate, pay accrued rents, and attorney's fees (later deleted by CA). RTC found Ms. Bautista had implied authority as General Manager/Treasurer.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC decision (except for attorney's fees). Denied Petitioners' motions, including a motion for Justice Reyes' inhibition based on alleged bias.

**Issues:**

1.  Did Ms. Bautista have the authority to file the ejectment suit on behalf of the Respondent Corporation?
2.  Did the Respondent company have standing to sue given the suspension and revocation of their certificate of registration?
3.  Were Petitioners' non-payments justified due to (a) lack of access to the leased units, (b) non-delivery of Rooms 36-38, or (c) uncertainty regarding the proper recipient of payments?
4.  Was Justice Reyes' failure to inhibit himself a violation of due process?

**Holding:** Petition denied. CA decision affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Analysis:**

*   **Authority to Sue:** The Court relaxed the rules of procedure, finding that even though Ms. Bautista initially lacked documented authority, the subsequent presentation of the Secretary's Certificate confirming her authority to represent the company constitutes substantial compliance. *Novelty Phils., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, *Pfizer, Inc. v. Galan*, and *China Banking Corporation v. Mondragon International Philippines, Inc* cited regarding relaxation of procedural rules in the interest of justice.
*   **Corporate Standing:** Respondent had standing to sue because the ejectment action was initiated *before* the SEC revocation of its certificate of registration. Further, the subsequent setting aside of the revocation by the SEC rendered the issue moot.
*   **Justification for Non-Payment:**
    *   The court found *no* credible evidence to support the claim that Petitioners were prevented from using the units. The Court highlighted the absence of such complaints in initial communications.
    *   The Court rejected the argument that Respondent's failure to deliver Rooms 36-38 justified non-payment for the *other* leased rooms. The contracts were interpreted as severable leases, with obligations tied to specific rooms, not dependent on the delivery of all nine rooms.
    *   The Court emphasized that if the Petitioners truly didn't know to whom to pay, their remedy was *consignation* under Article 1256 of the Civil Code and *interpleader* under Rule 62 of the Rules of Court.  Their failure to utilize these remedies constituted unjustified non-payment. *State Investment House, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* cited re: necessity of consignation.
*   **Inhibition of Justice Reyes:** The motion for inhibition was deemed untimely as it was filed after Justice Reyes had already rendered his opinion. Furthermore, mere suspicion of bias is insufficient; there must be evidence of bias stemming from an *extrajudicial source*.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Lessees):** Obligated to pay rent as per the contracts of lease.  Liable for accrued rents.
*   **Respondent (Lessor):** Entitled to terminate the lease and eject Petitioners due to non-payment of rent, pursuant to Article 1673 of the Civil Code and the express terms of the lease agreements.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The relaxation of the rules regarding Ms. Bautista's authority to sue could be seen as creating a potential risk of unauthorized corporate action. However, the subsequent ratification mitigates this.
*   The interpretation of the leases as severable could be challenged if the contracts had contained language indicating an intention to lease *all* rooms or none.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1256 (consignation), 1258 (consignation procedure), 1673 (grounds for ejectment)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (appeals to Supreme Court), Rule 62 (interpleader)
*   **Corporation Code:** Implied powers of corporations.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the ejectment of the Petitioners due to their unjustified failure to pay rent. The Court emphasized the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and utilizing available legal remedies (consignation, interpleader) when facing uncertainty regarding payment. Procedural technicalities were relaxed in the interest of justice regarding the authority to sue.
