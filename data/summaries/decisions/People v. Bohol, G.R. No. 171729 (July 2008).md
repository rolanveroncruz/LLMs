Here's a legal summary of *People v. Bohol*, G.R. No. 171729:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Ricardo Bohol y Cabrino*, G.R. No. 171729, July 28, 2008

**Summary:** This case involves an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Ricardo Bohol for violating Sections 11(3) (possession) and 5 (sale) of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). Bohol was apprehended in a buy-bust operation where he sold "shabu" (methamphetamine hydrochloride) to a poseur buyer (PO2 Estrada).  He was also found in possession of additional sachets of "shabu."

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Sections Violated:**
    *   Section 5, Article II, RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs): Bohol was found guilty of selling 0.054 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride.
    *   Section 11(3), Article II, RA 9165 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs): Bohol was found guilty of possessing 0.118 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The case hinged on the validity of the buy-bust operation and subsequent warrantless arrest and search.
*   **Legality of Arrest & Search:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA decision, finding the arrest legal as Bohol was caught *in flagrante delicto* (in the act of committing a crime) selling drugs to the poseur buyer. This falls under the exception to the warrant requirement under Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The search was deemed a valid search incident to a lawful arrest, allowing seizure of evidence (shabu) from Bohol's person. *People v. Ayangao* and *Epie, Jr. v. Ulat-Marredo* are cited as precedent for valid warrantless searches incident to a lawful arrest.
*   **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** The SC agreed that the prosecution established Bohol's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, relying on the testimony of the police officers and the presentation of the corpus delicti (the drugs). The Court accorded credibility to the officers' testimony, citing the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty (*People v. Ambrosio*).  The Court gave deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility (*Aclon v. Court of Appeals*).
* Confidential informant presentation not required if sale is proven.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** While the decision doesn't explicitly mention a challenge on chain of custody, the summary doesn't provide detail about the chain. This is a potential area of attack if the chain of custody wasn't meticulously followed as it is a common argument in drug cases.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The defense might argue that the police actions constituted instigation rather than entrapment if they can argue the police induced the accused to commit a crime he would not have otherwise committed. However, the Court upheld the buy-bust as a valid form of entrapment.
*   **Lack of Informant Testimony:** While the Court ruled that presenting the informant is not a requirement, the absence of the informantâ€™s testimony could be a point of contention if the defense can show his testimony would have been material to the case or would raise reasonable doubt.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The Court corrected the CA's modification of the indeterminate sentence, restoring the original sentence imposed by the RTC, citing Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
