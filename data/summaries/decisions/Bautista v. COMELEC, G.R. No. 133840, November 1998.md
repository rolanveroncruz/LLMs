## Legal Document Summary: Bautista v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 133840)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (En Banc)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a pre-proclamation controversy concerning the mayoral election in Navotas, Metro Manila. Petitioner Cipriano "Efren" Bautista challenged the COMELEC's refusal to include "stray votes" (ballots marked "EFREN BAUTISTA", "EFREN", "E. BAUTISTA", or "BAUTISTA") in the canvass, arguing they represented valid votes for him.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Declaration of Nuisance Candidate:** COMELEC declared Edwin "Efren" Bautista a nuisance candidate before the election but his Motion for Reconsideration meant the ruling was not final on election day. However, the Supreme Court upheld this disqualification.
*   **Separate Tally Sheets:** Due to the ambiguity caused by the nuisance candidate, the COMELEC directed the BEI to tally the "stray votes" separately.
*   **Board of Canvassers' Duty:** The COMELEC initially held that the Board of Canvassers could only consider entries on the face of the election returns, excluding the separate tally sheets.
*   **Omnibus Election Code, Sec. 211 (4):** Cited by COMELEC in its decision, but the Court found it irrelevant under the circumstances.
*   **Voter Intent:** Court held that the paramount consideration is the intent of the voter, which was discernable in this case.

**Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC's Duty:** To ensure a faithful determination of the electorate's will.
*   **Board of Canvassers' Duty (as redefined by the Court):** Not just to canvass the face of the returns, but to consider the context of the election, including the nuisance candidate issue and the instructions to tally separately.

**Liabilities:**

*   No direct liability assigned.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Disenfranchisement:** The initial COMELEC decision risked disenfranchising a significant number of voters.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The case highlights the importance of timely resolution of nuisance candidate cases to avoid confusion on election day.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **The COMELEC's initial adherence to a strict interpretation of the Board of Canvassers' duty, ignoring the context of the election and the explicit instructions for separate tallying.** The Court found this application too rigid, prioritizing technicality over voter intent.
*   **The "stray votes" were not truly stray** because there was only one legitimate "Efren Bautista" candidate, a fact the COMELEC initially failed to fully appreciate.
*   **Defining the scope of the Board of Canvassers' duty** - The Court expanded it to include considering evidence beyond the face of the returns, in specific circumstances like the disqualification of a nuisance candidate.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the COMELEC decision, ordering the inclusion of the "stray votes" in Cipriano "Efren" Bautista's tally. The Court emphasized the paramount importance of upholding the electorate's will and ruled that the COMELEC should have considered the context of the election, the intent of the voters and Edwin Bautista's final disqualification as a nuisance candidate. The court resolved that the "stray votes" were actually votes for Bautista.
