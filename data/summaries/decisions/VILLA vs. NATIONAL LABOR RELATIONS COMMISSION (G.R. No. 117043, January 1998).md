## Legal Document Summary - *Felix Villa et al. vs. NLRC and National Steel Corporation (NSC)*, G.R. No. 117043

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging NLRC's decision that petitioners (members of NSCWA) were project employees and not regular employees of National Steel Corporation (NSC).

**Key Issue:** Whether workers contracted as project employees by NSC can be considered regular employees due to the nature of their work being inherent to NSC's business.

**Facts:**

*   NSC engaged in a Five-Year Expansion Program (FYEP).
*   Petitioners were hired under various projects related to FYEP, including a shipbreaking operation (later discontinued) and billet steelmaking plant.
*   NSCEA-SPFL (union) filed a notice of strike alleging unfair labor practices, including non-regularization of contractual employees.
*   Labor Minister issued a return-to-work order and directed NSC to submit records to determine regular contractual employees based on Art. 281 (now Art. 280) of the Labor Code.
*   Previous Supreme Court resolution (G.R. No. 76948) remanded the case to NLRC for factual determination of employees' status.
*   NLRC found petitioners to be mostly "contractual" or "casual employees," except those working alongside regular employees in the billet mill or providing admin/finance support.
*   NLRC considered the shipbreaking operation a “development project” and its phasing out valid.
*   NLRC initially determined which worker qualified as regular, and then the NLRC rendered a resolution ruling that the project employees are not regular.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 280 (formerly 281) of the Labor Code:** Defines regular, project, and casual employees. The core contention revolves around whether petitioners' work was "usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer" (regular employee) or tied to a "specific project or undertaking" (project employee).
*   **Project Employment Contracts:** The document acknowledges the validity of project employment contracts where the employment is coterminous with a specific project.
*   **NSC's Obligation:** Initially directed to submit employee records to determine "regular contractual employees". Also, ordered give priority to its contractual workers, with first priority to those who may be regularized, if any, in the hiring of new personnel.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NSC's Potential Liability:** Had NLRC found the workers were actually performing regular functions instead of project, NSC could have been liable for backwages, regularization, and benefits associated with regular employment.
*   **Petitioners' Risk:** Remaining classified as project employees means their employment is tied to specific projects, with no guarantee of continued employment after project completion.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***ALU-TUCP v. NLRC***: This case is crucial as it also involved NSC's FYEP I and II and the classification of workers as project employees. It establishes the distinction between regular business projects and undertakings outside the regular business. NSC undertook the ambitious Five Year Expansion Program I and II with the ultimate end in view of expanding the volume and increasing the kinds of products that it may offer for sale to the public.
*   ***Beta Electric Corporation v. NLRC***: The NLRC mentions that the worker claim that the multiple contract renewal should result to regularization because it circumvents the law.
*   ***Mercado, Sr. v. NLRC***: The NLRC cited the case to emphasize the ruling that the "one year" proviso in the Labor Code's Art 280 applies only to casual, not project, employees.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core ambiguity is whether the shipbreaking operation and other activities performed by petitioners were "usually necessary or desirable" to NSC's steel production business, or separable projects under the FYEP. Petitioners argued the former, citing the NSC's brochure and their actual work assignments.
*   Interpretation of the "notwithstanding" clause in Article 280 of the Labor Code regarding written agreements is also contentious.
*   The decision emphasizes the fact that contracts of employment are prepared by management.
*   The decision mentions that the petitioners were promised reemployment after 20 days.

**NLRC's Rationale and the Supreme Court's Acceptance**

*   NLRC concluded the workers are project employees due to NSC's undertaking of major expansion projects (FYEP I and II).  NLRC found the shipbreaking operation a “development project” that was properly phased out. Even if services rendered were necessary or desirable they do not pertain to the usual business or trade of the employer, activity still falls short of being considered regular employment under the law.
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC decision, emphasizing that factual findings of labor tribunals with expertise are generally respected. The Palomares v. NLRC case, which also involved NSC workers from the same expansion program, was cited as precedent that "services necessary" in business operation of NSC did not impair the valid contract.

**Overall Assessment & Risks:**

*   The Supreme Court upheld the NLRC's decision, which classified the petitioners as project employees. This aligns with previous jurisprudence regarding NSC's FYEP (ALU-TUCP v. NLRC).
