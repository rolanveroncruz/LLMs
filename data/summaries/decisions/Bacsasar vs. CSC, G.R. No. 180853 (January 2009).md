## Legal Document Summary: Bacsasar v. Civil Service Commission (G.R. No. 180853)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Certiorari seeking to nullify Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions affirming the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) decision to dismiss Manicam Bacsasar (Petitioner) from service for dishonesty. The CSC-ARMM initially found Petitioner guilty of dishonesty for misrepresenting in her Personal Data Sheet (PDS) that she passed the Career Service Professional examination. The CSC upheld this decision, and the CA dismissed Petitioner's appeal due to tardiness and lack of merit. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dishonesty Charge:** Petitioner was charged with dishonesty under Civil Service regulations for indicating in her PDS that she passed the Career Service Professional Exam based on a spurious certificate.
*   **Waiver of Formal Investigation:** Petitioner waived her right to a formal investigation before the CSC-ARMM.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** Petitioner filed her Petition for Review with the CA beyond the extended deadline, rendering the CSC decision final and executory.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The SC found that substantial evidence supported the CSC's finding of dishonesty, specifically the certification from CSC-NCR confirming Petitioner's name was not on the passing list.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation of eligibility, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in government service, as a consequence of being found guilty of dishonesty.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dismissal from Service:** Petitioner is dismissed from her position as Municipal Assessor.
*   **Forfeiture of Benefits:** Petitioner forfeits her retirement benefits.
*   **Loss of Eligibility:** Petitioner's civil service eligibility is cancelled.
*   **Perpetual Disqualification:** Petitioner is perpetually disqualified from reemployment in the government service.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Decision:** The SC upheld the CA and CSC decisions, solidifying the penalties against the Petitioner. There is no further recourse.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Dishonesty Definition:** The SC cited *Civil Service Commission v. Cayobit, 475 Phil. 452, 460 (2003)* for the definition of dishonesty.
*   **Perfection of Appeal:** The SC cited *Emerlinda S. Talento v. Hon. Remegio M. Escalada, Jr.* regarding the mandatory nature of timely appeals.
*   **Due Process in Administrative Proceedings:** The Court elaborated on the requirements of due process, citing multiple cases.
*   **Good Faith:** The SC cited *Civil Service Commission v. Maala, G.R. No. 165253, August 18, 2005, 467 SCRA 390, 399* to establish that Good faith is a question of intention.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Defense:** Petitioner argued lack of knowledge that her eligibility was spurious, claiming she acted in good faith. The CA and SC rejected this defense, citing her failure to reasonably verify the eligibility and her reliance on a known "fixer."
*   **Due Process Argument:** Petitioner argued she was denied due process because no formal investigation took place. This was rejected because she waived her right to a formal hearing.

**Concise Legal Precision:**

The SC upheld the dismissal of Petitioner based on substantial evidence of dishonesty, stemming from the use of a spurious Civil Service eligibility. Procedurally, the Petition was denied due to the late filing of the appeal. Substantively, the SC found no reversible error in the lower courts' decisions. This case reinforces the stringent consequences for dishonesty in public service and the importance of adhering to procedural rules in appeals.
