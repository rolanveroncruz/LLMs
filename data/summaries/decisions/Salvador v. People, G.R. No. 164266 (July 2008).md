## Legal Document Summary: *Salvador v. People*, G.R. No. 164266 (2008)

**Case:** *Nover Bryan Salvador v. People of the Philippines* concerns the conviction of the petitioner for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which, in turn, affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment finding the petitioner guilty based on circumstantial evidence.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Homicide (Art. 249, Revised Penal Code) for the death of Arlene Zuñiga, petitioner's sister-in-law.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:**
    *   No forced entry.
    *   No items stolen.
    *   Bloodstains were only found in victim's room
    *   Petitioner possessed a "balisong" (folding knife), which matched the type of weapon used.
    *   Type "O" blood (victim's blood type) was found on petitioner's shirt and briefs.
    *   DNA analysis suggested a link between petitioner and the bloodstains, along with hair strands.
    *   Petitioner's unusual behavior (crying and proclaiming innocence without accusation) after the discovery of the body.
*   **Petitioner's Defense:** Denial, claiming he owned a samurai (double bladed knife), not a balisong.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Found petitioner guilty of Homicide based on the totality of circumstantial evidence.
*   **Appellate Court Ruling:** Affirmed RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision with modification to the indeterminate penalty.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner found guilty of Homicide and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum.
*   Petitioner is liable to indemnify Spouses Zuñiga (victim's parents):
    *   P50,000.00 for the death of Arlene Zuñiga (*indemnity ex delicto*).
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages.
    *   P25,000.00 as temperate damages.
    *   Costs of Suit

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** Conviction rests heavily on circumstantial evidence. The petitioner challenged the sufficiency of each circumstance independently, arguing that the NBI findings are inconsistent and the other circumstances are insufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **DNA Evidence:** While DNA analysis placed the petitioner at the scene, the weight given to this evidence is contested by the petitioner based on supposed inconsistencies with other NBI reports.
*   **Motive:** The court cited prior "peeping" incidents as establishing motive/intent. The connection between these incidents and the actual killing may be viewed as tenuous.
*   **Sentence Modification:** The Supreme Court modifies the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty, demonstrating a willingness to correct errors even if not specifically raised in the petition.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 249, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Homicide.
*   **Rule 133, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Defines the requirements for sufficient circumstantial evidence for conviction.
