**Legal Document Summary: *Estrada v. Sandiganbayan***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 217682, July 17, 2018 (836 Phil. 281)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus challenging the Sandiganbayan's denial of a motion to suppress evidence (AMLC Inquiry Report and testimony thereon) in a plunder case (Criminal Case No. SB-14-CRM-0239) against Senator Jose "Jinggoy" P. Ejercito Estrada.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **AMLC Inquiry Report:** The admissibility of the AMLC's Inquiry Report on bank transactions, obtained pursuant to an *ex parte* application under R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act), as amended by R.A. No. 10167, in a plunder case against Estrada related to the PDAF scam.
*   **Constitutionality of Section 11 of R.A. No. 9160, as amended:** Petitioners argued that the *ex parte* bank inquiry order provision violates the constitutional rights to due process and privacy. They claimed it enables "fishing expeditions" and that the disclosure of "related accounts" is a "fruit of the poisonous tree."
*   **Retroactive Application of R.A. No. 10167:** Petitioners contended that applying R.A. No. 10167 (allowing *ex parte* application) retroactively to bank transactions prior to its effectivity (June 18, 2012) violates the prohibition against *ex post facto* laws.
*   **Standing:** Whether Ma. Presentacion Vitug Ejercito (Estrada's wife) had standing to challenge the Sandiganbayan resolutions, as she wasn't a party in the original criminal proceedings.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **AMLC Obligation:** To establish probable cause before seeking a bank inquiry order from the Court of Appeals.  The AMLC is acting as an investigatory body, not exercising quasi-judicial functions at this stage.
*   **Bank Account Holders:** Subject to bank inquiry orders if probable cause exists connecting their accounts to money laundering or other predicate offenses.  They have recourse after a freeze order is issued.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Collateral Attack on a Statute:** Challenging the constitutionality of R.A. No. 9160, as amended, in a petition for certiorari rather than a direct action. The Court considered this a collateral attack, which is disfavored.
*   **Privacy Rights vs. State Interest:** Balancing the constitutional right to privacy in bank accounts against the state's interest in combating money laundering and corruption.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act), as amended by R.A. No. 10167:** Central statute governing bank inquiry orders and the role of the AMLC. Section 11 allows for *ex parte* applications.
*   ***Subido Pagente Certeza Mendoza and Binay Law Offices v. Court of Appeals*** (G.R. No. 216914, December 6, 2016):  Key precedent upholding the constitutionality of the *ex parte* bank inquiry provision in Section 11 of R.A. No. 9160, as amended.
*   ***Republic v. Eugenio, Jr.*** (545 SCRA 384):  Cited by petitioners regarding the application of the *ex post facto* clause to R.A. No. 9160. The Court distinguished this case.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Regarding the requirements for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus, including the requirement of being an "aggrieved party."

**Court's Ruling:**

1.  **Constitutionality Upheld:** Section 11 of R.A. No. 9160, as amended, is constitutional. It does not violate due process or the right to privacy because the AMLC is merely conducting an investigation, not exercising quasi-judicial powers.
2.  ***Ex Post Facto* Clause Not Violated:** R.A. No. 10167 is not an *ex post facto* law because it does not criminalize prior acts, aggravate crimes, or change punishments. It merely eliminates the notice requirement for bank inquiry applications.
3.  **Mootness:** The petition was dismissed as moot and academic because Estrada had already been granted bail by the Sandiganbayan. The issues raised were relevant to his bail hearing, and the grant of bail rendered the legal questions without practical effect.

**Implications:**

This case reinforces the constitutionality of the AMLC's power to conduct *ex parte* bank inquiries under R.A. No. 9160, as amended. It clarifies that this power is investigatory, not adjudicatory, and does not violate due process or the prohibition against *ex post facto* laws. However, the court noted that a person subject of an investigation can always question the issuance of the bank inquiry order, after a freeze order is issued against the account.
