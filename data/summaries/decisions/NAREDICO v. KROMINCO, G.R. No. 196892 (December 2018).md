Okay, here is a legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Naredico, Inc. v. Krominco, Inc.* G.R. No. 196892 (Dec. 5, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA Decision that reinstated the Mines and Geosciences Bureau Panel of Arbitrators' decision, favoring Krominco over a mining area dispute.

**Key Issue:**  Whether Naredico or Krominco has the superior right to a contested mining area due to overlapping contract areas stemming from an Operating Contract (Krominco) and a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) (Naredico).

**Facts:**

*   **Krominco's Prior Contract:**  Krominco had an operating contract with the government. A subsequent "Amended Survey Plan" expanded Krominco's operating area, allegedly encroaching on an area applied for by Naredico.
*   **Naredico's MPSA:** Naredico subsequently obtained an MPSA, which included a colatilla that its contract area would exclude areas covered by valid and subsisting mining rights.
*   **Conflicting Surveys:** Engineer Illana found overlaps between Naredico's agreement and the amended survey plan.
*   **DENR Secretary Alcala's Decision:** The DENR initially ruled in favor of Naredico, invalidating Krominco's Amended Survey Plan, but this was reversed by subsequent decisions.
*   **Panel of Arbitrators (POA) Decision:** Ruled in favor of Krominco, stating they had better rights to the overlap area.
*   **Mines Adjudication Board (MAB) Decision:** Modified the POA decision, awarding the area occupied by Krominco's structures to Krominco and the remaining area to Naredico.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA) Decision:** Reversed the MAB decision and reinstated the POA decision, relying on the "first-in-time, first-in-right" principle and finding Naredico had knowingly agreed to the exclusion of areas with existing mining rights.
*   **Supreme Court** Ruled in favor of Naredico, reversing the CA decision and reinstating the MAB decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Krominco Operating Contract:**  Specifically, Section 1.1 concerning the contract area and its description is critical. The final operating area was "subject to actual survey and verification." This clause became contentious, with Krominco arguing it covered their actual operational areas, even if outside the original coordinates.  The specific terms of the original operating contracts (1977, 1978) and the later revised operating contract (1989) were key. The term of the contract and renewal provisions were also central to Naredico's claim.
*   **Naredico MPSA:** Section IV contained the critical colatilla excluding areas covered by "valid and subsisting mining rights." The interpretation of "valid and subsisting" became a point of contention.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Overlap Area:**  The primary risk involves which party can legally explore, develop, and utilize the overlap area. This dictates potential revenue streams and development plans.
*   **Damages:** If Naredico was improperly excluded from the area, they may have a claim for damages against Krominco for ore extracted. This was initially contemplated in Secretary Alcala's order.
*   **Contractual Breach:**  The government could face claims if either party's contract is deemed to have been improperly impaired.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995):**  Governs mining rights, agreements, and dispute resolution. Sections 77-79 are relevant regarding the jurisdiction of the Panel of Arbitrators and the Mines Adjudication Board.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 99-A:** Referenced for the "first-in-time, first-in-right" principle (though ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court).
*   **Philippine Bill of 1902** Historical context to mining rights.
*   **Constitution:** Article XII relevant for state control over mining, also cites the 1935, 1943, 1973 and 1987 constitutions.
*   **Apex Mining Co., Inc. v. Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corp.** (525 Phil. 436 (2006): The CA relied upon Bersamin's separate opinion in this case to apply the "first-in-time, first-in-right". The Supreme Court clarifies that this was a separate opinion and obiter dictum.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Subject to actual survey and verification" Clause (Krominco Operating Contract):**  The core ambiguity. Does it mean the survey could override the initial coordinate description, or was it merely for precise delineation within those coordinates?
*   **"Valid and Subsisting Mining Rights" Colatilla (Naredico MPSA):**  What constitutes "valid and subsisting?"  Did the Amended Survey Plan create a valid right? Did Krominco's rights lapse when the initial contract term expired?
*   **Expiration and Renewal of Krominco's Operating Contract:**  Naredico argued the initial contract expired and was not properly extended.  The government's actions in granting extensions and a Special Mines Permit introduced complexity.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *reverses* the Court of Appeals decision and reinstates the Mines Adjudication Board Decision.
*   Rejects the "first-in-time, first-in-right" principle.
*   The SC defers to the MAB's findings as it has expertise and technical knowledge over mining rights.
*   Upholds the MAB decision, which granted Naredico the area, except for the areas over which Krominco's structures, equipment, and main ore body are situated.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   **Naredico:** Can argue that the Supreme Court decision has settled the matter, entitling them to the mining rights to the contested area, less the space used by Krominco.
*   **Krominco:** Can argue for a precise survey to define its area.

**Risks to Naredico:**

*   Costs of survey.
*   Interference.

**Risks to Krominco:**
*   Reduced contract area.
*   Must surrender areas to Naredico.

**Note:** It would be useful to examine the specific coordinates and maps referenced in the original contracts and survey plans.
