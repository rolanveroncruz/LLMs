Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Goldstar Rivermount, Inc. vs. Advent Capital and Finance Corp., G.R. No. 211204, December 10, 2018*

**Subject Matter:** Validity of a *dacion en pago* (dation in payment) agreement.

**Facts:**

*   Goldstar (debtor) borrowed from Advent (creditor).
*   Goldstar defaulted.
*   Goldstar and Advent executed a *dacion en pago* and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) giving Goldstar a right to redeem.
*   Goldstar claims the *dacion* is void because Advent had previously assigned its receivables from the loan to DBP.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Goldstar's initial obligation to repay the loan to Advent.
*   **Real Estate and Chattel Mortgages:** Security for the loan.
*   ***Dacion en Pago:*** Transfer of mortgaged properties from Goldstar to Advent as payment for the outstanding debt. *Obligation for Goldstar to transfer title.*
*   **MOA (Right of Redemption):** Granted Goldstar the right to redeem the properties within one year and the right to lease it for a monthly rental of P600,000.00. *Obligation for Goldstar to pay the agreed rate.*
*   **Deed of Assignment (Advent to DBP):** Assignment of Advent's receivables to DBP to secure Advent's own loan with DBP. *Key clause: DBP could only exercise its rights as assignee upon Advent's default.* Sections 8, 9, 10 and 12 are crucial.
*   **Amendment and Addendum:** Later agreement between Advent and DBP giving DBP management rights without needing Advent's default. This document is not valid, as the Dacion en Pago was already signed.

**Issues:**

*   Whether the Deed of Assignment was merely security for Advent's loan to DBP, precluding DBP from acting as creditor before Advent's default.
*   Whether DBP's letter to Goldstar constituted a valid exercise of its rights, effectively making DBP Goldstar's new creditor.

**Court's Ruling (Affirming CA):**

*   The Deed of Assignment was security for Advent's debt to DBP.
*   DBP could only exercise its rights under the Deed of Assignment if Advent defaulted.
*   No evidence of Advent's default at the time of the *dacion en pago*. Sections 8,9, 10 and 12 of the Deed of Assignment are relevant in making this conclusion.
*   Advent had authority under the Deed of Assignment (Section 10) to act as DBP's attorney-in-fact and enter into contracts with Investment Enterprises, such as Goldstar, to secure payment.
*   DBP's letter was immaterial because it was based on the Amendment and Addendum, which was executed *after* the *dacion*. Article 1315 of the New Civil Code applies.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Goldstar:** Liable to fulfill the terms of the *dacion en pago* and deliver title to the properties. Risk of losing the properties if they fail to honor the Dacion en Pago.
*   **Advent:** While the ruling is in their favor, future challenges based on potential breaches of the Deed of Assignment with DBP remain a risk, although unlikely given this judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1159, New Civil Code:** Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law.
*   **Article 1315, New Civil Code:** Contracts are perfected by mere consent.
*   **Hilltop Market Fish Vendors' Association, Inc. v. Hon. Yaranon, G.R. No. 188057, July 12, 2017**
*   **Ka Kuen Chua, doing business under the name and style Ka Kuen Chua Architectural v. Colorite Marketing Corp., G.R. Nos. 193969-70 and 194027-28, July 5, 2017.**
*   **Dee Hwa Liang Foundation Medical Center and Anthony Dee v. Asiamed Supplies and Equipment Corp., G.R. No. 205638, August 23, 2017.**
*   **De Los Santos v. Lucenio G.R. No. 215659, March 19, 2018.**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Interpretation of the Deed of Assignment regarding when DBP could exercise its rights as assignee. The court interpreted it narrowly, requiring Advent's default *prior* to the *dacion*.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court upheld the validity of the *dacion en pago* because Advent retained the power to manage and collect the loan at the time the agreement was made. Goldstar's attempt to invalidate the *dacion* based on a later amendment to the Deed of Assignment failed. The decision emphasizes the importance of contractual interpretation and the binding nature of contracts.
