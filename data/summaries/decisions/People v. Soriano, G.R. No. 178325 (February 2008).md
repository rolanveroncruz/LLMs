## Legal Document Summary: People v. Soriano, Sr. (G.R. No. 178325)

**Case Summary:** This is a criminal case appeal where Dominador Soriano, Sr. was convicted of two counts of qualified rape against his 12-year-old daughter (AAA). The initial trial court decision sentenced him to death, which was later modified by the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation:** Article 266-A, Section 1, paragraphs (a) and (c) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353 and RA 7659) - Rape through force, threat, intimidation, and grave abuse of authority.
*   **Proof of Offense:** Prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had carnal knowledge of his daughter on multiple occasions, resulting in pregnancy and childbirth.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Initial Sentence:** Death (trial court and appellate court)
*   **Final Sentence (SC):** Reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole for each of the two counts of qualified rape, due to RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty.
*   **Civil Liability:** Increased from the trial court's order
    *   Civil Indemnity: P150,000
    *   Moral Damages: P150,000
    *   Exemplary Damages: P50,000

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Duplicity of Offense:** The Information charged multiple offenses (multiple rape incidents) in a single count, violating Section 13, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. However, because the defense didn't object before trial, the SC upheld the conviction for as many offenses that were proven.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The mother of the victim presented an affidavit of desistance purportedly signed by AAA. This was deemed unreliable by the Court. AAA refused to validate it, and the mother admitted it was conditional on the appellant leaving the family. Philippine jurisprudence disfavors affidavits of desistance, especially in rape cases.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense raised the issue of inconsistencies in AAA's testimony (regarding whether her undergarments were removed). The court considered these minor details and did not discredit AAA's overall consistent and believable testimony.
*   **No Crime of "Multiple Rape":** While the trial and appellate courts found Soriano guilty of "multiple rape," the SC clarified there is no such crime. He was convicted of two distinct counts of qualified rape.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353 and RA 7659):** Definition of Rape.

*   **People v. Suarez, et al., G.R. Nos. 153573-76:** Minor inconsistencies do not affect credibility.
