## Legal Document Summary - *Saberon v. Larong*, A.C. No. 6567 (2008)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer (Atty. Larong) for using abusive language in pleadings filed before the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Complainant (Saberon) filed a petition before the BSP against a bank and its majority stockholder, Bonpin, related to the return of collaterals for a loan allegedly fully paid.
*   Respondent (Larong), as in-house counsel for the bank, filed an Answer and Rejoinder, characterizing Saberon's suit as a "blackmail suit."
*   Saberon filed a complaint alleging grave misconduct for the use of abusive and offensive language.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Larong is found guilty of **simple misconduct** for violating Canons 8 and 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) regarding courtesy, fairness, candor, and respect towards courts and judicial officers. This includes:
    *   Rule 8.01: Not using abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper language in professional dealings.
    *   Rule 11.03: Abstaining from scandalous, offensive, or menacing language before the Courts.
*   Atty. Larong is fined P2,000 and given a stern warning.
*   Lawyers have an obligation to use dignified language even in pleadings.
*   Lawyers must not trench beyond the bounds of relevancy and propriety in remarks or comments, even within the scope of privileged communications.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in the "Privileged Communication" Doctrine:** While statements made in judicial proceedings are privileged, this protection only extends to matters "pertinent and relevant to the subject of inquiry." The Court found the "blackmail" allegation irrelevant to the issues before the BSP.
*   **Subjectivity of "Abusive Language":** The determination of what constitutes "abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper" language can be subjective and fact-specific, potentially leading to inconsistent application of the CPR.
*   **IBP Board of Governors Resolution:** The Court noted the IBP Board of Governor's initial resolution was deficient as it didn't clearly state the facts and legal reasoning behind the dismissal. This is a procedural issue relating to the review process under Rule 139-B, Sec. 12.
*   **Proportionality of Sanction:** Complainant argued for disbarment, but the Court determined simple misconduct was more appropriate in light of respondent's apology.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Canons 8 and 11, Rules 8.01 and 11.03. This is the core basis for the disciplinary action.
*   **Rule 139-B, Section 12 (a) of the Revised Rules of Court**: lays out procedural requirement that the IBP Board of Governors' decision shall state clearly and distinctly the findings of facts or law on which the same is based.
*   **Go v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 106087, April 7, 1993, 221 SCRA 397, 420:**  Cites the adversarial nature of legal system can tempt lawyers to use strong language.
*   **Lubiano v. Gordolla, A.C. No. 2343, July 30, 1982, 115 SCRA 459, 462:** Lawyer remain a member of the bar regardless of the forum.
*   **Uy v. Atty. Depasucat, 455 Phil. 1, 21 (2003):**  The case of Uy further establishes that lawyer's language must be dignified.

**Potential Legal Arguments (Defense):**

*   Respondent could argue the language used was not *intended* to be abusive, and was within the scope of zealous advocacy.
*   Respondent might raise a good faith defense, arguing the statements were based on a reasonable belief supported by the facts known at the time.

This summary highlights the key aspects of the case, focusing on potential legal issues and liabilities associated with the use of language in legal pleadings. It flags the ambiguous nature of "abusive language" and the requirement for relevance in privileged communications, providing a foundation for further legal analysis.
