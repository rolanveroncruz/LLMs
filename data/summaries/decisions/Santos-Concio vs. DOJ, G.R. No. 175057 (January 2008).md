## Legal Document Summary: *Santos-Concio v. DOJ* (G.R. No. 175057)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Case Summary:** Petitioners, ABS-CBN executives, challenged DOJ Department Orders creating panels to investigate and conduct a preliminary investigation into the "Ultra Stampede" that occurred during a "Wowowee" event, arguing bias and procedural irregularities. The SC affirmed the CA decision dismissing their petition.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Investigatory Power of the DOJ:** Affirms the DOJ's general investigatory powers under the Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292, Book IV, Title III, Chapter 1).
*   **Preliminary Investigation Procedure (Rule 112, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure):** Details the requirements for initiating a preliminary investigation, clarifying the nature of the "complaint" required (affidavits of competent witnesses sufficient, no need for a single sworn complaint-affidavit from the "complainant," unlike a formal "complaint or information" in court).
*   **Probable Cause:**  Reiterates that preliminary investigation is conducted to elicit further facts or evidence. Focus is not on making a determination of guilt.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential criminal liability for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Multiple Homicide and Physical Injuries (Art. 365, RPC) if probable cause is established.
*   Civil liability alluded to in Secretary Gonzalez's statements.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finding of Probable Cause:**  The ongoing preliminary investigation could result in a finding of probable cause and the filing of information against the petitioners.
*   **Negative Publicity:** The public nature of the case and the involvement of a major media outlet could lead to further negative publicity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292, Book IV, Title III, Chapter 1):** Grants the DOJ general investigatory powers.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 365:**  Defines and penalizes reckless imprudence.
*   **Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, Rule 112:** Governs preliminary investigations. Specifically Sections 1 and 3.
*   **Rule 110 (Prosecution of Offenses):** Sets requirements for what is required from a complaint in a court of law.
*   **Rule 117 (Motion to Quash):** Explains the process of a Motion to Quash and when one is applicable in a Court of Law
*   ***Cojuangco, Jr. v. PCGG*** (G.R. Nos. 92319-20, October 2, 1990):  Distinguishes this case from *Cojuangco*, where the PCGG was barred from conducting preliminary investigations after already having made a prima facie finding of guilt and issuing a sequestration order. The court argues that the DOJ's actions are different.
*   ***Soriano v. Casanova*** (G.R. No. 163400, March 31, 2006): Allows an affidavit from any competent person to be the basis of criminal action.
*   ***Oporto, Jr. v. Judge Monserate*** (408 Phil. 561 [2001]):Lack of oath is a mere defect.
*    ***Cruz v. Salva*** (105 Phil. 1151 [1959]): Sensured for inexcusably allowing undue publicity in the conduct of preliminary investigation.
*    ***Roberts, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*** (324 Phil. 568 [1996]): Sets that it is not for the court to determine probable cause.
*   ***Ladlad v. Velasco*** (G.R. Nos. 172070-72, June 1, 2007): Relates to instances where the courts found bias based on the Secretary's declarations.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Prejudgment Argument:** The petitioners' argument of prejudgment based on public statements by the DOJ Secretary and the President was rejected. The Court deemed these statements as opinions only, not proof of undue influence on the Investigating Panel. The risk remains that the comments of the President and the Secretary of Justice, while not deemed prejudicial enough to stop the preliminary investigation, may still have undue influence on the public perception and any potential trial related to the case.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court held that the preliminary investigation was not tainted by bias or procedural errors. This case clarifies that the DOJ's power to investigate and conduct preliminary investigations is broad and that the form of the initial complaint for a preliminary investigation is less stringent than for a formal criminal complaint. It underscores the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
