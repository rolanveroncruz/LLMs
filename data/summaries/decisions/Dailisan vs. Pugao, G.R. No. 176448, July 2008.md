## Legal Document Summary: *Dailisan v. Court of Appeals*

**Case:** *Jose S. Dailisan v. Court of Appeals and the Hrs. of Federico Pugao* (G.R. No. 176448, July 28, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC decision, which originally ordered the partition of a parcel of land.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Sale & Agreement:** Dailisan (Petitioner) claims to have purchased a ¼ share of Federico Pugao's land in 1979, evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale. He previously made installment payments towards a ½ share, but Pugao allegedly said he could only sell ¼. A real estate mortgage was executed as security for a P10,000 loan, which was later paid.
*   **Dispute:** Pugao (deceased, now represented by heirs/Respondents) disputes the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale, claiming he signed it under false pretenses (believing it was a mortgage document) due to his limited education and inability to understand English. He also claims Dailisan was merely allowed to occupy the land out of pity.
*   **Procedural History:** Dailisan filed for partition. The RTC ruled in his favor, ordering partition, surrender of documents, and damages. The CA reversed, holding that the action should have been for specific performance, which had prescribed, and that the deed of sale was invalid due to lack of consent and consideration.

**Obligations:**

*   **Dailisan:** Obligated to prove the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale, especially given Pugao's limited education and claim of fraud/mistake.
*   **Pugao/Heirs:** Initially obligated to bring an action for annulment of the Deed of Absolute Sale if challenging its validity on the grounds of mistake/fraud. Now, as defendants, their primary obligation is to rebut the presumption of regularity of the notarized deed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Heirs of Pugao):** The RTC initially found them liable for damages and attorney's fees. These were reversed by the CA, but the Supreme Court reinstated the RTC decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** The CA's primary basis for reversal was prescription of the action for specific performance. The Supreme Court addressed this.
*   **Validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale:** The core issue is the validity of the deed given Pugao's alleged lack of consent, limited education, and claim of fraud. This is a crucial risk for Dailisan.
*   **Collateral Attack:** Dailisan argued that the CA's finding on the validity of the deed was a collateral attack. This point was used by the Supreme Court to reinforce its decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1332, Civil Code:** Applies when one party is unable to read or understand the language of the contract; requires the enforcing party to prove full explanation of the terms.
*   **Art. 1390, Civil Code:** Defines voidable contracts (e.g., lack of capacity or vitiated consent).
*   **Art. 1391, Civil Code:** Sets a 4-year prescriptive period for actions to annul voidable contracts.
*   **Art. 1409 & 1410, Civil Code:** Addresses void/inexistent contracts and their imprescriptibility.
*   **Art. 1498, Civil Code:** Discusses constructive delivery via public instrument.
*   **Pan Pacific Industrial Sales Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Reinforces the presumption of regularity of notarized documents.
*   **Felices v. Colegado:** Defines co-ownership.
*   **Tomas Claudio Memorial College, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** States the right to demand partition does not prescribe.
*   **Balatbat v. Court of Appeals:** Discusses constructive delivery.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Description of the Property:** The phrase "undivided ONE-FOURTH (1/4) portion (50 square meters, more or less, in the particular portion of the lot where the house of the VENDEE now stands)" is contentious. The Supreme Court ruled it was not sufficiently identified; therefore, petitioner was constrained to cause the survey of the property.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court **granted** the petition, **set aside** the CA decision, and **reinstated** the RTC decision. It held that the Deed of Absolute Sale was valid (Respondents failed to overcome the presumption of regularity) and Dailisan's action for partition was proper and did not prescribe. The Court noted that the delivery in law was valid based on Art. 1498 of the Civil Code coupled with Dailisan's occupation of the property. The court ruled Dailisan's objective is to make Federico honor their contract and perform his obligation to deliver a separate title covering the lot he sold to him but which can be done only after the portion is segregated from the rest of Federico's property.
