## Legal Document Summary: People v. Sembrano (G.R. No. 238829)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Concepcion Sembrano y Cruz

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Decision Date:** October 15, 2018

**Subject Matter:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165)

**Holding:**  Accused-Appellant acquitted due to failure of the prosecution to establish the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:**  Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The conviction hinges on proving the elements: identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment.
*   **Chain of Custody Rule (Section 21, RA 9165 IRR/RA 10640):**  Critical for establishing the identity of the *corpus delicti*. Requires immediate marking, physical inventory, and photography after seizure.  Non-compliance is permissible *only* with justifiable grounds and if integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.
*   **Failure to Preserve Identity:**  The prosecution's photographs presented during trial depicted the sachet from the *test-buy* operation (marked "GBB") instead of the sachet allegedly seized during the *buy-bust* operation (marked "RCB").
*   **Inconsistency and Admission:**  SPO1 Badua, the poseur-buyer, admitted to the mistake in the photographs during cross-examination. He failed to convincingly explain the discrepancy.
*   **Burden of Proof on the Prosecution:** The Court emphasizes the prosecution's duty to account for lapses in the chain of custody, regardless of whether the defense raises it. (Citing *People v. Miranda*)

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)
*   Republic Act No. 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165)
*   Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165

**Case Law Cited:**

*   *People v. Miranda* (G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018):  Emphasizes the State's burden to account for chain of custody lapses.
*   Other jurisprudence on Chain of Custody and requirements for a succesful illegal drugs conviction cited in the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancy in Evidence:** The key risk identified is the clear discrepancy between the marked evidence presented in court and the evidence allegedly seized from the accused during the buy-bust operation.
*   **Evidentiary Value Compromised:** The ambiguity surrounding the identity of the seized item weakens the prosecution's case and leads to reasonable doubt.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Ground:**  The prosecution failed to provide a justifiable reason for the non-compliance with the chain of custody rule.
