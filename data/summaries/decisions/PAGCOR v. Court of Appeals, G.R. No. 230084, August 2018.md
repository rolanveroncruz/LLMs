Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. Court of Appeals and Angeline V. Paez*, G.R. No. 230084, August 20, 2018.

**Nature:** Resolution on a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing CA Resolutions that deemed PAGCOR's Petition for Review abandoned. The underlying issue is the CSC's reversal of PAGCOR's dismissal of Angeline Paez.

**Facts:**
*   Angeline V. Paez, a PAGCOR employee, was dismissed for testing positive for methamphetamine.
*   CSC initially upheld the dismissal but reversed itself, reinstating Paez, finding PAGCOR failed to comply with Section 38 of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act) â€“ specifically, failure to notify Paez of the positive screening result before confirmatory testing.
*   PAGCOR filed a Petition for Review with the CA under Rule 43.
*   The CA initially dismissed the petition due to PAGCOR's failure to provide the correct address for Paez/Counsel, resulting in non-service. It reinstated upon Paez's submission to jurisdiction.
*   The CA then deemed the petition abandoned due to PAGCOR's failure to furnish Paez with a copy of the petition (including annexes) as ordered.

**Issue:** Did the CA commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing PAGCOR's Petition for Review?

**Ruling:** No. The Supreme Court (SC) *denied* PAGCOR's Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Rule 43 vs. Rule 65:** The SC held that PAGCOR's petition was a *disguised appeal* (a substitute for a lost remedy of appeal under Rule 45) via certiorari, which is improper. Certiorari is available only where there is no appeal or plain, speedy, and adequate remedy. *Jan-Dec Construction Corp. v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Negligence of Counsel:** The SC reaffirmed the general rule that a client is bound by the acts (even mistakes) of their counsel. *Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*. While exceptions exist (gross negligence depriving the client of due process, outright deprivation of liberty/property, or interests of justice), PAGCOR failed to prove *gross negligence* on the part of its counsel. The reasons provided (heavy workload, water damage) were deemed simple negligence, not gross negligence. *Multi-Trans Agency Phils., Inc. v. Oriental Assurance Corp.*, *Baclaran Marketing Corp. v. Nieva*.
*   **Due Process:** The SC found PAGCOR was not deprived of due process, having had the opportunity to be heard before the CSC and initially before the CA. PAGCOR's failure to comply with the CA's orders (furnishing copies) constituted a waiver of that opportunity.
*   **Section 38, RA 9165:** While not the central issue before the SC, the CSC decision highlights PAGCOR's non-compliance with the procedural requirements of Section 38 of RA 9165 regarding drug testing, specifically the failure to notify the employee of the initial screening results before confirmatory testing.
*   **Technical Rules:**  The court emphasized that invocation of substantial justice is not a substitute for compliance with the Rules of Court, especially where the litigant demonstrates a pattern of disregard for procedure. *Indoyon, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*.

**Obligations:**

*   **PAGCOR's Obligations:** PAGCOR had the obligation to comply with court orders, including providing the correct address for service and furnishing the respondent with copies of pleadings. Failure to do so resulted in dismissal of their case.  Additionally, they were obligated to perfect their appeal within the prescribed period.
*   **Counsel's Obligations:** Counsel had the obligation to diligently prosecute the case, which included keeping the client informed and complying with court orders.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Appeal:** PAGCOR lost its opportunity to appeal the CSC decision reinstating Paez, potentially leading to financial liabilities (back wages, reinstatement).
*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the principle that clients are bound by the negligence of their counsel, except in cases of gross negligence depriving the client of due process. It highlights the importance of diligent monitoring of counsel's actions and compliance with court orders.
*   **Future RA 9165 Compliance:**  PAGCOR needs to ensure strict compliance with Section 38 of RA 9165 in future drug testing procedures to avoid similar challenges to disciplinary actions.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in the definition of "gross negligence" and whether the reasons provided by PAGCOR's counsel *could* have amounted to that standard.  The SC sided against PAGCOR, finding the reasons insufficient.
*   The application of the 'interests of justice' exception to the rule that clients are bound by their attorney's actions, is always open to interpretation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rules 43, 45, and 65**
*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act), Section 38**
*   *Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Jan-Dec Construction Corp. v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Multi-Trans Agency Phils., Inc. v. Oriental Assurance Corp.*
*   *Baclaran Marketing Corp. v. Nieva*
*   *Indoyon, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*
