## Legal Document Summary: *Gradiola v. Deles*, A.C. No. 10267

**Nature:** Disbarment complaint against Atty. Romulo A. Deles for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (Canons 9 & 10, Rules 9.01, 9.02, 10.01, 10.02).

**Complainant:** Helen Gradiola

**Key Allegations:**
*   Atty. Deles abetted unauthorized practice of law by delegating duties to "Atty. Ernesto S. Araneta" (later found to be disbarred and potentially never a legitimate attorney), violating Rule 9.01.
*   Atty. Deles participated in a fraudulent scheme to extract money from Gradiola by fabricating a favorable CA Resolution and simulating a Supreme Court "position paper," violating Rules 10.01 and 10.02 (candor to the court; no falsehoods).
*   "Atty. Araneta" split attorney's fees with Atty. Deles, violating Rule 9.02 regarding fee-splitting with unlicensed individuals.

**Respondent's Defense (via son and pro bono counsel):**
*   Atty. Deles suffered a stroke, rendering him incapacitated and unable to defend himself.  He is in a "vegetative state" and cannot communicate.
*   Atty. Deles was also a victim of "Atty. Araneta's" fraudulent scheme; his signatures on fabricated pleadings were forged.
*   Atty. Deles was not Gradiola's counsel of record.

**IBP Findings:**
*   Investigating Commissioner found Atty. Deles liable and recommended a one-year suspension.
*   The IBP Board of Governors adopted the Commissioner's findings.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**
*   The Court *annulled and set aside* the IBP's decision, *remanding* the case for further investigation.
*   Crucially, the Court found that because of Atty. Deles' incapacitation, he was not adequately represented. The pro bono counsel had no effective communication with him and could not fully represent his interests.
*   The Court emphasized the need for due process, providing Atty. Deles a fair and reasonable opportunity to be heard, citing *Samalio v. Court of Appeals*, 494 Phil. 456, 465-466 (2005).
*   The Court recognized the presumption of innocence of attorneys and the need for clear, convincing evidence in disbarment cases, citing  *Aba v. Atty. De Guzman, Jr.*, 678 Phil. 588, 601 (2011); *Bellosillo v. Board of Governors of the IBP*, 520 Phil. 676, 689 (2006); *Joven v. Atty. Cruz*, 715 Phil. 531, 538 (2013).

**Instructions to the IBP:**
*   Obtain an update on Atty. Deles' health condition.
*   Hold the case in abeyance if his cognitive ability is significantly impaired.
*   Direct Atty. Deles to file an Answer and continue with the proceedings if his condition improves.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canons 9 & 10:** These canons outline the ethical obligations of lawyers, particularly regarding unauthorized practice of law, candor to the court, and integrity.
*   **Due Process:** The Court's decision emphasizes the importance of due process in administrative proceedings, particularly the right to be heard and to present a defense.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**
*   **Disbarment/Suspension:** If found culpable, Atty. Deles faces disciplinary action ranging from suspension to disbarment.  The severity would depend on the extent of his involvement in the alleged fraud.
*   **Criminal Liability:** A separate criminal case for estafa through falsification of public documents is pending against Atty. Deles, potentially leading to imprisonment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**
*   **Extent of Atty. Deles' Knowledge and Involvement:** The crucial issue is whether Atty. Deles knowingly participated in "Atty. Araneta's" fraudulent scheme, or whether he was himself deceived.  His incapacitation complicates determining this.
*   **Validity of the Signatures:** The authenticity of Atty. Deles' signatures on the pleadings is a contested point.
*   **Atty. Araneta's Existence and Disbarment:** "Atty. Araneta's" actual disbarment in A.C. No. 1109, along with whether he was ever authorized to practice law, needs to be clearly established.

**Relevant Case Law:**
*   *Samalio v. Court of Appeals*, 494 Phil. 456, 465-466 (2005) (due process in administrative context)
*   *Aba v. Atty. De Guzman, Jr.*, 678 Phil. 588, 601 (2011) (presumption of innocence)
*   *Bellosillo v. Board of Governors of the IBP*, 520 Phil. 676, 689 (2006) (evidence standard for disbarment)
*   *Joven v. Atty. Cruz*, 715 Phil. 531, 538 (2013) (burden of proof on complainant)
