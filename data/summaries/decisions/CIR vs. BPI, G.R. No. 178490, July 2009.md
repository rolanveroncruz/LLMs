**Case Summary: CIR v. BPI, G.R. No. 178490 (July 7, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the CA decision which reversed the CTA's denial of BPI's claim for refund of 1998 excess income tax.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 76 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997:**  Deals with the final adjustment return of corporations, allowing for either payment of excess tax or refund of excess amount paid.  Crucially, it contains the **irrevocability rule**: "Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for tax refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor."
*   **BPI's Actions:** In its 1998 ITR, BPI indicated a carry-over of its P33,947,101.00 excess tax credit. It then suffered a net loss in 1999. In 2001, it filed for a refund of the 1998 overpayment.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Taxpayer (BPI):** Obligated to clearly elect either a refund or carry-over in the ITR. Bound by the irrevocability rule once an option is chosen.  Bears the burden of proving entitlement to a tax refund or credit.
*   **CIR (Commissioner of Internal Revenue):** Responsible for administering tax laws and processing refund claims.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "for that taxable period" in Section 76:** The CA erroneously construed this to mean that the irrevocability expired after one taxable year. The Supreme Court clarified that it refers to the taxable year when the *excess tax was generated* (in this case, 1998), not that the option to carry over is irrevocable only until the next year.
*   **Application of *BPI-Family Savings Bank, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (386 Phil. 719 (2000)):** The CA incorrectly relied on *BPI-Family*, as that case was decided under the NIRC of 1985 *prior* to the introduction of the irrevocability rule.
*   **Unjust Enrichment Argument:**  BPI argued that denying the refund would unjustly enrich the government.  The Supreme Court rejected this, stating that the amount remains in the taxpayer's account and can be carried over indefinitely.
*   **Ambiguity/Lack of Marking in Subsequent ITRs:**  While BPI marked the carry-over box in its 1998 return, the Court noted the importance of the taxpayer's actions in determining whether the option was explicitly carried out.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Philam Asset Management, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 156637 & 162004 (Dec. 14, 2005):***  This case is central, as it interprets Section 76 and the irrevocability rule. The Supreme Court emphasized that once the carry-over option is chosen, it is irrevocable, even if the taxpayer doesn't actually apply the credit in the succeeding year.
*   ***BPI-Family Savings Bank, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 386 Phil. 719 (2000):*** Distinguished as decided under the prior NIRC, before the irrevocability rule.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. PERF Realty Corporation, G.R. No. 163345 (July 4, 2008):*** This case, along with G.R. No 156637 and 162004, shows failure to signify one's intention in FAR does not mean outright barring of a valid request for a refund, should one still choose this option later on.

**Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, Section 76:** Key provision governing final adjustment returns and the irrevocability rule.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1985, Section 79:** Provisions which laid the foundations to Section 76 of NIRC of 1997.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the CIR's petition, *reversed* the CA's decision, and *reinstated* the CTA's denial of BPI's refund claim. The irrevocability rule barred BPI from claiming a refund after electing to carry over its excess tax credit in its 1998 ITR.
