**Legal Document Summary: *J* Marketing Corporation v. Cesar L. Taran (G.R. No. 163924, June 18, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision which affirmed the NLRC decision ordering the payment of separation pay, rest day pay, and attorney's fees to the respondent.

**Key Issue:** Whether respondent, a voluntarily resigning employee, is entitled to separation pay and rest day pay.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent worked for petitioner as a credit investigator/collector for approximately 12 years.
*   Respondent resigned, citing ill health in a formal letter.
*   Respondent claimed a prior verbal agreement with the OIC Branch Manager (Caludac) promising 100% separation pay and other benefits in exchange for the resignation, which petitioner denied.
*   Respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and holiday differential, later focusing on separation pay based on the alleged agreement.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **DENIED** the petition and **AFFIRMED** the CA decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Separation Pay:** Although the Labor Code does not generally mandate separation pay for voluntary resignation, the Court found that an employer who agrees to pay such benefit as an incident of resignation cannot renege on that commitment.
*   **Rest Day Pay Differential:** NLRC awarded rest day pay for the period February 1990 to February 1993 only. This was upheld as the claim before 1990 had prescribed under Article 291 of the Labor Code.
*   **Verbal Agreement:** The Court deferred to the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA regarding the existence of a verbal agreement between the respondent and Caludac concerning the separation pay.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for separation pay based on the verbal agreement through its Branch Manager.
*   Petitioner is liable for rest day pay for the period within the prescriptive period.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Agency:**  The authority of Caludac, the OIC Branch Manager, to bind the corporation to the verbal agreement is a key issue. The Court considered his control over the respondent's work in pursuing company goals.
*   **Estoppel:**  The company may be estopped from denying the agreement, as the employee relied on the promise of separation pay when making his decision to resign.
*   **Precedent:**  This case creates a risk that verbal promises of benefits to induce resignation may be enforceable, even in the absence of a CBA or company policy, especially if made by someone in authority.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Article 291):** Used for determining the prescriptive period for money claims.
*   **Alfaro v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 140812, August 28, 2001):** Cited for the principle that an employer cannot renege on a promise of separation pay as an incident of resignation.
*   **Hinatuan Mining Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No. 117394, February 21, 1997):** Cited for the general rule that voluntarily resigning employees are not entitled to separation pay.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The enforceability of the verbal agreement, given the lack of written documentation and the argument that the OIC Branch Manager may have lacked the authority to bind the corporation.
*   The extent of reliance placed on the respondent's own testimony and the inference drawn from the memorandum.

**Analysis for Legal Counsel:**

This case hinges on the factual finding of a verbal agreement and the doctrine of estoppel. The key challenge for petitioner on appeal would be challenging the factual findings and arguing that the OIC Branch Manager did not have the authority to bind the corporation, nor can his acts be ratified to legally bind the corporation, thus the verbal agreement is unenforceable under corporate law. The court weighed heavily on the evidence presented by the respondent and made a reasonable deduction with such evidence.
