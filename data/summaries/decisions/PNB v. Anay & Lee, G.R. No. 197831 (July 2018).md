**Case Summary: Philippine National Bank v. Spouses Anay and Spouses Lee, G.R. No. 197831, July 9, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's order to cancel PNB's title (TCT No. T-120269) concerning property previously owned by Spouses Anay and foreclosed by PNB.

**Key Facts:**

*   Spouses Lee obtained a loan from PNB secured by mortgaging their own properties and a parcel of land owned by Spouses Anay via a Special Power of Attorney (SPA).
*   Spouses Anay executed the SPA in favor of Spouses Lee, ostensibly authorizing them to mortgage the property.
*   Spouses Lee defaulted, PNB foreclosed, and consolidated title to include the Spouses Anay's property (TCT No. T-25805 was cancelled and TCT No. T-120269 issued in PNB's name).
*   Spouses Anay sued to annul the SPA, foreclosure, and Sheriff's Certificate of Sale, alleging vitiated consent (old age, illness, lack of understanding, undue influence).
*   RTC ruled the SPA void due to vitiated consent, ordering cancellation of PNB's title insofar as it covered the Spouses Anay's property.  The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Special Power of Attorney (SPA):** Found to be void due to vitiated consent (fraudulent procurement). *Legal Issue: Validity of agency, consent, burden of proof*.
*   **Mortgage:** Ruled invalid concerning the Spouses Anay's property because it was based on a void SPA.
*   **Foreclosure:** Ruled invalid concerning the Spouses Anay's property because it was based on a void mortgage.
*   **Restitution:** PNB sought restitution from Spouses Lee for the value of the excluded property. This was denied due to failure to raise the issue in the RTC and the failure to file a cross-claim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PNB:**  Lost title to the Spouses Anay's property.  Failed to obtain restitution from the Spouses Lee.
*   **Spouses Lee:** While not explicitly ordered to pay restitution, the ruling implicitly holds them liable for the debt, less the value of the Anay property.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Mortgagee in Good Faith" Doctrine:**  PNB argued it was a mortgagee in good faith, but the Court rejected this, citing that the genuineness of the Anay's title was never an issue, only the authority to mortgage. The Court pointed to evidence suggesting PNB's knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the SPA execution through its employee's testimony.  *Risk: Fact-specific determination of good faith. Potentially damaging admission by PNB employee.*
*   **Collateral Attack:** PNB argued the annulment of its title was a collateral attack prohibited by Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 48. The Court rejected this because the title was "irregularly and illegally issued to begin with." *Legal Issue: Direct vs. Collateral Attack on Torrens Title.*
*   **Restitution:** Denial of restitution to PNB from Spouses Lee is problematic. The CA pointed out that the issue was never raised before the RTC. *Risk: Potential malpractice claim against PNB's counsel.*
*   **Heirs of Angel Anay:**  The RTC ordered the reinstatement of TCT No. T-25805 in the name of the Heirs of Angel Anay, but only "provided that the heirs comply with all the legal requirements." *Legal Issue: Compliance with estate settlement procedures required to actually effectuate the title transfer. Possible delays and legal challenges from other heirs.*

**Relevant Case Law and Statutes:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 48 regarding collateral attacks on titles.
*   **Ere√±a v. Querrer-Kauffman, 525 Phil. 381, 403 (2006):** Defines "mortgagee in good faith."
*   **Bank of Commerce v. Spouses San Pablo, Jr., 550 Phil. 805, 821 (2007):** Defines "mortgagee in good faith."
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Poblete, 704 Phil. 610 (2013):** Cites that PNB is not entitled to protection since it is not a mortgagee in good faith.
*   **Lao v. Villones-Lao, 366 Phil. 49 (1999):** SPA secured through vitiated consent is void, and cannot be basis for mortgage contract.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The order to reinstate TCT No. T-25805 in the name of the "Heirs of Angel Anay" contingent on "legal requirements" creates uncertainty regarding the actual implementation of the order.

**Recommendations:**

*   **PNB:** Evaluate pursuing a separate action against the Spouses Lee for the remaining debt, excluding the value of the Anay property.  Assess potential legal malpractice claims related to the failure to file a cross-claim in the original action.
*   **Heirs of Anay:**  Immediately commence estate settlement proceedings to formally transfer title to the property. Anticipate potential challenges from other heirs or creditors.
