## Legal Document Summary: Sta. Monica Industrial and Development Corporation v. DAR

**Case:** *Sta. Monica Industrial and Development Corporation v. The Department of Agrarian Reform*, G.R. No. 164846, June 18, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA Decision dismissing Sta. Monica's petition to annul a DAR Order placing landholdings under CARP.

**Key Issue:** Whether Sta. Monica, a corporation, was denied due process by not receiving direct notice of CARP coverage, despite the landowner (Trinidad) receiving notice and having sold the land to Sta. Monica.

**Holding:** Petition denied. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, ruling that the sale of the land to Sta. Monica was void and a mere ruse to circumvent the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **CARP Coverage (RA 6657):**  The DAR Order placed Asuncion Trinidad's land under Operation Land Transfer (OLT) pursuant to PD 27/EO 228, entitling tenant De Guzman to an Emancipation Patent.
*   **Lack of Clearance (PD 27):**  De Guzman argued that the 1986 sale of the land by Trinidad to Sta. Monica was illegal because it lacked the necessary DAR clearance required under PD 27, the Tenant Emancipation Decree. This decree prohibits the transfer of land covered by it except to tenant-beneficiaries after October 21, 1972.
*   **Due Process:** Sta. Monica argued it was denied due process because it did not receive notice of the CARP coverage proceedings. The court found notice to Trinidad, as original landowner, was sufficient because of the relationship between Trinidad and Sta. Monica.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The Supreme Court pierced the corporate veil of Sta. Monica because:
    *   Trinidad and her family owned 98% of the corporation and were its officers, effectively controlling the company.
    *   Trinidad failed to disclose the sale to Sta. Monica during DAR proceedings.
    *   Continued lease rental payments to Trinidad, not Sta. Monica, after the sale suggested a sham transaction.
*   **Prohibited Transaction (PD 27):** The Court relies heavily on the prohibition under PD 27 (as amended and implemented by DAR Memorandum Circular No. 2-A) against transferring covered land after October 21, 1972, except to the tenant-beneficiary. Cites *Heirs of Batongbacal v. Court of Appeals* as precedent.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Trinidad:**  Obligated to comply with CARP requirements.  Remains the owner of the land for CARP purposes and is bound by the DAR order.
*   **Sta. Monica:**  Cannot assert ownership based on the void sale and is subject to the CARP coverage. The court implies the corporation had a duty to disclose all the information that has to do with the land claim.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Litigation:** Despite the SC decision, Sta. Monica may attempt further legal challenges based on other grounds.
*   **Adverse Precedent:**  The case strengthens the DAR's ability to challenge land transfers designed to evade CARP, which may encourage other tenant farmers to challenge existing land ownership structures.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constructive Notice:** The finding of "constructive notice" to Sta. Monica based on Trinidad's position within the corporation could be challenged if evidence exists that Trinidad actively concealed information from the corporation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Governs CARP implementation.
*   **PD 27 (Tenant Emancipation Decree):**  Prohibits land transfers to non-tenant beneficiaries.
*   **EO 228:**  "Declaring Full Land Ownership to Qualified Farmer Beneficiaries Covered by Presidential Decree No. 27".
*   **DAR Memorandum Circular No. 2-A:** Implements PD 27.
*   **Heirs of Batongbacal v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125063, September 24, 2002:** Similar ruling on the sale of covered agricultural land under P.D. No. 27.
*   **Fortich vs. Corona, et al.:** SC ruling on the finality of judicial orders.
