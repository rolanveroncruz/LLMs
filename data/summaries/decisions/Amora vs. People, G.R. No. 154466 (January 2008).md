## Legal Document Summary: *Climaco Amora v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 154466

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' (CA) conviction of Climaco Amora for Destructive Arson under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1613, specifically Section 2(7). The case revolves around a fire that destroyed Amora's building (residence and bakery) and nearby houses. The prosecution argued Amora intentionally set the fire for insurance proceeds.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Destructive Arson under P.D. 1613, Section 2(7) (burning a building in a populated/congested area). *People v. Omotoy*, 334 Phil. 801 (1997) cited.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Guilt was established based on circumstantial evidence, satisfying the requisites: (1) multiple circumstances exist, (2) inferred facts are proven, and (3) the combination creates moral certainty of guilt, excluding other possibilities. *Gan v. People*, G.R. No. 165884, April 23, 2007 and *People v. Casitas, Jr.*, 445 Phil. 407 (2003) are cited.
*   **Prima Facie Evidence:** Section 6 of P.D. 1613 establishes *prima facie* evidence of arson where property is insured for substantially more than its actual value. This was present in the case.
*   **Motive:** Termination of lease agreement by the property owner, coupled with fire insurance, established motive.
*   **Investigation Report:** Investigators concluded the fire was intentionally set; this was given weight.
*   **Penalty:** Indeterminate penalty was imposed, following the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103 as amended by Act No. 4225). The range was calculated correctly based on the prescribed penalty for Destructive Arson and Article 61 of the Revised Penal Code, resulting in 12 years, 5 months, 11 days to 18 years, 8 months, 1 day of *reclusion temporal*.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Climaco Amora is obligated to serve the sentence imposed by the CA as affirmed.
*   Amora is liable for the criminal act of Destructive Arson.
*   The ruling implies a potential civil liability for damages caused by the fire, though not explicitly addressed in this decision.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction hinges on circumstantial evidence. Defense counsel could argue that the prosecution failed to definitively exclude alternative explanations for the fire.
*   **Reliance on Investigation Report:** The reliance on the fire investigators' report without further scrutiny of the methodology could be challenged. However, the absence of demonstrated ill-motive on the investigator's behalf, makes this challenge less likely to succeed.

**Contention:**
