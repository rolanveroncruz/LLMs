## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dioneda*, G.R. No. 180923

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Salomon Dioneda y Dela Cruz a.k.a. Simon Dioneda Dela Cruz*

**Court:** Supreme Court (Second Division), citing CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 02096 which affirmed RTC Quezon City Branch 107.

**Date:** April 30, 2009

**Holding:** Affirmed the conviction of Salomon Dioneda (aka Simon Dioneda) for rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353) with a *modification* to the damages awarded.

**Facts:**
*   Accused was charged with rape of a 6-year-old child (AAA).
*   The prosecution's version is that the accused, then a minor (17 years old), lured the child into his residence, forced her into a room, and sexually assaulted her.
*   Medical examination confirmed a recent vaginal laceration consistent with penetration.
*   The defense denied the accusation, claiming the accused was watching TV and later falsely accused.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance: Minority:** The accused was 17 years old at the time of the offense, granting him a privileged mitigating circumstance, lowering the penalty.
*   **Credibility of Witness:**  The defense challenged the credibility of the victim (AAA), particularly citing inconsistencies in her testimony.
*   **Hearsay:** Testimony about the child's initial report of the incident to her parents was used to support the prosecution's narrative.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable to pay the victim:
    *   P50,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   P25,000.00 (modified from P50,000) as exemplary damages
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages
*   **Restraining Order:** Prohibited from approaching or contacting the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility issues:** While the court dismissed the defense's arguments regarding inconsistencies in testimony, the case's reliance on a young victim's account introduces inherent challenges and requires careful judicial scrutiny. The consistency of the child's statement, particularly when supported by physical evidence, would be critical for securing conviction.
*   **Age Discrepancy:** The Court acknowledges the discrepancy between the name used by the accused and the one on his birth certificate. A potential challenge, although the court did not address this further in its decision.
