**Case:** *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Romeo Teston* G.R. No. 174966, February 14, 2008 (569 Phil. 137)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Deed of Conditional Sale between DBP (petitioner) and Romeo Teston (respondent) for two parcels of land. Teston defaulted on payments, leading DBP to rescind the contract. Subsequently, the land was transferred to the government under CARP (RA 6657). Teston then filed a petition before the DARAB, arguing that the government, via Land Bank, assumed his obligation to DBP, extinguishing DBP's right to rescind. The DARAB dismissed the petition, which the CA modified, ordering DBP to return Teston's alleged P1,000,000 down payment, plus interest. The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision and reinstated DARAB's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Conditional Sale:** Governs the initial agreement, outlining installment payments and conditions for ownership transfer. The transfer of property is conditioned upon full compliance of the terms of the sale, specifically, payment in full of the purchase price.
*   **Rescission Clause:** DBP rescinded the contract due to Teston's default.
*   **CARP Coverage (RA 6657):** The land's transfer to the government under CARP is a central issue. The CARP law also states under Section 72 that mortgages and other claims registered with the Register of Deeds shall be assumed by the government to an amount equivalent to the landowner’s compensation value.
*   **Article 1385, Civil Code:** Applies to rescission, creating the obligation to return the objects of the contract and the price, plus interests.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Teston:** Initially liable for amortizations under the Deed of Conditional Sale. This liability was extinguished after DBP rescinded the Deed of Conditional Sale.
*   **DBP:** Initially potentially liable for the refund of payments made by Teston upon rescission per Art. 1385 of the Civil Code and CA ruling, but absolved of this liability by the Supreme Court.
*   **Land Bank:** Initially potentially liable to assume Teston's obligations to DBP under CARP, but liability was later extinguished by the DARAB ruling.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Rescission:** The DARAB found the rescission valid because Teston did not question it for five years.
*   **"Other Claims" under RA 6657 Section 72:** Whether Teston's amortization payments fall under this category. DARAB ruled that the other claims alluded to by law refer to payment of amortizations under a contract of sale which have not been extinguished by rescission.
*   **Proof of Down Payment:** The P1,000,000 down payment became contentious as the issue was not raised at the DARAB level, and the documents submitted were mere photocopies not formally offered as evidence, violating Section 3 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court and Section 34 of Rule 132 of the same Rules.
*   **Due Process:** SC held that requiring DBP to return the alleged P1,000,000 without first giving it an opportunity to present evidence would violate the Constitutional provision that “[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law x x x.”

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Governs the land acquisition and distribution process.
*   **Executive Order 407:** Accelerates land acquisition and distribution under CARP.
*   **Article 1385, Civil Code:** Pertains to the obligations arising from rescission.
*   **Section 3 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:** Sets the original document rule which states that when the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document, no evidence shall be admissible other than the original document itself.
*   **Section 34 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Sets the rule on offer of evidence which states that the court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.
*   **Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution:** Guarantees due process.
*   **Jose Clavano, Inc. v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (428 Phil. 208 (2002)):** Judgment must conform to the pleadings and evidence.
*   **Heirs of Ramon Durano, Sr. v. Uy (398 Phil. 125 (2000)):** The Court of Appeals is imbued with sufficient discretion to review matters, not otherwise assigned as errors on appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a complete and just resolution of the case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of down payments as rentals:** DBP argued that the Deed of Conditional Sale stipulated that in case of rescission, all sums of money under the contract (including deposit) shall be considered and treated as rentals for the use of the property. (This clause was not explicitly ruled on by the SC.)
*   **"Other claims" under RA 6657 Section 72:** DARAB ruled that the other claims alluded to by law refer to payment of amortizations under a contract of sale which have not been extinguished by rescission.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, primarily because the down payment issue was not properly raised and proved before the DARAB. The case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules, particularly concerning pleading issues, presenting evidence, and respecting due process. The decision reinforces the principle that courts cannot grant relief beyond the scope of the pleadings and evidence presented. The SC reinstated the DARAB decision in toto, thus finding that respondent is not the owner of the disputed landholdings and has no cause of action against respondents.
