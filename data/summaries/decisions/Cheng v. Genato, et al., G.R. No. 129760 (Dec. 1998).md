**Legal Document Summary: *Ricardo Cheng v. Ramon B. Genato and Ernesto R. Da Jose & Socorro B. Da Jose* (G.R. No. 129760, December 29, 1998)**

**Case Overview:**

This is a petition for review challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling in a dispute over two parcels of land.  The key issue is the validity of competing claims to the land based on two separate contracts to sell.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Ricardo Cheng (Petitioner):** Second buyer, seeking specific performance of his contract to sell with Genato.
*   **Ramon B. Genato (Respondent):** Landowner, initially contracted to sell to Da Jose spouses, then to Cheng.
*   **Ernesto R. Da Jose & Socorro B. Da Jose (Respondents-Intervenors):** First buyers, contracted to sell with Genato prior to Cheng.

**Chronology of Events & Key Provisions:**

1.  **Sept 6, 1989:** Genato enters a *Contract to Sell* with the Da Jose spouses. Purchase price is set at P80/sqm, with an initial down payment of P50,000 and further P950,000 to be paid within 30 days after the Contract is executed. Clause 3 requires satisfactory verification of the title before payment. *Annotated on TCTs T-76.196(M) and T-76.197(M).*
2.  **Oct 4, 1989:** Da Jose spouses are granted a 30-day extension (until November 5th) to verify titles.  Dispute arises whether this extension was conditional on executing new documents within 7 days.
3.  **Oct 13, 1989:** Genato executes an *Affidavit to Annul Contract to Sell*, claiming breach by Da Jose spouses for failure to pay the down payment.  *Not immediately annotated.*
4.  **Oct 24, 1989:** Cheng expresses interest in buying the property, is shown the titles, annotation of the Da Jose spouses’ contract, and the unannotated Affidavit to Annul.
5.  **Oct 24, 1989:** Cheng gives Genato a P50,000 check, evidenced by a handwritten receipt specifying a price of P70/sqm.  Receipt language is crucial, as it's argued whether it's an earnest money or an option fee, and whether it represents partial payment.
6.  **Oct 26, 1989:** Genato, prompted by Cheng, registers the Affidavit to Annul.
7.  **Oct 27, 1989:** Da Jose spouses discover the Affidavit, remind Genato of the extension, and reaffirm their intent to proceed. Genato decides to honor the contract with the Da Jose spouses.
8.  **Oct 30, 1989:** Cheng's lawyer demands compliance from Genato.
9.  **Nov 2, 1989:** Genato sends a refund check to Cheng, which Cheng rejects. Cheng files an *Affidavit of Adverse Claim* on the titles.
10. **Nov 2, 1989:** Da Jose spouses pay the remaining down payment and deliver postdated checks for the balance of the purchase price, which were not encashed due to pending litigation.
11. **Dec 8, 1989:** Cheng files suit for specific performance.

**Court of Appeals Ruling:**

*   Reversed the RTC decision.
*   Held that the Da Jose spouses’ Contract to Sell was **not validly rescinded**. The 30 day extension was still in effect.
*   Genato's Affidavit to Annul was ineffective.
*   Found that Cheng acted in **bad faith** and wrongfully interfered with the Da Jose Spouses' rights.
*   Ordered specific performance in favor of the Da Jose spouses.

**Key Legal Issues & Arguments:**

1.  **Validity of Rescission of Da Jose Contract:** The Court held the Da Jose spouses were not in default because the extension period had not expired.  Further, Genato did not provide adequate notice of rescission, even if Da Jose defaulted.  Reference to *University of the Philippines vs. De Los Angeles* (35 SCRA 102) regarding the requirement of notice.  Applicability of Article 1191 of the Civil Code regarding rescission of reciprocal obligations is debated. The contract was subjected to a suspensive condition, referring to *Javier vs. CA, 183 SCRA 171*.
2.  **Nature of Cheng's Agreement with Genato:**  Whether the receipt constitutes a *Contract to Sell* or a *Conditional Contract of Sale*. The court deemed it was the former due to the admission of Cheng in his pleadings.
3.  **Applicability of Article 1544 (Double Sale):** Court found that the article cannot apply to the case because transfer of ownership or sale has not yet been consummated. The contract to sell is dependeing on the happening of an event. *PRIMUS TEMPORE, PORTIOR JURE (first in time, stronger in right)* principle applied. Da Jose was first to register and had acquired the right in good faith.
4.  **Good Faith:**  Cheng's knowledge of the prior contract and the annotation on the title is crucial.  *Leung Yee vs. F.L. Strong Machinery Co.* (37 Phil. 644) cited regarding the duty of a purchaser to inquire and the effect of knowledge of defects.
5.  **Damages:** Awarded to the Da Jose spouses due to Cheng's bad faith and interference with their contractual relations.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of the Handwritten Receipt:** The language of the receipt issued to Cheng is potentially ambiguous and subject to interpretation.
*   **Good Faith vs. Actual Notice:** Good faith is crucial to the analysis, and Cheng may attempt to argue lack of actual notice or understanding of the prior contract's implications.
*   **Da Jose checks not encashed:**. Their failure to encash the checks could raise questions about their current status and whether it impacts the enforceability of their contract.
*   **Unconditional offer vs Option to purchase**.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1169:** Demand requirement for delay.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1191:** Rescission of reciprocal obligations.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1544:** Double sales.
*   **University of the Philippines vs. De Los Angeles, 35 SCRA 102:** Notice requirement for rescission.
*   **Javier vs. CA, 183 SCRA 171:** suspensive condition on a contract to sell.
*   **Leung Yee vs. F.L. Strong Machinery Co., 37 Phil. 644:** Good faith in real estate purchases and duty to inquire.
*   **Odyssey Park, Inc. vs. CA, 280 SCRA 253; Rillo vs. CA, 274 SCRA 461:** Definition of what is a contract to sell.
*   **Uraca vs. CA, 278 SCRA 702:** *PRIMUS TEMPORE, PORTIOR JURE*
*   **Coronel vs. Court of Appeals, 263 SCRA 15:** Conditional Contract of Sale.
