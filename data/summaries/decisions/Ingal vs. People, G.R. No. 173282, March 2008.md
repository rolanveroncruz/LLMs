## Legal Document Summary - *Ingal v. People*, G.R. No. 173282 (2008)

**Case Summary:** This is a criminal case concerning the conviction of Jose Ingal for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed with modification the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction. Ingal was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the stabbing death of Rolando Domingo.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, qualified by treachery (sudden and unexpected attack).
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Primarily relied on eyewitness testimony of Aida Bona and Rosalinda Tan who identified Ingal as the sole assailant. Their delayed written statements were deemed credible, excused by fear of reprisal.
    *   **Defense:** Ingal raised denial and alibi, supported by witnesses Ricardo de Leon and Remedios Ibajo. However, these witnesses were deemed less credible due to their relationship with Ingal and inconsistencies (e.g., Ibajo's residency). Alibi also failed because Ingal was allegedly nearby.
    *   **Conspiracy:** Although the Information alleged conspiracy with Ricardo Lidot and others, the prosecution failed to prove it. Ingal was convicted as a principal for his direct act of stabbing.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment) due to the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Jose Ingal:** Found guilty of murder and ordered to serve a sentence of reclusion perpetua. Furthermore, is ordered to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and exemplary damages to the victim's heirs.

**Damages Awarded:** The SC modified the CA decision to include the following damages:

*   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000.00
*   **Moral Damages:** P50,000.00
*   **Temperate Damages:** P25,000.00 (in lieu of unproven actual damages)
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P25,000.00 (due to treachery)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility & Delayed Statements:** The defense heavily challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses due to the delay in providing written statements.  The court addressed this by finding that initial reluctance due to fear of reprisal is a valid explanation, citing *People v. Hernandez*, G.R. No. 139697 (2004) and *People v. Roma*, G.R. No. 147996 (2005).
*   **Discrepancies & Inconsistencies:** The defense pointed to discrepancies in the witnesses' testimonies concerning the presence of the accused at the police station and the number of assailants (arguing that inconsistencies undermined credibility). The court ruled that minor inconsistencies strengthened, rather than weakened, the credibility of the witnesses.
*   **Information & Conspiracy:** The fact that the information alleged conspiracy but it was not proven presents a potential for argument regarding variance between the allegations and proof. However, the Court found that even without proving conspiracy, the direct evidence implicating Ingal in the stabbing was sufficient for conviction as a principal. Citing *People v. Peralta*, 134 Phil. 703 (1968).

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Article 8, Revised Penal Code (Conspiracy)
*   Article 64[1], Revised Penal Code (Penalty)
*   Articles 2224, Civil Code (Temperate Damages)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mateo*, G.R. Nos. 147678-87 (2004): Remanding the case to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition.
*   *People v. Hernandez*, G.R. No. 139697 (2004)
*   *People v. Roma*, G.R. No. 147996 (2005)
*    *People v. Peralta*, 134 Phil. 703 (1968): discusses the element of conspiracy.
*   *People v. Tolentino*, G.R. No. L-59097 (1988)
*   *People v. Alviz*, G.R. Nos. 144551-55 (2004): The credibility of defense and prosecuting witness is compared.

**Overall Assessment:**  The SC upheld the conviction based on the positive identification of Ingal by two eyewitnesses. The Court sufficiently addressed the defense's arguments regarding delayed statements and inconsistencies.  Despite the initial allegation of conspiracy, the prosecution successfully proved Ingal's direct participation in the murder, leading to his conviction and the award of damages to the victim's heirs.
