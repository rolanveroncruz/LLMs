**Legal Document Summary: *Tabuada v. Ruiz, G.R. No. 168799, June 27, 2008***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing RTC Order terminating special proceedings (intestate estate settlement).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RTC Order:** Terminated Sp. Proc. No. 5198 based on failure of parties to submit an amicable settlement as per RTC's December 6, 2004 Order, invoking Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court. Also denied all pending motions filed by the parties.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Termination was premature given the lack of debt payment and estate distribution and due to the fact that the parties had already prepared all necessary papers for the amicable settlement.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   The petition is GRANTED. Termination of special proceedings solely for failure to submit an amicable settlement is erroneous.
    *   Special proceedings are non-contentious and should only be dismissed in extreme cases consistent with equity and justice, not as a penalty.
    *   Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court (dismissal for failure to comply with rules or orders) is inapplicable because the RTC's December 6, 2004 Order did not mandate submission of amicable settlement under penalty of dismissal.
    *   An order requiring submission of an amicable settlement does not find support in jurisprudence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   None directly established by this ruling. The key issue is procedural correctness of the lower courtâ€™s actions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Delay in Estate Settlement:** While the ruling reinstates the special proceedings, the delay caused by the erroneous termination prolongs the settlement of the estate.
*   **Further Litigation:** Potential for future disputes among heirs may arise during the continuation of the estate settlement process.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 17, Section 3:** Cited by the RTC as the basis for dismissal, but deemed inapplicable by the Supreme Court.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 1, Section 3(c):** Defines special proceedings, highlighting their non-contentious nature.
*   **Vda. de Manalo v. Court of Appeals, 402 Phil. 152, 165 (2001):** Cited for the definition of Special Proceedings
*   **Dayo v. Dayo , 95 Phil. 703, 707 (1954):** Cited for the principle that the dismissal of special proceedings should be ordered only in the extreme case where the termination of the proceeding is the sole remedy consistent with equity and justice, but not as a penalty for neglect of the parties therein
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Magwin Marketing Corporation, 450 Phil. 720, 738 (2003):** Affirms the strong encouragement of amicable settlements but clarifies that failure to reach one doesn't warrant procedural sanctions.
*   **Goldloop Properties, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 212 SCRA 498, 506 (1992):** Reinforces that failure to consummate an amicable settlement should not lead to case dismissal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's December 6, 2004 Order's wording regarding the submission of an amicable settlement. The Supreme Court emphasized that it did not explicitly require the submission under penalty of dismissal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the RTC's order, emphasizing that special proceedings should not be dismissed merely for failure to submit an amicable settlement. The ruling underscores the non-contentious nature of special proceedings and the court's duty to facilitate a just resolution, not to penalize parties for failing to reach a compromise. The case is remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.
