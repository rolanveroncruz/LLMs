**Case Summary: TSPIC Corporation vs. TSPIC Employees Union (FFW)**

**Citation:** G.R. No. 163419, February 13, 2008 (568 Phil. 774)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision regarding alleged diminution of benefits.

**Key Issue:** Whether TSPIC's deduction of alleged overpayments from employees' salaries constituted a diminution of benefits in violation of Article 100 of the Labor Code.

**Factual Background:**

*   TSPIC and the Union entered into a CBA (2000-2004) with yearly salary increases.
*   Wage Order No. NCR-08 (WO No. 8) increased the minimum wage.
*   Newly regularized employees (second group) received a "regularization increase" per the CBA.
*   The employees who were regularized earlier (first group) ended up earning less than the new hires, and the company decided to deduct from the salaries from all the concerned employees including the newly regularized hires due to system error.

**Key CBA Provisions:**

*   **Article X, Section 1:** Provided for yearly salary increases (10%, 12%, 11% for 2000, 2001, and 2002 respectively) for regular employees.
*   **Article X, Section 2:** Provided for "Regularization Increase" for employees acquiring regular status after the effectivity of a salary increase.
*   **Crediting Provision (Article X, Section 1):** Stipulated that salary increases for 2001 and 2002 were "deemed inclusive" of mandated minimum wage increases under future wage orders after Wage Order No. NCR-07 and would be considered as corrections to wage distortion.

**Voluntary Arbitrator's Decision:** Ruled that TSPIC's deduction violated Art. 100 of the Labor Code (prohibition against diminution of benefits) and ordered payments and attorneyâ€™s fees.

**Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the Voluntary Arbitrator.

**Supreme Court Holding:** Reversed the CA decision finding deductions were NOT diminution of benefits as defined under Labor Code.

**Legal Analysis and Key Points:**

*   **CBA Interpretation:** The Supreme Court held that the "crediting provision" in the CBA was valid and enforceable. The specific provision (crediting) governs over general provision (yearly wage increase).
*   **Application of WO No. 8:** TSPIC correctly credited the 12% salary increase for 2001 against the increase mandated by WO No. 8. This avoided double compensation and aligned with the parties' intent.
*   **Diminution of Benefits (Art. 100 Labor Code):** The Court ruled that the deduction did not constitute a diminution of benefits. The overpayment was due to an error, and erroneously granted benefits can be withdrawn without violating Art. 100. *Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corp. v. NLRC* held that payment made by reason of a mistake in construction or application of a "doubtful or difficult question of law" does not create a vested right nor a diminution of benefits when corrected. The requirements to establish diminution were not fully satisfied.
*   **Wage Distortion:** The proper calculation of the wage is stated in detail in the decision to avoid any distortion between the first and second group of employees.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in CBA:** The CBA's crediting provision could be interpreted differently.
*   **Legal Interest:** Ordered payment of legal interest for any month of delay, which should be calculated to the extent applicable.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review and recalculate the exact amounts owed to each employee based on the formula provided by the Supreme Court.
*   Ensure compliance with attorney's fees award.
*   Modify current CBA to avoid confusion in case of any new wage orders.
