## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Rivera*, G.R. No. 182347

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically selling *shabu*. The RTC and CA both found the accused guilty.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Art. II, R.A. 9165:** Prohibits the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, or transportation of dangerous drugs without legal authorization. Penalties range from life imprisonment to death (now life imprisonment due to R.A. 9346) and fines.
*   **Sec. 21, R.A. 9165 & IRR:** Establishes chain of custody requirements for seized drugs: immediate inventory and photograph in the presence of the accused, media, DOJ representative, and elected official. *Provided*, that non-compliance is justifiable grounds.

**Factual Summary:**

Accused Rivera was convicted based on a buy-bust operation. PO2 Llantino acted as the poseur-buyer, purchasing *shabu* from Rivera for P100. Rivera was arrested, and the *shabu* tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride.

**Accused's Arguments on Appeal:**

1.  **Reliance on Lone Witness:** The conviction relied heavily on PO2 Llantino's testimony, with no corroboration from other buy-bust team members.
2.  **Chain of Custody Violation:** Failure to comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 regarding inventory and photographing immediately after seizure, creating doubt about the evidence's integrity.
3. **Frame Up:** Accused argued that he was a victim of a frame-up.

**Court's Holding:**

Affirmed the conviction.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court found that the prosecution proved all the elements of illegal sale: identity of buyer and seller, object (shabu), consideration (P100), delivery, and payment.
*   **Credibility of Witness:**  The Court gave weight to PO2 Llantino's testimony, finding it credible, positive, and sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The testimony of a single prosecution witness is enough to sustain a conviction.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation Validity:** Upheld the validity of the buy-bust operation as a legitimate form of entrapment.
*   **Chain of Custody Adequacy:**  Acknowledged the failure to strictly comply with Section 21. However, invoking *People v. Del Monte* and the proviso in the IRR, the Court found that the integrity and evidentiary value of the *shabu* were adequately preserved despite the deviation.
*   **Defense Failure:** The defense did not raise this issue during trial.
*   **Chain of Custody Integrity:** Document and object evidence supported finding a valid buy-bust. Accused was brought to the station and the seized evidence was turned over, marked and requested for lab examination.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The Forensic chemist was stipulated as qualified and can identify the specimen.
* **Frame Up:** The frame up allegation lacks evidence and no malicious intent was found with the police officers.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 21:** Chain of Custody Requirements.
*   **R.A. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, reducing the maximum penalty for drug offenses to life imprisonment.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *People v. Del Monte* (G.R. No. 179940, 23 April 2008): Emphasizes that the preservation of integrity and evidentiary value is paramount in drug cases, even if Section 21 is not strictly followed.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Weakness:** The non-compliance with Section 21 presents a continuing risk. The courtâ€™s reliance on *Del Monte* could be challenged if a stronger showing of prejudice or reasonable doubt regarding the evidence's integrity could be made.
*   **Discrepancy on Buy-bust Money:** There was a slight discrepancy in the serial numbers on the buy-bust money, which the court resolved by affirming that "It is enough that the prosecution proved that money was paid to accused-appellant in consideration of which he sold and delivered the shabu."

**Ambiguities:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" for not following Section 21 are not explicitly identified in the decision, creating some uncertainty about future applications of this exception.

**Legal Strategy Notes:**

*   Future appeals could focus on demonstrating specific prejudice resulting from the Section 21 violations, undermining the assertion that the evidence's integrity was preserved.
*   Challenge the credibility of the chain of custody of the drug from the time it was allegedly seized until it was admitted in court as evidence.
