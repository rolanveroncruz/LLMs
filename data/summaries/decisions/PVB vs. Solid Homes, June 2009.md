**Case Summary: Philippine Veterans Bank vs. Solid Homes, Inc. (G.R. No. 170126, June 9, 2009)**

**Nature of the Document:** This is a Supreme Court decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari regarding the execution of a final RTC resolution approving a compromise agreement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Compromise Agreement (April 3, 1992):** Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB) and Solid Homes, Inc. agreed on the repurchase by Solid Homes of PVB's rights in mortgaged properties for P57,875,931.90.
*   **RTC Resolution (February 22, 1994):**  RTC granted Solid Homes' motion for summary judgment, ordering PVB to deliver condominium units equivalent to payments made, and directing Solid Homes to pay the remaining balance in installments with 8% interest per annum. This is the core judgment at issue.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** Solid Homes filed a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution of the February 22, 1994 Resolution, which PVB opposed, arguing the judgment had prescribed.

**Obligations:**

*   **Solid Homes:** Obligated to pay the remaining balance of P28,937,965.95 in six quarterly installments with 8% interest per annum, as clarified in the May 6, 1999 order.
*   **Philippine Veterans Bank:** Obligated to deliver 2,850 square meters of condominium units to Solid Homes.

**Liabilities:**

*   PVB is liable for failure to comply with the RTC Resolution.
*   The Court ultimately found PVB liable, denying their Petition and ruling in favor of Solid Homes, Inc.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prescription:**  The core issue is whether the ten-year period for executing the judgment had prescribed. PVB argued it had. The Supreme Court ruled that one of the PVBâ€™s actions challenging the interest rate *did* toll the prescriptive period.
*   **Interest Rate Discrepancy:**  The altered interest rate (8% vs. 18%) in the RTC records created ambiguity.  The Supreme Court clarified that the correct rate was 8%. This issue was heavily litigated, and PVB was found to have been aware of the correct rate from the beginning, rendering their arguments baseless.
*   **Rule 65 Certiorari & Tolling:** The Court applied the general rule that a petition for certiorari does not interrupt the principal case *unless* an injunction is issued. The exception was G.R. No. 138993 which was seen as an attempt by PVB to modify the judgment on the interest rate.
*   **Strict vs. Liberal Interpretation of Rules of Procedure:** PVB argued for strict adherence to the rules, while Solid Homes argued for liberal interpretation given the circumstances. The court sided with Solid Homes, emphasizing that procedural rules should facilitate justice, not defeat just claims.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court:** Governs execution of judgments by motion or independent action and time limitations (5 years by motion, 10 years by action).
*   **Section 2, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court:** Defines the entry of judgments and final orders.
*   **Section 7, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Relates to Certiorari proceedings, and specifically, that a petition does not interrupt the original case unless a TRO or injunction is in place.
*   **Neypes v. CA:** Referenced concerning calculation of the appeal period, though the February 22, 1994 ruling pre-dates it.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The unilateral rescission of the compromise agreement by PVB. The RTC ruled against it, and the Supreme Court upheld this.
*   The validity of unilateral rescission of the contract. The RTC found that there was nothing in the agreement that authorized a unilateral rescission by PVB.
*   The "altering" of interest rates in the RTC Resolution. It's implied that this alteration had not been authorized by the court.

**Potential Concerns:**

*   PVB's repeated attempts to litigate settled issues raise concerns of vexatious litigation and potential sanctions.
*   The history of this case is a complex web of multiple appeals, and PVB's actions throughout the litigation seems to have a goal of protracting the issue at hand.
