## Legal Document Summary: *Allandale Sportsline, Inc. vs. The Good Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 164521)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC decision in a collection suit.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Allandale Sportsline, Inc. (ASI) obtained a loan from The Good Development Corp. (GDC), evidenced by a Promissory Note co-signed by Melbarose Sasot and others. Interest rate was 26.002% per annum. Default triggered immediate due and payable clause and 2% liquidated penalty.
*   **Deed of Mortgage:** ASI and Melbarose executed a Deed of Mortgage over various chattels (inventory provided). Mortgagee (GDC) had the right to judicial or extrajudicial foreclosure upon default, with attorney's fees (25% of unpaid indebtedness, minimum P500) and liquidated damages (25% of outstanding obligation).
*   **Default and Replevin:** ASI defaulted. GDC filed a Complaint for Replevin and/or Sum of Money with Damages. RTC issued a Writ of Replevin, and subsequently an Alias Writ to seize mortgaged chattels. Some items were recovered.
*   **Auction Sale:** GDC conducted an auction sale of the repossessed chattels and realized P78,750.
*   **RTC Decision:** Ruled in favor of GDC, ordering ASI and Melbarose to pay the full outstanding balance plus interest and liquidated damages. This disregarded the proceeds from the auction sale.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Partially granted the petition, modifying the CA decision.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **ASI and Melbarose:** Originally liable for the loan amount, interest, and potential liquidated damages under the Promissory Note and Deed of Mortgage. Ultimately liable for deficiency amount, legal interest, and liquidated damages (25% of deficiency amount).
*   **GDC:** Obligated to properly account for proceeds from the auction sale and apply them towards the outstanding debt.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Election of Remedies:** GDC pursued replevin and subsequently conducted an auction sale, effectively electing the remedy of extrajudicial foreclosure. The Supreme Court correctly recognized the impropriety of the RTC's judgment to collect the entire debt after GDC had already foreclosed.
*   **Deficiency Claim:** GDC failed to formally plead a claim for a deficiency judgment in their initial complaint or during pre-trial, which is normally required in a separate action as referenced in *PCI Leasing & Finance, Inc. v. Dai*. However, the Supreme Court addressed the deficiency claim, recognizing that a separate action would only entail the presentation of the same evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. v. Icarangal (68 Phil. 287):** Reinforces the principle that a mortgage creditor has alternative, not cumulative, remedies. Foreclosure waives the remedy of collection of the full unpaid loan.
*   **PCI Leasing & Finance, Inc. v. Dai:** Discusses the procedure for claiming a deficiency amount after foreclosure and the concept of Res Judicata.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 60, Section 9 of the Rules of Court:** Dealt with judgment in replevin cases.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Liquidated Damages:** The 25% liquidated damages clause in the Deed of Mortgage was upheld.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court rectified the lower courts' decisions by recognizing that GDC elected the remedy of extrajudicial foreclosure and was therefore not entitled to collect the full loan amount. While GDC initially failed to formally claim a deficiency amount, the Court, in the interest of justice and judicial economy, awarded GDC the deficiency amount based on the evidence presented, as well as 25% of that amount as liquidated damages.

**Advice:**

While the Supreme Court ruled in GDC's favor with respect to the deficiency, careful pleading and trial strategy regarding election of remedies and proving any deficiency amount is crucial in mortgage foreclosure cases.
