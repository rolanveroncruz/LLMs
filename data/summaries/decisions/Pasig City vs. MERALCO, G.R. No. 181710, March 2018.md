**Legal Document Summary: *City of Pasig vs. MERALCO* (G.R. No. 181710)**

**Subject:** Legality of franchise tax imposed by the City of Pasig on MERALCO.

**Key Issue:** Whether the City of Pasig validly imposed a franchise tax on MERALCO for the years 1996-1999 based on Municipal Ordinance No. 25, Section 32, enacted when Pasig was still a municipality.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the City of Pasig's demand for franchise tax payment from MERALCO for 1996-1999 was invalid for lacking legal basis. The tax was imposed under an ordinance enacted when Pasig was a municipality and lacked the power to levy franchise taxes.  The subsequent conversion of Pasig into a city does not retroactively validate the void ordinance.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **LGC Sections 137, 142, and 151:** These sections delineate the taxing powers of provinces, municipalities, and cities, respectively. The LGC reserves the power to levy franchise tax to provinces and cities, but not municipalities.
*   **Municipal Ordinance No. 25, Section 32:** The ordinance enacted by the Municipality of Pasig that purported to impose a franchise tax. Declared void ab initio.
*   **R.A. No. 7829 (Pasig Cityhood Law), Section 45:** This section provides that existing municipal ordinances remain in force after cityhood unless amended. The Court held this does not apply to ordinances that were void from their inception.
*   **Civil Code, Article 5:** Acts executed against mandatory or prohibitory laws are void.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **City of Pasig:** Obligated to refund any franchise taxes collected under the invalid ordinance. Liable for legal costs.
*   **MERALCO:** Not obligated to pay the franchise tax demanded under the challenged ordinance.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **No Ambiguity in RA 7829 Section 45**: The court held that the provision is clear and only valid and legal ordinances will take effect.
*   **Doctrine of Local Autonomy:** While local autonomy is a guiding principle, it cannot validate an ultra vires act. The power to tax has limitations and is subject to legislative control.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The City argued that the ordinance became valid upon conversion to a city. This was rejected, as void ordinances have no legal effect, even after the municipalityâ€™s conversion to a city.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***San Miguel Corporation v. Municipal Council*** **(152 Phil. 30):**  Upheld the principle that the conversion of a municipality into a city does not remove the original infirmity of a void ordinance.
*   ***Arabay, Inc. v. Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Norte*** **(160-A Phil. 132):** Reinforced the principle in *SMC*, even for taxes paid *after* the municipality became a city, provided the underlying ordinance was initially invalid. The Court ordered refunds.
*   ***Demaala v. Commission on Audit, 754 Phil. 28, 42 (2015).*** The court recognized the principle of local fiscal autonomy and its limitations as the tax granted to the local government is strictly construed against the local government unit.
*   ***Ferrer, Jr. v. Bautista, 762 Phil. 233, 263 (2015).*** The local government ordinance must pass the test of constitutionality and consistency with prevailing laws.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Section 45 of R.A. No. 7829 was the primary point of contention. The City argued that it had a curative effect on the existing ordinance. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, finding that Section 45 only applied to valid ordinances existing at the time of the law's approval.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's ruling confirms that a municipality cannot impose a franchise tax under the LGC, and its attempt to do so through an ordinance is void *ab initio*. Cityhood does not validate the ordinance and thus, the City of Pasig had no legal basis to collect franchise taxes from MERALCO based on the Municipal Ordinance No. 25, Section 32, and must refund any taxes previously collected under the ordinance.
