## Legal Document Summary: *Olympio Revaldo v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 170589, April 16, 2009

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Petitioner for violation of Section 68 (now Section 77) of the Revised Forestry Code (PD 705), specifically illegal possession of lumber without legal documents.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner possessed 96.14 board ft. of premium hardwood lumber (Molave, Narra, Bajong, Magkalipay) without legal documentation, violating Section 68 of the Forestry Code.
*   **Warrantless Seizure:** Police officers, acting on a report, went to Petitioner's house and seized lumber in plain view without a search warrant.
*   **Petitioner's Admission:** Petitioner admitted possession and lack of permits, claiming the lumber was for house repair and furniture making.
*   **Defense:** Petitioner claimed the lumber was given by relatives and left over from a job, and sought to present witnesses to that affect.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC convicted; CA affirmed, citing the *malum prohibitum* nature of the offense.
*   **Main Issue on Appeal:** Legality of warrantless search and seizure; proper penalty for the offense.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To possess legally sourced lumber with required documentation.  The Court interprets the Forestry Code such that *mens rea* is not required.
*   **Government's Obligation:**  To prove possession without legal documentation beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Warrantless Search:**  The central contention revolves around the validity of the warrantless search. The court invoked the "plain view" doctrine, potentially opening to challenges regarding the officers' initial justification for being on the property.
*   **Valuation of Lumber:** The original valuation of P1,730.52 was not adequately proven, leading to a re-evaluation of the applicable penalty. This highlights the need for solid evidentiary support when determining penalties based on value.
*   **"Legal Documents" Requirement:** The scope and specificity of "legal documents" under the Forestry Code could be subject to interpretation. What constitutes sufficient documentation should be clearly defined.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Forestry Code (PD 705), Section 68 (now Section 77):** Defines the offense of illegal possession of lumber.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 309 & 310:** Specifies penalties for theft, with Section 68 violations treated as qualified theft.
*   ***People v. Doria***:  Cited for the elements of the "plain view" doctrine.
*   ***People v. Que***: Clarifies the elements of the two offenses under Section 68 of the Forestry Code.  Mere possession, irrespective of the legality of the source, is sufficient for the second offense.
*   ***Bon v. People; Lalican v. Hon. Vergara; Mustang Lumber, Inc. v. CA***:  Cited to support the position that the court had long ago held the crime is *malum prohibitum*.
*   ***Merida v. People***:  Establishes the need for corroboration of the value of the property stolen when determining the penalty.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty due to insufficient evidence of the lumber's value. The case underscores the strict liability nature of illegal possession of lumber under the Forestry Code and the application of the plain view doctrine in warrantless searches. Future challenges may focus on the initial justification for police presence on the property and the definition and validity of the required "legal documents."
