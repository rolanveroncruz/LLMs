## Legal Document Summary: *Narag v. Narag*, A.C. No. 3405

**Nature of Document:** Disciplinary proceeding for disbarment.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Julieta B. Narag (Wife)
*   **Respondent:** Atty. Dominador M. Narag (Husband)

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Narag should be disbarred for gross immorality, specifically abandoning his family to live with a former student (Gina Espita) and fathering children with her.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Violation of Code of Professional Responsibility:** Complainant alleges violations of Rules 1.01 and 7.03 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral conduct; conduct reflecting adversely on fitness to practice law).
*   **Adulterous Relationship:** Respondent allegedly maintained an illicit relationship with Gina Espita, abandoned his family, and had two children with Espita.
*   **Conflicting Statements by Complainant:** Complainant initially filed, then withdrew the complaint (claiming fabrication and jealousy), then re-instituted the complaint alleging threats.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent denies the affair, accuses his wife of emotional instability and abuse, and claims she forced him out of the conjugal home. He counters with numerous complaints filed by his wife.

**Key Evidence:**

*   **Complainant's Witnesses:** Testimony from the alleged paramour's brother (confirming the relationship and children), neighbors, and Respondent's children (expressing resentment).
*   **Love Letters:** Letters from Respondent to Gina Espita expressing affection and acknowledging her children as his own.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Initially filed by the wife claiming she filed the disbarment out of malice
*   **Respondent's Witnesses:** Focused on painting the wife as jealous and violent, but did not refute the adulterous relationship.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Narag's Obligations:** Maintaining good moral character as a continuing qualification for practicing law (Rule 138, Rules of Court). Upholding integrity and dignity of the profession (Canon 7, Code of Professional Responsibility)
*   **Burden of Proof:**  Initially rested on the complainant to establish facts warranting disbarment by clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence. However, the Respondent had a duty to prove his fitness to remain a member of the bar.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Governs admission and disbarment of attorneys.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Canons 1, 6, and 7.
*   **Family Code:** Defines obligations of spouses (Arts. 68 & 220).
*   **Zulueta vs. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 107383, February 20, 1996):** Cited by Respondent regarding admissibility of evidence (though ultimately deemed admissible).
*   **Barrientos vs. Daarol (218 SCRA 30):** Lawyers must be of good moral character and seen to be of good moral character.
*   **Cordova vs. Cordova (179 SCRA 680):** Immoral conduct affecting fitness includes conduct outraging moral standards of community.
*   **Toledo vs. Toledo (7 SCRA 757):** Disbarment for abandonment and cohabitation.
*   **Obusan vs. Obusan (128 SCRA 485):** Disbarment for adultery.
*    **Morcayda v. Naz, 125 SCRA 467:** Respondent's denial that he is the father of the two is a ground for disciplinary sanction
*   **Maligsa vs. Cabanting (AC No. 4539):** Disbarment for misconduct showing lack of moral character.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Accounts:** The complainant's initial withdrawal and subsequent re-instatement of the complaint create potential ambiguity. This raises concerns about the reliability and credibility of her testimony.
*   **Allegations of Abuse:** The Respondent's counter-allegations of spousal abuse by the Complainant, while potentially relevant to explain his actions, are not directly related to the disbarment charges.
*   **The claim that all the love letters and envelopes are inadmissible in evidence as enunciated by the Supreme Court in ‘Cecilia Zulueta vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.’, G.R. No. 107383, February 20, 1996.** This was not the case, there was handwriting proof and also the respondent did not present any evidence that it was not him.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Moral Turpitude:** The court found that Respondent's actions constituted gross immoral conduct.
*   **Disbarment:** Based on the evidence presented and the established jurisprudence, the Supreme Court decided to disbar the Respondant
*   **Reputational Damage:** The disbarment will have significant and irreversible damage to the Respondent's reputation and career.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court DISBARRED Atty. Dominador M. Narag.
