**Legal Document Summary: _Sergio V. Eamiguel v. Edilberto Ho_, A.M. No. 98-1263-P, March 6, 1998**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Edilberto Ho, a Clerk II, for absenteeism, insubordination, misconduct, and non-observance of office directives.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Factual Basis:** The complaint details numerous instances of unauthorized absences (AWOL) from December 1995 to April 1996. Evidence includes logbook entries showing Ho signing in and then leaving, or falsely representing his presence. There were instances of superimposed signatures and memos ignored.
*   **Findings of Fact:** The Investigating Judge found Ho guilty based on documentary and testimonial evidence presented by the complainant. The Judge considered Ho's evidence as insufficient to negate the complaint's evidence.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) agreed with the factual findings of the Judge Aguilos but also noted a prior order (A.M. No. 97-1-15-RTC) dropping Ho from service for AWOL. The OCA recommended dismissal with forfeiture of benefits due to the severity of the proven misconduct.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the OCA's recommendation and DISMISSED Ho from service with forfeiture of all benefits and prejudice to re-employment in government.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent Ho had a duty to maintain regular attendance and perform his duties responsibly and with integrity.
*   All court employees must exemplify integrity, uprightness, and honesty (citing *Apaga v. Ponce*, *Policarpio v. Fortus*, *Tablate v. Tanjuntco-Seechcung*, and *Lloveras v. Sanchez*).

**Liabilities:**

*   Ho was found liable for habitual absenteeism, insubordination (ignoring memos), and dishonesty (falsifying logbook entries).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The summary indicates previous AWOL incidents (A.M. No. 97-1-15-RTC) which led to Ho being dropped from the service. The exact details and relationship between that case and this administrative matter require clarification. It is also unclear if Ho has re-instated into the service prior to these incidents.
*   While the decision is clear in its dismissal order, clarification may be needed regarding the definition and scope of "all benefits" to be forfeited.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   The decision cites several cases (*Apaga v. Ponce*, *Policarpio v. Fortus*, *Tablate v. Tanjuntco-Seechcung*, *Lloveras v. Sanchez*, *Torres v. Tayros*, and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Grecia*) to emphasize the high standard of conduct required of judiciary employees and the consequences of dishonesty and dereliction of duty. The cases show the precedents that the court cited for the penalty imposed.

**Contention and Analysis:**

The primary contention was Ho's denial of the allegations versus Eamiguel's evidence of his absences. This denial was not sustained due to the evidence presented.
