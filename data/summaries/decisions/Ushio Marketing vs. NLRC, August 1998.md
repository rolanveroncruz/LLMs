**Case:** *Ushio Marketing vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Severino Antonio*, G.R. No. 124551, August 28, 1998.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the NLRC's decision finding an employer-employee relationship and illegal dismissal. The Court reinstated the Labor Arbiter's original order dismissing the complaint.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Ushio Marketing (Petitioner) and Severino Antonio (Private Respondent).
*   **Core Argument:** The "control test" is the most crucial factor in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, and it was absent in this case. Ushio did not control the means and methods by which Antonio performed his work.
*   **Facts:** Antonio claimed he was a regular employee (electrician) illegally dismissed. Ushio argued he was a freelance operator. The NLRC sided with Antonio, but he failed to produce substantial evidence.
* Antonio never presented an affidavit, although required.
*   **NLRC Errors:** The NLRC erred in presuming an employer-employee relationship based solely on Antonio's allegations without adequate supporting evidence, especially given Ushio's verified motion and supporting affidavit from a competitor.
*   **Control Test Absence:** Ushio did not provide tools, control working hours, dictate work methods, or exclusively retain Antonio's services. The fact that Antonio was free to work for other shops undermined the employer-employee claim.
*   **Payment Arrangement:** While Ushio collected Antonio's service fees and disbursed them weekly, this was insufficient to prove employment, citing *Besa vs. Trajano* (146 SCRA 501 [1986]).
*   **Procedural Lapse:** The NLRC should not have admitted Antonio's evidence on appeal (affidavits of co-workers Lopez and Pascua), but even if it did, the affidavits did not connect with Antonio's claim.

**Obligations:**

*   No obligations are imposed on Ushio Marketing due to the reversed decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ushio Marketing has no liability for illegal dismissal or backwages to Antonio.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case underscores the importance of clear contractual arrangements with freelance workers to avoid misclassification as employees.
*   The NLRC initially erred by not adhering strictly to procedural rules and presuming an employer-employee relationship. Future employers should ensure proper documentation and processes to prevent similar issues.
*   Reliance on "industry practice" as a defense requires robust evidentiary support to demonstrate widespread acceptance and consistency.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Continental Marble Corporation v. NLRC* (161 SCRA 151, 157 [1988]):  Cited for the principle of the "control test" in determining the employer-employee relationship.
*   *Besa v. Trajano* (146 SCRA 501 [1986]): Compared the situation to shoe shiners working within a shop not being considered employees.
* *Manila Golf Club, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court* (237 SCRA 207 [1994]): The court differentiated it from the current case.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 221 of the Labor Code: Cited regarding the NLRC's ability to use reasonable means to ascertain facts and disregard technicalities.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The payment agreement between Ushio and Antonio was peculiar, raising the question of his employment status.

**Recommendations:**

*   Ushio should review its agreements with freelance operators to ensure clarity and documentation of their independent status.
*   Businesses should be prepared to present evidence to rebut claims of employer-employee relationships, especially regarding the "control test."
