**Legal Document Summary: *Bildner v. Roxas*, A.M. OCA I.P.I. No. 07-108-CA-J**

**Nature:** Resolution of an administrative complaint against Court of Appeals (CA) Justice Vicente Q. Roxas for gross ignorance of the law and obvious impartiality.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Background:** Complaint arises from CA-G.R. SP No. 94038 (*Nieto v. SEC*), involving a dispute over Philippine Holdings Corporation (PHC) stockholders' meeting. PHILCOMSAT, headed by complainant Bildner, owns 81% of PHC. Nieto, hold-over president of PHC, challenged SEC orders calling for a stockholders' meeting.
*   **CA Decision (Roxas, *ponente*):** Granted Nieto's petition, annulling SEC orders and directing the SEC to cease interfering with powers transferred to regular courts.  Justice Roxas ruled SEC orders issued with grave abuse of discretion as they effectively rendered moot any decision that the regular courts may make on the disputed elections.
*   **Complainant's Allegations:**
    *   Gross ignorance for granting Nieto's petition despite a subsequent Motion to Withdraw based on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
    *   Obvious impartiality for disregarding Bildner's motion to set a hearing to determine the authority of Nieto's counsel.
*   **Court's Holding:**  Dismissed the administrative complaint for lack of merit.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The ruling clarifies the discretionary power of the CA in handling motions to withdraw petitions.
*   The SEC is obligated to stay its hand, in this case, from exercising regulatory powers that interfere with adjudicative powers of regular courts.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Discretionary Power in Rule 65:**  The ruling highlights the discretion given to the CA under Sec. 8, Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically regarding the granting or denial of motions to withdraw. The discretion should not be arbitrary and may be questioned when there is abuse of discretion.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The decision hinges on the transfer of jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes from the SEC to regular courts under Sec. 5.2 of Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code). The CA's focus on this issue, even after the MOU, suggests a concern about preserving the regular courts' authority.
*   **Fact-Finding limitations:** The CA is mainly a review court and has the discretion to hear the motion of a party.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code), Sec. 5.2:**  Critical for the jurisdictional shift from SEC to regular courts.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A:** Precursor to RA 8799, outlining the SEC's original jurisdiction.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 65, Sec. 8:** Governs certiorari proceedings and the CA's options (judgment or dismissal).
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 49, Sec. 3:** Governs hearing of motions
*   ***Solar Entertainment v. Court of Appeals*:** Cited by complainant to show that motions to withdraw petitions have been granted in the past and more often so.
*   ***Patli v. Purugganan*:** Cited by complainant to show that motions to withdraw petitions have been granted in the past and more often so.
*   ***San Miguel Corporation v. Sandiganbayan*:** Cites the fact that after an answer has been filed, the plaintiff cannot unilaterally withdraw his complaint or information.
*   ***Santos v. Orlino*:** Administrative complaint, with the end in view of having the judge suspended, or worse, dismissed for any of his act perceived to be irregular or erroneous, can hardly be considered as an appropriate corrective judicial remedy.

**Legal Analysis for Lawyer:**

This resolution reinforces the CA's discretion in managing its docket under Rule 65.  The key takeaway is the CA's paramount concern with jurisdictional integrity.  The administrative complaint failed because Justice Roxas's actions were deemed reasonable in light of the jurisdictional issues involved.  The absence of proven ill motive on Justice Roxas's part was also crucial. In any future similar cases, it is important to prove that Justice Roxas committed actions in bad faith.
