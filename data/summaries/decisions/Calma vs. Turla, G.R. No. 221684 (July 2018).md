## Legal Document Summary: *Calma v. Turla*, G.R. No. 221684 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that annulled and set aside Regional Trial Court (RTC) Orders removing Respondent Turla as Special Administratrix of the estate of Mariano Turla.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of the RTC's removal of Respondent as Special Administratrix based on DNA test results showing she was not maternally related to Rufina de Castro, Mariano's wife, despite Respondent's claim of being Mariano's legitimate daughter.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in removing Respondent based solely on the DNA test result, as it failed to prove Respondent was not Mariano's daughter (the relevant issue).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petition for Letters of Administration (Rule 79, Rules of Court):** Respondent initially filed seeking appointment as administratrix based on her claim as Mariano's sole legal heir.
*   **Appointment of Special Administrator (Rule 81, Rules of Court):** RTC initially appointed Respondent as Special Administratrix. SC reiterated that appointment and removal of special administrators is within the sound discretion of the court but must be based on reason, equity, justice, and legal principles (citing *Co v. Judge Rosario*, 576 Phil. 223 (2008)).
*   **Accounting Obligation:** Respondent had submitted initial accounting. While ordered to submit further inventory and accounting by RTC, this was not required as the decision was under appeal.
*   **DNA Evidence Rule (A.M. No. 06-11-5-SC):** The DNA test result, although obtained, was not properly offered and admitted as evidence under the rules. Section 5 states grant of DNA testing isn't automatic admission of evidence.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential liability of Respondent (Turla) for improper administration** if evidence later surfaces showing impropriety or breach of fiduciary duty *after* proper procedures. The issue of misappropriated rental income was raised but not fully substantiated or litigated, posing a risk of future claims against her if evidence supports it.
*   **Risk of protracted litigation:** The determination of heirship remains unresolved, potentially leading to further disputes regarding estate distribution.
*   **Petitioner's (Calma) standing to challenge:** The SC indirectly questions Petitioner's standing by noting she should have submitted to DNA testing. If Petitioner cannot adequately prove her relationship to Mariano, her challenges may be deemed moot.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rules 79 and 81:** Governing letters of administration and appointment of special administrators, respectively.
*   **A.M. No. 06-11-5-SC, Rule on DNA Evidence:** Defines the admissibility and probative value of DNA evidence. The court relies on this to show that the requirements for DNA evidence to have been considered was not met, which renders the removal of the defendant invalid.
*   ***Co v. Judge Rosario, et al.*, 576 Phil. 223 (2008):** Reaffirms the court's broad discretion in appointing and removing special administrators, but emphasizes it must be exercised judiciously and based on sound legal principles.
*   **Fule v. Court of Appeals, 165 Phil. 785, 800 (1976):** Exercise of discretion must be based on reason, equity, justice and legal principles.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Respondent's Filiation:** The core issue of whether Respondent is Mariano's daughter remains unresolved. The birth certificate naming Mariano as father holds some weight, but is subject to challenge. This is also complicated by the affidavit of adjudication which states that he did not have a daughter.
*   **Purpose of the DNA test:** The court finds that the purpose of the DNA test was not served, and that the RTC incorrectly ordered the incorrect familial links be tested.

**Advice:** Conduct further investigation to definitively establish (or refute) Respondent's filiation with Mariano. If she is not Mariano's daughter, consider renewed efforts to remove her as administratrix, but this time properly introduce DNA or other evidence and pursue proper procedures.
