## Legal Document Summary: Positos v. Chua, G.R. No. 179328

**Case:** *Rizalina P. Positos v. Jacob M. Chua*

**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division

**Date:** December 23, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision that reversed the RTC decision. The CA dismissed without prejudice Chua's unlawful detainer complaint.

**Facts:**

*   Positos occupied a portion of land in Davao City since 1980 as a member of the Sto. Tomas de Villanueva Settlers Association.
*   Chua acquired the land in 1994 from Ansuico, Inc.
*   The Association filed an injunction case against Chua. A compromise agreement was reached, but Positos refused to abide by it.
*   Chua sent Positos a demand letter to vacate, and initiated barangay conciliation under R.A. 7160. Chua sent a representative.
*   No settlement was reached, and Chua filed an unlawful detainer complaint in the MTCC.
*   The MTCC ruled in favor of Chua, ordering Positos to vacate and pay rent, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.
*   Positos appealed to the RTC which affirmed the MTCC decision. The RTC ruled that Chua's representation during conciliation constituted substantial compliance with the Local Government Code.
*   Positos appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed the RTC decision, dismissing Chua's complaint without prejudice for lack of cause of action due to non-compliance with barangay conciliation.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Requires barangay conciliation prior to filing a case in court. **Ambiguity:** The case hinges on the interpretation of "appearance" during conciliation proceedings under R.A. 7160 and whether representation through a representative is sufficient.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** The terms of the agreement between Chua and the Association are relevant background but not directly at issue because Positos was not part of the agreement.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:** The core of the case revolves around whether Chua has a valid cause of action for unlawful detainer.
*   **Possession:** The issue of Positos' dispossession during the appeal adds a layer of complexity, raising questions of fact for another case.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41 Sec. 1:** No appeal can be taken from an order dismissing a case without prejudice.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 2 Sec. 3:** A party may not institute more than one suit for a single cause of action.

**Liabilities:**

*   The MTCC initially imposed liability on Positos for rent, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses, but this was nullified by the dismissal of the complaint.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-compliance with Barangay Conciliation:** Chua's failure to personally appear at the barangay conciliation is a critical legal issue. The CA and SC found that representation through a representative was not enough, rendering the filing of unlawful detainer premature.
*   **Dismissal Without Prejudice:** While the case was dismissed without prejudice, it leaves the door open for Chua to refile the complaint after proper conciliation procedures.
*   **Procedural Error:** The SC noted that the petition for review was an improper remedy for a dismissal without prejudice.
*   **Factual Dispute of Possession:** Positos' claim of dispossession during the appeal presents a factual issue that could lead to a separate legal battle.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation v. Philippine Infrastructures, Inc., G.R. No. 120384:** Used as jurisprudence to confirm that an appeal may not be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice.
*   **Natividad v. Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), 540 SCRA 124, 135:** Used as jurisprudence to show that only questions of law can be raised before the Supreme Court.

**Summary of Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied Positos' petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing Chua's unlawful detainer complaint without prejudice. The dismissal was based on Chua's failure to comply with the mandatory barangay conciliation process under R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code), specifically his failure to appear personally. The SC also found that a petition for review was an improper remedy for an order dismissing a case without prejudice. This holding opens the door for Chua to re-file the case if proper conciliation takes place. This decision primarily addresses a procedural error and doesn't resolve the underlying property dispute.
