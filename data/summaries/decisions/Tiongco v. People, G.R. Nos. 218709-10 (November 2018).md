## Legal Document Summary: *Liberty B. Tiongco v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. Nos. 218709-10)

**Case Overview:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Sandiganbayan's decision finding Liberty B. Tiongco (former Vice President of PCIC) guilty of Usurpation of Official Functions (Art. 177, RPC) and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) due to the unauthorized processing and release of retirement benefits to former PCIC President Benito F. Estacio, Jr.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Usurpation of Official Functions:**
    *   Tiongco, as Acting Senior Vice President, signed Estacio's Request for Clearance and the disbursement voucher/check for his retirement gratuity.
    *   The Sandiganbayan held that this act pertained solely to the President of PCIC, Lamberto R. Barbin, under *Ombudsman Memorandum Circular No. 10 (OMB MC No. 10)*, which grants discretion to the agency head to release retirement benefits when pending cases exist.
    *   Tiongco argued she acted under PCIC's Codified Approving and Signing Authorities (CASA) allowing two Class "A" signatories to act in the President's absence.
    *   The Supreme Court rejected this, noting Barbin's absence was not absolute and the retirement gratuity was not "urgent" considering the outstanding Ombudsman clearance requirement per Board Resolution 2006-012.
    *   The Court considered that she was aware of pending cases against Estacio and did not properly secure any safeguards.

*   **Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019:**
    *   The Sandiganbayan found Tiongco acted with manifest partiality towards Estacio and caused undue injury to the government by unlawfully disbursing funds.
    *   The Court found that there was undue injury to the government caused by the unauthorized disbursement of P1,522,849.48 in public funds and unwarranted benefit, advantage or privilege given to Estacio.
    *   The Court upheld this, finding Tiongco acted with *manifest partiality* (inclination to favor Estacio) and *evident bad faith* (willful disregard of OMB MC No. 10 and PCIC Board directives).
    *   The dismissal of the cases against Estacio after the fact was considered irrelevant because it was raised too late in the proceedings.

**Obligations:**

*   Public officials have a duty to adhere to established procedures and regulations regarding disbursement of public funds.
*   Under OMB MC No. 10, the head of the agency has sole discretion regarding the release of retirement benefits when a retiree has pending cases.

**Liabilities:**

*   Tiongco is held liable for Usurpation of Official Functions and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The penalty includes imprisonment and perpetual disqualification to hold public office.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Circumventing Established Procedures:** Public officials who bypass proper channels and procedures, even under perceived urgency, risk legal consequences, particularly when it involves disbursement of public funds.
*   **Reliance on Delegation Without Clear Authority:** Acting based on perceived or vaguely defined delegated authority is risky, especially when specific directives, like OMB MC No. 10, exist.
*   **Good Faith Defense:**  "Good faith" is not a blanket defense. If circumstances should put a reasonable person on inquiry, it cannot be invoked. *Ruzol v. Sandiganbayan* (709 Phil. 708) emphasizes that good faith must be assessed based on conduct and outward acts, not merely self-serving claims.
*   **Tiongco's argument on voluntariness**: The court did not appreciate the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in Tiongco's favor, and even pointed out that Tiongco failed to file her Memorandum where she should have argued for the consideration of this mitigating circumstance.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Usurpation of Official Functions.
*   **Section 3(e) of RA 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, prohibits causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   ***OMB MC No. 10:*** Provides guidelines on releasing retirement benefits when the retiree has pending cases. This is crucial as it designates authority to the agency head.
*   ***Rivera v. People, 749 Phil. 124 (2014):*** Defines how a public official violates Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019
*   ***People v. Atienza, 688 Phil. 122, 132 (2012):*** Defines manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and gross inexcusable negligence.
*   ***Ruzol v. Sandiganbayan, 709 Phil. 708 (2013):*** Discusses "good faith" as a defense in Usurpation of Official Functions cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of PCIC CASA Section 20.4:** The provision allowing two Class "A" signatories to act in the President's absence was interpreted narrowly. The court deemed that the absence of Barbin was not to the point that he could no longer exercise his discretionary powers.
*   **Definition of "Urgent Matter:**" What constitutes an "urgent matter" that warrants bypassing the President's authority was a point of contention. The court found that the release of retirement benefits was not an urgent matter, because Estacio has not complied with the Board's requirement of an Ombudsman clearance.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Tiongco's conviction, emphasizing the importance of adhering to established procedures, particularly OMB MC No. 10, and refuting the arguments of good faith and proper delegation. The case serves as a cautionary tale against public officials overstepping their authority and prioritizing expediency over compliance.
