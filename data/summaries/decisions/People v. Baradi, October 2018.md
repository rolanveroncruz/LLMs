**Legal Document Summary: People v. Baradi, G.R. No. 238522 (October 1, 2018)**

**Case:** Appeal of a CA Decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Norman Baradi for violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Defines and penalizes the illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs, ensuring the integrity of the evidence. Critical for establishing corpus delicti.  *Note:* Amended by RA 10640, impacting witness requirements.

**Facts:**

*   Buy-bust operation conducted against Baradi on July 11, 2014.
*   Alleged sale of 0.5890 gram of suspected shabu.
*   0.0245 gram of suspected shabu recovered during arrest.
*   Marking, inventory, and photography conducted at the scene.
*   Baradi denies charges, claiming frame-up.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding Baradi's conviction.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Baradi):** Liable for penalties under Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165:
    *   Crim. Case No. 10462 (Illegal Sale): Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
    *   Crim. Case No. 10463 (Illegal Possession): Imprisonment for 12 years and 1 day (minimum) to 14 years and 8 months (maximum), and a fine of P300,000.00.
*   **Law Enforcement (CAID-SOTG):** Obligated to adhere to the chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The SCt found sufficient compliance with the chain of custody, which the defense could have attacked based on the case law regarding the rigorous requirements of Section 21, RA 9165, and any deviations from its strict requirements.  Had there been a break in the chain of custody, the integrity of the corpus delicti would have been in question.
*   **Witness Requirements:** The prosecution must demonstrate compliance with witness requirements for inventory and photography which are "a representative from the media and the [DOJ], and any elected public official". *Note:* Amended by RA 10640, which requires "an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media."
*   **Defense of Frame-Up:** Baradi's defense of denial and frame-up was rejected. Such defenses are often difficult to prove and require substantial corroborating evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to RA 9165 regarding chain of custody witness requirements.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly noted in the decision extract; however, the sufficiency of compliance with Section 21 (Chain of Custody) is a common area of contention in drug cases, especially if there are delays or inconsistencies in the procedures.

**Summary for Litigation Purposes:**

This case reaffirms the importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases. The SCt upheld the conviction despite the defendant's claim of a frame-up, finding sufficient evidence of illegal sale and possession, and adequate compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 as amended by RA 10640 regarding chain of custody. The prosecution successfully established the corpus delicti and demonstrated that the evidence was not tainted. A potential attack on the chain of custody was available, but not successful due to the level of compliance shown in this case.
