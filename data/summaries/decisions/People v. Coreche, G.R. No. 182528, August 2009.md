## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Coreche*, G.R. No. 182528, August 14, 2009 (612 Phil. 1238)

This case concerns the appeal of Marian Coreche from a Court of Appeals decision affirming her conviction for violation of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, involving methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Appellant was charged with selling and possessing shabu based on a buy-bust operation.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Police officers, acting on a tip, conducted a sting operation using marked money. Appellant allegedly received the marked money in exchange for shabu.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The Supreme Court (SC) focused on deficiencies in establishing the chain of custody of the seized drugs, specifically:
    *   **Failure to Mark Immediately:** Testimony failed to establish *when and where* the seized sachets were marked. One officer admitted marking at the police station. This raised doubts about the authenticity of the evidence. Cites *People v. Laxa*, 414 Phil. 156 (2001) and *People v. Casimiro*, 432 Phil. 966 (2002).
    *   **Equivocal Post-Examination Custody:** Stipulation as to the forensic chemist's (Cari√±o) testimony only established *how* the specimens were packaged after testing, not *who* took custody after testing. This created a gap in tracking the evidence.
*   **Defense:** Appellant denied the charges, claiming frame-up and extortion attempt by the police.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The *People* (prosecution) bear the burden of proving the elements of the offenses *beyond a reasonable doubt*, including proving the *corpus delicti*. This includes establishing an unbroken chain of custody.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting testimony** among police officers regarding the timeline of marking the evidence (cf. *Zarraga v. People*, G.R. No. 162064, 14 March 2006).
*   **Unclear whereabouts** of evidence after the chemical analysis. No witness testified directly on the continuous possession of the drugs post-analysis.
*   **Reliance on the presumption of regularity** in performance of official duty without sufficient corroborating evidence, and the SC found this insufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Provisions on inventory and photographing of seized items. While non-compliance is not automatically invalidating, the prosecution must prove "justifiable cause" for the non-compliance.
*   **Rules on Evidence, Rule 131, Section 3:** The presumption of regularity, which is rebuttable and inferior to the constitutional presumption of innocence.
*   **People v. Mapa, G.R. No. 91014, 31 March 1993:** Emphasized the importance of establishing that the substance tested is the same as the one seized.
*   **People v. Dismuke, G.R. No. 108453, 11 July 1994:** Further elaborates that failure to properly identify the drug specimen creates reasonable doubt.
*   **People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832, 15 October 2008:** Defines "marking" and discusses chain of custody in relation to seized drugs.
*   **Zarraga v. People, G.R. No. 162064, 14 March 2006:** Highlighted the dangers of inconsistencies in officer testimony regarding marking and chain of custody.

**Court Ruling & Implications:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, *acquitting* the appellant due to *reasonable doubt* arising from the broken chain of custody.
*   This case emphasizes the importance of meticulous adherence to chain of custody procedures in drug cases and the potential for acquittal where such procedures are compromised. Prosecution cannot solely rely on the presumption of regularity and must clearly demonstrate the integrity of the evidence. Failure to immediately mark seized drugs and document their handling can be fatal to the prosecution's case.
