## Legal Document Summary: People v. Tanglao (G.R. No. 219963)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Ricardo Tanglao y Egana

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Citation:** 833 Phil. 253

**Date:** June 13, 2018

**Summary:**

This case is an appeal by Ricardo Tanglao from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming his conviction by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for rape under Art. 266-A, par. 1(d) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353. The accused was found guilty of raping his seven-year-old daughter, AAA.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Art. 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of R.A. No. 8353 (Rape involving a victim under 12 years of age).
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (without eligibility for parole due to R.A. No. 9346)
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   P100,000.00 Civil Indemnity
    *   P100,000.00 Moral Damages
    *   P100,000.00 Exemplary Damages
    *   6% interest per annum on all damages from finality of the decision until full payment.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused-appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and to pay the specified damages to the victim.

**Basis for Conviction:**

*   AAA's credible testimony and positive identification of her father as the perpetrator.
*   Corroborating testimony from AAA's older brother, DDD, who witnessed parts of the incident.
*   Medical evidence from Dr. Baluyot indicating "penetrating trauma" and psychiatric evaluation from Dr. Leynes supporting sexual abuse.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused-appellant is liable for the crime of rape based on the proven elements of Art. 266-A of R.A. No. 8353, specifically the age of the victim and the act of carnal knowledge.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Challenge to Credibility of Witness:** The defense attempted to challenge the credibility of AAA's testimony by highlighting alleged inconsistencies (prior NBI complaint against the mother). The Court ruled that prior NBI complaint regarding abuse by the mother, did not negate rape by the father on a different occasion.
*   **Lack of Physical Injury:** The defense pointed to a lack of extensive physical injuries as evidence that rape did not occur. The Court cited established jurisprudence stating that hymenal laceration is not an element of rape and penetration, even without injury, is sufficient.
*   **Parole Eligibility:**  The death penalty was reduced to Reclusion Perpetua without parole eligibility, and the accused might try to question this by challenging its constitutionality.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law):** Defines the crime of rape and its penalties.
*   **Art. 266-A of R.A. No. 8353:** Specifies the circumstances under which rape is committed.
*   **R.A. No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines, resulting in the imposition of *reclusion perpetua* without parole.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Used as precedent for determining the proper award of damages in criminal cases.
*   **People v. Rubillar, G.R. No. 224631, 23 August 2017:** Reiterating that prosecution cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense.
*   **People v. Aycardo, G.R. No. 218114, 5 June 2017:**  That "[p]roof of hymenal laceration is not an element of rape. An intact hymen does not negate a finding that the victim was raped. Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even without laceration of the hymen, is enough to constitute rape, and even the briefest of contact is deemed rape."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None that can be easily identified at this moment.

**Legal Analysis (For the Lawyer):**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings of fact and credibility assessments, which is difficult to overturn on appeal unless there is a clear showing of grave error. The Court relied heavily on the victim's testimony and corroborating evidence.  The absence of demonstrable physical injury, which the defense highlighted, was persuasively refuted by existing jurisprudence.  Any further appeal would have to focus on demonstrating that the lower courts committed a grave error of law or misappreciated specific facts, given the already established facts of the case. A possible point of contention could be the lack of parole eligibility; however, the law on this is settled.
