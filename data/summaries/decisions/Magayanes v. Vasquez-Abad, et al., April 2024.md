**Issues and Rulings:**

*   **A.M. No. MTJ-23-014 (Gross Ignorance of Law – Judge Abad):** Judge Alamada charged Judge Abad with gross ignorance for dismissing criminal cases *motu proprio* before raffle, while acting as Executive Judge. The Court *admonished* Judge Abad, modifying the JIB recommendation of reprimand, citing her good faith belief that it was permitted due to COVID-19 related directives and that she rectified it by recalling her dismissal orders upon clarification. *Potential Risk: Continued misinterpretations of SC directives could lead to more severe sanctions.*

    *   **Relevant Law/Rules:** Rule on Summary Procedure; Administrative Matter No. 05-08-26-SC; A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC (Duties of Executive Judges); *Crespo v. Mogul* (235 Phil. 465). OCA Circular No. 94-2020 (Raffle of cases)
*   **A.M. No. MTJ-23-015 (Dishonesty, Misconduct – Judge Alamada):** Judge Abad accused Judge Alamada of dishonesty and misconduct regarding a job order (JO) employee, Eraga, who allegedly continued to receive compensation after he stopped working for her court. The Court *found Judge Alamada guilty* of *Falsification of Official Documents, Serious Dishonesty, Gross Misconduct, Commission of Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude, and Violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct* for signing payroll registers certifying Eraga's service when he was no longer employed. She also appropriated Eraga's salaries. *Penalty: Dismissal, forfeiture of benefits (except accrued leave), and disqualification from public office, including GOCCs.*

    *   **Relevant Law/Rules:** Revised Rules of Court, Rule 140; Code of Judicial Conduct; *Villordon v. Avila* (692 Phil. 388); *Banzuela-Didulo v. Santizo* (A.M. No. P-22-063, February 7, 2023); *Samson v. Caballero* (612 Phil. 737). CSC Memorandum Circular No. 13 (2021) (Dishonesty). A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC (Penalties for offenses). Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability.
    *   **Relevant Facts:** Payroll registers signed by Judge Alamada, testimony of Agoncillo that Judge Alamada would give her Eraga's ATM.
    *   **Obligations Breached:** Duty to maintain integrity of the judiciary; avoid impropriety; accurately certify official documents.
    *   **Liability:** Administrative dismissal; potential criminal liability (falsification, theft/malversation).

    *The court also found her guilty as a member of the Philippine Bar, and disbarred her.*
*   **MTJ-24-026 (Conduct Unbecoming – Judge Alamada):** Judge Abad and Judge Sakkam accused Judge Alamada of demeaning conduct during raffle proceedings. The Court *dismissed* the complaint for insufficiency of evidence, specifically a lack of corroborating evidence for the Clerk of Court allegedly affected.

    *   **Potential Risk:** Further incidents of discourteous behavior could result in future administrative action. *The Court reminded all judges to be more circumspect.*
*   **MTJ-24-027 (Gross Ignorance of Law – Judge Sakkam & Abad):** Judge Alamada accused Judge Sakkam and Judge Abad of gross ignorance for violating Circular No. 1-90 (Notarial powers of MTC judges) when Judge Sakkam notarized Judge Abad’s complaint against Judge Alamada. The Court *dismissed* the complaint, holding that Judge Sakkam acted within his authority as a judge performing duties related to disciplinary matters. *Circular 1-90 and Canon 2, Section 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct cited.*
*   **Findings regarding Worwor-Miguel and De Jesus**: They are found GUILTY of Falsification of Official Documents and Serious Dishonesty.

*   **Criminal Charges**: The JIB is ordered to file criminal charges against Judge Alamada.

**Key Provisions and Observations:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** In administrative proceedings, the standard of proof is "substantial evidence."
*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** Reliance on interpretations of circulars may mitigate penalties, but not eliminate liability if those interpretations are objectively incorrect.
*   **Impact of Covid-19:** The court considered the pandemic environment when evaluating the charges against Judge Abad.
*   **Moral Turpitude:** The misappropriation of funds, especially when coupled with false certifications, can constitute moral turpitude.
*   **Duties of Judges:** Maintaining integrity, avoiding impropriety, upholding the law, and being courteous to colleagues and staff.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility**: Members of the Bar are expected to act with honesty and integrity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*The decision highlights conflicting interpretations of Administrative Circulars. The "as far as practicable" phrasing used in OCAs guidance on how to conduct raffles should be scrutinized because it is not clear what circumstances qualify its non-compliance.*
