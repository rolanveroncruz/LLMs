## Legal Document Summary: *Team Sual Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (G.R. Nos. 201225-26, 201132, 201133)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc's decision modifying the CTA Special First Division's Amended Decision, partially granting Team Sual Corporation's (TSC) claim for VAT refund.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CTA has jurisdiction over TSC's judicial claims for refund of unutilized input VAT for taxable year 2001, considering the mandatory 120+30-day waiting period under Section 112 of the NIRC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* both petitions, affirming the CTA En Banc's decision. The CTA only had jurisdiction over the second judicial claim because of the mandatory waiting period.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 112(A) and (C) of the NIRC:** Governs the procedure for claiming VAT refunds, requiring an administrative claim with the BIR and adherence to the 120+30-day waiting period before filing a judicial claim with the CTA.
*   **120-day Period (NIRC Sec. 112(C)):** Commissioner has 120 days from submission of complete documents to act on the administrative claim. Failure to act is considered a denial.
*   **30-day Period (NIRC Sec. 112(C)):** Taxpayer has 30 days from receipt of denial (or after expiration of 120-day period without action) to appeal to the CTA.
*   **Two-Year Prescriptive Period (NIRC Sec. 112(A)):** The administrative claim for refund must be filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the sales were made.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Premature Filing:** Filing a judicial claim before the expiration of the 120-day period *divests* the CTA of jurisdiction (violates exhaustion of administrative remedies).  *Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. San Roque Power Corporation, Harte-Hanks Philippines, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* establish this principle.
*   **Strict Compliance:** Tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer.  Failure to adhere to statutory requirements is fatal to the claim.
*   **Factual Substantiation:** The taxpayer bears the burden of proving entitlement to a refund with adequate documentation.  The CTA's factual findings, if supported by substantial evidence, are generally upheld.
*   **Retroactivity:** The court explicitly rejected TSC's argument that it relied on prior jurisprudence holding the 120 day period as permissive. This can effect similar future claims of tax payers.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, Section 112:** Primary statutory basis for VAT refund claims.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Aichi Forging Company of Asia*** **(646 Phil. 710 (2010)):** A key case concerning the 120+30 day rule.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. San Roque Power Corporation*** **(703 Phil. 311 (2013)):** Established the mandatory nature of the 120-day waiting period for exhausting administrative remedies.
*   ***Harte-Hanks Philippines, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue***: Further reiterated the effects of the 120-day waiting period.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Arguments:**

*   **Retroactivity of Jurisprudence:** TSC argued that it relied on previous case law that treated the 120-day period as permissive rather than mandatory. This argument was rejected because the cases cited by TSC were factually distinct and did not explicitly rule on the nature of the 120-day waiting period.
*   **Waiver of Non-Compliance:** TSC contended that the CIR waived the issue of non-compliance with the 120-day period by not raising it at the earliest opportunity. The Court refuted this, noting that the issue was raised in the CIR's motion for partial reconsideration. Importantly, even if the CIR had failed to raise the issue earlier, the jurisdictional defect stemming from non-compliance with the mandatory period could not be waived. A prematurely filed judicial claim is void *ab initio.*
*   **Arguments Concerning Jurisdiction:** The main dispute centered on whether the filing of the petition before the expiration of the 120-day period deprived the CTA of jurisdiction to hear the case. The court decided that it did.

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the importance of strictly adhering to the procedural requirements for claiming VAT refunds, particularly the mandatory 120+30-day waiting period. Failure to comply with this period renders a judicial claim premature and deprives the CTA of jurisdiction, regardless of any perceived leniency in prior jurisprudence or alleged waiver by the CIR. The favorable ruling for the taxpayer was sustained only for the VAT claims that were not prematurely filed.
