**Legal Document Summary: Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation v. Spouses Acuña**

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 162074, July 13, 2009 (610 Phil. 92)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Cecilleville Realty and Service Corporation (Cecilleville)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Tito and Ofelia Acuña (Acuña Spouses)

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Loan & Mortgage:** Acuña Spouses obtained a loan from Prudential Bank secured by a real estate mortgage on Cecilleville's property, with Cecilleville's consent (initially through a falsified secretary's certificate). The loan defaulted.
*   **Forgery:** Initially there were allegations that Ofelia Acuña forged a secretary certificate
*   **Ratification:** Cecilleville initially attempted to annul the mortgage, but the Court held that Cecilleville ratified the real estate mortgage contract. (See *CA-G.R. CV No. 35452, affirmed in G.R. No. 109488*).
*   **Payment by Cecilleville:** To prevent foreclosure, Cecilleville paid Prudential P3,367,474.42.
*   **Reimbursement Demands:** Cecilleville demanded reimbursement from the Acuña Spouses, who refused to pay.
*   **Action for Reimbursement:** Cecilleville filed a complaint for reimbursement on June 20, 1996.

**Legal Issues:**

1.  **Prescription:** Whether Cecilleville's claim for reimbursement is barred by prescription.
2.  **Basis of Claim:** Whether the claim is based on fraud (4-year prescription) or quasi-contract/legal subrogation (10-year prescription).
3.  **Legal Subrogation:** Whether Cecilleville was legally subrogated to Prudential's rights upon payment of the Acuña Spouses' debt.
4.  **Res Judicata:** Whether the prior ruling regarding the validity of the mortgage ( *CA-G.R. CV No. 35452*) bars the current claim.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, finding in favor of Cecilleville.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Legal Subrogation:** The Court held that Cecilleville, as an interested third party, was legally subrogated to the rights of Prudential upon paying the Acuña Spouses' debt. (Art. 1302(3) Civil Code).
*   **Cause of Action:** Cecilleville's cause of action is one *created by law*, prescribing in **ten years** per Article 1144 of the Civil Code, not the four years for fraud. The claim accrued upon payment to Prudential.
*   **Prescription (Analysis):** The payment date was April 5, 1994, the lawsuit was filed June 20, 1996. Demand was made April 9 and April 23 of 1996. Even from payment date or demands the case was not prescribed.
*   **Debt of spouses:** Art. 1236 of the Civil Code states that the spouses owe the debt even if not in the knowledge of the debtor to an extent it benefitted them
*   **Damages:** The Court awarded Cecilleville P3,367,474.42 (amount paid to Prudential) plus 16% interest per annum from April 9, 1996 (date of first written demand), plus 5% attorney's fees.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Acuña Spouses' Obligation:** The Acuña Spouses are obligated to reimburse Cecilleville for the amount paid to Prudential, with interest and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Amended Decision focused on Cecilleville's knowledge of the alleged forgery, this misapprehended the legal basis of the claim. The court ultimately ruled against Cecilleville because it focused on the 4 year prescription instead of the ten year.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1144, 1146, 1236, 1302(3).
*   **Philippine Blooming Mills, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 459 Phil. 875 (2003)**: Attorney's Fees

**Conclusion:**

Cecilleville prevailed because it was subrogated to the bank's rights. The cause of action was based on quasi-contract, not fraud, and the claim was timely filed within the ten-year prescriptive period.
