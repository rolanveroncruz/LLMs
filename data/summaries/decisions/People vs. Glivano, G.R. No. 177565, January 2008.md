**Case Summary: *People v. Glivano*, G.R. No. 177565, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 644)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a conviction of fifty (50) counts of qualified rape.

**Facts:** The Appellant, Elmer Glivano, was convicted of repeatedly raping his 7-year-old stepdaughter over a four-year period (1995-1999). The acts were committed at the family residence when the victim's mother was absent or siblings were asleep. The victim eventually disclosed the abuse in a letter to her mother. Medical examination revealed healed hymenal lacerations. The accused interposed denial and alibi. The mother initially disbelieved the child but later sought assistance, then recanted to protect the family.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Qualified Rape:** Violations of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659 (for acts from 1995 to October 1997) and Articles 266-A and 266-B of the RPC as introduced by R.A. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997) (for acts from November 1997 to November 1999). The case hinges on proving the elements of rape.
*   **Credibility of Victim's Testimony:** The Court reiterated the principle that conviction can be based solely on the victim's credible testimony. The RTC and CA found the victim's testimony credible, consistent, and truthful despite some details being imprecise due to the victim's young age and trauma. *See People v. Pascua, 462 Phil. 245, 253-254 (2003).*
*   **Defenses of Denial and Alibi:** The Court dismissed the Appellant's defenses as weak and easily fabricated. *See People v. Alvarez, 461 Phil. 188, 200 (2003).* The Appellant failed to prove it was physically impossible for him to commit the crimes.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The Court addressed the delay in reporting, citing jurisprudence that delay alone is not indicative of fabrication if reasonably explained, especially in rape cases due to the victim's shame and fear. *See People v. Baway, 402 Phil. 872, 892 (2001).*

**Obligations:**

*   The Appellant had a legal and moral duty not to harm or abuse his stepdaughter.
*   The mother had a parental duty to protect her child. Her initial disbelief and later attempt to withdraw the charges raise ethical and potentially legal issues (e.g., obstruction of justice, depending on her actions).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The Appellant was found guilty of 50 counts of qualified rape. The original death sentence was modified to reclusi√≥n perpetua without eligibility for parole due to R.A. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).
*   **Civil Liability:** The Appellant was ordered to pay civil indemnity (P75,000.00), moral damages (P75,000.00), and exemplary damages (P25,000.00) for each count of rape. The moral damages were increased in line with jurisprudence. *See People v. Audine, G.R. No. 168649, December 6, 2006, 510 SCRA 531, 553.*

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Mother's Testimony:** While the mother's testimony was ultimately unconvincing as exculpatory evidence for the accused, inconsistencies or questions regarding her knowledge of the abuse may be subjects for further investigation.
*   **Number of Rapes:** The precise number of rapes (50) appears based on an estimate. If evidence later surfaces suggesting a different number, it could theoretically affect the sentencing, although the overall culpability remains.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 335 (as amended by R.A. 7659) and Articles 266-A and 266-B (as introduced by R.A. 8353) (rape)
*   Republic Act No. 9346 ("An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines")
