Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Ronnel Buenafe Bercadez* (G.R. No. 265123, July 29, 2024)

**Subject Matter:** Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision which reinstated the MeTC's grant of a Motion to Quash an Information for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 6 (B.P. Blg. 6).

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the CA's decision.  The Information against Bercadez was properly quashed because it failed to allege all the essential elements of the crime of violating Presidential Decree No. 9 (P.D. No. 9), as amended by B.P. Blg. 6. Specifically, it lacked the element that the carrying of the weapon was "in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection, lawless violence, criminality, chaos, or public disorder."

**Relevant Statutory Provisions:**

*   **P.D. No. 9, paragraph 3:**  Makes it unlawful to carry certain bladed or pointed weapons outside of one's residence, except when used as necessary tools for livelihood.  Originally, it carried a heavier penalty and was tied to suppressing subversion and public disorder related to martial law.

*   **B.P. Blg. 6, Section 1:** Amends Paragraph 3 of P.D. No. 9. Reduces the penalty for illegal possession of bladed weapons. It changes the enumerated weapons and provides the added exception "or in pursuit of a lawful activity".

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Sec. 6:** Information must state the designation of offense given by the statute.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Sec. 14:** Addresses the amendment or substitution of a complaint or information.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 117, Sec. 1 and 4:** Discusses motion to quash the Information and amendments of the information.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   The core issue is whether B.P. Blg. 6 eliminated the need to prove a connection to subversion, rebellion, or public disorder to sustain a conviction for carrying a prohibited weapon. The Court held it did *not*. B.P. Blg. 6 is merely amendatory and must be read in conjunction with P.D. No. 9.
*   An Information charging a violation of P.D. No. 9, as amended by B.P. Blg. 6, *must* allege that the carrying of the weapon was in furtherance of, or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, etc.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Judge Purisima (176 Phil. 186 (1978)):** Establishes that P.D. No. 9 requires two elements: (1) carrying a prohibited weapon outside the residence (not for livelihood) and (2) that this carrying was in furtherance of, or to abet, etc., subversion, rebellion, public disorder.  This element provides the "motivation" to make the act criminal.
*   **People v. Lasanas (236 Phil. 27 (1987)):** Reaffirms Purisima even *after* the enactment of B.P. Blg. 6.  It noted that B.P. Blg. 6 *may* have sought to undo Purisima, but the Court applied Purisima.
*   **Comendador v. De Villa (277 Phil. 106 (1991):** Doctrines on cessation of law, which Bercadez tried to evoke to argue that PD 9 should cease applicability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity Regarding Legislative Intent:** The decision acknowledges that B.P. Blg. 6 *might* have been intended to remove the "subversion/public disorder" element. This implies some uncertainty in interpreting legislative intent. The Court relies on a strict interpretation of B.P. Blg. 6 as merely amendatory, without explicitly examining whether the law should be interpreted based on its apparent intent.

*   **Prescription:**  While the Court allows the prosecution to file a new Information, it emphasizes that this is subject to the rules on prescription.  This raises the risk that the crime may now be time-barred.

*   **Constitutionality of PD 9:** While not directly ruled upon in this case, a concurring opinion mentions the potential issue of the constitutionality of P.D. No. 9 in the present context of Philippine law, considering that it was enacted during Martial Law to aid its proclamation and that the spirit behind its existence is no longer present.

**Liabilities:**

*   The original Information exposed Bercadez to criminal liability under P.D. No. 9, as amended by B.P. Blg. 6. However, because the Information was defective, Bercadez's potential liability was temporarily halted, though he may still be charged. The prosecution may face liability for malicious prosecution if they continue the claim.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court upheld the quashal of an Information against Bercadez for violating P.D. No. 9, as amended by B.P. Blg. 6, because the Information failed to allege that his carrying of a bladed weapon was connected to subversion or public disorder, an essential element per *People v. Purisima*. While B.P. Blg. 6 lowered the penalty, it did not remove that element. The prosecution may re-file a corrected Information, but prescription may be an issue. Note the potential, unaddressed constitutional issues raised in Justice Leonen's concurrence regarding the continuing applicability of P.D. No. 9 given the end of martial law. You should advise your client to prepare for the prosecution to file the correct Information should the opportunity arise.
