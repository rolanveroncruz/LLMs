## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Spouses Royeca

**Case:** *Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) vs. Spouses Reynaldo and Victoria Royeca, G.R. No. 176664, July 21, 2008*

**Nature:** Petition for Review of CA decision dismissing BPI's complaint for replevin and damages, and granting respondents' counterclaim.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Royeca (Respondents) executed a Promissory Note and Chattel Mortgage in favor of Toyota Shaw, Inc. for a vehicle.
*   Toyota assigned the Promissory Note and Chattel Mortgage to Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC).
*   FEBTC claimed respondents defaulted on 4 monthly installments.
*   FEBTC filed a Replevin and Damages suit, later substituted by BPI due to merger.
*   Respondents claim payment via 8 postdated checks to FEBTC.
*   BPI admits receiving checks but alleges two were dishonored, and remaining un-deposited due to dishonor, leaving a balance of P48,084.00
*   MeTC dismissed case, awarding damages to respondents.
*   RTC reversed, ordering payment by respondents.
*   CA reversed RTC, reinstating MeTC decision.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Note:** Obligation to pay P577,008.00 in 48 monthly installments of P12,021.00, maturity date of August 18, 1997, penalty of 3% per month for unpaid installments.
*   **Chattel Mortgage:** Security for the Promissory Note, granting creditor (initially Toyota, then FEBTC, then BPI) the right to repossess the vehicle upon default.
*   **Deed of Assignment:** Transferred all rights, title, and interest in the Chattel Mortgage from Toyota to FEBTC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:**  BPI claims Respondents are liable for P48,084.00 (4 unpaid installments) plus 36% per annum interest from May 18, 1997, attorney's fees, liquidated damages, and other expenses. Court changed this to 12% per annum
*   **BPI:** Initially liable for damages awarded by MeTC (moral, exemplary, attorney's fees) which were ultimately removed

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Payment by Check:** The central issue revolves around whether delivery of checks constitutes payment.  The Court cites *Abalos v. Macatangay, Jr.* and *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* to reinforce the established rule that a check is not legal tender and mere delivery does not discharge the obligation until encashed.
*   **Lack of Notice of Dishonor:**  Respondents argue they received no notice of dishonor and believed in good faith the checks were encashed. The Court notes that notice of dishonor is primarily for preserving liability on the *check itself*, not the underlying debt.
*   **Laches:** Respondents argue laches due to BPI's delay in demanding payment. The Court rejects this, citing Article 1144 of the Civil Code, stating the action was filed within the 10-year prescriptive period for actions upon a written contract. See *Agra v. Philippine National Bank* for details on laches.
*   **Penalty Clause:** The Court reduces the 3% monthly penalty to 12% per annum, deeming it "iniquitous or unconscionable" based on Article 1229 of the Civil Code.  See *Ligutan v. Court of Appeals* for jurisprudence on equitable reduction of penalties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Art. 1144 (prescription), Art. 1229 (equitable reduction of penalty)
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law:** Sec. 89 (notice of dishonor)
*   **Abalos v. Macatangay, Jr., G.R. No. 155043, September 30, 2004:** Check not legal tender.
*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 49188, January 30, 1990:** Delivery of check doesn't extinguish obligation until payment.
*   **Jimenez v. NLRC, 326 Phil. 89 (1996):** Burden of proof regarding payment.
*   **Agra v. Philippine National Bank, 368 Phil. 829 (1999):**  Laches.
*   **Ligutan v. Court of Appeals, 427 Phil. 42, 51 (2002):** Equitable reduction of penalty.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Areas:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the treatment of the checks. While BPI admitted receiving them, their subsequent handling (allegedly dishonoring some and not depositing others) was not clearly documented or communicated to the Respondents, leading to the dispute.
*   The application of the 36% per annum interest rate until fully paid seems excessive given the circumstances and the partial payments made.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **PARTIALLY GRANTS** BPI's petition. CA Decision is REVERSED and RTC Decision REINSTATED with **MODIFICATION**. Respondents are ordered to deliver the vehicle, or pay P48,084.00 plus late penalty charges/interest at 12% per annum from May 18, 1997 until fully paid. The Court removed the award of damages to the respondents.
