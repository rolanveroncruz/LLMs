**Case Summary: Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 178797**

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the CTA En Banc decision upholding a BIR assessment against Metrobank for deficiency Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) on its Universal Savings Account (UNISA) for 1999.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Metrobank's UNISA, a special savings account evidenced by a passbook, was subject to DST under Section 180 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) *prior* to its amendment by Republic Act No. 9243.
*   **UNISA Details:**  Savings account with higher interest for maintaining a minimum balance over a specified period; withdrawals permitted anytime, but preferential interest lost if balance/period not maintained.
*   **DST Assessment:** BIR assessed Metrobank for deficiency DST under Section 180 of NIRC, arguing UNISA is essentially a certificate of deposit drawing interest.
*   **Tax Amnesty (RA 9480):**  Metrobank availed itself of the tax amnesty program under RA 9480, covering national internal revenue taxes for 2005 and prior.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Liability:** The BIR initially assessed Metrobank for deficiency DST, surcharge, and interest.
*   **Tax Amnesty Relief:** The Supreme Court ultimately relieved Metrobank of the liability due to its valid availment of the Tax Amnesty Program under RA 9480.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Characterization of UNISA:** The core legal battle revolved around whether UNISA was tantamount to a "certificate of deposit bearing interest" as described under Section 180 of the NIRC before amendment by RA 9243. Metrobank argued it was *not* a certificate of deposit and had the characteristics of a savings account allowing depositors to make withdrawals anytime.
*   **Withholding Agent Argument (CIR):** The CIR argued that Metrobank acted as a withholding agent for the DST and hence was precluded from the tax amnesty. The Court found there was no evidence of this as the the assessment made against the bank was for its own failure to pay DST.
*   **Finality of Assessment (CIR):** The CIR argued that the assessment became final due to Metrobank's failure to provide necessary documentation and appeal within stipulated periods. The Court rejected this because the CIR proceeded to make a judgement on the case, despite the time period having elapsed.
*   **DST Coverage Under RA 9480:** Initially the CIR contested that DST was not covered by the tax amnesty program under RA 9480. The Court rejected this due to it being a "national internal revenue tax" not otherwise excluded from the tax amnesty.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 180 NIRC (pre-RA 9243):** Imposed DST on bonds, loan agreements, promissory notes, bills of exchange, etc., including "certificates of deposits drawing interest."
*   **Section 179 NIRC (post-RA 9243):** Amended provision imposing DST on all debt instruments.  Amendments broadened the scope of debt instruments.
*   **Republic Act No. 9243:**  Amended Section 180 of the NIRC (re-numbered as Section 179).
*   **Republic Act No. 9480:**  Tax Amnesty Act of 2007, providing amnesty for unpaid internal revenue taxes for 2005 and prior, subject to certain exceptions (Section 8).
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 9-2000:**  Outlines mode of payment and remittance of DST, clarifies the bank to be responsible for the payment and remittance of DST.

**Case Law:**

*   **Banco de Oro Universal Bank v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (BDO Case):**  Addressed DST liability on a similar special savings account. While initially dismissed on procedural grounds, the court asserted that it also would have been denied due to no error committed by the CTA.
*   **International Exchange Bank v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (IEB Case):**  Held that passbooks representing interest-earning deposits qualify as certificates of deposit drawing interest.
*   **Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Querimit:** Defined certificate of deposit as a written acknowledgement by a bank or banker of the receipt of a sum of money on deposit.
*   **Philippine Banking Corporation (Now: Global Business Bank, Inc.) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (PBC Case):** Confirmed Metrobank was entitled to a tax amnesty under RA 9480 because they had merged and taken over liabilities.

**Ambiguities/Contentions:**

*   The ambiguity in the pre-amendment Section 180 of the NIRC regarding whether special savings accounts evidenced by passbooks fell under the category of "certificates of deposits drawing interest."  Legislative history suggests an intent to close a loophole that banks were exploiting.
*   The proper characterization of Metrobank's UNISA, with the arguments focusing on its similarity to either a regular savings account (not subject to DST) or a time deposit (subject to DST).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CTA's decision based on Metrobank's valid availment of the tax amnesty under RA 9480. The Court found that the CIR's arguments against the amnesty were unpersuasive. This effectively cancels the DST assessment against Metrobank for the 1999 taxable year. The court relies heavily on *stare decisis*, referencing prior rulings on similar issues, solidifying the precedent that time deposits are subject to DST, whether represented by a certificate or a passbook.
