**Legal Document Summary: *Eric Dela Cruz and Raul M. Lacuata vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc.***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 180465, July 31, 2009 (612 Phil. 285)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision which reversed the NLRC's ruling regarding illegal dismissal.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Eric Dela Cruz (Sales Supervisor) and Raul M. Lacuata (Sales Delivery Supervisor).
*   **Respondent:** Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Factual Background:** A Coca-Cola salesman, Raymund Sales, was involved in a vehicular accident while driving a company vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Dela Cruz and Lacuata, along with Sales Supervisor John Espina, were implicated in attempting to alter police and medical reports to omit the fact that Sales was intoxicated.
*   **Employee Code Violation:** Coca-Cola charged Dela Cruz and Lacuata with violating the Employee's Code of Disciplinary Rules and Regulations, specifically in relation to Article 282 of the Labor Code (Serious Misconduct/Willful Disobedience), for producing altered reports and misusing the General Manager's name to do so.
*   **Cause for Termination:** The company alleged loss of trust and confidence due to the petitioners' actions.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The Labor Arbiter initially found Dela Cruz to be illegally dismissed, but held Lacuata responsible for not preventing Espina from obtaining false reports, but still awarded back wages and separation pay. The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter but removed the award of moral damages to dela Cruz. The Court of Appeals reversed the NLRC, finding valid dismissal.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employee's Duty:** Employees, especially supervisors, have a duty to act in the best interests of their employer and to maintain honesty and integrity in their dealings.
*   **Employer's Right:** Employers have the right to terminate employment based on just cause, including loss of trust and confidence, particularly for supervisory positions.
*   **Petitioners' Liability:** Petitioners were deemed to have committed a willful breach of trust and confidence by attempting to conceal the driver's intoxication, thus jeopardizing the employer's interests.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Degree of Participation:** The extent of each petitioner's direct involvement in altering the reports could be a point of contention. Lacuata claimed minimal involvement, but was still found liable.
*   **Proportionality of Penalty:** Petitioners argued that dismissal was a disproportionate penalty. This argument was rejected based on the "trust and confidence rule" applicable to supervisory employees.
*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** The Court appeared to rely heavily on circumstantial evidence to establish the conspiracy and intent to deceive.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282 of the Labor Code:** Grounds for termination by employer (specifically, serious misconduct and willful breach of trust).
*   **Trust and Confidence Rule (Supervisory Employees):** The Court relied on existing jurisprudence allowing for termination based on loss of trust and confidence where the employee occupies a position of responsibility, citing *Sagales v. Rustan's Commercial Corporation, G.R. No. 166554, November 27, 2008.*
*   **General Rule on Factual Findings:** the court cites *Mayon Hotel & Restaurant v. Adana, G.R. No. 157634, May 16, 2005, 458 SCRA 609, 623-624*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ruling does not explicitly define the threshold or specific actions required to constitute a "work-related" breach of trust in similar circumstances.
*   The level of "inaction" sufficient to justify loss of trust and confidence, as applied to Lacuata, is somewhat subjective and could be challenged in future cases.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the termination of Dela Cruz and Lacuata, finding that they committed a work-related willful breach of trust and confidence by attempting to conceal the driver's intoxication, thereby jeopardizing the company's interests. The ruling emphasizes the higher standard of trust expected of supervisory employees.
