**Case Summary: Medel v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 131622, November 27, 1998**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 involving the validity of stipulated interest rates on a loan.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Leticia Y. Medel, Dr. Rafael Medel, and Servando Franco.
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Veronica R. Gonzales and Danilo G. Gonzales, Jr., d/b/a Gonzales Credit Enterprises.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Multiple loans were obtained by Petitioners from Respondents, with increasingly high monthly interest rates.
*   A consolidated promissory note was executed on July 23, 1986, for P500,000.00 with a stipulated interest rate of 5.5% per month plus 2% service charge per annum, and a 1% per month penalty charge.
*   The lower court found the stipulated interest "unconscionable" and applied a 12% per annum rate.
*   The Court of Appeals reversed, upholding the stipulated rate, citing the supposed inexistence of the Usury Law due to Central Bank Circular No. 905.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals.
*   While Central Bank Circular No. 905 effectively removed interest ceilings and made the Usury Law "legally inexistent" (citing *Liam Law v. Olympic Sawmill Co.*), it did not authorize lenders to impose iniquitous or unconscionable interest rates (Art. 1306, Civil Code).  The court reiterates that Circulars cannot repeal statutes, citing *Palanca v. Court of Appeals*.
*   The Court found the stipulated interest rate of 5.5% per month (66% per annum) to be excessive and contrary to morals. The Court cites *Ibarra v. Aveyro* and *Almeda v. Court of Appeals* in support of the ability to void unconscionable interest rate agreements.
*   The SC reinstated the trial court's decision, imposing a 12% per annum interest rate and 1% per month penalty.  Cites Art. 2227 of the Civil Code regarding the reduction of iniquitous liquidated damages, referring to *Joe's Radio and Electrical Supply v. Alto Electronics Corp.*, *Social Security Commission v. Almeda*, and *Palmares v. Court of Appeals*.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to pay the principal amount of the loan, subject to the revised interest rate of 12% per annum and a 1% per month penalty.
*   Respondents are obligated to accept payment at the revised interest rate.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for the principal, 12% interest, 1% monthly penalty, and attorney's fees as originally awarded by the RTC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While the Usury Law is "legally inexistent," extremely high-interest rates are still vulnerable to being declared void as unconscionable and contrary to morals under Art. 1306 of the Civil Code. The lack of clear guidelines on what constitutes an "unconscionable" rate creates uncertainty and potential litigation.
*   The ruling reinforces the power of courts to intervene in contracts where stipulated terms are deemed morally objectionable, even absent explicit statutory prohibition, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes.
*   The waiver of rights under Section 12, Rule 39, of the Revised Rules of Court (related to execution of judgments) may be challenged as unconscionable or against public policy, especially if the debtor is in a demonstrably unequal bargaining position.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "unconscionable" interest rates remains subjective, leaving room for interpretation and potential disputes.
*   The clause regarding adjustments to the peso-obligation based on changes in the value of the peso due to inflation or deflation is vaguely worded and may be difficult to enforce.
*   The waiver of rights under Section 12, Rule 39, is a standard clause but could be subject to challenge on equitable grounds.
