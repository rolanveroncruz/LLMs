## Legal Document Summary: *Malecdan v. Baldo* (A.C. No. 12121)

This is an administrative case where Celestino Malecdan (Complainant) filed a complaint against Atty. Simpson T. Baldo (Respondent) for violating Section 9 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) 1508, the Katarungang Pambarangay Law, which prohibits the appearance of lawyers in Lupon proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Atty. Baldo admitted appearing as counsel for his relatives (spouses Baldo) in a barangay hearing, despite the prohibition in Section 9 of P.D. 1508.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Court found Atty. Baldo liable for violating Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Section 9 of P.D. 1508 mandates personal confrontation without counsel to encourage amicable settlements (citing *Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*).
    *   Appearance of lawyers violates the intent of the law by introducing a formal, adversarial element.
    *   Canon 1 requires lawyers to uphold the law. Rule 1.01 prohibits unlawful conduct (defined broadly).
*   **Sanction:** Atty. Baldo was reprimanded with a stern warning.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Baldo's Obligation:** To comply with all laws, including P.D. 1508 and abide by CPR.
*   **Atty. Baldo's Liability:** Found liable for violating Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the CPR due to his appearance in the Lupon proceedings.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Initial Interpretation:** The Investigating Commissioner initially found the language of the Katarungang Pambarangay Law ambiguous and recommended only a warning. The IBP Board of Governors reversed this. This suggests a potential area of dispute regarding the strictness of the prohibition.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** Atty. Baldo argued he sought and obtained permission to participate in the barangay dialogue, but this argument was rejected by the Supreme Court.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** A repetition of similar conduct could result in more severe disciplinary action against Atty. Baldo.
*   **Impact of *Ledesma*:** The Court relies heavily on *Ledesma* to establish the mandatory nature of the prohibition. Any challenge to the interpretation of *Ledesma* could weaken the basis for the ruling.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Presidential Decree 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay Law), Section 9:** Prohibits lawyer participation in Lupon proceedings.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 1 & Rule 1.01:** Requires lawyers to uphold the law and prohibits unlawful conduct.
*   ***Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*, 286 Phil. 917 (1992):** Interprets Section 9 of P.D. 1508 as mandatory to ensure personal confrontation between parties.
