## Legal Document Summary: *Geronimo J. Jimeno, Jr. v. Atty. Flordeliza M. Jimeno*, A.C. No. 12012

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case against a lawyer, Atty. Flordeliza M. Jimeno.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Jimeno should be held administratively liable for:
*   Falsifying a public document (Deed of Absolute Sale).
*   Violating client confidentiality.

**Facts:** Complainant Geronimo Jimeno Jr. (Complainant), cousin of Respondent Atty. Flordeliza Jimeno (Respondent), filed a complaint for disbarment based on the sale of property belonging to his deceased parents (Spouses Jimeno). Complainant alleges that the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Respondent as attorney-in-fact for Complainant's father contained falsehoods, including the signature of his deceased mother, and misrepresented the ownership status of the property. Complainant also alleges violation of attorney-client privilege.

**Key Provisions & Alleged Violations:**

*   **Rule 1.01, Canon 1, CPR (Unlawful, Dishonest, Immoral or Deceitful Conduct):** The Court found Respondent liable for signing the Deed of Absolute Sale containing false information, despite knowledge (or implied knowledge) of the inaccuracies.
*   **Rule 15.07, Canon 15, CPR (Candor, Fairness, and Loyalty to Client):** The Court ruled that Respondent failed to impress upon her client the need for compliance with laws, specifically regarding estate settlement and proper documentation.
*   **Rule 19.01, Canon 19, CPR (Representing Client Zealously Within the Bounds of Law):** Respondent failed to employ only fair and honest means to attain the objectives of her client.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Basis for disbarment or suspension for deceit, malpractice, gross misconduct in office, etc.
*   **Canon 21, CPR (Preserving Client Confidences):** The Court found insufficient evidence to substantiate the violation of attorney-client privilege.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty to be honest and truthful in dealings with clients and the courts.
*   Duty to advise clients to comply with the law.
*   Duty to conduct oneself with fidelity to the courts and clients.
*   Obligation not to consent to falsehoods.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Jimeno was found GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Rule 1.01 of Canon 1, Rule 15.07 of Canon 15, and Rule 19.01 of Canon 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Specifically, Canon 1, Rule 1.01; Canon 15, Rule 15.07; Canon 19, Rule 19.01; Canon 21.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.**
*   **Jimenez v. Francisco, 749 Phil. 551 (2014):** Similar case involving untruthful statements in public documents, resulting in suspension.
*   **Bongalonta v. Castillo, 310 Phil. 320 (1995):** Similar case involving falsehood, also resulting in suspension.
*   **Mercado v. Vitriolo (498 Phil. 49 [2005]):** Discusses the factors essential to establish the existence of lawyer client privilege.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Respondent's knowledge of Perla's death was not explicitly admitted but implied from her familiarity with the family situation and communications regarding the property sale after Perla's passing. This implication was used against her.
*   Respondent's reliance on the assurances of the Jimeno children was rejected as a defense, reinforcing the lawyer's independent duty to uphold the law.

**Potential Risks/Implications:**

*   The case highlights the importance of lawyers independently verifying the accuracy of documents, even when acting as a conduit for client instructions.
*   The case reinforces the principle that a lawyer cannot use good faith or reliance on client assurances as a defense for participating in falsifying public documents.
*   This case serves as a warning to lawyers about the consequences of overlooking "patent irregularities" in legal documents and the ethical obligations to uphold the law above client directives.
