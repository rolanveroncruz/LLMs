**Subject: Summary of A.M. No. P-06-2182 (Camus, Jr. v. Alegre)**

**Case Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Reynaldo L. Alegre, Clerk of Court, MTC Paniqui, Tarlac, for Direct Bribery and subsequently for Grave Misconduct. The initial complaint stemmed from an entrapment operation where Alegre allegedly solicited and received money (₱1,000 marked money) from spouses Mamaba in exchange for facilitating the release of their son, who had a pending criminal case for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Serious Physical Injury and Damage to Property. Although the criminal case for Direct Bribery was dismissed based on an Affidavit of Desistance by the Mamabas, the Supreme Court held that such dismissal did not render the administrative case moot.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Grave Misconduct (initially Direct Bribery).
*   **Factual Basis:** Alleged solicitation and receipt of money from Sps. Mamaba, confirmed by an entrapment operation and the discovery of marked money in Alegre's drawer.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denied demanding money, claiming the spouses offered it as "snacks" for court personnel and placed it in his drawer without his consent.  He argued the dismissal of the criminal case should abate the administrative matter.
*   **Court's Holding:** Found Alegre guilty of Grave Misconduct. His explanation was deemed unpersuasive and contradicted by the Affidavit of Arrest from police officers (SPO3 Bobby A. Madamba, SPO1 James D. Lacamento and PO3 Romeo S. Parchamento) and the presumption of regularity in their conduct.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and perpetual disqualification from re-employment in government service.

**Obligations:**

*   Alegre, as a court employee, had a duty to adhere to ethical standards, avoid conflicts of interest, and refrain from soliciting or accepting any gifts, favors, or benefits that could influence his official functions, as per Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC).

**Liabilities:**

*   Alegre is held liable for Grave Misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Dismissal of Criminal Case:** The dismissal of the Direct Bribery charge based on the Affidavit of Desistance raised a potential issue of res judicata, or at the very least, collateral estoppel. However, the court correctly distinguished between criminal and administrative liability.
*   **Hearsay & Evidence:** The case relies heavily on the testimony of the arresting officers and the documents.  Alegre's defense centered on attacking the credibility of these sources.
*   **Judge Castañeda's Error:**  Investigating Judge Castañeda improperly dismissed the case due to the complainant's (Camus) lack of appearance. This highlights the Court's independent disciplinary power over its employees, irrespective of the complainant's actions, as per *Rodriguez v. Eugenio, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2216*. Judge Castañeda did not exercise her coercive powers to summon all parties to ferret out the truth.
*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence (from Alegre's side):** Respondent's failure to present witnesses (e.g., Judge Rosete, Mayor Ibarra, Darmie Mamaba, co-workers) to support his version of events significantly weakened his defense.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order 292:** Section 23, Rule XIV - Defines Grave Misconduct and its corresponding penalties.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Canon I, Sections 1 & 2 - Prohibits court personnel from using their position for unwarranted benefits and from soliciting/accepting gifts that could influence their functions.
*   **Rodriguez v. Eugenio, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2216:** Affirmed the court's disciplinary powers even if the complainant desists. Defines misconduct.
*   **Section 7, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court:** Pertaining to preliminary investigation responsibilities of the prosecutor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The dismissal based on the affidavit of desistance created an ambiguity that the court had to clarify: dismissal of the criminal case did not equate to dismissal of the administrative matter.
