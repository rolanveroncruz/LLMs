## Legal Document Summary: People v. Pundugar (G.R. No. 214779)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment convicting Abdulwahid Pundugar of violating Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):** Appellant was found guilty of selling 0.04 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a poseur-buyer during a buy-bust operation. Penalty: Life imprisonment and a fine of Php 500,000.00.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Appellant was found in possession of 0.20 gram of shabu during his arrest. Penalty: 12 years and 1 day to 14 years imprisonment, and a fine of Php 300,000.00.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Focus of the appeal. Appellant argued the police officers' non-compliance with the prescribed procedures for handling seized drugs, specifically regarding immediate marking and inventory at the crime scene and the lack of required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official). The Court emphasizes that while strict compliance is preferred, non-compliance is not fatal if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved and justifiable grounds exist for non-compliance.

**Obligations:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Proper handling and documentation of seized drugs, including marking, inventory, and photographing, adhering to Section 21 of RA 9165 (or providing justifiable reasons for deviations). Duty to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs to ensure proper chain of custody.
*   **Accused:** Obligation to demonstrate a lack of knowledge or authority to possess the drugs if charged under Section 11 of RA 9165.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Criminal liability for violating Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165.
*   **Law Enforcement (Potential):** Potential for evidence suppression and case dismissal if the chain of custody is broken due to improper handling of evidence or lack of justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21):**  The main point of contention is the application of Section 21, RA 9165 regarding the procedure of handling the seized drugs by police officers.  Appellant argued the police failed to comply with Section 21 and the chain of custody was broken.  The court found the police had justifiable reasons for delayed marking, inventory, and photographing, but this is a fact-specific determination, creating potential for future appeals based on similar alleged violations of Sec 21.
*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception:**  The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings that the prosecution was able to establish that "they were not able to invite representatives from the media, the DOJ, or an elected public official because they could not find anyone available and that they were pressed for time." This is an area ripe for future argument as what constitutes "justifiable grounds" can be very fact dependent and leaves room for interpretation.
*   **Defense of Denial/Frame-Up:** The court summarily dismisses the appellant's defense of denial and frame-up, which is a common defense in drug cases. The effectiveness of this defense hinges on presenting credible and convincing evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The core statute under which the accused was charged.
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165 (although the unamended version applies to this case, the amended version informs current interpretation).
*   **People v. Alcala, 739 Phil. 189 (2014):** Elements of illegal sale of drugs.
*   **People v. Abedin, 685 Phil. 552 (2012):** Elements of illegal possession of drugs.
*   **People v. Salonga, 617 Phil. 997 (2009):** Emphasizes the presentation of the drug itself is the corpus delicti.
*   **People v. Unisa, 674 Phil. 89 (2011):** Section 21 ensures preservation of integrity of seized drugs.
*   **People v. Le, 636 Phil. 586 (2010):** Strict compliance with procedures in inventory does not render arrest illegal or the items inadmissible. What is essential is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.
*   **People v. Resurreccion, 618 Phil. 520 (2009):** Guidelines on the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 as amended by Republic Act No. 10640 (Guidelines)
*   **People v. Velasquez, 685 Phil. 538 (2012):** The defense of denial or frame-up, like alibi, has been invariably viewed by the courts with disfavor for it can just as easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in most prosecutions for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act
*   **RA 9346:** AN ACT PROHIBITING THE IMPOSITION OF DEATH PENALTY IN THE PHILIPPINES.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** The purpose of this rule is to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence which could considerably affect a case.
*   **People v. Goco, G.R. No. 219584, October 17, 2016, 806 SCRA 240, 252:** Noncompliance with this requirement, however, would not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (a) there is justifiable ground for noncompliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024, 1053 (2012):** Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for noncompliance.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018:** Then the State retains the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody of the drugs/items seized from the accused, regardless of whether or not the defense raises the same in the proceedings a quo

**Dissenting Opinion (Perlas-Bernabe, J.):**

Argued that the police officers' justification for non-compliance with Section 21 (unavailability of witnesses, being "pressed for time") was insufficient.  Stressed the need for earnest efforts to secure the presence of witnesses.  Concluded that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were compromised due to the non-compliance with Section 21 and would vote to acquit. This dissent highlights the importance of strictly adhering to chain-of-custody procedures in drug cases.

**Overall Assessment:**

The court affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the preservation of the integrity of the drugs seized and deeming the prosecution's explanation for deviation from standard procedure as justifiable. The dissent, however, underscores the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and raises potential grounds for appeal or future challenges to similar convictions based on similar alleged violations of chain of custody. The 'justifiable grounds' exception provides flexibility but also potential for abuse and further litigation.
