**Legal Document Summary: *Maria Paz V. Nepomuceno vs. City of Surigao***

**Case:** G.R. No. 146091, July 28, 2008

**Nature:** Petition assailing the CA decision affirming with modification the RTC decision in a complaint for "Recovery of Real Property and/or its Market Value."  The case concerns a 652 sq. m. portion of the petitioner's land used by the City of Surigao for a road without expropriation proceedings or permission.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **City of Surigao's Obligation:** To pay petitioner compensation for the land taken. Initially ordered by the RTC to pay P3,260.00, with legal interest from 1960, and attorney's fees of P5,000.
*   **Petitioner's Obligation (Upon Payment):** Execute a deed of conveyance in favor of the City of Surigao.

**Liabilities:**

*   **City of Surigao:** Liable for compensation based on the *value of the land at the time of taking (1960)*, *plus legal interest from that date until full payment.* The CA added liability for moral damages (P30,000) and attorney's fees and litigation expenses (P20,000).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** The core contention is the proper valuation date. Petitioners argued for current market value at the time of payment, while the Court upheld the established precedent that compensation is based on the value *at the time of taking* where no prior expropriation occurred. *See Republic v. Lara, Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr., Alfonso v. Pasay City.*
*   **Lack of Contractual Obligation:** The Court rejected the application of Article 1250 of the Civil Code regarding extraordinary inflation/deflation because no contractual agreement existed between the parties. This limits the petitioners' ability to argue for a more equitable adjustment of the compensation based on inflation.
*   **Missing Road Right-of-Way Agreement:** The City's initial defense relied on a lost road right-of-way agreement allegedly signed by the previous landowners. While relevant for establishing consent, its absence didn't negate the City's liability for just compensation due to the subsequent taking without expropriation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** The case implicitly involves the City's exercise of eminent domain. *See Article III, Section 9 of the 1987 Constitution*.
*   **Just Compensation:** The primary legal issue revolves around determining "just compensation" in an inverse condemnation scenario.
*   **Republic v. Lara (96 Phil. 170 (1954)):**  Established the precedent for valuing property at the time of taking when actual taking precedes expropriation.
*   **Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr. (G.R. No. 50147, 03 August 1990, 188 SCRA 300):** Reaffirmed the "time of taking" rule.
*   **Article 1250, Civil Code:**  Attempted application to adjust the value of currency due to inflation, but deemed inapplicable due to the absence of a contractual obligation.
*   **Municipality of La Carlota v. Spouses Gan (150-A Phil. 588, 597 (1972)):** Referenced, specifically Justice Barredo's concurring opinion on the basis of property value, which was rejected.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of a formal expropriation proceeding and the ambiguity surrounding the initial agreement between the city and former landowners are central to the legal dispute.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, upholding the CA decision, which affirmed the RTC ruling with modifications on moral damages and attorney's fees.  The compensation is to be based on the land's value in 1960, plus legal interest. The exemplary damages claim was also denied.
