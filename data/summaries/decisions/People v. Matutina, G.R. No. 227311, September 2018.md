## Legal Document Summary: People v. Matutina & Romero, G.R. No. 227311

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Jelmer Matutina y Maylas and Robert Romero y Buensalida*

**Citation:** G.R. No. 227311, September 26, 2018 (840 Phil. 664)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellants for rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) in relation to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610 (child abuse protection). Information alleged conspiracy with a third party (Lim, at-large) to have sexual intercourse with the victim (AAA), a 15-year-old minor, using force and intimidation.
*   **Elements of Rape (Art. 266-A, RPC):** Court found all elements established: a) carnal knowledge; b) through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Conspiracy:** Proven by concerted actions of Matutina, Romero, and Lim to restrain the victim, facilitating the act.
*   **Penetration:**  Established through the testimony of the victim and the medico-legal report which indicated blunt penetrating trauma to the posterior fourchette. The Court explicitly stated that full penetration is not required for consummated rape, citing *People v. Campuhan*.  Penetration of the lips of the vagina constitutes rape.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellants (Matutina & Romero):** Convicted as principals of the crime of rape.
*   **Sentence:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liabilities:**  P75,000.00 civil indemnity, P75,000.00 moral damages, and P75,000.00 exemplary damages. Increased from original RTC award, citing *People v. Jugueta*. Six percent (6%) interest per annum imposed on all monetary awards from the date of finality of the judgment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The court heavily relies on the victim's testimony and the medico-legal report, giving great weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. The defense's denial is deemed weak.
*   **Intact Hymen:** The fact that the victim's hymen was not lacerated is deemed inconsequential, adhering to established jurisprudence that penetration, however slight, is sufficient for rape conviction.
*   **Third Party at Large:** The involvement of Lim (at-large) may present future issues if he is apprehended and tried separately, potentially leading to inconsistent findings of fact regarding the conspiracy.
*   **Conspiracy Proof Sufficiency:** Defense might argue that the acts attributed to Romero did not unequivocally establish the existence of a pre-determined agreement to commit rape.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** Case relies heavily on testimony and medico-legal findings; absence of other physical evidence could be seen as a weakness, although not determinative in this decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) (Rape)
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610:** Child Abuse Law
*   **People v. Campuhan, 385 Phil. 912 (2000):** On the definition and proof of penetration for rape.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Matutina and Romero for the rape of a minor based on the victim's credible testimony and medical evidence of penetration. The court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between the accused and a third party. The decision highlights the legal principle that even minimal penetration is sufficient for a rape conviction and reiterates the importance of the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. The civil liabilities were increased to reflect current jurisprudence, and legal interest was imposed. The main legal risk for the appellants is the affirmation of their conviction with a potentially difficult path for future appeals or motions for reconsideration.
