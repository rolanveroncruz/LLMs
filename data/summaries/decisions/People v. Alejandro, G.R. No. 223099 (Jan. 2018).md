## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Alejandro* (G.R. No. 223099)

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for two counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353, involving a 12-year-old minor.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC erred in recalling its initial judgment of acquittal and subsequently convicting the accused, violating his right against double jeopardy.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision, holding that the RTC's recall of the acquittal violated the accused's right against double jeopardy. The accused was acquitted.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:**  The Court reiterated the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, citing Section 7, Rule 117 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure. All elements for double jeopardy were present: (1) valid information, (2) competent court, (3) arraignment and plea, and (4) initial judgment of acquittal.
*   **Finality of Acquittal:** Emphasized the doctrine that a judgment of acquittal is final, unappealable, and immediately executory upon promulgation.  *People v. Hon. Asis, et al.* and *Villareal v. Aliga* are cited.
*   **Exceptions to Double Jeopardy:**  While acknowledging exceptions (deprivation of due process, mistrial, grave abuse of discretion), the Court found none applicable. The prosecution had the opportunity to present its case.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:**  The Court referenced *People v. Laguio, Jr.*, reiterating that double jeopardy does not attach *only* when the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction (e.g., prosecution denied opportunity to present its case).  This standard was not met.
*   **Invalid Recall:** The recall was based on a "mere manifestation" by the prosecutor regarding a mistake (failure to consider the victim's testimony). The Court cited *Argel v. Judge Pascua*, where a judge was sanctioned for recalling a judgment of acquittal, demonstrating gross ignorance of law. A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 should have been filed instead.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Formal Motion:**  The decision emphasizes that the recall was based on a "mere manifestation," not a formal motion. This raises questions about the procedural irregularities and potential due process concerns.
*   **Erroneous Initial Decision:**  The RTC's error in issuing an acquittal based on incomplete information is concerning. While the Court rightly protected against double jeopardy, this case highlights the need for careful judicial fact-finding.
*   **Victim's Rights:** While the legal analysis focused on the accused's rights, a future claim might arise regarding the violation of the victim's right to due process and a fair opportunity for justice.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Rape.
*   **Section 7, Rule 117, Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Double Jeopardy.
*   **People v. Hon. Asis, et al. 643 Phil. 462, 469 (2010):**  Finality of acquittal doctrine.
*   **Villareal v. Aliga, 724 Phil. 47, 62 (2014):** Finality of acquittal doctrine.
*   **People v. Laguio, Jr., 547 Phil. 296 (2007):** Grave abuse of discretion exception to double jeopardy.
*   **Argel v. Judge Pascua, 415 Phil. 608 (2001):**  Impropriety of recalling an acquittal; judge sanctioned for gross ignorance.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  Petition for Certiorari (appropriate remedy for challenging acquittal based on grave abuse of discretion).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court applied the principle of finality of acquittal, even in the face of a demonstrable error by the trial court. The Court's ruling emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional rights, even when it results in an arguably unjust outcome. The case exposes a need for vigilance in judicial fact-finding and the proper procedural mechanisms for correcting errors without violating fundamental rights.
