**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Sheriff Apollo R. Ragot for grave misconduct, neglect of duty, and dishonesty related to the implementation of a writ of execution in Criminal Case No. 2005-363 (BP 22 violation).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Violation of Rule 141, Section 10 (Rules of Court as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC):** Ragot failed to obtain court approval for estimated expenses *before* serving the writ, and directly received funds from the complainant (Ramos) without the required court-approved estimate and deposit with the Clerk of Court. The approved estimate of expenses was provided to complainant almost four months after the writ was served. Cites *Letter of Atty. Socorro M. Villamer-Basilla* and *Bunagan v. Ferraren*, stating direct demand is tantamount to dishonesty.
*   **Violation of Rule 39, Section 14 (Rules of Court):** Ragot failed to submit timely or periodic (every 30 days) reports on the status of the writ execution to the court after receiving the writ in October 2006.

The decision reinforces the need for sheriffs to strictly adhere to established legal protocols and to uphold the integrity of the judicial process.
