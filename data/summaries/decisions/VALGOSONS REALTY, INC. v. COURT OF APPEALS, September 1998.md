## Legal Document Summary: Valgosons Realty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, Urban Development Bank and Prudential Bank (G.R. No. 126233, September 11, 1998)

**Core Issue:** Liability for failure to deliver leased premises to a new lessee (UDB) due to the holdover of a prior lessee (PB).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Valgosons Realty, Inc. (VRI) as Lessor:** Entered into a lease contract with Urban Development Bank (UDB) *while* Prudential Bank (PB) was still occupying the premises under a prior lease. VRI had the obligation under **Article 1654 of the New Civil Code** to deliver the premises to UDB in a condition fit for its intended use.
*   **Urban Development Bank (UDB) as Lessee:** Entitled to possession of the leased premises as per the lease contract with VRI. Sought rescission and damages due to VRI's failure to deliver.
*   **Prudential Bank (PB) as Prior Lessee:** Initially notified VRI of its intent to terminate its lease early. However, PB held over, continuing to pay rent which VRI accepted. The court invokes **Article 1670 of the Civil Code**, suggesting an implied lease on a month-to-month basis.

**Liabilities & Judgement:**

*   **VRI Liable to UDB:** VRI held liable for damages to UDB (including advance rentals, lost construction costs, relocation expenses) because of its failure to deliver the premises, as it bore the risk of the failure to deliver. The CA upheld the trial court's decision to this effect, citing that it was VRI's obligation as lessor to deliver the premises, including ejecting any unlawful occupants if necessary (**Article 1673 of the New Civil Code**).
*   **PB NOT Liable to UDB:** The CA absolved PB from liability to VRI. The Supreme Court agreed, asserting no privity of contract exists between the two lessees. The responsibility for ensuring vacant possession rested with VRI.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **PB's Termination Letter:** While PB sent a letter indicating early termination, its legal effect is questionable. The letter may not have been properly authorized, and VRI's continued acceptance of rent from PB creates ambiguity regarding the actual termination date.
*   **Implied Lease:** The application of Article 1670 and the concept of implied lease to PB potentially creates a defense for PB against any claims by VRI regarding the period after the originally intended early termination date.
*   **Damages:** The types of damages awarded to UDB (lost construction costs, relocation expenses) could be challenged regarding causation and foreseeability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1654, New Civil Code:** Lessor's obligation to deliver the thing leased in suitable condition.
*   **Article 1659, New Civil Code:** Remedies for non-compliance with lease obligations (rescission and/or damages).
*   **Article 1670, New Civil Code:** Implied new lease due to continued possession with lessor's acquiescence. This is the key article absolving PB of further responsibility.
*   **Article 1673, New Civil Code:** Lessor's duty to eject unlawful occupants.
*   **Manahan, Jr. v. CA, 255 SCRA 202:** Case cited supporting the application of implied lease under Article 1670.

**Conclusion:**

The court affirmed the CA decision, placing the liability squarely on VRI for failing to deliver the leased premises to UDB. Despite PB's initial notice of early termination, VRI's acceptance of rent and continued dealings with PB created an implied lease, thus negating VRI's claim against PB. The primary risk lies in the potentially high damage award against VRI, and whether that judgement can be satisfied. The lesson of this case is that a Lessor must ensure vacant possession before leasing to a subsequent tenant.
