**Legal Document Summary: *Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (G.R. No. 168863)***

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision dismissing a petition for certiorari.

**Key Facts:** Honorio Torres & Sons, Inc. (HTSI), through Roberto H. Torres, filed a petition for annulment of Real Estate Mortgage and Foreclosure Sale against several Torres family members, the Register of Deeds of Marikina and Quezon City, and Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. The RTC denied Hi-Yield's motion to dismiss based on improper venue and insufficient docket fees, classifying the case as a derivative suit cognizable by a special commercial court. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed. Hi-Yield appealed to the Supreme Court via certiorari, arguing improper venue, misjoinder, and that the annulment action was the primary relief sought, not merely incidental to a derivative suit.

**Key Provisions and Rulings:**

*   **Nature of Action:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's ruling that the action is primarily a derivative suit. Cites *Filipinas Port Services, Inc. v. Go* for the requisites of a derivative suit.
*   **Derivative Suit Elements:** Roberto Torres satisfied the requirements for filing a derivative suit, notably, the allegation of mismanagement and abuses by corporate officers (Leonora Torres) in paragraph 5 of the petition.
*   **Exhaustion of Intra-Corporate Remedies:** Exhaustion of intra-corporate remedies was not required because the corporation was controlled by the individuals being sued, making demand on the board futile.
*   **Venue:** Proper venue for derivative suits under A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC (Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799) is the RTC where the corporation's principal office is located (Makati in this case).
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner (Hi-Yield) improperly filed a petition for certiorari when a petition for review on certiorari was available. Certiorari is only appropriate where there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **HTSI/Roberto Torres:** Obligation to pay any deficiency in docket fees as directed by the RTC.
*   **Hi-Yield Realty, Inc.:** Remained a party to the case, subject to the jurisdiction of the Makati RTC as determined by the derivative nature of the underlying action.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Derivative Suit Success:** Hi-Yield faces the risk that HTSI will succeed in the derivative suit, leading to the annulment of the real estate mortgage and foreclosure sale, potentially impacting Hi-Yield's property rights.
*   **Compliance with Discovery/Proceedings:** Hi-Yield will be subject to discovery and other procedural requirements related to the ongoing litigation in the RTC.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Filipinas Port Services, Inc. v. Go, G.R. No. 161886, March 16, 2007, 518 SCRA 453* (Derivative Suit Requisites)
*   *A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC* (Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies under Republic Act No. 8799)
*   *Rule 65 of the Rules of Court* (Certiorari)
*   *Rule 45 of the Rules of Court* (Appeal by Certiorari)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was the *characterization of the action as derivative vs. real action*, as this determination significantly impacted the issue of proper venue. The SC upheld the lower courts' classification of the suit.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Hi-Yield's petition for certiorari, upholding the lower courts' determination that the underlying case is a derivative suit properly filed in Makati. Hi-Yield remains a party to the case and faces the potential consequences of an adverse ruling in the derivative action.
