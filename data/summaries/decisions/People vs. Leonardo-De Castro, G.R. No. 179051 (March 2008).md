**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Forcible abduction with rape, as defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659). The information included the aggravating circumstances of using a motor vehicle, disregard of sex and age, and superior strength.

*   **Trial Court (RTC) Decision:** Found Mallari guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, plus Php 50,000 in moral damages.

*   **Appellate Court (CA) Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision, modifying the damages to include Php 50,000 civil indemnity, in addition to the Php 50,000 moral damages.

*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the CA decision, upholding Mallari's conviction for simple rape and maintaining the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*, with the awarded damages.

**Obligations:**

*   Mallari is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Mallari is obligated to pay AAA Php 50,000 as civil indemnity and Php 50,000 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Mallari is criminally liable for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Mallari is civilly liable for the damages arising from the rape.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The document does not present any potential double jeopardy issues as the case progressed through the appropriate appellate channels.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** None are apparent in this document as the defendant was given the opportunity to present his defense.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mendoza, 440 Phil. 775, 785-786 (2002):** Cited by the CA to support the award of civil indemnity in rape cases.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659):** Defines and penalizes the crime of rape.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original information included aggravating circumstances (use of motor vehicle, disregard of sex and age, and superior strength) that were apparently not proven or considered in the final judgment of "simple rape" and the Supreme Court decision.
*   There is no detail provided on the basis for finding the defendant guilty of simple rape rather than forcible abduction with rape.
