**Legal Document Summary: *Excellent Essentials International Corporation v. Extra Excel International Philippines, Inc.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 192797, April 18, 2018 (830 Phil. 24)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Facts:** This case concerns a dispute over exclusive distributorship rights for E. Excel products in the Philippines. Excel Philippines (Respondent) was initially granted exclusive rights by E. Excel International, Inc. (Excel International). Later, following an internal corporate power struggle within Excel International, its president, Stewart, revoked Excel Philippines' rights and granted them to Excellent Essentials (Petitioner). Excel Philippines continued operations, prompting a suit for injunction and damages by Excel International and Excellent Essentials.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Exclusive Distributorship Agreements:**
    *   The initial 1996 agreement between Excel International and Excel Philippines granted exclusive rights to the latter, but reserved Excel International's right to alter the agreement.
    *   A prior 1995 agreement between Excel International and Bright Vision Consultants, Ltd. (BV), stipulated the creation of Excel Philippines with "irrevocable and exclusive right to distribute, market and/or sell the Products of E. Excel USA in the Philippines."
    *   Clause 3.9 of the Agreement: The Exclusive Distributorship awarded by E. Excel USA to the New Company may not be modified, transferred or terminated except by an instrument in writing signed by the duly authorized representative of E. Excel USA, and BV.
    *   Clause 8.1 of the Agreement: This Agreement can only be modified by an instrument in writing signed by duly authorized representatives of both E. Excel USA and BV.
*   **Revocation of Exclusive Rights:** The unilateral revocation of Excel Philippines' exclusive rights by Stewart, while acting as president of Excel International, formed the core dispute.
*   **Tortious Interference (Art. 1314, Civil Code):** The Supreme Court focused on whether Excellent Essentials tortiously interfered with the contract between Excel International and Excel Philippines/Bright Vision. Elements: (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) knowledge on the part of the third person of the existence of contract; and (3) interference of the third person is without legal justification or excuse. *So Ping Bun v. CA* controls.
*   **Damages:** Excel Philippines sought damages for the loss of sales and other related costs. The CA awarded temperate and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. The Supreme Court reversed the temperate damages award and granted nominal damages.
*   **Res Judicata/Conclusiveness of Judgment:** The Supreme Court addressed whether the CA's prior ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 65115 (regarding a preliminary injunction) was binding on the main case regarding damages. The court held that findings related to the preliminary injunction were interlocutory and not conclusive on the ultimate issue of damages.
* Legal Interest: Legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the time this judgment becomes final and executory until this judgment is wholly satisfied was imposed

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Excellent Essentials:** Found liable for tortious interference with the contract between Excel International and Excel Philippines/Bright Vision because, inter alia, the incorporators of Excellent Essentials conspired with Stewart to undermine Excel Philippines; ordered to pay nominal damages of P50,000,000.00.
*   **Excel International:** Breached its contract with Excel Philippines/Bright Vision by unilaterally revoking the exclusive distributorship rights.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Damages:** The Supreme Court was critical of Excel Philippines' method of calculating damages, specifically rejecting projected sales figures and forecasted computations as a sufficient basis for awarding temperate damages.
*   **Corporate Liability:** This case emphasizes the potential liability of a corporation for actions of its officers and directors, particularly in situations involving contractual interference.
*   **Good Faith vs. Bad Faith:** Excellent Essentials argued it acted in good faith, relying on Stewart's authority. The Court rejected this argument, finding evidence of conspiracy and bad faith.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 1314 (Tortious Interference)**
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2224 (Temperate Damages)**
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2221 (Nominal Damages)**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 58, Section 3 (Preliminary Injunction)**
*   ***So Ping Bun v. CA***: Key precedent on the elements of tortious interference.
*   ***Yu v. CA***: Proprietary rights to exclusive distributorship agreements

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court **DENIED** Excellent Essentials' petition. It affirmed the CA's decision finding Excellent Essentials liable for tortious interference but modified the award for damages, substituting temperate damages with nominal damages of P50,000,000.00. Legal interest was imposed on the total amount adjudged.
