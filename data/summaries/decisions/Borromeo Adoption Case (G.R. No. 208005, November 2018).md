**Case Summary: *Re: Adoption of Karen Herico Licerio. Joel H. Borromeo and Carmen H. Borromeo*, G.R. No. 208005, November 21, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari challenging the RTC's denial of a motion to correct a final adoption decree due to immutability of judgment.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Adoption Decree:** The RTC of Marikina City previously granted a petition for the joint adoption of Karen by Petitioners in a decision dated June 27, 2006.
*   **Duplicitous Birth Registration:** Post-judgment, it was discovered Karen's birth was registered in both Quezon City and Caloocan City. The Quezon City Civil Registrar refused to implement the adoption decree due to the Caloocan City registration.
*   **Motion to Correct:** Petitioners sought to amend the adoption decree to include the "City Civil Registrar of Caloocan City" to facilitate implementation but the RTC of Marikina City denied based on the doctrine of immutability of judgments.
*   **Immutability of Judgments vs. Substantial Justice:** The central issue is whether the doctrine of immutability of judgment bars the correction of the adoption decree to address the practical impossibility of its execution due to the duplicitous birth registration.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Adopters' Obligation:** Petitioners have the legal obligation stemming from the adoption decree to register the adoption and have Karen's birth certificate amended.
*   **Civil Registrar's Duty:** The Civil Registrar (initially Quezon City) has the statutory duty under R.A. 8552 to implement the adoption decree by amending Karen's birth certificate and sealing the original record.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Impossibility of Performance:** Strict adherence to immutability of judgment would render the adoption decree unenforceable, frustrating its intent and purpose.
*   **Procedural Rigidity vs. Justice:** The case highlights the conflict between strict procedural rules and achieving substantial justice.
*   **Res Judicata Argument:** While the adoption itself is final, the appropriate venue for implementing that adoption and correcting discrepancies in the civil registry could be argued as a new cause of action, thus not barred.
*   **Duplicitous Registry:** The Court addressed the duplicate records and its obstruction to an enforeceable ruling.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8552 (Domestic Adoption Act of 1998):** Governs the adoption process and the rights and obligations of adopters and adoptees. Section 16 addresses the effects of adoption, including the issuance of a new birth certificate.
*   **Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court (Execution of Judgments):** Although mentioned by petitioners, the court found that the rule does not apply as the proceedings are special.

**Case Law References:**

*   ***Antonio Mendoza v. Fil-Homes Realty Development Corporation*, 681 Phil. 621 (2012):** Defines the doctrine of immutability of judgment and its exceptions.
*   ***City of Butuan v. Ortiz*, 113 Phil. 636 (1961):** Discusses circumstances rendering execution of judgment unjust or impossible.
*   ***Candelario, et al. v. Canizares, et al.*, 114 Phil. 672 (1962):** Discusses how new circumstances change rights of the parties, and may warrant the court to suspend execution of a final judgment, admit evidence of new facts and circumstances, and grant the relief warranted based on such new facts and circumstances.
*   ***Barnes v. Judge Padilla*, 482 Phil. 672 (2004):** Enumerates instances where this court has relaxed this rule of substantial justice.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, setting aside the RTC's orders and REMANDING the case to the RTC of Marikina City. The RTC is directed to: (1) RECEIVE evidence on the duplicitous registration; (2) DETERMINE the proper OCR to enforce the adoption decree; and (3) CORRECT the decision, if needed, *only* as to the proper OCR.

**Rationale:**

The Court held that an exception to the doctrine of immutability of judgment applies because new facts (the duplicitous registration and its consequences) rendered the original decree impossible to execute.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

The Court's decision gives the Petitioners an opportunity to present evidence on the location of Karen's birth and the circumstances surrounding the registration in Caloocan City. The Court may ultimately determine which OCR should implement the adoption decree, providing a practical solution and avoiding further litigation.
