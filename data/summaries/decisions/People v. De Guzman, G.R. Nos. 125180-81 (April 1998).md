## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Guzman*, G.R. Nos. 125180-81 (1998)

**Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Dennis de Guzman of two counts of murder for the deaths of Ernesto and Edwin Trilles.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of murder qualified by treachery under the Revised Penal Code. The information did **not** allege the use of an unlicensed firearm.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Testimony of Rosita and Anthony Trilles, eyewitnesses, identifying De Guzman as the shooter. Initial police reports stated the suspect was "unknown" but later explained as unknown by name only.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Alibi; De Guzman claimed to be at a party 3km away at the time of the killings, supported by testimonies of alibi witnesses.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of two counts of murder. Sentenced to death for each count. Ordered indemnity of P100,000 per case.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed conviction, but modified the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* for both counts. Reduced indemnity to P50,000 per victim.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Dennis de Guzman):** Found guilty and liable for *reclusion perpetua* and payment of indemnity for the deaths of Ernesto and Edwin Trilles.
*   **Co-Accused (Aringo and Casiban):** Warrants of arrest issued. Cases to be revived upon apprehension.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Eyewitness Identification:** Inconsistencies in initial police reports regarding identification posed a risk to the prosecution's case. The SC addressed this by citing *Jacobo v. Court of Appeals*, holding that testimonial evidence in court is superior to affidavits.
*   **Alibi:** De Guzman's alibi was deemed weak because the distance between his alleged location and the crime scene was short and traversed by well-trodden shortcuts.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Although the RTC deemed that firearms were used during the crime, the Supreme Court rejected the death sentence based on the information, which did not specify that an unlicensed firearm was used.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Murder qualified by treachery (Art. 14(16), RPC).
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Modifies provisions on heinous crimes, including the death penalty for murder under certain circumstances.
*   ***Jacobo v. Court of Appeals***: Established that testimonial evidence carries more weight than an affidavit, and with more reason police report.
*   ***Bautista v. Court of Appeals***: Held that positive identification of an accused prevails over alibi and denial.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial "unknown suspect" description in the police report created ambiguity. The prosecution had to clarify this through subsequent testimony and affidavits.
*   The lack of specific allegation of the use of an unlicensed firearm in the information resulted in the overturning of the death sentence.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the murder convictions based on the eyewitness testimony identifying De Guzman as the perpetrator. The Court, however, reduced the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* due to the absence of any aggravating circumstances, as proven in the trial. The case highlights the importance of accurate and detailed initial police reports and informations in criminal proceedings.
