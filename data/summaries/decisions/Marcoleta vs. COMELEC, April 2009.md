## Legal Document Summary: *Marcoleta v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 181377 & 181726)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for *certiorari* challenging COMELEC Resolutions concerning the rightful representative of the ALAGAD party-list in Congress.

**Key Issue:** Dispute between two factions (Marcoleta and Osabel) claiming leadership and representation of the ALAGAD party-list. Specifically, challenges against COMELEC's orders for a rehearing and suspension of a prior resolution.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 18, Sec. 6 (Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided):** When the COMELEC En Banc is equally divided or lacks the necessary majority, the case *shall* be reheard. If no decision is reached on rehearing, the original decision stands in appealed cases.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 3, Sec. 5(a) & Constitution, Art. IX-A, Sec. 7:** Majority vote requires a majority of *all* COMELEC members, not just those participating in deliberations. *Estrella v. Comelec* (G.R. No. 160465, May 27, 2004) cited, reinforcing this point.
*   The initial COMELEC En Banc Resolution reversing the First Division failed to achieve the required majority vote (4 out of 7 members).
*   **The Supreme Court found no grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC:** in ordering a rehearing to break the deadlock, or in suspending its prior resolution to allow for the rehearing.
*   **COMELEC's Power to Amend/Control its Processes:** The COMELEC has inherent power to amend or control its processes and orders before finality (*Sahali v. Comelec*, G.R. No. 134169, February 2, 2000). It can *motu proprio* reconsider resolutions under its control (*Jaafar v. Comelec*, G.R. No. 134188, March 15, 1999).
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 2, Sec. 3(g) & Rule 1, Sec. 4:** COMELEC has the authority to amend, control its processes, and even suspend its rules in the interest of justice and to obtain speedy disposition.

**Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC:** Obligated to conduct a rehearing of the controversy and render a decision consistent with its Rules of Procedure and relevant jurisprudence.
*   **ALAGAD factions:** Required to participate in the COMELEC's rehearing process.

**Liabilities:** None explicitly established in this decision. The case pertains to procedural issues within the COMELEC rather than establishing specific liabilities.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lengthy delay in resolving the ALAGAD representation dispute risked disenfranchisement of the party's constituents.
*   The Marcoleta group's initial filing of a petition with the Supreme Court before pursuing remedies within the COMELEC was procedurally incorrect.
*   Osabel's argument that a "majority of the quorum" sufficed for a decision was rejected based on COMELEC rules and jurisprudence.
*   Procedural lapses: The COMELEC's initial oversight in affirming the First Division Resolution without an actual rehearing, later rectified, could have created grounds for challenge had it not been corrected.
*   The COMELEC's reliance on Section 6, Rule 18, could be interpreted to mean that, *after* the rehearing, if the vote is still divided, the FIRST DIVISION ruling stands which, given the composition of the COMELEC during the hearings, might not be the "correct" or "just" result.

**Outcome:**

*   G.R. No. 181377 (Marcoleta group's petition) was dismissed as moot.
*   G.R. No. 181726 (Osabel group's petition) was dismissed for lack of merit.
*   The case was remanded to the COMELEC En Banc for rehearing.
