## Legal Document Summary: MBTC vs. De Koning (G.R. No. 157867)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the CA and RTC orders dismissing Metrobank's (MBTC) *ex parte* petition for a writ of possession.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 7:** This Act, as amended, governs extrajudicial foreclosure and the procedure for obtaining a writ of possession. The court reiterated that a writ of possession may issue (1) within the one-year redemption period upon filing of a bond, or (2) after the lapse of the redemption period, without a bond.

**Obligations:**

*   **Purchaser (MBTC):** To file a petition in the form of an *ex parte* motion in the registration or cadastral proceedings of the registered property to obtain a writ of possession.
*   **RTC:** To issue a writ of possession upon the filing of the proper motion and approval of the corresponding bond (if within the redemption period) or when the redemption period has expired. This is a ministerial duty.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Debtor (De Koning):** Liable to relinquish possession of the property after the redemption period lapses.
*   The filing of a bond, which is equivalent to the use of the property for a period of 12 months, protects the debtor in case it can be shown that the sale was made without violating the mortgage or the requirements of Act. No. 3135.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forum Shopping Certification:** The RTC and CA erroneously dismissed MBTC's petition based on a "false" certification against forum shopping. The SC clarified that an *ex parte* petition for a writ of possession is *not* an initiatory pleading asserting a claim; therefore, a certification against forum shopping is *not* required.
*   **Intervention in *Ex Parte* Proceedings:** De Koning was improperly allowed to intervene and file a motion to dismiss. The court confirms that the issuance of a writ of possession under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 is an *ex parte* proceeding, precluding intervention by the mortgagor.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act No. 4118):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure and the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Section 5:** This case clarifies that this rule (requiring certification against forum shopping) does not apply to *ex parte* motions for a writ of possession.
*   **Sps. Arquiza v. CA (498 Phil. 793 (2005)):** Reinforces that a petition for a writ of possession under Act No. 3135 is a motion, not an initiatory pleading, and therefore not subject to forum shopping requirements.
*   **Ancheta v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. (G.R. No. 163410):** A third party can not intervene in a petition for writ of possession.
*   **GSIS v. Court of Appeals:** Interventions in summary proceedings under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 are not appropriate.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention revolved around whether the petition for a writ of possession was an "initiatory pleading" requiring a certification against forum shopping. The SC clarified that it is not, resolving the ambiguity.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, holding that the *ex parte* petition for a writ of possession does not require a certification against forum shopping, and that the debtor should not have been allowed to intervene. The case was remanded to the RTC for proper disposition, affirming the ministerial duty to issue the writ.
