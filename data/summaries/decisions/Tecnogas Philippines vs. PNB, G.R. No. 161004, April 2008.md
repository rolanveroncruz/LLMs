**Case Summary: *Tecnogas Philippines Manufacturing Corporation vs. Philippine National Bank*, G.R. No. 161004, April 14, 2008**

**Facts:**

*   Tecnogas obtained loans from PNB secured by a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) over its property. The REM contained a dragnet clause securing all present and future obligations.
*   Tecnogas defaulted, and PNB initiated extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135.
*   Tecnogas filed a complaint to annul the foreclosure sale, seeking a TRO and preliminary injunction, which the RTC initially granted.
*   The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, finding grave abuse of discretion in granting the injunction. The CA held Tecnogas had no clear legal right to an injunctive relief because its unaccepted proposal to pay by *dacion en pago* did not extinguish its debt.
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage (REM):** Authorizes extrajudicial foreclosure and contains a dragnet clause securing all of Tecnogas's obligations to PNB.
*   **Dacion en Pago:** Tecnogas's proposal to satisfy the debt with property was rejected by PNB.

**Obligations:**

*   **Tecnogas:** Obligated to repay the loan to PNB per the loan agreement and subsequent restructurings.
*   **PNB:** Obligated to comply with Act No. 3135 regarding extrajudicial foreclosure, including notice and procedural requirements.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tecnogas:** Liable for the outstanding loan amount plus interest and penalties (P205,025,743.59 as of April 15, 2001). Subject to foreclosure of its mortgaged property.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Deficiency Judgment:** If the foreclosure sale does not fully satisfy the debt, PNB may pursue a deficiency judgment against Tecnogas.
*   **Annulment of Foreclosure:** If Tecnogas can prove procedural defects in the foreclosure process under Act No. 3135, the sale could be annulled.
*   **Indirect Contempt:** The Supreme Court pointed out that the preliminary injunction issued by the trial court remains valid until the decision of the Court of Appeals annulling the same attains finality, and violation thereof constitutes indirect contempt which, however, requires either a formal charge or a verified petition.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Act No. 3135:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Philippine Lawin Bus, Co. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 130972, January 23, 2002, 374 SCRA 332:** Defines *dacion en pago* as a sale where the creditor buys the debtor's property, payment for which is charged against the debt. Consent is required for the novation to occur, thereby extinguishing the debt.
*   **Tayag v. Lacson, G.R. No. 134971, March 25, 2004, 426 SCRA 282:**  Outlines requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction: a clear and unmistakable right, violation of that right, and urgent necessity to prevent serious damage.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 121251, June 26, 1998, 291 SCRA 271:** Details procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure of REM.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Dragnet Clause:** The breadth of the dragnet clause in the REM may be subject to interpretation regarding which obligations are truly secured by the mortgage. Although common, courts often scrutinize these clauses to ensure fairness and prevent overreach by the creditor.
*   **Validity of Foreclosure Proceedings:** The SC emphasized the trial court still needs to resolve issues of whether PNB observed the procedures prescribed by Act No. 3135 and whether Tecnogas suffered damage as a result of PNB's acts.

**Legal Analysis and Advice:**

*   The SC affirmed the appellate court finding that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in granting preliminary injunction because the proposal to pay by way of dacion en pago was not accepted by PNB; thus, it does not constitute a valid tender of payment.
*   The SC ruled that the foreclosure of REM did not render the case moot because the decision of the Court of Appeals annulling the grant of preliminary injunction in favor of Tecnogas has not yet become final on August 24, 2004.
*   Tecnogas will likely need to focus on proving procedural deficiencies in the foreclosure process under Act No. 3135 to obtain relief. They should also investigate whether there were any breaches of duty on the part of PNB.
