## Legal Document Summary: Macawiwili Gold Mining and Development Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Philex Mining Corporation

**Case:** G.R. No. 115104, October 12, 1998 (358 Phil. 245)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Macawiwili Gold Mining and Development Co., Inc. and Omico Mining & Industrial Corporation (Macawiwili & Omico)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals and Philex Mining Corporation (Philex)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Certiorari.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari filed by Macawiwili & Omico, setting aside the Court of Appeals' resolution that denied Macawiwili & Omico's motion to dismiss Philex's appeal from a trial court decision. The SC held that the Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion because Philex's appeal raised only questions of law, which should have been brought directly to the Supreme Court via petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, not to the CA via ordinary appeal.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Expropriation Complaint:** Philex filed a complaint for expropriation against Macawiwili & Omico based on Section 53 of P.D. No. 463, seeking to expropriate 21.9 hectares of their mining areas.
*   **Trial Court Dismissal:** The trial court dismissed Philex's complaint, citing the Supreme Court's decision in *Poe Mining Association vs. Garcia, 202 SCRA 222*, which upheld Macawiwili & Omico's possessory rights over the disputed mining claims. The trial court also viewed the expropriation attempt as forum-shopping, as it aimed to circumvent the Supreme Court's ruling.
*   **Auxiliary Mining Rights**: The trial court stated that since Section 59 of P.D. No. 463 falls under "Auxiliary Mining Rights," the right to expropriate is not an absolute one and should be construed strictly against the mining company. The trial court also opined that one mining company cannot expropriate the land belonging to another.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** The Court of Appeals denied Macawiwili & Omico's motion to dismiss the appeal.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court ruled that the issues raised in Philex's appeal concerned the *legal interpretation* of Section 59 of P.D. 463 (Eminent Domain of Mining Claims), specifically regarding the extent of the right to expropriate and whether it applies to land already subject to mining rights.  The Supreme Court also considered the proper application of rules of civil procedure in relation to special civil actions. Thus, they were purely questions of law. The Court noted the assignments of error in Philex's appeal before the CA hinged on the *existence of a right to expropriate* under the law.
*   **Rule 41, 42 & 45:** The SC referenced Rule 41 (Ordinary Appeal), Rule 42 (Appeal by Petition for Review) and Rule 45 (Appeal by Certiorari) of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (and the prior Supreme Court Circular No. 2-90).
*   **Forum Shopping:** The SC did not rule specifically on the matter of forum shopping but referenced it as a basis for the original dismissal.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration Exemption:** SC noted it was not required in this instance as similar arguments were previously raised and ruled upon by the lower courts.

**Statutory References:**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Interpretation of "Auxiliary Mining Rights" under P.D. 463:** The key legal question is whether Section 59 grants an *absolute* right to expropriate or only a *conditional/auxiliary* right, especially when another mining company already holds possessory rights. The SC decision hinges on *procedural law* related to the correct venue for appeals, and not on the merits of the eminent domain claim.
*   **Forum Shopping vs. Exercise of Legal Rights:** The trial court's finding of forum shopping, while cited, was not directly addressed by the Supreme Court in its final ruling.
*   **Expropriation of Land with Existing Mining Rights:** The SC did not express direct opinion on the trial court's conclusion that land already classified for mining operation cannot be further expropriated as this raises significant substantive law questions.
*   **Impact on Future Expropriation Cases:** The SC decision does not bar Philex's right to file future expropriation cases, provided they do not involve the same issues already ruled upon by the Supreme Court. However, the issue of whether said claim can validly be expropriated requires a resolution on the merits, in a court of proper jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Litigation:** Philex could potentially refile the expropriation complaint, ensuring that any subsequent appeal goes directly to the Supreme Court if only questions of law are raised.
*   **Enforcement of Poe Mining vs. Garcia:** Macawiwili & Omico can still assert their rights based on the original Poe Mining decision.
*   **Valuation of Property:** Even if expropriation is ultimately deemed permissible, determining just compensation remains a potential point of contention.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The immediate effect is that the trial court ruling dismissing the expropriation case stands.
*   Philex cannot appeal the trial court ruling in CA. It must either accept the ruling or appeal directly to SC via Petition for Review.

**Note:** This summary focuses on the legal issues and potential ramifications of the Supreme Court's decision. A more comprehensive assessment would require a deeper dive into the underlying factual context and specific mining rights involved.
