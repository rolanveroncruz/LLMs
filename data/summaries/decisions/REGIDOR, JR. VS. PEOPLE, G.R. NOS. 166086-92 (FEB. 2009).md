**Case Summary: *Eleno T. Regidor, Jr. vs. People of the Philippines***

**Citation:** 598 Phil. 714 (G.R. Nos. 166086-92, February 13, 2009)

**Parties:**
*   Petitioners: Eleno T. Regidor, Jr. (former City Mayor), Camilo B. Zapatos (former Sangguniang Panglungsod Member)
*   Respondent: People of the Philippines

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Third Division)

**Issue:** Whether petitioners are guilty beyond reasonable doubt of falsification of public documents under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Petitioners, along with others, were charged with falsification of public documents for making it appear that certain resolutions were deliberated upon and approved by the Sangguniang Panglungsod when they allegedly were not. The Sandiganbayan convicted Petitioners. Prosecution witnesses testified that resolutions were not deliberated upon while defence argued otherwise. The resolutions included salary increases, budget approvals, and a request for appointment. Several private complainants submitted an affidavit of desistance.
The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's decision.

**Holding:** Petitioners were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of falsification of public documents under Article 171, paragraphs 2 and 7 of the Revised Penal Code. Petitioners were sentenced with an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment from TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of Prision Correccional medium as the minimum penalty to EIGHT (8) YEARS of Prision Mayor minimum as the maximum penalty and to each pay a FINE of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00).

**Key Provisions & Elements of the Offense (Art. 171 RPC):**

*   **Art. 171, RPC: Falsification by Public Officer:** Defines the crime of falsification of public documents by public officials.
*   **Elements:**
    1.  Offender is a public officer.
    2.  Offender takes advantage of official position.
    3.  Offender falsifies a document by:
        *   Causing it to appear that persons participated in an act when they did not (Art. 171, par. 2).
        *   Issuing in authenticated form a document purporting to be a copy when no such original exists (Art. 171, par. 7).
*   **Note:** Intent to gain or injure is not required, as the violation is against public faith.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
* Public Officers: Have a duty to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness of public documents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 171:** Defines falsification of public documents.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, Section 180 (Local Government Code of 1983):** Defines the City Mayor’s power to veto ordinances and resolutions.
*   **De los Reyes v. Sandiganbayan, Third Division, G.R. No. 121215, November 13, 1997, 281 SCRA 631:** Importance of minutes and mayor’s role in approving resolutions.
*   **Balderama v. People:** Affidavits of desistance viewed with suspicion.
*   **Lastrilla v. Granda, G.R. No. 160257, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 324:** In falsification of public/official documents, idea of gain is not necessary

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accuracy of Minutes:** The petitioners contested the accuracy of the minutes of the Sanggunian meetings, claiming they did not reflect the deliberations on the resolutions.
*   **Affidavits of Desistance:** The existence of affidavits of desistance from the complainants created an initial ambiguity regarding the validity of the claims.
*   **Good Faith Argument:** The petitioners attempted to claim good faith, asserting they relied on the certifications of others; This was rejected because their positions imposed upon them a duty to independently ensure accuracy.
*  The dissenters raised questions over whether they have a conflict of interest because of their position as the presiding officers.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Public officials have a high duty to ensure the veracity of public documents. Lack of specific intent to gain is irrelevant if falsification is proven.
*   The Supreme Court affords significant weight to the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, particularly regarding witness credibility.
*   Affidavits of desistance should be viewed with suspicion and should be examined accordingly.
*   Reliance on the defence of good faith of the accused is immaterial.
