**Legal Document Summary: *Glorito V. Maturan vs. Atty. Conrado S. Gonzales* (A.C. No. 2597)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer (Atty. Conrado S. Gonzales) for representing conflicting interests.

**Key Provision:** Respondent Atty. Gonzales, after representing Maturan in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 1783-11) based on an SPA prepared and notarized by him, subsequently represented the opposing party (Yokingco et al.) in actions seeking to annul a related judgment (Civil Case No. 2067) and in an injunction case (Special Civil Case No. 161) against Maturan.

**Obligations Violated:** Atty. Gonzales violated Canon 6 of the Canons of Professional Ethics (now superseded by similar provisions in the Code of Professional Responsibility), specifically the prohibition against representing conflicting interests. He breached the fiduciary duty owed to his former client, Maturan.

**Liabilities:** The Supreme Court imposed a *two-year suspension* from the practice of law on Atty. Gonzales. This modifies the IBP's recommendation of a one-year suspension.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Termination of Lawyer-Client Relationship:** Atty. Gonzales' argument that filing a motion for execution terminated the lawyer-client relationship was rejected. The Court emphasized that representation continues until the conclusion of the case.
*   **Lack of Malice:** While Atty. Gonzales argued good faith, the Court held that good faith does not negate the prohibition against representing conflicting interests.
*   **Definition of Conflicting Interests:** The Court cited *U.S. vs. Laranja, 21 Phil. 500 (1912)* to reinforce the attorney-client privilege and duty of confidentiality. The potential for the lawyer to use information obtained from the former client against them in the subsequent representation is the core issue.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **Canon 6 of the Canons of Professional Ethics:**  Prohibits representing conflicting interests, except with express consent after full disclosure.
*   **Rule 15.03, Code of Professional Responsibility (cited in AGPALO, LEGAL ETHICS (1992), p. 219):**  Lawyer shall not represent conflicting interests.
*   ***Vda. De Alisbo vs. Jalandoon, Sr., 199 SCRA 321 (1991)***: Suspended a lawyer for two years for representing a complainant in a case for revival of judgment, when he had been the counsel of the adverse party in the case sought to be revived.
*   ***Bautista vs. Barrios, 9 SCRA 695 (1963)***: Two-year suspension imposed for drafting a deed of partition for one party and later representing the other party in its enforcement.
*   ***PNB vs. Cedo, 243 SCRA 1 (1995)***: Three-year suspension for representing conflicting interests and deliberately attracting clients adverse to a former employer.
*   ***Natan vs. Capule, 91 Phil. 647 (1952)***:  Two-year suspension for accepting professional employment in a case where his former client was the adverse party.
*   ***U.S. vs. Laranja, 21 Phil. 500 (1912)***: Reinforces the attorney-client privilege and the rationale behind prohibiting conflicting interests based on the potential for abuse of confidential information.

**Analysis/Advice:**  Atty. Gonzales clearly violated ethical rules by representing conflicting interests. The two-year suspension is consistent with precedent. There is no ambiguity on the facts or the law and Gonzales' attempt to justify his action by stating that his withdrawal of representation was unnecessary in order to sever the lawyer-client relationship between them and his representation of Yokingco et al. was for him, an opportunity to honestly earn a little more for his children's sustenance was not justified, such justification revealed a patent ignorance of the fiduciary obligations which a lawyer owes to his client.
