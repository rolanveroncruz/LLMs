## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Olorga vs. Judge Beldia, Jr.*

**Case:** A.M. No. RTJ-08-2137, *Heirs of Spouses Jose and Concepcion Olorga vs. Judge Rolindo D. Beldia, Jr., et al.*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint for infidelity in the custody of records and negligence.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Allegations:** Complainants (heirs of Olorga) alleged loss of records in Civil Case No. X-82 (specific performance) while in the custody of respondents Judge Beldia, Jr. and Branch Clerk of Court Villanueva, resulting in inability to prove full payment for property. Further, allegations of failure to decide the case within the mandated time.
*   **Judge Beldia's Defense:** Denied the charges, stating he was reassigned multiple times, the records remained with the court, Civil Case No. X-82 was not among the cases in the inventory he signed, and the audits did not flag it as pending for too long. Blaming termites.
*   **Clerk Villanueva's Defense:** Assumed office long after the records were lost. She was not remiss in her duties.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court found Judge Beldia *GUILTY of simple misconduct* for failing to ensure docket book entries were updated, violating Rules 3.08 and 3.09 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. He was fined P15,000 to be deducted from his retirement benefits and severely reprimanded for violating Canons 1, 11 and 12 of the CPR. The complaint against Clerk Villanueva was *DISMISSED.*
*   **Rationale:** The court rejected the infidelity charge due to lack of evidence linking the loss directly to either respondent. The court found the judge negligent in his administrative duties concerning the court's docketing practices. It was proven Civil Case No. X-82 was submitted for decision during his time.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *In Re: Cases Left Undecided by Judge Sergio D. Mabunay* (A.M. No. 98-3-114-RTC) establishes procedures for case assignment when judges are transferred. This case was invoked to address who had responsibility over the case files for Civil Case No. X-82.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Beldia:** Duty to diligently discharge administrative responsibilities (Rule 3.08, Code of Judicial Conduct), supervise court personnel (Rule 3.09, Code of Judicial Conduct), and ensure prompt and efficient dispatch of business. He failed to do so by not ensuring docket entries were updated. Subject to fine of P15,000.
*   **Clerk Villanueva:** Duty to safely keep all records (Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court). However, she was relieved of liability as the documents were missing before her tenure.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The testimony regarding the P300 payment for a messenger was uncorroborated, questioning its reliability.
*   **Missing Records Reconstruction:** The court suggested reconstructing the records of the case to the complainants.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The charges were brought against the respondent judge after their compulsory retirement. It was determined this did not render the proceedings moot.
