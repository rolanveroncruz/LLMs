## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Comprado* (G.R. No. 213225, April 4, 2018)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Renante Comprado y Bronola of illegal possession of marijuana under Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The Court ruled that the warrantless search and seizure conducted by the police were unlawful, rendering the seized marijuana inadmissible as evidence.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Accusation:** Comprado was charged with illegal possession of 3,200 grams of marijuana.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Based on a confidential informant's tip, police set up a checkpoint, stopped a bus, and searched Comprado's bag, finding marijuana.
*   **Defense's Version:** Comprado claimed he was merely asked to transport the bag and was arrested in a different location.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of illegal possession.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC; held the search was valid as a search of a moving vehicle, and non-compliance with Section 21, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 was not fatal.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed CA.

**Key Legal Issues & Rationale:**

*   **Validity of Arrest:** The Court found the warrantless arrest invalid because it did not fall under any of the exceptions outlined in Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure (in flagrante delicto or hot pursuit). Comprado did not exhibit any overt act indicating he committed a crime in the presence of the officers *without* the informant's tip.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The marijuana was deemed inadmissible as it was obtained through an illegal search, violating Comprado's right against unreasonable search and seizure (Article III, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution). The "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine applies.
*   **"Stop and Frisk" vs. Search Incidental to Lawful Arrest:** The Court distinguished between the two.  No valid "stop and frisk" justification existed because there were no suspicious circumstances or overt acts that warranted the belief Comprado was armed or dangerous, distinguishing this case from *Posadas v. CA*, *Manalili v. CA*, and *People v. Solayao*.  Cited *People v. Cogaed* and *People v. Aruta* as analogous cases where no valid "stop and frisk" existed.
*   **Search of a Moving Vehicle:** The Court held the search did *not* qualify as a valid search of a moving vehicle. It stated the target of the search was Comprado, not the vehicle itself or its cargo.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Nuevas*: Inadmissibility of evidence obtained through an illegal search.
*   *Malacat v. CA*: Distinguishes search incidental to lawful arrest and "stop-and-frisk".
*   *Posadas v. CA*, *Manalili v. CA*, *People v. Solayao*: Examples of valid "stop-and-frisk" searches.
*   *People v. Cogaed*, *People v. Aruta*, *People v. Aminnudin*, *People v. Chua*, *Sanchez v. People*: Examples of illegal "stop-and-frisk" searches.
*   *Esquillo v. People*: Discussion of "seemingly innocent activity" requiring more than one such activity to warrant inference of criminal activity.
*   *People v. Racho*: Waiver of illegal arrest does not waive inadmissibility of illegally seized evidence.
*   *Comerciante v. People*: Fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.
*   *People v. Libnao*: Probable cause in searches of a moving vehicle

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights the risk of relying solely on confidential informants without independent corroboration of criminal activity.
*   Over-reliance on the "search of a moving vehicle" exception without establishing probable cause or direct connection of vehicle to transport of illegal items.
*   Lack of clear and consistent guidelines for police officers on the application of "stop-and-frisk" doctrine and its distinction from other types of searches.
*   The dissent in *Esquillo v. People*, cited by the court, provides an emphasis that there needs to be multiple "innocent activities" to infer criminal activity; however this is a grey area, open for interpretation by other judges/cases.

**Implications:**

The *Comprado* case reinforces the importance of upholding constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, even in the context of drug enforcement. It serves as a reminder for law enforcement to adhere to established legal procedures and to avoid relying solely on unverified information when conducting arrests and searches. The case clarifies the narrow scope of the "search of a moving vehicle" exception.
