## Legal Document Summary: People v. Espinosa, G.R. No. 228877

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Dominador Espinosa y Pansoy*

**Citation:** 839 Phil. 371 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant for Parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions/Elements of Parricide:**

*   (1) A person is killed; (2) The deceased is killed by the accused; (3) The deceased is the father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or a legitimate other ascendant or other descendant, or the legitimate spouse of the accused (LUIS B. REYES, The Revised Penal Code, 2006 Edition, Book II, p. 457).

**Facts:** The accused, Dominador Espinosa, was convicted of parricide for the death of his six-month-old child. The prosecution presented evidence that the child sustained traumatic injuries inconsistent with the accused's claim of accidental death due to falling from a cradle. Circumstantial evidence included injuries (hematomas, cigarette burns) and the medical expert's testimony.

**Court's Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused's Liability:** Conviction for parricide under Art. 246 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment).
*   **Damages Payable to Heirs:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00 (increased from lower court).
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00 (increased from lower court).
    *   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Temperate Damages: P50,000.00.
    *   Legal Interest: 6% per annum on all monetary awards from finality of judgment until fully paid, citing *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267 (2013).*

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Lack of direct evidence requires meticulous scrutiny of each circumstance and its probative value. *People v. Calonge, 637 Phil. 435, 453 (2010)*
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Medina's testimony regarding neighbor's statements was deemed unprobative, however, the testimonies of the neighbors were taken under oath, this could be grounds for challenge.
*   **Accident Defense:** The accused claimed the death was accidental. The court rejected this defense based on medical evidence contradicting the claim and the injuries inflicted upon the victim.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes parricide.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7659:** Amended Article 246 RPC, setting the penalty for parricide.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346, Section 3:** Prohibits parole for those sentenced to reclusion perpetua.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Prevailing jurisprudence on the proper amounts of damages in parricide cases.

**Ambiguities/Areas for Potential Challenge:**

*   The weight given to the expert testimony, specifically if the expert adequately considered alternative explanations for the injuries, given that no direct evidence of the act exists.
*   The totality of the evidence proving the accused was the one who inflicted the injuries.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

*The *People v. Espinosa* case involves a parricide conviction based on circumstantial evidence. Key elements of parricide under Article 246 RPC were met. The conviction hinged on the implausibility of the accused's accident defense given the medical evidence presented, as well as the lack of other suspects. The primary risks are the lack of direct evidence and reliance on expert testimony that could be challenged. The Court affirmed the lower court's decision, increasing the awarded damages to reflect current jurisprudence. Focus on the expert witness testimony and potential alternative explanations for the injuries, and the hearsay testimony for any future proceedings, while considering relevant jurisprudence regarding circumstantial evidence for parricide convictions.*
