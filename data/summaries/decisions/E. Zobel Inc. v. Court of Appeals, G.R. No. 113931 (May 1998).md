## Legal Document Summary: E. Zobel, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.

**Citation:** 352 Phil. 608 (G.R. No. 113931, May 06, 1998)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the denial of a Motion to Dismiss.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Continuing Guaranty Contract:** The central issue revolves around a "Continuing Guaranty" executed by E. Zobel, Inc. (Petitioner) in favor of Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation (SOLIDBANK) to secure a loan granted to Spouses Raul and Elea Claveria.
*   **Default on Loan:** The Spouses Claveria defaulted on their loan obligation to SOLIDBANK.
*   **Article 2080, Civil Code:** Petitioner invoked Article 2080 of the Civil Code, arguing that SOLIDBANK's failure to register the chattel mortgage extinguished its liability as a guarantor due to the loss of its right to subrogation.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (E. Zobel, Inc.):** Found liable by the Court as a **surety**, not a guarantor, based on the wording and intention of the "Continuing Guaranty" contract. The contract indicated a direct and primary obligation to SOLIDBANK, co-extensive with the debtor's.
*   **SOLIDBANK:** As creditor, the bank sought to recover the unpaid loan amount from the principal debtors (Spouses Claveria) and the surety (E. Zobel, Inc.).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Surety vs. Guarantor:** The core legal debate centered on whether the contract constituted a guarantee or a surety agreement. The court emphasized the importance of interpreting the contract as a whole and looking at the intention of the parties, not just the title.
*   **Waiver of Rights:** The "Continuing Guaranty" contained clauses where the Petitioner waived several rights, including the benefit of division (Art. 1837) and expressly agreed to be bound irrespective of any collateral or its condition. This potentially weakens Zobel's defenses.
*   **Effect of Non-Registration:** The Petitioner argued that the failure of SOLIDBANK to register the chattel mortgage (additional security) with the appropriate government agency prejudiced its right of subrogation under Article 2080, Civil Code. The Court rejected this, saying even if Art. 2080 applied, the contract expressly waived the rights regarding collaterals and negligence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2080, Civil Code:** This article pertains to the release of guarantors when they cannot be subrogated to the creditor's rights. The Court held that it's inapplicable because the contract was deemed a suretyship, not a guarantee.
*   **Distinction between Guaranty and Surety:** The Court extensively discussed the distinction between a guarantor (insurer of solvency) and a surety (insurer of debt), citing *Bouvier's Law Dictionary* and *Machetti vs. Hospicio, 43 Phil. 297.*
*   **Bicol Savings and Loan Association vs. Guinhawa, 188 SCRA 647:** Cited as precedent for the principle that Article 2080 does not apply to sureties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The use of the term "guarantee" in the contract title while the content indicated a suretyship was a point of contention. The Court ultimately prioritized the substance of the agreement over its title.
*   The waiver clauses within the "Continuing Guaranty" were crucial in determining Zobel's liability.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding E. Zobel, Inc. liable as a surety for the loan obligation of the Spouses Claveria. The Court emphasized the contract's language, which established a direct and primary obligation, and the waiver clauses that prevented the surety from being discharged due to the creditor's inaction or negligence regarding collateral. Zobel's defense based on Article 2080 was deemed inapplicable given its role as a surety.
