**Case Summary: *Tsuneishi Heavy Industries (Cebu), Inc. v. MIS Maritime Corporation***

**Court & Date:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, G.R. No. 193572, April 4, 2018.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, holding that Tsuneishi failed to comply with the requirements for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment against MIS. The maritime lien under Sec. 21 of the Ship Mortgage Decree can be enforced by filing an *in rem* action, and a writ of preliminary attachment under Rule 57 is not the sole means of enforcement.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Ship Mortgage Decree, Sec. 21:** Grants a maritime lien to any person furnishing repairs, supplies, towage, use of dry dock or marine railway, or other necessaries to any vessel, enforceable by a suit *in rem*.
*   **Contract between Tsuneishi & MIS:** Granted Tsuneishi a right to take possession, control, and custody of the vessel upon default in payment, including the right to dispose of the vessel to satisfy unpaid bills. (However this does not remove need to follow proper court procedures)
*   **MIS' Obligation:** Payment for repair and dry docking services provided by Tsuneishi.
*   **Tsuneishi's Obligation:** Proper services for MIS, with resulting responsibilities for any damages related to negligence or improper handling of the vessel.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Tsuneishi's Liability:** Potential liability for damages to the vessel M/T MIS-1's engine and resulting loss of revenue to MIS due to negligence.
*   **MIS' Liability:** Potential liability for unpaid repair and dry docking services. However this is dependant on the proper assertion of claims of fraud or improper practice.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The contract's provision granting Tsuneishi the right to take possession and dispose of the vessel in case of default, *without resorting to court action*, is problematic and likely unenforceable to the extent it bypasses due process.
*   Ambiguity exists regarding the allocation of risk for engine damage occurring *after* dry docking but *before* sea trials, specifically, whether it falls under the shipowner's (MIS) or the shipyard's (Tsuneishi) responsibility.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Ship Mortgage Decree (PD 1521), Sec. 21:** Foundation for the maritime lien claim.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 57:** Governs the issuance of writs of preliminary attachment.
*   **Republic v. Mega Pacific eSolutions (2016):** Outlines the purpose of a writ of preliminary attachment.
*   **Quasha Asperilla Ancheta Valmonte Pe√±a & Marcos v. Juan (1982):** Establishes that a pre-existing lien is equivalent to an attachment.
* **Metro, Inc. v. Lara's Gifts and Decors, Inc. (2009):** Provides context on the factual circumstances required to establish fraud.
*   **PCL Industries Manufacturing Corporation v. Court of Appeals (2006):** Failure to pay alone doesn't establish fraud.
*   **Watercraft Venture Corporation v. Wolfe (2015):** An affidavit lacking specific fraud allegations is inadequate to sustain the writ.

**Key Issues & Arguments:**

*   **Enforcement of Maritime Lien:** Tsuneishi argued that Rule 57 is the proper procedure to enforce a maritime lien under the Ship Mortgage Decree and the maritime character of the action should be considered.  The Court disagreed, stating that the proper procedure is to file an action *in rem* in court.
*   **Compliance with Rule 57:** The CA and SC found that Tsuneishi failed to comply with Rule 57 requirements, specifically, the Bitera Affidavit did not state that MIS had no other sufficient security for the claim. Also, the fraud asserted in the Bitera Affidavit was too general.
*   **Fraud:** Tsuneishi argued that MIS' refusal to pay constituted fraud, while MIS contended it was withholding payment due to damages caused by Tsuneishi. The Court sided with MIS, finding no evidence of fraud to justify the writ of attachment.

**Risks & Recommendations for Counsel:**

*   **Incorrect Procedure:** Tsuneishi's attempt to enforce a maritime lien through a writ of preliminary attachment under Rule 57, rather than an *in rem* action, was procedurally flawed and ultimately unsuccessful.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of Fraud:** Tsuneishi failed to establish the factual circumstances of fraud with sufficient particularity, as required by jurisprudence and the Rules of Court.
*   **Strict Construction of Attachment Rules:** Courts strictly construe rules on preliminary attachment, and any non-compliance with the requirements is fatal.

**Recommendations:**

*   Counsel should advise Tsuneishi to initiate or continue with an *in rem* action to enforce the maritime lien under the Ship Mortgage Decree, focusing on proving the debt and the existence of the lien.
*   Counsel should assess the viability of Tsuneishi's claims and counterclaims related to the engine damage and loss of revenue, and prepare to defend against MIS' claims of negligence.
*   The contract needs to be re-drafted to remove the ambiguous clauses and make it fit in the bounds of what is allowed by law.
