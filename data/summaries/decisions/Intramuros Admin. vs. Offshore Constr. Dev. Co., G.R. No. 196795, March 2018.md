## Legal Document Summary: *Intramuros Administration v. Offshore Construction Development Company* (G.R. No. 196795)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the dismissal of an ejectment complaint filed by Intramuros Administration (IA) against Offshore Construction Development Company (OCDC).

**Key Issue:** Whether the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) had jurisdiction over the ejectment complaint and whether IA committed forum shopping.

**Background:**

*   1998: IA leased properties to OCDC (Baluarte De San Andres, Baluarte De San Francisco De Dilao, Revellin De Recoletos) under 5-year leases, renewable by mutual agreement.
*   OCDC introduced improvements, halted due to non-compliance with Presidential Decree No. 1616.
*   Civil Case No. 98-91587: OCDC filed a complaint against IA, settled through a Compromise Agreement (approved February 8, 2000), modifying the occupied areas but retaining the original lease period, terminating the Revellin De Recoletos lease.
*   OCDC allegedly failed to pay utility bills and rentals. As of December 31, 2009, arrears amounted to P13,448,867.45.
*   IA filed an ejectment complaint in 2010.

**MTC Ruling:**

*   Dismissed the complaint for forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction.
*   Forum shopping: IA failed to disclose Civil Case No. 08-119138 (OCDC vs. IA for specific performance) and SP CA No. 10-123257 (Interpleader filed by 4H Intramuros, OCDC's sublessees).
*   Lack of Jurisdiction: Relationship was a concession, not merely lessor-lessee.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Affirmed the MTC decision.

**Supreme Court Ruling (Reversed):**

*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** IA should have filed a petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals, not directly with the Supreme Court under Rule 45. However, due to the exigency of the situation (prolonged litigation) and because the issues raised are questions of law, direct resort to the Supreme Court is warranted.
*   **Jurisdiction:** MTC had jurisdiction. Allegations in the complaint established an unlawful detainer case: possession by contract/tolerance, termination of right of possession, continued possession, and filing within one year of the last demand. Defendant's defenses (concession agreement) don't affect the court's jurisdiction (citing *Morta v. Occidental*).
*   **Forum Shopping:** IA did not commit forum shopping. While the parties are the same, the rights asserted and reliefs prayed for are different. A judgment in the specific performance or interpleader case would not amount to *res judicata* in the ejectment case. The MOA of 2004 (basis of the specific performance case) only covered arrears up to July 31, 2004, not future rights of possession.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Contracts of Lease:** Established the lessor-lessee relationship, 5-year lease term, and obligations for rental payments.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** Modified the leased areas.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):** Addressed rental arrears as of July 31, 2004, through offsetting with DOT expenses.

**Liabilities:**

*   OCDC's liability for unpaid rentals and the obligation to vacate the premises.
*   Potential liability for unjust enrichment if IA recovers unpaid rentals in both the ejectment and specific performance cases.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Concession" vs. Lease:** OCDC's argument regarding a concession agreement is refuted, but the extensive improvements made by OCDC could potentially be a source of future disputes.
*   **Unpaid Rentals:** The amount of unpaid rentals is still in dispute and is being litigated in Civil Case No. 08-119138. Resolution dependent on DOT expenses offsetting and back rentals.
*   **Sublessees:** Rights of 4H Intramuros (sublessees) depend on OCDC's rights and are extinguished by the ejectment order.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1616 (Intramuros architecture requirements).
*   Rules of Court, Rule 42 and 45 (Appeals).
*   Civil Code, Articles 1643 (Lease of Things), 1670 (Tacita Reconduccion), and 1687 (Period for Lease).
*   *Morta v. Occidental* (jurisdiction determined by complaint allegations).
*   *Spouses Reyes v. Spouses Chung* (elements of forum shopping).
*   *Ca√±iza v. Court of Appeals* (possession by tolerance).

**Outcome:**

*   Petition for Review granted. RTC decision reversed.
*   OCDC and its sublessees ordered to vacate the premises immediately.
*   RTC Manila directed to resolve Civil Case No. 08-119138 (specific performance) with dispatch.
