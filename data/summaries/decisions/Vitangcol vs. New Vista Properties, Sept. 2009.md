**Legal Document Summary: Vitangcol v. New Vista Properties, Inc. (G.R. No. 176014)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC order dismissing New Vista's Quieting of Title action.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Alice Vitangcol and Norberto Vitangcol (Vitangcol)
*   **Respondents:** New Vista Properties, Inc. (New Vista), Maria Alipit, Register of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Dispute over Lot 1702:** The core issue is ownership of Lot No. 1702 covered by TCT No. (25311) 2528. New Vista claims prior ownership based on a 1989 Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Milagros A. De Guzman, acting as attorney-in-fact for Maria and Clemente Alipit. Vitangcol claims ownership based on a 2001 Deed of Absolute Sale from Maria Alipit, resulting in TCT No. T-482731.
*   **Special Power of Attorney (SPA) Discrepancy:** The SPA granted to De Guzman authorized her to sell Lot No. 1735 covered by TCT No. (25311) 2538, creating a discrepancy with the 1989 Deed that conveyed Lot 1702.
*   **New Vista's Possession & Actions:** New Vista took possession in 1989, fenced the property, and paid taxes, but failed to register the transfer due to reclassification issues. They filed an adverse claim and a suit for quieting of title when Vitangcol claimed ownership.
*   **Ratification Argument:** New Vista argues that the Alipits ratified the sale of Lot 1702 by accepting payments, delivering possession, and failing to challenge the sale for over a decade. The Court cites these arguments in its decision to allow the amended complaint to continue.
*   **Two TCTs for Lot 1702:** The court makes a note that there are two TCT's for Lot 1702, one with Maria Alipit and Clemente Alipit as owners, and one with just Maria Alipit, showing fraudulent conduct.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** Subsequent to the CA decision, the parties filed a compromise agreement before the RTC.

**Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Failure to State a Cause of Action:** The RTC initially dismissed the complaint, arguing failure to state a cause of action due to the SPA discrepancy and New Vista's failure to attach the SPA to their amended complaint.
*   **Amended Complaint Supersedes Original:** The CA correctly held that the Amended Complaint superseded the original complaint, and that the SPA was only submitted after the original complaint.
*   **Hypothetical Admission & Sufficiency of Allegations:** The Supreme Court reiterates the principle that, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the court hypothetically admits the truth of the complaint's allegations.
*   **Ratification as a Cure:** The Supreme Court held that even if the SPA had discrepancies, the allegations of ratification by the Alipits (acceptance of payments, delivery of possession) could cure the defect and support New Vista's cause of action.
*   **Fraudulent TCT:** The fact that there was a sale of the same Lot to Vitangcol with a TCT only listing Maria Alipit as the sole owner, is a fraudulent act since Clemente Alipit was also a registered owner.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governing petitions for review.
*   **Rule 16, Sec. 1(g), Rules of Court:** Allows dismissal for failure to state a cause of action.
*   **Rule 8, Sec. 7 of the Rules of Court:** States that an amended pleading supersedes the original pleading
*   **Balanay v. Paderanga, G.R. No. 136963, August 28, 2006:** Defines "cause of action."
*   **World Wide Ins. & Surety Co., Inc. v. Manuel, 98 Phil. 47 (1955):** Discrepancies in documents are evidentiary matters.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **SPA Validity:** The SPA discrepancy initially posed a risk to New Vista's claim. The ultimate validity and effect of the SPA remains ambiguous until evidence is presented during trial.
*   **Title Fraud:** The existence of two titles creates an issue on whether the one used by Maria Alipit was bogus.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** The parties' reported compromise agreement introduces the risk of a settlement being reached that is unfavorable to one party or unenforceable.
*   **Statute of Frauds:** Mentioned, but seemingly not a major issue given the allegations of payment and possession.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court DENIED the Vitangcol's petition, reinstating New Vista's complaint. However, the case was remanded to the RTC for action on the parties' submitted Compromise Agreement.
