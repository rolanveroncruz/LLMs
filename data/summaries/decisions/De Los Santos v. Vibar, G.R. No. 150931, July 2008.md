**Case Summary: *Dr. Cecilia De Los Santos v. Dr. Priscila Bautista Vibar*, G.R. No. 150931 (2008)**

**Subject:** Guaranty, Estoppel, Promissory Note Interpretation

**Facts:**

*   Priscila (Lender) extended a loan to Jose de Leon (Borrower), with Cecilia initially acting as a guarantor for a smaller, previous loan.
*   A second loan of P500,000 was extended.  De Leon handwrote "guarantor" next to Cecilia's signature on the promissory note, purportedly with Cecilia's consent (nodding her head).  The note also included a mortgage provision on a Baguio property (TCT No. T-47375).
*   De Leon defaulted. Priscila sued both De Leon and Cecilia for recovery of the debt.

**Issue:**

*   Is Cecilia liable as a guarantor of de Leon's P500,000 loan?

**Holding:**

*   Yes. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, holding Cecilia liable as guarantor.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Guaranty:** The central issue revolves around the validity of the guaranty agreement. The SC found that Cecilia consented to act as a guarantor based on her actions (nodding her head) when the word "guarantor" was added to the promissory note.
*   **Promissory Note:** The note details the loan amount (P500,000), interest rate (3% per month), and penalty for default (2% per month).  The handwritten insertion of "guarantor" next to Cecilia's name is pivotal.
*   **Mortgage Security:** The promissory note states that TCT No. T-47375 is being submitted by way of mortgage. This could create secured credit, but with the caveat that the validity and enforceability of the mortgage were not the primary issues addressed in this case, only the personal guarantee.

**Liabilities:**

*   **De Leon (Borrower):** Liable for the principal loan amount (P500,000) plus interest and penalties as per the promissory note. Also liable for moral damages and attorney's fees.
*   **Cecilia (Guarantor):** Secondarily liable for de Leon's debt if De Leon fails to pay.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Consent:** The primary contention is the nature of Cecilia's consent. Her "nodding head" and subsequent silence are interpreted as implied consent to the guaranty. This raises questions of subjective intent and whether such nonverbal cues are sufficient to establish a binding agreement.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule & Interpretation of Contract:**  While the promissory note itself is written, the key element (the word "guarantor" and the circumstances surrounding its addition) requires reliance on parol evidence to prove Cecilia's consent.
*   **Enforceability of the Mortgage:**  While mentioned, the enforceability of the mortgage on TCT No. T-47375 is not the primary issue. Further investigation is needed regarding the validity of the mortgage and ownership of the property. Note that the Register of Deeds initially denied the registration of Priscila's adverse claim.
*   **Estoppel in Pais:** The court invokes the doctrine of estoppel, arguing that Cecilia's actions (nodding, partial payment, letter to the Register of Deeds) prevent her from denying her role as guarantor.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article on Guaranty (Civil Code of the Philippines):** Implies a review on the specifics required for a legal and valid guaranty. The court implies the Civil Code requirement that a contract of guaranty is not presumed.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Cited regarding the adverse claim on the property. Sec. 70, specifically.
*   **Rule 130, Section 15 of the Rules of Court:** Written words prevail over printed words in an instrument.
*   **Case law on Estoppel:** The decision references general principles of estoppel *in pais*, preventing a party from adopting an inconsistent position.

**Key Takeaways & Concerns:**

*   The case highlights the importance of clear and explicit consent in contracts of guaranty. Ambiguous actions can be interpreted as consent, leading to unintended liability.
*   The decision demonstrates the application of estoppel in preventing a party from denying a previously asserted position, even if the initial agreement lacked explicit formality.
*   The enforceability of the mortgage mentioned in the note requires separate scrutiny, as it was not fully adjudicated in this case.
