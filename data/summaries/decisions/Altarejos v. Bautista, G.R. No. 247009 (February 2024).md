## Legal Document Summary: Altarejos vs. Bautista, G.R. No. 247009 (2024)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's ruling that the Quezon City Mayor had the authority to summarily evict occupants and demolish structures on a privately owned property.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992) & Local Government Code (LGC):** These laws are central. The decision clarifies that while RA 7279 empowers local chief executives to issue demolition/eviction orders without court intervention, this power is limited. LGC Sec. 455(b)(3)(vi) grants mayors power to order demolition of *illegally* constructed structures.
*   **Quezon City Ordinance No. SP-1800:** Regulates building construction/demolition. The decision emphasizes that the *Building Official*, not the Mayor directly, has the authority to declare structures dangerous and order their demolition.
*   **Distinction between Ejectment and Demolition Power:** The Court reiterated that an ejectment case concerns *possession*, while the administrative power to demolish stems from police power to address illegally constructed or dangerous structures. A dismissed ejectment action doesn't automatically preclude a demolition order.
*   **Due Process in Demolition/Eviction:** RA 7279, IRR and jurisprudence requires specific procedures (notice, consultations, relocation, etc.) for eviction/demolition, particularly concerning underprivileged citizens. *Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap, Inc. v. Robredo* (2014) provides a clear restatement of the requirements for the execution of eviction or demolition orders involving underprivileged and homeless citizens.
* **Writ of Prohibition:** The court determined that the lower courts erred when denying the Writ of Prohibition. The supreme court held that the lower court hastily made this determination, in light of documented administrative relief efforts on the part of the petitioning occupants and the irreparable damage they would have faced as a result of the Memorandum and Notice of Demolition.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability for Illegal Demolition:** If a demolition order is issued without proper legal basis (e.g., exceeding statutory authority, failure to follow due process), the LGU and its officials may be liable for damages.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Supreme Court found that the Quezon City Mayor acted with grave abuse of discretion by ordering the demolition.
*   **Potential for Violation of Constitutional Rights:** Summary evictions/demolitions without due process can violate the constitutional rights of urban poor dwellers (Article XIII, Section 10 of the 1987 Constitution).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7279, Sections 27, 28:** Key provisions regarding eviction/demolition, especially concerning professional squatters and danger areas.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 455(b)(3)(vi):** Authorizes mayors to order demolition of illegally constructed structures.
*   **Quezon City Ordinance No. SP-1800:** Local ordinance regulating building construction and demolition.
*   **National Building Code (Presidential Decree No. 1096):** Establishes that Building Official has the authority to order demolition of structures under the NBCP. *Gancayco v. City Government of Quezon City*.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Alangdeo v. City Mayor of Baguio* (2015): Emphasizes the limitations on summary eviction and need for compliance with legal processes.
    *   *Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, Aklan* (2014): Clarifies the quasi-judicial function of mayors in demolition cases.
    *   *Fernando v. St. Scholastica's College* (2013):  Discusses police power and its delegation to LGUs.
    *   *Kalipunan ng Damayang Mahihirap, Inc. v. Robredo* (2014): Highlights procedural due process required for lawful eviction and demolition.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Danger Areas" under RA 7279:** The decision clarifies that the structures were not situated in danger areas, as described under the law. The court clarifies that a fire hazard designation does not, on its own, equate to occupation of a "danger area" as defined under RA 7279.
*   **Definition of "Illegally Constructed Structure":** Lack of building permit alone is insufficient for summary demolition, as stated in *Alangdeo v. City of Baguio* (2015).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, reversed the lower courts, and declared the Mayor's demolition order **VOID** due to grave abuse of discretion. The Court found that the Mayor exceeded his statutory authority by failing to adhere to the procedures prescribed by RA 7279, the Local Government Code, the National Building Code, and Quezon City Ordinance No. SP-1800. This case reinforces the principle that while LGUs have powers to demolish and evict, these powers are not absolute and must be exercised within the strict confines of the law and with due regard for the rights of affected individuals.
