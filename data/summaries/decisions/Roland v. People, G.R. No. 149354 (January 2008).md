**Case Summary: Veloso v. People, G.R. No. 149354 (2008)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether Roland Veloso is guilty of estafa under Article 315 (2)(e) of the Revised Penal Code for refusing to pay for food ordered at a restaurant.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Veloso ordered four additional tables at Shangri-La Restaurant beyond a pre-existing arrangement where a third party (Ramon) was covering one table. The additional bill amounted to P11,391.00. Veloso refused to pay, claiming he was Ramon's guest.
*   **Charge:** Veloso was charged with estafa under Art. 315(2)(e) of the Revised Penal Code, which criminalizes obtaining food/refreshments at a restaurant without paying with the intent to defraud.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** The MeTC found Veloso guilty; the RTC affirmed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision, relying heavily on the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding no reversible error. The Court held that Veloso employed fraud by ordering the additional tables, consuming the food, and then refusing to pay, demonstrating intent to defraud.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Veloso is criminally liable for estafa under Article 315 (2)(e) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liability:** Veloso is liable to pay Developers Group of Companies, Inc., the owner of Shangri-La Restaurant, P11,391.00 (the unpaid bill) with legal interest from August 23, 1995, plus P10,000.00 for attorney's fees and litigation expenses.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Intent:** The key element of estafa is the *intent to defraud*, existing *prior to or simultaneously with* the act of obtaining the food. The prosecution has to prove Veloso did not intend to pay at the time of ordering the food. This is often proven circumstantially.
*   **Reliance on Credibility:** The case hinges heavily on the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses (specifically Eva Sto. Domingo). Any successful challenge would require undermining her testimony or demonstrating bias/inconsistency.
*   **Applicability of Estafa:** The defense argued that the situation was merely a civil debt. The SC had to be convinced that Veloso had no intention of paying for the ordered items

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315 (2)(e), Revised Penal Code:** Defines estafa by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts, specifically obtaining food/refreshments without paying with intent to defraud. The penalty for defrauding someone of 6,000 to 12,000 pesos is *prision correccional* in its minimum and medium periods.
*   **People v. Buban, G.R. No. 170471 (2007):** Reinforces the principle that an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review, allowing the appellate court to correct errors even if not specifically assigned.
*   **Credibility assessment by trial courts:**  The Supreme Court defers to the lower courts on matters of witness credibility.

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   The defense argued that Veloso should only be civilly liable for the debt, not criminally liable for estafa.
*   The defense emphasized that Veloso was not prevented from leaving the restaurant, which implied there was no coercion or evidence of criminal intent.
