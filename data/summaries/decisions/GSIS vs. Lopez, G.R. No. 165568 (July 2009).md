Okay, here's a summary of the case, tailored for a lawyer's perspective:

**Case:** *Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) vs. Abraham Lopez*, G.R. No. 165568, July 13, 2009 (610 Phil. 128)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the alleged repurchase of a foreclosed property. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding no perfected contract of sale between GSIS and Lopez.  The SC reinstated the RTC decision dismissing Lopez's claim for specific performance.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Foreclosure & Rental Agreement:** Lopez's property was foreclosed by GSIS in 1984 due to loan default. Lopez was allowed to remain on the property as a tenant, paying monthly rent.

*   **1988 Repurchase Offer:** Lopez offered to repurchase the property. GSIS responded with a letter (August 2, 1988) stating repurchase was subject to Board of Trustees approval, with a 10% deposit required. The letter indicated a purchase price of P155,000 plus back rentals.

*   **Deposit:** Lopez paid P15,500, evidenced by a receipt indicating "payment of 10% cash deposit." No contract of sale was executed.

*   **Ejectment & Compromise Agreement:** GSIS filed an ejectment suit. A compromise agreement was reached in 1991, wherein Lopez acknowledged GSIS's ownership and his status as a lessee, agreeing to pay arrears.

*   **Later Repurchase Attempt:** Lopez made a later attempt to repurchase in 1992, but GSIS demanded a significantly higher price (P844,000).

*   **Specific Performance Suit:** Lopez sued for specific performance, seeking to enforce the alleged 1988 agreement at the P155,000 price.

**Legal Analysis & Holdings:**

*   **No Perfected Contract of Sale:** The Supreme Court held that no perfected contract of sale existed because GSIS's 1988 letter was conditional upon Board of Trustees approval, which was never obtained.  *Coronel v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 103577, 7 October 1996, 263 SCRA 15, 26 was cited regarding the essential elements of a contract of sale, those being (1) consent or the meeting of the minds of the parties; (2) object or subject matter of the contract ; and (3) price or consideration of the sale. The SC emphasized that the consent of GSIS could only be given by its Board per existing regulations, referencing *Manila Metal Container Corporation v. Philippine National Bank*, G.R. No. 166862, 20 December 2006, 511 SCRA 444, 467-468. Absence of consent means the parties never progressed beyond the negotiation stage.

*   **Rejection of Tacit Approval Argument:** The Court rejected the Court of Appeals' finding of tacit approval based on the failure to refund the deposit. The subsequent Compromise Agreement, where Lopez acknowledged GSIS's ownership and his lessee status, was deemed contradictory to any claim of a perfected sale, further emphasizing the principle that contracts are defined by their elements and not assumptions.

*   **Rejection of Promissory Estoppel:** The Court did not find promissory estoppel applicable. The Court essentially found that any reliance by Lopez on the initial offer was unreasonable given the subsequent actions and agreements of the parties.

*   **Earnest Money Inapplicable:** Because no contract of sale existed, the concept of earnest money under Article 1482 of the Civil Code was deemed inapplicable.

*   **Compensation:** GSIS was allowed to retain the P15,500 deposit, applying it to Lopez's rental arrears under the principles of legal compensation (Articles 1278, 1279, and 1281 of the Civil Code). *Serrano v. Caguiat*, G.R. No. 139173, 28 February 2007, 517 SCRA 57, 66, citing Chua v. Court of Appeals, 449 Phil. 25 (2003).

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **GSIS:** Not obligated to sell the property at the original offered price. GSIS was obligated to compensate Lopez for the 15,500 deposit until it was found that legal compensation applied, offsetting the rental arrears.
*   **Lopez:** Liable for unpaid rentals.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Initial Letter:** The August 2, 1988 letter arguably created an ambiguity regarding GSIS's intent, despite the explicit condition of Board approval. This ambiguity, while not sufficient to form a contract, could have been interpreted as a strong invitation to treat or an offer with a condition subsequent.

*   **Reliance & Detriment:** While the Supreme Court did not find promissory estoppel, the fact that Lopez paid the deposit and seemingly waited for Board approval for several years highlights the potential for equitable arguments based on detrimental reliance.

*   Civil Code, Article 1279 (Requisites for Compensation)
*   Civil Code, Article 1281 (Total or Partial Compensation)

*   *Serrano v. Caguiat*, G.R. No. 139173, 28 February 2007, 517 SCRA 57, 66

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly applied contract law principles, finding no perfected contract of sale due to the lack of consent from GSIS's Board of Trustees. The Compromise Agreement served as a key piece of evidence negating Lopez's claim, highlighting the importance of subsequent acts in interpreting the parties' intentions.
