## Legal Document Summary: Dueñas v. Guce-Africa, G.R. No. 165679 (2009)

This case involves a breach of contract dispute arising from a Construction Contract between Engr. Apolinario Dueñas (Petitioner, Contractor) and Alice Guce-Africa (Respondent, Owner) for the demolition and construction of a four-bedroom house.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Construction Contract:** Signed in January 1998 for P500,000.00, requiring Petitioner to furnish all materials and labor.
*   **Completion Date:** Interior portions of the house were to be completed by March 31, 1998.
*   **Payment:** Respondent paid P550,000.00, P50,000.00 more than the contract price.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Contractor):** Complete the construction project by the stipulated deadline, provide quality workmanship, and obtain necessary permits (disputed; Petitioner claimed Respondent was responsible).
*   **Respondent (Owner):** Pay the agreed contract price.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Found liable for breach of contract due to failure to complete the project on time and substandard workmanship. Initially, the RTC awarded actual damages for repairs and completion. The CA affirmed this but deleted attorney's fees. The Supreme Court ultimately modified the CA decision.
*   **Respondent:** Initially sought the return of the overpayment, cost of repairs, and cost to complete the project, as well as damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Responsibility for Permits:** The contract's silence on which party was responsible for obtaining construction permits led to conflicting claims. Petitioner initially claimed the respondent's responsibility, but changed this during the trial.
*   **Additional Work:** Petitioner claimed the P50,000.00 overpayment was for additional work, while Respondent alleged it was simply an overpayment.
*   **Delay:** Petitioner attributed the delay to weather, holidays, and Respondent's order to stop work. The lower courts found these insufficient excuses. The SC did not reverse this finding, as factual findings of the lower courts are generally binding.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari, limiting review to questions of law, not fact. **Fong v. Velayo, G.R. No. 155488, December 6, 2006, 510 SCRA 320** defines the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact.
*   **Article 2199, Civil Code:**  Requires proof of pecuniary loss for actual damages.
*   **Ong v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117103, January 21, 1999, 301 SCRA 387:** Defines actual damages.
*   **Articles 2216, 2224, and 2225, Civil Code:**  Governing temperate damages in lieu of actual damages if exact amount cannot be determined.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Construction Contract itself is not reproduced in the document.
*   The specific terms of the additional work remain unclear.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition. While it upheld the lower courts' finding of breach of contract, it *deleted* the award of actual damages due to lack of documentary proof. In lieu of actual damages, the Court awarded **temperate damages** of P100,000.00, citing the breach and associated inconveniences experienced by the Respondent. The Court ordered the Petitioner to pay the Respondent the temperate damages.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

The case highlights the importance of clear and specific contract language, particularly regarding permits and change orders. The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the need for *documentary* evidence to support claims for actual damages. Without such proof, even if a breach is established, only temperate damages may be awarded. The decision reinforces the general rule that factual findings of the lower courts are binding on the Supreme Court unless exceptional circumstances exist.
