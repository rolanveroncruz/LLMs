## Summary of A.M. No. MTJ-09-1729

**Case:** *Noryn S. Tan vs. Judge Maria Clarita Casuga-Tabin*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a Municipal Trial Court in Cities Judge (MTCC) for denial of due process in a BP 22 case (Criminal Case No. 118628).

**Key Issue:** Whether Judge Casuga-Tabin abused her authority by issuing a warrant of arrest against Noryn Tan without proper notice of arraignment.

**Facts:**

*   Tan filed a complaint alleging she was arrested based on a warrant issued by Judge Casuga-Tabin for failing to appear at arraignment in a BP 22 case. Tan claimed she never received notice of the arraignment.
*   Judge Casuga-Tabin admitted sending the notice via registered mail to the PNP Quezon City for service on Tan, but conceded no return had been made by the police before issuing the warrant.
*   Judge Casuga-Tabin justified the warrant based on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty (Sec. 3, Rule 131, Rules of Court) and Sec. 12 of the 1983 Rules on Summary Procedure in Special Cases, arguing that bail could be required since Tan resided outside Baguio City where the violation was committed. The OCA initially recommended dismissal based on presumptive notice.
*   The Supreme Court reversed the initial dismissal upon reconsideration, finding that the warrant's issuance was improper.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Sec. 16, 1991 Revised Rule on Summary Procedure:**  This rule generally prohibits arrest in summary procedure cases unless the accused fails to appear when required.  The Court held that the Judge's actions violated this rule, as there was no proper notice to the accused to appear in the first place. *Guillen v. Nicolas, 360 Phil. 1, 12 (1998)*
*   **Presumption of Regularity (Sec. 3, Rule 131, Rules of Court):**  While this presumption exists, the Court stated it cannot be the *sole* basis for issuing an arrest warrant, especially when notice wasn't properly served.  Sending notice to the police, rather than to the accused's residence, is insufficient.
*   **1983 Rules on Summary Procedure in Special Cases (Sections 10 & 12):**  Judge Casuga-Tabin relied on these rules to justify the warrant.  The Court found this interpretation flawed.  Sec. 12 merely addresses when bail is required, not when an arrest warrant may be issued *without proper notice*. Furthermore, the 1991 Rules supersede portions of the 1983 Rules.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The core finding is that issuing the warrant without ensuring Tan received notice of the arraignment violated her due process rights.

**Liabilities and Sanctions:**

*   **Judge Casuga-Tabin found guilty of abuse of authority.** While there was no malicious intent, ignorance of basic law cannot excuse her liability. *Aguilar v. Dalanao, 388 Phil. 717, 724 (2000)*
*   **Fine of P10,000.00 imposed.** Mitigating factors were considered (first offense, length of service). *Daiz v. Adason, 353 Phil. 1, 7 (1998)*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:**  This case highlights the risk of relying solely on the presumption of regularity, especially when dealing with fundamental rights like liberty. Courts must ensure actual notice.
*   **Interpretation of Summary Procedure Rules:** This case provides guidance on the interplay between the 1983 and 1991 Rules on Summary Procedure.
