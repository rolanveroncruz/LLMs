**Legal Document Summary: Aquino v. People, G.R. No. 165448, July 27, 2009 (611 Phil. 442)**

**Case:** Petition for Review assailing the CA's decision finding Ernesto Aquino (petitioner) guilty of violating Section 68 of Presidential Decree No. 705 (PD 705), the Revised Forestry Code.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 68 of PD 705.  Accusation: Illegal cutting of pine trees (9 trees, 16.55 cubic meters) at Teachers' Camp, Baguio City, exceeding the number authorized by a DENR permit issued to Teachers' Camp for cutting 14 trees.
*   **Permit Details:** DENR issued a permit to Teachers' Camp to cut 14 dead Benguet pine trees for repairs.  The permit stipulated conditions, including timber utilization, replacement planting (140 seedlings), and penalties for violations under Section 68 of PD 705.
*   **Petitioner's Role:**  A forest ranger from CENRO, tasked with supervising the cutting of trees at Teachers' Camp.  He supervised sawyers (Santiago and Masing), who cut more trees than authorized.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Aquino, Cuteng, and Santiago found guilty. Nacatab and Masing acquitted.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Modified, acquitting Cuteng and Santiago but affirming Aquino's conviction, sentencing him to 6 years and 1 day of prision mayor to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of reclusion temporal. The CA reasoned that as a forest ranger with custody of the permit, Aquino was responsible for ensuring compliance with its terms.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision and acquitted Aquino.

**Legal Reasoning and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 68, PD 705:**  This section penalizes (1) cutting, gathering, collecting, or removing timber without authority; and (2) possessing timber without legal documents.
*   **Supreme Court's Analysis:** The Court held that Aquino did not "cut, gather, collect or remove" the trees within the meaning of Section 68. The lumber was used by Teachers' Camp. Furthermore, his co-accused were acquitted.
* **Administrative Liability:** Court suggested Aquino was negligent in his supervisory duties.
*   **Conspiracy:**  The Court found no conspiracy as Aquino's co-accused were acquitted.
*   **Lack of Direct Action:** It was the sawyers, not Aquino, who physically cut the trees.  Aquino's presence and failure to prevent the overcutting, while potentially negligent, did not constitute a violation of Section 68.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** This case does not preclude administrative actions against Aquino for negligence in his duties as a forest ranger.
*   **Misinterpretation of Supervisory Roles:** Forest rangers and supervisors may have ambiguity as to what is considered illegal timbering.
*   **Over reliance on Subordinates:** Risk in blindly relying on subordinates (e.g., sawyers) who cut the lumber.
*   **Vagueness of Terms:** Potential for similar situations to arise where interpretation of "cutting, gathering, collecting or removing timber" is contested.

**Case Law References:**

*   Cited *Republic v. Heirs of Fabio, G.R. No. 159589, 23 December 2008* for the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact.
*   Cited *Revaldo v. People, G.R. No. 170589, 16 April 2009* for the elements of the two separate offenses found under Section 68 of PD 705.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "without any authority" in relation to the existence of a permit where its terms are violated.
