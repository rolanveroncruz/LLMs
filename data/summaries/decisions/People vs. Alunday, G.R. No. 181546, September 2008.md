## Legal Document Summary: People v. Alunday (G.R. No. 181546)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Ricardo Alunday

**Issue:** Appeal from the Court of Appeals affirming the RTC's conviction of Ricardo Alunday for violation of Section 9 of Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) - cultivation of marijuana.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 9, RA 6425:** Penalizes the planting, cultivating, or culturing of Indian hemp or other plants classified as dangerous drugs with *reclusion perpetua* to death and a fine.  The land is subject to confiscation unless the owner proves lack of knowledge and due diligence. Higher penalties if the land is part of the public domain.
*   **Section 5(a), Rule 113, Rules of Court:** Lawful warrantless arrest in *flagrante delicto* - when a person is committing, has committed, or is attempting to commit an offense in the presence of the arresting officer.

**Facts:**

*   Police received information about a marijuana plantation on Mount Churyon.
*   After validation, a police team raided the plantation on August 3, 2000.
*   Alunday was caught cutting and gathering marijuana plants during the raid.  An M16 rifle was also found in a hut near the plants.
*   Alunday denied the charges, claiming he was there to gather lumber and didn't know what marijuana looked like.
*   RTC convicted Alunday for violating Section 9 of RA 6425 but acquitted him for illegal possession of firearms.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

1.  Guilt not proven beyond reasonable doubt.
2.  Evidence inadmissible due to unlawful arrest.

**Court's Holding:**

Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding Alunday's conviction.

**Key Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The court gave credence to the police officers' testimonies, as they are presumed to have performed their duties regularly, absent evidence of ill motive (*People v. Bongalon, 425 Phil. 96, 114 (2002)*).  The court also gave weight to the factual findings of the trial court, especially regarding the credibility of witnesses.
*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Alunday's arrest was lawful because he was caught *in flagrante delicto* (*People v. Sucro, G.R. No. 93239*).  The Court rejected the argument that the police had ample time to secure a warrant, emphasizing the need for validation of the initial tip.
*   **Waiver of Illegal Arrest Argument:** Alunday waived his right to object to the legality of the arrest by entering a plea of not guilty during arraignment and actively participating in the trial without raising the objection (*People v. Tidula, 354 Phil. 609, 624 (1998)*). The court has jurisdiction over the person when the accused voluntarily submits thereto, as evidenced by their plea and participation in the trial.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Alunday:** Liable for *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of PHP 500,000 for cultivating marijuana under Section 9 of RA 6425.
*   **Potential Liability:** The landowner could potentially be liable for confiscation and escheatment of the land to the State if they knew about the cultivation and did not exercise due diligence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ownership of Land:** Although not explicitly stated, the judgment implies that the land where the marijuana was planted was not conclusively proven to be part of the public domain, avoiding the imposition of the maximum penalty under Section 9 of RA 6425.
*   **Ambiguity of Knowledge:** The decision touches on the potential liability of the landowner if they are aware of the illegal cultivation.  Further litigation could arise if a separate action is brought against the landowner, especially if the evidence concerning their knowledge is ambiguous.
*   **Chain of Custody:** While the judgment mentions the testing of the marijuana plants by the PNP Crime Laboratory, it does not explicitly detail the chain of custody. Although no error was apparent enough for the court to deem the integrity of the evidence compromised, this could be challenged in future cases.
