**Case Summary: *Sales v. Barro*, G.R. No. 171678 (2008)**

**Nature:** Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC decision that affirmed the MeTC decision in an ejectment case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed the ejectment complaint for lack of jurisdiction, specifically regarding the pleading requirements for either forcible entry or unlawful detainer.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the complaint.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' (Sales et al.) Argument:** Claimed unlawful detainer, arguing respondent's (Barro) possession was tolerated since he acted as caretaker. They rely on TCT No. 262237 showing ownership from Jan 6, 2004 and demand for rents from Jan 2004 as evidence of this tolerance.
*   **Respondent's (Barro) Argument:** Denied receiving demand letter or barangay summons, suggesting lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Court of Appeals' Rationale:** Complaint failed to allege prior physical possession, a jurisdictional requirement for *forcible entry*.
*   **Supreme Court's Rationale:**
    *   The complaint's allegations and reliefs sought indicate a *forcible entry* claim, not unlawful detainer.
    *   The allegation that the respondent constructed a shanty *without consent* and the demand for rent *from the beginning* of the occupation contradicts the element of initial tolerated possession required for unlawful detainer (citing *Heirs of Demetrio Melchor v. Melchor*, G.R. No. 150633).
    *   As reiterated in *Cañiza v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 110427, jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint and the nature of the relief sought.
    *   The complaint was fatally defective as a forcible entry case because it lacked an allegation of the petitioners' *prior physical possession* (citing *Tirona v. Alejo*, G.R. No. 129313). *Tirona* emphasizes that the "possession" required for forcible entry is *physical possession*. Alleging registered ownership is insufficient.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The respondent had no legal obligation to vacate based on this complaint.
*   Petitioners are liable for costs.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights the crucial distinction between *forcible entry* and *unlawful detainer* and the strict pleading requirements for each, particularly the need to explicitly allege prior physical possession in a forcible entry action.
*   The fact that petitioners claimed ownership from January 6, 2004, yet demanded rent from January 2004, was construed against them.
*   The Supreme Court rejected the estoppel argument, reiterating that lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any stage, even *motu proprio* by the court (citing *Andaya v. Abadia*, G.R. No. 104033 and *Venancio Figueroa y Cervantes v. People*, G.R. No. 147406).

*   Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court (Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer)
