**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bugtong***

**Case Citation:** *People of the Philippines v. Allan Bugtong y Amoroso*, G.R. No. 220451, February 26, 2018.

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeals and acquitting the accused-appellant of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal sale of *shabu*).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The core issue revolves around the broken chain of custody of the seized *shabu*. The Supreme Court found multiple critical gaps:
    *   **Marking:** Conflicting testimony regarding who placed the initial "AB" marking on the sachet (SPO1 Puasan vs. P/Supt. Baldevieso). The Court deemed it more plausible that the forensic chemist (Baldevieso) placed the marking, negating the claim that the marking occurred immediately upon seizure.
    *   **Testimony:** Failure to present PO1 Cachila, who received the seized item from SPO1 Puasan at the Crime Laboratory, to testify regarding its receipt and turnover to P/Supt. Baldevieso.
    *   **Inventory:** Lack of evidence demonstrating compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding physical inventory and photographing the seized item in the presence of required witnesses (accused, elected public official, representative from the National Prosecution Service or the media) as amended by RA 10640.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) Violation:** The Court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, particularly the immediate marking of the seized item. It highlights that while non-compliance is not automatically fatal if justified, the prosecution failed to provide any justification in this case, weakening its case.

**Legal Reasoning & Case Law:**

*   The court reiterates the elements for illegal sale of dangerous drugs: (1) identity of buyer and seller; (2) object and consideration; and (3) delivery and payment.
*   **Key Holding:** The integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were compromised due to the broken chain of custody, leading to reasonable doubt.
*   The court cites *People v. Hementiza* emphasizing the need for testimony regarding every link of the chain of custody of seized drugs.
*   The ruling acknowledges the susceptibility of buy-bust operations to abuse (*People v. Barte*). Procedural safeguards are to protect individuals from abuse and preserve evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith Exception:** While the amendment to Section 21 allows for flexibility, reliance on the "good faith" exception requires a strong showing of preserving the integrity and evidentiary value, which was not demonstrated here.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:**  The Supreme Court effectively rejects the presumption that police officers regularly perform their duties in light of the demonstrated procedural lapses.
*   **The ruling highlights the necessity of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases.**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted the accused based on the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drug.  The lack of immediate marking, failure to present a crucial witness (PO1 Cachila), and non-compliance with the inventory and photography requirements of Section 21, RA 9165, undermined the integrity of the evidence, creating reasonable doubt.
