Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc. vs. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 254433 (April 17, 2024)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, appealing the Court of Appeals' (CA) reversal of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision, which had granted Arlo Aluminum Co., Inc.'s (Arlo) application for land registration.

**Summary:**

Arlo sought registration of title to Lot Nos. 7947 and 7948 in Pasig City, claiming continuous, open, adverse possession by itself and its predecessors-in-interest (Tambongco, Atienza, and Crisostomo) since June 12, 1945, under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (PD 1529). The RTC granted the application, but the CA reversed, finding Arlo failed to prove the land was alienable/disposable and failed to adequately prove possession dating back to June 12, 1945. The Supreme Court (SC) held that Arlo had not met the legal burden, the SC applied *Republic Act No. 11573* and *Republic v. Pasig Rizal Co., Inc.* retroactively, and then remanded the case to the CA for reception of new evidence.

**Key Provisions and Legal Issues:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 14:** Governs who may apply for land registration. The SC notes the amendments made by Republic Act No. 11573.
*   **Republic Act No. 11573:** Amended PD 1529, changing the required period of possession to "at least 20 years immediately preceding the filing of the application" and specifying required proof of alienability. Applied retroactively to pending cases.
*   **Alienable and Disposable Land:** A key requirement for land registration. The CA found the DENR certifications submitted by Arlo to be insufficient. Republic Act No. 11573 has changed what is sufficient.
*   **Possession and Occupation:** Arlo must prove "open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation" under a bona fide claim of ownership for at least 20 years according to the amended PD 1529. The SC found the testimonies and documents submitted by Arlo to be insufficient, echoing the findings of the CA.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Arlo, as the applicant, bears the burden of proving compliance with all requirements for land registration.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Arlo's Obligation:** To present additional evidence on remand, specifically:
    *   A certification from a DENR-designated geodetic engineer attesting to the alienable/disposable status of the land, referencing relevant administrative orders, proclamations, or LC Map numbers (per Section 7 of RA 11573).
    *   Evidence establishing at least 20 years of open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession under a bona fide claim of ownership immediately preceding the filing of the application (as amended by RA 11573).
    *   Reconcile discrepancies in areas reported in DENR certifications versus those listed in the application for registration.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Present Sufficient Evidence:** Arlo may still fail to meet the burden of proof, even with the opportunity to present new evidence on remand.
*   **Challenge to Alienability:** The Republic may present evidence to rebut any claim of alienability and disposability.
*   **Adverse Possession Claims:** Other parties may assert competing claims of adverse possession.

**Case Law:**

*   *Spouses Tan v. Republic of the Philippines*, 593 Phil. 493 (2008): Cited by Arlo regarding the sufficiency of DENR certifications, but this is superseded by Republic Act No. 11573 and subsequent jurisprudence.
*   *Republic v. Pasig Rizal Co., Inc.*, G.R. No. 213207 (February 15, 2022): Provides guidelines on the retroactive application of Republic Act No. 11573.
*   *Republic v. Buenaventura*, G.R. No. 198629 (April 5, 2022); *Superiora Locale Dell' Istituto Delle Suore Di San Giuseppe Del Caburlotto v. Republic*, G.R. No. 242781, June 21, 2022; *Republic v. Spouses Tan*, G.R. No. 232778 (August 23, 2023): All apply the guidelines from *Pasig Rizal*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Evidence of Possession:** The adequacy of the evidence presented by Arlo is the central contentious issue.
*   **Specific Area Discrepancies:** SC specifically flags that the area under lot numbers 7948 and 7947 is different in the DENR-NCR certification than that of the application.

**Conclusion:**

The case is remanded for further proceedings under Republic Act No. 11573. Arlo must secure a proper DENR certification and present sufficient evidence of 20 years of possession prior to 2012 to successfully register the land.
