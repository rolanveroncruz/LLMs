**Legal Document Summary: Biglang-Awa vs. Philippine Trust Company (G.R. NO. 158998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision reversing an RTC Order regarding the cancellation of a Notice of Lis Pendens.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Ligaya, Charito, Paraluman, and Efren Biglang-Awa (Children)
*   **Respondent:** Philippine Trust Company (Mortgagee)
*   **Other Key Parties:** Roberth B. Tolentino (Alleged Fraudster), Encarnacion Cleofas Vda. de Biglang-Awa (Mother, initially a plaintiff, then disavowed the suit)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership of eight parcels of land in Quezon City. Four parcels were initially owned by Encarnacion; the rest by her children, the petitioners.
*   **Fraud Allegations:** Petitioners allege Tolentino fraudulently secured mortgages on Encarnacion's land with Philippine Trust and later fraudulently obtained titles to all eight parcels.
*   **Encarnacion's Dismissal:** Encarnacion withdrew from the suit, claiming she voluntarily sold her land to Tolentino. This dismissal was "with prejudice" as to Encarnacion and all defendants (Tolentino, PTC and the Register of Deeds).
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens:** Petitioners filed a notice of lis pendens on Tolentino's titles. The crux of the case revolves around the cancellation of the notice of lis pendens on the TCTs derived from Encarnacion's original titles (TCT Nos. N-198629, N-198630, N-198631, and N-198632).
*   **Motion to Amend Complaint:** Petitioners attempted to amend their complaint to include Encarnacion and another sibling as defendants, alleging co-ownership and a fraudulent partition. The RTC denied this motion, and that denial ultimately became final and executory.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA reversed the RTC's denial of the motion to cancel the lis pendens, ordering its cancellation on the titles derived from Encarnacion's ownership.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Philippine Trust Company:** As mortgagee, PTC's primary concern is the security of its mortgage. A valid title in Tolentino's name enhances the mortgage security; a cancelled lis pendens allows for easier foreclosure or sale.
*   **Roberth B. Tolentino:** Subject to allegations of fraud. Potentially liable for damages and reconveyance if the fraud is proven in a separate action.
*   **Petitioners:** Bear the burden of proving their claims of co-ownership and fraud. Their initial lawsuit failed, and their amended complaint was not admitted.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Finality of Dismissal:** The "with prejudice" dismissal of Encarnacion's claim raises a *res judicata* issue, potentially barring any future claims regarding those specific four parcels of land, either by Encarnacion or those claiming through her.
*   **Amendment of Complaint:** The RTC's denial of the Motion to Amend the Complaint is critical. While the Supreme Court notes the RTC's reasoning was erroneous, the denial was ultimately upheld, preventing Petitioners from adding Encarnacion and alleging new theories of fraudulent partition and co-ownership. The finality of the RTC Resolution denying the amendment effectively bars the introduction of these new claims in the present case.
*   **Co-ownership Argument:** The Supreme Court reiterates the denial of the Motion to Amend makes it impossible to pursue claims of co-ownership through an amended pleading as these claims had not been pleaded.
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens Cancellation:** Sec. 14, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides the grounds for cancellation. The CA, affirmed by the Supreme Court, found that the petitioners lacked an interest in the properties covered by Encarnacion's titles, making the lis pendens unnecessary to protect their rights. This hinges on the admission in the original complaint that those specific parcels were previously owned exclusively by Encarnacion, which they are precluded from contesting due to prior court orders.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 10, Sections 2 & 3 of the Rules of Court:** Governs amendment of pleadings. *Republic v. Africa* (G.R. No. 172315) addresses amendment as a matter of right. *Philippine Ports Authority v. William Gothong Aboitiz (WGA), Inc.* (G.R. No. 158401) addresses amendments by leave of Court and alteration of cause of action.
*   **Rule 13, Section 14 of the Rules of Court:** Governs cancellation of notice of lis pendens.
*   ***Romero v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 142406):** Discusses the purpose and effects of a notice of lis pendens.
*   **Res Judicata:** Though not explicitly discussed, the doctrine is implicated by the dismissal "with prejudice" regarding Encarnacion's claims. *Collantes v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 169604, March 6, 2007* regarding immutability of final judgments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of the "without prejudice" dismissal in the RTC's April 16, 2001 Resolution was contentious, with PTC arguing it only applied to the remaining parcels not previously owned by Encarnacion. The Supreme Court did not directly address the impact of the amendment on the original properties owned by Encarnacion.
*   Whether the filing of the amended complaint prior to Tolentino filing his own answer constituted a matter of right to amend under Rule 10, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision to cancel the notice of lis pendens. The petitioners are in a difficult position due to Encarnacion's disavowal of the original suit, the denial of their motion to amend the complaint, and the finality of the related orders. The dismissal, with prejudice, of the complaint as it relates to Encarnacion's former properties, combined with the admission in the original complaint concerning Encarnacion's ownership, significantly undermines the petitioners' current claims regarding those specific parcels. While they may still have recourse against Tolentino on other grounds (regarding the remaining properties), the cancellation of the lis pendens on the properties derived from Encarnacion makes any potential recovery on those specific properties significantly more difficult.
