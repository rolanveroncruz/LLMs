## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Tablang (G.R. No. 174859)

**Case Overview:** This is a review of the CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Jofer Tablang for rape of AAA, a woman with mild mental retardation, committed in 1997. The accused was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. The Supreme Court affirms the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, as defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended before RA 8353), specifically carnal knowledge of a woman who is demented/mentally retarded, achieved with the use of a bladed weapon.
*   **Elements Proven:**
    *   Carnal knowledge: Testimony of AAA indicates penetration, supported by medical examination (healed lacerations). The court cited precedent (e.g., *People v. Ortoa*) holding that penetration of the labia is sufficient, and fresh lacerations are not essential.
    *   Mental Retardation: Established through expert testimony (Dr. Labay, Dr. Belen) indicating AAA had mild mental retardation with a mental age of 9-12 years. Court cites that carnal knowledge of a woman of weak intellect to the extent that she is incapable of giving consent is rape.
    *   Use of a bladed weapon: Alleged in the information and confirmed through testimony of AAA and Francisco. Qualifies the rape and makes the imposable penalty *reclusion perpetua to death*.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua*. The SC upheld the lower courts' imposition of the lesser penalty due to the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, citing Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Damages:** P50,000 civil indemnity and P50,000 moral damages awarded to the victim.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused, Jofer Tablang, is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused, Jofer Tablang, is obligated to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to AAA.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Appellant argued the lower court erred in giving credence to AAA's testimony, given her mental condition. The SC, however, relied on the trial court's assessment of the witness's credibility and consistency, despite her condition. Reference is made to People v. Maceda, People v. Salomon, People v. Gerones, and People v. Antonio to support the notion that a mentally retarded person can be a competent witness.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The appellant argued that healed lacerations, rather than fresh ones, undermined the rape claim. The court dismissed this argument, emphasizing that hymen rupture is not essential and that the slightest penetration is sufficient for rape.
*   **Lack of Resistance:** The decision notes physical resistance is not needed when the victim is subdued with intimidation or fear.
*   **Discrepancies in Testimony** Court acknowledged that the victim may have inconsistencies due to mental retardation but that the inconsistencies are on minor or trivial matters and gave more credibility that the story was not rehearsed.

**Ambiguities:**

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

High risk for the appellant. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. There are unlikely grounds for further appeal, given the factual findings and legal precedent cited.
