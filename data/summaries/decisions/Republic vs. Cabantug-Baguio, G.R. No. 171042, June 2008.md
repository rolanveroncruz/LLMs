## Legal Document Summary: *Republic vs. Cabantug-Baguio*, G.R. No. 171042

**Case Overview:**

This is a Petition for Review filed by the Republic challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) declaration of nullity of marriage between Lynnette Cabantug-Baguio (Lynnette) and Martini Dico Baguio (Martini) based on the grounds of Martini's psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. The Supreme Court ultimately **reversed** the CA decision, dismissing the case.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** The core legal basis for the petition. Defines psychological incapacity as a ground for nullity of marriage. The SC emphasizes the need for gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability, per existing jurisprudence.
*   **Psychological Incapacity Defined:** The Court emphasizes that psychological incapacity must be a serious psychological illness existing *prior* to the marriage, rendering a party incapable of understanding and fulfilling marital obligations. It must be grave, permanent, and incurable, not mere incompatibility, difficulty, refusal, or neglect. *Republic v. Court of Appeals* (335 Phil. 664 (1997)) is cited.
*   **Evidence Presented:** Lynnette relied on her deposition, the Seafarer Information Sheet of Martini and the testimony and Psychological Evaluation Report of Dr. Andres Gerong (Clinical Psychologist). The Solicitor General argued that this evidence was insufficient to prove psychological incapacity.
*   **Expert Testimony (Dr. Gerong):** The Solicitor General successfully argued that Dr. Gerong's report and testimony failed to adequately establish the elements of psychological incapacity, as required by *Republic vs. Court of Appeals and Molina, 268 SCRA 198 (1998)*. Specifically, he asserted that:
    *   Dr. Gerong did not provide sufficient details of Martini's past life to explain his alleged incapacity.
    *   He failed to explain why Martini's alleged incapacity was clinically or medically permanent, relying solely on the assertion that Martini was a "mama's boy" since adolescence.
    *   He failed to sufficiently explain the gravity of the alleged incapacity and the specific disorder Martini was suffering from.
    *   His report lacked details showing a pattern of behavior demonstrating psychological incapacity and failed to explain its gravity or incurability.
*   **"Mama's Boy" Argument:** The CA characterized Martini being a "mama's boy" as a manifestation of a psychological disorder. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that this trait alone, absent substantial supporting evidence, is insufficient to establish psychological incapacity.
*   **Abandonment:** The SC clarifies that abandonment is a ground for legal separation (Article 55) and not for nullity of marriage under Article 36. The CA incorrectly conflated Martini's abandonment with psychological incapacity.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof lies on the plaintiff (Lynnette) to demonstrate the nullity of the marriage based on psychological incapacity. The SC found that she failed to discharge this burden.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Insufficient Evidence:** The primary risk was the insufficiency of evidence to meet the stringent requirements for proving psychological incapacity under Article 36 and prevailing jurisprudence. The court highlighted the need for more detailed evidence of the defendant's past and a thorough explanation of the nature, gravity, and incurability of the alleged condition.
*   **Dated Information Sheet:** While the court relaxed the requirements for personal examination of the person declared psychologically incapacitated, the Solicitor General was able to successfully argue that Lynnette's information sheet could not be relied on as it was undated.
*   **Misapplication of *Marcos v. Marcos*** (397 Phil. 840 (2000))**: The CA's reliance on *Marcos v. Marcos* was deemed misplaced. While *Marcos v. Marcos* allows for the absence of physical examination, it still requires the totality of evidence to prove gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.

*   *Marcos v. Marcos, 397 Phil. 840 (2000)*: Addressed the necessity of a medical examination.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court underscored the importance of upholding the sanctity of marriage and cautioned against the indiscriminate application of Article 36. It emphasized the need for compelling evidence, meeting the rigorous standards established in *Molina*, to justify a declaration of nullity based on psychological incapacity. The decision serves as a reminder that personality quirks or marital difficulties do not automatically equate to psychological incapacity, and that expert testimony must be thorough and well-supported to overcome the presumption in favor of marriage.
