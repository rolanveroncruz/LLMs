## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Peña

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Maximo Dela Peña, G.R. No. 219581, January 31, 2018

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for piracy under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 532

**Key Provisions:**

*   **PD 532, Sec. 2(d):** Defines piracy as an attack or seizure of any vessel or its cargo, equipment, or belongings of passengers/crew by violence, intimidation, or force in Philippine waters.
*   **PD 532, Sec. 2(a):** Defines "Philippine waters" to include rivers and all waters belonging to the Philippines.
*   **PD 532, Sec. 3:** Prescribes the penalties for piracy, escalating from *reclusion temporal* to *reclusion perpetua* depending on the presence of physical injuries or other crimes, and potentially death (now *reclusion perpetua* due to RA 9346).

**Factual Summary:**

Maximo Dela Peña was convicted of piracy for attacking a pump boat on a river in Samar. The assailants, including Dela Peña, seized copra cargo, the boat's engine, and personal belongings of the passengers. Dela Peña argued that the Information was insufficient and that he was not properly identified.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld Dela Peña's conviction for piracy.

*   The Information was deemed sufficient, as it identified the location as a river within the Philippines, which falls under the definition of "Philippine waters" in PD 532, Sec. 2(a).
*   The Information sufficiently alleged the elements of the crime of piracy, specifically referencing the items seized including 13 sacks of copra, the boat's engine, and personal belongings of the passengers were taken by the appellant and his armed companions.
*   Positive identification of Dela Peña by a victim (Julita) who knew him for 16 years outweighed his alibi.

**Obligations:**

*   **Dela Peña:** To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay temperate damages of P30,000 (in lieu of actual damages due to lack of receipts) plus 6% annual interest from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dela Peña:** Criminal liability for piracy under PD 532. He is subject to a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*. Also, he must pay temperate damages to the victim, Julita Nacoboan, in the amount of P30,000 plus interest.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The key ambiguity revolved around whether the Information sufficiently alleged the elements of piracy, specifically the location being within "Philippine waters" and whether a river qualified as "Philippine waters". This was resolved by the court favorably to the prosecution using the definition of "Philippine waters" in PD 532, Sec. 2(a).
*   Lack of substantiating receipts for actual damages limited the award to temperate damages instead, creating financial risk for the claimant (Tan v. OMC Carriers. Inc.:[11] 654 Phil. 443, 454 (2011)).

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974)
*   Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty)
*   Civil Code of the Philippines (Articles 2221 and 2224).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Ramos, 715 Phil. 193, 207 (2013)* reinforces the principle that positive identification outweighs alibi.
*   *Tan v. OMC Carriers, Inc., 654 Phil. 443, 454 (2011)* outlines the requirements for proving actual damages with certainty.

**Note:** The analysis emphasizes that the penalty for piracy, while potentially death under PD 532, is effectively *reclusion perpetua* due to the prohibition of the death penalty under RA 9346.
