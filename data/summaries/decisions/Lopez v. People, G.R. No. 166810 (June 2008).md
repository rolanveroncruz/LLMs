Here's a concise legal summary of *Lopez v. People*, G.R. No. 166810, June 26, 2008:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision upholding Lopez's conviction for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 4885. Lopez issued a DBP check for P20,000 to Ables, which was dishonored because the account was closed.

**Key Provisions & Elements of Estafa:**

*   **Article 315, paragraph 2(d) (RPC):** Criminalizes issuing a postdated check or a check for an obligation when the drawer has insufficient funds or a closed account.
*   **Elements:**
    *   Issuance of a check for an obligation.
    *   Insufficient funds/closed account at the time of issuance.
    *   Defraudation of the payee.
    *   Damage to the payee.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Lopez's Obligation:**  To ensure sufficient funds or an open account to cover the check when issued.
*   **Liability:**  Criminal liability for Estafa, resulting in a prison sentence and obligation to indemnify Ables for P20,000 plus costs.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315, paragraph 2(d)** (Estafa via issuance of bouncing check).
*   **Republic Act No. 4885** (Amended Article 315).
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 818** (Penalties for Estafa; *Reclusion Temporal* if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Determines minimum and maximum penalties.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 114(d):** Notice of dishonor not required where the drawer has no right to expect the check to be honored (e.g., closed account).
*   Cited case laws: *People v. Juliano*, *People v. Holzer*, *People v. Chua*, *People v. Ojeda*, *Recuerdo v. People*, *Villarta v. CA*, *Guinhawa v. People*, *Pacheco v. Court of Appeals* (distinguished; argued but rejected by the court).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deceit (Fraudulent Intent):** Lopez argued lack of deceit, claiming Ables knew of the insufficient funds. Court rejected this because Lopez failed to disclose the closed account. The court considered verbal notice of dishonor sufficient.
*   **Notice of Dishonor:**  Lopez argued that the prosecution failed to prove that Lopez received the notice of dishonor of the check. The SC held that the receipt of notice of dishonor is not an element of the offense and it is not necessary if verbal notice had been given, and the bank account was already closed.

**Conclusion:**

The court emphasized that it is criminal fraud or deceit that is punishable under the law, not simply the nonpayment of debt. Even without formal written notice of dishonor, Lopez's prior knowledge of the closed account and failure to disclose this to Ables constituted sufficient deceit to uphold the conviction.  The court affirmed the penalty imposed by the lower court, applying P.D. No. 818 and the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
