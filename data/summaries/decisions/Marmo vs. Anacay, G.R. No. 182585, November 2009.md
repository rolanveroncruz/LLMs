## Legal Document Summary: Marmo v. Anacay, G.R. No. 182585 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA Decision dismissing a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) challenging RTC Orders denying a Motion to Dismiss.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC gravely abused its discretion in denying the petitioners' Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 2919-03 for failure to implead indispensable parties (the respondent's children).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision. The RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Plaintiff's Claim:** Respondent (Anacay) filed suit for Annulment of Sale, Recovery of Title with Damages, alleging falsification of a Deed of Absolute Sale by Petitioner Josephine Marmo, leading to the transfer of property to Petitioner Danilo del Pilar. Anacay claims to be a co-owner with his deceased wife.
*   **Defendant's Argument:** Petitioners (Marmo, Esguerra, Del Pilar) argued that Anacay's children are indispensable parties as co-owners and their absence warrants dismissal under Rule 3, Section 7 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   An Order denying a motion to dismiss is interlocutory and not appealable unless grave abuse of discretion is shown.
    *   Anacay's children are not indispensable parties because the core issue is the *falsification* of Anacay's and his wife's signatures on the Deed of Absolute Sale. This issue is personal to them and their children's signatures are not on the document.
    *   Cites Article 487 of the Civil Code, stating that any co-owner may bring an action in ejectment (which includes accion publiciana and reinvindicatoria)
    *   Relies on *Vencilao v. Camarenta*, *Sering v. Plazo*, *Estreller v. Ysmael*, *Plasabas v. CA*, *Resuena v. CA*, *Celino v. Heirs of Alejo and Teresa Santiago*, and *Carandang v. Heirs of De Guzman*.
    *   Distinguishes from *Baloloy v. Hular* and *Adlawan v. Adlawan*, where the actions were brought claiming *sole* ownership of the property, which is not the case here
    *   Since Anacay acknowledges co-ownership and the suit seeks to recover ownership for all co-owners, it's presumed to benefit all co-owners and does not require impleading them.
    *   Co-owners are not even *necessary* parties.
*   **Rejection of Petitioner's Case Law:** *Arcelona v. CA*, *Orbeta v. Sendiong*, and *Galicia v. Manliquez Vda. de Mindo* are distinguished because they involved suits against a co-owner without impleading others, or claims of sole ownership affecting third parties.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision heavily relies on the presumption that the action benefits all co-owners. If evidence arises showing Anacay's actions were contrary to the children's interests, the issue of indispensable parties might be revisited in future proceedings.
*   The definition of "ejectment" in Article 487, encompassing various actions, could be challenged based on the specific nature of the claim.
*   The degree to which the court relies on the respondent's express acknowledgment of co-ownership vs. any possible *de facto* claim to sole control by him.
*   If the action for falsification fails, the underlying claims of ownership/co-ownership still need to be addressed, potentially requiring involvement of the children.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Rule 3, Section 7, Revised Rules of Court (Indispensable Parties)
*   Rule 41, Section 1, Revised Rules of Court (Appealable Orders)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the Rule 65 Petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the RTC. The key takeaway is that a co-owner can pursue an action to recover property where the claim is rooted in personal rights (like falsification of a signature) without necessarily impleading other co-owners, provided the action is deemed to benefit the co-ownership. However, this presumption is subject to potential challenges, particularly if actions are contrary to the interests of the other co-owners, or if the nature of the overall claim calls into question co-ownership.
