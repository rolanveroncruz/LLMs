**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Domingo*, G.R. No. 181475 (2009)**

**Overview:**

This is a Philippine Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Larry Domingo for Illegal Recruitment (Large Scale) under Art. 38(b) of the Labor Code and two counts of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.  The case involves allegations that Domingo, without proper licenses, recruited individuals for overseas employment in Saipan, collected fees, and failed to deploy them.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Large Scale):** Domingo was found guilty of illegal recruitment in large scale.  The Court held that the prosecution established the three elements: (1) recruitment activity as defined by Art. 13(b) of the Labor Code (canvassing, enlisting, promising employment for a fee), (2) lack of DOLE license/authority, and (3) commission against three or more persons. This constitutes economic sabotage under Art. 39 of the Labor Code.
*   **Estafa:** Domingo was also convicted of two counts of Estafa. The elements established were: (1) misrepresentation regarding the ability to secure overseas employment, (2) reliance on the misrepresentation by the victims who paid fees, and (3) resulting damages to the victims.
*   **Recantation:** The Court addressed and dismissed the recantation of one witness, Cabigao, finding it less credible than his original testimony and insufficient to overturn the convictions based on the remaining evidence.
*   **Lack of Receipts:** The absence of receipts acknowledging payment was deemed immaterial. The Court emphasized that promising employment for a fee is sufficient for a conviction for illegal recruitment, regardless of whether cash was actually given at the time.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Domingo is criminally liable for illegal recruitment (large scale) and estafa, resulting in prison sentences and fines.
*   **Civil Liability:** He is ordered to pay actual/compensatory damages to the victims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The case hinges heavily on the credibility of the witnesses. Despite Cabigao's recantation, the Court found the testimony of the remaining complainants credible. A challenge could be made regarding the consistency and corroboration of these testimonies.
*   **Proof of Payment:** While the Court found the absence of receipts non-fatal, the proof of payment relies on the testimonies of the complainants. This may be seen as contentious by Domingo.
*   **Definition of "Recruitment":** The broad definition of "recruitment" under Art. 13(b) of the Labor Code is crucial. The Court interpreted "promising employment for a fee" as sufficient, even without an actual exchange of money at the time of the promise. Domingo may argue against this broad interpretation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines:** Art. 13(b) (definition of recruitment and placement), Art. 34 (prohibited practices), Art. 38 (illegal recruitment), Art. 39 (penalties for illegal recruitment). *People v. Jamilosa, G.R. No. 169076, January 23, 2007, 512 SCRA 340, 351* - establishes the elements of illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Next Steps:**

Careful scrutiny of the trial transcripts and witness statements is needed to identify any inconsistencies or weaknesses. Domingo's legal options include filing a motion for reconsideration or petition for review, focusing on the credibility of witnesses, the interpretation of "recruitment," and the sufficiency of evidence to prove intent to defraud.
