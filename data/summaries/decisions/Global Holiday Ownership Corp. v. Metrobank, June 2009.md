**Legal Document Summary: Global Holiday Ownership Corporation v. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company**

**Case:** G.R. No. 184081, June 19, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which annulled the RTC's grant of a writ of preliminary injunction to Global, preventing Metrobank from extrajudicially foreclosing on a condominium unit.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Global obtained loans from Metrobank secured by a real estate mortgage over a condominium unit (CCT No. 29774).
*   **Debt Settlement Agreement:** Due to default, Global and Metrobank entered into a Debt Settlement Agreement on November 15, 2001, detailing payment schedules. Global again defaulted.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** Metrobank initiated extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings under Act 3135, as amended.
*   **Injunction Sought:** Global filed a complaint seeking annulment of the foreclosure and injunctive relief. The RTC granted a preliminary injunction.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed, finding Global lacked a clear legal right and that personal notice of foreclosure was not required.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Personal Notice Requirement:** Whether Metrobank's failure to provide personal notice of the foreclosure renders it void, given Paragraph 14 of the mortgage contract.
2.  **Propriety of Injunction:** Whether the RTC properly issued a writ of preliminary injunction.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reinstating the RTC's injunction.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Contractual Stipulation (Paragraph 14):** The mortgage contract contained a specific clause (Paragraph 14) requiring all correspondence, including notices of extrajudicial actions, to be sent to Global. The Court relies on the precedent set in *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Wong*, G.R. No. 120859, June 26, 2001, and subsequent cases, which held that a contractual stipulation for personal notice in addition to posting and publication is valid and enforceable. Failure to comply renders the foreclosure void.
*   **Act 3135 vs. Contractual Obligation:** While Act 3135 doesn't require personal notice, parties can contractually agree otherwise. The *Cortes v. Intermediate Appellate Court* case (G.R. No. 73678, July 21, 1989), which held a similar provision as a mere expression of general intent, was deemed superseded by *Wong* and subsequent jurisprudence.
*   **Purpose of Notice:** Paragraph 14 was designed to protect the mortgagor's rights by apprising them of impending actions. This is a bank's duty of due diligence.
*   **Debt Settlement Agreement did not waive notice:** Only the requirement of demand was waived, not personal notice under paragraph 14.
*   **No perfected contract to transfer account to SPV:** Metrobank was only 'considering' it.

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Metrobank:** Liable for breaching its contractual obligation to provide personal notice of foreclosure. Risks having foreclosure proceedings declared null and void.
*   **Global:** Still obligated to repay the debt.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Governs the procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Civil Code (Article 2088):** Prohibits the creditor from appropriating the things given by way of pledge or mortgage.
*   **Republic Act No. 9182 (Special Purpose Vehicle Act of 2002)** Governs the transfer of non-performing assets from banks to SPVs.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Wong*, G.R. No. 120859, June 26, 2001:** Establishes that contractual stipulations for personal notice in mortgage agreements are enforceable.
*   ***Cortes v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, G.R. No. 73678, July 21, 1989:** (Superseded) Argued that a general intent in a mortgage agreement cannot prevail over the provisions of Act 3135.
*   ***Union Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 164910, September 30, 2005***: Reinforced doctrine in Wong, that personal notice to mortgagor in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not necessary, unless stipulated.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Paragraph 14 of the mortgage contract: (Revolved around interpretation of general intent versus specific intent)
*   Provision in the Debt Settlement Agreement: (Revolved around whether Global had waived its right to receive personal notice to extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court has clearly stated that stipulations for personal notice of foreclosure are binding and enforceable, even if Act 3135 only requires posting and publication. Metrobank's failure to provide this notice rendered the foreclosure proceedings potentially voidable. Focus should be put on addendum or modifications of mortgage agreements if this personal notice is intended to be relinquished. Banks must adhere to their contractual obligations and exercise a heightened duty of care toward borrowers. This case underscores the importance of meticulously reviewing and interpreting mortgage contracts, especially clauses related to notice.
