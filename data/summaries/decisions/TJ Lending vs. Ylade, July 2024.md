Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *TJ Lending Investors, Inc. v. Spouses Arthur Ylade and the Register of Deeds of Manila* (G.R. No. 265651, July 31, 2024)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Issue:** Whether the CA erred in ruling that a property registered in the name of Arthur Ylade, but with the notation "married to Lita Ylade," is his exclusive property and not subject to execution to satisfy a judgment against Lita Ylade.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, ruling that the property is Arthur Ylade's exclusive property and not subject to execution. The Supreme Court further declared the execution sale of the property to TJ Lending null and void.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Conjugal Partnership Presumption (Art. 160, Civil Code):** The court examined the presumption that property acquired during marriage belongs to the conjugal partnership. The SC emphasized that the creditor, TJ Lending, failed to prove that the property was acquired during the marriage.

    *   *Relevant Case Law:* Cites *Jorge v. Marcelo*, 849 Phil. 707 (2019) which states that a statement in the TCT that the registered owner was married to another person is merely descriptive of the civil status of the owner.

    *   *Statutory Reference:* Art. 160 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.

*   **Nature of TCT Entry:** The court held that the notation "married to Lita Ylade" on Arthur's TCT is merely descriptive of his civil status and not conclusive proof of conjugal ownership. The date of registration of title cannot be automatically equated to the date of acquisition of the property.

*   **Enforcement of Money Judgments:** The court reiterated that money judgments are enforceable only against property belonging to the judgment debtor (Lita Ylade, in this case). Because the property was determined to be Arthur's separate property, the levy and subsequent execution sale were invalid.

    *   *Relevant Case Law:* Mentions remedies available to third-party claimants whose property is wrongly levied upon, referencing Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court (terceria or separate action for ownership). Cites *Villasi v. Garcia*, 724 Phil. 519, 526-527 (2014), among others, regarding the enforceability of money judgments.

    *   *Statutory Reference:* Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court.

*   **Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet:** The SC invoked the principle that one cannot give what one does not have. Because Lita had no ownership interest in the property, the execution sale could not transfer title to TJ Lending.

*   **Caveat Emptor (Execution Sales):**  The Court reiterated the principle that in execution sales, the sheriff does not warrant title, and the purchaser acquires only the judgment debtor's rights (if any).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **TJ Lending:** Is obligated to relinquish any claim to the property based on the invalid execution sale. It bears the risk associated with purchasing property at an execution sale where the judgment debtor lacked a valid interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Investment:** TJ Lending faces a complete loss of its investment in the execution sale, as it acquired no title to the property.

*   **Title Cloud:** The invalid execution sale initially created a cloud on Arthur Ylade's title, but the Supreme Court's decision removes that cloud.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key ambiguity revolved around the interpretation of the phrase "married to Lita Ylade" on the title, which TJ Lending argued was evidence of conjugal property. The Court clarified this point, holding it as merely descriptive of civil status.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision which favored the property owner (Arthur Ylade), providing clarity on the interpretation of property titles and reinforcing the principle that execution can only reach the assets of the judgment debtor.  The execution sale was declared null and void.
