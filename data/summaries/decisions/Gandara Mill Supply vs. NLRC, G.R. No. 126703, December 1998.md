**Legal Document Summary: *Gandara Mill Supply vs. NLRC and Germano***

**Case:** Gandara Mill Supply and Milagros Sy vs. The National Labor Relations Commission and Silvestre Germano, G.R. No. 126703, December 29, 1998

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing NLRC resolutions finding illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The central issue is whether Silvestre Germano was illegally dismissed by Gandara Mill Supply. The Labor Arbiter and NLRC found illegal dismissal due to a prolonged, effectively indefinite suspension following an absence related to his wife's childbirth, and failure of the employer to provide notice and a hearing.
*   **Employer's Obligation to Reinstate/Compensate:** The employer was obligated to reinstate Germano or, alternatively, pay wages and benefits during any extension of a preventative suspension exceeding 30 days (Rule XXIII, Sec. 9, Implementing Rules of the Labor Code). Failure to do so, and failure to offer reinstatement as part of settlement negotiations, contributed to the finding of illegal dismissal.
*   **Procedural Obligations:** The employer had multiple opportunities to submit a position paper to the Labor Arbiter, which it failed to do, resulting in a decision based solely on the employee's claims. This failure was considered a waiver of the right to be heard.
*   **Appeal Bond Requirement:** The employer's appeal to the NLRC was dismissed due to failure to post a cash or surety bond, a requirement for appeals from Labor Arbiter decisions. The request for exemption based on being a small business was denied.
*   **Damages:** The employer was ordered to pay P65,685.90, representing separation pay, backwages, SLIP (presumably Social Legislation Incentive Payments), and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** Gandara Mill Supply is liable for P65,685.90 in damages to Silvestre Germano.
*   **Procedural Default:** The employer's failure to submit a position paper and post the required appeal bond contributed significantly to the unfavorable outcome.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Execution of Judgment:** With the Supreme Court dismissing the Petition for Certiorari, the writ of execution issued by the NLRC is upheld, meaning assets of Gandara Mill Supply can be seized to satisfy the judgment.
*   **No Further Appeal:** The Supreme Court's decision is final, barring extraordinary circumstances that would justify reconsideration.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Governs the special civil action for certiorari.
*   **Rule XXIII, Sec. 9, Implementing Rules of the Labor Code:** Regulates preventative suspensions.
*   ***WenPhil Doctrine***: Applied *by analogy* regarding the requirements of notice and hearing prior to dismissal.  While not directly applicable (as the court deemed the situation to be a prolonged suspension), the doctrine highlights the importance of due process.
*   **Art. III, Sec. 16, The 1987 Philippine Constitution.:** Guarantees the right to a speedy disposition of cases.
*   ***Tijam v. Sibonghanoy, 23 SCRA 29***: Cited regarding the doctrine of laches.
*    ***Diosdado de Vera vs. NLRC, 191 SCRA 633 1990***: Cited regarding the principle of compassionate justice.
*    ***San Juan vs Cuento, 160 SCRA 277; Toledo vs. Pardo, 118 SCRA 566 ,1982***: Cited regarding the reasonableness of time in filing a Petition for Certiorari

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Nature of Absence:** The employer argued the absence constituted job abandonment, while the employee claimed it was due to his wife's childbirth. The Labor Arbiter sided with the employee, influenced by the employer's failure to present evidence to the contrary.
*   **Suspension vs. Dismissal:** The court found the "suspension" to be effectively a dismissal due to its indefinite nature and lack of adherence to labor regulations.  The lack of clear communication regarding reinstatement further solidified this interpretation.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The Supreme Court deemed the Petition for Certiorari to be filed out of time, although the rules did not specifically fix a period, applying the "reasonableness" standard instead.

**Overall Assessment:**

The employer's case was significantly weakened by procedural missteps (failure to file a position paper, failure to post appeal bond) and a failure to clearly communicate or adhere to legal requirements regarding employee suspensions and due process. The court ultimately sided with the employee, citing the constitutional mandate to protect labor and finding the prolonged suspension to be a de facto illegal dismissal.
