## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Cosa*, G.R. No. 116626

**Overview:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Celia Flor Cosa for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, as defined under Article 38 and penalized under Article 39(a) of the Labor Code. She was also convicted of offenses punishable under Article 39(c) of the Labor Code and several counts of Estafa. She appealed only the Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 38, Labor Code:** Defines illegal recruitment, including acts by non-licensees/non-holders of authority and prohibited practices. Specifies that illegal recruitment committed by a syndicate or in large scale constitutes economic sabotage. "Large scale" is defined as committed against three or more persons.
*   **Article 39(a), Labor Code:** Prescribes the penalty for illegal recruitment in large scale: life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00.
*   Accused, along with other officers, were deemed to have conspired to commit illegal recruitment by promising overseas employment to several individuals in exchange for fees without the required license or authority from the Department of Labor.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused was obligated to possess a valid license or authority from the DOLE to engage in recruitment activities.
*   The accused was obligated to deploy the complainants overseas as promised, or refund the fees paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.
*   **Penalty:** Life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00. The lower court failed to impose the fine, and the Supreme Court rectified this.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   The appellant attempted to argue that she was merely a "low-key employee," not a principal in the illegal recruitment scheme. This was refuted by witness testimony and documentary evidence identifying her as the treasurer of Japs International Trading Corporation.
*   The core risk identified is the potential for accomplice liability, even if the accused had argued she was not the treasurer and merely acted on behalf of the corporate officers.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 38 and 39:** Central statutes governing illegal recruitment. The court cited *People vs. Cabacang, 246 SCRA 530* in relation to proving large scale recruitment.
*   **People vs. Jumao-as, 230 SCRA 70:** This case is cited for the principle that trial courts are in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While there are no specific clauses, the central contentious issue was the appellant's role in the recruitment activities and whether she was a principal or merely an employee acting on instructions. The Court found her to be a conspirator, regardless of her exact title.
