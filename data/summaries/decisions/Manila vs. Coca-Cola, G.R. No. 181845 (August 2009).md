## Legal Document Summary: *City of Manila vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.*

**Case:** *City of Manila, et al. vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 181845, August 4, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA en banc's dismissal of the City of Manila's Petition for Review.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of Manila's assessment of Coca-Cola for deficiency local business taxes under Section 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794, as purportedly amended by Tax Ordinances No. 7988 and No. 8011. Focuses on procedural timeliness of appeal to CTA and the validity of the tax assessment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Tax Ordinance No. 7794 (as originally enacted):** Section 14 imposes a tax on manufacturers. Section 21 imposes a tax on businesses subject to excise/VAT/percentage taxes under the NIRC, but *exempts* businesses already paying tax under other sections of the ordinance.
*   **Tax Ordinances No. 7988 & 8011:** Amendments to Tax Ordinance No. 7794. Specifically, they delete the exemption proviso in Section 21. These were previously declared null and void in *Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila* (G.R. No. 156252).
*   **Republic Act No. 9282, Section 11:** Governs appeals to the CTA, requiring a Petition for Review within 30 days of receipt of an adverse decision.
*   **Revised Rules of the CTA, Rule 8, Section 3(a):**  Mirrors RA 9282, Section 11, reiterating the 30-day period for filing a Petition for Review.
*   **Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 42, Section 1 (Suppletory):** Applied by analogy, allows for extensions to the 30-day period for filing a petition, initially 15 days and, for compelling reasons, a further 15 days.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **City of Manila's Liability:** Potential liability for improper tax assessment due to the nullity of Tax Ordinances No. 7988 and 8011 and the double taxation issue.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** The City of Manila failed to strictly adhere to the Revised Rules of the CTA regarding the number of copies required for filing and the submission of certified copies of documents. This risked dismissal on procedural grounds, even if the substantive arguments had merit.
*   **Double Taxation:** The Court found that assessing Coca-Cola under both Sections 14 and 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794 constituted double taxation, as it was the same business being taxed twice for the same activity.
*   **Reliance on Invalid Ordinances:** The city assessed taxes based on ordinances already declared null and void.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC), Section 143:** Source of the municipality/city's power to impose business taxes. Cited regarding the limitations on imposing taxes under subsections (a) and (h).
*   ***Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila* (G.R. No. 156252):** Crucial precedent declaring Tax Ordinances No. 7988 and 8011 null and void.

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Referenced in Section 21 of Tax Ordinance 7794 re: excise, VAT, and percentage taxes.
*   **Revised Rules of the CTA:** Rules governing procedure in the Court of Tax Appeals.
*   **Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 42:** Governs appeals to the CA and applied suppletorily to CTA.
*  **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of Commerce, G.R. No. 149636, 8 June 2005, 459 SCRA 638, 655:** Defines double taxation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of the exemption proviso in Section 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794, particularly its interaction with the subsequent (invalid) amendments.
*   Whether the *Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila* case was "doctrinal" and constituted the "law of the case," binding on future actions.
*   The permissibility of imposing taxes under both Sections 14 and 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794, considering potential double taxation.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court denied the City of Manila's Petition. The Court held that although the CTA erred in dismissing the initial appeal as untimely, the dismissal was ultimately correct because (1) the City failed to follow the proper filing procedure, and (2) the City's tax assessment was improper due to the invalidity of the amendments to the tax ordinance and the resulting double taxation.
