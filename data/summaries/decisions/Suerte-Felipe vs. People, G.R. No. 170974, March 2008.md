**Legal Document Summary: *Suerte-Felipe v. People*, G.R. No. 170974 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Romeo I. Suerte-Felipe was charged with homicide for the death of Godofredo Ariate, alleging he "willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shot" Ariate with a firearm.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Suerte-Felipe, accompanied by two police officers (Madriago & Jimeno), argued with Ariate. Suerte-Felipe allegedly shot Ariate multiple times, then shot a witness, Rodolfo Alumbres. Witnesses: Alumbres, William Ariate (son), and Barangay Chairman Pio Arce.
*   **Defense's Version:** Ariate and his companions (including Arce and William Ariate) attacked and stabbed Suerte-Felipe. Arce fired at Suerte-Felipe, Madriago, and Jimeno. Suerte-Felipe drew his .45 caliber firearm in self-defense and accidentally fired it upwards. Danilo Villa corroborated the defense. Medical records of Suerte-Felipe's injuries were stipulated.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Suerte-Felipe guilty of homicide, sentenced him to 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years of *reclusion temporal*, ordered him to pay the heirs of Ariate P50,000 as indemnity, P21,800 as actual damages, and costs.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modification, adding P50,000 in moral damages.

**Arguments on Appeal (Petitioner Suerte-Felipe):**

1.  **Chain of Custody/Identification:** Doubts about whether the body autopsied was actually Godofredo Ariate's.
2.  **Causation:** Doubts that the slug recovered was from a fatal wound that killed Ariate.
3.  **Ballistics:** Doubts that the slug came from Suerte-Felipe's .45 firearm.
4.  **Credibility of Defense Witnesses:** Erroneous dismissal of Suerte-Felipe's testimony as confused and Danilo Villa's testimony as planted.
5.  **Credibility of Prosecution Witnesses:** Erroneous reliance on the testimonies of Rodolfo Alumbres and Pio Arce, despite their lack of credibility.

**Supreme Court (SC) Rationale:**

*   **Physical Evidence:** Physical evidence is not indispensable for a conviction.
*   **Identification:** Certificate of Identification of Dead Body is *prima facie* evidence under Rule 132, Sections 19 & 23 of the Rules of Court, and the victim's son identified the body.
*   **Ballistics:** Although the specific .45 firearm wasn't matched, the recovered slug *was* identified as coming from a .45 caliber weapon. The Court noted that the slug was recovered from a wound near the upper stomach, in contradiction of Suerte-Felipe's account.
*   **Testimonial Evidence:** Trial court findings on witness credibility are given great weight. The SC affirmed the RTC's assessment of Suerte-Felipe's testimony as inconsistent and Villa's as rehearsed. Any inconsistencies were minor and did not take away from the credibility of the witnesses.
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity, actual damages (supported by receipts), and moral damages are all justified.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition and AFFIRMED the CA decision.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Suerte-Felipe is liable for Homicide.
*   He must pay P50,000 as indemnity, P21,800 as actual damages, and P50,000 as moral damages to the heirs of Godofredo Ariate. He also has a jail sentence to serve.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** The SC relied heavily on circumstantial evidence (especially the location of the fatal wound) and inferences, despite the lack of a definitive match between the recovered slug and Suerte-Felipe's specific firearm.
*   **Contradictory Testimony:** While dismissing minor inconsistencies in the prosecution's testimony, the defense claimed that the trial court ignored clear problems with the prosection.
*   **Missing Firearm:** The loss of Suerte-Felipe's gun is suspicious and raises questions about possible concealment of evidence. The SC's justification for the missing firearm is not strong.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Sections 19 & 23:**  Public documents as evidence (Certificate of Identification of Dead Body).
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 133, Section 4:** Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient.
*   **People v. Buban, G.R. No. 170471:** Moral damages in violent death cases are fixed at P50,000.00

**For a Lawyer:**

This case hinges on the weight given to testimonial evidence and the inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence. The absence of a definitive ballistic match weakens the prosecution's case, but the courts found the witness testimonies and the circumstances (especially the location of the wound) sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Consider the strength of an appeal based on the lack of direct evidence and the challenges to the credibility of prosecution witnesses, as well as the defense of self-defense.
