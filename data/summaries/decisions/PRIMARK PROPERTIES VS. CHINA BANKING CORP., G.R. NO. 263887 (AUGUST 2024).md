**Case:** *Philippine Primark Properties, Inc. v. China Banking Corporation Trust and Assets Management Group* (G.R. No. 263887, August 19, 2024)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of an interpleader complaint and cross-claims.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Philippine Primark Properties, Inc. (Primark)
*   **Respondent:** China Banking Corporation Trust and Assets Management Group (CBC-TAMG)
*   **Interpleader Plaintiff (Not a party to this appeal, but central to the facts):** BDO Unibank, Inc. (BDO)
*   **China Banking Corporation (CBC) and China Bank Savings, Inc. (CBSI)**

**Background Facts:**

*   Primark entered into an Omnibus Notes Facility and Security Agreement (ONFSA) with CBC and CBSI (the Banks) for a PHP 7 billion loan facility.
*   To secure the loan, Primark assigned its receivables from lease contracts (specifically with BDO) to CBC-TAMG as security trustee/assignee. BDO was notified of the assignment.
*   The ONFSA also required Primark to maintain a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).
*   Primark later claimed the ONFSA was void *ab initio* for violating DOSRI rules (Section 36 of the General Banking Law) and notified CBC and CBC-TAMG of its abrogation.
*   Primark defaulted on its loan obligations.
*   CBC-TAMG, claiming its right under the Security Assignment, instructed BDO to pay rental payments directly to it.
*   Primark told BDO to ignore CBC-TAMG's instructions, leading to conflicting claims.
*   BDO filed an interpleader complaint in RTC (Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC) to determine the rightful recipient of rental payments.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   The RTC dismissed BDO's interpleader complaint, CBC-TAMG's cross-claims against Primark, and all counterclaims.
*   Basis: CBC-TAMG lacked legal capacity to be sued (not a juridical person) and was not a real party-in-interest. The court reasoned CBC-TAMG was merely a department of CBC.

**CA Ruling (Reversed by this Supreme Court Decision):**

*   Reversed the RTC decision.
*   Held that CBC-TAMG *did* have the capacity to sue and be sued, as it performs trust functions and possesses the general powers incident to corporations under Section 83 of the General Banking Law.
*   Found CBC-TAMG to be a real party-in-interest, authorized to collect receivables and institute suits to prevent their impairment under the ONFSA.
*   Held Primark was estopped from questioning CBC-TAMG's legal capacity.
*   Remanded the case to the RTC for further proceedings on CBC-TAMG's counterclaims and cross-claims.
*   Ordered the first interpleader case consolidated with BDO's second interpleader case where CBC was impleaded as defendant.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Granted Primark's Petition for Review and reversed the CA decision.**
*   **Key Holdings/Reasoning:**

    1.  **Improper Remedy:** The RTC's dismissal based on lack of legal capacity was a dismissal *without prejudice*. Under Rule 41, Section 1(g) of the Rules of Court, such an order is *not appealable*; the proper remedy was a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65. The CA erred in giving due course to CBC-TAMG's appeal.
    2.  **Scope of CA Reversal**: The Supreme Court clarified that while the CA decision reversed the RTC Order, this was only for the purpose of hearing the counterclaim and cross-claim of CBC-TAMG. The decision did not reinstate BDO's first interpleader case, as BDO did not appeal the dismissal.

    3.  **CBC-TAMG's Lack of Legal Capacity:**
        *   CBC-TAMG is *not* a juridical person under Article 44 of the Civil Code. It's not a corporation and was not created by operation of law.
        *   While banks can engage in trust business through a trust department (Sections 79 and 412 of the General Banking Law and MORB), this doesn't confer separate juridical personality on the department itself.  The *bank* is the "trust entity."
        *   Section 83 of the General Banking Law refers to the powers of a "trust entity" (i.e., the duly authorized *bank*), not the trust department. The trust entity already possesses general corporate powers under the Revised Corporation Code and Section 83 merely grants specific powers relating to trust administration, in addition to those already conferred.
        *   American jurisprudence confirms this view: separate departments within a bank are not independent entities, but are part of a single corporation.
        *   The separation of the trust business is required to protect the beneficiary, not to create a separate legal entity. The Bank has a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary of the trust.
        *   Therefore, CBC-TAMG lacks the legal capacity to sue independently of CBC.

    4.  **Proper Forum:** BDO already filed a second interpleader case impleading *CBC*, which is the appropriate forum for resolving the disputes. Allowing CBC-TAMG to litigate separately would lead to forum shopping.
    5.  Given the second interpleader case, the Court no longer found the need to further discuss the issue on lack of personality to sue and estoppel on the part of Primark.

**Disposition:**

*   The Supreme Court granted the petition.
*   The CA decision and resolution were reversed and set aside.
*   CBC-TAMG's counterclaim and cross-claim in the first interpleader case (Civil Case No. R-MKT-20-01679-SC) were dismissed for lack of capacity to sue.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 36 of the General Banking Law (DOSRI rules):** Implicated in Primark's initial claim of *void ab initio* status of ONFSA.
*   **Section 79 & 83 of the General Banking Law:** Critical sections dealing with the authority to engage in trust business and powers of a trust entity, respectively. The interpretation of these sections was central to determining CBC-TAMG's legal capacity.
*   **Rule 3, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Who may be parties in a civil action.
*   **Article 44 of the Civil Code:** Juridical persons.
*   **Rule 41, Section 1(g) of the Rules of Court:** Regarding the non-appealability of orders dismissing an action without prejudice.
*   **Legal Capacity to Sue vs. Lack of Personality to Sue:**  The Court emphasizes the distinction.
*   **Fiduciary Duty of a Trustee (Bank) towards the Beneficiary:** A core principle influencing the court's view on the separation of trust functions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The main risk identified in the document is that CBC-TAMG, as an entity without a distinct juridical personality from its parent bank, might face challenges in initiating legal actions on its own behalf. This ambiguity could lead to future legal complications.
*   There may be questions regarding the practical implications of having two simultaneous interpleader cases.
*   The ONFSA itself contains clauses regarding default, security assignments, and debt service reserve accounts. The validity of those clauses (especially considering Primark's DOSRI arguments) may still be subject to challenge in the second interpleader case.

This summary provides a concise, legally precise overview of the document, highlighting the key issues, rulings, and potential risks. Remember that a comprehensive legal analysis would require examining the entire record and relevant case law in greater depth.
