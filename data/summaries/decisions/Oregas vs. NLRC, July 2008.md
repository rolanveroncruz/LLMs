**Legal Document Summary: _Oregas v. NLRC, 581 Phil. 139 (2008)_**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC's resolution. The core issue is whether FVA Manpower Training Center & Services (FVA) is an independent contractor and consequently, the employer of Petitioners Oregas, Hilario, and Arboleda, or whether Dusit Hotel Nikko (Dusit) is their employer.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Independent Contractor Status of FVA:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the lower courts' finding that FVA is a legitimate independent contractor based on evidence including:
    *   DOLE and DTI registration.
    *   Existence of a Contract for Services between FVA and Dusit.
    *   FVA's provision of services to other clients.
    *   FVA's capitalisation.
    *   FVA provides employee uniforms and lockers
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship Test (Four-Fold Test):** SC applied the four-fold test to determine that FVA was the employer:
    *   *Selection and Engagement:* Petitioners applied and signed employment contracts with FVA.
    *   *Payment of Wages:* FVA paid petitioners' salaries, billed Dusit for services. FVA registered employees with Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Social Security System.
    *   *Power of Dismissal:* FVA recalled petitioners from Dusit.
    *   *Control:* FVA assigned a supervisor to monitor performance at Dusit, petitioners maintained time records with FVA.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The NLRC found, and the CA affirmed, that when FVA recalled the petitioners from Dusit and failed to provide subsequent assignments for a period exceeding six months, it constituted constructive dismissal.
*   **Separation Pay:** As a consequence of the constructive dismissal, FVA was ordered to pay separation pay of one-half month pay for every year of service to the Petitioners.

**Obligations:**

*   FVA is obligated to pay separation pay to Oregas, Hilario, and Arboleda as specified in the NLRC resolution.

**Liabilities:**

*   FVA is liable for the separation pay based on the constructive dismissal finding.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Petitioners risk being unable to claim regularization or benefits from Dusit due to the SC's affirmation that FVA is the employer.
*   The finding of constructive dismissal could potentially expose FVA to additional claims for damages if the dismissal was handled improperly.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Limits the scope of review on certiorari to questions of law.
*   **Four-Fold Test:**  The case reiterates the standard test for determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Recall vs. Termination:** The document details a finding of constructive dismissal.
