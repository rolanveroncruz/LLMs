Here's a concise legal summary of the *Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) vs. Court of Appeals, Ayala Corporation and Ayala Land, Inc.* case:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court consolidated two petitions (G.R. Nos. 126000 & 128520) arising from a suit filed by MWSS seeking to nullify a 1983 sale of land to SILHOUETTE Trading Corporation (assignee of Capitol Hills Golf & Country Club Inc - CHGCCI), and subsequent conveyance of a portion of that land by SILHOUETTE to Ayala Corporation.  MWSS argued the sale and subsequent conveyances were void due to alleged fraud and undue influence exerted by then-President Marcos and MWSS officers, and the lack of written authority for the initial agreement between MWSS and CHGCCI.

**Key Provisions and Events:**

*   **1965 Lease:** MWSS (formerly NAWASA) leased land to CHGCCI with a right of first refusal.
*   **LOI 440 (1976):** Marcos directed MWSS to negotiate cancellation of the lease for disposition of the property.
*   **1980/81 Appraisal:** Asian Appraisal Co., Inc. valued the property at P40.00/sqm.
*   **1982 Marcos Approval:** Marcos indicated approval on a letter from CHGCCI re: the agreed sale.
*   **1983 MWSS Resolution 36-83:** MWSS approved sale to SILHOUETTE (assignee of CHGCCI) for P40/sqm, with conditions of payment; General Manager Ilustre authorized to sign.
*   **1983 Sales Agreement:** Formal agreement between MWSS and SILHOUETTE.
*   **1984 Conveyance to Ayala:** SILHOUETTE sold a portion of the land to Ayala at P110.00/sqm.
*   **1993 MWSS Lawsuit:** Filed to nullify the sale, alleging fraud and illegality.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED MWSS's petitions, upholding the lower courts' dismissal of the complaint against Ayala. The Court ruled:

1.  **Prescription:** MWSS's action was time-barred.  The Court determined that the alleged defects, even if true, rendered the contracts *voidable* (not void ab initio) due to vitiated consent (undue influence or fraud).  Therefore, the four-year prescriptive period under Article 1391 of the Civil Code applied, calculated from either the cessation of the undue influence (Marcos's ouster in 1986) or the discovery of the fraud (date of execution/registration of deeds in 1983/84).  The suit filed in 1993 was beyond the prescriptive period. The absence of written authority does not render the initial agreement invalid.
2.  **Laches:** Even if the contracts were *void ab initio* (and thus imprescriptible), MWSS was barred by laches due to its unreasonable delay (10 years) in asserting its rights, knowing of the sale, and accepting payments.
3.  **Ratification:** MWSS ratified the sale by accepting payments, issuing demand letters, and passing Resolution No. 36-83.  General Manager Ilustre was authorized to sign for and in behalf of the MWSS.
4.  **Non-Joinder of Indispensable Parties:** The suit affected the rights of numerous lot owners in Ayala Heights Subdivision who were not joined as defendants, making the action defective. Their absence renders all subsequent actions null and void for want of authority to act

**Key Legal Principles Applied:**

*   **Void vs. Voidable Contracts:**  The distinction is critical for determining the prescriptive period. The court found the agreements to be *voidable* (vitiated consent), not *void ab initio*. *Tolentino, IV Tolentino, 1991 ed., p. 596.*
*   **Article 1391, Civil Code:**  Prescriptive period for annulment of voidable contracts (4 years).
*   **Laches:** An equitable defense barring a claim due to unreasonable delay. *Nielson & Co. v. Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co., 18 SCRA 1040*
*   **Ratification:**  Validation of an unauthorized act; can be express or implied. *Prime White Cement Corporation v. IAC, 220 SCRA 103*
*   **Indispensable Parties:**  Parties with such an interest that no final judgment can be rendered without affecting them. *Acting Registrars of Land Titles and Deeds of Pasay City, Pasig, and Makati v. RTC Branch 57, Makati, 184 SCRA 622*

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Third-Party Claims:** The Court highlighted the impact on lot owners. Future actions by these parties may arise based on arguments related to good faith purchasers for value.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** Allegations of undue influence by President Marcos create a perception of impropriety, even though legally insufficient to invalidate the transaction.
*   **Damage Claims:** Future parties could seek damages (e.g. for investments made on the basis of sale contract) from any liable party.
