## Legal Document Summary: Lucas v. Tuaño, G.R. No. 178763, April 21, 2009

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' ruling, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's dismissal of a medical negligence complaint filed by Peter Paul Patrick Lucas, his wife Fatima, and their children against Dr. Prospero Ma. C. Tuaño.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Patient-Doctor Relationship:** Dr. Tuaño, an ophthalmologist, treated Peter for conjunctivitis and subsequent Epidemic Kerato Conjunctivitis (EKC) between September and December 1988.
*   **Treatment:** Dr. Tuaño prescribed Maxitrol (a steroid-based eye drop) for Peter's EKC, which was used intermittently over several months. He also prescribed Blephamide as an alternative.
*   **Alleged Negligence:** Petitioners claim Dr. Tuaño was negligent in prescribing Maxitrol for prolonged periods without monitoring Peter's intraocular pressure (IOP), leading to steroid-induced glaucoma and permanent vision impairment. They allege Dr. Tuaño dismissed Peter's concerns about the risks of prolonged steroid use.
*   **Defense:** Dr. Tuaño argued that the treatment was appropriate, steroid-induced glaucoma is temporary, he monitored IOP through palpation, and any glaucoma was likely pre-existing and unmasked by the steroid use.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** Both the RTC and Court of Appeals ruled against the petitioners, finding insufficient evidence of negligence and failure to establish a causal link between Dr. Tuaño's actions and Peter's glaucoma. Notably, petitioners did not present expert medical testimony.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The core issue is whether Dr. Tuaño breached his duty of care to Peter and if that breach proximately caused Peter's glaucoma. To establish medical negligence, the petitioners need to prove:
    *   **Duty:** The standard of care required of an ophthalmologist in treating EKC with steroids.
    *   **Breach:** That Dr. Tuaño's actions fell below that standard.
    *   **Causation:** That Dr. Tuaño's negligence directly caused Peter's glaucoma.
    *   **Damages:** That actual damages resulted from the injury.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Expert Testimony:** The critical flaw in the petitioners' case is the absence of expert medical testimony to establish the standard of care and whether Dr. Tuaño deviated from it. This lack of expert testimony is fatal to establishing both breach of duty and causation. This is crucial because assessing medical standards and causation requires specialized knowledge beyond the ken of laypersons.
*   **Causation Issue:** The causal link between the Maxitrol use and the glaucoma is tenuous. The decision notes that Peter was diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma, often asymptomatic, and that the steroid treatment may have simply revealed a pre-existing condition. This emphasizes the need for expert testimony to establish a direct causal connection.
*   **Palpation vs. Tonometer:**  The court accepted Dr. Tuaño's testimony that he monitored IOP via palpation.  The petitioners could have argued that this method was insufficient or outdated, but the failure to present an expert witness to challenge this weakens their case.
*  **The 5% factor:** The plaintiffs argued that because Dr. Tuano knew 5% of the population reacts adversely to Maxitrol, he should have first determined if Peter belonged to that 5%. However, plaintiffs never proved that determining if a patient belonged to that 5% was the standard procedure physicians followed. 

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2176 of the Civil Code:** Basis for the quasi-delict claim (negligence).
*   **Garcia-Rueda v. Pascasio (278 SCRA 769 (1997))**: Establishes the four essential elements of medical negligence (duty, breach, injury, proximate causation).
*   **Dr. Cruz v. Court of Appeals (346 Phil. 872 (1997))**: Reinforces the importance of expert medical testimony in establishing negligence.
*   **Rule 133, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court**: Defines "preponderance of evidence."
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 36**: Witness can testify only to what they personally know of.

**Conclusion:**

The Court ultimately denied the petition, upholding the lower courts' decisions because the petitioners failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Dr. Tuaño was negligent and that his negligence caused Peter's glaucoma. The absence of expert medical testimony was a decisive factor. The case underscores the importance of expert witnesses in medical malpractice suits to establish the standard of care, breach of duty, and causation.
