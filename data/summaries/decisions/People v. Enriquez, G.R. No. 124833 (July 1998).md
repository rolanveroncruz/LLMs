**Legal Document Summary: People v. Enriquez, G.R. No. 124833, July 20, 1998 (354 Phil. 659)**

**Case Overview:** This is a criminal case appeal where Romeo Enriquez was convicted of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for the stabbing death of Eduardo Tupig. The trial court sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay Php 50,000.00 in damages to the victim's heirs. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Enriquez was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The killing was qualified by treachery because the victim was stabbed from behind in a sudden and unexpected attack, rendering him defenseless.
*   **Positive Identification:** The eyewitness testimony of Manuel Biasa, despite initial inconsistencies, was deemed credible and sufficient for conviction. Biasa positively identified Enriquez as the stabber. The Court cited *People v. Dinglasan, 267 SCRA 26 (1997)*, and *People v. Amania, 248 SCRA 286 (1995)*,  emphasizing that positive identification prevails over alibi and denial when the witness lacks ill motive.

**Obligations:**

*   **Imprisonment:** Enriquez is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Financial Obligation:** Enriquez is obligated to pay Php 50,000.00 in damages to the heirs of the victim, Eduardo Tupig.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for damages to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Recantation/Inconsistency:** Biasa initially provided a statement exculpating Enriquez. The defense argued that the initial statement should be considered over the later statements implicating Enriquez. However, the Court gave more weight to Biasa's later sworn statements and his testimony in court.
*   **Single Witness Testimony:** The conviction relies heavily on the testimony of a single witness, Manuel Biasa. The defense could potentially challenge the sufficiency of this evidence, although the court, citing *Bautista v. Court of Appeals*, held that a single credible witness is sufficient for conviction.
*   **Lack of Corroboration (Defense):** The defense's claim of an attack by a group of ten men was weak due to the lack of corroborating evidence and the failure of Enriquez to identify any of the attackers.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **People v. Dinglasan, 267 SCRA 26 (1997):** Established that positive identification prevails over alibi and denial.
*   **People v. Amania, 248 SCRA 286 (1995):** Similar holding on positive identification.
*   **Bautista v. Court of Appeals:** Held that a single credible witness is sufficient for conviction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
The only ambiguity is the conflicting statements by the witness. However, the court resolved this by giving more weight to the statement that was consistent with the testimony.

**Recommendations:**
The conviction was affirmed, so there are no recommendations at this time.
