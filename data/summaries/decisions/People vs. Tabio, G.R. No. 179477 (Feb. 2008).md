## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tabio*, G.R. No. 179477

**Case Overview:** This is a review of a conviction for three counts of rape initially decided by the RTC and affirmed with modifications by the CA. The Supreme Court ultimately found the defendant guilty of only ONE count of simple rape.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant Jimmy Tabio was charged with three counts of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) and penalized under Article 266-B, paragraph 6(10) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Duplicity of Offenses:** The Supreme Court noted a potential duplicity of offenses in the information because three separate acts of rape were charged in one information. However, because the appellant did not interpose a timely objection, the Court held this ground was waived per Rule 117, Sec. 9 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The Court held that the qualifying circumstance of knowing the victimâ€™s mental disability was not specifically alleged in the Information as required by Rule 110, Sections 8 and 9 of the Rules of Court and *People v. Limio, G.R. Nos. 148804-06, 27 May 2004, 429 SCRA 597*. The absence of this specific allegation precluded a conviction for qualified rape.
*   **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** While the Court affirmed the defendant's guilt for the *first* rape, based on the testimony of the victim, AAA, the Court found the prosecution failed to prove the *second and third* rapes beyond a reasonable doubt. The testimony concerning these subsequent acts was deemed too generalized and lacked specific details.
*   **Victim Credibility:** Despite the victim's mental retardation, her testimony regarding the first rape was deemed credible due to its clarity, frankness, and consistency. The Court also noted that her mental deficiency lends credibility to her testimony
*   **Alibi Defense:** The defendant's alibi was rejected due to being evasive and vague and could be traversed in less than an hour.
*   **Penalty:** The Court sentenced the defendant to *reclusion perpetua* for one count of simple rape.
*   **Damages:** The Court affirmed the CA's reduction of civil indemnity to P50,000.00 (the appropriate amount for simple rape), upheld the award of P50,000.00 for moral damages, and upheld the award of P25,000.00 for exemplary damages, specifically citing the provision that moral damages are awarded without any proof other than the fact of rape.

**Obligations:**

*   Defendant: To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Defendant: Civil liability for civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Duplicity Waiver:** The waiver of the duplicity of offenses could have presented a challenge.
*   **Victim testimony of second and third rape:** While the first rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt, the Court held that the prosecution failed to prove the *second and third* rapes beyond a reasonable doubt, resulting in only one count of rape.
*   **Sentencing error:** In awarding damages, the Court noted the Court of Appeals implicitly awarded P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for *all three counts* of simple rape, when this would have been an improper award. Still, because appellant is guilty of one count of simple rape, P50,000.00 still emerges as the appropriate amount of civil indemnity.
