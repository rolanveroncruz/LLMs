## Legal Document Summary: People v. CCC (G.R. No. 231925)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for two counts of qualified rape.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding CCC (father of the victim, AAA) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353, in relation to RA 7610.
*   **Elements of Rape Established:** The SC held that the elements of rape were established. Although actual force is typically an element, it is not required when the offender is the victim's father, as his moral ascendancy substitutes for violence and intimidation (citing *People v. Fragante*). The victim's age (15 at the time of the offenses) and the offender's paternity were crucial in establishing "qualified rape."
*   **Credibility of Victim:** The SC gave weight to the victim's testimony, finding it detailed and consistent. They also found her motive to be credible, and that any prior ill-feeling between victim and abuser would be inconsequential. The court cited *People v. Malana* on appellate courts generally deferring to trial courts on matters of witness credibility.
*   **Defense Rejected:** CCC's defenses of denial and alibi were rejected as weak and insufficient to overcome the victim's testimony. *People v. Abulon* was cited regarding the requirements for a successful alibi defense.
*   **Penalty:** The SC affirmed the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of qualified rape. Because circumstances were present warranting the imposition of the death penalty, but R.A. 9346 prohibited it, it was ordered that the reclusion perpetua be without eligibility for parole (pursuant to A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC).
*   **Multiple Rapes:** The SC agreed with the CA's finding that the prosecution had proven two counts of rape, despite a single Information, because the accused failed to object to it before trial.
*   **Nomenclature Correction:** The SC clarified that the proper charge is qualified rape under Art. 266-A(1), in relation to Art. 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, not specifically RA 7610.
*   **Damages:** The SC increased the damages awarded per *People v. Jugueta* to P100,000 for civil indemnity, P100,000 for moral damages, and P100,000 for exemplary damages per count. It was also ordered that a 6% interest per annum from the date of finality be applied until full payment of the amount.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The single Information issue might be raised again at some point, although the court deemed it waived due to the failure to object pre-trial.
*   **Parole Eligibility:** The phrase "without eligibility for parole" has specific implications and should be carefully monitored for any future legal challenges or interpretations.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** Ensuring proper execution of the judgment, particularly regarding the payment of damages and the crediting of preventive detention.
