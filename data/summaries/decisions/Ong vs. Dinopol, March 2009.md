**Case Summary: Ong v. Dinopol, A.M. NO. RTJ-07-2052**

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against Judge Oscar E. Dinopol for Gross Violation of R.A. 9262, Judicial Ethics, Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Judgement and Unduly Delaying Resolution of a Motion to Inhibit in Civil Case No. 1632.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Civil Case No. 1632:** Action for declaration of nullity of marriage or legal separation and damages filed by Lorena Ong against Domingo Ong. Involved a dispute over child custody (Lorenzo and Maria Monica).
*   **Complainant's Allegations:**
    *   Violations of R.A. No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004) particularly Sections 18, 20 and 28. Failure to act on the application for protection order with appropriate speed.
    *   Gross violation of judicial ethics.
    *   Knowingly rendering unjust judgement.
    *   Unduly delaying resolution of her motion to inhibit.
*   **Disputed Orders:** Judge Dinopol initially granted temporary custody of the daughter (Maria Monica) to the mother, Lorena. Later, after interviewing the children *ex parte*, Judge Dinopol reversed the order, citing the children's preference to stay with their father and the mother's enrollment in nursing school which takes time away from the children. Respondent ordered a *status quo ante*.
*   **Social Worker Recommendation:** Recommended neuro-psychiatric evaluation for both parents and a trial custody arrangement. Initially Domingo should have custody from Monday-Friday afternoons and Lorena from Friday evening to Sunday.
*   **Motion for Inhibition:** Lorena filed a motion to inhibit, alleging partiality towards Domingo. Judge Dinopol denied the motion, leading to this administrative complaint.
*   **Judge Dinopol's Defense:** Justified the reversal based on the children's expressed preferences and the social worker's report. He also states that he was initially granting Lorena custody, thus there is no bias.

**Analysis & Potential Issues:**

*   **Ex Parte Communication:** The *ex parte* interview with the children raises serious ethical concerns. This is not an accepted or standard procedure. The court should not communicate with parties without appropriate notice to allow the opposing side to be present.
*   **Judicial Discretion vs. Abuse of Discretion:** The case hinges on whether Judge Dinopol's actions constituted a legitimate exercise of judicial discretion or an abuse thereof. The Supreme Court emphasized that perceived errors in judicial discretion should be addressed via appeal or certiorari, not through administrative complaints unless there is fraud, dishonesty, corruption, or bad faith.
*   **R.A. 9262:** Lorena's claim that Judge Dinopol violated R.A. 9262 by not acting promptly on her motion for a protection order is weakened by her own admission that the judge initially acted favorably on her motion.
*   **Canon 4, Section 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:**
    The Judge violated this cannon by entertaining litigant Domingo in his home to discuss case matters.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court dismissed the administrative complaint due to insufficient evidence of fraud, dishonesty, corruption, or bad faith.
*   Judge Dinopol was reminded and warned against entertaining litigants outside the court premises, citing Canon 4, Section 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct (avoiding impropriety and the appearance of impropriety). Citing *State Prosecutors v. Muro, A.M. No. RTJ-92-876* to underscore the importance of a judge being beyond suspicion.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004): Sections 18, 20, and 28.
*   The Family Code: Article 213.
*   P.D. No. 603: Article 8.
*   New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, Canon 4, Section 1.

**Potential Risks & Obligations:**

*   **Risk of Future Complaints:** Judge Dinopol risks further administrative complaints if he fails to adhere to the warning regarding communication with litigants outside of court.
*   **Obligation to Maintain Impartiality:** Judges have a continuing obligation to maintain impartiality and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

**Case Law:**

*   *State Prosecutors v. Muro, A.M. No. RTJ-92-876*: Emphasizes the need for judges to be not only pure but also beyond suspicion.
*   *Datuin, Jr. v. Soriano, A.M. No. RTJ-01-1640*: Burden of proof in administrative proceedings lies with the complainant, and the presumption of regularity in the performance of a judge's functions must be overcome.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The appropriateness and legality of the judge's *ex parte* interview with the children.
*   Whether the judge's actions constituted a legitimate exercise of judicial discretion or an abuse thereof.
