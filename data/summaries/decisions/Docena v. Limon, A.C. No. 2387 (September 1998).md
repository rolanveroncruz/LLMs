## Legal Document Summary: *Docena v. Limon*, A.C. No. 2387 (1998)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Dominador Q. Limon, Sr. for malpractice, gross misconduct, and violation of attorney's oath, ultimately resulting in disbarment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Factual Background:** Atty. Limon, representing Docena in a forcible entry appeal, misrepresented the need for a P10,000 supersedeas bond to stay execution. He collected funds from Docena under the pretense of posting this bond, but never did so.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Atty. Limon falsely claimed the money was needed for deposit in court and later attempted to characterize the funds as attorney's fees, a claim directly contradicted by his own prior written communication.
*   **Breach of Duty:** The Court found Atty. Limon breached his duty to account for client funds (Canon 16, Rule 16.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility) and engaged in dishonest conduct (Canon 1, Rule 1.01).

**Obligations:**

*   Atty. Limon had a fiduciary duty to his client, Docena, to honestly manage and account for funds entrusted to him for a specific purpose (posting a supersedeas bond).
*   Atty. Limon was obligated to return the P8,500 he misappropriated from his client.

**Liabilities:**

*   Disbarment: The Court deemed Atty. Limon's conduct sufficiently egregious to warrant removal from the Roll of Attorneys.
*   Monetary Liability:  Atty. Limon is liable to Docena for the outstanding P8,500.00 with legal interest from the date of demand.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Monetary Judgment:**  Collecting the P8,500.00 owed to Docena may require further legal action and potential difficulties in recovering assets.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  The disbarment and findings of dishonesty significantly impact Atty. Limon's reputation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Prohibits unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 16, Rule 16.01:** Requires lawyers to account for client funds.
*   *Villanueva vs. Atty. Teresita Sta. Ana*, 245 SCRA 707 (1995):  Reiterates the requirement of good moral character for lawyers.
*   *Mayer vs. State Bar*, 2 Call2d 71, 39 P2d 206 (1934): Emphasizes the profession of law as public service and a means to secure justice.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not explicitly ambiguous, Atty. Limon's shifting explanations for the purpose of the funds (first as supersedeas bond money, then as attorney's fees) highlight a contentious issue he attempted to exploit. The Court clearly rejected his self-serving account.

**Overall:** This case represents a severe breach of professional ethics, resulting in disbarment due to the attorney's deceitful conduct and misappropriation of client funds. The ruling underscores the importance of honesty and integrity within the legal profession.
