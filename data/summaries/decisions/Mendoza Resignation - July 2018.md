Okay, here's a summary of the legal document in markdown format for a lawyer:

**A.M. No. 17-07-05-SC & A.M. No. 18-02-13-SC (Re: Atty. Brenda Jay Angeles Mendoza Appointment; Power of Court En Banc to Appoint Personnel)**

**Summary:**

This Resolution addresses a dispute within the Supreme Court regarding the scope of the Court En Banc's power to appoint officials and employees of the judiciary, specifically concerning the appointment of Atty. Brenda Jay Angeles Mendoza as Chief of Office for the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC) of the Philippine Judicial Academy (PHILJA).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Constitutional Mandate (Art. VIII, Sec. 5(6)):** The Constitution vests in the Supreme Court the power to appoint all officials and employees of the Judiciary. The core dispute is whether this power *must* be exercised solely by the En Banc, or can be delegated.
*   **Delegation via A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised):** This Administrative Matter delegated authority to the Chief Justice and Chairpersons of the Divisions to act on administrative matters, including the "appointment…of regular (including coterminous), temporary, casual, or contractual personnel" in various judicial bodies, including PHILJA.
*   **Dispute over Definition of "Personnel":** Associate Justice Leonardo-De Castro argues that "personnel" shouldn't include high-ranking officials or policy-determining third-level positions (Salary Grade 26 and higher, per A.M. No. 05-9-29-SC). She argues these positions should require En Banc approval. She cites *Manalang v. Quitoriano* (94 Phil. 903) for a restrictive interpretation of "personnel," excluding managers/heads.
*   **Chief Justice Sereno's Position:** Argued that the delegation in A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised) *does* include third-level positions and the distinction is unjustified. The aim was to relieve the En Banc of administrative burdens. She cites the Supreme Court Human Resource Manual (A.M. No. 00-6-1-SC), which provides that the selection of appointees to third-level positions classified as highly technical and/or policy determining pursuant to A.M. No. 05-9-29-SC shall be made by the Chief Justice with the concurrence of the Chairpersons of the Divisions pursuant to A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC. Also cited Administrative Circular No. 37-2001A.
*   **Atty. Mendoza's Appointment:** Atty. Mendoza was appointed by Chief Justice Sereno with the concurrence of the Chairpersons of the Divisions, following a recommendation from PHILJA Chancellor Azcuna (based on a screening panel). This contrasts with previous appointments to the same position that were made by the En Banc upon the recommendation of PHILJA's Board of Trustees (BOT).
*   **Administrative Order No. 33-2008:** This order governs the Philippine Mediation Center Office and states that the PHILJA Chief of Office for PMC "shall be appointed by the Court, upon recommendation of PHILJA."  The debate centers on whether "recommendation of PHILJA" *requires* a resolution from the PHILJA Board of Trustees.
*   **Procedural Issues & Inconsistencies:** The resolution highlights inconsistencies in past appointments to the PHILJA Chief of Office for PMC position, regarding whether a Board of Trustees resolution was required, and the level of the Court that made the appointment.
* **Status Quo Argument:** Maintaining that the existing rules and procedures for the appointment of personnel should be followed and implemented.
*   **Impact of A.M. No. 05-9-29-SC:** Classification as technical/policy-determining shields judiciary from civil service eligibility requirements for executive/managerial posts. This is relevant to the extent the civil service rules apply to the judiciary.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Risk of Invalid Appointments:** An overly broad interpretation of delegated authority could lead to questions about the validity of numerous appointments made by the Chief Justice/Division Chairs.
*   **Disruption of Judicial Operations:** Uncertainty regarding the proper appointment process could impede the filling of key positions, potentially harming the efficient functioning of the courts.
*   **Erosion of En Banc Authority:** An overly broad interpretation of delegation could be viewed as an abdication of the En Banc's constitutional responsibility for appointing judicial personnel.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Interpretation of "Personnel" in A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised):** This is the central point of contention. What level of employee is encompassed? *Manalang* arguably limits its scope to subordinate employees, but its applicability in this context is debated.
*   **Meaning of "Recommendation of PHILJA" in Administrative Order No. 33-2008:** Does it require a formal resolution from the PHILJA Board of Trustees or is a recommendation from the PHILJA Chancellor sufficient? The Resolution highlights prior inconsistent practice.
*   **The applicability of the Supreme Court Human Resource Manual:** The appointment of the Chief of Office of the PMCO has not been consistent.

**Outcome/Resolution:**

*   Atty. Mendoza's resignation was accepted, rendering the specific issue of her appointment moot.
*   The Court *clarified* that the delegation of appointing power in A.M. No. 99-12-08-SC (Revised) *does not* extend to personnel with salary grades 29 and higher, and those with judicial rank. These positions require En Banc appointment. The official who is the next most senior in rank shall be the officer-in­-charge of the Philippine Mediation Center Office until the appointment of the new PHILJA Chief of Office of the Philippine Mediation Center.
*   The PHILJA Board of Trustees was instructed to commence with its selection process for its recommendations to the position of the PHILJA Chief of Office of the Philippine Mediation Center.
*   In the separate opinion, the interpretation or clarification of the above-mentioned rules and issuances should be applied prospectively to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances.
*   The ponencia sought to resolve pending questions as to the interpretation of this Court's power as contained in the Constitution, relevant laws, and this Court's administrative orders.

**Need for Further Action:**

*   The Court needs to develop clear and consistent guidelines for the appointment of all court officials and employees, especially those in third-level positions. This should involve amending the Supreme Court Merit Selection and Promotion Plan and submitting it to the Civil Service Commission for approval.
