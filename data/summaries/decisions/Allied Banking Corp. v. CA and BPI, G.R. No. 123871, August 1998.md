## Legal Document Summary: Allied Banking Corporation vs. Court of Appeals and Bank of the Philippine Islands (G.R. No. 123871)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a third-party complaint filed by Allied Banking Corporation (Allied) against Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) as successor-in-interest of Commercial Bank and Trust Company (COMTRUST) related to checks originally issued by Hyatt Terraces Baguio in favor of Meszellen Commodities Services, Inc. The checks were deposited with COMTRUST, cleared through the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC), and paid by Allied. When Meszellen sued Allied for improper payment, Allied filed a third-party complaint against BPI for reimbursement based on COMTRUST's warranty on endorsements. The trial court dismissed the third-party complaint, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PCHC Membership & Arbitration:** Both Allied and BPI are members of the PCHC and therefore bound by its Clearing House Rules and Regulations, specifically Section 38 regarding arbitration of disputes involving cleared checks. The Court refers to Section 3 and 36.6 of the PCHC-CHRR, as well as Section 2 of the Arbitration Law
*   **COMTRUST's Warranty:** COMTRUST, as the collecting bank, provided a warranty of "All prior endorsements and/or lack of endorsements guaranteed" stamped on the back of the checks.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Allied's Potential Liability to Meszellen:** Allied faces potential liability to Meszellen for damages resulting from the improper payment of the checks.
*   **BPI's (as COMTRUST's successor) Potential Liability to Allied:** BPI, potentially liable to Allied based on COMTRUST's warranty, may be obligated to reimburse Allied if Allied is found liable to Meszellen.
*   **Risk of Dismissal due to Premature Filing:** Allied risked dismissal of its third-party complaint due to its failure to exhaust the PCHC's arbitration process before resorting to judicial action.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Arbitration Law (RA 876):** Referenced in the context of the PCHC's arbitration agreement, highlighting that participation in clearing operations constitutes written consent to binding arbitration (Sections 2 and 4 of RA 876)
*   **Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Equitable Banking Corporation (157 SCRA 188):** Established the principle that participation in PCHC clearing operations signifies submission to its jurisdiction and arbitration rules.
*   **Associated Bank v. Court of Appeals (233 SCRA 137):** Reaffirmed the mandatory recourse to PCHC arbitration for disputes concerning cleared checks and disallowed a similar third-party complaint filed prematurely.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The timing of accrual of the cause of action for prescription purposes could be considered ambiguous. The Court of Appeals ruled that the cause of action accrued when Allied paid the checks, triggering the prescription period. Allied argued it only accrued upon filing of the suit by Meszellen. The Supreme Court did not weigh in on this issue in detail.

**Potential Risks & Recommendations:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The primary risk is the dismissal of the third-party complaint for lack of jurisdiction because Allied failed to exhaust remedies with the PCHC.
*   **Procedural Deficiency:** The third-party complaint was dismissed because the claim should have first been submitted to the PCHC Arbitration Committee, making the filing premature.
*   **Recommendation:** Pursue arbitration with the PCHC Arbitration Committee to obtain a ruling on the dispute before potentially re-filing in court if necessary on questions of law.
