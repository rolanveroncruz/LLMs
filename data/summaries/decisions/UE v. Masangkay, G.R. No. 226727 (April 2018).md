## Legal Document Summary: *University of the East v. Masangkay and Regondola*, G.R. No. 226727

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of CA decision reinstating Labor Arbiter's ruling of illegal dismissal.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** University of the East (UE) and Dr. Ester Garcia
*   **Respondents:** Veronica M. Masangkay and Gertrudo R. Regondola

**Key Provisions & Facts:**
*   Respondents, Associate Professors and Deans at UE, were dismissed for plagiarism after submitting manuals with certifications of originality.
*   UE received complaints from authors Harry Chenoweth and Lucy Block alleging plagiarism of their works ("Applied Engineering Mechanics," "Engineering Mechanics," and "Engineering Mechanics: Statics & Dynamics").
*   UE investigated and dismissed the respondents.
*   Respondents collected accrued benefits post-dismissal after signing vouchers and pay slips.
*   Rocamora, co-author, successfully challenged her dismissal in *University of the East and Dr. Ester Garcia v. Adelia Rocamora*, G.R. No. 199959.
*   Respondents filed an illegal dismissal case almost three years after dismissal, citing Rocamora's victory.

**Ruling History:**
*   **Labor Arbiter:** Ruled in favor of respondents, finding illegal dismissal and ordering reinstatement with backwages (â‚±4,623,873.34 total).
*   **NLRC:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter, dismissing the complaint.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision, citing *stare decisis* based on the Rocamora case.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**
*   **Granted** the Petition for Review. Reversed the CA decision and dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Stare Decisis Inapplicable:** The Rocamora case is not a binding precedent because the respondents were not similarly situated. Masangkay and Regondola, unlike Rocamora, certified under oath the originality of the manuals.
    *   **Plagiarism Established:** The Court reviewed the evidence and found sufficient evidence of plagiarism, specifically the verbatim copying of significant portions of Chenoweth and Singer's books without attribution.
    *   **Waiver of Rights:** Respondents' acceptance of benefits post-termination, coupled with Masangkay's request to apply benefits towards a car loan, demonstrated a voluntary acceptance of the dismissal and a waiver of the right to contest it.

**Key Legal Issues & Potential Risks:**
*   **Misconduct as Just Cause for Dismissal:** The core issue is whether plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty, constitutes serious misconduct justifying dismissal under the Labor Code.
*   **Application of *Stare Decisis*:** The SC found that the CA erred in applying *stare decisis* due to differing factual circumstances.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The CA erred in applying strict rules of evidence and disregarding UE's proof of plagiarism. The SC emphasized the relaxed rules of evidence in labor cases.
*   **Waiver and Quitclaims:** The SC considered whether the respondents' acceptance of benefits constituted a valid waiver of their right to challenge the dismissal. The danger here is whether the waiver was obtained with coercion or lack of understanding on the part of the respondents.
*   **Moral Damages:** The SC deemed the awards by the Labor Arbiter unwarranted due to the finding of a valid dismissal.

**Statutory References:**
*   Labor Code (impliedly, on just cause for dismissal)
*   Intellectual Property Code (regarding attribution of sources, Section 184)
*   Civil Code, Article 6 (regarding waiver of rights)

**Potential Risks for UE:**
*   While the SC ruled in favor of UE in this instance, future similar cases could hinge on the specific facts and evidence presented. Careful documentation of plagiarism and adherence to due process is crucial. Future cases could turn on establishing proper investigation and documentation for future dismissals of employees.
