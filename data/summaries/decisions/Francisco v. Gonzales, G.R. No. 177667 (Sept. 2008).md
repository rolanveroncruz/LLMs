## Legal Document Summary: Francisco v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 177667 (2008)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reviewing a CA decision affirming RTC orders that denied a motion to stop an execution sale.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of levying and selling a property registered in the name of "Cleodualdo M. Francisco, married to Michele U. Francisco" to satisfy a judgment debt against Michele and George Zoltan Matrai arising from an unlawful detainer case.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, nullifying the CA and RTC decisions. The property could not be levied and sold to satisfy Michele's debt because the debt:

*   Was not proven to have benefited the conjugal partnership of Cleodualdo and Michele (governed by the Civil Code on conjugal partnership of gains, given their marriage date).
*   Michele and Matrai purported to be husband and wife at the time of the lease.
*   There was already an annotation on the title related to the nullification of the marriage and the impending transfer of ownership to their children.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** Partial Decision in a nullity of marriage case (Civil Case No. 93-2289) stipulated that Cleodualdo and Michele would transfer ownership of the conjugal property to their children, Cleodia and Ceamantha, via donation when they reached 19 and 18 years old, respectively, with Cleodualdo retaining usufructuary rights until age 65.
*   **Unlawful Detainer Case:** Decision against Michele and Matrai ordering them to vacate leased premises and pay back rentals, unpaid telephone bills, and attorney's fees. This is the source of the judgment debt being executed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Michele and Matrai:** Primarily liable for the judgment debt in the unlawful detainer case.
*   **Spouses Jorge C. Gonzales and Purificacion W. Gonzales (Respondents):** Held liable for costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Ownership Transfer:** While the Compromise Agreement stipulated a future transfer, the RTC argued no effective transfer had occurred yet and bizarrely, even claimed Michele was the owner because of Cleodualdo's waiver. The Supreme Court correctly refutes this by stating that the agreement must be read in its entirety.
*   **Benefit to the Family:** Respondents argued the leased property benefited the family, but the Court found insufficient evidence to support this, especially given the separation of Cleodualdo and Michele, and that Michele and Matrai purported to be husband and wife.
*   **Usufructuary Rights:** Cleodualdo retains usufructuary rights until 65. This could become relevant if Cleodualdo attempts to sell, lease, or otherwise alienate the property beyond his usufructuary rights.
*   **Lack of Deed of Donation:** The absence of a formal Deed of Donation conveying the property to the children could pose future problems in perfecting ownership.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code provisions on Conjugal Partnership of Gains (Art. 161):** Crucial in determining whether the wife's (Michele's) debt benefitted the family. *BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals* is cited.
*   **Rules of Court on Execution:** Specifically, the power of the court to execute extends only to properties belonging to the judgment debtor and not exempt from execution.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Go v. Yamane, G.R. No. 160762, May 3, 2006, 489 SCRA 107, 124:**  Defines the limits of the court's power in executing judgments.
*   **Yao v. Perello, 460 Phil. 658, 662 (2003):**  Emphasizes the principle that one man's goods should not be sold for another man's debts.
*   **BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, No. L-61464, May 28, 1988, 161 SCRA 608:**  Addresses the issue of conjugal liability for debts contracted by one spouse, specifically requiring proof that the obligation redounded to the benefit of the conjugal partnership.
*   **Homeowners Savings and Loan Bank v. Dailo, G.R. No. 153802, March 11, 2005, 453 SCRA 283, 292:** Burden of proving the benefit to the family falls upon the one who asserts it.
*   **Luzon Surety Co., Inc. v. Garcia, 140 Phil. 509 (1969):** The Civil Code is concerned with the family as a unit.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court correctly reversed the lower courts, emphasizing that the property of the children cannot be used to satisfy the debts of their mother where the debt did not benefit the conjugal partnership. The annotation on the title provided constructive notice of the impending transfer. Further action must be taken to transfer ownership by the execution of a deed of donation by Cleodualdo and Michele.
