Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, focusing on key aspects relevant to a lawyer:

**Case:** *Bureau of Customs (BOC) v. Hon. Paulino Q. Gallegos, et al.* G.R. No. 220832, February 28, 2018 (826 Phil. 867).

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution on a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing an Omnibus Order of the RTC granting a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Bureau of Customs (BOC) and Department of Budget and Management-Procurement Service (DBM-PS).
*   **Respondents:** Judge Paulino Q. Gallegos (RTC Judge) and the Joint Venture of Omniprime Marketing, Inc. and Intrasoft International, Inc.

**Factual Background:**

*   The case involves the procurement process for Phase Two of the Philippines' National Single Window with Enhanced Customs Processing System project (PNSW 2), a crucial information technology project aimed at integrating electronic customs systems. (Public Bidding No. 14-082).
*   BOC, through DBM-PS, issued a Request for Expression of Interest (RFEI).
*   The Joint Venture of Omniprime and Intrasoft submitted a bid.
*   DBM-PS issued a Notice of Highest Rated Bid (HRB) and Invitation to Negotiate to the Joint Venture.
*   After Commissioner Lina's appointment as BOC Commissioner, he requested the discontinuance of the procurement, citing Section 41(c) of RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) - the right to reject bids if not beneficial to the government.
*   DBM-PS subsequently issued a Notice of Cancellation, aborting the bidding process.
*   The Joint Venture filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus in the RTC, seeking to annul the Notice of Cancellation and compel the continuation of the bidding process (contract signing and issuance of Notice to Proceed). The RTC issued a TRO and then the WPI.

**Key Provisions and Rulings:**

*   **RTC Ruling (Challenged):**  Granted the WPI, enjoining the BOC and DBM-PS from implementing the cancellation, initiating other procurement efforts, and ordering them to continue the remaining procurement process with the Joint Venture.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Dismissed the BOC and DBM-PS's Petition for Certiorari and affirmed the RTC's Omnibus Order granting the WPI.

**Key Legal Issues and Reasoning:**

1.  **Procedural Infirmities of the Petition:** The Court noted that the petitioners failed to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC ruling before filing the Petition for Certiorari, and that the direct resort to the Supreme Court was a disregard of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts.
2.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The core issue was whether the RTC Judge committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Omnibus Order and the WPI.  The Supreme Court found no such abuse.
3.  **Applicability of R.A. No. 8975:** The Court affirmed the RTC's determination that R.A. No. 8975 (prohibiting TROs/injunctions against government infrastructure projects) does *not* apply because the PNSW 2 procurement is considered a "consulting service contract" and not an infrastructure project within the meaning of the law. *DFA v. Falcon* was cited for distinguishing between civil works and non-civil works components of IT projects.
4.  **Requirements for Preliminary Injunction:** The Court reiterated the requirements for a WPI: (1) a right in esse or a clear and unmistakable right to be protected; (2) a violation of that right; and (3) an urgent and permanent act and urgent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage. *Medina v. Greenfield Dev't. Corp.* was cited. The Court held that the Joint Venture had met these requirements. As the highest bidder, the Joint Venture had a right to be awarded the contract. This right was violated by the Notice of Cancellation. The Court reasoned that the Commissioner Lina's cancellation letter and Director Syquia's Notice of Cancellation were without factual and legal bases because R.A. 9184 required "justifiable and reasonable ground" for rejecting bids.

**Specific Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):**  Section 41(c) (reservation clause), Section 38 (Period of action on procurement activities) and related IRR provisions.
*   **R.A. No. 8975:** The applicability to infrastructure projects only was a key issue.
*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 (BP 129):** Section 21 (original jurisdiction of RTCs).
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari.
*   **Rule 58 of the Rules of Court:** Preliminary Injunction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Justifiable and Reasonable Ground (RA 9184):** The application of Section 41(c) of RA 9184, regarding the right to reject bids, was at the heart of the dispute.  The Court scrutinized whether the stated reasons for cancellation met the "justifiable and reasonable ground" standard defined in the IRR, finding that they did not. Commissioner Lina's request "to conduct a thorough review of its details" does not qualify as "justifiable ground".

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Delay and/or Non-Implementation of the ASEAN Single Window (ASW) Protocol:**  The Court noted the potential impact on the Philippines' international commitments if the procurement was further delayed.
*   **Breach of Contract Damages:** If the procurement is further delayed or cancelled without proper justification, the government could be exposed to claims for damages from the Joint Venture.
*   **Future challenges to government procurements:** The ruling reinforces the need for strict adherence to procurement laws and regulations, particularly regarding the exercise of reservation clauses and the justification for rejecting bids.

**Next Steps:**

*   The case is remanded to the RTC for resolution of the main petition in Civil Case No. 15-134333.
*   The BOC and DBM-PS must comply with the WPI and continue the procurement process, unless they can demonstrate, during the full trial on the merits, a valid and justifiable reason for cancellation based on the criteria in RA 9184 and its IRR.
