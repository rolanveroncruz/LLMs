**Case Summary: K-Phil., Inc. vs. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company, G.R. No. 167500, October 17, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petitioners (K-Phil, Soo Myung Park, and Network Development Holding Corp) sought to reverse the CA decision which upheld the validity of an extrajudicial foreclosure initiated by Respondent Metrobank. The CA set aside the initial Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale due to inaccuracies and inadequacies.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Metrobank extended loans and credit accommodations to K-Phil, secured by a real estate mortgage over Network's property and a chattel mortgage over K-Phil's machinery. K-Phil's obligation to repay the loans per the loan agreement, secured by mortgages.
*   **Mortgage Agreement:** The Real Estate Mortgage contained provisions regarding the venue of the foreclosure sale. Stipulated the location of the auction sale in Imus, Cavite was inconsistent with the express stipulation of the real estate mortgage that the auction sale was to be held at the capital of the province, Trece Martires City, or in the city where the property is located, Dasmariñas, Cavite.
*   **Foreclosure Proceedings:** Metrobank initiated extrajudicial foreclosure due to alleged violations of the loan terms by K-Phil.
*   **Notice of Sale:** A new Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale correcting all the inaccuracies and inadequacies pointed out in the decision of the Court.
*   **Act 3135** Entitled "An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted in or Annexed to Real Estate Mortgages," as amended by Act 4118.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **K-Phil/Network's Liability:** Failure to fulfill the terms of the loan agreement resulted in foreclosure. Risk of losing mortgaged assets.
*   **Metrobank's Liability:** Potential liability for damages if the foreclosure process was conducted improperly.
*   **Risk of Invalidation:** Potential risk of invalidating the sale if the auction sale is conducted in an inconsistent location stipulated in the agreement.

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancy in Debt Amount:** The difference between the amount stated in the foreclosure petition and the actual outstanding debt.
*   **Venue of Sale:** The mortgage contract stipulated that the auction sale was to be held at the capital of the province, Trece Martires City, or in the city where the property is located, Dasmariñas, Cavite, not in Imus, Cavite.
*   **Parties in the Petition** Network's name was indeed omitted from the caption of the application/petition for extrajudicial foreclosure. However, this omission was not fatal to Metrobank's application as it was not in violation of Act 3135

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act 3135 (as amended by Act 4118):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Act No. 1508:** An Act Providing for the Mortgaging of Personal Property and for the Registration of the Mortgages so Executed
*   **Olizon v. CA, G.R. No.107075, 1 September 1994, 236 SCRA 148:** Emphasized strict compliance with statutory provisions for publication of notice.
*   **Suico v. Philippine National Bank, G.R. No. 170215, 28 August 2007, 531 SCRA 514, 523:** The statutory provisions governing publication of notice of mortgage foreclosure sales must be strictly complied with and that even slight deviations therefrom will invalidate the notice
*   **Republic v. Nolasco, G.R. No. 155108, 27 April 2005, 457 SCRA 400, 418:** It is the allegations in the body of the petition that control and not the heading or caption.

**Ambiguity:**

*   There may be a discrepancy in the amount of indebtedness stated in the notice and that actually owed by petitioners, such discrepancy tends to appreciate, rather than depreciate,[29] the value of the mortgaged properties. It cannot be reasonably considered to have prevented the estimation of a fair price.
*   The notice clearly identified Network as the mortgagor. Such identification in the notice of extrajudicial sale was what counted under the rules of procedure in extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, finding no merit in the claims. The CA's decision, ordering the issuance of a corrected notice of sale, was deemed sufficient to remedy the discrepancies. No damages were awarded to the petitioners.
