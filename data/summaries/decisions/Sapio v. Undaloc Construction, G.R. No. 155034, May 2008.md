**Legal Document Summary: Sapio v. Undaloc Construction (G.R. No. 155034)**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Virgilio Sapio (Employee)
*   **Respondents:** Undaloc Construction and/or Engr. Cirilo Undaloc (Employer)

**Key Issue:** Entitlement to salary differential and attorney's fees due to alleged underpayment of wages during employment. Project employee vs regular employee (resolved as project employee)

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

1.  **Employee Status:** Determined to be a *project employee*.

2.  **Salary Differential Claim:**
    *   Petitioner alleged underpayment based on Wage Order No. ROVII-03 et seq.
    *   The Labor Arbiter (LA) initially found in favor of the employee, but the Court of Appeals (CA) reversed this on the basis that the allegation of fraud in the payroll was not substantiated by sufficient evidence.
    *   SC Partially granted petition, finding petitioner entitled to a salary differential for specific periods (1/1/96-8/30/96 and 7/1/97-5/31/98) where actual wages were demonstrably below the minimum wage mandated by applicable Wage Orders.
    *   **Statutory Basis:** Wage Orders ROVII-01, ROVII-04, ROVII-05, ROVII-06, R.A. No. 6727 (as amended by R.A. No. 8188).

3.  **Payroll Sheets:**
    *   Employer submitted typewritten payroll sheets indicating higher wages.
    *   Employee presented a December 1995 payroll sheet written in pencil, arguing that it demonstrated a practice of altering payrolls.
    *   The LA's conclusion regarding the unreliability of the payroll due to pencil entries was rejected by the CA and SC.
    *   **Presumption:** Payroll entries are presumed regular (Rule 130, Section 43, Rules of Court). Burden of proof shifts to the employee to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence, in line with *Kar Asia, Inc. v. Corona.*

4.  **Wage Calculation:**
    *   The court recalculated the salary differential amount based on applicable Wage Orders, considering the employer's size and financial status to determine the correct wage category.

5.  **Double Indemnity:**
    *   Per Section 12 of R.A. No. 6727, as amended, employer ordered to pay double the unpaid benefits owing to the employees. Total differential awarded was 13,156.00 after doubling the original 6,578.00.

6.  **Attorney's Fees:**
    *   Awarded attorney's fees, capped at 10% of the total award as per Article 2208 of the Civil Code and Rule VIII, Sec. 8, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, in line with *Remigio v. NLRC*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** Obligated to pay salary differential of P13,156.00 plus 10% attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer liable for double indemnity for failure to pay prescribed minimum wage.
*   Employer potentially subject to criminal liability under R.A. 6727, Section 12 for Wage Order Violations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misclassification of Employee:** Risk of misclassifying employees, specifically, the implications of *project employee* vs. *regular employee* status and its effect on benefit entitlements.
*   **Wage Order Compliance:** Risk of non-compliance with minimum wage laws and wage orders, triggering double indemnity and potential criminal penalties.
*   **Payroll Record Keeping:** Inadequate or suspicious payroll practices can create an appearance of impropriety.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Deficiencies in the CA petition (lack of certified true copies) were waived due to the petitioner's failure to raise the issue earlier.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Wage Orders:** ROVII-01, ROVII-04, ROVII-05, ROVII-06
*   **R.A. No. 6727 (as amended by R.A. No. 8188):** Minimum Wage Law
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Basis for attorney's fees
*   **Rule VIII, Sec. 8, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code:** Cap on attorney's fees
*   **Rule 130, Section 43, Rules of Court:** Presumption of regularity of payroll entries
*   *G&M (Phils), Inc. v. Cruz* - Burden of proving payment of monetary claims.
*   *Kar Asia, Inc. v. Corona* - Employee's burden to prove fraud in the preparation of payrolls.
*   *Remigio v. National Labor Relations Commission* - Basis for Attorney's Fees.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolved around the credibility of payroll records and the alleged practice of maintaining dual payrolls. The allegation of fraud was based on circumstantial evidence (the use of pencil on one payroll) and was ultimately deemed insufficient.
