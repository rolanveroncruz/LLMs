## Legal Document Summary: *Bonaventure Mining Corporation vs. V.I.L. Mines, Incorporated*

**Case:** *Bonaventure Mining Corporation vs. V.I.L. Mines, Incorporated*, G.R. No. 174918, August 13, 2008 (584 Phil. 207)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that upheld VMI's EPA-IVA-63 and cancelled BMC's EPA-IVA-72. This is a conflict over overlapping mining claims in Quezon and Camarines Norte.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Dispute Origin:** Overlapping Exploration Permit Applications (EPA) between BMC and VMI, triggered by Greenwater Mining Corporation's failure to relinquish excess areas in its Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) application within the statutory deadline.
*   **RA 7942 & DAO 95-23/96-25/96-40:** This is an interpretation on the application of Republic Act No. 7942 (The Philippine Mining Act of 1995) and its implementing rules (DAO 95-23, as amended by DAO 96-25 and DAO 96-40), specifically regarding the maximum contract area for FTAAs and the deadline for relinquishing excess areas.
*   **DMO 97-07:** Critical interpretation of DENR Memorandum Order No. 97-07, which set a *mandatory deadline* of September 15, 1997, for relinquishing excess FTAA areas. The core issue is whether failure to meet this deadline resulted in automatic cancellation *ipso facto,* or required further DENR action.
*   **Timeliness of Petition:** The Court ruled that the filing was out of time, service should be made on the counsel, the address of record was not properly updated.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **FTAA Applicants (Greenwater):** Obligated to relinquish areas exceeding the maximum contract area within the prescribed deadline (September 15, 1997, under DMO 97-07). Failure results in denial or cancellation of the FTAA application.
*   **Miners/Applicants (BMC & VMI):** Compliance with mining laws and regulations, including prioritization based on the validity and timeliness of applications.
*   **Counsel (Atty. Peñarroyo):** Obligated to maintain an accurate address of record with the court. Failure to update address binds the client.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Ipso Facto" Cancellation:** The CA interpreted DMO 97-07 as causing automatic cancellation of Greenwater's FTAA application upon failure to meet the deadline. This is contentious because BMC argues executive action is required to open the areas to new mining applications.
*   **OIC-RD's Letter of October 22, 1997:** This letter extends the deadline for Greenwater to submit technical descriptions. The CA deems it invalid because it contradicts DMO 97-07's non-extension clause (Section 14).
*   **Address of Record Inconsistencies:** Discrepancy between the counsel's actual address and the address of record used in court filings. The court sided with the address on the records and therefore considered the filing out of time.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7942 (The Philippine Mining Act of 1995):**  Specifically, Section 34 on maximum contract area limits.
*   **DAO 95-23, DAO 96-25, DAO 96-40:** Implementing rules and regulations of RA 7942, particularly provisions regarding the deadline for relinquishing excess FTAA areas.
*   **DMO 97-07:**  "Guidelines in the Implementation of the Mandatory September 15, 1997 Deadline…" - The most crucial legal reference.  Sections 12 (Divestment/Relinquishment of Areas) and 14 (No Extension of Periods) are central to the court's interpretation.
*   ***Karen and Kristy Fishing Industry v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 172760-61, October 15, 2007, 536 SCRA 243, 250. Cubar, et al. v. Hon. Mendoza, etc., et al., 205 Phil. 672, 676 (1983).***

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, prioritizing VMI's mining application. The key issue was Greenwater's failure to comply with the mandatory deadline set by DMO 97-07. The court emphasized that DMO 97-07's deadlines are strict, and no extensions are permissible. BMC was bound by their counsel's negligence in failing to update the address of record, making the filing late. The court ruled failure to comply with the requirements within the deadline set by DMO 97-07 resulted in automatic cancellation *ipso facto.*
