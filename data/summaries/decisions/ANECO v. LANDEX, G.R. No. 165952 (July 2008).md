**Legal Document Summary: _Aneco Realty and Development Corporation vs. Landex Development Corporation, G.R. No. 165952, July 28, 2008_**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision affirming the RTC Order dismissing Aneco's complaint for injunction against Landex.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Ownership:** Fernandez Hermanos Development, Inc. (FHDI) originally owned the land, subdivided it, and sold 22 lots to Aneco and 17 to Landex.
*   **Dispute:** Landex began constructing a concrete wall on its property. Aneco sought an injunction to restrain construction, claiming it blocked their access.
*   **FHDI's Intent:** FHDI expressly stated in the deed of sale to Aneco that it was no longer pursuing its subdivision project.
*   **Access:** Landex argued Aneco had access to their lots via other streets (Miller, Resthaven, San Francisco del Monte St.) , rendering their properties not isolated.
*   **RTC Initial Ruling:** Initially granted injunction in favor of Aneco, ordering Landex to stop construction/remove wall.
*   **RTC Reconsideration:** RTC granted Landex's motion for reconsideration, dismissing Aneco's complaint, on the grounds that the property was no longer part of a subdivision and Aneco has an ingress and egress to their property. Cited Art. 430 of the Civil Code regarding an owner's right to fence their property.
*   **CA Affirmance:** CA affirmed the RTC's dismissal, finding that Aneco was aware the lots were not subdivision units and failed to establish the requisites for a compulsory easement of right of way under _Cristobal v. CA, 291 SCRA 122_. Cited Art. 624 of the New Civil Code.

**Obligations:**

*   **Landex:** While initially ordered to cease construction, their obligation to remove the wall was negated by the RTC's reconsideration, which was upheld. No clear legal obligation to refrain from fencing their property.
*   **Aneco:** No explicit legal obligation is imposed. However, their claim to a right of way was rejected. Obligation to respect Landex's property rights.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of Aneco:** If the injunction had been upheld, Aneco may be liable for wrongful injunction if its claims were ultimately proven unfounded.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defective Motion for Reconsideration:** Landex's motion for reconsideration lacked a notice of hearing, violating Sec. 5, Rule 15, Rules of Civil Procedure. This raised a procedural challenge, but the courts exercised discretion to relax this rule.
*   **Easement Rights:** Aneco's claim to an easement was contentious. The CA ruled they failed to meet the requirements for a compulsory easement of right of way.
*   **FHDI's Intent/Notice:** The crux of the dispute revolves around whether Aneco had sufficient notice that the "road lot" was no longer intended as such. The clause in the deed indicating FHDI's abandonment of the subdivision project proved crucial.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 430 of the Civil Code:** Right of owner to enclose property.
*   **Article 624 of the New Civil Code:** Easement between two estates.
*   **Section 5, Rule 15 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Notice of hearing requirements for motions.
*   **Section 6, Rule 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Liberal construction of rules.
*   **Cristobal v. CA, 291 SCRA 122:** Essential requisites for compulsory easement of right of way.
*   **Barnes v. Padilla, G.R. No. 160753, June 28, 2005, 461 SCRA 533:** Liberal application of procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice.
*   **E L Mercantile, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. L-70262, June 25, 1986, 142 SCRA 385:** Procedural due process and opportunity to be heard.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Aneco's petition, upholding Landex's right to fence its property. The key legal issues involved the application of procedural rules (notice of hearing) and the establishment of an easement right of way. The courts favored a liberal construction of the rules and found that Aneco failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to prevent Landex from fencing its land, particularly given FHDI's express intent to abandon the subdivision project when selling to Aneco.
