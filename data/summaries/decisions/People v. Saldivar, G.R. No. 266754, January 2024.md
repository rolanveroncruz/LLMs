**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Marivic Saldivar y Regatcho*, G.R. No. 266754 (January 29, 2024)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Marivic Saldivar for qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9208, as amended by RA No. 10364 (now RA No. 11862).  Saldivar was found guilty of recruiting and harboring a 14-year-old minor (AAA266754) for the purpose of prostitution.

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **RA 9208 Section 4(a) & 6(a):** Defines trafficking in persons as recruiting, transporting, harboring, or receiving a person for the purpose of prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, etc.  It is considered qualified trafficking when the trafficked person is a child.
*   **Elements of Trafficking (as per *People v. Casio*, 749 Phil. 458 (2014)):**
    1.  Act of recruiting, transporting, harboring, or receiving persons.
    2.  Means used (threat, force, coercion, fraud, deception, abuse of power/position, taking advantage of vulnerability, or giving/receiving payments).
    3.  Purpose of exploitation (prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, etc.).
*   All three elements were deemed present. The court highlighted the victim's testimony, and Saldivar's own admissions to pointing the victim to men seeking sexual partners.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00.
*   **Civil Liability:** PHP 500,000.00 in moral damages to the victim, AAA266754, with interest at 6% per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Minor Inconsistencies:** Saldivar argued inconsistencies in the victim's testimony (e.g., location of the prostitution). The Court dismissed these as minor inconsistencies that did not impact the credibility of the victim's central claims.
*   **Lack of Entrapment Operation:** Saldivar argued that the absence of an entrapment operation weakened the prosecution's case. The Court held that while entrapment operations are often used in human trafficking cases, they are not indispensable for a conviction (*Brozoto v. People*, G.R. No. 233420, April 28, 2021).  The victim's testimony was sufficient.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Saldivar alleged bias/motive on the part of the social workers involved.  The Court gave deference to the RTC's assessment of witness credibility, noting that the victim testified in a straightforward manner and that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness demeanor.
*   **Saldivar's Admission:** Her admission to directing men to the victim and awareness of the purpose undermines her defense of denial.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9208 (as amended by RA 10364 & RA 11862):**  Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act.
*   ***People v. Casio***, 749 Phil. 458 (2014): Defines the elements of trafficking in persons.
*   ***Brozoto v. People***, G.R. No. 233420, April 28, 2021:  Confirms that a conviction for trafficking can be based on the sole testimony of the victim.
*   ***People v. Alberio***, 477 Phil. 556 (2004): Established that victims of sexual abuse are not expected to perfectly recall all details.
*   General rule on deference to trial court's assessment of witness credibility (e.g. *People v. Talmesa*, 890 Phil. 273, 281 (2020)).

**Conclusion:**

The case is a straightforward application of RA 9208, as amended.  The Supreme Court relied heavily on the victim's testimony and the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. The absence of an entrapment operation and minor inconsistencies in the victim's testimony were deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction. The ruling highlights the vulnerability of minors and the state's commitment to protect them from exploitation.
