**Case Summary: Valenzuela v. People, G.R. No. 149988, August 14, 2009**

**Facts:** Ramie Valenzuela was charged with frustrated murder (later modified to attempted murder by the CA) for allegedly holding the victim, Gregorio Cruz, while his brother, Hermie Valenzuela, stabbed Cruz. The RTC convicted Valenzuela of frustrated murder, finding abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance. The CA affirmed with modification, convicting Valenzuela of attempted murder because the wounds were not fatal. The Supreme Court (SC) reviewed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Initially frustrated murder, later modified to attempted murder.
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC *granted* the petition, finding Valenzuela guilty of *attempted homicide* instead of attempted murder.
*   **Reasoning:** The SC overturned the lower courts' finding of *abuse of superior strength* as a qualifying circumstance to elevate the crime to murder.

**Obligations:**

*   Valenzuela is now obligated to serve a sentence for attempted homicide.

**Liabilities:**

*   Valenzuela is liable to serve an indeterminate sentence of four (4) months of *arresto mayor* in its medium period, as minimum, to three (3) years of *prision correccional* in its medium period, as maximum, for attempted homicide.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **None Identified:** Based on the information provided, there are no further potential risks. Valenzuela's conviction has been reduced, and the legal process seems to be concluded.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**  The crimes of frustrated murder, attempted murder, and attempted homicide fall under this code.
*   **RPC Art. 249 (Homicide):** Base charge that was being considered for the reduction of crime.
*   **RPC Art. 6 (Attempted Crimes):** Specifies the penalties associated with attempted crimes.
*   **People v. Aquino, G.R. Nos. 144340-42, August 6, 2002, 386 SCRA 391:**  Cited regarding the specificity required in alleging qualifying circumstances in the Information. The SC clarified that explicitly stating "aggravating/qualifying" isn't essential if the circumstances are detailed.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Used to determine the indeterminate sentence for attempted homicide.
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence on Abuse of Superior Strength:** The SC relied on a series of cases such as *People v. Daquipil*, *People v. Casingal*, *People v. Escoto*, and *People v. Ventura*  to define and determine the presence of abuse of superior strength.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** The central issue was whether the act of holding the victim while another stabbed him constituted abuse of superior strength. The SC found the evidence insufficient to prove that the assailants consciously sought to use their strength to overwhelm the victim.  Mere numbers or the presence of a weapon, without proof of deliberate intent to exploit a significant disparity in force, are insufficient. The victim's ability to retaliate also weakened the claim of abuse of superior strength.
*   **Intent to Kill:** The SC found that the intent to kill existed and was proven based on the location of the two stab wounds.
