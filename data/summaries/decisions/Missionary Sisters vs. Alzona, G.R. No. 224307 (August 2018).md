**Subject Matter:** Validity of a Deed of Donation Inter Vivos.

**Facts:**

*   Purificacion Alzona (Purificacion) executed a Deed of Donation Inter Vivos in favor of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Fatima (Petitioner), an entity not yet registered with the SEC at the time of donation. The donation involved parcels of land.
*   The Register of Deeds denied registration due to an adverse claim filed by Purificacion's brother, Amando Alzona (Amando).
*   Amando filed suit to annul the Deed, alleging the Petitioner lacked juridical personality at the time of the donation.
*   RTC dismissed the complaint, holding the Petitioner was a de facto corporation and the donation valid.
*   The CA reversed, declaring the Deed void, finding that the Petitioner was not a de facto corporation as there was no bona fide attempt to incorporate.
* Purificacion had expressed intent to donate the land via handwritten letter predating the Deed.
* The Petitioner was granted tax exemption by the BIR.
* The donation was made in consideration of love and affection, and past services rendered to Purificacion during her illness by the Petitioner.

*   **Acceptance of Donation:** Acceptance by Mother Concepcion, the Petitioner's Superior General.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents (Heirs of Amando):** Potential liability to uphold the Deed and transfer ownership to the Petitioner. Risk of losing the properties.
*   **Petitioner:** Risk that Deed could be declared invalid due to lack of juridical personality at the time of donation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Legal Capacity:** Was the Petitioner legally capable of accepting the donation at the time of execution?
*   **Mother Concepcion's Authority:** Did Mother Concepcion have the authority to accept the donation on behalf of the Petitioner? The Court ruled she did as Superior General of the Petitioner.
*   **De Facto Corporation vs. Corporation by Estoppel:** The Court rejects the de facto corporation argument of the RTC, favoring the application of corporation by estoppel.
*   **Ratification:** The court invoked ratification by conduct by Purificacion.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, **REVERSING** the CA decision and **UPHOLDING** the validity of the Deed of Donation.
*   The Court applied the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. The court holds the validity of the donation as it was executed for past services and it was intended to be given.
*   The Court emphasized the importance of upholding charitable intent and the equities of the situation.

**Potential Arguments & Considerations:**

*   The Court emphasized that the Respondents are bound by the Deed, as they are successors-in-interest to Purificacion.
*   Consider arguing promissory estoppel based on detrimental reliance. The Petitioner provided services in reliance on the promised donation.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court found in favor of the Petitioner, validating the Deed of Donation Inter Vivos. This case serves as a reminder of the court's inclination to consider and protect charity and philanthropic works.
