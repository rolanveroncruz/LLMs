**Case Summary: San Juan Structural and Steel Fabricators, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, Motorich Sales Corporation, et al. (G.R. No. 129459, September 29, 1998)**

**Core Issue:** Validity of a land sale agreement entered into by a corporate treasurer without express board authorization and potential piercing of the corporate veil.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agreement Dated February 14, 1989:** Purported sale of land owned by Motorich Sales Corporation to San Juan Structural, signed by Nenita Lee Gruenberg (Treasurer of Motorich) and Andres T. Co (President of San Juan). Price set at P5,200 per square meter with a down payment of P100,000.
*   **Obligation to Execute Transfer of Rights/Deed of Assignment:** Stipulated upon full payment, Motorich (Transferor) would execute a transfer of rights to San Juan (Transferee).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of Contract:** The central dispute revolves around whether Nenita Lee Gruenberg, as treasurer, had the authority to bind Motorich to the sale. Section 23 of the Corporation Code (BP 68) vests corporate powers in the Board of Directors. Without board authorization or ratification, the contract is potentially unenforceable against Motorich.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* The decision heavily relies on principles of agency, referencing *Yao Ka Sin Trading v. Court of Appeals* and *BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, emphasizing the duty of third parties to ascertain the agent's authority. Also highlights Article 1874 & 1878 of the Civil Code which requires special power of attorney for the sale of land.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** San Juan argues Motorich is a close corporation solely owned by the Gruenbergs, thus Nenita could act without board approval.  However, the court determines Motorich is not a close corporation based on Section 96 of the Corporation Code, which requires specific restrictions in the Articles of Incorporation (number of shareholders, transfer restrictions, listing on a stock exchange).
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* Decision references *Manuel R. Dulay Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, distinguishing it by noting board director knowledge and acquiescence of the sale. Decision cites Santos v. National Labor Relations Commission, 254 SCRA 673, March 13, 1996, per Vitug, J.; citing Sunio v. National Labor Relations Commission, 127 SCRA 390, 397-398, January 31, 1984 which states that "[m]ere ownership by a single stockholder or by another corporation of all or nearly all of the capital stock of a corporation is not of itself sufficient ground for disregarding the separate corporate personalities."
*   **Damages and Attorney's Fees:** San Juan seeks damages for bad faith, arguing Gruenberg misrepresented her authority.  The court denies this, finding no evidence of misrepresentation and noting San Juan's President, Co, should have verified Gruenberg's authority.
*   **Liability to Return Down Payment:** Despite the invalid contract, Nenita Gruenberg is ordered to return the P100,000 down payment based on unjust enrichment (Article 2154 of the Civil Code).
*   **TSN Alteration Argument:** The supposed alteration in the transcript where Gruenberg initially said "Yes, sir" when asked if she had misrepresented herself to be authorized by the corporation to sell the property is not enough to prove she had authority.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Gruenberg's Authority:** The agreement states Gruenberg is signing as "Treasurer" but doesn't explicitly define her authority to sell.  This is the central ambiguity exploited by Motorich.
*   **"Acceptance of Benefits":** San Juan argues Motorich ratified the contract through acceptance of benefits (the down payment).  However, the evidence only shows Gruenberg received the money, not necessarily the corporation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **BP 68 (Corporation Code of the Philippines):** Section 23 (powers of the Board), Section 40 (Sale or other disposition of assets), Section 96 (Definition of a Close Corporation)
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Articles 1318 (requisites of a valid contract), Article 1874 & 1878 (requiring a special power of attorney for sales of land), Article 2154 (unjust enrichment), and Article 2155 (payment by reason of a mistake in the construction or application of a difficult question of law).

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision: The contract is invalid due to lack of corporate authorization. The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is inapplicable. San Juan is not entitled to damages. Gruenberg must return the P100,000 down payment.
