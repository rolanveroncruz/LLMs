## Legal Document Summary: *Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Ombudsman Desierto et al.* (G.R. No. 136225)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus assailing the Ombudsman's Resolution dismissing the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans' (FFCBL) complaint for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) against private respondents (the Romualdezes) concerning a loan granted by DBP to Agretronics, Inc.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Behest Loan Allegations:** The FFCBL alleges the DBP loan to Agretronics exhibited characteristics of a "behest loan" as defined by Presidential Memorandum Order No. 61: undercollateralization, undercapitalization, extraordinary speed in loan approval, and connections between borrower officers and then-President Marcos (the Romualdezes are nephews of Imelda Marcos).
*   **Ombudsman's Resolution:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaint, finding (1) no probable cause and (2) prescription of the offense. The Ombudsman argued no evidence showed extraordinary speed in loan approval, the loan was not grossly disadvantageous to the government due to security measures, and the offense prescribed after 10 years from the date of the transaction (1980).
*   **FFCBL's Petition:** Argues the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in failing to find probable cause and in ruling the offense prescribed. FFCBL emphasizes its expertise in identifying behest loans and claims the Ombudsman disregarded key evidence suggesting such a loan.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted** the petition, reversed the Ombudsman's resolution, and ordered the Ombudsman to file the necessary information against the private respondents (Romualdezes) in the proper court.
*   The Court held the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion, emphasizing the preliminary investigation stage doesn't require a full display of evidence, only a well-grounded belief that an offense was committed. Matters of what constituted "extraordinary speed," and proper collaterals are better suited to the trail court.
*   The Court gave significant weight to the FFCBL's expertise in banking and loan transactions, composed of finance departments, and other prominent institutions.
*   Regarding prescription, the Court reiterated the doctrine from *Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto*, 375 Phil. 697 (1999), and *Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Ombudsman Desierto*, 415 Phil. 723 (2001): in cases of RA 3019 violations related to the Marcos era, the prescriptive period starts from the *discovery* of the offense, not the date of commission. The court deemed the discovery to be when the complaint was filed with the Ombudsman in 1996.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Romualdezes are potentially liable for violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019, if proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   The Ombudsman is obligated to file the necessary information based on the Court's finding of probable cause.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of "Behest Loan" Characteristics:** The prosecution will need to prove the DBP loan meets the criteria of a "behest loan" beyond a reasonable doubt, which can be difficult given the ambiguity in defining "undercollateralization," "undercapitalization," and "extraordinary speed".
*   **Elements of RA 3019:** The prosecution must prove all the elements of Section 3(e) or (g) of RA 3019, including "undue injury" to the government, or "manifestly and grossly disadvantageous" contract, and "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," or "gross inexcusable negligence" on the part of the public officers involved (not the Romualdezes).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e) and (g):** The core statutory basis for the allegations of corrupt practices.
*   **Presidential Memorandum Order No. 61:** Defines the characteristics of a behest loan, used by FFCBL in their investigation.
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto**, 375 Phil. 697 (1999) & 415 Phil. 723 (2001): Key precedents establishing the "discovery rule" for prescription in Marcos-era RA 3019 cases.
*   **People vs. Sandiganbayan, 211 SCRA 241 (1992):** Cites the computation of prescriptive period.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "crony" is vague and open to interpretation, and the Romualdezes contest that they are distant relatives of Imelda Marcos, not cronies.
*   The interpretation and application of the "discovery rule" for prescription can be contentious, particularly regarding what constitutes "discovery" and whether the government exercised due diligence.
