## Legal Document Summary: *Archipelago Management and Marketing Corporation vs. Court of Appeals and the Heirs of Rosalina Santos-Morales* (G.R. No. 128850)

**Nature:** Petition for Review seeking to set aside the CA's Amended Decision annulling a Deed of Absolute Sale due to fraud.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals committed a reversible error in ruling that the signature of Rosalina Santos-Morales on the Deed of Absolute Sale was fraudulently obtained.

**Facts:**

*   Rosalina Santos-Morales owned property (TCT No. 255716) as paraphernal property.
*   Rosalina, widowed, married Emeterio Morales, widower, father of Narciso Morales (president of Archipelago Management).
*   Emeterio allegedly took Rosalina's title, claiming it was for reconstitution after a fire.
*   A Deed of Absolute Sale (May 3, 1989) appeared, transferring the property to Archipelago for P1,200,000.00.
*   Rosalina continued to reside in the property, lease it out, and pay taxes.
*   Rosalina, through her daughter Lydia Trinidad, filed for annulment, alleging fraud, deceit, and lack of consideration.
*   Rosalina died, and her heirs (respondents) substituted as plaintiffs.
*   RTC initially dismissed the complaint; CA initially affirmed, later reversed on Motion for Reconsideration (MR).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Causal Fraud (Dolo Causante) Established:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's Amended Decision, finding that causal fraud vitiated Rosalina's consent.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Emeterio misrepresented the purpose of taking the title.
*   **Irregular Notarization:** Expired residence certificate used; notary was not commissioned. This is evidence of fraud as referenced in *Mariano v. Court of Appeals, 220 SCRA 716, 720 (1993)*.
*   **Acts of Ownership:** Rosalina continued acts of ownership (leasing, possession, tax payments, execution of holographic will) after the alleged sale.
*   **Immediate Disavowal:** Rosalina immediately denied signing the Deed of Absolute Sale and filed an affidavit to that effect.
*   **Lack of Consideration:** No conclusive proof Rosalina received the P1,200,000.00 consideration, which contradicted the burden of evidence as ruled in Section 3 (r), Rule 131, Rules of Court.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Archipelago):** Had the obligation to prove valid consent and consideration for the sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Archipelago):** Found liable for attempting to enforce a fraudulent contract.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Fraudulent Conveyance:** The Deed of Absolute Sale is voidable due to fraud, potentially subjecting Archipelago to further legal action related to clouding title/potential bad faith dealings.
*   **Damages:** While the original complaint sought damages, the Supreme Court's decision did not address this explicitly. A separate action for damages related to the fraudulent act may be viable, particularly in the form of actual and consequential damages related to the title being clouded.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1305, 1318, 1330, 1338 of the Civil Code:** Defines contracts, requisites, and vitiation of consent (fraud).
*   **Art. 428 of the Civil Code:** Defines ownership rights, highlighting *jus utendi* and *jus disponendi*.
*   **Songco v. Sellner, 37 Phil. 254 (1917):**  Distinguished based on the type of fraud and level of diligence required of the parties.
*   **Section 3 (r), Rule 131, Rules of Court:** Concerns legal presumptions.
*   **Mariano v. Court of Appeals, 220 SCRA 716, 720 (1993):** Deals with validity of public instruments challenged on fraud.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Paraphernal Property" vs. "Purchased with Emeterio's Money":**  While the title indicates paraphernal property and Emeterio even affirmed it to be true, Archipelago argued it was purchased with Emeterio's money, complicating the ownership and control claims. This was never fully litigated since the issue turned on the fraud claim.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the annulment of the Deed of Absolute Sale, emphasizing the existence of causal fraud in obtaining Rosalina's signature. The combination of misrepresentation, irregular notarization, continued acts of ownership by Rosalina, her immediate disavowal, and the dubious nature of the alleged consideration demonstrate the lack of valid consent, rendering the contract voidable.
