**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 07-09-13-SC (583 Phil. 391)**

**Case:** *In the Matter of the Allegations Contained in the Columns of Mr. Amado P. Macasaet...*

**Nature:** Indirect contempt of court proceedings against Amado P. Macasaet, publisher of Malaya, for articles alleging bribery within the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   Macasaet published articles (Sept 18-21, 2007) claiming a "lady justice" (later identified as Justice Ynares-Santiago) received a P10 million bribe delivered in milk boxes, discovered by her secretary, Cecilia Muñoz Delis.
*   Allegations include the lady justice's secretary being fired. The secretary's letter said she resigned from office and wasn't fired. As a matter of procedure, she would not have been tasked to receive boxes, as such was a duty assigned to their utility personnel; that it was "highly unlikely for something as blatant as [a] bribery attempt to have been done right in the doors of the Court."
*   The Chief Justice instructed ACA Marquez to have the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st September 2007 Business Circuit columns of respondent Macasaet included in the September 25, 2007 agenda of the Court En Banc.
*   Newsbreak also published a similar story, naming Justice Ynares-Santiago and Cecilia Delis.
*   In Resolution 25 September 2007, the SC ordered Macasaet to explain why he shouldn't be sanctioned for indirect contempt (Rule 71, Sec. 3(d) ROC).
*   An Investigating Committee was formed (retired Justices).

**Procedural Highlights:**

*   Macasaet invoked journalist's privilege (RA No. 53, as amended by RA No. 1477) to refuse revealing his source.
*   The Committee held hearings, gathered affidavits from Macasaet, Dañguilan-Vitug, Delis, and ACA Marquez to a preliminary meeting, in which they were requested to submit their respective affidavits which served as their testimonies on direct examination.
*   They were then later cross-examined on various dates: respondent Macasaet on January 10, 2008, Dañguilan-Vitug on January 17, 2008, Delis on January 24, 2008, and ACA Marquez on January 28, 2008.
*   The Investigating Committee submitted its Report and Recommendation on March 10, 2008, with the following findings of facts on the subject columns
*   Additional observations and conclusion were submitted.
*   In view of its tenuous underpinnings, we find the bribery story in Macasaet's columns of September 18-21, 2007, and in Ms. Vitug's Newsbreak issue of September 25, 2007, unbelievable.
*   Committee recommended Macasaet be held in indirect contempt (Rule 71, Sec. 3(d) ROC).
*   Macasaet asserted the subject matter of his articles is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. He cites Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution which partly states that "x x x members of the Supreme Court x x x may be removed from office, on impeachment for, and conviction of x x x bribery x x x" and Section 3(1), Article XI, which provides that "[t]he House of Representatives shall have the exclusive power to initiate all case of impeachment." We cannot agree.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Macasaet:** Duty to publish responsibly and accurately, avoiding baseless attacks on the judiciary.
*   **Court:** Balance press freedom and judicial independence.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Macasaet:** Potential for fines and/or imprisonment for indirect contempt.
*   **Potential Risk to Press Freedom:** Overly broad interpretation of contempt could chill legitimate criticism of the judiciary.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Section 3(d) & 7, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Basis for contempt charge and penalties.
*   **RA No. 53 (as amended by RA No. 1477):** Shield law for journalists (invoked, but ultimately irrelevant to the outcome).
*   **Cabansag v. Fernandez (102 Phil. 152):** Established theoretical formulas the "clear and present danger" rule and the "dangerous tendency" rule.
*   **In Re: Emil P. Jurado, (313 Phil. 119):** The Report implicitly used two parameters, first applied in In Re: Emil P. Jurado against which Macasaet's publications were measured: (1) whether Macasaet's story was false and (2) whether Macasaet could have prevented the publication of the false story by exercising diligence in verifying its veracity.
*   **New York Times v. Sullivan, (376 U.S. 254 [1964]):** Discussing the cases the majority cites, only three involved contempt by publication proceedings, two of which, In re Kelly and In re Sotto were decided long before we laid down the parameters of the clear and present danger test in Cabansag.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Improper conduct tending...to degrade the administration of justice" (Rule 71, Sec. 3(d)):** Subjective interpretation, potentially encompassing legitimate criticism.
*   **Defining the scope of journalist privilege:** Whether Macasaet's articles were a good faith attempt at investigative journalism or a reckless disregard for the truth.

**Outcome:**

The Court declared respondent Amado P. Macasaet GUILTY of indirect contempt of court and sentences him to pay a fine of P20,000.00, in accordance with Sections 3(d) and 7, Rule 71 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
