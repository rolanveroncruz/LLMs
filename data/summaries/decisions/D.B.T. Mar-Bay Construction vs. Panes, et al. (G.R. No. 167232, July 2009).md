**Case Summary: D.B.T. Mar-Bay Construction, Inc. vs. Ricaredo Panes, et al. (G.R. No. 167232, July 31, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Order, which dismissed the Complaint for Quieting of Title.

**Facts:**
*   **Subject Property:** A parcel of land in Brgy. Pasong Putik, Novaliches, Quezon City, covered by Lot Plan Psu-123169 (240,146 sqm).  Currently under TCT No. 200519 in the name of B.C. Regalado & Co., later conveyed to DBT through a *dacion en pago*.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Ricaredo Panes claims ownership and prior possession since 1936, asserting a right based on an approved plan (Psu-123169) and tax declarations. Allege overlap between their land and B.C. Regalado's subdivision plan, claiming fraud due to B.C. Regalado's use of derivative titles covering properties far from Pasong Putik. Filed a case (LRC Case No. Q-91-011) to perfect his title.
*   **Petitioner's Claim:** D.B.T. Mar-Bay Construction, Inc. (DBT) claims ownership via a *dacion en pago* from B.C. Regalado. Argues respondents are not real parties-in-interest and that their action affects its lot buyers.
*   **RTC's Initial Ruling:** Initially ruled in favor of the respondents, declaring TCT No. 200519 null and void insofar as it covers Lot Plan PSU-123169.
*   **RTC's Reversal:** On DBT's Motion for Reconsideration, the RTC reversed its prior decision, dismissing the complaint based on prescription and laches, as the land was registered.
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC's reversal, reinstating the original RTC decision favoring the respondents, stating that properties in TCT No. 200519 are located elsewhere, and considered that the RTC committed a procedural infraction when it entertained DBT's issues and evidence presented in its Motion for Reconsideration.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Quieting of Title:** Respondents filed the case as Quieting of Title.
*   **Prescription & Laches:** DBT raised prescription and laches in its Motion for Reconsideration. While normally such defense must be raised earlier, the RTC has the power to reverse its decisions based on error, particularly to prevent an injustice, and the Courts can dismiss actions on the ground of prescription or laches even if not pleaded, provided the facts demonstrating the same are apparent on record. The Court can decide the matter based on this, even if no statement is found in the pleadings. (Dino vs. Court of Appeals, 411 Phil. 594 (2001)).
*   **Imprescriptibility of Quieting of Title Action:** The Supreme Court affirmed that an action for quieting of title is imprescriptible if the plaintiff is in possession of the property. (Vda. de Gualberto v. Go, G.R. No. 139843, July 21, 2005, 463 SCRA 671, 681).
*   **Prescription and Reconveyance:** An action for reconveyance based on fraud prescribes in 4 years, while reconveyance based on an implied or constructive trust prescribes in 10 years. The discovery of fraud is deemed from the registration of the title.
*   **Torrens System:** Registered land under the Torrens system cannot be acquired by prescription or adverse possession (Article 1126, Civil Code; Section 46, Act No. 496).
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value:** DBT claims to be an innocent purchaser for value through *dacion en pago*, and the Supreme Court agreed that the evidence suggests that it is an innocent purchaser for value that is to be protected in the Torrens system.
*   **Dacion en Pago:** The delivery and transmission of ownership of a thing by the debtor to the creditor as an accepted equivalent of the performance of the obligation (Uy vs. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 111544, July 6, 2004, 433 SCRA 424, 438).
*   **Section 32 of P.D. No. 1529:** Review of decree of registration; Innocent purchaser for value.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **DBT:** Owes a duty to its lot buyers as a developer.
*   **B.C. Regalado:** Potential liability for fraud if proven it deliberately misrepresented the property's boundaries.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Fraud Allegations:** Though not proven, allegations of fraudulent titling by B.C. Regalado could lead to future litigation from other affected parties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Determining whether DBT had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged fraud and whether DBT had the qualifications of being an innocent purchaser for value and good faith.
*   Clarification of what constitutes good faith and the extent of due diligence required when acquiring property.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, **REVERSING** the CA decision and **DISMISSING** the respondents' Complaint. The Court held that while the action for quieting of title is imprescriptible due to respondents' possession, the land is registered under the Torrens system, and acquisitive prescription is unavailable against registered land. The Court also considered DBT as an innocent purchaser for value whose rights should be protected.
