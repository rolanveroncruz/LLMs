**Legal Document Summary: Golangco v. Fung, G.R. No. 157952 (2009)**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning a libel prosecution (Criminal Case No. 95-145703) initiated by Petitioner Golangco against Respondent Fung. The core issue is the propriety of the trial court's order declaring the Prosecution to have terminated the presentation of evidence due to their failure to present a witness (Atty. Ramos) despite multiple postponements and a prior "final" warning. The Court of Appeals (CA) upheld the trial court's order, and the Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation to Present Evidence Diligently:** The Prosecution, including the complainant, has a duty to ensure witness availability and present its case without undue delay. (Emphasis on proving the case *sans vexatious and oppressive delays.*)
*   **Requirement for Subpoenas:** While a party can request a subpoena, it is their responsibility to provide the court with the necessary information (date/time of appearance) and diligently follow up, specifically requesting new subpoena for a hearing even if a previous one wasn't served for a prior date.
*   **OSG Representation in Criminal Proceedings:** Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), Section 35(1), mandates the OSG to represent the government in criminal proceedings in the appellate courts.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Procedural Errors:** The petitioner erred by failing to include the People of the Philippines as a party in his certiorari petition before the CA and by failing to obtain consent/notify the OSG, violating Section 35(1) of EO 292. This was considered a fatal defect.
*   **Delay and Negligence:** The petitioner, as the complainant, contributed to the delay by failing to diligently secure the presence of his witness (Atty. Ramos) and requesting a subpoena too late.  This failure directly led to the termination of the prosecution's presentation of evidence.
*   **Interlocutory Order:** The trial court's order terminating the presentation of evidence was deemed interlocutory. Certiorari is generally not the proper remedy for interlocutory orders unless there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The petitioner argued that his initial subpoena request should have been considered a continuing request, but the court disagreed. This interpretation hinges on the specific requirements of requesting subpoenas and the diligence expected of the parties.
*   The prosecution asserted that the trial court should have taken more initiative in issuing the subpoena. However, the court placed the onus on the prosecution to actively pursue the presence of their witnesses.

**Legal Precision:**

The SC emphasized that certiorari is an extraordinary remedy reserved for cases where there's grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Errors of judgment are properly addressed through a timely appeal after a final judgment, not through certiorari targeting interlocutory orders. The SC affirmed the CA's finding that the trial court did not act with grave abuse of discretion in terminating the presentation of the prosecution's evidence, given the protracted delays and the petitioner's failure to diligently prosecute his case.
