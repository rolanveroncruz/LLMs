**Legal Document Summary: *Caliawan v. Ocampo***

**Case:** *Rufina L. Caliwan v. Mario Ocampo, et al.* G.R. No. 183270 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision reinstating the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MTC) denial of the Prosecutor's Motion to Withdraw Informations for Light Threats and Slight Physical Injuries against Petitioner Caliwan.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Dispute:** Series of altercations and cross-complaints (Attempted Murder, Slander, Grave Threats, Physical Injuries, Oral Defamation, Alarms and Scandals) arising from a birthday party incident between neighbors.
*   **DOJ Resolution:** The Department of Justice (DOJ) found probable cause against Respondents (Ocampos) for Grave Oral Defamation and Slight Physical Injuries, and against SPO4 Mario Ocampo for Light Threats and ordered Informations to be filed. Critically, the DOJ also ordered the withdrawal of the Informations against Caliwan for Light Threats and Slight Physical Injuries.
*   **MTC Order:** The MTC denied the Prosecutor's Motion to Withdraw the Informations against Caliwan, stating probable cause existed and citing procedural defects (lack of proper notice).
*   **RTC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted Caliwan's Petition for Certiorari and reversed the MTC, ordering the dismissal of the cases against Caliwan, aligning with the DOJ resolution.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, reinstating the MTC's denial of the motion to withdraw the Informations, finding that the trial should continue.
*   **SC Decision:** The Supreme Court DENIED the Petition, agreeing with the CA decision.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Caliwan faces charges of light threats and slight physical injuries, as the withdrawal of the informations were not allowed by the court.
*   Respondents face separate charges based on the DOJ resolution and the informations filed against them.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interlocutory Order & Summary Procedure:** The core issue is whether the RTC should have entertained the Certiorari petition given the interlocutory nature of the MTC's order denying the withdrawal of the Information and the prohibition against certiorari petitions in cases governed by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure (RSP).  *Villanueva, Jr. v. Estoque* supports this point. The Supreme Court held the RTC erred in taking cognizance of the Certiorari petition because of the prohibition in Section 19(g) of the RSP.
*   **Prosecutorial Discretion vs. Court's Power:** The case highlights the tension between the prosecutor's discretion to determine probable cause and file/withdraw cases versus the court's ultimate authority to decide on the merits.  The SC emphasizes that once a case is filed in court, its disposition rests solely with the court, not the prosecutor or DOJ. *Dumlao, Jr. v. Hon. Rodolfo Ponferrada* supports this.
*   **Probable Cause:** The MTC determined that probable cause existed to continue the proceedings against Caliwan, despite the DOJ's contrary finding. The SC doesn't address the merits of this finding but notes that it's within the trial court's discretion. This implies a potential challenge based on sufficiency of evidence to establish probable cause.
*   **Notice and Due Process:** The MTC's initial denial was partly based on the private prosecutor's claim of defective notice for the Motion to Withdraw. The RTC disregarded this. This issue, while initially relevant, becomes moot as the SC based its ruling on the prohibition of certiorari petitions under the Rules of Summary Procedure.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Villanueva, Jr. v. Estoque, A.M. No. RTJ-99-1494 (2000)**:  Clarifies the prohibition against certiorari against interlocutory orders under the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure.
*   **Dumlao, Jr. v. Hon. Rodolfo Ponferrada, G.R. No. 146707 (2006)**:  Emphasizes the court's discretion over the disposition of cases once filed, despite the prosecutor's power to file or withdraw.
*   **Rudecon Management Corporation v. Singson, G.R. No. 150798 (2005):** Defines the term interlocutory order.

**Statutory References:**

*   **1991 Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, Section 19(g):** Prohibits petitions for certiorari against interlocutory orders.
*   **1991 Revised Rules on Summary Procedure, Section 21:** governs appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court prioritized adherence to procedural rules (the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure) over the merits of the DOJ's findings. Caliwan's recourse was to proceed to trial in the MTC and appeal any adverse decision. The central issue remains the charges of Light Threats and Slight Physical Injuries against her. The procedural history of the case and the legal principles highlighted are the main takeaways.
