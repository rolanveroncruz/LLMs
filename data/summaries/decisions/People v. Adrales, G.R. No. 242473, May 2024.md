## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Adrales* (G.R. No. 242473)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for three counts of qualified trafficking in persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003). The CA affirmed the RTC decision with modifications to damages. The Supreme Court upheld the decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 9208, Section 4(a):** Defines acts of trafficking in persons, including recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring, providing, or receiving a person for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, or debt bondage.
*   **RA 9208, Section 6(a):** Qualifies trafficking as "qualified trafficking" when the trafficked person is a child.
*   **RA 9208, Section 3(a):** Defines trafficking in persons as the 'recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge...for the purpose of exploitation.
*   **RA 9208, Section 10(c)/ 10(e) (as amended by RA 10364):** Prescribes the penalty for qualified trafficking as life imprisonment and a fine of not less than PHP 2,000,000.00 but not more than PHP 5,000,000.00.

**Facts:** Adrales recruited, transported, and transferred a 14-year-old minor ("AAA") to various men for sexual exploitation in exchange for money, which he shared with AAA. Adrales was charged with three counts of qualified trafficking.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings, finding Adrales guilty beyond reasonable doubt of qualified trafficking in persons.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Adrales is sentenced to three counts of life imprisonment.
*   Adrales is liable for a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 per count (totaling PHP 6,000,000.00).
*   Adrales is liable for moral damages of PHP 500,000.00 per count (totaling PHP 1,500,000.00) to AAA.
*   Adrales is liable for exemplary damages of PHP 100,000.00 per count (totaling PHP 300,000.00) to AAA.
*   All monetary awards are subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Adrales challenged the credibility of AAA. The court, relying on *Medina, Jr. v. People* (724 Phil. 226 (2014)), found AAA's testimony clear, consistent, and corroborated by the circumstances.  Challenges to this assessment on factual grounds are unlikely to succeed given appellate deference to trial court findings on witness credibility.
*   **"Sexual Abuse Shield Rule" (RECW Section 30(a)):** Adrales attempted to introduce evidence of AAA's alleged prostitution to undermine her credibility and argue she consented. The court properly excluded this evidence citing the sexual abuse shield rule, which aligns with RA 8505 (Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act) and Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 412. This highlights the limited admissibility of the victim's past sexual conduct in trafficking cases.
*   **Victim's Consent:** The defense argued that even if AAA was prostituting herself, she was doing so willingly. The court rejected this defense, citing *People v. Casio* (749 Phil. 458 (2014)), emphasizing that consent is not a defense under RA 9208, Section 3(a) when the victim is a child.
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** The Court noted that Adrales absconded when a warrant of arrest was issued, and stated that the unexplained flight of an accused can be taken as evidence that tends to establish his guilt, citing *People v. Camat* (692 Phil. 55 (2012)).
*   **Analogous Crimes:** The Court reiterates that trafficking in persons is considered an analogous crime to seduction, abduction, rape or other lascivious acts, and the testimony of the victim alone if clear and credible, is sufficient to support the conviction of the accused.

*   *People v. Sanay* (G.R. No. 248113, December 7, 2021)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Adrales' conviction and sentence. The decision reinforces the strict application of RA 9208, particularly the prohibition against using a trafficking victim's past sexual conduct as evidence and the lack of a consent defense when the victim is a minor. Further appeals on factual grounds challenging the lower court's assessment of witness credibility are unlikely to succeed.
