## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. CTA and Wintelecom, Inc. (G.R. No. 203403)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing a Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denying the CIR's Motion for Partial Reconsideration and for Leave to Re-Open the case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), Third Division, and Wintelecom, Inc.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Deficiency Tax Assessment:**  The case involves a Final Assessment Notice (FAN) issued to Wintelecom for alleged deficiency taxes for taxable years 2000 and 2001 amounting to Php 553,344,468.98. This arose from alleged under-declared sales and third-party information. The CTA partially granted Wintelecom’s petition setting aside the deficiency Income Tax assessment, but ordering payment for deficiency VAT and withholding taxes.
*   **Procedural Lapses by CIR:** The CIR repeatedly filed motions for extension of time to file answer, which were eventually denied.  After the case was remanded to the CTA in Division and despite the final warnings, she failed to present evidence in chief, leading to a waiver of the CIR's right to present evidence.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration & Re-opening:** The CIR's motion to set aside the CTA decision and re-open the case, citing heavy workload and witness unavailability as reasons for the initial failure to present evidence, was denied.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The core legal issue is whether the CTA committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the CIR's motion.  The CIR argues that the denial resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the CIR's petition for lack of merit.

**Obligations:**

*   Wintelecom is obligated to pay the reduced amount of P5,949,846.88 for deficiency VAT and withholding taxes, plus a 20% delinquency interest per Section 249(C) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.
*   CIR has an obligation to follow prescribed rules and procedures, and cannot invoke liberal interpretation for repeated neglect and disregard of court orders.

**Liabilities:**

*   CIR is liable for the costs of the petition for certiorari.
*   Wintelecom is liable for the amount ordered to be paid in the CTA’s June 7, 2012 decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Assessment:** The decision potentially impacts the CIR's ability to enforce the initial assessment. The reduced assessment can be considered final and executory.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The SC's ruling reinforces the importance of adherence to procedural rules and cautions against using heavy workload as an excuse.
*   **Reputational Risk:** The CIR's repeated procedural lapses and unsuccessful attempts to circumvent the rules could damage the bureau's reputation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Governs petitions for certiorari.
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Petition for Review before the CTA en banc is the correct remedy to assail CTA resolutions.
*   **Revised Rules of the CTA (RRCTA):** Sections 3(b) and 4(b), Rule 8, deal with appeals to the CTA en banc. Sections 1 and 5 Rule 15 outlines provisions for motions for reconsideration or new trial. Section 6, Rule 15 discusses the required affidavits.
*   **Section 249(C) of the NIRC of 1997:**  Deals with delinquency interest on unpaid taxes.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Yap v. Chua, et al.* (687 Phil. 392):  Defines forum shopping.
    *   *Government Service Insurance System Board of Trustees and Cristina V. Astudillo v. The Hon. Court of Appeals-Cebu City and Former Judge Ma. Lorna P. Demonteverde:*  Certiorari is not a substitute for appeal.
    *   *Yu v. Judge Reyes-Carpio, et al.* (667 Phil. 474):  Defines grave abuse of discretion.
    *   *Republic v. CA* (361 Phil. 319):  Discusses estoppel against the government.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None identified in the summary.

**Analysis:**

The SC rightly found the CIR's recourse to certiorari improper given the availability of appeal to the CTA en banc. The Court correctly noted the finality of the decision due to the failure to file a timely appeal, and strongly rebuked the procedural lapses of the CIR. The SC also affirmed the CTA's decision to deny the motion for reconsideration. The judgment sets precedence for future tax litigation that parties cannot invoke liberal interpretation of rules when repeated neglect is the primary reason for a failure to comply with those rules.
