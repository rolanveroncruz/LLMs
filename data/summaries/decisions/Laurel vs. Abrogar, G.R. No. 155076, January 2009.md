Okay, here's a legal summary of *Laurel v. Abrogar*, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Luis Marcos P. Laurel v. Hon. Zeus C. Abrogar, et al.*, G.R. No. 155076, January 13, 2009.

**Nature:** Motion for Reconsideration of a prior decision granting a petition to quash an Amended Information charging the accused with theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The specific issue is whether international long distance calls and the business of providing telecommunication services are "personal property" subject to theft.

**Facts:**

*   The Amended Information alleges that Laurel, conspiring with others, stole international long distance calls from PLDT by conducting International Simple Resale (ISR), using PLDT's facilities, resulting in damages of P20,370,651.92.
*   Laurel filed a Motion to Quash arguing the Amended Information did not constitute theft. The trial court denied the Motion and the Court of Appeals dismissed Laurel's appeal. The Supreme Court granted Laurel's petition holding that international long distance calls and business of providing telecommunication services are not personal properties under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   PLDT filed a Motion for Reconsideration arguing the Amended Information is valid, citing the Civil Code definition of personal property as anything susceptible of appropriation and not real property. PLDT contends that international calls and its business are capable of appropriation and are therefore subject to theft.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Article 308, Revised Penal Code (Theft):**  Defines theft as the taking of "personal property" belonging to another, with intent to gain, without consent, and without violence or intimidation. The central issue is whether PLDT's long distance calls are personal property susceptible of theft.
*   **Civil Code Definition of Personal Property (Art. 414):**  All things that are or may be the object of appropriation are considered either real property or personal property.
*   **PLDT's Argument:**
    *   International calls are personal property because they are "forces of nature" (electricity) brought under control by science (Art. 416(3), Civil Code).
    *   "Taking" under Article 308 doesn't require asportation, only appropriation.
    *   The act of ISR constitutes an unlawful taking of PLDT's business.
*   **Laurel's Argument:**
    *   A telephone call is a conversation on the phone or a communication carried out using the telephone not electric current or impulses.
    *   Telephone calls do not belong to PLDT, and therefore cannot be stolen from PLDT.
    *   PLDT does not produce or generate telephone calls but rather it provides the facilities or services for the transmission and switching of the calls.
    *   "Business" itself is not personal property.
*   **OSG Argument:**
    *   International phone calls and the business or service of providing international phone calls are subsumed in the enumeration and definition of personal property under the Civil Code and hence, may be proper subjects of theft.
    *   The cases of United States v. Genato, United States v. Carlos and United States v. Tambunting recognized intangible properties like gas and electricity as personal properties.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   **Motion for Reconsideration Granted.** The Court reversed its prior decision.
*   **Key Holding:** The Court held that the business of providing telecommunication services and the telephone service itself are "personal property" under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code. The act of engaging in ISR operations constitutes an unlawful taking of PLDT's services and business. Citing *Strochecker v. Ramirez,* interest in business can be considered as personal property since it is capable of appropriation and not included in the enumeration of real properties.
*   **Remand:** The Court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to amend the Amended Information to clearly state that the *property subject of the theft is the services and business of respondent PLDT,* and not the international long distance calls themselves. This amendment is intended to better apprise the accused of the charges against him and is not considered as a mistake in the designation of the crime.
* The Court further stated that the act of conducting ISR operations by illegally connecting various equipment or apparatus to private respondent PLDT's telephone system, through which petitioner is able to resell or re-route international long distance calls using respondent PLDT's facilities constitutes all three acts of subtraction.
* In 1910, the Court declared that the ownership over electricity (which an international long distance call consists of) as well as telephone service is protected by the provisions on theft of the Penal Code.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 308 (Theft)**
*   **Civil Code, Articles 414, 415, and 416 (Definition of Property)**
*   **United States v. Genato, 15 Phil. 170 (1910):**  Electricity can be subject to theft.
*   **United States v. Carlos, 21 Phil. 553 (1911):** Any personal property, tangible or intangible, corporeal or incorporeal, capable of appropriation can be the object of theft.
*   **United States v. Tambunting, 41 Phil. 364 (1921):**  Further supports that intangible property like gas can be subject to theft.
*   **Strochecker v. Ramirez, 44 Phil. 933 (1922):** Affirmed interest in a business as personal property.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of "Business" as Property:** While the Court holds that business can be personal property, the exact parameters of what constitutes "business" in this context could be subject to further litigation.
*   **Causation:** Establishing the direct causal link between the ISR operations and the precise financial damages suffered by PLDT could present challenges during trial.
* The Court stated that prosecution under Republic Act (RA) No. 8484 or the Access Device Regulations Act of 1998 and RA 8792 or the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 does not preclude prosecution under the Revised Penal Code for the crime of theft.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court, in granting the Motion for Reconsideration, has significantly expanded the scope of "personal property" under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code to include the business of providing telecommunication services. While the court clarified that the subject of the theft are the services and business of PLDT, not the telephone calls themselves, ambiguities remain regarding what constitutes the "business" of PLDT and will likely be the subject of scrutiny in the trial court proceedings after the Information is amended. The implications of this ruling could extend to other intangible services that are susceptible to unauthorized appropriation.
