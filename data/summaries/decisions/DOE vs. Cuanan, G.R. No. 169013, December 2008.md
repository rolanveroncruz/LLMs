Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Department of Education vs. Godofredo G. Cuanan*, G.R. No. 169013, December 16, 2008.

**Facts:** Godofredo Cuanan, a school principal, was accused of sexual harassment. The DECS-RO No. III found him guilty and ordered forced resignation. This was affirmed by the DepEd Secretary. The CSC initially exonerated Cuanan (Resolution No. 030069). DepEd then filed a Petition for Review/Reconsideration with the CSC. Cuanan was reinstated, but the CSC reversed its prior decision and found Cuanan guilty, dismissing him (Resolution No. 041147). Cuanan filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA. The CA granted the petition, setting aside the CSC's dismissal order, citing procedural due process violations and finality of the initial CSC exoneration. The DepEd appealed to the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Administrative Complaints:** Sexual harassment and conduct unbecoming.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** Forced resignation initially; dismissal from service by CSC in later Resolution.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** Core issue is whether Cuanan was afforded due process, specifically whether he was served copies of DepEd's pleadings before the CSC and given an opportunity to respond.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** Was CSC Resolution No. 030069 final and executory when DepEd filed its Petition for Review/Reconsideration?
*   **Remedy:** The DepEd argued that Cuanan used the wrong remedy (Certiorari), instead of a Petition for Review under Rule 43.
*   **Disciplining Authority's Right to Appeal:** Can the DepEd, as the disciplining authority, appeal a CSC decision exonerating an employee? (Affirmed by SC based on *Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy*).
*   **CSC Rules:** Consideration of CSC Resolution No. 021600, which allows the disciplining authority to appeal from a decision exonerating an employee. Also Section 43.A of the Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Obligations:**

*   **DepEd:** To ensure due process in administrative proceedings against its employees. To file appeals of CSC decisions in a timely manner and serve copies of the filings on the adverse party.
*   **CSC:** To adhere to procedural due process requirements in its quasi-judicial functions, including notice and opportunity to be heard.
*   **Cuanan:** To comply with administrative procedures.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **DepEd:** Potential liability for back wages or damages if the dismissal is overturned due to procedural errors. Risk of setting a precedent undermining administrative due process.
*   **Cuanan:** Potential risk of dismissal if the Supreme Court had overturned the CA's ruling.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Proper procedure to appeal CSC decisions.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari. The court can treat the wrongly filed Petition for Certiorari as a Petition for Review because it was filed in a timely manner.
*   ***Civil Service Commission v. Dacoycoy***: Establishes the disciplining authority's standing to appeal exoneration decisions.
*   **Section 43.A. of the Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service**
*   ***Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations***: Administrative bodies must adhere to due process
*   **Gallardo-Corro v. Gallardo:** Once a judgment attains finality, it thereby becomes immutable and unalterable

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The timing of DepEd's receipt of the initial CSC resolution exonerating Cuanan is critical to determining if their appeal was timely. The presumption of regularity of service vs. actual proof of receipt is in contention.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied DepEd's petition and affirmed the CA decision. The Court agreed that Cuanan was denied due process, and that the CSC Resolution exonerating him had become final and executory when the DepEd filed its Petition for Review/Reconsideration.
