## Legal Document Summary: *Lambert S. Ramos v. C.O.L. Realty Corporation* (G.R. No. 184905)

**Case Summary:** This Supreme Court case addresses the issue of liability arising from a vehicular collision. The Court was asked to resolve whether Lambert Ramos (petitioner), the owner of the Ford Expedition driven by Rodel Ilustrisimo, could be held solidarily liable for damages to C.O.L. Realty Corporation (respondent), the owner of the Toyota Altis driven by Aquilino Larin.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Addresses contributory negligence. If the plaintiff's negligence is the immediate and proximate cause of the injury, no recovery. If contributory, damages are mitigated.
*   **Article 2185, Civil Code:** Establishes a presumption of negligence for a driver violating a traffic regulation at the time of the mishap, *juris tantum*
*   **Article 2184, Civil Code:** Governs employer's vicarious liability for the negligent acts of their employees (not explicitly cited but argued in CA).

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Rodel Ilustrisimo (Driver, Ford Expedition):** Potential liability for negligence. The Court of Appeals (CA) found him contributorily negligent for driving at high speed in a construction zone.
*   **Lambert Ramos (Owner, Ford Expedition):** The CA initially held Ramos solidarily liable based on vicarious liability as Rodel's employer. The Supreme Court overturned this, holding him not liable.
*   **Aquilino Larin (Driver, Toyota Altis):** The SC held Aquilino solely responsible because his crossing Katipunan Avenue, which was a violation of the MMDA prohibition, was the proximate cause of the accident, the decision cites *McKee v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 68102, July 16, 1992, 211 SCRA 517.* for the definition of proximate cause.
*   **C.O.L. Realty Corporation (Owner, Toyota Altis):** Ultimately, C.O.L. Realty bears the loss due to the negligence of its driver, Aquilino.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Vicarious Liability (Ramos initially):** Employers are generally responsible for the acts of their employees within the scope of their employment. The CA initially found insufficient evidence to rebut the *juris tantum* presumption of negligence in the selection and supervision of Rodel.
*   **Contributory Negligence (Rodel):** While not ultimately decisive in assigning liability, Rodel's negligence could have been relevant if Ramos were seeking damages from C.O.L. Realty, potentially reducing the award.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The critical factor was determining the proximate cause of the accident.  The SC found that Aquilino's violation of the traffic regulation was the proximate cause, absolving Ramos.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 2179 and 2185:** These articles are central to the analysis of negligence and liability.
*   ***McKee v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 68102, July 16, 1992, 211 SCRA 517.*** (Proximate Cause): Cited for defining the concept of proximate cause, a crucial element in determining liability.
*   **Ford Philippines, Inc. v. Citibank, N.A., G.R. No. 128604, January 29, 2001, 350 SCRA 446** (*Am. Jur. 2d, Volume 58, Negligence, Section 464*): Cited for the principle that if a master is injured by the negligence of a third person and the concurring contributory negligence of his own servant or agent, the latter's negligence is imputed to his superior, assuming of course that the contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the injury of which complaint is made.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Determination of Proximate Cause:** The central point of contention was whether Aquilino's violation of the traffic regulation was the proximate cause or if Rodel's speed was a contributing factor that should impute vicarious liability onto Ramos. The Supreme Court definitively sided with the former.
*   **Rebuttal of Presumption of Negligence:** Ramos presented evidence of screening procedures. The CA initially found this insufficient to rebut the presumption of negligence in selection and supervision of his employee, but this point was rendered moot by the Supreme Court's ultimate ruling.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's ruling dismissing C.O.L. Realty's complaint. Ramos was not held liable.
