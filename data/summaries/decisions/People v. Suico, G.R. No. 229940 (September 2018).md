## Legal Document Summary: People v. Suico (G.R. No. 229940)

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for illegal transportation of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Prohibits and penalizes illegal transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):** Outlines the procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs, emphasizing immediate inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, elected public official, and representative from NPS or media.

**Facts:** Appellant Suico was arrested at a checkpoint after police received information he was transporting marijuana on a motorcycle. He attempted to flee. A search of his bag and sack revealed bundles of marijuana.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding no merit in the appeal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Found guilty of illegal transportation of marijuana, sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Obligated to adhere to the chain of custody requirements outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Potential Risks/Issues & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** Appellant argued a break in the chain of custody due to: (1) failure to immediately mark items upon seizure, (2) marking not in his presence, and (3) absence of testimony from the officer who received the specimen at the crime laboratory (PO1 Adlaon).
    *   **Court Ruling:** The court dismissed this claim citing People vs. Padua, and said not all people who had contact with evidence need to testify. Evidence showed that marking, inventory and taking of photographs were done in his presence. It also noted that RA 10640 amended section 21, specifying immediate marking, inventory, and photography requirements but also provided a saving clause for non-compliance due to justifiable grounds, provided integrity and evidentiary value are preserved. It found officers had complied with the requirements.
*   **Legality of Arrest & Search:** Appellant implicitly challenged the legality of the warrantless search and seizure.
    *   **Court Ruling:** Appellant waived the right to challenge the arrest by failing to file a motion to quash before arraignment (People v. Lara). The court also held that the search was incident to a lawful arrest, justified by probable cause based on informant's tip and Appellant's actions (sudden U-turn and attempted flight).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Lara:** Addresses waiver of objections to illegal arrest by failing to file a motion to quash before arraignment.
*   **Veridiano v. People:** Explains the general rule against warrantless searches and seizures.
*   **People v. Cogaed:** Addresses searches incidental to lawful arrest.
*   **People v. Asislo:** Defines the essential element of illegal transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Morilla:** Defines "transport" under the Dangerous Drugs Act.
*   **People v. Ygot:** Reinforces judicial skepticism towards the defenses of denial and frame-up.
*   **People v. Padua:** States not every person who handles evidence needs to testify as long as chain of custody can be clearly established.
*   **People v. Pasion:** Cites the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by police officers.
*    **People vs. Libnao:** States that witness testimonies need only corroborate each other on important and relevant details concerning the principal occurance.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Illegal transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21, Article II (as amended by RA 10640):** Chain of Custody Requirements.

**Ambiguities/Contentions:**

*   The primary contention revolved around the application of Section 21, RA 9165, specifically regarding the immediacy and location of marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items. The court interpreted RA 10640's amendment as providing flexibility in these requirements, prioritizing preservation of integrity and evidentiary value.
