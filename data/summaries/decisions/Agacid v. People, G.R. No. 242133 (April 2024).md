## Legal Document Summary: Agacid v. People and Bisquerra

**Case:** *Roselyn Agacid y Dejanio vs. People of the Philippines and Maria Alexandria Bisquerra y Nueva* (G.R. No. 242133, April 16, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals Decision which affirmed the Regional Trial Court Orders denying Agacid's Motion to Quash an Information charging her with violation of Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004).

**Key Provision & Issue:**
The central legal issue is whether RA 9262 applies to lesbian relationships, specifically, whether a woman can be charged as the perpetrator of violence against another woman.

**Holding:**
The Supreme Court (SC) held that RA 9262 *does* apply to lesbian relationships. The Petition was denied.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Plain Text:** The SC cited Section 3(a) of RA 9262, noting the use of the gender-neutral term "any person" as the potential offender.
*   **Case Law:**
    *   **Garcia v. Drilon:** The SC reiterated its observation in *Garcia v. Drilon* (712 Phil. 44 (2013)), that the gender-neutral term encompasses lesbian relationships. The court also clarified that the ruling in *Garcia* was not merely *obiter dictum.*
    *   **Jacinto v. Fouts:** The SC relied on *Jacinto v. Fouts* (G.R. No. 250627, December 7, 2022), which squarely addressed the issue of RA 9262's application to lesbian relationships and affirmed *Garcia*.
*   **Legislative Intent:** The SC emphasized the intent of the legislature to extend the law to cover women in lesbian relationships as indicated in the Bicameral Conference Committee Meeting on the Disagreeing Provisions of Senate Bill No. 2723 and House Bill Nos. 6054 and 5516.
*   **Equal Protection:** The Court held that distinguishing between abused women in heterosexual relationships and abused women in lesbian relationships is not a valid classification under the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

**Petitioner's Arguments & SC's Rebuttals:**

*   **Motion to Quash Improperly Denied**: Petitioner argued that a woman cannot be charged under RA 9262 as the law protects women from male abusers. SC rejected, citing plain language of the statute.
*   ***Obiter Dictum* in *Garcia***: Agacid argued the *Garcia* pronouncement was *obiter dictum*. The SC disagreed citing Jacinto which squarely addressed the issue of RA 9262's application to lesbian relationships and affirmed *Garcia*.
*   **Legislative Intent Limited to Male Abusers:** Agacid contended the legislative intent was to protect women from men, pointing to language about "husband and wife" and "common child." The SC pointed to minutes in bicameral conference committee, which indicated the intent of the law was indeed to include lesbian relationships.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Agacid is obligated to stand trial for violating Section 5(a) of RA 9262. Her defense hinges on factual arguments regarding the incident rather than a challenge to the applicability of the law.
*   Bisquerra, as the alleged victim, has the obligation to provide testimony and evidence to support the charges against Agacid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The case will turn on whether the prosecution can prove the elements of Section 5(a) of RA 9262 (physical abuse) beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The admissibility and credibility of Bisquerra's testimony and other evidence will be critical.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None identified.

**Conclusion:** The SC has definitively ruled that RA 9262 applies to lesbian relationships, rejecting arguments that the law's protection is solely for women abused by men. This decision clarifies the scope of the law and ensures equal protection under the law for all women in intimate relationships, regardless of sexual orientation. The case will now proceed to trial on the facts.
