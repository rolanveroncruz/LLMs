**Case Summary: *Sioson v. Heirs of Avanceña***

**Citation:** 600 Phil. 247 (G.R. No. 161387, March 13, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, concerning an ejectment suit.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Ejectment Suit:** Heirs of Avanceña (Respondents) filed an ejectment complaint against the Siosons (Petitioners) alleging that the Siosons' cottages encroached on their Lot No. 934-B-4, covered by TCT No. T-111572. Respondents claimed tolerance and demanded vacation.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** Siosons denied encroachment, claiming their cottages were on Lot No. 934-B-7 (road widening area) or across the Molo-Arevalo Boulevard.
*   **MTCC Decision:** Dismissed the complaint, finding Siosons' cottages on Lot No. 934-B-7, and only the walls encroaching on Lot No. 934-B-4.
*   **RTC Decision (Reversal):** Reversed the MTCC, ordering Siosons to vacate portions of Lot Nos. 934-B-4 and 934-B-7, and to pay rentals and attorney's fees. The RTC concluded the road widening had been abandoned.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the RTC.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the petition, setting aside the CA and RTC decisions and reinstating the MTCC decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The RTC wrongly imposed an obligation for the Siosons to vacate Lot 934-B-7 and pay rentals, as the case was solely about Lot 934-B-4. The Supreme Court reversed this.
*   The Supreme Court did not impose any obligation on the Siosons because it reinstated the MTCC decision which dismissed the complaint for ejectment.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Whether the RTC, on appeal, could decide issues (possession and ownership of Lot No. 934-B-7) *not* raised in the original complaint (limited to Lot No. 934-B-4).
2.  **Factual Findings:** Whether the RTC erred in reversing the MTCC's factual findings regarding the location of the cottages, particularly based on conflicting survey reports.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

1.  **Jurisdictional Error:** The Supreme Court held that the RTC and CA exceeded their jurisdiction by ruling on the possession and ownership of Lot No. 934-B-7, which was not an issue in the ejectment case. Judgments must conform to the pleadings. *Bernas v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 85041, August 5, 1993) was cited regarding the limitations of jurisdiction.
2.  **Erroneous Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court reviewed the factual findings because of conflicting lower court rulings. It found that the RTC relied on an inconsistent and contradictory report and sketch plan. The Court gave credence to the MTCC's finding, based on its own ocular inspection and survey, that the cottages were primarily on Lot No. 934-B-7, and do not encroach on Lot No. 934-B-4.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lot No. 934-B-7 (Road Widening):** The legal status of Lot No. 934-B-7 and the potential for expropriation by the City of Iloilo remain unclear. The decision does *not* grant ownership to the Siosons, merely finds they are not unlawfully occupying Lot 934-B-4. Future actions by the City could affect the Siosons' occupation of Lot No. 934-B-7.
*   **Ambiguous Encroachment Finding:** The MTCC's finding that "only its walls stood on the boundary of Lot No. 934-B-4" implies a minor encroachment. While the complaint for ejectment was dismissed, the heirs of Avanceña could potentially bring a different action based on this minor encroachment (e.g., accion publiciana).
*   **Lack of Clarity on Possession of Lot 934-B-7**: The Court did not determine who has the right to possess Lot No. 934-B-7, only that the Siosons do not encroach on Lot 934-B-4, the subject property in this ejectment suit.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Defines the scope of an ejectment case (physical or material possession only).
*   *Bernas v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 85041, August 5, 1993): Principle that courts cannot decide issues not properly raised.
*   *Liga v. Allegro Resources Corp.* (G.R. No. 175554, 23 December 2008): Judgments must conform to the pleadings and evidence.
* *Lagon v. Hooven Comalco Industries, Inc.*, 402 Phil. 404 (2001): An exception to the rule that only questions of law are appealable to the Supreme Court is where the factual findings of the trial court are in conflict with those of the appellate court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly reversed the CA and RTC, limiting the scope of the ejectment case to the originally pleaded issue (Lot 934-B-4). However, the decision leaves open the possibility of future litigation regarding Lot 934-B-7 and the potential encroachment issue.
