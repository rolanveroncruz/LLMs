Here's a legal summary of *People v. Jacob*, G.R. No. 177151:

**Case Summary: *People v. Jacob*, G.R. No. 177151 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for rape under Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353).

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant, Ariel Jacob, was charged with rape of his 9-year-old cousin, AAA, by force and intimidation.
*   The prosecution presented the victim's testimony, her mother's testimony, and medical evidence of reddish contusions on the labia majora.  Crucially, AAA testified that Jacob inserted his penis into her vagina causing her pain.
*   The defense presented an alibi: Jacob claimed he was on a fishing trip in Lucena City at the time of the incident.  He also argued that the intact hymen proved no rape occurred.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Art. 266-A, RPC (as amended):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation; or when she is under twelve (12) years of age.
*   **Credibility of Victim's Testimony:** The Court emphasizes that in rape cases, the victim's testimony is crucial and can be sufficient for conviction if credible, natural, convincing, and consistent.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The Court reiterated that the alibi defense is inherently weak and must be supported by strong corroborative evidence, which was lacking here. It also noted the inconsistency regarding the time of departure, which affected the defense of impossibility.
*   **Definition of Carnal Knowledge:** *Bali-balita* (G.R. No. 134266) is cited and clarified. The Court reaffirmed that complete penetration is not required for consummation of rape; introduction of the male organ into the labia majora is sufficient. *Dalisay* (G.R. No. 133926) and *Bascugin* (G.R. No. 144195) further support this ruling, highlighting that the labia is sufficient even without hymenal penetration.
*   **Motive of the Victim:** Alleged family misunderstanding as a motive was considered insufficient to overcome the victim's credible testimony.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua, as prescribed by Art. 266-B, RPC.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant is liable for civil indemnity and moral damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   None apparent in the decision itself. The facts are clear, the legal principles are consistently applied, and the ruling is straightforward.
