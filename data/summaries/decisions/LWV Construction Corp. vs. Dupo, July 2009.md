## Legal Document Summary: LWV Construction Corporation vs. Marcelo B. Dupo (G.R. No. 172342)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the NLRC's award of "longevity pay" (service award) to a Filipino worker (Marcelo Dupo) employed in Saudi Arabia by LWV Construction (local recruiter) for Mohammad Al-Mojil Group/Establishment (MMG - foreign principal).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 87, Saudi Labor and Workmen Law (Saudi Labor Law):** The core legal basis for the claim. Grants a "service award" to workers upon termination of a fixed-term contract or cancellation of an indefinite-term contract. The award is calculated as half a month's pay for the first five years of service and one month's pay for each subsequent year.
*   **Article 13, Saudi Labor Law:** One-year prescriptive period for claims relating to rights under the law.
*   **Article 72, Saudi Labor Law:** A labor contract concluded for a specified period shall terminate upon the expiry of its term.
*   **Article 291, Labor Code of the Philippines:** Three-year prescriptive period for money claims arising from employer-employee relations.
*   **Fixed-Term Contracts:** Respondent's employment was based on a series of six fixed-term contracts, each approximately one year in duration.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **LWV Construction (Petitioner):** As the local recruiter, LWV was held liable by the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and Court of Appeals for MMG's failure to pay the service award. This hinges on principles of solidary liability, which is not explicitly addressed but implied by the holding of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC and Court of Appeals.
*   **MMG (Foreign Principal):** Primarily responsible for complying with the Saudi Labor Law, including payment of the service award.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Characterization of "Service Award" vs. "Longevity Pay" vs. "Severance Pay":** The lower tribunals confused the terms, leading to an incorrect application of Article 87. The Supreme Court clarifies that "service award" as granted under Article 87, is NOT "longevity pay" and that severance pay received by respondent covered the service award under the law.
*   **Prescription:** Petitioner argued the claim prescribed under Article 13 of the Saudi Labor Law. However, the Supreme Court applied Article 291 of the Philippine Labor Code, stating that it is broader in scope for money claims. While the case was filed within 3 years, it was mooted because the Supreme Court found that respondent has already received the "service award".
*   **"Offer" of Longevity Pay:** Respondent claimed MMG offered him a specific amount for "longevity pay" prior to his return to the Philippines. The Supreme Court found this claim inconsistent with his prior communications and evidence.
*   **Direct Liability of Local Recruiter:** The decision doesn't fully explore the extent of the local recruiter's solidary liability. Is the local recruiter solidarily liable for foreign law?
*   **Choice of Law:** The decision grapples with applying foreign law (Saudi Labor Law) versus local law (Philippine Labor Code). The borrowing statute (Section 48 of Code of Civil Procedure) is mentioned, but not directly applied due to public policy considerations (protection of labor), as stated in Cadalin v. POEA.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Saudi Labor and Workmen Law (Saudi Labor Law), specifically Article 87, Article 13, and Article 72.**
*   **Labor Code of the Philippines, specifically Article 291.**
*   **Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora (G.R. No. 48494):** Established principles regarding fixed-term contracts in overseas employment.
*   **Cadalin v. POEA's Administrator (G.R. Nos. 104776 and 104911-14):** Applied Article 291 to overseas contract workers and discussed the application of foreign prescriptive periods.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals, NLRC, and Labor Arbiter, ruling that the respondent's claim for a service award had already been satisfied through his severance pay. The Supreme Court also held that, though the prescriptive period did not apply in this case as it was moot, the case would have fallen under Article 291 instead of Article 13 of the Saudi Labor Law.
