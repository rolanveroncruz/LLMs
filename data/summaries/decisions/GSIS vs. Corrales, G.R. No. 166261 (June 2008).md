## Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. Corrales (G.R. No. 166261, June 27, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the ECC and GSIS's denial of Astrid Corrales' claim for disability benefits under P.D. No. 626.

**Key Issue:** Whether Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is compensable under P.D. No. 626, specifically under item 18 of Annex "A" ("Cardiovascular diseases") of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DENIED the GSIS petition, affirming the CA decision and ordering GSIS to pay disability benefits to Corrales.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **GSIS Argument:** CHD is a congenital and genetic condition, not an occupational disease or work-related, and existed prior to employment. Cites *Robbins, Pathologic Basis of Disease* for the definition of CHD.
*   **Corrales Argument:** CHD is a form of cardiovascular disease, listed as a compensable disease in Annex "A."
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   "Cardiovascular diseases" in Annex "A" is interpreted broadly to include all heart diseases, including CHD.
    *   While CHD is congenital, its manifestation and aggravation can be work-related.
    *   Applied ECC Resolution No. 432 and item 18 of Annex "A" concerning cardiovascular diseases.
    *   Found that Corrales met the third condition of item 18, where a person asymptomatic before work-related strain shows symptoms of cardiac injury during work, and such symptoms persist.
    *   The court found that the employee while being symptomatic before working at the Commission on Audit but the certification of the Chief of the Procurement Division, General Services of the COA showed that it was more stressful after the Employee took the position of Clerk III.

**Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 626:** Basis for Employees' Compensation benefits.
*   **Annex "A" of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation:** Lists occupational and compensable diseases.
*   **Labor Code (as amended by P.D. No. 626), Articles 191 & 192:** Authority for ECC regulations on disability benefits.
*   **ECC Resolution No. 432:** Adds certain categories of diseases to Annex "A."

**Case Law References:**

*   **Santos v. Employees' Compensation Commission (221 SCRA 182 [1993]):** Upholds liberality in interpreting laws favoring workers.
*   **Salmone v. Employees' Compensation Commission (341 SCRA 150 [20001]):** Government estopped from denying benefits based on pre-existing conditions known at the time of employment.

*   **Government Service Insurance System v. Baul (G.R. No. 166556, July 31, 2006):**  Disability from occupational disease is compensable without proof of causal relation.
*   **Employees' Compensation Commission v. Court of Appeals (332 Phil. 278 (1996))** Work-relatedness of genetic condition
*   **Government Service Insurance System v. Palma (G.R. No. 167572, July 27, 2007):** Work-relatedness of genetic condition
*   **Government Service Insurance System v. Valenciano (G.R. No. 168821, April 10, 2006):**  Yardstick is probability, not certainty, interpret doubts in favor of employees.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Causation Argument:** GSIS argued lack of direct causation, but the court adopted a looser standard of "substantial evidence" and "mere probability" to establish causal relationship, leaning towards social justice for the employee.
*   The court found that the new position was stressful enough to cause a cardiac injury.

**Obligations:**

*   **GSIS:** Pay full disability benefits to Astrid Corrales as provided under P.D. No. 626.
