## Legal Document Summary: *Republic v. Yap*, G.R. No. 231116 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's grant of respondent Claro Yap's petition for cancellation and re-issuance of Decree No. 99500 and issuance of corresponding OCT covering Lot No. 922.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Grant of Petition:** RTC ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel and re-issue Decree No. 99500 in the name of Andres Abellana, as Administrator of the Estate of Juan Rodriguez, and to issue an OCT. CA affirmed this decision.
*   **Basis of Claim:** Yap claimed ownership via inheritance and donation, coupled with open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945 (or earlier) and/or acquisitive prescription.

**Obligations:**

*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligated to cancel Decree No. 99500, re-issue it, and issue the corresponding OCT in the name of Andres Abellana, as Administrator of the Estate of Juan Rodriguez, upon payment of fees.
*   **Yap:** Furnishing of reissued copy of Decree No. 99500 and copy of title upon payment of appropriate fees.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Government's Claim of Prescription/Laches:** The OSG argued that Yap's action was barred by the statute of limitations and failure to execute the decree within 5 years. Court relies on prior court decisions such as  *Sta. Ana v. Menla*, *Heirs of Cristobal Marcos v. de Banuvar*, and *Ting v. Heirs of Diego Lirio* to state that prescription and Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court do not apply in land registration proceedings.
*   **Indispensable Parties (Heirs of Rodriguez/Abellana):** OSG initially argued non-joinder of indispensable parties (heirs of Juan Rodriguez/Andres Abellana). This argument was rejected because the CA classified the RTC proceeding as an *in rem* proceeding.
*   **Ministerial Duty to issue OCT:** The judgement does not need to be executed within the purview of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
*    **Requirement of True Copy:** Section 39 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 ("Property Registration Decree") necessitates the old decree's cancellation for the OCT to be an exact replica.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 6, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Regarding execution of judgments. (deemed inapplicable)
*   **Article 1144, Civil Code:** On prescriptive periods for actions. (deemed inapplicable)
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Specifically Section 39, regarding preparation of decree and certificate of title.

**Case Law:**

*   **Sta. Ana v. Menla:** Key precedent regarding inapplicability of prescription to land registration cases.
*   **Heirs of Cristobal Marcos v. de Banuvar** Reinforces *Sta. Ana v. Menla*
*   **Ting v. Heirs of Diego Lirio:** Reaffirms *Sta. Ana v. Menla*
*   **Republic v. Heirs of Sanchez:** Discusses the procedure for cancellation and re-issuance of decrees.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent, but the government's persistent raising of the issue of prescription despite established jurisprudence is notable.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA and RTC decisions, primarily relying on the established doctrine that prescription and execution rules do not apply to land registration proceedings. The key issue revolves around the re-issuance of the decree to allow for the issuance of a "true copy" OCT as mandated by PD 1529. The government's arguments regarding prescription and non-joinder were unsuccessful. No major risks are identified, and the judgment appears solid based on existing precedent. The decision confirms the ministerial duty of the Register of Deeds to issue the OCT.
