## Legal Document Summary: *Ariel M. Los Baños vs. Joel R. Pedro*, G.R. No. 173588, April 22, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision permanently dismissing a case against Respondent Joel R. Pedro (Pedro) for violation of the election gun ban under Batas Pambansa Bilang 881 (Omnibus Election Code).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Section 8, Rule 117 of the Rules of Court (Provisional Dismissal) applies to a dismissal following a Motion to Quash. The Supreme Court (SC) holds it *does not*.
*   **Background:** Pedro was charged for illegal possession of firearm during election period (Sec. 261(q) of the Omnibus Election Code (Code) ) after being caught at a police checkpoint. He filed a Motion to Quash based on a Comelec Certification exempting him from the gun ban. The RTC initially granted the motion. Subsequently, the prosecution presented evidence that the Comelec Certification was forged. The RTC reopened the case, but the CA reversed, applying the time-bar provision in Sec. 8, Rule 117 (provisional dismissal becoming permanent after one year).
*   **Petitioner's (Los Baños) Argument:** Sec. 8, Rule 117 applies *only* to provisional dismissals consented to by the accused or initiated by the prosecution. It *does not* cover dismissals based on a motion to quash. Further, an order sustaining a motion to quash does not bar another prosecution for the same offense, unless the motion was based on extinction of criminal liability or double jeopardy, neither of which applies here. (Cites Section 6 of Rule 117.)  Respondent's reliance on the supposed forged COMELEC exemption is a matter *aliunde*, not appropriate for a motion to quash based on legal excuse found on the face of the Information.

*   **Respondent's (Pedro) Argument:** The CA correctly applied Sec. 8, Rule 117, making the dismissal permanent due to the lapse of one year from receipt of the quashal order by the prosecutor.

**SC Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **Meritorious Petition:** The SC *reversed* the CA decision.
*   **Quashal vs. Provisional Dismissal:**  The SC explicitly differentiates a Motion to Quash (Rule 117, Sec. 3) from a Provisional Dismissal (Rule 117, Sec. 8). The SC emphasizes the differences in scope, grounds, consequences, and timing between the two. It notes that provisional dismissal creates a bar to further prosecution under the special terms of Section 8. Conversely, when a dismissal is pursuant to a motion to quash under Section 3, Section 8 and its time-bar does not apply.
*   **Sec. 8 Inapplicable:**  The SC held that Sec. 8, Rule 117 *does not* apply to the reopening of the case as the quashing of the Information does not qualify as a provisional dismissal. The grounds cited by Pedro in his Motion to Quash were Section 3(a) [facts do not constitute an offense] and 3(h) [averments constitute legal excuse/justification]. The SC finds that the Information duly charged an offense and that the Comelec certification is a matter *aliunde* that cannot support a Motion to Quash based on Section 3(h). The motion was erroneously granted.
*   **Amendment to Information:** The SC orders the RTC to arraign and try Pedro, *after* reflecting the amendment introduced on Section 261(q) of the Code by Section 32 of Republic Act No. 7166. (Carry firearm under authority of COMELEC)

**Obligations:**

*   **RTC:** Arraign and try Pedro.
*   **Prosecution:** Amend the Information to reflect the amendment to Section 261(q) of the Code by Section 32 of R.A. No. 7166.

**Liabilities:**

*   Pedro remains potentially liable under the amended Information for violation of the election gun ban.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** The initial error by the RTC in granting the motion to quash based on extraneous evidence could be raised again.
*   **Factual Issues:**  The validity of the original stop, search, and seizure may be challenged.
*   **Prescription:** Although prescription was not the primary issue, it should be considered as a secondary argument, given the time elapsed since the incident.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 881 (Omnibus Election Code):** Section 261(q) (as amended by R.A. 7166, Sec. 32) - Illegal Possession of Firearm during Election Period.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 117:** Motion to Quash (Sec. 3), Provisional Dismissal (Sec. 8), Effect of Sustaining Motion to Quash (Sec. 6).
*   *People v. Lacson*, G.R. No. 149453, April 1, 2003 (Elements of Provisional Dismissal)
*   *People v. Navarro*, G.R. No. L-1 & L-2, December 4, 1945 (Admissibility of additional facts in motion to quash)
*   *Abenes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 156320, February 14, 2007 (Amendment of information to Section 261(q) of the Code).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's initial denial of the petition followed by a reversal upon reconsideration is a point of contention.
*   The COMELEC certification as a basis for quashing the Information and its alleged forgery.

**Key Takeaway:** The SC clarifies the distinct legal principles between a Motion to Quash and a Provisional Dismissal, ensuring the case proceeds to trial.  The issue of the COMELEC certification and its legitimacy will likely be a focus during trial.
