**Legal Document Summary: Borromeo and Parcia v. Lazada E-Services Philippines, Inc.**

**Case:** G.R. No. 265610, April 03, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding no employer-employee relationship.

**Key Issue:** Whether Borromeo and Parcia (Petitioners), pick-up riders for Lazada (Respondent), were independent contractors or regular employees and, consequently, whether their termination was illegal.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the Petition, reversing the CA decision and finding that Borromeo and Parcia were regular employees illegally dismissed by Lazada.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA):** Lazada argued Petitioners were independent contractors based on signed ICAs, DTI/BIR registrations, use of own vehicles, and explicit contractual clauses disclaiming an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Claimed they were regular employees, alleging the ICAs were a sham, relying on Ditiangkin v. Lazada (G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022) which invalidated similar agreements, and meeting the four-fold test for employer-employee relationship.
*   **Four-Fold Test Application:** SC found Lazada controlled not only the result, but also the means and methods, requiring route sheets, reporting arrival times to supervisors, scanning items using Lazada-provided equipment. This control, plus payment of wages, power of dismissal, and engagement of employees led to a finding of an employer-employee relationship
*    **Economic Reality Test Application**: The rider have a high degree of dependency of the worker upon the employer for his continued employment in that line of business. The services performed by the petitioners are an integral part of the respondent's business.
*   **Ditiangkin v. Lazada:** SC relied heavily on the Ditiangkin case, finding the factual circumstances to be practically identical, emphasizing the economic dependency and level of control exerted by Lazada.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Lazada's Obligations:**
    *   Reinstate Borromeo and Parcia to their former positions.
    *   Pay full backwages, holiday pay, holiday premium pay, rest day premium pay, service incentive leave pay, thirteenth month pay, surety bond deposit, and other benefits from the time of illegal dismissal until reinstatement.
*   **Monetary Award Computation:** Case remanded to the Labor Arbiter for computation of monetary benefits. All awards subject to 6% interest per annum from the date of finality until full payment.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Doronollo, Ancheta, Delantar, and Reyes were *not* held solidarily liable with Lazada, as no bad faith was proven in the dismissal.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 106, Labor Code:** Contractor or Subcontractor.
*   **Article 295 (formerly 280), Labor Code:** Regular and casual employment.
*   **Article 294, Labor Code:** Rights of illegally dismissed employees.

**Case Law:**

*   **Ditiangkin v. Lazada, G.R. No. 246892, September 21, 2022:**  Crucially important precedent that the SC relied upon given similar facts.
*   **Royale Homes Marketing Corp. v. Alcantara, 739 Phil. 744 (2014):** Four-fold test for employer-employee relationship.
*   **San Miguel Foods, Inc. v. Rivera, 824 Phil. 961 (2018):**  Defines control as it relates to employer-employee relationship.
*   **Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission, 532 Phil. 399 (2006):** Economic Reality Test.
*   **Fuji Television Network, Inc. v. Espiritu, 749 Phil. 388, 424 (2014):** Definition of Independent Contractor

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of Backwages and Benefits:** The specific amounts of backwages, holiday pay, and other benefits still need to be computed by the Labor Arbiter, leaving room for potential disputes during the computation phase.
*   **Reinstatement Viability:** If reinstatement is no longer viable, separation pay will be awarded, requiring further determination of equivalent amount.
*   **No Moral and Exemplary Damages:** Limited recovery as moral and exemplary damages were not awarded.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration and Appeal:** The judgment is subject to motion for reconsideration and further appeal, with the possibility of further modification or reversal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the CA's decision, emphasizing the existing precedent in Ditiangkin v. Lazada. This decision underscores the Court's willingness to look beyond contractual labels and examine the actual economic realities and level of control exerted by employers when determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Lazada is obligated to reinstate the petitioners and provide full backwages and benefits.
