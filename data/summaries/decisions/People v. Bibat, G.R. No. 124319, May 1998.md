Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *People v. Bibat*, G.R. No. 124319, May 13, 1998.

**Case Summary: *People v. Bibat***

**Issue:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Gari Bibat for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The key issues on appeal are the credibility of prosecution witnesses, the validity of the alibi defense, and the proper appreciation of evident premeditation.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the RTC decision, finding Bibat guilty of Murder and imposing the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Information:** Bibat was charged with Murder for the stabbing death of Lloyd del Rosario, alleging conspiracy, treachery, and evident premeditation.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from Nona Avila Cinco, who claimed to have seen Bibat stab the victim. Rogelio Robles, also testified to witnessing the murder. A key point is Cinco's delay in reporting the crime (9 months), attributed to fear of reprisal, which the Court found acceptable.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Bibat presented an alibi, claiming he was at school taking an exam at the time of the murder.  He also presented corroborating witnesses, but their testimony was deemed insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence. Robles initially testified to the murder, then recanted.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, emphasizing the trial court's opportunity to observe witness demeanor.  The Court considered the possible issue that Robles retracted his statement, but ultimately ruled it credible.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The alibi defense was rejected as weak and easily fabricated. The Court cited People v. Magana, G.R. No. 105673, for the proposition that an alibi must establish physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene, which was not proven here.  The proximity of the school to the crime scene further weakened the alibi.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** The Court found that evident premeditation was sufficiently proven to elevate the crime to murder. Citing People v. Leano, C.A. 36 O.G. 1120; People v. Diva, et al., G. R. No. L-22946, evident premeditation requires:
    *   Time of determination to commit the crime.
    *   An overt act indicating adherence to that determination.
    *   Sufficient lapse of time for reflection.
    * The Court inferred the plan from (1) Cinco's testimony about overhearing a plan to kill someone at Funeraria Gloria, and (2) Bibat's actions leading up to the stabbing.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Bibat is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Bibat is liable for:
    *   ₱49,786.14 as actual damages to the heirs of the victim.
    *   ₱50,000.00 as moral damages to the heirs of the victim.
    *   Payment of costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Recanted Testimony:** The reliance on Robles' initial testimony, despite his subsequent retraction, could be a point of contention, even though such retractions are viewed with suspicion. The credibility finding is heavily dependent on the trial court's assessment, which could be challenged on appeal if there were strong grounds to believe the recantation was truthful.
*   **Inference of Premeditation:** While the Court found sufficient evidence of premeditation, this element is always subject to scrutiny. A strong argument could be made that the evidence was circumstantial and did not conclusively prove a pre-existing plan to kill the victim.
* **Chain of Evidence:** A risk might exist if there were gaps or inconsistencies in the chain of custody of any physical evidence (e.g., the alleged stabbing weapon), although the summary doesn't mention any physical evidence besides testimonies.
