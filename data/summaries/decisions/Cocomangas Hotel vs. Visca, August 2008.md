## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 167045, August 29, 2008 (Cocomangas Hotel Beach Resort vs. Visca, et al.)

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the NLRC resolution, addressing illegal dismissal claims by Federico F. Visca, et al. against Cocomangas Hotel Beach Resort and/or Susan Munro.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The central issue is the status of the respondents: whether they are regular employees or project employees/independent contractors.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Respondents allege illegal dismissal after being told not to report for work due to purported budgetary constraints, followed by the hiring of new workers.
*   **Backwages:** Respondents pray for reinstatement with full backwages, premium pay for rest day, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, cost-of-living allowance, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Reinstatement**: In the decision, the illegally dismissed employee shall be entitled to reinstatement, full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Cocomangas Hotel/Munro):**  Potentially liable for backwages, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, attorney's fees, and damages if found to be the respondents' employer and to have illegally dismissed them. Ordered to pay compensation to the employees from when their compensation was withheld up to the time of their actual reinstatement.
*   **Respondents (Visca, et al.):** Obligated to prove the existence of an employer-employee relationship and illegal dismissal to be entitled to remedies.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misclassification of Employees:** Risk of misclassifying regular employees as project employees or independent contractors, leading to illegal dismissal claims.
*   **Labor Code Violations:** Risk of violating the Labor Code provisions on security of tenure and termination of employment.
*   **Financial Liability:** Significant potential financial exposure due to backwages, benefits, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Art. 279):** Addresses security of tenure and remedies for illegal dismissal (reinstatement, backwages, etc.).
*   **Policy Instruction No. 20:** Requires reporting of termination of project employees to the nearest employment office; failure to do so may evidence that employees are regular employees.
*   **Department Order No. 19** Relates to rules on submission of a report of an employee's termination to the nearest public employment office every time his employment is terminated due to a completion of a project.
*   **Zarate, Jr. v. Olegario:** Case that describes the extent of judicial review by certiorari of decisions or resolutions of the NLRC
*   **Garcia v. National Labor Relations Commission** This case states when certiorari can be properly resorted to.
*   **Maraguinot, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission** Once the employee has been continuously rehired by the same employer for the same tasks of the same nature, and these tasks are vital, necessary and indispensable to the usual business or trade of the employer, then the employee must be deemed a regular employee.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Project Employee":** Disagreement on whether the respondents' work was tied to specific projects with a predetermined termination date.
*   **Necessity of Services:** Whether the maintenance and repair work performed by the respondents was "necessary or desirable" to the usual trade or business of the resort.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Petitioners changed their argument from claiming there was no employer-employee relationship with respondents, and changing it to the termination of the period of their employer-employee relationship.

**Legal Analysis:**

The central issue is whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the NLRC resolution and finding the respondents to be regular employees who were illegally dismissed. The CA properly gave due course to the petition for certiorari as the NLRC made a turnabout from finding respondents as regular employees to project employees. The Supreme Court finds that the Court of Appeals did not err in finding that the respondents were regular employees, and were entitled to the award for backwages from the time compensation was withheld up to the time of actual reinstatement.
