**Case Summary: *Leah B. Taday vs. Atty. Dionisio B. Apoya, Jr.*, A.C. No. 11981, July 03, 2018 (835 Phil. 13)**

**Subject:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Dionisio B. Apoya, Jr. for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's recommendation of disbarment.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Canon 1, Rules 1.01 and 1.02 CPR:**  Found guilty of unlawful, dishonest, immoral, and deceitful conduct.  Specifically, engaging in acts lessening confidence in the legal system.
*   **Section 2, Rule IV, 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice:** Violated the rule requiring personal appearance of the signatory during notarization.

**Key Allegations & Findings of Fact:**

1.  **False Decision:**  Respondent authored and delivered a fake court decision to the complainant, an OFW seeking annulment of marriage.  The decision was purportedly from a non-existent RTC branch and judge.  The content closely mirrored the annulment petition drafted by the respondent, including grammatical errors.
2.  **Improper Notarization:** Respondent notarized the Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping in the petition when the complainant was not physically present in the Philippines (in Norway), violating notarial rules.
3.  **Motion to Withdraw Petition:**  Upon being confronted about the fake decision, Respondent filed a motion to withdraw the petition he originally filed.  The RTC granted the motion and dropped the case.
4.  **Failure to Respond to New Counsel:** The Respondent did not respond to the letter of the new counsel of the Complainant regarding the fake decision and legal fees.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty to uphold the law and promote respect for legal processes (Canon 1 CPR).
*   Duty to avoid dishonest or deceitful conduct (Rule 1.01 CPR).
*   Duty to not lessen confidence in the legal system (Rule 1.02 CPR).
*   Obligation as a notary public to ensure the personal presence of the affiant during notarization (Section 2, Rule IV, 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:**  The Court ordered respondent disbarred.
*   **Striking of Name from the Roll of Attorneys:** Respondent's name was ordered stricken from the roll of attorneys.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues (Defense Arguments & Rebuttals):**

*   **Respondent's Defense 1: Lack of Knowledge of Complainant's Location:** Respondent claimed he was unaware the complainant was an OFW in Norway during notarization. *Court Rebuttal:* Even if true, he should have refrained from notarizing the document until her personal appearance.
*   **Respondent's Defense 2: Fake Decision Created by Complainant's Parents:** Respondent alleged the fake decision was created by the complainant's parents. *Court Rebuttal:*  Illogical, given they were paying his fees and had no motive to create a fake decision that wouldn't benefit the client.
*   **Respondent's Defense 3: Not Filing the Motion to Withdraw:** He drafted the Motion but did not file it. *Court Rebuttal:*  This was contradicted by the RTC order, which stated the Motion was indeed filed by the respondent.

**Relevant Case Law Cited:**

*   *Luna v. Atty. Galarrita, 763 Phil. 175, 184 (2015)*:  Highlights the fiduciary nature of lawyer-client relationships.
*   *Velasco v. Atty. Doroin, et al., 582 Phil. 1, 9 (2008)*:  Reinforces the principle that a lawyer's right to practice law is conditional upon good behavior.
*   *Ferguson v. Atty. Ramos, A.C. No. 9209, April 18, 2017*: Concerns the misrepresentation arising from notarizing a document without the presence of the parties.
*   *Krursel v. Atty. Abion, 789 Phil. 584 (2016)*: A similar case of disbarment for drafting a fake court order.
*   *Gatchalian Promotions Talents Pool, Inc. v. Atty. Naldoza, 374 Phil. 1 (1999)*: Disbarment for falsifying an official court receipt.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None particularly ambiguous.  The core issue is the blatant dishonesty and violation of professional duties, leading to a straightforward disbarment.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Apoya's actions demonstrated a clear disregard for professional ethics and notarial practice, undermining the integrity of the legal system. The fabrication of a court decision and improper notarization, coupled with weak and contradictory defenses, justified the Supreme Court's decision to disbar him. This case underscores the importance of honesty, integrity, and adherence to established rules within the legal profession.
