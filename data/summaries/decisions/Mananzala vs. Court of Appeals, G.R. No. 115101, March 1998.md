**Legal Document Summary: Mananzala v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115101 (1998)**

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over a parcel of land in Quezon City. Petitioner Mananzala, the registered owner, was sued by Respondent Arañez for specific performance based on a deed of sale allegedly executed in 1960. The deed stipulated that title transfer would occur 30 days after Mananzala fully paid the PHHC (now NHA) for the property. The CA reversed the RTC's dismissal of the complaint and ordered Mananzala to convey the property. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Sale (March 22, 1960):** Contract between Mananzala and Arañez for the sale of the land. Critical provision: title transfer 30 days after Mananzala's full payment to PHHC.
*   **Transfer Certificate of Title No. 32314 (January 15, 1985):** Issued to Mananzala after full payment to NHA.
*   **Conditional Sale (Prior to TCT):** Original agreement between Mananzala and PHHC.

**Obligations:**

*   **Mananzala:** Allegedly obligated under the 1960 deed of sale to transfer ownership to Arañez after obtaining title from NHA.

**Liabilities:**

*   Mananzala is liable to specifically perform the 1960 deed of sale by transferring title to Arañez.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of 1960 Deed of Sale:** The validity of a deed of sale transferring property she did not yet have title to.
*   **Defense of Fraud/Forgery:** Mananzala initially claimed the deed was a forgery or her signature was fraudulently obtained, but this claim was undermined by the NBI report and the trial court's finding that the signature was genuine. She then argued, in the alternative, that the contract was void.
*   **PHHC Restrictions:** Mananzala's original defense included that the sale violated PHHC rules against the subsequent disposition of land within one year of title issuance. This was not considered at appeal, thus deemed waived. This presents a *potential risk* if PHHC/NHA rules indeed restricted such sales.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1461, Civil Code:** Cited by the CA to justify the sale of things with potential existence.
*   **Ibay v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 209 SCRA 510 (1992):** Distinguished based on the lack of evidence of a violation of PHHC rules, unlike in *Ibay*.
*   **Joson v. Baltazar, 194 SCRA 114, 119 (1991) and Favor v. Court of Appeals, 194 SCRA 308, 313 (1991):** Cited on the presumption of regularity of notarized documents.
*   **Arts. 1305 and 1409 of the Civil Code**: Cited by the RTC regarding void contracts.
*   **Relevant PHHC/NHA rules and regulations:** Crucial to determine if the 1960 sale, or the sale within one year of the title issuance, violated any prohibitions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Condition Precedent:** Whether Mananzala's full payment to PHHC automatically triggered the obligation to transfer title, regardless of other potential restrictions.
*   **Waiver:** Whether Mananzala's failure to fully argue the PHHC restriction defense on appeal constitutes a waiver.

**Analysis:**

The SC upheld the CA's decision to require Mananzala to convey the property to Arañez. While the deed of sale was executed before Mananzala had full title, the court found that a valid agreement existed and was supported by the finding that Mananzala's signature was genuine. Critically, the defense based on PHHC regulations was not properly raised on appeal, and was deemed waived, potentially overlooking a valid basis to void the sale.
