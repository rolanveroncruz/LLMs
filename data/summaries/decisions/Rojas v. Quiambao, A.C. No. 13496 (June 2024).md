## Legal Document Summary: *Atty. Merriam Fe G. Rojas vs. Atty. Lovejoy Quiambao* (A.C. No. 13496)

**Nature:** Disbarment case against Atty. Lovejoy Quiambao based on a complaint filed by his former wife, Atty. Merriam Fe G. Rojas.

**Holding:** Atty. Quiambao is found GUILTY of four counts of Grossly Immoral Conduct and is DISBARRED. He is also fined a total of PHP 400,001.00.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Grossly Immoral Conduct:** The court found four separate instances constituting Grossly Immoral Conduct under the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) Canon II, Sections 1 & 2, Canon III, Section 2, and Canon VI, Section 33(f).
    *   **Count 1:** Flagrant extramarital affairs with at least three women (CCC, BBB, and HHH) during his marriage to the complainant, constituting disregard for the sanctity of marriage.
    *   **Count 2:** Siring two illegitimate children with HHH, entering a potentially bigamous marriage with her after legal separation but without annulment or dissolution of his first marriage, and publicly flaunting this relationship.
    *   **Count 3 & 4:** Sexual harassment of AAA (house helper) and DDD (law secretary), through showing pornographic materials and engaging in sexually charged conversations. The court found respondent sexually harassed two of his employees AAA, his house helper, and DDD his law secretary. As per Section 3(a)(3) of Republic Act No. 7877, an act or conduct of a sexual nature for purposes of sexual gratification which is generally annoying, disgusting, or offensive to the victim, is a form of sexual harassment.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Disbarment: Atty. Quiambao's name is to be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.
*   Fines: Total fines of PHP 400,001.00. (1) PHP 100,061.00 for the second count of Grossly Immoral Conduct; (2) PHP 150,000.00 for the third count of Grossly Immoral Conduct; and (3) PHP 150,000.00 for the fourth count of Grossly Immoral Conduct
*   Future Considerations: Disbarment and subsequent related penalties for 2nd-4th counts to be seriously considered should he apply for reinstatement/judicial clemency.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Bigamy:** The judgment hinges on the determination that no dissolution of marriage to the complainant had occurred prior to the subsequent marriage to HHH. Proving a valid annulment/dissolution could potentially challenge the bigamy finding, although the disbarment is rooted in other, independent grounds.
*   **Aggravating Factors:** The court underscored the vulnerability of the victims and the prolonged nature of the misconduct when determining the penalties to be imposed. These facts are unlikely to be successfully challenged unless previously unknown mitigating factors are revealed.
*   **CPRA Application:** CPRA was applied retroactively to the case. Despite the transition provision, the court found no injustice in its application.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA):** Canon II (Propriety), Canon III (Fidelity), Canon VI (Grossly Immoral Conduct), Sections 1, 2, and 33(f).
*   **Family Code of the Philippines:** Articles on marriage as an inviolable institution and legal separation.
*   **Republic Act No. 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995):** Section 3(a)(3) defines work-related sexual harassment.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** The decision references numerous cases, including *Guevarra v. Atty. Eala*, *Arnobit v. Atty. Arnobit*, *Dr. Perez v. Atty. Catindig*, *Atty. Saludares v. Atty. Saludares*, *Dantes v. Atty. Dantes*, *Valdez v. Atty. Dabon*, and *Re: Anonymous Complaint against Atty. Untian*, to support its findings on grossly immoral conduct and the appropriateness of disbarment.

**Overall Assessment:**

The court's decision is comprehensive, well-reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence. The respondent's admissions significantly weakened his defense. Any appeal would face a steep uphill battle, particularly given the court's emphasis on upholding the integrity of the legal profession and the gravity of the respondent's offenses.
