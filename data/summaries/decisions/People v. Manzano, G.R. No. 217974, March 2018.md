## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Manzano* (G.R. No. 217974)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the CA decision, which affirmed the RTC's conviction of Rezor Juanillo Manzano for Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** SC affirmed the conviction of Rezor Juanillo Manzano for murder. Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Self-Defense Rejected:** Accused's claim of self-defense was rejected due to lack of unlawful aggression by the victim. The SC emphasized the burden of proving self-defense lies with the accused (citing numerous cases, e.g., *Ocampo v. People*, 759 Phil. 423, 431 (2015)).
*   **Treachery Established:** The Court found treachery was present as a qualifying circumstance, as the attack was swift, deliberate, unexpected, and ensured the victim had no chance to resist. This elevated the crime to murder (citing *People v. Sibbu*, G.R. No. 214757, 29 March 2017).
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength Merged:** Abuse of superior strength was considered absorbed by the finding of treachery (citing *People v. Bosito*, 750 Phil. 183, 193 (2015)).
*   **No Voluntary Surrender:** The claim of voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance was rejected. Reno Manzano requesting police to take custody of the accused means that it was essentially him being captured (citing *Belbis, Jr. v. People*, 698 Phil. 706, 724 (2012)).

**Obligations:**

*   The accused is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The accused is obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages to the victim's heirs. (citing *People v. Jugueta*, G.R. No. 202124, 5 April 2016, 788 SCRA 331, 348).

    *   Temperate damages: P50,000.00
    *   6% interest per annum on all monetary awards from finality until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness (Victoria Silava):** Accused had attacked the inconsistencies in Victoria's testimonies, but the Court found the discrepancies minor and inconsequential, upholding the RTC's assessment of her credibility.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence and Incomplete Self-Defense:**  Accused argued for incomplete self-defense as a privileged mitigating circumstance, but the Court found no basis, emphasizing the lack of unlawful aggression by the victim.
*   **Proof of Victim's Income:** Claim for loss of earning capacity denied because of unsubstantiated/self serving evidence.
