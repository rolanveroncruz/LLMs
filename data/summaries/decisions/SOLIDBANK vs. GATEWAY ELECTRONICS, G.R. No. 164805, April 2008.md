## Legal Document Summary: Solidbank vs. Gateway Electronics

**Case:** *Solidbank Corporation (now Metrobank) vs. Gateway Electronics Corporation, et al.* G.R. No. 164805, April 30, 2008.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision nullifying RTC Orders related to a Motion for Production and Inspection of Documents.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Gateway obtained four USD-denominated loans from Solidbank in 1997, secured by promissory notes with stated interest and penalties. The loans were to be used for working capital.
*   **Assignment of Proceeds:** Two of the loans (PN 97-375 & PN 97-408) were secured by an assignment of proceeds from Gateway's "Back-end Services Agreement" with Alliance Semiconductor Corporation.  Gateway was obligated to remit payments received from Alliance directly to Solidbank.  The PNs include clauses indicating that the assignment is to the *extent necessary* to cover amounts due.
*   **Default & Collection Suit:** Gateway defaulted on the loans. Solidbank filed a collection suit and subsequently amended the complaint to include Gateway's officers as sureties based on a Continuing Guaranty agreement.
*   **Motion for Production:** Solidbank filed a Motion for Production and Inspection of Documents seeking all documents related to the Back-end Services Agreement, alleging information from Alliance's CFO suggesting payments were made to Gateway. This motion was granted by the RTC.
*   **Non-Compliance & Contempt:** Gateway produced some invoices but Solidbank deemed it insufficient. Solidbank sought to cite Gateway for contempt. The RTC denied the contempt motion but ordered that the matters concerning the unproduced documents would be considered established in accordance with Solidbank's claims under Rule 29, Sec 3(a).
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals nullified the RTC Orders, holding that Solidbank's Motion for Production failed to comply with Section 1, Rule 27 of the Rules of Court (lack of specificity). The CA held the RTC abused its discretion in deeming the unproduced documents to establish Solidbank's claims.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether Solidbank's Motion for Production and Inspection of Documents, and the RTC's order granting it, complied with Rule 27, Section 1.
2.  Whether the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in deeming matters established under Rule 29, Section 3(a) due to non-production of documents.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision denying Solidbank's petition.
*   **Defective Motion:** The Court found Solidbank's motion for production and inspection was fatally defective because it lacked specificity.  The request for "all documents pertaining to, arising from, in connection with or involving the Back-end Services Agreement" was deemed too broad. Referencing *Security Bank Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 135874, January 25, 2000, 323 SCRA 330).
*   **Abuse of Discretion:** The RTC abused its discretion in applying Rule 29, Section 3(a) because Gateway could not be penalized for failing to produce documents that were not specifically described. There was an effort of good faith production of documents.

**Obligations:**

*   **Gateway:** Obligated to repay the loans per the promissory notes. Has a duty to remit proceeds from the Alliance agreement to Solidbank pursuant to the assignment.
*   **Solidbank:** Obligated to follow the Rules of Court regarding discovery procedures.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Gateway:** Potentially liable for the unpaid loan amounts, interest, and penalties, *subject to proof*.  Their officers may be held liable as sureties under the Continuing Guaranty, *subject to proof*.
*   **Solidbank:** Risked further delaying and complicating its collection efforts due to the defective Motion for Production.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Specificity of Assigned Proceeds:** The assignment of proceeds is only "to the extent necessary" to satisfy amounts due. This phrasing could be a point of contention, requiring a precise accounting of what constitutes "necessary" to be remitted.
*   **Continuing Guaranty:** The enforceability of the Continuing Guaranty may be challenged based on the standard defenses to suretyship agreements (e.g., alteration of the principal obligation).
*   **Interest Rate:** The discrepancy between the stated interest rate of 8.75% in the promissory notes and the alleged increase to 10% raises issues of contractual modification and potential usury (if the interest and penalties combined exceed the legal limits, though this is a foreign currency loan).
*   **Burden of Proof:** The court reiterated that Solidbank bears the burden of proof regarding the proceeds received by Gateway.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 27, Section 1:** Motion for Production and Inspection of Documents.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 29, Section 3(a):** Consequences of Refusal to Obey Discovery Order.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 1**: Burden of Proof

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Security Bank Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 135874, January 25, 2000, 323 SCRA 330) â€“ Outlines requisites for compelling production of documents.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The breadth of documents listed in Solidbank's Motion for Production.
*   The phrase "to the extent necessary" in the assignment clauses of the Promissory Notes.
