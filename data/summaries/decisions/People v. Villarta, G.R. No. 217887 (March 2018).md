**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Villarta*, G.R. No. 217887 (2018)**

**Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Clover A. Villarta for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.  The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA and RTC decisions, acquitting Villarta.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Violations of Sections 5 and 11, Art. II of RA 9165 for selling 0.01 gram of *shabu* (Criminal Case No. CBU-88596) and possessing 0.03 gram of *shabu* (Criminal Case No. CBU-88597).
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Testimony of PO2 Bugtai, the poseur-buyer, regarding a buy-bust operation. Stipulations regarding the testimonies of SPO1 Petallar (backup) and the PNP Forensic Chemist. Exhibits included Coordination Form, Pre-Operational Report, buy-bust money, the *shabu*, a letter requesting laboratory examination, photographs, Inventory Receipt, blotter entry, and Chemistry Report.
*   **Defense Evidence:**  Villarta's testimony claiming he was set up and the drugs were planted. An identification card was presented.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Conviction based on substantial compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, proving chain of custody, and lack of ill motive for the police officers.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC, holding that the prosecution established the elements of both crimes and the chain of custody, excusing non-compliance with certain procedures due to justifiable grounds.
*   **SC Ruling:** Acquittal due to reasonable doubt. The Court found the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, especially concerning the initial marking of the drugs.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing the identity of the drugs and an unbroken chain of custody.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Break in Chain of Custody:** PO2 Bugtai admitted to marking the drugs *after* returning to the police station, not immediately at the scene, creating a significant break in the chain of custody. *People v. Ismael*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017
*   **Inventory and Photographing Non-Compliance:** The Inventory Receipt lacked required signatures (accused, media, DOJ) to verify presence. Testimonial evidence failed to establish proper photographic documentation of the evidence. *People v. Del Mundo*, G.R. No. 208095, September 20, 2017
*   **Inadequate Forensic Chemist Testimony:** The prosecution stipulated that the forensic chemist had no knowledge of the source of the drugs, weakening the connection between the seized substance and the exhibit in court. *People v. Havana*, G.R. No. 198450, January 13, 2016
*   **Section 21 RA 9165 Non-Compliance:** Failure to present an inventory and conduct photography in the presence of required witnesses at either the scene or the police station. *People v. Miranda, Jr.*, G.R. No. 206880, June 29, 2016
*   **Inadequate Justification for Non-Compliance**: The given justifications for failing to complete the tasks laid out in Section 21 were not considered reasonable for the prosecution's failure to comply with the required procedure laid out by RA 9165. *People v. Miranda, Jr.*, G.R. No. 206880, June 29, 2016

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 & 11:** Charges related to illegal sale and possession.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:**  Defines the procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs, including inventory and photographing requirements. Amended by RA 10640.
*   **Chain of Custody Jurisprudence:** Numerous cases, including *People v. Ismael*, *People v. Del Mundo*, *People v. Miranda, Jr.*, and *People v. Havana*, emphasize the importance of an unbroken chain of custody and the consequences of failing to comply with Section 21.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception in IRR of RA 9165:**  The CA relied on this exception to excuse the buy-bust team's non-compliance with Section 21, but the SC found the presented reasons (lack of marking pen, lack of a container, failure to contact Section 21 witnesses) insufficient. The prosecution also failed to authenticate their claim.
