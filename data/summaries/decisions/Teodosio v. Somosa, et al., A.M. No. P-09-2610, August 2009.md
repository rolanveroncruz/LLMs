## Legal Document Summary: *A.M. No. P-09-2610*

**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning grave misconduct by sheriffs in the execution of a writ.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation of Rule 39, Section 9 (Execution of Judgments for Money):**  Respondents failed to demand payment from the judgment debtor (Mary Ann Ng) before levying property.  They instead demanded payment from, and levied property belonging to, Nueva Swine, a separate legal entity not named in the writ, despite being informed the properties were not those of Mary Ann Ng.
*   **Grave Abuse of Authority:** Respondents forcibly took swine belonging to Nueva Swine, and even slaughtered one for consumption, demonstrating disregard for proper procedure and third-party property rights.
*   **Disregard of TRO:** Respondents were informed of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by the RTC, Barotac Viejo, but continued to transport the pigs.

**Obligations:** Sheriffs have a ministerial duty to execute writs with reasonable diligence according to their mandates, adhering strictly to Rule 39, Section 9. Specifically, demanding payment from the judgment obligor and levying only on their property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** The Court found the sheriffs guilty of grave abuse of authority amounting to grave misconduct.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of benefits, except accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to re-employment in any government branch or agency.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The appropriation of levied property (slaughtering the pig) could expose the sheriffs to criminal charges.
*   **Civil Action:**  Nueva Swine may have grounds for a civil action against the sheriffs for damages resulting from the illegal levy and property loss.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 9 of the Rules of Court:** The core statutory reference governing the proper procedure for executing money judgments. *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Balubar, Jr., A.M. No. P-04-1767* reinforces the importance of first demanding payment.
*   **Doctrine of Corporate Veil Piercing:** The court notes that while the corporate veil may be pierced in certain circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, the fact that Ng was President of Nueva Swine does not justify levying the corporation's assets for Ng's personal debt. *Aratea and Canonigo v. Suico and Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 170284*
*   **Ministerial Duty of Sheriffs:** Sheriffs are bound to execute valid writs according to their mandate. *Tropical Homes vs. Fortune* the execution can only affect person specifically stated.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Respondents' actions violated sections 2 and 6 requiring courteous conduct and expeditious enforcement within the limits of authority.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While respondents allege Dr. Donglal suggested slaughtering the pig for food, the Court found this unacceptable, highlighting the importance of maintaining custody of levied property. This is a crucial point of factual dispute.
*   The court questions whether the checks issued by accused Ng was authorized by the petitioner corporation, as well as the compromise agreement signed by Mary Ann Ng.
