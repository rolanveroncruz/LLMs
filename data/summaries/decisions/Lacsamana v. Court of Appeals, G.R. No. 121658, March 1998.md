## Legal Document Summary: Lacsamana vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 121658, March 27, 1998

**Nature:** Petition to review a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court ruling in favor of the Robles heirs, ordering reconveyance and cancellation of titles related to a property fraudulently transferred.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot No. 13535 in Lipa City, originally co-owned by Leon Robles and Amparo Robles, covered by OCT No. 0-363-R.
*   **Fraudulent Sale:** A 1971 Deed of Absolute Sale purportedly transferring Leon Robles' share to Nestor Lacsamana was deemed a forgery, as Leon Robles was deceased at the time.
*   **Subsequent Transfers:** The Robles share was subsequently transferred to LBJ Development Corporation, after a transfer to non-existent person Nestor Lacsamana.
*   **Ruling:** LBJ was not a buyer in good faith and the court ordered the cancellation of titles held by LBJ and reinstatement of the original title reflecting Leon Robles' and EL Dorado Plantation ownership. Reconveyance was ordered, failing which LBJ must pay the current market value of the Robles' share.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **LBJ Development Corporation:** Obligation to reconvey the Robles' share of the property.  If impossible, obligation to pay fair market value, determined by an appraiser. Liable jointly and severally with El Dorado Plantation, Inc., and Conrad Leviste for attorney's fees (P20,000) and costs of suit.
*   **El Dorado Plantation, Inc.:** Liable jointly and severally with LBJ Development Corporation and Conrad Leviste for attorney's fees and costs of suit.
*   **Conrad C. Leviste:** Liable jointly and severally with LBJ Development Corporation and El Dorado Plantation, Inc. for attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Determination of Fair Market Value:** Disagreement on the appraiser can lead to further litigation regarding the valuation of the property.
*   **Subsequent Transfers:** Any further transfers of the subdivided lots may complicate reconveyance and could lead to further disputes.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the judgment against LBJ for reconveyance or payment may require further legal action if LBJ resists.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1410, Civil Code of the Philippines:**  Action to declare nullity of a void contract does not prescribe.
*   **Yanas v. Acaylar, G.R. No. 54538, 25 April 1985, 136 SCRA 52, 56:** Actions for reconveyance based on a void contract are imprescriptible.
*   **Torrens System:**  The court found that the Torrens System does not apply when a party has actual knowledge of facts that would impel a reasonable person to inquire further.  *Santos v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 90380, 13 September 1990, 189 SCRA 550, 560.*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fair Market Value Determination:** Lack of clear guidelines on the appraisal process beyond agreement between parties.
*   **"Impossible" Reconveyance:** No specific criteria define when reconveyance is considered "impossible" due to subsequent transfers.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser (LBJ):** The core contention revolves around whether LBJ was a buyer in good faith. The court ultimately found LBJ was not because there were several details surrounding the transaction that should have prompted the need for more information regarding Nestor Lacsamana and the land title in question.
