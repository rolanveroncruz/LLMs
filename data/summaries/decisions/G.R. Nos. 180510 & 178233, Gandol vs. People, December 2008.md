Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, focusing on key aspects:

**Case Name:** *Joseph A. Gandol vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 178233) and *People of the Philippines vs. Eduardo Gandol y Albor* (G.R. No. 180510)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** December 4, 2008

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Joseph and Eduardo Gandol for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:**

*   Ricardo Asejo, Jr. was stabbed to death. Joseph and Eduardo Gandol, along with Nestor Ocaña, were initially charged.
*   Nestor Ocaña was discharged as an accused to become a state witness.
*   Nestor testified that Joseph and Eduardo, acting in conspiracy, stabbed Ricardo. He saw Joseph stab Ricardo in the back, and Eduardo stabbed him in the front.
*   Medical evidence indicated multiple stab wounds to the victim's chest, back, and arm, and abrasions to the chest. The cause of death was asphyxia by drowning (after being dragged to a brook).
*   Joseph and Eduardo presented conflicting defenses, each blaming the other for the stabbing.
*   The RTC convicted both of murder. Joseph was initially sentenced to death, but the CA modified it to *reclusion perpetua* due to Republic Act No. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings regarding the credibility of state witness Nestor Ocaña. The court emphasized that factual findings of the trial court, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally binding unless there's a clear showing of overlooked facts of substance.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between Joseph and Eduardo.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The court affirmed the finding of treachery, noting that the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, coupled with the victim's unarmed status, prevented him from adequately defending himself. The presence of some "defense wounds" did not negate treachery. *See People v. Abrenica, 322 Phil. 53, 63 (1996); Soplente v. People, G.R. No. 152715, 29 July 2005, 465 SCRA 267, 285-286.*
*   **Aggravating Circumstance of Relationship:** The Court ruled that the aggravating circumstance of relationship could not be considered because it was not specifically alleged in the Amended Information, as required by the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure.  *See People v. Demate, 465 Phil. 127, 147 (2004)*
*   **Mitigating Circumstance of Voluntary Surrender:** The Court considered the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in favor of Eduardo, leading to the imposition of the minimum penalty for murder *reclusion perpetua.*
*   **Penalties & Damages:**
    *   Both Joseph and Eduardo were sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
    *   Solidary liability for:
        *   ₱50,000.00 as civil indemnity (consistent with prevailing jurisprudence).
        *   ₱50,000.00 as moral damages (consistent with prevailing jurisprudence).
        *   ₱25,000.00 as exemplary damages (due to the presence of treachery). *Article 2230 of the New Civil Code*
        *   ₱25,000.00 as temperate damages (in lieu of proven actual damages below ₱25,000.00, specifically funeral expenses of ₱5,200.00).
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 248 (Murder) and Article 63 (Rules for Application of Indivisible Penalties)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on State Witness:** The conviction relies heavily on the testimony of a former accused turned state witness. Defense counsel could argue potential bias or self-serving motives on the part of Nestor Ocaña, despite the court's finding of credibility.
*   **Corroboration:** Eduardo initially argued that the testimony of Nestor is not completely corroborated by the medico-legal report since according to Dr. Kapuno the stab wounds of the victim were caused by only one instrument. The Court ruled that what the physician simply meant was that only one kind of instrument or knife was used to wound the victim.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision cites several cases related to witness credibility, the elements of treachery, and the retroactive application of procedural rules.  Some key cases cited include:
    *   *People v. Matito, 468 Phil. 14, 24-25 (2004).*
    *   *People v. Castillo, G.R. No. 118912, 28 May 2004, 430 SCRA 40, 50.*
    *   *People v. Waggay, G.R. No. 98154, 9 February 1993, 218 SCRA 742-753-754; People v. Caballes, G.R. Nos. 93437-45, 12 July 1991, 199 SCRA 152, 167.*
    *   *People v. Belaro, 367 Phil. 90, 107 (1999).*
    *   *People v. Lopez, G.R. No. 112448, 30 October 1995, 249 SCRA 610, 625-626.*
    *   *People v. Aguila, G.R. No. 171017, 6 December 2006, 510 SCRA 642, 663.*
    *   *People v. Dela Cruz, 459 Phil. 130, 138-139 (2003).*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for Murder, finding sufficient evidence of conspiracy and treachery. While the aggravating circumstance of relationship was not considered due to procedural defects in the Information, one defendant benefited from the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. The case clarifies the application of treachery, the evaluation of state witness testimony, and the proper awards for damages in murder cases.
