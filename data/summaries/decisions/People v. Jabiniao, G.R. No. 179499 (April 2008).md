**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Toribio Jabiniao, Jr.* G.R. No. 179499, April 30, 2008.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Toribio Jabiniao, Jr. guilty of Robbery with Homicide under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 7659.  The RTC originally sentenced Jabiniao to death, but this was reduced to reclusion perpetua due to R.A. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty). The charges stem from an incident on August 27, 1998, where Jabiniao and an unidentified accomplice robbed the Pasilang residence, resulting in the death of Ruben Pasilang.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294, RPC):** The court upheld the conviction for robbery with homicide, noting that the killing occurred "by reason or on occasion of the robbery" to facilitate escape and eliminate witnesses. *People v. Hernandez* G.R. No. 139697 and *People v. de Jesus* G.R. No. 134815 are referenced to support the elements of this crime.
*   **Positive Identification:** The court relied heavily on the positive identification of Jabiniao by the victim's wife, Maria Divina Pasilang.  Her testimony was deemed credible and consistent, surviving cross-examination.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The court affirmed the presence of aggravating circumstances: (1) use of an unlicensed firearm; (2) commission of the crime in the dwelling; and (3) treachery.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** The court modified and clarified the awards for damages:
    *   Civil Indemnity: Php 75,000.00 (mandatory due to the commission of the crime). *Mendoza v. People* G.R. No. 173551,
    *   Moral Damages: Php 50,000.00.
    *   Exemplary Damages: Php 25,000.00 (due to the presence of aggravating circumstances) *Llave v. People* G.R. No. 166040
    *   Temperate Damages: Php 25,000.00 (in lieu of actual damages for funeral expenses). *People v. Garin* G.R. No. 139069
    *   Loss of Earning Capacity: Php 816,000.00 (calculated based on the victim's income and life expectancy). *People v. Laut* 403 Phil. 819
    *   Restitution: Php 2,000.00 (for the amount stolen).

**Obligations:**

*   Jabiniao is obligated to serve his sentence of reclusion perpetua.
*   Jabiniao is obligated to pay the heirs of Ruben Pasilang a total of P993,000.00 in various damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Robbery with Homicide under Art. 294 of the RPC.
*   Civil liability to the heirs of the victim for the amounts specified above.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification Question:** The defense challenged the credibility of the identification, arguing that Jabiniao would not have removed his mask. The court rejected this argument based on the lack of a "standard form of behavior" during a shocking incident.  This could be a point of contention if further appeals are pursued.
*   **Accidental vs. Intentional Killing:** The defense argued that the killing was separate from the robbery, but the court found that the shots were fired to facilitate escape and eliminate witnesses.
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity Calculation:** The calculation of the loss of earning capacity is based on estimates and the formula used by the court and could be disputed.
*   **Rolando Jabiniao's inconsistent testimony.** Rolando stated that Toribio was in his house on the evening of August 26, 1998. This contradicted Toribio's alibi, and therefore hurt his case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294, Revised Penal Code:** Defines Robbery with Homicide.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amended Article 294 of the RPC
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
*   *People v. Hernandez, G.R. No. 139697*: Defining "by reason or on the occasion of the robbery."
*   *People v. de Jesus, G.R. No. 134815*: Defining "by reason or on the occasion of the robbery."
*   *People v. Segundo, 228 SCRA 691* No standard form of behavior
*   *Mendoza v. People* G.R. No. 173551, civil indemnity.
*   *Llave v. People* G.R. No. 166040 exemplary damages
*   *People v. Garin* G.R. No. 139069 temperate damages
*   *People v. Laut* 403 Phil. 819 loss of earning capacity calculation

**Conclusion:** The conviction and the imposed liabilities are well-supported by the facts and legal precedent. Further appeals would likely focus on the factual issues surrounding the identification and the intent behind the killing, but the Supreme Court's decision appears sound.
