**Case:** *Hedcor, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (G.R. No. 250313, July 22, 2024)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted Hedcor's petition for review on certiorari, reversing the CTA En Banc's denial of Hedcor's claim for VAT refund for the 3rd quarter of 2012. The SC held that the CTA erroneously applied Section 15(g) of RA 9513 (Renewable Energy Act of 2008) by concluding that Hedcor's purchases were automatically zero-rated, and thus, Hedcor filed the wrong remedy (refund under Sec. 112(A) NIRC). The SC ruled that for RE developers to avail of the incentives under RA 9513, they need a certification from the DOE. Since Hedcor did not have said certification for Q3 2012, RA 9513 does not apply to this case and therefore Hedcor's purchases in the third quarter of CY 2012 were not zero-rated, and were subject to 12% VAT. Thus, Hedcor correctly filed the administrative/judicial claim under Section 112(A) of the NIRC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 112(A) of the NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code):** Governs VAT refunds for zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales. Sets out requisites for claiming refund or TCC.
*   **Section 15(g) of RA 9513 (Renewable Energy Act of 2008):** Provides incentives for RE Developers, including zero-rated VAT on purchases. **SC clarifies a certification from the DOE is required to avail of this incentive.**
*   **Section 26 of RA 9513:** Requires certification from DOE's Renewable Energy Management Bureau to qualify for incentives.
*   **Obligation for RE Developers:** To obtain DOE certification to qualify for zero-rated VAT on purchases under RA 9513.
*   **Obligation to file VAT refund claim within 2 years after the close of the taxable quarter when sales were made**

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **CTA's Erroneous Application of RA 9513:** The CTA incorrectly applied RA 9513's zero-rating incentive automatically, without considering the requirement of DOE certification.
*   **Risk of Unjust Enrichment:** If VAT is mistakenly charged on zero-rated purchases, the supplier is unjustly enriched, not the government (based on *Coral Bay Nickel Corporation*).
*   **Risk of Incorrect Remedy:** Filing for refund under Section 112(A) when purchases are zero-rated, or vice versa, may result in denial of the claim.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** Taxpayer bears the burden of proving entitlement to VAT refund, including compliance with all requirements.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Coral Bay Nickel Corporation v. CIR*** (787 Phil. 57 (2016)):  Cited extensively. The supplier, not the buyer, is the proper party to claim VAT refund in cases of zero-rated sales erroneously subjected to VAT.
*   ***Contex Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*** (477 Phil. 442 (2004)): Affirmed that the proper party to claim the VAT refund is the supplier, not the taxpayer.
*   ***San Roque Power Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*** (620 Phil. 554, 574-575 (2009)): Sets out the requisites for VAT refund under Section 112(A) of the NIRC
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. CBK Power Company*** (C.T.A. EB Case No. 1861, October 25, 2019): Affirmed that RE developers must register with the DOE and secure certification from the Renewable Energy Management Bureau (REMB).

**Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) / Tax Code:** Section 112(A) – VAT Refunds.
*   **Republic Act No. 9513 (RA 9513):** Renewable Energy Act of 2008. Section 15 – Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects and Activities. Section 26 – Certification from the Department of Energy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Automatic vs. Conditional Applicability of RA 9513 Incentives:** CTA interpreted RA 9513 as automatically granting zero-rating upon effectivity. The SC clarified that DOE certification is a prerequisite to avail of the incentives.
*   **Application of _Solutio Indebiti_:** Hedcor argued that the principle of _solutio indebiti_ applies.  However, the court did not rule on the application of _solutio indebiti_ as the resolution of the case relies on whether or not Hedcor's purchases in the third quarter of CY 2012 are zero-rated.

**Outcome & Recommendation:**

The SC reversed the CTA En Banc decision and remanded CTA Case No. 8990 to the CTA Second Division to determine the amount of unutilized Input Value-Added Tax attributable to Hedcor, Inc.'s zero-rated and effectively zero-rated sales during the third quarter of Calendar Year 2012, and for the resolution of CTA Case No. 8990 on the merits, in accordance with this Decision, with dispatch.
