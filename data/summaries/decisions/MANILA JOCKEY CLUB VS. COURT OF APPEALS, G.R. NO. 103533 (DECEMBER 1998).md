**Case:** Manila Jockey Club, Inc. and Philippine Racing Club , Inc. vs. The Court of Appeals and Philippine Racing Commission, G.R. No. 103533, December 15, 1998.

**Summary:** This is a Petition for Review regarding the allocation of "breakages" (fractions of ten centavos eliminated from winning ticket dividends) generated from horse racing. Manila Jockey Club (MJCI) and Philippine Racing Club (PRCI) contest the Philippine Racing Commission's (PHILRACOM) claim to breakages derived from mid-week races (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 309 (1948):** Original law regulating horse racing; silent on breakages, leading to the practice by petitioners to use the "breakages" for anti-bookies and sales promotion.
*   **RA 6631 & RA 6632 (Franchise Laws):** Granted MJCI and PRCI franchises to operate race tracks, specifying racing days (Saturdays, Sundays, holidays). Initially allocated breakages to Provincial/City hospitals, drug rehabilitation, Philippine Amateur Athletes Federation (PAAF), and charitable institutions.
*   **PD 420 (1974):** Created PHILRACOM, giving it jurisdiction over horse racing, including race schedules. PHILRACOM authorized mid-week races.
*   **Executive Orders 88 & 89:** Amended RA 6631 & 6632, designating PHILRACOM as a beneficiary of the breakages, replacing PAAF.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Franchise laws (RA 6631 & RA 6632) limit the breakage allocation scheme to races on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Mid-week races are outside this scope, so the breakages belong to the racing clubs.
*   **PHILRACOM's Argument:** The franchise grants are primary, and regulations like PD 420 and EO 88 & 89 apply to all races, including mid-week races, as these provisions are general in nature.

**Court's Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals decision. The distribution scheme of RA 6631 & 6632, as amended by EO 88 & 89, applies to *all* races, including mid-week races authorized by PHILRACOM. MJCI and PRCI must remit the corresponding share of breakages to PHILRACOM. The court rejected the argument to isolate each law from each other, it held that the existing laws are the governing rules over the petitioner's activities. The Court ruled the "breakages" for mid-week races from the time that PHILRACOM has authorized the holding of such races, should be remitted. It held, the petitioners had become the implied trustees for those legally entitled to the proceeds and should have set aside the amount for the defunct PAAF until an alternative beneficiary was designated, which, as provided for by Executive Order Nos. 88 and 89, is PHILRACOM.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Remit Breakages:** MJCI and PRCI are obligated to remit breakages from all races (including mid-week) to the beneficiaries stipulated in RA 6631 & 6632, as amended by EO 88 & 89.
*   **Retroactive Liability:** MJCI and PRCI are retroactively liable to PHILRACOM for its share of breakages from mid-week races, starting from the time PHILRACOM authorized such races.
*   **Trustee Liability:** MJCI and PRCI are considered implied trustees for amounts that should have been allocated to PAAF (now PHILRACOM) and cannot retroactively claim ownership.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Actions:** PHILRACOM may pursue enforcement actions (legal suits, penalties, revocation of permits) to recover unpaid breakages.
*   **Continued Litigation:** MJCI and PRCI may attempt further appeals, though the Supreme Court decision is highly persuasive.
*   **Public Scrutiny:** The case highlights the gambling nature of horse racing and the potential for exploitation, increasing public scrutiny.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 309:** Original Horse Racing Law
*   **PD 420:** Created PHILRACOM
*   **RA 6631 & RA 6632:** Franchise Laws for MJCI & PRCI
*   **Executive Orders 88 & 89:** Amended allocation of breakages.
*   **Civil Code Article 1456:** Implied Trust (basis for liability regarding PAAF share).
*   **RCPI vs. NTC, 150 SCRA 450 (1987); PLDT vs. Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, 213 SCRA 16 (1992); Alger Electric Inc. vs. CA, 135 SCRA 37 (1985):** Discusses franchise laws as privileges conferred by the government.
*   **Lim vs. Pacquing, 240 SCRA 649 (1995):** Gambling franchise is subject to police power.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of whether franchise laws specifically apply to racing days enumerated under Sec. 5 of R.A. 6631 and Sec. 7 of R.A. 6632 or whether the regulations can generally be applied to races on any day.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court sided with PHILRACOM, emphasizing that the distribution scheme for breakages applies to all races, regardless of the day they are held. The key takeaway is that the franchise is a privilege subject to regulatory amendments, and erroneous application of the law by public officers does not prevent a subsequent correct application of the law.
