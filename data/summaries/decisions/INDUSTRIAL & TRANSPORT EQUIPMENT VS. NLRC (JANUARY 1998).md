## Legal Document Summary: Industrial and Transport Equipment, Inc. vs. NLRC & Medrano (G.R. No. 113592)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming a NLRC decision which found petitioner guilty of indirect contempt and ordering reinstatement and backwages (modified on appeal).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Reinstatement Order:** Labor Arbiter ordered INTECO to reinstate Medrano to his former position (without backwages in the original order). This became final and executory due to INTECO's failure to appeal.
*   **Indirect Contempt:** INTECO was cited for indirect contempt for failure to comply with the reinstatement order. NLRC affirmed this finding.
*   **Backwages:** Labor Arbiter ordered backwages from July 11, 1991, until actual reinstatement, *despite* the original order explicitly omitting backwages. The Supreme Court deleted the award of backwages on appeal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **INTECO:** Initially obligated to reinstate Medrano. Found liable for indirect contempt for non-compliance. Ultimately, the Court deleted the obligation to pay backwages, but the obligation to reinstate remains.
*   **Medrano:** Obligated to accept reinstatement.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Contempt Ruling:** INTECO's potential ongoing liability for contempt, dependent on actual compliance with the reinstatement order.
*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** The original decision became final despite the alleged error in omitting backwages. The Court cited *Asuncion v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 109311) and *Aboitiz Shipping Employees Association v. Trajano* (G.R. No. 112955) upholding the immutability of final judgments, preventing correction even of perceived errors of law or fact.
*   **Date of Reinstatement:** INTECO claimed reinstatement occurred *before* receiving the order, a claim the Court deemed implausible, creating a factual dispute critical to the contempt finding.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court:** Defines indirect contempt, particularly disobedience to a lawful court order.
*   **Section 2, Rule X of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC:**  Outlines the process for citing indirect contempt within the NLRC.
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code (as amended):** Entitlement of illegally dismissed employees to reinstatement and backwages.  *Notably*, this provision contradicts the original Labor Arbiter decision *denying* backwages, which became final.
*   **Asuncion v. NLRC**  (G.R. No. 109311, June 17, 1997): Jurisprudence regarding the finality of judgments and the jurisdictional nature of timely appeals.
*   **Aboitiz Shipping Employees Association v. Trajano**  (G.R. No. 112955, September 1, 1997): Jurisprudence affirming the immutability of final and executory judgments.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original Labor Arbiter decision *explicitly denying backwages* despite a finding of illegal dismissal directly contradicts Article 279 of the Labor Code. However, the respondent's failure to appeal this omission rendered the judgment final.

**Conclusion:**

The decision primarily concerns the finality of a labor arbiter's decision and the enforcement of a reinstatement order. Key risks for INTECO involve potential ongoing liability for contempt if reinstatement is not demonstrably and unambiguously fulfilled. The case highlights the strict application of the rules on finality of judgments, even when the original judgment appears to be legally deficient. The award of backwages on appeal was an error since the original judgment denied backwages, and the employer did not appeal this denial.
