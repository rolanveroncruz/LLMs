## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Perez*, G.R. No. 122764 (1998)

**Case Summary:** This is an automatic review of a death penalty conviction by the RTC for rape. The accused, Ernesto Perez, was found guilty of raping his 13-year-old stepdaughter, Maribel Perez. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Facts:** Perez brought Maribel to Samar and raped her in the Nieva's house. Maribel reported the crime, and a medical examination revealed a fresh hymenal laceration. Perez denied the charge, claiming he slept on the terrace with other children and that Maribel accused him because she found him beside her in the morning.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of rape with the qualifying circumstance of the victim being under 18 and the offender being the stepparent, warranting the death penalty. The court awarded P50,000 as moral damages.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction but *modified* the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* because the information only charged simple rape.

**Obligations:**

*   Perez is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Perez is obligated to pay Maribel P50,000 in actual/compensatory damages and an additional P50,000 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Civil liability for damages resulting from the crime (actual/compensatory and moral damages).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Defective Information:** The primary issue is the defective information which failed to allege the victim's age, a necessary element to qualify the offense under Republic Act No. 7659, to warrant the death penalty.
*   **Abuse of Confidence:** While mentioned, the Court found that the abuse of confidence was not shown to facilitate the rape and therefore could not serve as an aggravating circumstance.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Introduced new special circumstances of rape calling for the death penalty, including the victim being under 18 and the offender being the stepparent.
*   **People vs. Garcia:** Reinforces the principle that an accused cannot be convicted of a qualified offense if the qualifying circumstance is not alleged in the information.
*   **U.S. vs. De Guzman:** Reinforces the principle that an accused can only be convicted of the crime in which he is charged in, or an crime necessarily in included in that charge.
*   **People vs. Prades:** Dispensed with the need to prove mental and physical suffering to warrant an award for moral damages in rape cases.
*   **People vs. Gementiza:** Categorizes the mandatory P50,000 award in rape cases as actual or compensatory damages.
*   **People vs. Victor:** Establishes increased indemnity for victims of rape cases punishable by death.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of whether the failure to include the victim's age in the information, despite the accused knowing the fact, constituted a denial of due process.
*   The potential use of grave abuse of confidence as an aggravating circumstance.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court correctly modified the penalty due to the prosecution's failure to properly allege all the elements of the qualified offense in the information. This highlights the importance of precise pleading in criminal cases to ensure due process.
