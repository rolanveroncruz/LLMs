**Case:** *Ramon E. Reyes and Clara R. Pastor vs. Bancom Development Corp.* (G.R. No. 190286, January 11, 2018)

**Summary:**

This case concerns the liability of Ramon E. Reyes and Clara R. Pastor (Petitioners) as guarantors of loans obtained by Marbella Realty, Inc. (Marbella) from Bancom Development Corp. (Respondent/Bancom). The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling holding Petitioners jointly and severally liable to Bancom based on a Continuing Guaranty.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Continuing Guaranty:** Petitioners, along with others (the Reyes Group), executed a Continuing Guaranty in favor of Bancom, guaranteeing Marbella's obligations under an Underwriting Agreement, specifically Promissory Notes issued by Marbella.
*   **Marbella's Default:** Marbella repeatedly defaulted on these Promissory Notes, which were replaced multiple times with increasing amounts due to accrued interest and penalties.
*   **Bancom's Suit:** Bancom filed a Complaint for Sum of Money against Marbella (as principal debtor) and the Reyes Group (as guarantors) seeking payment.
*   **Defense:** Petitioners argued coercion in the execution of the Promissory Notes and Continuing Guaranty, and that the instruments should be interpreted in relation to prior agreements concerning the Marbella II condominium project involving Bancom and Fereit Realty Development Corporation (Fereit). They claimed Bancom took advantage of their financial distress due to Fereit's failure to fulfill its obligations.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC held Marbella and the Reyes Group solidarily liable. The CA affirmed, finding the genuineness and due execution of the Promissory Notes and Continuing Guaranty undisputed, and rejecting the defense based on earlier agreements, noting the clarity of the promissory notes and Continuing Guaranty.
*   **Bancom's Corporate Dissolution:** During the CA proceedings, Bancom's counsel withdrew due to loss of contact with the client and reports of a merger. Petitioners argued before the CA (and again before the Supreme Court) that the suit abated because Bancom's Certificate of Registration had been revoked by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Issues & Supreme Court Ruling:**

1.  **Abatement of Suit:** Did the revocation of Bancom's Certificate of Registration by the SEC abate the proceedings?
    *   **Ruling:** No. While Section 122 of the Corporation Code limits a dissolved corporation's existence to three years for winding up, jurisprudence allows a receiver, assignee, or trustee to continue suits. The Court held that even without a formal appointment, the directors of a dissolved corporation are considered trustees by legal implication. Section 145 of the Corporation Code states that no right or remedy in favor of or against a corporation shall be impaired by subsequent dissolution.
2.  **Petitioners' Liability:** Did the CA correctly rule that Petitioners are liable to Bancom for the loan amounts and attorney's fees?
    *   **Ruling:** Yes, with modification. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding that Petitioners are solidarily liable with Marbella based on the Continuing Guaranty. The Court rejected the argument that the Promissory Notes were not binding due to alleged additional financing. The Court found the terms of the Promissory Notes and Continuing Guaranty to be plain and unqualified. The amounts of the Promissory Notes were not paid on their maturity dates as indicated on the instrument. Petitioners did not challenge the genuineness and due execution of the promissory notes. The Court modified the interest rate to conform to legal interest rates under prevailing jurisprudence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Petitioners are jointly and severally liable with Marbella for the outstanding debt to Bancom.
*   **Monetary Award:** Petitioners were ordered to pay:
    *   P4,300,247.35 (principal, interest, and penalties as of May 19, 1981)
    *   Legal interest on the principal of P3,002,333.84 from May 19, 1981, until fully paid (12% until June 30, 2013, and 6% thereafter)
    *   Penalties equivalent to 20% of the obligation
    *   Legal interest on the penalty amount from May 19, 1981, until fully paid (12% until June 30, 2013, and 6% thereafter)
    *   Attorney's fees of P500,000
    *   Legal interest of 6% per annum on all foregoing monetary awards from date of finality of decision until full payment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code:** Sections 122 and 145 (relating to corporate liquidation and the preservation of rights and remedies despite dissolution).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** Petitioners are exposed to the risk of being held liable for the entire debt even if other guarantors are unable to contribute.
*   **Accruing Interest:** Interest continues to accrue on the principal amount, increasing the overall debt.
*   **Enforcement:** Bancom, or its trustees, have the legal right to enforce the judgment against Petitioners.
*   **The revocation of Bancom's Certificate of Registration by the SEC would have made the corporation defunct, however, the Supreme Court, citing jurisprudence, stated that a receiver, assignee, or trustee to continue suits can be a remedy. The Court held that even without a formal appointment, the directors of a dissolved corporation are considered trustees by legal implication.**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Additional Financing":** Petitioners' argument hinges on the interpretation of the funds released to Marbella as "additional financing" rather than a straightforward loan. However, the Court rejected this argument, citing the clear and unconditional terms of the Promissory Notes and Continuing Guaranty.

This summary provides a concise, legally precise overview of the key aspects of the case. Further investigation into the specific details of the underlying agreements and the current status of Bancom's corporate dissolution may be warranted.
