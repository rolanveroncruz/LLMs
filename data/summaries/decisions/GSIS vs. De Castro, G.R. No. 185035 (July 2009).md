**Case Summary: _Government Service Insurance System v. Salvador A. De Castro_ (G.R. No. 185035, July 15, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the GSIS and ECC's denial of permanent total disability benefits to Respondent De Castro.

**Facts:** De Castro, a retired PAF member, filed a claim for disability benefits with GSIS due to CAD and Hypertensive Cardiovascular Disease, diagnosed during his service. GSIS denied, claiming the conditions were non-occupational. ECC affirmed the denial, acknowledging CAD as an occupational disease but citing De Castro's smoking and alcohol consumption as primary causes. The CA reversed, holding the illnesses were listed as occupational diseases, rendering proof of causal relation unnecessary, citing _GSIS v. Baul_. The GSIS appealed, arguing that the conditions specified in Annex "A" of the Amended ECC Rules for heart diseases must be met, and De Castro failed to prove the requisite work-related strain or causal connection, citing _GSIS v. CA_.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **GSIS Argument:**  CAD and hypertensive cardiovascular disease are not inherent occupational hazards and are non-compensable due to De Castro's lifestyle choices (smoking and drinking). Relies on specific conditions in Amended ECC Rules, Annex "A", No. 18 requiring proof of unusual work strain or causal connection (_GSIS v. CA_ reinforces separation of AFP and Compensation proceedings).

*   **De Castro Argument:**  CAD and hypertensive cardiovascular disease are listed as occupational diseases, relieving him of proving direct causation (_Dominga A. Salmone v. ECC_). He argues stress from his military duties contributed. Points to his Certificate of Disability Discharge stating his illnesses were aggravated during active service. Contends that the conditions laid down under Item No. 18 of Annex "A" of the Amended ECC Rules, are alternative.

*   **Amended ECC Rules:** Annex "A" lists CAD and essential hypertension as occupational diseases, but Item 18 specifies conditions for heart disease claims, related to work-induced strain.

**Court's Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIED the GSIS petition, AFFIRMING the CA decision granting disability benefits to De Castro.

**Rationale:**

*   **Question of Law:**  The Court held the issue was a question of law, concerning the validity of conclusions drawn from the facts regarding compensability.

*   **Occupational Disease Listing:** Undisputed that De Castro's conditions are listed as occupational diseases.

*   **Rejection of Sole Causation:** The Court rejected the GSIS and ECC's sole reliance on smoking and alcohol consumption, emphasizing the need to consider other factors related to the nature of military service, including stress and physical demands.

*   **Certificate of Disability Discharge:** The Court gave weight to the AFP's Disability Certification, indicating aggravation and incidence during service, finding it should not be ignored.

*   **Reasonable Work Connection:** Stressed that the law only requires a "reasonable work connection" and not direct causal relation.

*   **Liberal Construction:** Reaffirmed the principle of liberal construction of labor laws in favor of the employee.

**Legal Issues and Potential Risks:**

*   **Causation Standard:** Whether the mere listing of a disease as "occupational" eliminates the need to prove causation, or whether specific criteria for certain listed conditions (like heart disease) must be met. The decision leans towards a lower threshold of "reasonable work connection," emphasizing the totality of circumstances.

*   **Weight of Military Findings:** The case highlights the tension between the expertise and authority of GSIS/ECC and the findings of other government agencies (here, the AFP). Over-reliance on the opinions of GSIS/ECC may not always be appropriate.

*   **Impact of Personal Habits:** The case clarifies that while lifestyle factors like smoking and drinking can contribute to illnesses, they should not be the sole determining factor in denying compensation, particularly when the disease is listed as occupational.

*   **Ambiguity in ECC Rules:** The interpretation of Annex "A" of Amended ECC Rules, particularly No. 18, remains potentially contentious. The court did not directly address De Castro's argument that the conditions listed are alternative.

*   **Potential for Broad Interpretation:** The emphasis on "reasonable work connection" and consideration of the totality of circumstances could lead to broader interpretations of compensability, potentially increasing the number of successful claims.

**Case Law References:**

*   _GSIS v. Baul:_ Cited by the CA for the principle that a covered claimant with an occupational disease is automatically paid benefits.
*   _Dominga A. Salmone v. ECC:_ Cited by De Castro for the argument that causal relation is not essential if the illness is an occupational disease.
*   _GSIS v. CA:_ Cited by the GSIS to emphasize the separation of AFP and compensation proceedings.
