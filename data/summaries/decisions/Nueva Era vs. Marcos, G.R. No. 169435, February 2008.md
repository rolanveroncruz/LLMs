## Legal Document Summary - *Municipality of Nueva Era v. Municipality of Marcos* (G.R. No. 169435)

**Case Overview:** This case involves a boundary dispute between the Municipalities of Nueva Era and Marcos in Ilocos Norte. The central issue is the interpretation of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3753, which created the Municipality of Marcos, specifically Section 1 regarding Marcos' eastern boundary as "the Ilocos Norte-Mt. Province boundary." Marcos claims this extends its territory into Nueva Era.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **R.A. No. 3753, Sec. 1:** Creates Marcos from specified barrios of Dingras, Ilocos Norte.
*   **Marcos' Argument:** The phrase "on the East, by the Ilocos Norte-Mt. Province boundary" in R.A. 3753, Sec. 1, means its eastern boundary extends to the present Ilocos Norte-Apayao boundary (formerly Mt. Province), thus encompassing a portion of Nueva Era's territory. Marcos claims the middle and isolated northern portions of Nueva Era, cutting the other municipality in two.
*   **Nueva Era's Argument:** Marcos was created *solely* from Dingras territory. Since R.A. 3753 lists specific Dingras barrios, any territory outside those barrios is excluded. Applying the maxim *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, Nueva Era's territory is not included.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) of Ilocos Norte:** Ruled in favor of Nueva Era, dismissing Marcos' claim, stating none of Nueva Era was included in the creation of Marcos.
*   **Regional Trial Court (RTC):** Affirmed the SP's decision, emphasizing the legislative intent (based on the Congressman's explanatory note during the creation of Marcos) was that Marcos be created from the barrios of Dingras only.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** *Partially* reversed the RTC. The CA agreed with the petition. The CA stated Marcos eastern boundary was not coterminous with the eastern boundary of Dingras town, and another is rendered extending the said boundary of Marcos to the boundary line between the province of Ilocos Norte and Kalinga-Apayao, but the same Decisions are AFFIRMED with respect to the denial of the claim of Marcos to the detached northern portion of barangay Sto. Ni√±o which should, as it is hereby ordered to, remain with the municipality of Nueva Era.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC decision.**
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   The Court focused on the intent of the law, finding it unambiguous that Marcos was to be created solely from territory of Dingras.
    *   The inclusion of certain barrios implies the exclusion of all others.
    *   The law must be interpreted so as not to lead to absurdity.
    *   No part of Nueva Era's territory was taken by the creation of Marcos.
    *   The Court cited *Casus omissus pro omisso habendus est*, meaning if a person, object, or thing is omitted from the enumeration, it must be held to have been omitted intentionally.
    *   The CA's interpretation of the boundaries was rejected. The Court instead favoured the legislative intent.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in R.A. 3753, Sec. 1:** The phrase "on the East, by the Ilocos Norte-Mt. Province boundary" created ambiguity, allowing Marcos to argue for an expanded territory. This highlights the risk of unclear boundary descriptions in legislative acts.
*   **Reliance on Legislative Intent:** The Supreme Court heavily relied on the legislative intent of the creation of Marcos. While often useful, the Court's reliance on the Congressman's Explanatory Note can be challenged as limited evidence of collective legislative intent.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3753:** An Act Creating the Municipality of Marcos in the Province of Ilocos Norte.
*   **R.A. No. 4695:** Which divided Mountain Province into Benguet, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Kalinga and Apayao.
*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Section 119 pertains to appealing the sanggunian's decision to the Regional Trial Court.

**Relevant Case Law Cited:**

*   *Municipality of Jimenez v. Baz* (333 Phil. 1, 18 (1996))
*   *Miranda v. Aguirre* (373 Phil. 386 (1999))
*   *Ceniza v. Commission on Elections* (G.R. No. L-52304, January 28, 1980, 95 SCRA 763)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision ultimately hinged on interpreting R.A. 3753 in line with the apparent intent of the legislature to create Marcos solely from Dingras territory. This case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of clear and unambiguous language in legislation, particularly when defining territorial boundaries, and the challenges of litigating disputes arising from ambiguous statutory language decades after enactment.
