Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Conrado Quesada, et al. vs. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. No. 177516, March 13, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the RTC's decision to revive a prior forcible entry judgment and award damages.

**Key Facts:**

*   **Original Dispute:** Querubin Derequito (predecessor of Respondents) encroached on a portion of land (Lot 225-B) owned by Epitacio Asuncion (predecessor of Petitioners) that was leased to Claro San Luis.
*   **Forcible Entry Case (Civil Case No. 8863):** San Luis (as defendant) won against Querubin Derequito. Judgment was rendered August 25, 1975, ordering Querubin to relinquish possession. Motion for reconsideration was denied Sept 15, 1976, making it final and executory
*   **Non-Enforcement:** The writ of execution for the forcible entry case was never implemented within 5 years.
*   **Expiration of Lease:** San Luis' lease expired in 1977, and the Quesadas assumed his rights.
*   **Action to Revive Judgment and Recover Possession (Civil Case No. 16681):** Filed by San Luis and Petitioners in 1985 to revive the 1975 judgment and seek damages and possession.
*   **RTC Decision:** Ruled in favor of Petitioners, reviving the 1975 judgment and awarding damages from 1977, attorney's fees, and ordering the return of the encroached land.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the RTC, holding that the action to revive the judgment had prescribed because more than 30 years had passed since the 1975 judgment became final.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Revival of Judgment:**  The core issue is whether the action to revive the 1975 forcible entry judgment (and obtain its enforcement) had prescribed.
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded damages for unlawful possession from 1977, when the San Luis' lease expired.

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC held the Respondents jointly and severally liable for damages (P40,000/year from 1977), attorney's fees (P20,000/trial), and litigation expenses.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prescription:** The Court of Appeals incorrectly computed the prescriptive period for reviving the judgment. The Supreme Court ruled the action was filed within the 10-year prescriptive period under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, which dictates that an action based on a judgment must be commenced within ten years. The court cited Article 1152, noting that prescription commences once the judgment becomes final.
*   **Modification of Judgment:** Respondents argued the RTC "modified" the 1975 judgment by awarding damages, which were not included in the original judgment. The Supreme Court explained that the award of damages was based on a separate cause of action for unlawful possession *after* the lease expired, not a modification of the revived judgment itself. The Supreme Court reasoned that the relief depended on the content of the judgment, not what was granted in the judgment sought to be revived.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1144:** Statute of limitations for actions based on judgments (10 years).
*   **Civil Code, Article 1152:** Prescription for judgments commences once the judgment becomes final.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Section 1:** Requirements for Certiorari.
*   **Manaya v. Alabang Country Club, Incorporated, G.R. No. 168988, June 19, 2007:** Notice to counsel is notice to client.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Pamintuan Development Co., G.R. No. 167886, October 25, 2005:** Presumption in favor of counsel's authority.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals' decision and **reinstated** the RTC's decision. The Court found that (1) the CA erred procedurally by allowing certiorari despite Respondents' failure to perfect their appeal; (2) the action to revive the judgment had not prescribed; and (3) the RTC's award of damages was not an improper modification of the original judgment but based on a separate cause of action.

**Potential Issues Moving Forward:**

*   Enforcement of the revived judgment and the award of damages. There may be challenges in locating assets and/or compelling compliance with the order to return the property. The calculation of damages since 1977 could also be a point of contention.
