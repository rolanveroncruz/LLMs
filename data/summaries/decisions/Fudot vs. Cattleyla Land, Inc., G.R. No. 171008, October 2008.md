**Legal Document Summary: *Fudot v. Cattleya Land, Inc.***

**Case:** *Carmelita Fudot v. Cattleya Land, Inc.* (G.R. No. 171008, October 24, 2008)

**Nature:** Resolution on indirect contempt charge against Atty. Victor De La Serna.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   Atty. De La Serna filed a request for inhibition of Justice Tinga, alleging bribery (P10 Million) based on statements made by Mr. Johnny Chan.
*   Atty. De La Serna claimed the decision in *Fudot v. Cattleya Land, Inc.* was inconsistent with Justice Tinga's prior ruling in *Lim v. Jorge* (G.R. No. 161861, March 11, 2005), implying bribery.
*   The Court initiated *motu proprio* indirect contempt proceedings against Atty. De La Serna.
*   Atty. De La Serna argued his statements were in good faith to prevent injustice.
*   Mr. Chan denied bribing Justice Tinga or any other Justice of the panel
*   The Court found Atty. De La Serna guilty of indirect contempt.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. De La Serna:** Fined P30,000.00 for indirect contempt. Duty as an officer of the court to uphold its dignity and authority, support the courts against unjust criticism, and refrain from conduct that brings the administration of law into disrepute.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reputation Damage:** The allegation of bribery impugned the integrity of Justice Tinga and the Supreme Court.
*   **Impact on Pending Case (A.C. No. 5763):** The IBP was ordered to expedite its report on the administrative case against Atty. De La Serna, potentially leading to further disciplinary action (Gabriel T. Ingles v. Atty. Victor De La Serna).
*   **Future Disciplinary Action:** The warning implies further similar conduct will result in a more severe penalty.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Sec. 4, Rules of Court:** Initiating indirect contempt proceedings *motu proprio*.
*   **Rule 71, Sec. 7, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Penalty for indirect contempt.
*   **Art. VIII, Section 15(1) of the Constitution:** Mandating decision timelines for cases.
*   ***Lim v. Jorge* (G.R. No. 161861, March 11, 2005):** Cited by Atty. De La Serna to argue inconsistency in Justice Tinga's rulings.
*   ***In re: Almacen*, 31 SCRA 562:** Right of lawyers to criticize courts in respectful terms.
*   ***In re: Wenceslao Laureta*, 148 SCRA 382:** Limits on collateral attacks on court resolutions.
* ***Abad v. Somera, 187 SCRA 75*, Contempt defined.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith" Argument:** Atty. De La Serna argued good faith. The Court rejected it because he didn't report bribery immediately.
*   **Advance Knowledge of Decision:** De La Serna implied Mr. Chan and Atty. Petralba's had advance knowledge but the Court rejected the claim.

**Key Takeaway:**

This case highlights the importance of balancing a lawyer's right to criticize the court with their duty to maintain its integrity and avoid baseless allegations of misconduct. Atty. De La Serna's contempt conviction underscores the potential consequences of making serious accusations without sufficient evidence.
