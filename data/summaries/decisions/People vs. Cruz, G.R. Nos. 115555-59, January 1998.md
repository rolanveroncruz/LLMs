## Legal Document Summary - People v. Villanueva, G.R. Nos. 115555-59

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. PFC. Wilfredo Villanueva and Pat. Herminigildo Cruz

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Decision:** Affirms the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision finding Accused-Appellant Herminigildo Cruz guilty of five counts of murder, qualified by treachery.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Five counts of murder arising from a shooting incident on May 30, 1989. Victims were killed by gunfire from a car.
*   **Accused:** Herminigildo Cruz (Appellant) and Wilfredo Villanueva, both policemen at the time of the incident. Villanueva escaped after arraignment and remains at large.
*   **Evidence:** Primarily the testimony of a single eyewitness, Julieto Sultero. Sultero identified Cruz as one of the assailants who alighted from the car, as well as the one who personally shot one of the victims (Sacil) at close range after the first burst of gunfire.
*   **Defense:** Cruz presented no evidence, having escaped confinement and tried in absentia. His appeal focuses on attacking the credibility of the sole eyewitness.
*   **Trial Court Finding:** Guilty of five counts of murder, qualified by treachery. Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count and ordered to indemnify the families of the victims.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Cruz is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of murder.
*   Cruz is liable to pay indemnity to each of the victims' families in the amount of P50,000.00

**Potential Risks:**

*   Reliance on a single eyewitness can be problematic.
*   **Ambiguity:** The case hinges on whether Sultero's testimony is indeed "clear and convincing".

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Qualification of Murder:** Qualified by treachery (established by the suddenness of the attack, leaving the victims no opportunity to defend themselves).
*   **Sufficiency of Single Witness Testimony:** Cited *People v. de Roxas, 241 SCRA 369 (1995)* and *People v. Rayray, 241 SCRA 1 (1995)*, establishing that a single eyewitness testimony is sufficient for conviction if clear, straightforward, and credible.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** Addressed by citing *People v. Viente, 225 SCRA 361 (1993)* and *People v. Vi√±as, Sr. 245 SCRA 448 (1995)*, acknowledging the natural reluctance of witnesses to get involved in criminal cases and explaining that the delay is not necessarily indicative of untruthfulness.
*   **Flight as Implied Admission of Guilt:** Acknowledged through *People v. Narajos, 149 SCRA 99 (1987)*

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense challenges the credibility of Sultero, but its attacks are not found persuasive by the Court. However, the fact that a conviction rests solely on one witness's memory and perception always presents a potential weakness.
*   The defense is weak.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding the eyewitness testimony credible and the qualifying circumstance of treachery present. While the reliance on a single witness presents a potential point of vulnerability, the Court found the witness credible and their testimony sufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Cruz's own flight from confinement further bolstered the prosecution's case.
