**Legal Document Summary: *Abdulmaid K. Muin v. Samuel A. Avestruz, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-04-1831, February 2, 2009**

**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning dishonesty, grave misconduct, and malversation of public funds.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Judge Abdulmaid K. Muin (reporting judge)
*   **Respondent:** Samuel A. Avestruz, Jr. (Court Interpreter and former Officer-in-Charge, RTC Branch 5, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi)

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Factual Background:** Avestruz, as OIC-Clerk of Court, failed to turn over court funds and books of account upon Judge Muin's instruction. He absented himself without leave (AWOL) and was found to have made unauthorized withdrawals from the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) and the Fiduciary Fund (FF) without proper court orders.
*   **Shortages:** An audit revealed shortages of P8,473.00 in the JDF and P1,738,579.00 in the FF.
*   **Unauthorized Withdrawals:** Avestruz, with the aid of a bank employee, made unauthorized withdrawals.
*   **AWOL:** Avestruz's absence without official leave was previously addressed in A.M. No. 03-11-655-RTC, resulting in him being dropped from the rolls.
*   **OCA Investigation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) investigated and recommended dismissal. A criminal complaint for malversation and infidelity in the custody of public documents was filed against Avestruz with the Office of the Ombudsman.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Liability for Shortages:** Avestruz is liable for the shortages in the JDF and FF.
*   **Restitution:** He is ordered to restitute the amounts of P8,473.00 (JDF) and P1,738,579.00 (FF).
*   **Forfeiture:** Avestruz forfeits retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits).
*   **Disqualification:** He is perpetually disqualified from re-employment in the government.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Avestruz's Absence:** His continued absence hampered the investigation and defense. This absence was construed as an admission of guilt. "Flight is an indicium of guilt."
*   **Lack of Records:** The OCA audit team faced difficulties due to the disappearance of court records, potentially affecting the accuracy of the accountability figures.
*   **Possible Criminal Prosecution:**  The criminal complaint filed with the Ombudsman could lead to criminal charges and penalties.
*   **Case Law:** *Sy v. Mongcupa, 335 Phil. 182, 187 (1997).* - Sets precedent for holding accountable officers responsible.
*   **Statutory References:**
    *   Section 52 (A), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
    *   Section 50, Rule XVI, CSC MC No. 41, s. 1998 on the Omnibus Rules on Leave
*   **Ambiguity:** The precise details of the unauthorized withdrawals and the involvement of the bank employee are not fully elaborated, which could be significant in any subsequent criminal proceedings.
*   **Defense:** The document heavily emphasizes Avestruz's guilt, so a defense attorney would need to investigate whether any procedural rights were violated, whether the audit was properly conducted, and whether there's any evidence supporting Avestruz's innocence.

**Outcome:**

*   Avestruz is found guilty of dishonesty, grave misconduct, and malversation.
*   He is dismissed from service, ordered to restitute the funds, and perpetually disqualified from government employment.

**Legal Considerations:**

*   The Court relied on the principle that custodians of court funds are strictly liable for any shortages.
*   The Court considered Avestruz's AWOL and failure to respond as implied admissions of guilt.
*   The fact that Avestruz was only an OIC did not diminish his responsibilities or liabilities.
