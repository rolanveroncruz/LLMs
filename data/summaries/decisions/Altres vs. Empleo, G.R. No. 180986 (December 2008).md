## Legal Document Summary: *Altres v. Empleo*, G.R. No. 180986, December 10, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC denial of a Petition for Mandamus.

**Key Issue:** Whether the City Accountant or City Treasurer has the ministerial duty to issue a certification of availability of funds for newly appointed employees, specifically for the purposes of CSC approval.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) declared that Section 474(b)(4), not Section 344, of the Local Government Code of 1991 applies to the requirement of certification of availability of funds under Section 1(e)(ii), Rule V of CSC Memorandum Circular Number 40, Series of 1998. The City Accountant has the ministerial duty to issue the certification when required for CSC appointment approval purposes.

**Background:**

*   Petitioners were appointed to positions by the then-Mayor Quijano, but their appointments were disapproved by the CSC due to the lack of a certification of availability of funds from the City Accountant, Empleo.
*   The Sangguniang Panglungsod had requested a suspension of action on appointments due to budget concerns and alleged "midnight appointments."
*   The RTC denied the petition for mandamus, ruling that the duty to certify availability of funds lies with the City Treasurer, citing Section 344 of the Local Government Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 474(b)(4) of the Local Government Code (LGC):**  Obligates the City Accountant to "certify to the availability of budgetary allotment to which expenditures and obligations may be properly charged." The SC interprets this to include funds for new employee salaries.
*   **Section 344 of the LGC:**  Deals with the certification and approval of *vouchers* for disbursement of funds for existing, due, and demandable obligations.  The City Budget Officer, Accountant, and Treasurer must all provide certifications.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular Number 40, Series of 1998, Rule V, Section 1(e)(ii):** Requires certification of funds availability for LGU appointments before submission to CSC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **City Accountant:** Failure to issue the certification of availability of funds when required for CSC approval constitutes a dereliction of ministerial duty under Section 474(b)(4) LGC.
*   **Sangguniang Panglungsod:**  Potential for interference with the Mayor's appointment power if resolutions unduly delay or obstruct the appointment process based on improper motives.
*   **Petitioners:**  Their appointments were disapproved, though the ruling clarifies the correct interpretation of the law.
* **Mootness:** Although this specific case was rendered moot due to the final disapproval of the petitioners' appointments, the Court still decided on the merits due to the likelihood of recurrence of the issue.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160):** Sections 474(b)(4) and 344 are central to the dispute.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular Number 40, Series of 1998:** Establishes requirements for LGU appointments.
*   **De Rama v. Court of Appeals (405 Phil. 531, 2001):** Cited by petitioners regarding "midnight appointments" (though the SC ultimately found the case moot).
* **Doce√±a v. Lapesura (407 Phil. 1007 (2001):** Regarding the necessity of each plaintiff to provide personal knowledge when signing a certification.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "budgetary allotment" under Section 474(b)(4) LGC was contentious. The SC clarified that it includes funds for new employee salaries.
*   The distinction between certification for allotment (Section 474) versus certification for disbursement (Section 344) was a key point of contention.
*    The application of Section 344 regarding disbursement for regularly recurring administrative expenses versus approval by the local chief executive.

**Legal Precision and Further Notes:**

*   The SC emphasizes that the City Accountant's duty under 474(b)(4) arises before an actual obligation to pay exists (i.e., before CSC approval and commencement of services). Section 344 applies only *after* an obligation is established.
*   The ruling underscores the importance of understanding the different stages of the financial process within LGUs and the respective roles of the Budget Officer, Accountant, and Treasurer.
* The case discusses the specific and limited exception to the necessity of full compliance with all plaintiffs providing personal knowledge and confirmation of the allegations in the case.
*    While the appointments were considered to be disapproved, the Court still ruled to provide guidance for LGUs.
