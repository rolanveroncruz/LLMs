Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Enriquez v. Office of the Ombudsman*, G.R. Nos. 174902-06, February 15, 2008 (569 Phil. 309).

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Mandamus seeking to compel the Office of the Ombudsman to dismiss administrative and criminal cases against Petitioners.

**Facts:** Petitioners, Alfredo Enriquez, Gener Endona, and Rhandolfo Amansec, were charged in multiple administrative and criminal cases by the Fact-Finding and Intelligence Bureau (FFIB) of the Office of the Ombudsman in 2000, related to alleged irregularities in the Land Titling Computerization Project of the LRA.  After submitting counter-affidavits, participating in hearings, and formally offering evidence by January 2002, the Ombudsman failed to resolve the cases. Despite motions for resolution and eventual dismissal based on inordinate delay, the Ombudsman remained inactive.

**Issues:**

1.  Is Mandamus the appropriate remedy?
2.  Did the Ombudsman violate the Petitioners' constitutional right to a speedy disposition of their cases?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted the petition, ordering the dismissal of all administrative and criminal cases against the Petitioners.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Mandamus as a Remedy:** While mandamus generally compels ministerial duties, it is appropriate when discretion is exercised with grave abuse of discretion. The Court held that the Ombudsman’s failure to resolve the cases for almost eight years constituted grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, making mandamus applicable. This aligns with established jurisprudence (e.g., *Licaros v. Sandiganbayan*, *Chavez v. PCGG*).
*   **Violation of Right to Speedy Disposition:**  The Court emphasized the constitutional right to a speedy disposition of cases (Article III, Section 16).  It cited established jurisprudence that this right is violated when delays are vexatious, capricious, and oppressive (*Dela Peña v. Sandiganbayan*). The court then discussed factors considered to determine if the right was violated, length of delay, the reasons for the delay, the aggrieved party’s assertion or failure to assert such right, and the prejudice caused by the delay (*Binay v. Sandiganbayan*, *Castillo v. Sandiganbayan*). The court emphasized the constitutional and statutory mandate, powers and duties of respondent. Respondent was constitutionally created to be the “protector of the people,” with the expressed mandate that it “shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against officers or employees of the Government, or of any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and enforce their administrative, civil and criminal liability in every case where the evidence warrants in order to promote efficient service by the Government to the people. The Court found the delay unreasonable and unjustified, particularly given the Ombudsman's duty under the Constitution and Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989) to act promptly and efficiently. The Court rejected the Ombudsman's excuse of "extreme care" in reviewing the cases, citing *Duterte v. Sandiganbayan* and *Tatad v. Sandiganbayan* which rejected similar justifications for prolonged delays.  The Court also distinguished the cases from Roque v. Office of the Ombudsman, Lopez, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Constitutional Right to Speedy Disposition (Article III, Section 16):**  Fundamental right of all persons.
*   **Ombudsman's Duty to Act Promptly (Constitution and RA 6770):**  Mandate to investigate and prosecute cases efficiently. Section 6, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman) provides that a hearing officer is given “not later than thirty (30) days” to resolve the case after the formal investigation shall have been concluded.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Ombudsman can be compelled to act via mandamus when inaction constitutes a grave abuse of discretion that violates the law.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Inordinate Delay":**  The case highlights the subjective nature of determining "inordinate delay." While a lengthy delay is a key factor, the Court emphasized considering the specific circumstances.
*   **Excuses for Delay:** The decision reinforces the limited acceptability of justifications based on "meticulous scrutiny" or "layers of review," particularly after substantial periods of inaction.

**Relevance:**

The case underscores the importance of expeditious resolution of cases by the Ombudsman and provides a strong precedent for asserting the right to a speedy disposition. The Ombudsman's failure to act promptly and efficiently not only violated petitioners' constitutional right but was also against the agency's own mandate to promote efficiency in the government.
