Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Mr. Roberto Nieva*, G.R. No. 124100, April 1, 1998. (351 Phil. 827)

**Facts:** Roberto Nieva, a Philtranco driver, was involved in an accident, arrested, and subsequently released on a bail bond secured by Philtranco. He was initially suspended. Later, due to issues with his bail, he was effectively placed on indefinite unpaid leave, instructed not to drive until the case was settled. Upon resolution, he was refused reinstatement and told to re-apply. Nieva filed an illegal dismissal case.

**Issue:** Whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in (1) denying Philtranco’s motion to dismiss based on improper venue, (2) ruling Philtranco should pay backwages and separation pay, and (3) finding no abandonment of work by Nieva.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.  Petition DISMISSED.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Venue:** The Court held that under Section 1(a), Rule IV of the NLRC Rules of Procedure (regarding venue), is permissive and meant for the convenience of the employee, who can waive it. Manila was considered part of Nieva's workplace due to his Legaspi City-Pasay City route.  Cited *Dayag vs. NLRC* and *Sulpicio Lines, Inc. vs. NLRC*.
*   **Illegal Dismissal/Abandonment:** The Court affirmed the NLRC's finding that Nieva was illegally dismissed and did not abandon his job.  Nieva's continued pursuit of the case and reporting for work negated the abandonment claim. The employer instructed him not to work. The filing of illegal dismissal case is inconsistent with abandonment (Cited *PASUDECO vs. NLRC* and others).
*   **Backwages and Separation Pay:** The NLRC correctly awarded backwages (P67,392.00) and separation pay (P33,696.00) to Nieva.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Philtranco is obligated to pay Roberto Nieva:** Backwages (P67,392.00) and separation pay (P33,696.00).
*   **Employer cannot unilaterally suspend or terminate employment** without due process and valid cause.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Findings Finality:** The Court emphasized it would not re-examine the NLRC’s factual findings, unless there is grave abuse of discretion. This limits the scope of review.
*   **"Permissive" Venue Rule:**  While the NLRC venue rule is framed as regarding the location of the workplace of the complaintant, the decision further cements the "permissive" nature, potentially creating ambiguity.
*   **Estoppel:** Philtranco's actions in initially securing the bail bond and instructing Nieva to cease driving contributed to the finding against them.
*   **"Instructions" on Not Working:** Employer's specific instruction played a significant role in negating the abandonment claim.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, Section 1(a), Rule IV:** (Venue of Cases). Interpreted as permissive and for the benefit of the employee.
*   **Dayag vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 124193, March 6, 1998:** Regarding permissive nature of venue rules.
*   **Sulpicio Lines, Inc. vs. NLRC, 254 SCRA 507 (1996):** Regarding the definition of "workplace" for venue purposes.
*   **PASUDECO vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 112650, May 29, 1997:**  Immediate filing of illegal dismissal complaint negates abandonment.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   Philtranco argued improper venue, claiming Nieva's workplace was in Legaspi City. The Court rejected this, considering the Pasay City route.
*   Philtranco argued abandonment of work based on alleged AWOL reports and letters. The Court gave more weight to Nieva's account and the fact that he continuously reported and filed a complaint.
