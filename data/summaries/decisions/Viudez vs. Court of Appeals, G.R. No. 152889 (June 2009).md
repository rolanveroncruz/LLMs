**Case Summary: *Enrique V. Viudez II v. Court of Appeals and Hon. Basilio R. Gabo, Jr.***

**Citation:** 606 Phil. 337 (G.R. No. 152889, June 05, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision dismissing a petition for certiorari against the RTC Judge's denial of a motion to suspend proceedings and the implementation of a warrant of arrest.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Viudez was charged with murder (two counts) based on a finding of probable cause by the Provincial Prosecutor.
*   RTC issued warrants of arrest.
*   Viudez filed a Motion to Suspend Proceedings and the Implementation of the Warrant of Arrest, citing DOJ Department Circular No. 70, arguing that a petition for review was filed with the Secretary of Justice (SOJ).
*   RTC denied the motion, stating it lacked jurisdiction over Viudez as he had not been arrested or surrendered.
*   CA dismissed Viudez's petition for certiorari.
*   SOJ later sustained Viudez's petition for review and directed the Chief State Prosecutor to move for the withdrawal of the Informations.  The informations were subsequently withdrawn by the RTC.
*   Despite the motion to withdraw the information, the Supreme Court decided to rule on the merit of the case as implored by the petitioner.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **DOJ Department Circular No. 70, Section 9:**  Addresses the effect of an appeal to the SOJ on criminal proceedings.  The circular directs the appellant and the trial prosecutor to ensure court proceedings are held in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal.
*   **Judge's Duty to Determine Probable Cause:** The judge has the exclusive function to determine the existence of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest.
*   **Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Provides that the head of the office to whom the warrant of arrest has been delivered for execution shall cause the warrant to be executed within ten (10) days from receipt thereof.
*   **Trial Court Discretion:** Trial court has discretion to suspend the proceedings or the implementation of the warrant of arrest, upon the motion of the appellant or the trial prosecutor.
*   **Section 4, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Expressly recognizes the authority and power of the Department of Justice to prescribe the rules to be followed in cases of a petition for review of a resolution of the Chief State Prosecutor, Provincial or City Prosecutors.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Risk of Arrest:** Viudez faced arrest due to the outstanding warrant.
*   **Deprivation of Liberty:** Potential deprivation of liberty without due process.
*   **Potential Liability of the Judge:**  Although ultimately no finding of liability was found, the case initially involved the issue of whether the judge abused his discretion by not adhering to the DOJ Circular.
*   **Encroachment on Judicial Prerogative:** The court explicitly states deferring the implementation of the warrant of arrest would be an encroachment on the exclusive prerogative of the judge to determine probable cause.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **DOJ Department Circular No. 70:** Central to the argument regarding the suspension of proceedings.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 113, Section 4:** Concerns the timeline for the execution of the warrant of arrest.
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Sec. 4 of Rule 112:** Recognizes the authority of the Department of Justice to prescribe rules in cases of a petition for review.
*   **Baltazar v. People, G.R. No. 174016, July 28, 2008, 560 SCRA 278:**  Distinguishes between probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest (judicial function) and the preliminary investigation proper (executive function).
*   **Marcelo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 106695, 1994, 235 SCRA 39:**  Addresses the issue of whether the arraignment of an accused may be deferred pending resolution by the Secretary of Justice of a petition for review on the finding of probable cause, to which this Court ruled in the affirmative.
*   **Ledesma v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 113216, September 5, 1997, 278 SCRA 656:** Addresses the issue of whether the arraignment of an accused may be deferred pending resolution by the Secretary of Justice of a petition for review on the finding of probable cause, to which this Court ruled in the affirmative.
*   **Dimatulac v. Villon, G.R. No. 127107, October 12, 1998, 297 SCRA 679:** Addresses the issue of whether the arraignment of an accused may be deferred pending resolution by the Secretary of Justice of a petition for review on the finding of probable cause, to which this Court ruled in the affirmative.
*   **Roberts, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 113930, March 5, 1996, 254 SCRA 307:** Addresses the issue of whether the arraignment of an accused may be deferred pending resolution by the Secretary of Justice of a petition for review on the finding of probable cause, to which this Court ruled in the affirmative.
*   **Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. v. How, G.R. No. 140863, August 22, 2000, 338 SCRA 511:** Addresses the issue of whether the arraignment of an accused may be deferred pending resolution by the Secretary of Justice of a petition for review on the finding of probable cause, to which this Court ruled in the affirmative.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of DOJ Circular No. 70, Section 9:** Whether "proceedings in court are held in abeyance" includes the implementation of a warrant of arrest.  The Court ultimately held it does *not* mandate suspension of the warrant's implementation.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition. The Court held that DOJ Department Circular No. 70 does not mandate the trial court to suspend the implementation of a warrant of arrest pending the resolution of a petition for review by the Secretary of Justice. The trial court retains discretion in this matter, and the Court of Appeals did not err in finding no abuse of discretion by the trial judge. The finding of probable cause to issue a warrant of arrest is a judicial function that is exclusive to the court.
