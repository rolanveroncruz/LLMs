**Legal Document Summary**

**Case:** *Purisimo Buyco v. Nelson Baraquia*, G.R. No. 177486, December 21, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari, questioning the validity of a preliminary injunction after the dismissal of the underlying complaint.

**Facts:** Nelson Baraquia (Respondent) sued the Buycos for a right of way, injunction, and damages. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the Buycos from closing off a private road. Later, the RTC dismissed the complaint for failure to establish the essential requisites for an easement of right of way under Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code, lifting the preliminary injunction. Respondent appealed. The Buycos were initially held in contempt of court for violating the injunction by closing the road, but the trial court reversed this decision, citing *Lee v. Court of Appeals* that the preliminary injunction remains valid pending appeal.

**Issue:** Whether a preliminary injunction is automatically dissolved upon dismissal of the underlying complaint, even if the dismissal is pending appeal.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that the lifting of a writ of preliminary injunction due to the dismissal of the complaint *is* immediately executory, even if the dismissal of the complaint is pending appeal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 649 & 650 of the Civil Code:** These articles define the requirements for establishing an easement of right of way. The original complaint hinged on proving these elements.
*   **Rule 58, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Defines a preliminary injunction as a provisional remedy.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** The Buycos faced potential liability for contempt, but this was overturned by the Court. If the injunction had remained valid, further violations would have subjected them to further contempt proceedings.
*   **Damages:** Though the original case involved a claim for damages, the Buycos' partial appeal on the non-award of damages was ultimately irrelevant due to the ruling on the injunction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code:**  Foundation for establishing an easement of right of way.
*   **Rule 58, Section 1, Revised Rules of Court:** Defines preliminary injunctions.
*   ***Lee v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 147191, July 27, 2006, 496 SCRA 668:**  Trial court initially relied on this case, which was found to be inapposite.
*   ***Unionbank v. Court of Appeals*, 370 Phil. 837 (1999):** This case establishes the principle that dismissal of an action dissolves a temporary injunction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The main contention revolved around the interpretation of the effect of an appeal on a preliminary injunction that had been lifted following the dismissal of the main case. The Court clarified that the appeal does not revive the injunction.
*   Applicability of *Lee v. Court of Appeals*. The Supreme Court distinguished the present case from *Lee* because in *Lee*, the underlying case had not yet been decided on the merits by the lower court, whereas in the present case, the complaint was dismissed.

**Legal Precision:**

The Supreme Court unequivocally stated that a preliminary injunction is merely an ancillary remedy, and its purpose is to preserve the status quo *pending* a final decision. Once the main case is dismissed, the injunction is automatically dissolved, regardless of any pending appeal, unless the appellate court issues a new injunction. This ruling provides clear guidance on the lifespan of preliminary injunctions in relation to the disposition of the underlying case.
