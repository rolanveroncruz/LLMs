## Summary of *Flora III v. Atty. Luna* (A.C. No. 11486)

**Nature of the Case:** This is an administrative case filed by Fernando Flora III against Atty. Giovanni Luna for unethical conduct.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation of CPR:** Atty. Luna found liable for violating Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) for engaging in dishonest conduct.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The Court found that Atty. Luna unjustly enriched himself by retaining the P43,500 paid by Flora for legal services that were not rendered because the criminal cases were settled at the barangay level, where lawyers are not required.
*   **Unprofessional Conduct:** Atty. Luna's act of shouting at the complainant and claiming the payment was insufficient was deemed disrespectful and unbecoming of a lawyer. *Cf. Spouses Nuezca v. Atty. Villagarcia, 792 Phil. 535 (2016)*.
*   **Contumacious Behavior:** Atty. Luna's failure to file an answer with the IBP-CBD and attend mandatory hearings demonstrated a contumacious attitude towards lawful orders and a disregard for his oath of office. *Cf. Ngayan v. Atty. Tugade, 271 Phil 654 (1991).*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Suspension:** Atty. Luna is suspended from the practice of law for three (3) months. *Cf. Spouses San Pedro v. Atty. Mendoza, 749 Phil. 540 (2014).*
*   **Restitution:** Atty. Luna is ordered to return P43,500 to Flora with 6% legal interest from the date of finality of the judgment until full payment.  *Cf. Martin v. Atty. Dela Cruz, A.C. No. 9832, September 4, 2017.* The Court distinguishes the non-refundability of acceptance fees, noting they only apply when legal services are rendered. *Cf. Jinon v. Atty. Jiz, 705 Phil. 321 (2013) and Agot v. Atty. Rivera, 740 Phil. 393 (2014).*
*   **Future Conduct:** Atty. Luna is warned that repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Disciplinary Action:** Repetition of similar misconduct could result in a more severe penalty, including disbarment.
*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** Flora may need to pursue legal avenues to enforce the restitution order if Atty. Luna fails to comply voluntarily.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the decision clearly finds against Atty. Luna, the relatively lenient penalty (3-month suspension) compared to disbarment or a longer suspension might be seen as contentious, as the Court did recognize similar cases where two-year suspensions were warranted. The decision emphasizes that this is Atty. Luna's first offense as the primary mitigating factor.
