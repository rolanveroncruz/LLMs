**Case Summary: People v. Duca, G.R. No. 171175, October 9, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari under Rule 65, challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision acquitting Arturo Duca of falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:**
Arturo Duca was charged with falsifying a Declaration of Real Property by signing his brother Aldrin's name, who was abroad at the time. The MCTC and RTC convicted Duca. The CA reversed, finding Duca had implied authority from Aldrin to secure the declaration.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Falsification (Art. 171, RPC):** The core charge hinges on whether Duca intentionally made it appear that Aldrin signed the document, causing damage.
*   **Due Process (Prosecution):** The central legal issue is whether the CA violated the People's right to due process by resolving Duca's appeal without notifying the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and requiring a comment.
*   **Representation of the State in Criminal Appeals:** The case firmly establishes that the OSG *exclusively* represents the People in criminal appeals before the CA and the Supreme Court (citing Sec. 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III of Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code; *Cariño v. De Castro, City Fiscal of Tacloban v. Espina, Labaro v. Panay*).
*   **Rule 42, Sections 1 and 3, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure**: Mandates that the adverse party (the People of the Philippines through the OSG) must be served copies of the petition for review. Failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.
*   **Authority to Act:** Duca claimed he had authority from Aldrin to sign the document. The CA accepted this defense, relying on a verbal authorization allegedly given and later formalized by an affidavit and Special Power of Attorney.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Arturo Duca:** Initially convicted, then acquitted. Potential liability for falsification depends on proving lack of authorization and intent to cause damage.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Obligation to ensure due process for all parties, including proper representation of the State by the OSG.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of OSG Representation:** The primary risk is the voiding of judgments due to the State's denial of due process if the OSG is not properly notified and involved in appellate proceedings. The case *Saldana v. Court of Appeals* underscores that a denial of due process makes the court's actions void for lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Ambiguity of Authorization:** The CA's reliance on a verbal authorization later "cured" by subsequent documentation is contentious. The validity and scope of the authorization are key to Duca's defense.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** The Supreme Court acknowledges the lack of a Motion for Reconsideration before the CA but applies an exception to the rule, deeming the CA decision void for lack of due process. (citing *National Housing v. Court of Appeals*)

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (Falsification)
*   Section 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III of Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code (Powers and Functions of the OSG)
*   Rule 42, Sections 1 and 3, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Petition for Review from the Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals)

**Case Law:**

*   Cariño v. De Castro
*   City Fiscal of Tacloban v. Espina
*   Labaro v. Panay
*   Saldana v. Court of Appeals
*   Uy v. Court of Appeals
*   Dimatulac v. Villon
*   Macawiwili Gold Mining and Development Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals
*   National Housing v. Court of Appeals
*   Progressive Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari, set aside the CA decision, and remanded the case to the CA for further proceedings, directing the CA to allow the OSG to be heard.

**Legal Precision Notes:**
The ruling emphasizes that regardless of the involvement of private prosecutors or local fiscals, the OSG *alone* holds the authority to represent the People in appellate criminal cases. The failure to serve the petition for review to OSG is grounds for dismissal of the appeal. The fact that lower court ruled in favour of the people is insufficient reason for OSG not to be given due process. The case does not yet resolve the underlying falsification charge but reaffirms jurisdictional requirements for appellate review.
