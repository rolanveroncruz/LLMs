**Legal Document Summary: Gutierrez v. Judge Belen (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2118)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against a judge.

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Regidor Gutierrez (Postman)
*   **Respondent:** Judge Medel Arnaldo B. Belen (RTC, Branch 36, Calamba, Laguna)

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   Complainant alleges Unbecoming Conduct and/or Harassment by Judge Belen.
*   Basis of complaint: Judge Belen allegedly pressured the complainant to sign a "Clarificatory Affidavit" regarding mail delivery related to a dismissed Estafa case filed by Judge Belen. Allegedly, Judge Belen threatened complainant and uttered "Punyeta ka" during a phone call.
*   The Clarificatory Affidavit aimed to correct inaccuracies in the complainant's original Affidavit regarding the delivery of registered mail to Judge Belen's residence.

**Obligations/Duties:**

*   **Judge Belen:** Allegedly, has a duty not to engage in conduct unbecoming of a judge and not to harass citizens.
*   **Complainant:** Duty to provide truthful testimony.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Judge Belen:** Potential administrative sanctions (dismissal, suspension, fine) if found guilty of unbecoming conduct or harassment. Risk of reputational damage regardless of outcome.
*   **Complainant:** Potential liability for perjury or false testimony if the "Clarificatory Affidavit" accurately reflects the facts and his initial affidavit was inaccurate (although this is not explicitly pursued in this case).

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Postal Manual, Sec. 16:** Regarding proper delivery of registered mail matter.
*   **Planas v. Reyes (A.M. No. RTJ-05-1905):**  Establishes burden of proof in administrative proceedings resting on the complainant and the standard of substantial evidence (Ong v. Rosete, A.M. No. 04-1538, October 22, 2004, 441 SCRA 150); also reiterates presumption that respondent regularly performed duties and that charges based on mere suspicion cannot be given credence (Ever Emporium, Inc. v. Judge Maceda, A.M. Nos. RTJ-04-1881 and RTJ-04-1882, October 14, 2004, 440 SCRA 298).
*   **Kilat v. Macias, A.M. No. RTJ-5-1960, October 25, 2005, 474 SCRA 101:** Administrative charges against members of the judiciary must be supported at least by substantial evidence or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The factual dispute centers around whether Judge Belen actually shouted the invective "Punyeta ka" and threatened the complainant. The Investigating Justice finds Judge Belen's denial credible, corroborated by a disinterested witness (Sheriff Rimas).
*   Complainant's truthfulness in his initial affidavit is questioned, with the Investigating Justice finding contradictions between the affidavit and his later testimony.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court **dismissed** the administrative complaint against Judge Belen for lack of factual or legal basis. The Court found that the complainant failed to present substantial evidence to prove the charges of unbecoming conduct and/or harassment. The Court emphasized that the complainant filed the administrative case as a retaliatory measure.
