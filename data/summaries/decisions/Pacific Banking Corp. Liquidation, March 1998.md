Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution:

**Case:** *Pacific Banking Corporation Employees Organization vs. Court of Appeals and Vitaliano N. Nañagas II* (G.R. No. 109373) and *The President of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, Hon. Judge Regino T. Veridiano II, Deputy Sheriff Ramon Enriquez and Ang Eng Joo, Ang Keong Lan and E.J Ang Int’l. Ltd.* (G.R. No. 112991)

**Document:** Resolution denying PDIC’s Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and noting LBP's manifestations.

**Core Issue:** Whether the PDIC (as liquidator of Pacific Banking Corporation or PaBC) perfected its appeal in G.R. No. 112991 by filing a record on appeal.  Subsidiary issues relate to allegations of suppression of the record on appeal and potential wrongdoing by the branch clerk of court.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Appeal Perfection:**  The Court affirms its earlier decision that the appeal in G.R. No. 112991 was *not* perfected due to the failure to file a record on appeal. The Court applied Section 29 of the Central Bank Act (R.A. No. 265), as amended by E.O. No. 289, July 25, 1987 now Sec. 30 of the New Central Bank Act, R.A. No. 7653, June 14, 1993, which identifies liquidation proceedings as special proceedings and requires the filing of record on appeal.
*   **Burden of Proof:** PDIC, as the party asserting that a record on appeal was filed, bore the burden of proving it. The Court held that PDIC failed to meet this burden, finding the evidence presented by private respondents more convincing. This aligns with established jurisprudence: *Summa Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 641 (1996).*
*   **Suppression Allegation:** The Court rejected PDIC's claim of suppression of the record on appeal, relying heavily on the findings of the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) following an investigation.  The Court stated: *Trans-Pacific Supplies, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 235 SCRA 494 (1994)* The OCA concluded that no record on appeal was ever filed.
*   **Branch Clerk:** The Court maintains its finding that the branch clerk of court was *not* guilty of any wrongdoing in certifying that no record on appeal was filed, upholding the presumption of good faith and official regularity. *Bernardino v. Ignacio, 253 SCRA 641 (1996); Santiago v. Court of Appeals, 248 SCRA 336 (1995)*.
*   **LBP Manifestations:** The Court noted LBP's manifestations regarding garnishments by private respondents and the BIR but declined to rule on their validity, stating that these relate to the execution of the trial court's decision, over which the Supreme Court no longer has jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Execution of Trial Court Decision:** The resolution clears the way for the execution of the trial court's decision. This includes the garnishments of PaBC funds by private respondents and potentially the BIR.
*   **PDIC Liability:** PDIC faces potential liability to creditors of PaBC, as the failure to perfect the appeal prevents further challenges to the underlying judgment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Central Bank Act (R.A. No. 265), Section 29 (now Section 30 of R.A. No. 7653) – Pertaining to liquidation proceedings of banks.

**Case Law:**

*   *Summa Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 641 (1996)* – Burden of Proof in civil cases.
*   *Trans-Pacific Supplies, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 235 SCRA 494 (1994)* - Burden of proving affirmative relief.
*   *Sadhwani v. Court of appeals, G.R. No. 128119, October 17, 1997; Javier v. Court of Appeals, 231 SCRA 498 (1994)* - Burden of proving affirmative relief.
*   *Bernardino v. Ignacio, 253 SCRA 641 (1996); Santiago v. Court of Appeals, 248 SCRA 336 (1995)* - Presumption of good faith.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main area of contention remains the factual dispute over the filing of the record on appeal.  The alleged discrepancy in the branch clerk's signature and initials presented a significant point of disagreement, although the Court ultimately sided with the clerk's denial.
*   The Court's disavowal of jurisdiction over the LBP manifestations, deeming them matters of execution, may leave LBP in a difficult position regarding potentially conflicting garnishment orders.
