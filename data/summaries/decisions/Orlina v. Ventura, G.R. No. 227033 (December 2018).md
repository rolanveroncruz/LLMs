**Case:** *Reynaldo E. Orlina v. Cynthia Ventura, represented by Her Sons Elvic Jhon Herrera and Eric Von Herrera* G.R. No. 227033, December 03, 2018

**Summary:**
This case concerns a property dispute arising from a tax delinquency sale. Orlina (Petitioner) purchased Ventura's (Respondent) property at a tax auction due to unpaid real property taxes. After the redemption period lapsed, Orlina secured a Final Bill of Sale and successfully petitioned the RTC to cancel Ventura's title (TCT No. 272336) and issue a new one in his name. Ventura, upon learning of this, filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing lack of jurisdiction due to improper notice. The RTC denied her motions. The CA reversed the RTC decision, finding that Ventura was not properly notified of the proceedings, thus violating her due process rights and invalidating the RTC's jurisdiction. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision with modification.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Tax Delinquency and Auction Sale:** Property was sold at public auction due to Ventura's failure to pay real property taxes (amounting to P27,471.18). The auction itself is not the primary issue but the subsequent approval of the Final Bill of Sale without proper notice. Reference to relevant tax sale laws (local government code) would be pertinent, not referenced in the document.
*   **Approval of Final Bill of Sale (PD 1529, Sec. 75):** Orlina filed a petition under Section 75 of PD 1529 for the approval of the Final Bill of Sale. This is the core action scrutinized by the courts.
*   **Jurisdictional Due Process:** The crucial issue is whether Ventura received proper notice of the petition for approval of the Final Bill of Sale. The CA and SC found that she did not. Key issue is the interpretation of "notice" within the context of PD 1529 and relevant jurisprudence on actions *in rem*.
*   **Remedies Under PD 1529 (Sec. 75 & 108):** The Court emphasizes that Sections 75 and 108 of P.D. No. 1529 are applicable, concerning the application for a new certificate upon expiration of the redemption period and the amendment and alteration of certificates. The court classified the case as an action *in rem*, requiring due process even without personal jurisdiction.
*   **Collateral Attack:** Orlina argued that Ventura's challenge was a collateral attack on his title. The SC rejected this, because of the RTC decision was void for lack of jurisdiction, it could be attacked at any time.
*   **Certiorari as a Remedy:** Orlina argued that Ventura improperly availed of certiorari when her remedy of appeal had lapsed. The Court noted exceptions to this rule, particularly when a judgment is void for lack of due process. *Montoya v. Varilla* and *Salva v. Valle* are cited as supporting cases.
*   **Verification/Certification of Non-Forum Shopping:** Orlina challenged the validity of Ventura's filing before the CA, because her sons signed the verification/certification, instead of her. The SC dismissed this, due to Ventura's location in the US, and liberally applied the rules of procedure.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Orlina:** Ordered to return the property to Ventura. Liable for any damages resulting from his possession and assertion of ownership based on the void title.
*   **Ventura:** Must address the original tax delinquency. The Supreme Court did not rule on the tax delinquency itself.
*   **City Treasurer of Quezon City:** Implicitly implicated for potentially flawed notice procedures in the petition for approval of the Final Bill of Sale. The court did not rule on liability for improper tax sale proceedings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Clouded Title:** The property's title history will be complex. Any future transactions will require careful examination of the tax sale and subsequent legal proceedings.
*   **Further Litigation:** While Ventura regained the title, Orlina could potentially pursue other legal avenues, if available and not barred by res judicata, such as a claim for unjust enrichment or a separate action contesting the validity of the tax sale.
*   **Tax Sale Validity:** The SC did not rule on the validity of the original tax sale. Ventura may still have grounds to challenge this if she can demonstrate irregularities, subject to statutes of limitations and other defenses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The document cites several cases to support its reasoning, including *PO2 Montoya v. Police Director Varilla*, *Gomeco Metal Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, *Salva v. Valle*, and *Philippine National Bank (PNB) v. Spouses Perez*.  These cases primarily address due process violations and the permissibility of certiorari in cases where appeals were not timely filed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document refers to a "Demand to Vacate" sent to 201 Quirino Highway, Baesa, Quezon City, but refers to the petition for the approval of bill of sale being addressed to 201 EDSA, Baesa, Caloocan City, which may be inconsistent. Whether these were truly the same property, or how Orlina obtained addresses of the property are ambiguous and are likely to be questioned in further proceedings.
*   Whether the addresses of the property in the various documents, were accurate and consistent throughout the proceedings. Orlina referred to three different addresses in his petition, which the Court found questionable.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the City Treasurer's records to determine the exact procedure for the sale conducted and analyze if procedural requirements under the Local Government Code were strictly followed in the tax sale.
*   Investigate the validity of the tax sale itself, potentially challenging the tax assessment or sale procedures if grounds exist.
*   Prepare for potential claims from Orlina, such as unjust enrichment, and consider settlement options.
*   Ensure all future communications and legal proceedings adhere strictly to procedural requirements, especially concerning notice, to avoid further due process challenges.
