**Case Summary: *Go v. Hortaleza*, A.M. No. P-05-1971, June 26, 2008**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Deputy Sheriff Vinez A. Hortaleza for Abuse of Authority and Illegal Exaction related to the implementation of a writ of execution in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 1512, MTC Mangaldan).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complaint:** Jorge Q. Go alleged that Hortaleza illegally demanded and received P5,000.00 for expenses related to the execution of the writ *after* the complainant had already deposited P161,042.00 with the OCC to secure the release of his vehicle, which had been levied upon. No official receipt was issued despite requests.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Hortaleza argued that the P5,000.00 was used for expenses authorized under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, including payment to a mechanic (P4,000.00), a key master (P500.00), and transportation (P500.00).
*   **OCA Finding:** Recommended suspension for one month for simple misconduct.
*   **Court's Ruling:** Found Hortaleza guilty of simple misconduct and violation of Section 5(a) and (d) of R.A. No. 6713. Sentenced to a two-month suspension without pay and reprimand.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff's Obligations:**
    *   To adhere to Section 9, Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court concerning the proper procedure for handling sheriff's expenses: Estimate expenses, seek court approval, deposit with Clerk of Court, Clerk disburses to Sheriff, liquidation, return of unspent funds.  Violation constitutes misconduct. *Abalde v. Roque, A.M. No. P-02-1643* reinforces adherence to this procedure.
    *   To act promptly on letters and requests from the public, pursuant to Section 5 of R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) and Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 08-99.
    *   Ministerial duty to execute writs of execution expeditiously.  *Zarate v. Untalan, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1584* underscores this duty.
*   **Sheriff's Liability:** Liable for administrative sanctions for failure to comply with procedural rules and ethical standards.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity Regarding Intent:** The Court acknowledged that there was no clear evidence of intent to gain, which could have resulted in a finding of dishonesty or serious misconduct. However, the Court still found the sheriff's actions constituted simple misconduct, which is sufficient for administrative sanction.
*   **Risk of Abuse of Authority:** The case highlights the risk of sheriffs circumventing established procedures for personal gain, even if the amounts involved are relatively small.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** The failure to issue an official receipt and respond to inquiries further exacerbated the situation and suggested a lack of transparency on the part of the sheriff.
*   **Impact on Public Trust:** The Court emphasized the importance of maintaining public trust in the judiciary, which is undermined when court officials engage in improper conduct.  *Visitacion, Jr. v. Ediza, A.M. No. P-01-1495* emphasizes the importance of maintaining public trust.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Section 9, Rule 141, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs sheriff's expenses and procedures.
*   **Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Deals with execution of judgments but does not excuse deviation from Rule 141.
*   **R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Mandates prompt action on letters and requests.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 08-99:** Reinforces R.A. 6713 for judiciary employees.
*   **Zarate v. Untalan, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1584:** Sheriff's duty to execute writs.
*   **Abalde v. Roque, A.M. No. P-02-1643:** Proper procedure for handling sheriff's expenses
*   **Danao v. Franco, Jr., A.M. No. P-02-1569:** Analogous case where similar violation was deemed simple misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a reminder to sheriffs of the importance of adhering to established procedures for handling expenses and maintaining transparency in their dealings with the public. Failure to do so can result in administrative sanctions, even in the absence of clear evidence of corrupt intent.
