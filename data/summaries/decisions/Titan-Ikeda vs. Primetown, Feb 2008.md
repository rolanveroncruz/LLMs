Okay, here is a summary of the *Titan-Ikeda Construction & Development Corporation vs. Primetown Property Group, Inc.* case (G.R. No. 158768, February 12, 2008):

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a construction dispute arising from a supplemental agreement for architectural works on a 32-story condominium tower. The parties agreed to a "full-swapping" payment scheme using condominium units.  The central issue is whether the supplemental agreement was extinguished by the parties' subsequent actions, and the implications of that extinguishment on the obligations and liabilities of each party.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Construction Contract and Supplemental Agreement:** The parties entered into a construction contract and a subsequent supplemental agreement. The supplemental agreement incorporated provisions from the original construction contract, designating GEMM as the construction manager.
*   **"Full-Swapping" Payment:** The supplemental agreement stipulated payment via condominium units, with 80% transfer upon posting of a performance bond and the remaining 20% upon project completion.
*   **Takeover of Project:** Primetown took over the project, evidenced by a letter signed by both parties, leading to the extinguishment of the supplemental agreement by mutual consent. This is a critical finding.
*   **Integratech, Inc. (ITI) Report:** Primetown hired ITI to evaluate project progress. ITI's report indicated only 48.71% project completion. The court found that the report cannot bind petitioner, because petitioner never consented to ITI being construction manager (GEMM was originally stipulated in the contract)
*   **Solutio Indebiti (Undue Payment):** Because the supplemental agreement was extinguished, the court focused on the principle of solutio indebiti, holding that Titan-Ikeda was obligated to return condominium units exceeding the value of services actually rendered.
*   **Unjust Enrichment Claim:** Primetown argued for recovery based on unjust enrichment, but the court ruled against it.
*   **Claims for Recovery of Additional Costs for Changes**: The Court ruled against the contractor for failure to adhere to the requisite of Article 1724, no written order nor agreement as to increase in cost was provided
*   **Claims for Compensatory Damages**: The Court disallowed the damages because the lost profits were not proven.

**Obligations:**

*   **Titan-Ikeda:** Obligated to return condominium units and parking slots exceeding the proportionate value of work completed.
*   **Primetown:** Upon Titan-Ikeda fulfilling the above, Primetown must deliver the keys and management certificate to units equivalent to work completed

**Liabilities:**

*   **Titan-Ikeda:** Potentially liable for returning condominium units or their equivalent value (sale proceeds or action for collection) for units already sold, and for unjust enrichment. The amount depends on the percentage of work completed.
*   **Primetown:** Potentially liable for remaining outstanding claims that can be proved and were not repudiated.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** Determining the fair market value of the condominium units at the time of the "swapping" is crucial and potentially contentious.
*   **Proof of Completion Percentage:** Establishing the exact percentage of project completion as of the date of the takeover will be key to calculating the amount due. ITI's report is considered suspect.
*   **Claims against Third-Party Buyers:** If Titan-Ikeda sold units that it must now return, potential litigation with third-party buyers could arise.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1305 (Civil Code):** Contract definition
*   **Article 1713 (Civil Code):** Contract for a piece of work.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **The actual terms and conditions of the letter agreement dated October 12, 1995, regarding project supervision. The court concluded that it was a takeover.**
*   The valuation of the condominium units at the time of the deed of sale is unclear.

**Outcome and Remand:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and remanded the case to the RTC for further proceedings to: (1) determine the percentage of architectural work completed by Titan-Ikeda as of October 12, 1995; (2) determine the number of condominium units and parking slots sold by Titan-Ikeda to third parties; and (3) compute the actual liability of each party, considering allowable claims.
