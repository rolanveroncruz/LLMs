**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Felix Palgan*, G.R. No. 186234 (2009)**

**Nature:** Final review of conviction for two counts of rape.

**Parties:**

*   **Appellant:** Felix Palgan (Stepfather)
*   **Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Victim:** AAA (Stepdaughter)

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Palgan was charged and convicted of two counts of rape under Article 266-A(1-a) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Facts:** AAA testified that Palgan raped her on two separate occasions: March 16, 1997, and September 9, 1997. Force, threat and intimidation was alleged.
*   **Defense:** Palgan denied the allegations, presenting alibi evidence for both dates, claiming he was either at a distant rubber plantation or that his wife and stepdaughter were absent from the home. He alleged ill motive on his wife's part for instigating AAA's allegations due to his refusal to sell land.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** Both the RTC and CA found Palgan guilty. The CA affirmed the RTC ruling with modification to the amount of civil indemnity awarded.

**Obligations:**

*   Palgan is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   Palgan is obligated to pay civil indemnity of P50,000.00 for each count of rape (total of P100,000.00).
*   Palgan is obligated to pay moral damages of P50,000.00 for each count of rape (total of P100,000.00).

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for two counts of rape.
*   Financial liability for civil indemnity and moral damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The conviction hinges largely on the credibility of AAA's testimony. Palgan's defense focused on undermining her credibility.
*   **Defense Weakness:** The Court explicitly stated that Palgan's defenses of denial and alibi were inherently weak and failed to overcome AAA's positive testimony.
*   **Familial Relationship:** The Court emphasized the moral ascendancy of the stepfather substituting for violence and intimidation.
*   **Lack of Resistance/Outcry:** The Court acknowledged that lack of resistance or crying out did not negate the crime, given the threat, intimidation, and fear employed by Palgan.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A(1-a) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape by carnal knowledge through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Article 266-B, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code:** Sets the penalty for rape at *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **People v. Glivano, G.R. No. 177565, January 28, 2008:** Outlines the principles guiding the courts in resolving rape cases.
*   **People v. Pacina, G.R. No. 123150, August 16, 2000:** Emphasizes the trial court's superior position to assess witness credibility.
*   **People v. Casil, 311 Phil. 300, 309 (1995):** The father's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitute for violence and intimidation.
*   **People v. Molleda, 463 Phil. 461, 471 (2003):** civil indemnity, which is actually in the nature of actual or compensatory damages, and mandatory upon the finding of the fact of rape.
*   **People v. Codilan, G.R. No. 177144, July 23, 2008:** which amount is automatically granted in a rape case without need of further proof other than the fact of its commission.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Felix Palgan for two counts of rape, emphasizing the victim's credible testimony and the weakness of the defense. The Court upheld the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for each count and modified the award for moral damages.
