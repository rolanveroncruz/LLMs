## Legal Document Summary: *Dr. Stella Marie P. Mabanag vs. Marvin A. Ramos* (A.M. No. P-23-111)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Marvin A. Ramos, Sheriff IV, for misappropriation of funds and unauthorized receipt of funds.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Simple Misconduct:** Ramos found guilty of simple misconduct for receiving PHP 50,000.00 from tenants without court authorization. This violates the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, which restricts personnel from duties outside their job description (2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, duties of Sheriff IV). Relevant case law: *Ressurreccion v. Ibuna, Jr.*, where a sheriff was disciplined for exceeding authority.
*   **Gross Misconduct:** Ramos found guilty of gross misconduct for misappropriating the PHP 50,000.00. This constitutes corruption and disregard of established rules. Text messages (admissible as electronic evidence under Rules on Electronic Evidence, *Asuncion v. Salvado*) established his admission of using the funds. His defense of returning funds to Dr. Mabanag's brother was deemed unsubstantiated, with a suspicious, likely falsified acknowledgement receipt. The "Dead Man's Statute" (Rules of Court, Rule 130, Sec 23, and *Garcia v. Vda. De Caparas*) prevented Ramos from using the acknowledgment to claim the funds were returned due to the brother's death. Further, failure to refute Dr. Mabanag's Affidavit of Desistance implicates implied admission (*Tan v. Alvarico*). *Judge Platil v. Mondano* provides precedent for misappropriation by court personnel.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Complainant's affidavit of desistance and motion to dismiss are *not* grounds for dismissal. The Court maintains disciplinary authority. This aligns with *Escalona v. Padillo*, stating the Court's interest in judicial employee conduct transcends complainant's wishes.
*   **Multiple Offenses:** The Court penalizes Ramos separately for simple and gross misconduct per Section 21 of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.
*   **Resignation:** Ramos's prior resignation (effective Dec 20, 2021) does *not* moot the administrative case (*OCA v. Amor*). Penalty in lieu of dismissal can be imposed (A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, Section 18). *Flores v. Interino*, and *Santiago v. Fernando*, and *Usama v. Tomarong* provide similar scenarios where resignation did not prevent the imposition of fines and penalties.
*   **Penalties:** Ramos is fined PHP 60,000.00 for simple misconduct and PHP 110,000.00 for gross misconduct (in lieu of dismissal). He is also perpetually disqualified from reinstatement/employment in public office. If the fine is not paid, it will be deducted from his benefits including accrued leave credits (A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC, Section 22).

**Obligations:**

*   Ramos is obligated to pay a total fine of PHP 170,000.00 within three months.
*   If unpaid, the amount will be deducted from his salaries and benefits, including his accrued leave credits.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for simple and gross misconduct.
*   Financial liability for the imposed fines.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Authentication of Acknowledgement Receipt:** The court questioned the authencity of the acknowledgement receipt used as a supporting document by the Sherriff.
*   **Collection of Fine:** Difficulty in collecting the fine if Ramos lacks sufficient benefits or accrued leave credits. Although the decision allows deduction from these sources, the ultimate collectability may be uncertain.
*   **Precedent:** The court cited previous administrative cases against Ramos (A.M. No. P-14-3225, OCA IPI No. 23-235-P, A.M. No. MTJ-13-1826, and OCA IPI No. 17-4662-RTJ), suggesting a pattern of misconduct, but the actual records of these cases should be reviewed to assess their impact.
*   **Characterization of Conduct:** The distinction between simple and gross misconduct may be subject to interpretation. The presence of "corruption" is key to the gross misconduct finding and should be carefully assessed.
