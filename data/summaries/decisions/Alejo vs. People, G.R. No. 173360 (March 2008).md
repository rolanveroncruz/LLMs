## Legal Document Summary - *Lt. Col. Pacifico G. Alejo vs. People of the Philippines*

**Case:** G.R. No. 173360, March 28, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Sandiganbayan Decision affirming RTC conviction for Malversation of Public Property (Art. 217, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 217, RPC (Malversation):** Defines the crime and penalties for public officers accountable for public funds/property who misappropriate, take, or allow others to take such funds/property.
*   **MOA (DENR-Region III and 7th ID, PA):** Establishes a cooperative framework for curbing illegal logging, designating the 7th ID as custodian of confiscated forest products (II. 2.8) and responsible for any loss of said items (II. 2.9).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner, Lt. Col. Alejo, was Commanding Officer of REPEWC and Task Force Commander of TFSLY, a joint military-DENR unit.
*   He was charged with malversation for allegedly misappropriating 1,000 board feet of confiscated logs valued at P20,000.
*   Witnesses (subordinates) testified Alejo instructed them to transport confiscated logs to his residence.
*   RTC initially acquitted on bribery and RA 3019 charges but convicted on malversation. Sandiganbayan affirmed conviction, modifying the penalty.

**Obligations:**

*   As Task Force Commander, Alejo had a duty to safeguard and account for confiscated logs under the MOA.
*   An accountable public officer is one who has custody or control of public funds or property by reason of the duties of his office. He need not be a bonded official.

**Liabilities:**

*   Convicted of Malversation of Public Property.
*   Sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 10 years and 1 day (prision mayor) to 16 years, 5 months, and 11 days (reclusion temporal).
*   Perpetual special disqualification.
*   Fine of P20,000.00 (equal to the amount malversed).
*   Costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accountability as Commander:**  Key issue is whether Alejo was directly accountable for the logs despite DENR's concurrent supervision. The defense argued the MOA did not establish his accountability. However, the prosecution highlighted provisions establishing the 7th ID's custodial role.
*   **Documentary Evidence:** Absence of specific inventory records of the logs. The conviction hinged on testimonial evidence and the stipulation by the defense about the logs' valuation. This lack of documentary evidence could be a point for appeal.
*   **Recanting Affidavits:** The prior recantation by prosecution witnesses poses credibility questions. However, the court favored their testimonies given under oath during trial.
*   **Testimonial Inconsistencies:** Minor inconsistencies in the witness testimonies regarding the unloading details.
*   **Defense Allegations of Intimidation:** The claim that witnesses were pressured by a General Soriano to testify against Alejo was unsubstantiated and rejected by the courts.
*   **Valuation:** Defense counsel stipulated the valuation of the logs at the time of confiscation, preventing challenge on that point.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 217:** Defines and punishes malversation of public property.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in determining the specific penalties.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 222:** Refers to private property seized or deposited by public authority may be the object of malversation.

**Relevant Case Law Cited:**

*   *People v. Matito, 468 Phil. 14, 24 (2004):*  Addresses credibility of witnesses.
*   *People v. Hipol, 454 Phil. 679, 689 (2003):* Defines an accountable public officer.
*   *Arriola v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 165711, 30 June 2006, 494 SCRA 344, 357:* Penalty for malversation.

**Overall:**

The conviction hinges on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the interpretation of the MOA.  The absence of documentary evidence of inventory and the earlier recantation by the witnesses are potential weaknesses, but these were deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction. Focus should be on the level of responsibility, the lack of documentary evidence for the logs and challenge the weight of the lower court's and Sandiganbayan's decision.
