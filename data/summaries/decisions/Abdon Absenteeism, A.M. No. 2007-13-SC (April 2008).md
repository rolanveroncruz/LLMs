**Case Summary: Re: Habitual Absenteeism of Mr. Erwin A. Abdon, Utility Worker II. A.M. No. 2007-13-SC (2008)**

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject:** Administrative matter regarding habitual absenteeism of Erwin A. Abdon, a utility worker.
*   **Unauthorized Absences:** Abdon incurred unauthorized absences in January, February, and June of 2007.
*   **Defense:** Abdon attributed the absences to acute gouty arthritis, providing medical certificates.
*   **OAS Finding:** The Office of Administrative Services (OAS) acknowledged the medical certificates for some absences but deemed the remaining absences unauthorized. Noted a prior reprimand for unauthorized absences (A.M. No. 2005-17-SC).
*   **OAS Recommendation:** Guilt of habitual absenteeism, suspension for one month, and warning against future infractions.
*   **SC Ruling:** Adopted the OAS findings and recommendation.

**Obligations:**

*   Judiciary employees are obligated to observe prescribed office hours and use official time efficiently, reflecting the principle that public office is a public trust.

**Liabilities:**

*   Abdon found guilty of habitual absenteeism.

**Penalties:**

*   Suspension for one month.
*   Stern warning that repetition of the offense will result in more severe punishment.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 14-2002:** Reiterates Civil Service Commission's policy on habitual absenteeism (unauthorized absences exceeding 2.5 days monthly leave credit for at least three months in a semester or three consecutive months). Cites a 6 month suspension for the first offense.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Specifies penalties for habitual absenteeism (suspension of six months and one day to one year for first offense, dismissal for second offense).
*   **Relevant jurisprudence:** The decision cites several cases to support its ruling and discusses the consideration of mitigating circumstances, *Re: Habitual Absenteeism of Mr. Fernando P. Pascual, A.M. No. 2005-16-SC*, *Re: Imposition of Corresponding Penalties for Habitual Tardiness Committed During the First and Second Semesters of 2003, A.M. No. 00-06-09-SC*, *Re: Administrative Case for Dishonesty Against Elizabeth Ting, Court Secretary I*, and *Almira v. B.F. Goodrich Philippines, Inc.*

**Mitigating Circumstances & Rationale for Reduced Penalty:**

*   Length of service (since 1994).
*   Health problems (acute gouty arthritis), supported by medical certificates.
*   Admission of infractions, remorse, and promise to reform.
*   Attempted applications for leave, albeit disapproved due to insufficient credits.
*   The court referenced the impact of the penalty on the employee's family (citing *Almira v. B.F. Goodrich Philippines, Inc.*).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prior Reprimand:** The fact that Abdon had a prior reprimand suggests a pattern of behavior, which could lead to harsher penalties in the future for any further infractions, as highlighted by the "stern warning" in the ruling.
*   **Ambiguity:** The decision uses relatively subjective criteria, like "remorse".
*   **Inconsistent application of law.** Normally a finding of guilt would require a suspension of six months and one day to one year. The court reduced the penalty to only one month.
