## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Leachon, Jr.*, G.R. Nos. 108725-26 (1998)

**Subject:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari and Mandamus challenging the dismissal of criminal cases for violation of P.D. 772 (Anti-Squatting Law).

**Key Provisions & Ruling:**

*   **Initial Dismissal & CA Reversal:** The RTC initially dismissed the cases *motu proprio* for lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering continuation of trial.
*   **Second Dismissal:** The RTC then dismissed the cases again *motu proprio*, arguing that P.D. 772 was rendered obsolete by Sections 9 and 10, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution regarding urban land reform and housing, particularly concerning eviction and demolition.
*   **SC Ruling on Constitutionality Argument:** The Supreme Court holds that the respondent judge did not err in so construing the aforecited constitutional provision, it ruled that the constitutional requirement that the eviction and demolition be in accordance with law and conducted in a just and humane manner does not mean that the validity or legality of the demolition or eviction is hinged on the existence of a resettlement area designated or earmarked by the government.
*   **SC Ruling on Procedural Issue:** The Court ruled that a constitutional question will not be decided unless it is properly raised in appropriate cases.
*   **Crucial Fact: Repeal of P.D. 772:** The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition because Republic Act No. 8368, repealing P.D. 772, was enacted during the pendency of the case. Section 3 of R.A. 8368 mandates the dismissal of all pending cases under P.D. 772.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent Judge:** The respondent judge was originally obligated to proceed with the trial based on the CA's order. This obligation was mooted by the repeal of P.D. 772.

**Liabilities:**

*   No specific liabilities are assigned in this ruling. The issue revolves around the propriety of the judge's dismissal orders.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mootness:** The repeal of P.D. 772 while the case was pending made the initial legal issues secondary.
*   **Constitutional Interpretation:** The SC's interpretation of Article XIII, Sections 9 and 10, emphasizes the importance of due process and humane treatment during evictions but clarifies that resettlement is not a *sine qua non* for lawful eviction. This provides guidance for future cases involving demolition and eviction but may still require case-by-case analysis.
*   **Motu Proprio Dismissal:** While the court acknowledged the importance of due process and the need for the constitutional question to be properly raised by a proper party, its ultimate decision was based on the mootness of the case because P.D. 772 was repealed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 772:** The central law at issue (Anti-Squatting Law), now repealed.
*   **Republic Act No. 8368:** The repealing act, which ultimately determined the outcome.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article XIII, Sections 9 & 10:** The constitutional provisions regarding urban land reform and housing, specifically concerning eviction and demolition.
*   **Relevant Case Law Cited:** *Misolas vs.Panga, Alvarez vs. Guingona, Jr., Lim vs. Pacquing* (Presumption of Constitutionality), *Napocor vs. Province of Lanao del Sur, Ty vs. Trampe* (Repeal by Implication), *Tropical Homes Inc. vs. National Housing Authority, Board of Optometry vs Colet* (Requisites to question Constitutionality).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses (Initially, before repeal):**

*   The core contentious issue was the interpretation of "in accordance with law and in a just and humane manner" within the context of Article XIII. The RTC's initial interpretation that it necessitated resettlement was ultimately rejected, clarifying the scope of the constitutional provision.
