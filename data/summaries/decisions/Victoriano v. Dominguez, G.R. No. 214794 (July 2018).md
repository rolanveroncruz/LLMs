## Legal Document Summary: *Victoriano v. Dominguez*

**Case:** *Narciso Victoriano v. Juniper Dominguez*, G.R. No. 214794, July 23, 2018

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions dismissing Victoriano's Petition for Review on technical grounds.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Victoriano purchased property from PNB, managed by Vasquez. Two deeds of sale were executed: one for Php 150,000 and another for Php 850,000.
*   Dominguez filed criminal and administrative complaints against Victoriano and Vasquez, alleging falsification of public documents to evade taxes.
*   OMB initially dismissed the complaint but later reversed its decision and found Victoriano guilty of Dishonesty, ordering his dismissal and the filing of a criminal information for Falsification under Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code against Victoriano and Vasquez.
*   CA dismissed Victoriano's Petition for Review on technical grounds.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Rule 43 vs. Substantial Justice:** Whether the CA erred in dismissing the petition based on technicalities, or whether the principle of substantial justice should prevail.
*   **Statement of Material Dates:** Adequacy of Victoriano's statement of material dates under Rule 43, Section 6, particularly in the context of *Capin-Cadiz v. Brent Hospital and Colleges, Inc.* (781 Phil. 610 (2016)) and related jurisprudence.
*   **Personal Service Explanation:** Requirement for explanation of failure to personally serve pleadings under Rule 13, Section 11, and potential exceptions as articulated in *Spouses Ello v. CA* (499 Phil. 398 (2005)) and *Peñoso v. Dona* (549 Phil. 39 (2007)).
*   **Verification Defect:** Sufficiency of verification based solely on personal knowledge versus requirement for "authentic records," citing *Hun Hyung Park v. Eung Won Choi* (553 Phil. 96 (2007)).
*   **Non-Forum Shopping Certificate:** Adequacy of the certification in light of the ruling in *Santos v. Litton Mills Incorporated* (667 Phil. 640 (2011)).
*   **Notarial Practice:** Compliance with A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC regarding competent evidence of identity before a notary public, and exceptions for personally known affiants citing *Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. v. Dela Cruz, et al.* (622 Phil. 886 (2009)) and *Reyes v. Glaucoma Research Foundation, Inc., et al.* (760 Phil. 779 (2015)).
*   **Counsel's Error:** Impact of counsel's inadvertence (omission of IBP number) on the client's case.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Victoriano:** Obligation to comply with procedural rules for appealing the OMB decision. Potential liability for Falsification under Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code and Dishonesty (administrative charge).
*   **Counsel:** Obligation to ensure pleadings comply with procedural rules.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Victoriano:** Dismissal from government service (although reversed by the Supreme Court) and potential criminal prosecution.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Statement of Material Dates" is ambiguous because while it follows the general principle, other dates may be required. The requirement of "true and correct to the best of my knowledge" leaves out the possible "authentic records."

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45, Revised Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Rule 43, Revised Rules of Court (Appeals from Quasi-Judicial Agencies to the CA)
*   Rule 13, Revised Rules of Court (Filing and Service of Pleadings)
*   Rule 7, Section 4, Revised Rules of Court (Verification of Pleadings)

*   *Spouses Ello v. CA*, 499 Phil. 398 (2005)
*   *Peñoso v. Dona*, 549 Phil. 39 (2007)
*   *Hun Hyung Park v. Eung Won Choi*, 553 Phil. 96 (2007)
*   *Santos v. Litton Mills Incorporated*, 667 Phil. 640 (2011)
*   *Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. v. Dela Cruz, et al.*, 622 Phil. 886 (2009)
*   *Reyes v. Glaucoma Research Foundation, Inc., et al.*, 760 Phil. 779 (2015)

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *GRANTED* Victoriano's Petition and *REMANDED* the case to the Court of Appeals for resolution on the merits. The SC held that the CA should have excused the technical defects due to the gravity of the case and because Victoriano had substantially complied with the Rules of Court. The court reminded the CA not to dismiss cases based on technicalities.

**Key takeaway** : There is substantial weight given to substantial compliance with rules of court, and that dismissal from government service warrants flexibility in technical compliance with court procedure.
