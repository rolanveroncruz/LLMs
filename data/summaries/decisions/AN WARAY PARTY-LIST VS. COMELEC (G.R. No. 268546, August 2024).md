Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision regarding An Waray Party-List:

**Case:** *An Waray Party-List vs. COMELEC, Pornias, and Acidre* (G.R. No. 268546, August 6, 2024)

**Issue:** Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC Resolutions cancelling An Waray's party-list registration. Key issues include: (1) COMELEC's jurisdiction vs. HRET's; (2) Grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC; (3) Violation of right to speedy disposition; and (4) Prescription of the action.

**Holding:** Petition dismissed. COMELEC did *not* commit grave abuse of discretion in cancelling An Waray's registration.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 7941 (Party-List System Act), Section 6:** COMELEC has the authority to refuse or cancel party-list registration for specific grounds, including violations of election laws.
*   **RA 7941, Section 13:** COMELEC is responsible for proclaiming party-list representatives.
*   **Constitution, Article IX-C, Section 2(5):** Grants COMELEC the power to register and potentially cancel registration of political parties and organizations.
*   **NBOC Resolution No. 13-030 (PL)/0004-14:** Established An Waray's entitlement to only one seat in the HoR after the 2013 elections, following the *BANAT* formula. An Waray's violation of this resolution formed a key basis for the cancellation.

**Liabilities:**

*   An Waray was found to have violated Section 6(5) of RA 7941 by allowing its second nominee (Victoria Isabel Noel) to assume office in the House of Representatives despite being entitled to only one seat and without valid COMELEC proclamation (contravening Section 13 of RA 7941 and NBOC Resolution No. 13-030 (PL)/0004-14).

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **RA 7941:** The core statute governing the party-list system. Critical sections are Section 6 (refusal/cancellation of registration) and Section 13 (proclamation of representatives).
*   **Constitution, Article VI, Section 17:** Establishes the jurisdiction of the HRET, which is the central point of contention.
*   **Constitution, Article IX-C, Section 2(5):** Grants COMELEC power to register/cancel registration.
*   ***Abang Lingkod Party-List v. COMELEC*:** Cited regarding untruthful statements in registration petitions.
*   ***BANAT v. COMELEC*:** Establishes the formula for party-list seat allocation.
*   ***Jalosjos v. COMELEC*:**  Reiterates COMELEC's duty to cancel COC of a candidate with a final judgment with accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.
*   ***Ty-Delgado v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal*:** Re moral turpitude and the disqualification of convicts to hold public office for five years after his or her service of sentence following Section 12 of the OEC
*   ***ABC (Alliance for Barangay Concerns) Party List v. COMELEC*:**  Discusses the distinction between the party-list and its nominee.  The nominee, not the party-list, becomes the HoR Member.
*   ***Javier v. COMELEC*:** Clarified the definition of "elections, returns, and qualifications" for HRET jurisdiction.
*   ***Vinzons-Chato v. COMELEC*:** Defines when COMELEC's jurisdiction ends and the HRET's begins (proclamation, oath, assumption of office).
*   ***COCOFED-Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. v. COMELEC*:** Defines that the laws, rules and regulations violated to warrant cancellation under Section 6(5) must be one that is primarily imputable to the party itself and not one that is chiefly confined to an individual member or its nominee.
*   ***Abayon v. HRET*:**  Reiterates that it is HRET that has jurisdiction over contests relating to their qualifications
*   ***Cagang v. Sandiganbayan*:**  Addresses right to speedy disposition.
*   ***Abella v. Commission on Audit Proper*:**  Addresses right to speedy disposition in administrative cases.
*   ***Dayao v. COMELEC*:**  Party-list law to a franchise granted by the Congress, that is not a right but merely a privilege that is conferred by the granting authority

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **HRET vs. COMELEC Jurisdiction:** The *most contentious issue*. While COMELEC clearly has power to cancel registrations, the key argument revolved around whether that power is ousted once the party-list's nominee is seated in the House. An Waray argued that Victoria's assumption of office, and the link to "returns" in Article VI, Section 17, shifted jurisdiction to the HRET. The Court rejected this, citing *ABC Party List v. COMELEC*, stating that the HRET's jurisdiction is limited to contests relating to the *individual* nominee's qualifications, not the party-list's registration itself.
*   **Right to Speedy Disposition:** An Waray argued a 4-year delay violated this right. The Court, citing the landmark case of Cagang v. Sandiganbayan ruled that An Waray had waived its right to speedy disposition of cases as it failed to raise the same in the four years that the case was pending with COMELEC; and the delay caused no actual prejudice to petitioners as even after the petition was filed and remained pending in 2019 and 2022, An Waray was still able to participate, and, in fact, was still able to win seats in the HoR in both election years.
*   **Prescription:** An Waray's argument that the action had prescribed under Section 267 of the Omnibus Election Code was rejected because that section only applies to *election offenses*.
*   **Reliance on NBOC Resolution No. 0008-13:**  An Waray's argument that they relied on the earlier NBOC Resolution (allocating two seats) was undermined by the later NBOC Resolution and the explicit language of the former being "without prejudice" to adjustments.

**In summary:**  The Supreme Court affirmed COMELEC's authority to cancel An Waray's registration, finding that An Waray violated election laws by allowing its second nominee to assume office without proper proclamation and beyond its allocated seat entitlement. The Court emphasized the distinction between the party-list organization and its nominee in determining HRET jurisdiction and held that An Waray's delay in raising its right to speedy disposition constituted a waiver. This decision highlights the importance of party-lists adhering to COMELEC seat allocations and properly securing proclamations for their nominees.
