## Legal Document Summary: *Kupers v. Hontanosas* (A.C. No. 5704)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution of the Supreme Court in an administrative case against Atty. Johnson B. Hontanosas.

**Key Issue:** Whether Atty. Hontanosas violated the Attorney's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility by preparing and notarizing lease agreements that contravened limitations on alien land leases.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complainant:** Willem Kupers.
*   **Respondent:** Atty. Johnson B. Hontanosas.
*   **Allegations:**
    *   Drafting and notarizing invalid/illegal lease agreements violating alien land lease limitations (P.D. No. 471).
    *   Conflict of interest (representing adverse parties).
    *   Refusal to furnish copies of notarized contracts.
    *   Notarizing documents without keeping copies.
    *   Failure to properly discharge duties to client Karl Novak (refusal to accept dismissal, failure to turn over documents, inadequate preparation, betrayal of trust).
*   **Specific Lease Agreements:** Two lease agreements drafted by Hontanosas for Spouses Busse (lessors) and Swiss/German nationals (lessees) Hochstrasser and Emberger, respectively. The lease periods (50 years renewable for 50 years and 49 years renewable for 49 years) exceeded the then-allowable limit for alien leases.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Argued that the contracts were valid under R.A. No. 7652 (Long-Term Lease of Private Lands by Foreign Investors) because they allowed for the nomination of a Filipino citizen or corporation to purchase the property.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Hontanosas:** Duty to uphold the laws of the Philippines (Attorney's Oath, Canon 1, Rule 1.02, Code of Professional Responsibility).
*   **Canon 15, Rule 15.07 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Requires lawyers to impress upon clients compliance with the laws and the principles of fairness.
*   **Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Requires a lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him.

**Legal Analysis & Case Law:**

*   **P.D. No. 471:** Limited leases of private lands to aliens to 25 years, renewable for another 25 years.
*   **R.A. No. 7652:** Allowed long-term leases of private lands by *foreign investors*. The court found R.A. No. 7652 inapplicable because the lease terms exceeded even the limits specified in that law (50 years, renewable for 25 years).
*   **Sec. 7 of R.A. No. 7652:** Imposes penalties for contracts violating its provisions, including lease periods exceeding the allowed limit.
*   **Sec. 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Allows for disbarment or suspension of attorneys for deceit, malpractice, gross misconduct, or violation of the Attorney's Oath.
*   **Cited case law:** Endaya v. Atty. OCA and Santiago v. Fojas.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Foreign Investor" Status:**  The Resolution assumes that the foreign nationals involved were considered as "foreign investors" which as per Section 5 (1) of RA 7652 states that Foreign individuals, corporations, associations, or partnerships not otherwise investing in the Philippines as defined herein shall continue to be covered by Presidential Decree No. 471 and other existing laws in lease of land to foreigners."

**Court's Ruling & Sanction:**

*   **Finding:** Atty. Hontanosas found guilty of violating the Attorney's Oath and gross misconduct for preparing and notarizing illegal lease contracts.
*   **Sanction:** Suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months, with a warning.

**Key Takeaways:**

The case underscores the duty of lawyers to ensure compliance with the law, especially when drafting legal documents. Even if a client desires a particular outcome, the lawyer cannot facilitate an agreement that patently violates legal restrictions. Ignorance or negligence is not an excuse, and drafting illegal agreements can lead to disciplinary action. This case highlights the importance of lawyers' due diligence in ensuring compliance with relevant laws.
