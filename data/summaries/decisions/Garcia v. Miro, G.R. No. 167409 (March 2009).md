**Legal Document Summary: *Garcia v. Miro, et al.*, G.R. No. 167409, March 20, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Prohibition seeking to nullify MCTC Orders denying the quashal of an Information for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide filed against the petitioner, a retired judge.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Incident:** Vehicular accident resulting in death of Francisco Ortega, Jr. (husband of complainant Julieta Ortega) involving a vehicle driven by Petitioner Garcia.
*   **Complaints:** Julieta Ortega filed a murder charge and administrative complaints (grave misconduct/abuse of authority) against Garcia with the Ombudsman-Visayas. The administrative complaint was referred to the OCA.
*   **Ombudsman's Actions:** The Ombudsman conducted a preliminary investigation and found probable cause for Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide.
*   **Information:** An Information was filed against Garcia with the MCTC, Calatrava-Toboso, Negros Occidental.
*   **Motion to Quash:** Garcia filed a Motion to Quash, arguing lack of jurisdiction and authority to file the Information, which was initially granted but then reconsidered and denied by the MCTC, leading to this petition.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The Supreme Court notes that the Petition was directly filed before them, disregarding the hierarchy of courts doctrine, but decided to entertain the case since it involves a pure question of law.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court **DENIED** the petition and ordered the MCTC to proceed with the trial.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts Doctrine:** Emphasized that petitions for extraordinary writs should initially be filed with the lower courts (RTC/CA).
*   **Jurisdiction of Ombudsman:**  The Court distinguished *Caoibes, Jr. v. Ombudsman* and *Fuentes v. Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao*, clarifying that those cases pertained to administrative matters related to judicial duties. In contrast, the present case involves a crime (Reckless Imprudence Resulting to Homicide) unrelated to the performance of the petitioner's judicial duties.
*   **MCTC Jurisdiction:** Reiterated that the MCTC has jurisdiction over offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) years under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by RA 7691.
*   **Compliance with *Caoibes*:** Confirmed that *Caoibes* was satisfied since the administrative aspect of the case was referred to the OCA (Administrative Matter OCA IPI No. 03-1403-MTJ, pending before the OCA) and that cases against judges are only referred to the Supreme Court when they are administrative cases.
*   **Trial Court Jurisdiction:** Trial courts retain jurisdiction over criminal cases.
**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Garcia faces potential criminal conviction and associated penalties.
*   **Collateral Estoppel:** A criminal conviction could potentially have implications for the pending administrative case.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinges on factual determinations regarding Garcia's recklessness and negligence in the operation of his vehicle.
*   **Due Process:** Fair trial and due process rights must be observed in MCTC proceedings.
*   **Pending Administrative Case:** The outcome of the administrative case at the OCA could impact Garcia's retirement benefits or legal standing.
