**Case Summary: *Binga Hydroelectric Plant, Inc. v. Commission on Audit and National Power Corporation***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 218721, July 10, 2018 (836 Phil. 46)

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied BHEPI's petition for review on certiorari, affirming the COA's denial of BHEPI's money claim for $5,000,000.00 and P40,118,442.79. The Court ruled that the Compromise Agreement between BHEPI and NPC was null and void because the authority to compromise claims exceeding P100,000.00 involving government agencies is vested exclusively in Congress, per Section 20(1), Chapter IV, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of Executive Order (EO) No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), superseding Section 36 of PD No. 1445.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Settlement Framework Agreement (SFA):**  Agreement between BHEPI, NPC, and PSALM for resolution of disputes related to the Rehabilitate-Operate-Leaseback (ROL) Contract. NPC was to pay BHEPI $5,000,000.00, contingent on settlement of subcontractors' and employees' claims with quitclaims.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** Agreement between BHEPI and NPC, where NPC agreed to pay $5,000,000.00 (for subcontractor/employee claims) and P40,118,442.79 (savings). Approved by the CA.
*   **EO 292, Section 20(1):**  Vests exclusive authority in Congress to compromise claims exceeding P100,000.00 involving government agencies. Requires recommendation from the COA and the President to Congress.
*   **PD 1445, Section 36:** States that respective governing bodies of GOCC's have the exclusive power to compromise when authorized by their charters, superseded by EO 292 Sec 20(1).
*   **EPIRA, Sections 49 and 56:** Created PSALM, transferring existing NPC generation assets, liabilities, independent power producer contracts, real estate and all other disposable assets to PSALM.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Compromise Agreement:** The core liability of NPC under the Compromise Agreement is unenforceable without Congressional approval.
*   **PSALM's Role:** PSALM's assumption of NPC's liabilities under EPIRA makes PSALM a necessary party to any settlement agreement. PSALM's lack of participation in the Compromise Agreement raises questions about its validity.
*   **COA's Audit Authority:**  COA retains authority to examine and settle government claims, even after court judgment.  BHEPI must seek COA approval before payment.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The arrangement where BHEPI receives 50% of the savings generated from reducing subcontractor/employee claims is considered improper and a potential form of unjust enrichment.
*   **Lack of Substantiation:** BHEPI failed to provide sufficient documentation to substantiate its claim and the services rendered under the ROL contract, raising doubt with the COA.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The petition to the Supreme Court was filed out of time.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Strategic Alliance Development Corporation v. Radstock Securities Limited (G.R. No. 178158):**  Established that EO 292 supersedes PD 1445 regarding compromise authority for government agencies and GOCCs.
*   **Benedicto v. The Board of Administrators of Television Stations RPN, BBC and IBC (G.R. No. 87710)** Cited in Strategic, held that mandatory congressional approval of the compromise is only for claims that are already settled.
*   **Euro-Med Laboratories, Phil., Inc. v. The Province of Batangas, G.R. No. 148106** Defined the concept of settled claim or liability to take cognizance only to claims that are liquidated and uncontested.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines):** Section 36
*   **Executive Order (EO) No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Section 20(1)
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9136 (Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 - EPIRA):** Sections 49 and 56

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The validity and enforceability of the Compromise Agreement absent congressional approval.
*   BHEPI's claim to 50% of the savings generated from the reduction of the claims of subcontractors and employees, which the COA deemed unjust enrichment.
*   The definition and scope of a "settled claim" under EO 292, particularly in light of the CA judgment.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case involves a petition by BHEPI challenging the COA's denial of a money claim based on a Compromise Agreement with NPC. The Supreme Court upheld the COA's decision, finding the agreement void because it required Congressional approval under EO 292, given the claim's size. The key issue is whether NPC could validly compromise the claim without Congressional approval. The Court also scrutinized PSALM's role (as the entity assuming NPC's liabilities), the substantiation of BHEPI's claims, and the propriety of the "savings" arrangement. Significant risks include unenforceability of the Compromise Agreement and potential liability for unjust enrichment. The case clarifies the limits on GOCCs' authority to compromise claims and underscores the COA's oversight role.
