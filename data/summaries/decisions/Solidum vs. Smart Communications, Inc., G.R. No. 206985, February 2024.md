## Legal Document Summary: Solidum vs. Smart Communications

**Case:** G.R. No. 206985, February 28, 2024

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Jose Leni Z. Solidum (Employee)
*   **Respondents:** Smart Communications, Inc., Napoleon L. Nazareno, and Ricardo P. Isla (Employer)

**Nature:** Petition for Partial Review on Certiorari seeking to annul the Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions ordering Solidum to refund Smart the additional wages and benefits received via the 10th Alias Writ of Execution.

**Background:**

*   Solidum filed an illegal dismissal case (NLRC Case No. NCR-00-11-09564-05) against Smart.
*   Labor Arbiter (LA) initially ruled in favor of Solidum, ordering reinstatement with backwages and benefits.
*   Smart appealed to the NLRC.
*   NLRC initially denied Smart's appeal but later granted reconsideration and dismissed Solidum's complaint, reversing the LA's decision. This NLRC decision became final on August 10, 2009.
*   During the appeal process, multiple alias writs of execution were issued for accrued reinstatement wages.
*   Ultimately, Solidum received amounts under the 8th, 9th, and 10th Alias Writs.
*   The CA initially nullified the NLRC's orders granting Solidum's appeal but later partially granted Solidum's Motion for Reconsideration, but ordered the return of the additional wages and benefits he received by virtue of the 10th Alias Writ.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Main Issue:** Whether the CA erred in ordering Solidum to refund the PHP 15,889,871.04 received under the 10th Alias Writ, covering wages and benefits accrued *before* the finality of the NLRC's reversal of the LA's decision (before August 10, 2009).
*   **Reinstatement Order:** The LA's reinstatement order was immediately executory pending appeal (Art. 229 of the Labor Code, as renumbered in 2015; previously Art. 223). Employer has option of actual or payroll reinstatement.
*   **"Refund Doctrine" & Two-Fold Test:** The CA ordered the refund based on a perceived delay by Solidum in claiming additional benefits. The Supreme Court (SC) analyzes this under the two-fold test regarding whether the failure to execute the reinstatement pending appeal was due to actual delay and employer fault, as outlined in *Bergonio, Jr., v. South East Asian Airlines*.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** Employer is obligated to reinstate (actually or on payroll) and compensate the dismissed employee during appeal, until reversal by a higher court.  Failure to comply with reinstatement order results in liability for accrued salaries.
*   **Delay:** The SC clarified that "delay" in the context of the Two-Fold Test refers to an *unjustifiable delay on the part of the employer* in complying with the labor arbiter's reinstatement order before its reversal, not any delay of the employee in later claiming accrued wages. *Garcia v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.*, highlights the impracticality of forcing employees to refund wages already spent to survive.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 229 (previously 223):**  Deals with the immediately executory nature of reinstatement orders.
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure (2005 & 2011):**  Outline the procedures for appeals and execution of decisions.
*   ***Bergonio, Jr., v. South East Asian Airlines,*** **733 Phil. 347 (2014):** Establishes the two-fold test for determining whether an employee is barred from collecting accrued wages when a reinstatement order is reversed on appeal.
*   ***Garcia v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.,*** **596 Phil. 510 (2009):** Explains the impracticality of the "refund doctrine."
*   ***Smart Communications, Inc. v. Solidum,*** **758 Phil. 211 (2015):** The case previously between the parties where the SC already ruled Solidum was entitled to some accrued benefits.

**SC Ruling:**

*   The SC *granted* Solidum's petition.  The CA's Resolutions ordering the refund of the PHP 15,889,871.04 were reversed and set aside.
*   The SC held that the CA misapplied the Two-Fold Test.
*   The SC found that Smart's *unjustified actions* caused the delay in Solidum's reinstatement.  Smart filed motions to quash alias writs instead of complying with the reinstatement order and failed to submit a compliance report (as required by the 2005 NLRC Rules of Procedure, Section 14, Rule V and Section 6, Rule XI).
*   Therefore, Solidum was entitled to the wages and benefits accrued *before* the finality of the NLRC's reversal (before August 10, 2009).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Finality of Arbiter's Order Approving Computation:** The SC acknowledged but did not disturb the final and executory status of the arbiter's April 25, 2012 Order approving the computation of PHP 15,889,871.04. This highlights the importance of challenging such orders in a timely manner.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The case involved factual disputes regarding compliance with the reinstatement order and the cause of delays.
*   **Reliance on Certification:**  The SC relied on the NLRC's certification that Smart never submitted a compliance report, which suggests that absence of evidence of an action is proof of inaction. Smart's lack of record keeping could be a point of potential vulnerability.

**Conclusion:**

The SC ruling emphasizes the employer's immediate obligation to comply with reinstatement orders pending appeal and reinforces the protection afforded to labor under the law. It clarifies the "delay" concept in the Two-Fold Test, focusing on employer culpability. Smart is liable for Solidum's accrued wages and benefits earned before the final reversal, and the refund order was erroneous.
