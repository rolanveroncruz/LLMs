## Legal Document Summary: CIR vs. Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership (M2GP)

**Case:** G.R. No. 253003, January 24, 2024

**Subject:** Petition for Review of CTA En Banc Decision granting M2GP's claim for VAT refund or issuance of Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) for Taxable Year 2008.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 112(A) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended by RA 8424:**  Governs VAT refunds or TCC issuance for zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales.  M2GP claims entitlement under this provision.
*   **Section 110 NIRC:** Defines creditable input tax and the transactions that generate it.
*   **Build-Operate-Transfer Contract:** M2GP's agreement with PNOC-EDC for geothermal power plant operation.

**Issue:** Whether input tax must be directly attributable to zero-rated sales to qualify for a VAT refund or TCC.

**Holding:** Supreme Court DENIED the CIR's petition, affirming the CTA En Banc's decision in favor of M2GP.  The Court held that direct attributability is *not* an absolute requirement under Section 112(A) of the NIRC.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **CIR (Petitioner):**  Challenging the CTA's grant of the refund based on a misinterpretation of the direct attributability requirement.
*   **M2GP (Respondent):** Claiming refund of unutilized input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Direct Attributability" Requirement:**  The main point of contention. The CIR argued for strict direct attributability based on *Atlas Consolidated Mining* cases. The Court clarified that *Atlas Consolidated Mining* relied on older Revenue Regulations (RR Nos. 5-87 and 3-88) which were superseded by RR No. 14-2005 and subsequent issuances.  These newer RRs do not impose the same stringent direct attributability requirement.  The Court stated that the law requires that creditable input VAT should be attributable to the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales, implying it must be regarded as being caused by such sales.

**Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Sections 112(A) and 110 are central to the issue.
*   **Republic Act No. 8424 (Tax Reform Act of 1997):** Amended the NIRC.
*   **Republic Act No. 9337 (VAT Reform Act of 2005):** Lead to revocation of previous VAT regulations.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. CIR*** (2007 and 2011 cases): CIR's primary support.  The Supreme Court distinguished these cases as having been decided under different Revenue Regulations.
*   ***San Roque Power Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue***:  Clarified that only final decisions of the Supreme Court are binding precedents, not CTA decisions.
*   **Mindanao II Geothermal Partnership v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 749 Phil. 485 (2014):**  Earlier Supreme Court decision remanding the case to the CTA Second Division.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **CIR:**  Direct attributability is required; M2GP failed to prove this.  Relied heavily on *Atlas Consolidated Mining*.
*   **M2GP:** Complied with Section 112(A) and established attributability; *Atlas Consolidated Mining* is inapplicable due to changes in regulations.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with M2GP, rejecting the CIR's argument for strict direct attributability. This decision clarifies the requirements for VAT refund claims related to zero-rated sales under the current tax regime. The Court found that Section 112(A) of the Tax Code does not absolutely require that input taxes subject of a refund/TCC claim be directly attributable to zero-rated sales.
