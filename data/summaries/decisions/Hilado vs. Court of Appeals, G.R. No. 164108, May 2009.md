**Legal Document Summary: Hilado v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 164108 (May 8, 2009)**

**Nature:** Decision concerning intervention in intestate proceedings.

**Facts:** Petitioners (Hilado, Lopez Sugar, First Farmers) are creditors of the deceased Roberto Benedicto, based on pending tort claims in separate civil cases (Civil Case No. 95-9137 and Civil Case No. 11178). Respondent Julita Benedicto, the administratrix of Benedicto's estate, initiated intestate proceedings in Manila RTC. Petitioners sought to intervene, demanding copies of all court processes, a deadline for inventory submission, and a deadline for annual accounting, including examination under oath, with notice to all interested parties. The lower courts denied intervention, finding petitioners' claims contingent.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Intervention (Rule 19):**  The Court affirmed the CA decision that the petitioners cannot intervene under Rule 19 because their claims are contingent. Case law ( *Batama Farmers' Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc., et al., v. Hon. Rosal, etc. et al., 149 Phil. 514, 519 (1971)*) dictates that the legal interest of the intervenor must be actual, material, direct, and immediate, not contingent and expectant.
*   **Special Proceedings (Rule 72):** While Rule 72 allows the application of ordinary rules in special proceedings, Rule 19 does not extend to creditors with contingent claims.
*   **Rights as "Interested Persons":**  Despite the denial of formal intervention, the Court held that Petitioners, as "persons interested in the estate," are entitled to specific rights under the Rules on Special Proceedings and have viable interest in the estate:
    *   **Access to Court Records (Rule 135, Sec. 2):** Petitioners are deemed "interested persons" entitled to access court records related to the intestate proceedings (*Hilado v. Judge Reyes, G.R. No. 163155, 21 July 2006*).
    *   **Notice of Specific Proceedings:** Entitled to notices concerning the time and place of examining and allowing the account of the executor/administrator (Sec. 10, Rule 85), petitions to authorize the sale/mortgage of estate property (Sec. 7(b), Rule 89), and hearings for orders of distribution of estate residue (Sec. 1, Rule 90). The Court considered the acknowledgment of the pending civil cases filed by the petitioners, as evidenced by the Administratrix's submission of the inventory.
*   **Claims Based on Tort:**  The Court distinguished between contractual claims, which must be filed as claims against the estate under Rule 86, and tort claims, which survive the decedent's death and may be brought against the administrator under Rule 87 (*Aguas v. Llemos, et al., 116 Phil. 112 (1962); Leung Ben v. O'Brien, 38 Phil. 182, 189-194 (1918)*).
*   **Inventory and Accounting Deadlines:** Petitioners' request for court-ordered deadlines for inventory and accounting was denied.  The Court held that a person with a contingent claim against the estate is not entitled to compel the administrator to perform those duties.

**Obligations:**

*   **Administratrix:**  Obligated to provide notice to Petitioners regarding examinations/allowances of accounts, petitions to sell/encumber property, and hearings for distribution of estate residue.
*   **Petitioners:** Must actively monitor court records to protect their interests.

**Liabilities:**

*   Estate remains liable for Petitioners' pending tort claims, contingent upon favorable judgments in the separate civil cases.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **"Interested Person" Definition:** The practical implications of being an "interested person" solely for record access and limited notices could be litigated further, especially if the administratrix obstructs access or fails to provide adequate notice.
*   **Enforcement of Contingent Claims:** If the estate is distributed before the resolution of the pending civil cases, Petitioners may face difficulties enforcing their judgments. They could potentially seek the removal of the administrator under Rule 82, Section 2 if the administrator is dissipating assets.
*   **Impact of *Dinglasan v. Ang Chia*:** The Court cited *Dinglasan v. Ang Chia* as basis but clarified that Petitioners are only allowed to seek certain prayers or reliefs if the prayer or relief sought is necessary to protect their interest in the estate, and there is no other modality under the Rules by which such interests can be protected.

**Case Law:**
