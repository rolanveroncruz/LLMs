## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Raul T. Manzano, et al.* (G.R. No. 188243, January 24, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming a Special Agrarian Court's (SAC) determination of just compensation for land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction over Just Compensation:** The Supreme Court (SC) reiterates that the SAC has **original and exclusive jurisdiction** over the final determination of just compensation. This jurisdiction cannot be curtailed or limited by legislation or administrative rule. *Association of Small Landowners* is clarified to mean the SAC makes an original determination, not merely a review of DAR's valuation. *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Montalvan* solidifies this exclusive jurisdiction.
*   **Due Process:** The SC finds that Landbank (LBP) *was not deprived* of due process as it had ample opportunity to present its case, file position papers, and comment on the commissioner's report. A formal hearing is not always mandatory, referencing *National Power Corporation v. Spouses Chiong*.
*   **Determination of Just Compensation:** While Section 17 of RA 6657 and related administrative orders provide guideposts (*Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim*), the SAC is **not strictly bound** by the DAR formulas. The SAC must consider the factors, but it can deviate with a reasoned explanation, as established in *Alfonso v. Land Bank*. Focus is on fair market value at the time of taking, per *National Power Corporation v. Spouses Ileto*. *Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank* stipulates that this value is impacted by income-generating potential.
*   **Execution Pending Appeal:** The SC upholds the execution pending appeal based on "good reasons": (1) the landowners have been deprived of their land since 1999 without just compensation, violating their constitutional rights; and (2) the government's belated payment warrants prompt compensation. 65% of payment in bonds necessitates the decision to be made as soon as possible. Landowners are willing to return the amount should modifications be made. This aligns with *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Orilla.*
*   **Legal Interest:** The SC affirms the imposition of legal interest to compensate for the delay in payment, citing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lajom* and *Apo Fruits v. Land Bank of the Philippines*.  The interest is deemed damages for the delay. Cites *Republic v. Court of Appeals*. Modifies the interest rate to 12% per annum from the time of taking until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until fully paid, per *Nacar v. Gallery Frames.*
*   **Statutory References:** Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law), Section 17 (Factors for determining just compensation), Section 57 (Jurisdiction of SACs); Administrative Order No. 05-98; Joint Memorandum Circular No. 07-99; Rule 39, Section 2(a) of the Rules of Court; Rule 67, Section 7 of the Rules of Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP):** Obligated to pay the determined just compensation, subject to the modified interest rates. Liable for the delay in payment. The amounts already withdrawn by respondents must be subtracted from the final amount in the judgment on which the legal interest should be imposed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Discrepancies:**  The varying valuations throughout the proceedings (LBP's initial offer, revaluation, landowners' claims, commissioner's report) highlight the difficulty in determining "fair market value," even with Section 17 and relevant administrative guidelines.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Although execution pending appeal was upheld, future challenges in enforcing the judgment are possible, given LBP's initial resistance and the inherent complexities of land valuation cases.
*   **Future Interest Rate Changes:** The SC's modification of the legal interest rate based on *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* creates the possibility of future adjustments in interest rates depending on Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) regulations.

**Conclusion:** The SC upheld the SAC's determination of just compensation but modified the legal interest rate. The case clarifies the SAC's exclusive jurisdiction in determining just compensation.
