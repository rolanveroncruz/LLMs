## Legal Document Summary: Allied Banking Corporation v. Reynold Calumpang (G.R. No. 219435)

**Subject:** Illegal Dismissal Complaint

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Allied Banking Corporation (now merged with Philippine National Bank)
*   **Respondent:** Reynold Calumpang

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) partly granted the petition, affirming the finding of an employer-employee relationship between Allied Bank and Calumpang but modifying the CA decision by deleting the award of backwages and separation pay and awarding only nominal damages. While the SC determined the employee dismissal to be for valid cause it did not follow procedural due process.

**Facts:** Calumpang, a janitor assigned to Allied Bank through a service agreement with Race Cleaners, Inc. (RCI), was terminated after the bank discovered he was using work hours to drive a pedicab and borrowing money from bank clients. Calumpang filed an illegal dismissal case. The Labor Arbiter (LA), NLRC, and CA all found in favor of Calumpang, declaring him illegally dismissed and ordering reinstatement with backwages or separation pay.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Service Agreement:** Allied Bank had a service agreement with RCI to provide janitorial services. The agreement contained a clause disclaiming an employer-employee relationship between the bank and RCI employees, which was ultimately disregarded by the Supreme Court.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The SC affirmed the CA ruling that RCI was a labor-only contractor under Article 106 of the Labor Code. Allied Bank failed to prove RCI had substantial capital, investment, tools, etc. This finding established Allied Bank as the real employer.
*   **Just Cause for Termination:** The SC reversed the lower courts, finding that Allied Bank had just cause to terminate Calumpang's employment based on his misconduct (plying pedicab during work hours, borrowing money from clients), citing conduct prejudicial to the employer's interest. Respondent did not deny the accusations against him.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** The SC agreed with the CA that Allied Bank violated Calumpang's right to procedural due process by failing to provide the required notices (notice to explain and notice of termination).
*   **Remedies:** Because the dismissal was for valid cause, reinstatement and backwages were denied. However, Allied Bank was ordered to pay nominal damages (P30,000) for the procedural due process violation, relying on jurisprudence like *Libcap Marketing Corp. v. Baquial* and *Deoferio v. Intel Technology Philippines, Inc.*.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 106:** Defines contractor/subcontractor relationships and labor-only contracting.
*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, Sections 8 and 9:** Elaborate on job contracting vs. labor-only contracting.
*   **King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac:** Sets out procedural due process requirements for terminations.

**Case Law:**

*   **Sasan, Sr. v. NLRC:**  Cited for the general rule that a contractor is presumed to be a labor-only contractor.
*   **Diamond Farms, Inc. v. Southern Philippines Federation of Labor (SPFL):** Cited to show that a finding that a contractor is a labor-only contractor equates to declaring that there is an employer-employee relationship between the principal and the employees of the supposed contractor.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof:**  The case reinforces the burden of proof on the employer to prove that a contractor is a legitimate job contractor.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** This case serves as a stark reminder for employers to rigorously adhere to procedural due process requirements in terminations, even when just cause exists. Failure to do so can result in significant liability, even if limited to nominal damages.
*   **Lack of Denial:**  The Court notes the lack of a denial by the employee, which led it to consider the accusations were valid and legal grounds.

**Conclusion:**

Allied Bank successfully defended the substantive validity of the termination, avoiding significant monetary liability. However, it was still held liable for nominal damages due to its failure to comply with procedural due process requirements. This emphasizes the importance of adhering to the "twin-notice rule" (notice to explain and notice of termination) in all termination cases, regardless of the perceived strength of the just cause. The determination that RCI was a labor-only contractor is a critical point, establishing Allied Bank as the true employer and thus responsible for labor law compliance with respect to Calumpang.
