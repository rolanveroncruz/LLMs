## Legal Document Summary: *Seaoil Petroleum Corporation vs. Autocorp Group and Paul Y. Rodriguez* (G.R. No. 164326)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in favor of Autocorp Group in a Complaint for Recovery of Personal Property with Damages and Replevin.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Sale:** The core issue is the sale of an excavator by Autocorp to Seaoil, evidenced by Vehicle Sales Invoice No. A-0209 and Vehicle Sales Confirmation No. 258.
*   **Payment Terms:** The purchase price was payable in 12 monthly installments, secured by postdated checks issued by Seaoil.
*   **Retention of Title:** The sales invoice stipulated that ownership remained with Autocorp until full payment.
*   **Default:** Seaoil stopped payment on 10 checks, leading to Autocorp's legal action.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Seaoil:** Held liable for the unpaid balance of the purchase price (P2,389,179.23 plus 3% interest) and attorney's fees (25% of the total amount due).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** Seaoil attempted to introduce evidence of an alleged agreement involving Uniline (owned by Rodriguez) and Focus Point International (owned by Yu of Seaoil) to settle a debt, arguing the invoice didn't reflect the true agreement. This argument failed due to the parol evidence rule (Rule 130, Section 9, Revised Rules on Evidence) and lack of clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate that the Sales Invoice did not reflect the true agreement, or that fraud or mistake existed.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Seaoil argued that Autocorp's corporate veil should be pierced to hold Rodriguez liable as the owner of Uniline, alleging the transaction was structured to defraud Focus Point. The court rejected this, citing the separate legal personalities of Autocorp and Uniline, and the absence of evidence to show Autocorp was an alter ego used to perpetrate fraud (citing *Philippine National Bank v. Ritrato Group, Inc.*, 414 Phil. 494 (2001)).
*   **Third-Party Complaint:** Dismissal of the third-party complaint against Rodriguez was affirmed, as he wasn't a party to the sale of the excavator. This dismissal operates as res judicata on the issue of Rodriguez's liability.
*   **Replevin:** Seaoil challenged Autocorp's right to replevin based on an alleged transfer of ownership to Focus Point. This was rejected because Focus Point was not a party to the sales contract and ownership remained with Autocorp until full payment as stated in the Vehicle Sales Invoice.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governing Petitions for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Rule 130, Section 9, Revised Rules on Evidence (Parol Evidence Rule):**  Additions to, or contradictions of, the terms of a written agreement by testimony or other evidence are forbidden if they are purporting to show that different terms were agreed upon by the parties, varying the purport of the written contract.
*   **Section 31, Corporation Code:** Liability of directors for unlawful acts, gross negligence, or bad faith.
*   **Rule 6, Section 11, Revised Rules on Civil Procedure:** Defines a third-party complaint.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, affirming Seaoil's liability for the unpaid purchase price of the excavator. The court rejected Seaoil's arguments based on the parol evidence rule, piercing the corporate veil, and challenges to Autocorp's right to replevin. The ruling emphasizes the binding nature of commercial documents like sales invoices and the importance of clear and convincing evidence to overcome contractual terms and establish fraud or wrongdoing. The dismissal of the third-party complaint against Rodriguez bars future claims against him based on the same cause of action.
