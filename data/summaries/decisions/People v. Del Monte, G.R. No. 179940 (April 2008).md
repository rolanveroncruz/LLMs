## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Del Monte* (G.R. No. 179940)

**Case:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically illegal sale of *shabu*.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165:** Penalizes the sale, trading, delivery, etc. of dangerous drugs with life imprisonment to death and a fine of P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00.

*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165:** Outlines the procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs, requiring immediate inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, media, DOJ, and an elected public official.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-appellant Del Monte was convicted by the RTC for selling 0.290 gram of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer (PO1 Tolentino) in a buy-bust operation.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but reduced the fine from P5,000,000.00 to P500,000.00.
*   Del Monte appeals, alleging non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Issues and Analysis:**

*   **Failure to comply with Section 21, R.A. 9165:**
    *   The Court held that the appellant raised this issue for the first time on appeal.
    *   Relying on *People v. Sta. Maria* (G.R. No. 171019), the Court stated that objections to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.
    *   Following *People v. Pringas* (G.R. No. 175928), non-compliance with Section 21 does not render an arrest illegal or the evidence inadmissible, as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.
    *   The Court noted that the Appellant stipulated to the fact that the substance subject of the case was examined and the result was positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.
    *   The Court stated that the issue in the case of non-compliance with said section is not of admissibility, but of evidentiary weight or probative value.
    *   The Court ruled that the elements of illegal sale of drugs were proven beyond reasonable doubt.

*   **Defense of Frame-up:**
    *   The Court rejected the defense of frame-up, stating that it is easily contrived and difficult to disprove.
    *   Appellant failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that government officials performed their duties regularly, as required by *People v. Zheng Bai Hui* (393 Phil. 68).
    *   The Court noted inconsistencies in the testimonies of the defense witnesses.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Affirmed conviction:** Del Monte faces life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
