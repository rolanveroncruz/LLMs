## Legal Document Summary: *Victory Liner, Inc. vs. Pablo Race* (G.R. No. 164820)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration concerning an illegal dismissal case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Finding of Illegal Dismissal:** Affirms the illegal dismissal of respondent, Pablo Race (bus driver), due to failure to comply with substantive and procedural due process.
*   **Denial of Reinstatement:** Denies reinstatement due to respondent's leg injury sustained in an accident rendering him incapable of driving a bus.
*   **Separation Pay:** Orders payment of separation pay of one month's pay for every year of service.
*   **Limited Backwages:** Modifies the original decision to award *limited* backwages for five years (January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2002), inclusive of allowances and benefits.
*   **Rejection of New Argument:** Rejects petitioner's (Victory Liner) attempt to invoke Article 284 of the Labor Code (termination due to disease) as justification for dismissal, as it was raised for the first time in the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Obligations:**

*   Victory Liner is obligated to pay Pablo Race separation pay (1 month salary per year of service).
*   Victory Liner is obligated to pay limited backwages from Jan 1 1998 to Dec 31 2002

**Liabilities:**

*   Victory Liner is liable for illegal dismissal and associated monetary consequences despite the mitigating factor of good faith.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Litigation:** While the backwages were limited, the liability for illegal dismissal is still established.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 279, Labor Code:** General rule regarding reinstatement and full backwages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Article 284, Labor Code:** Termination due to disease/health reasons; rejected as a basis for termination in this case due to being raised late.
*   **Article 1733, Civil Code:** Common carriers' duty to observe extraordinary diligence.
*   ***Agabon v. NLRC*** **(G.R. No. 158693):** Establishes principle that valid cause for dismissal but lack of due process warrants nominal damages, not full backwages.
*   ***San Miguel Corporation v. Javate, Jr*** **(G.R. No. 54244):** Mitigating circumstances (good faith) in illegal dismissal can limit backwages.
*   ***Dolores v. NLRC*** **(G.R. No. 87673):** Illegality of dismissal may still be found even with misconduct but with mitigating factors.
*   ***Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. v. NLRC***: Illegality of dismissal may still be found even with misconduct but with mitigating factors.
*   ***San Miguel Corporation v. Secretary of Labor***: Illegality of dismissal may still be found even with misconduct but with mitigating factors.
*   ***Manila Electric Company v. NLRC***: Illegality of dismissal may still be found even with misconduct but with mitigating factors.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith" Determination:** The court's attribution of "good faith" to Victory Liner is crucial in limiting backwages, but could be subject to scrutiny as the initial reasons for dismissal (abandonment, insubordination) were deemed unsubstantiated.
*   **Limited Backwages:** The specific five-year period for backwages appears somewhat arbitrary and could be challenged. The separation pay is to be computed until the finality of the decision.
