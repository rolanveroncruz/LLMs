**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ting and Garcia* (G.R. No. 221505)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's affirmation of the RTC's grant of a Demurrer to Evidence, resulting in acquittal of respondents Ting (City Mayor) and Garcia (City Treasurer) for violation of Section 261(w)(b) of the Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 261(w)(b), Omnibus Election Code:** Prohibits the issuance, use, or availment of treasury warrants or any device undertaking future delivery of money, goods, or other things of value chargeable against public funds during the 45-day period preceding a regular election.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), Sec. 191:** Defines "issue" as the first delivery of a complete instrument to a holder.  The lower courts incorrectly focused on the NIL definition, which does not apply here.
*   **Rules on Notarial Practice, Sections 2 and 6:** States that notary public must be sure that a person appeared before him, presented a document, and affirmed the contents thereof.

**Alleged Violation & Facts:**

*   Respondents issued a treasury warrant dated April 30, 2004 (within the 45-day election ban) to pay for land purchased for a public cemetery. The warrant was for P8,486,027.00. The warrant was encashed on May 18, 2004, outside the election ban.
*   The deed of sale was notarized on May 5, 2004.
*   New TCTs were issued in the name of the city government on May 5, 2004.

**Lower Court Rulings & Reasoning:**

*   **RTC:** Granted Demurrer to Evidence, acquitted respondents. Reasoned that the prosecution failed to prove delivery of the warrant within the prohibited period. Relied on the NIL and date of encashment (May 18, 2004) being outside the ban. Also argued that the title transfer does not necessarily mean payment happened the same day.
*   **CA:** Affirmed RTC. Agreed with RTC's reliance on the NIL and lack of proof of delivery within the prohibited period. Held that the date of notarization is not the date of issuance.

**Petitioner's (People) Argument:**

*   The prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt the violation of Section 261(w)(b) of the Omnibus Election Code.  Argued that the RTC incorrectly focused on the technical definition of "issue" under the NIL.

**Supreme Court Analysis and Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court found the RTC *should not* have granted the demurrer.
*   **Section 261(w)(b) Violation:** The SC argues that the RTC misinterpreted the law. The court states that a person who "issues, uses or avails" of treasury warrants or devices commits the offense. Actual payment of the purchase price is not an element of the crime.
*   **"Issue" Defined Broadly:** The SC held that the term "issue" under the subject provision should not be construed in its restricted sense within the meaning of Negotiable Instruments Law, but rather in its general meaning to give, to send, or such other words importing delivery to the proper person.
*   **Prima Facie Evidence:** The date on the warrant (April 30, 2004) created a *prima facie* presumption of delivery on that date. The notarized deed of sale on May 5, 2004, further supported delivery before that date.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** Despite finding that the lower courts erred, the SC *denied* the petition due to the principle of *double jeopardy*.  The RTC's grant of the demurrer was effectively an acquittal. The OSG failed to demonstrate grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the part of the RTC. There was no denial of due process to the prosecution.

**Potential Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Double Jeopardy Barrier:** The most significant risk is the constitutional bar against double jeopardy. The acquittal is final unless it can be shown that the RTC acted with grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Ambiguity in "Issue":** While the SC clarified the meaning of "issue" for purposes of this particular law, ambiguity could arise in future cases applying similar language.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881), Section 261(w)(b):** The central statutory provision.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL):** Incorrectly relied upon by lower courts for the definition of "issue."
*   *Guzman v. COMELEC*, 614 Phil. 143 (2009): Mandated filing of criminal information against respondents.
*   *People v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 205182-83, August 5, 2013 (Minute Resolution, Second Division).
*   *Asistio v. People, et al.*, 758 Phil. 485 (2015).
*   Rules on Notarial Practice, Sections 2 and 6.

**Conclusion:**

While the Supreme Court found legal errors in the lower courts' interpretation of Section 261(w)(b) of the Omnibus Election Code, it ultimately upheld the acquittal of the respondents due to the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The Court's interpretation of "issue" in this context broadens the scope of the prohibited act beyond the technical definition in the NIL.
