## Legal Document Summary: Nippon Express (Philippines) Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 191495)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc decision denying Nippon Express' (Nippon) claim for refund of excess/unutilized input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales for taxable year 2004.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CTA had jurisdiction over the judicial claim for refund, and whether sales invoices are sufficient to substantiate zero-rated sales of services under Section 112 of the NIRC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, vacating and setting aside the CTA decisions due to lack of jurisdiction. The judicial claim was filed beyond the 30-day appeal period from the deemed denial of the administrative claim. Despite the jurisdictional issue, the SC clarified the need for VAT official receipts to substantiate zero-rated sales of services.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 112 NIRC (prior to amendments by RA 9337 and RA 9361):** Governs refunds or tax credits of input VAT.
    *   Requires VAT-registered persons with zero-rated sales to apply for a Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) or refund within two (2) years after the close of the taxable quarter.
    *   Gives the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) 120 days to decide on the application, and allows the taxpayer 30 days from receipt of denial (or deemed denial due to inaction) to appeal to the CTA.
*   **Sections 113 and 237 NIRC:** Invoicing and accounting requirements.
    *   Requires VAT-registered persons to issue invoices or receipts for every sale.
    *   The SC interprets these sections, in conjunction with Sections 106 and 108, to mandate *VAT official receipts* for sales of services and *VAT invoices* for sales of goods/properties for substantiation of VAT claims.
*   **Obligation:** Taxpayer has the burden to prove (1) payment of input VAT to suppliers; (2) zero-rated sales to purchasers; and (3) that the input VAT is attributable to the zero-rated sales.
*   **Obligation**Strictly comply with the periods for administrative and judicial claims for refund.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Refund:** Failure to timely file the judicial claim results in loss of the refund due to lack of jurisdiction by the CTA.
*   **Insufficient Documentation:** Failure to provide proper VAT official receipts to substantiate zero-rated sales of services will lead to denial of the claim.
*   **Potential for Assessment:** Deficient substantiation could potentially lead to assessment of deficiency VAT.

*   **RA No. 1125, as amended by RA No. 9282:** CTA Charter, specifically Section 11 regarding appeal periods.

*   **AT&T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner (747 Phil. 337 (2014)):** Clarifies the distinction between invoices and official receipts, mandating official receipts for substantiating zero-rated sales of services.
*   **Commissioner v. Manila Mining Corporation (505 Phil. 650 (2005)):** While acknowledging a difference between sales invoice and receipt, the case is not definitive on its application and its context.
*   **Kepco Philippines Corporation v. Commissioner (650 Phil. 525 (2010)):** First directly confronted with the adequacy of a sales invoice as proof of the purchase of services.
*   **Team Energy Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue/Republic of the Philippines v. Team Energy Corporation (G.R. Nos. 197663 & 197770, 14 March 2018):** Further reiterates the need for VAT official receipts to substantiate zero-rated sales of services.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the disjunctive term "or" in Sections 113 and 237 of the NIRC. While the sections state that a VAT registered person must issue an invoice *or* receipt, the SC interpreted this to mean that a VAT official receipt is the only appropriate document for a sale of service and a VAT invoice is the only appropriate document for a sale of goods.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Nippon Express failed to file their petition within the mandatory 30-day appeal period, resulting in the CTA lacking jurisdiction to hear the case.
*   Nippon Express relied on sales invoices and other documents instead of VAT official receipts to substantiate its zero-rated sales of services, which the SC deemed insufficient.
