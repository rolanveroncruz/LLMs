**Legal Document Summary: Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation v. Neptune Orient Lines/Overseas Agency Services, Inc. (G.R. No. 145044, June 12, 2008)**

**Core Issue:** Liability of a common carrier (Neptune Orient Lines) for loss of cargo overboard during a voyage and the applicability of a limited liability clause in the Bill of Lading (B/L) under COGSA.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Shipment & Loss:** L.T. Garments shipped goods via Neptune Orient Lines. The container fell overboard during the voyage due to strong winds and heavy seas.
*   **Insurance & Subrogation:** Fukuyama, the consignee, insured the shipment with Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation (PCIC). PCIC paid Fukuyama's claim and was subrogated to Fukuyama's rights.
*   **Bill of Lading:** B/L No. HKG-0396180 contained a limited liability clause of US$500 per package, unless a higher value was declared by the shipper and additional charges paid.
*   **COGSA & Civil Code Applicability:** COGSA applies suppletorily to the Civil Code provisions on common carriers (Art. 1766, Civil Code). Art. 1753 states the law of the destination country of goods shall govern the liability. Art. 1749 allows for stipulations limiting liability if the shipper can declare a greater value. Section 4(5) of COGSA limits liability to $500 per package unless nature and value declared.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   RTC: Held carrier liable for the full insured value, finding a failure to observe extraordinary diligence.
    *   CA (Initial Decision): Affirmed RTC's decision.
    *   CA (Reconsideration): Modified, limiting liability to US$500 per package, citing COGSA's limitation.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Neptune Orient Lines/Overseas Agency:** Initially held liable for the full insured value by the lower courts but ultimately only liable for US$500 per package due to the B/L's limitation clause and COGSA. The Court found no evidence of an intentional act to destroy the goods, negating the "quasi deviation" argument. Obligated to follow the rules pertaining to common carrier liability.
*   **Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation:** As subrogee, PCIC sought to recover the full amount paid to the insured but was limited to US$500 per package. PCIC failed to prove that a higher value was declared in the B/L.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Limited Liability Clause:** The central contentious point. The clause itself is standard and legally permissible under both COGSA and the Civil Code (Art. 1749).
*   **"Quasi Deviation" Argument:** PCIC's attempt to argue intentional destruction to abrogate the limited liability clause. The court rejected this as not supported by facts and raised for the first time on appeal.
*   **Fortuitous Event Defense:** Respondents initially raised the defense of fortuitous event, which was unsuccessful. This defense is tied to the standard of diligence required of common carriers under the Civil Code.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1732 (Common carriers), 1733 & 1734 (extraordinary diligence and exceptions), 1749 & 1750 (limited liability clauses), 1753, and 1766.
*   **COGSA:** Section 4(5) (US$500 per package limitation).
*   **Everett Steamship Corporation v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 122494, October 8, 1998, 297 SCRA 496):** Reinforces the validity of limited liability clauses in bills of lading.
*   **Sea-Land Service, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court:** Supports the validity of liability limitations where the shipper has the option to declare a greater value.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The document appears to be a straightforward application of COGSA and Civil Code provisions related to limited liability. No obvious ambiguities are present.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' Resolution limiting the carrier's liability to US$500 per package based on the B/L's limitation clause and the shipper's failure to declare a higher value. This case reinforces the enforceability of such clauses under Philippine law when COGSA applies suppletorily. The key takeaway is the importance of shippers declaring the true value of goods in the B/L if they seek full coverage against potential losses. PCIC's attempt to sidestep the limitation failed due to lack of factual basis for its "quasi deviation" argument.
