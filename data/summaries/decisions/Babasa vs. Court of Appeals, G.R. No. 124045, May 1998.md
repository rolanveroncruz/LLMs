**Case:** *Spouses Vivencio Babasa and Elena Cantos Babasa vs. Court of Appeals, Tabangao Realty, Inc., and Shell Gas Philippines, Inc.* G.R. No. 124045, May 21, 1998.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision upholding the trial court's judgment in favor of Tabangao Realty, Inc. (TABANGAO) and Shell Gas Philippines, Inc. (SHELL) in a dispute arising from a "Conditional Sale of Registered Lands" agreement between the Spouses Babasa and TABANGAO. The Court held that the contract was, in fact, an *absolute* sale despite being denominated as "conditional" and the spouses breached their obligation to deliver clean titles.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract of Sale:** Despite the "Conditional Sale" label, the Court found the agreement to be an absolute sale, transferring ownership upon execution and delivery of possession to TABANGAO. Stipulations in the agreement clearly indicated a contract of sale, with terms and stipulations that would make a normal person know it to be a contract of sale.
*   **20-Month Period:** The 20-month period for delivering clean titles was not a condition for the *perfection* of the contract, but rather a condition for the *performance* of the obligation. Failure to deliver within this period did not nullify the contract but gave TABANGAO the option to either demand performance or rescind.
*   **Interest on Balance:** TABANGAO was obligated to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price plus interest. The Court of Appeals modified the trial court's decision regarding the period for the imposition of compounded interest.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Babasa:** Obligated to deliver clean transfer certificates of title to TABANGAO and execute necessary deeds. Failure to comply authorizes the Register of Deeds to transfer title to TABANGAO upon proof of full payment. Liable for costs of proceedings and premium paid on SHELL's bond.
*   **TABANGAO:** Obligated to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price, plus interest.
* **Shell Gas Philippines Inc:** Entitled to the benefits of the lease agreement, which is deemed binding on the Babasa spouses

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Determination of "Clean Titles":** The specific requirements for "clean titles" are not exhaustively defined. Disputes could arise regarding whether the titles meet this standard.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The calculation and payment of interest may lead to disputes. The court of appeals modified the trial court's ruling.
*   **Specific Performance Challenges:** The Babasa spouses are clearly resistant. Enforcing specific performance may require further litigation and potential challenges to the Register of Deeds order.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1477, New Civil Code:** Constructive delivery upon execution of the contract.
*   **Art. 1545, New Civil Code:** Option of party when the obligation is subject to a non-performed condition.
*   **Dignos v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 59266, 29 February 1988, 158 SCRA 375, 382:** A deed of sale is absolute in nature although denominated a “conditional sale” absent stipulations.
*   **Romero v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 107207, 23 November 1995, 250 SCRA 223 and Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118347, 24 October 1996, 263 SCRA 569:** Distinction between conditions for perfection vs. performance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The definition of "clean titles." There are a few cases that define "clean title", but there is no guarantee of compliance with these definitions.
* The interest rates are not specified, and the interpretation of the Court of Appeals on these rates are up for debate.
