Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Henry T. Go v. The Fifth Division, Sandiganbayan and the Office of the Special Prosecutor, Office of the Ombudsman* (G.R. No. 172602, April 16, 2009)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration concerning a charge under Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner Henry T. Go, a private individual, was charged with violating Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019, alleging he conspired with Vicente C. Rivera, Jr., then Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC). The charge stemmed from a contract or transaction alleged to be grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government.
*   **Section 3(g) R.A. 3019 Requirements:** The Court reiterates the elements of Section 3(g) R.A. 3019 (1) public officer entered into a contract on behalf of the government; (2) the contract is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to the government.
*   **Conspiracy:** The resolution addresses the issue of whether a private individual can be held liable under Section 3(g) when conspiring with a public officer. Citing *Meneses v. People, Balmadrid v. Sandiganbayan, Domingo v. Sandiganbayan, Singian v. Sandiganbayan*, the Court acknowledges that private individuals *can* be held liable under Section 3(g) R.A. 3019 if there is an allegation of conspiracy, as per *Estrada v. Sandiganbayan*. The allegation of conspiracy is sufficient if the information uses the word "conspire" or words of similar effect.
*   **Rivera's Acquittal:** A critical turning point is the Sandiganbayan's acquittal of Vicente C. Rivera, Jr. (the public officer) on a demurrer to evidence. The Office of the Special Prosecutor's petition for certiorari of Rivera's acquittal (G.R. No. 185045) was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Initially, Henry T. Go was obligated to defend himself against the charges under Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 due to the allegation of conspiracy. However, this liability hinges on the culpability of the public officer (Rivera).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Dependent Liability:** The key risk lies in the fact that Go's liability is predicated on the public officer's guilt. The acquittal of Rivera removes the basis for the conspiracy charge against Go, but the reversal of Rivera's acquittal could reinstate the charges against Go.
*   **Sufficiency of Allegation:** Although the allegation of conspiracy was initially deemed sufficient, a more rigorous challenge to the factual basis of the conspiracy might have been possible before Rivera's acquittal.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court **DENIES** the Office of the Special Prosecutor's Motion for Reconsideration, subject to the qualification in the body of the decision. The Sandiganbayan is **DIRECTED** to **DISMISS** Criminal Case No. 28092 against Henry T. Go. The acquittal of the public officer (Rivera) effectively removes the basis for the conspiracy charge against the private individual (Go).

**Key Takeaway:** The dismissal hinges on the derivative nature of the private individual's liability when charged with conspiracy under Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019. The acquittal of the public officer removes the foundation for the conspiracy charge.
