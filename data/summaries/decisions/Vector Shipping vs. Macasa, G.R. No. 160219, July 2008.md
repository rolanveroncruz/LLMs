**Case Summary: *Vector Shipping Corporation v. Macasa, et al.*, G.R. No. 160219, July 21, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed with modification the RTC decision finding Vector Shipping and Francisco Soriano liable to reimburse Sulpicio Lines for damages awarded to the Macasa family (victims of the MV Doña Paz tragedy).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Liability:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision holding Vector Shipping and Francisco Soriano liable for the collision between the MT Vector and the MV Doña Paz. Caltex (charterer of MT Vector) was exonerated.
*   **Basis of Liability:** The primary basis of liability is the negligence of MT Vector's officers and crew, compounded by the MT Vector operating with expired licenses/permits and being unseaworthy. Vector Shipping was deemed a common carrier under Article 1732 of the Civil Code, warranting the seaworthiness of its vessel.
*   **Breach of Contract of Carriage:** Sulpicio Lines, as a common carrier, breached its contract of carriage with the Macasa family when the MV Doña Paz collided with the MT Vector. Sulpicio Lines has a right to reimbursement and indemnification from Vector Shipping and Soriano.
*   **Factual Dispute:** Petitioners raised factual issues regarding the negligence of the MV Doña Paz. The Supreme Court reiterated that it is not a trier of facts and will not re-evaluate evidence already passed upon by the lower courts. The factual findings of the CA are generally binding and conclusive.
*   **Res Judicata:** The Court cited its previous ruling in *Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc.*, 374 Phil. 325 (1999), stating that is res judicata to this case being of similar factual milieu and that the same is the law of the case on the matter.
*  **BMI Findings**: While administrative, are given weight due to technical expertise.

**Obligations:**

*   **Vector Shipping & Soriano:** Obligated to reimburse Sulpicio Lines for all damages, attorney's fees, and costs that Sulpicio Lines is ordered to pay the Macasa family.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Vector Shipping & Soriano:** Jointly and severally liable for all amounts.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Limited Appeal Scope:** The Petition for Review on Certiorari limits the appeal to questions of law, preventing the Court from reconsidering factual findings regarding negligence.
*   **Precedent:** The case reinforces the principle of common carrier responsibility and the liability of negligent third parties.
*   **Res Judicata:** Earlier court rulings on the same facts is law of the case.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1732, Civil Code:** Definition of common carriers.
*   **Article 1755, Civil Code:** Extraordinary diligence required of common carriers.

**Case Law:**

*   *Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc.*, 374 Phil. 325 (1999): Established Vector Shipping's status as a common carrier and its liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Macasas disputed the CA’s deletion of the RTC’s award of actual damages and the reduction of civil indemnity, arguing their entitlement based on evidence of income and personal belongings. The court did not rule directly on the amount of damages to be paid to the Macasas.
*   Vector attempted to assert that the decision of the Board Marine Inquiry (BMI) was not yet final. This was dismissed, the Court noting that waiting for a final decision from the DND would limit the courts' jurisdiction to expeditiously try, hear and decide cases filed before them and be contrary to the aim of speedy justice.
