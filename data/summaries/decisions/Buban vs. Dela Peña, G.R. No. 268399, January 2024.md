## Legal Document Summary: Buban v. Dela Peña

**Case:** *Francheska Aleen Balaba Buban v. Nilo Dela Peña*, G.R. No. 268399, January 24, 2024 (Supreme Court).

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Review under Rule 45, involving a labor dispute concerning sexual harassment and constructive dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Sexual Harassment:** The Court affirmed the finding of sexual harassment by Dela Peña against Buban within the meaning of RA 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995). The incidents involved unwanted advances, groping, and creating a hostile work environment. See *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Yañez* on definition of harassment.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Buban was found to have been constructively dismissed due to the hostile work environment created by Dela Peña's actions and Xerox Business's failure to adequately address the situation (inaction after complaint). Cites *LBC Express-Vis, Inc. v. Palco* for the principle that failure to act on a harassment complaint with promptness and sensitivity leads to constructive dismissal.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Xerox Business was held solidarily liable with Dela Peña for damages due to its failure to create a Committee on Decorum and Investigation and to promptly address the sexual harassment complaint as required by Section 4 of RA 7877.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Moral Damages:** PHP 100,000
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** PHP 50,000
    *   **Unpaid Salary:** PHP 2,630.58
    *   These amounts are consistent with the original prayer for relief. The award of damages under RA 7877 is distinct from criminal, civil, and administrative liabilities arising from sexual harassment. Cites *Escandor v. People* on the three-fold liability.
*   **No Separation Pay/Backwages:** The Court denied separation pay and backwages because Buban did not resign and did not suffer a demotion or diminution of pay beyond the unpaid salary. Backwages are tied to economic loss (*Advan Motor, Inc. v. Veneracion*). The case highlights the circumstances that must exist for an employee to be entitled to the twin benefits of separation pay and full backwages.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Xerox Business:** Obligation to prevent sexual harassment (Section 4, RA 7877); solidary liability for damages.
*   **Nilo Dela Peña:** Liability for sexual harassment; solidary liability for damages.
*   Both must pay damages, and the unpaid salary, subject to 6% legal interest from finality of the decision until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Amount of Damages:** The key contention was the CA's reduction of the NLRC's award. The Court upheld the CA, limiting recovery to the amount prayed for. This highlights the importance of clearly defining the desired compensation in the initial complaint.
*   **Technicalities:** The petitioner argued that Dela Peña should have been barred from the proceedings due to lack of participation at earlier stages and pro se filing. The Court rejected this argument, emphasizing the liberal application of rules in labor cases (Art. 227 of the Labor Code). The ruling serves as a reminder for the procedural leniency afforded to litigants in labor disputes, particularly in view of the primacy of substantive justice over procedural technicalities.
* **Independent Action for Damages:** The court cites Sec. 6. Independent Action for Damages of the RA 7877 allowing Buban to still file a separate civil action.

**Overall:** The decision clarifies the solidary liability of employers for sexual harassment committed by their employees, especially when they fail to implement adequate preventative measures and address complaints promptly. It also clarifies the requirements for claiming separation pay and backwages in constructive dismissal cases. The Supreme Court emphasized that employers should not be complacent in addressing instances of sexual harassment within the workplace. While employers may not be able to fully eliminate the potential harm that may befall an employee who is a victim of sexual harassment, the law grants them a positive duty to address such incidents and not be oblivious to the potential violation of the law.
