## Legal Document Summary: Quijada v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126444

**Case Summary:** This case involves a dispute over land originally donated to a municipality for a high school, then later sold by the donor (Trinidad Quijada) to private respondents (Mondejar, et al.) before the condition of the donation failed. The petitioners, heirs of Trinidad Quijada, sued to quiet title, claiming their mother had no right to sell the land because ownership had already passed to the municipality. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling, finding the sale to Mondejar valid.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conditional Donation:** Trinidad Quijada donated land to the Municipality of Talacogon with the condition that it be used solely for a provincial high school. The deed included an automatic reversion clause upon discontinuation or closure of the school.
*   **Sale by Donor:** Before the high school materialized, Trinidad Quijada sold the land to Regalado Mondejar.
*   **Resolution of Donation:** The Sangguniang Bayan of Talacogon later enacted a resolution reverting the land back to the donors as the high school did not materialize.

**Liabilities & Rights:**

*   **Petitioners (Heirs):** Initially sought recovery of the land based on the claim that the sale by their mother was void. They became owners upon reversion of the land. They have liability to transfer the land to the buyer (Mondejar).
*   **Respondents (Mondejar et al.):** Claimed valid ownership based on the sale by Trinidad Quijada and are liable to receive the land from the seller, Trinidad Quijada or her heirs.
*   **Municipality of Talacogon:** No longer a party, but their initial ownership stemmed from the donation agreement. Failure to fulfill the condition resulted in the reversion.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Title Complications:** Although the SC validated the sale, further title issues could arise if the deeds executed by Mondejar to other defendants contain defects or inconsistencies.
*   **Future Litigation:** While the SC ruled on the validity of the sale, disputes over possession, improvements, or other related matters could lead to additional legal challenges.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 712, New Civil Code (NCC):** Modes of acquiring and transmitting ownership, including donation.
*   **Article 734, NCC:** Perfection of donation upon knowledge of acceptance.
*   **Article 1434, NCC:** Seller's after-acquired title passes to the buyer. Relevant case law interpreting this provision includes: *Estoque v. Pajimula, 133 Phil. 55; 24 SCRA 59 (1968); Bucton v. Gabar, 55 SCRA 499.*
*   **Article 1475, NCC:** Perfection of a contract of sale through meeting of the minds.
*   **Article 1459, NCC:** Seller must have a right to transfer ownership at the time of delivery.
*   **Article 1409(4), NCC:** Contracts with objects outside the commerce of men are void (SC held this inapplicable as conditional ownership is within commerce).
*   **Laches Doctrine:** The Court found laches inapplicable as the petitioners acted promptly after the reversion of the land.
*   *City of Angeles v. CA, 261 SCRA 90.* Condition in donation valid.
*   *Central Philippine University v. CA, 246 SCRA 511.* The condition imposed is not a condition precedent or a suspensive condition but a resolutory one.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Ownership Transfer:** The ambiguity lies in when exactly ownership transfers in cases of conditional donations with automatic reversion clauses. The SC held that the donor effectively sold an "inchoate interest" before the condition failed, but the after-acquired title doctrine validated the sale once the condition was resolved.
*   **Nature of the "Interest" Sold:** Whether Trinidad Quijada intended to sell the land itself or her potential interest in it. The Court applied Art. 1434 NCC to validate the sale, indicating it considered the interest to be something less than full ownership at the time of the sale.

**Legally Precise Summary:**

The SC upheld the validity of the sale of land by Trinidad Quijada to Regalado Mondejar, despite Quijada not possessing full ownership at the time of the sale due to a conditional donation to the Municipality of Talacogon. The donation included a resolutory condition that the land be used for a high school, with an automatic reversion clause. The court applied Article 1434 of the NCC (seller's after-acquired title) holding that ownership passed to Mondejar upon reversion of the land to Quijada's heirs. The court ruled against the petitioners' claim of laches. While the sale was perfected upon consent, ownership transferred upon the heirsâ€™ subsequent acquisition of title.
