## Legal Document Summary: Reontoy v. Ibadlit, A.C. CBD No. 190

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a lawyer (Atty. Liberato R. Ibadlit) initiated by his client (Corazon T. Reontoy) for negligence in handling a case for partition, accounting, and reconveyance.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Representation:** Atty. Ibadlit represented Reontoy in Civil Case No. 2805, which resulted in an adverse decision against her.
*   **Negligence:** Atty. Ibadlit received the adverse decision on June 19, 1989, but filed the Notice of Appeal on July 17, 1989, which was beyond the 15-day reglementary period (expiry date July 4, 1989).
*   **Justification:** Atty. Ibadlit claimed he believed an appeal was futile and instructed Reontoy's brother, Proculo Tomazar, to inform her. He alleges he filed the late appeal only after being informed of client instructions, in the interest of justice.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:** Proculo Tomazar denied communicating with Ibadlit on Reontoy's behalf or having any knowledge of the case, contradicting Ibadlit's claims. Reontoy also denies having authorized Proculo to be her representative.
*   **Outcome of Late Appeal:** The trial court denied the appeal and granted a Motion for Execution of Judgment.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** The Supreme Court found Atty. Ibadlit administratively liable for negligence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty of Diligence:** Atty. Ibadlit breached his duty to diligently handle Reontoy's case by failing to file a timely appeal. This violates Rule 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Unauthorized Waiver of Client Rights:** A lawyer does not have the authority to waive a client's right to appeal without express instructions.
*   **Financial Loss:** The client, Corazon T. Reontoy, suffered a loss of her real property due to the lawyer's negligence.
*   **Sanction:** Atty. Ibadlit is suspended from the practice of law for one (1) year.
