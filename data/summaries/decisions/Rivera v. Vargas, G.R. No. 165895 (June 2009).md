## Legal Document Summary: Rivera v. Vargas, G.R. No. 165895

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to set aside the CA Decision regarding an improperly served writ of replevin.

**Facts:**

*   Vargas (Respondent) filed a complaint for recovery of a rock crushing plant against Rivera (Petitioner), claiming ownership and alleging wrongful detention.
*   Vargas obtained a writ of replevin to seize the plant.
*   The writ of replevin was served on the *security guard* at the plant, not on Rivera personally, which contradicts the sheriff's return.
*   Rivera filed an answer and a motion for acceptance of a redelivery bond, which was denied by the RTC as filed beyond the 5-day period.
*   Rivera's argument is that the 5-day period for filing a redelivery bond did not begin to run due to *improper service* of the writ, violating Rule 60, Section 4.
*   Rivera claims the rock-crushing plant was ceded to her husband as part of a dissolution of partnership between her husband and respondent's wife.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 60, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Requires the sheriff to serve a copy of the order, application, affidavit, and bond *on the adverse party* (Rivera) before taking the property. This service is **mandatory** for due process and protection against unreasonable seizures.
*   **Rule 60, Sections 5 & 6, Rules of Court:** Sets a 5-day deadline for the adverse party to file a redelivery bond after the taking of the property.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondent (Vargas):** Faces potential liability for the unlawful seizure of the rock crushing plant if he cannot prove his ownership or if he does not adhere to procedural requirments under rule 60.
*   **Petitioner (Rivera):** Faces a risk of losing the property if it is proven that it belongs to the respondent and not her husband.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 60, Rules of Court (Replevin):** Primary statutory basis for the action and the procedures for seizure and recovery of property.
*   **Article III, Sections 1 & 2, Philippine Constitution:** Guarantee due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   **Art. 527, New Civil Code:** Presumption of Good Faith in the possessor, rests burden of proof on the party alleging bad faith.
*   **Art. 539, New Civil Code:** Possessor has the right to be respected in his possession and be protected by the laws and the Rules of Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Validity of Service:** The central issue is whether service on a security guard constitutes proper service on the adverse party (Rivera) as required by Rule 60, Section 4. The Court found this improper service and noted that Rivera did not waive the right to question the improper service.
*   **Ownership of the Equipment:** Ownership is disputed; Rivera claims it was ceded to her husband upon dissolution of a partnership.
*   **Timeliness of Redelivery Bond:** The RTC's denial of the redelivery bond application based on the 5-day rule is contested, given the improper service of the writ of replevin.

**Summary of Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, **SET ASIDE** the CA decision, and ordered the RTC to:

1.  Restore the parties to their former positions (return the seized property to Rivera).
2.  Discharge Vargas's replevin bond.
3.  Proceed with the trial of the main action (ownership of the equipment) with dispatch.

**Potential Next Steps:**

* Respondent (Vargas) may file a new application for replevin with proper service
*   The trial court will proceed to determine the true owner of the equipment.
