## Legal Document Summary: *Maria Concepcion N. Singson v. Benjamin L. Singson*, G.R. No. 210766 (2018)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging CA decision that reversed RTC's declaration of nullity of marriage based on Article 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:**  Ground for declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations at the time of the celebration of the marriage.
*   **Essential Marital Obligations (Article 68, Family Code):**  Mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect and fidelity and render help and support.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner (Maria Concepcion Singson) sought declaration of nullity of marriage to Respondent (Benjamin L. Singson) citing his alleged psychological incapacity based on pathological gambling and personality disorder.
*   Petitioner presented evidence including her testimony, her son's testimony, and the testimony and clinical summary of Dr. Benita Sta. Ana-Ponio, a psychiatrist. Dr. Sta. Ana-Ponio diagnosed Respondent with pathological gambling and personality disorder.
*   Respondent denied the allegations and claimed the purported incapacity was not grave, juricially antecedent, or incurable. Respondent waived his right to present evidence.
*   RTC granted the petition, finding psychological incapacity based on expert testimony that Respondent suffered from Pathological Gambling Personality Disorder which was grave, permanent, and had juridical antecedence.
*   CA reversed, finding the evidence insufficient to establish grave, serious, incurable psychological incapacity existing at the time of marriage.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals. Petition Denied.
*   The Court held that the Petitioner failed to prove that the Respondent was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential marital obligations because it failed to establish that such incapacity was grave and serious, and that it existed at the time of the marriage, and that it is incurable.

**Key Arguments & Analysis:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Respondent failed to perform marital duties due to psychological incapacity that was grave, incurable, and predated the marriage.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** Petitioner failed to convincingly prove psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations.
*   **Court's Rationale:**  Petitioner's evidence, particularly the clinical summary and expert testimony, did not sufficiently demonstrate a grave, serious, and incurable incapacity that existed at the time of the marriage.  The Court emphasized that evidence showed that the respondent held a job, provided money for the family, provided the land where the family home was built, and lived in the family home with petitioner-appellee and their children. The court also said that respondent's alleged pathological gambling arose after the marriage. Mere difficulty, refusal, or neglect in the performance of marital obligations is distinct from psychological incapacity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:**  The central statutory basis for the claim.
*   **Article 68, Family Code** outlines essential marital obligations.
*   ***Santos v. CA***: Established initial criteria (gravity, juridical antecedence, incurability) for psychological incapacity.
*   ***Republic v. CA*** (Molina Guidelines):  Laid down more definitive guidelines in the interpretation and application of Article 36 of the Family Code. These guidelines incorporate the basic requirements that the Court established in *Santos*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Psychological Incapacity":** The Court strictly construes Article 36, requiring a high burden of proof to avoid dissolution of marriage at the whim of the parties.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The Court is not bound by expert testimony and will independently assess whether the evidence establishes the requirements of Article 36. The clinical summary and expert testimony may be insufficient if not directly correlated to proving the incapacitated spouse's inability to understand and comply with marital obligations at the time of the marriage.
*   **Juridical Antecedence:** Proving that the psychological condition existed at the time of the marriage, even if the manifestations only appear later, is a critical but often difficult element to establish. Vague claims of a dysfunctional childhood will not suffice without concrete evidence.

**Legal Precision & Conclusion:**

This case highlights the stringent requirements for proving psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.  The Petitioner failed to demonstrate that the Respondent's alleged pathological gambling and personality disorder constituted a grave, serious, and incurable incapacity existing at the time of the marriage that rendered him unable to understand and comply with the essential marital obligations. The burden of proof rests with the petitioner to overcome the presumption of validity afforded to the marital union.
