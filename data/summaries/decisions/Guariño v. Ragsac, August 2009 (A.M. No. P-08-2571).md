**Legal Document Summary: *Guariño v. Ragsac***

**Case:** A.M. No. P-08-2571, August 27, 2009 (formerly OCA IPI No. 07-2651-P)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Simeon Guariño, et al. (Judgment Debtors in Ejectment Case)
*   **Respondents:** Cesar F. Ragsac, Sheriff IV; Teotimo D. Cruz, Branch Clerk of Court, RTC Br. 75, San Mateo, Rizal.

**Subject Matter:** Administrative Complaint against Sheriff and Branch Clerk of Court for Grave Abuse of Authority in the implementation of a Writ of Execution in an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Respondent Sheriff Ragsac:** Duty to execute a valid Writ of Execution "pursuant to the Rules of Court" (Rule 39, Sec. 14, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure).
*   **Obligation Under Rule 39, Sec. 10(d):**  If property subject to execution contains improvements, sheriff *cannot* demolish or remove them *without* a special court order issued *after motion and due hearing* where the judgment obligor has failed to remove improvements within a reasonable time fixed by the court.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Sheriff Ragsac:** Found **GUILTY** of Grave Abuse of Authority (oppression). He demolished petitioners' houses without a required special court order for demolition. His defense of "merely implementing the writ" was rejected.
*   **Branch Clerk Cruz:**  Complaint **DISMISSED** for lack of merit.  He issued the writ pursuant to a valid court order. No evidence of wrongdoing presented against him.
*   **Penalty:** Sheriff Ragsac is **SUSPENDED** for six months and one day, with a stern warning.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 10(d), Rules of Court:** Critical provision defining procedure for removing improvements on property subject to execution. The sheriff's non-compliance with this Rule is the basis for the finding of grave abuse of authority.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52 (A) (14):** Cites this provision which defines "oppression" and its penalty of suspension.
*   **Torres v. Sicat, Jr., 438 Phil. 109, 116-117 (2002):** Cited to support the interpretation and application of Rule 39, Section 10(d). Reinforces the need for a special order for demolition.
*   **Hao v. Andres, A.M. No. P-07-2384, June 18, 2008, 555 SCRA 8, 25.** Citation for the appropriate penalty for grave abuse of authority.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Writ of Execution:** The original Writ of Execution *did not* explicitly order demolition. This ambiguity was exploited by the Sheriff, but ultimately the court held that the absence of an explicit demolition order obligated the sheriff to follow Rule 39, Section 10(d).
*   **Lack of Due Process:** The key legal risk is the deprivation of due process suffered by the petitioners. The lack of a hearing prior to the demolition constituted a violation of their rights.

**Legal Significance:** This case clarifies the obligations of sheriffs in implementing Writs of Execution, particularly concerning the removal of improvements on property. It reinforces the importance of due process and adherence to the Rules of Court.
