## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cabacaba, G.R. No. 171310

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II, Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Sale of dangerous drugs (shabu).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Sanny Cabacaba was found guilty of selling 0.04 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a poseur buyer (PO2 Ocampo) during a buy-bust operation.
*   **Sentence:** Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00, affirmed by both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation Validity:** The Court upheld the buy-bust operation as a valid form of entrapment. The arrest was deemed a lawful warrantless arrest under Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court, as the crime was committed in the presence of the arresting officers. *People v. Juatan, G.R. No. 104378, August 20, 1996* is cited in support of the buy-bust validity. *Teodosio v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 124346, June 8, 2004* is cited in support of valid warrantless arrest.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The prosecution successfully presented the *corpus delicti*: (1) Proof of the illegal sale and (2) Presentation of the illegal substance seized from the appellant. *People v. Uy, G.R. No. 128046, March 7, 2000* defines *corpus delicti.*
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Supreme Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, noting the trial court's opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses, in accordance with *People v. Sy, G.R. No. 147348, September 24, 2002.*
*   **Defense of Frame-up/Extortion:** The Court rejected the appellant's defense of frame-up and extortion, citing the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement officers, absent clear and convincing evidence of improper motive.
*   **Elements of the crime proved:** The court highlights that the prosecution proved that the transaction/sale took place, coupled with presentation of the corpus delicti *People v. Boco, G.R. No. 129676, June 23, 1999* and *People v. Montano, G.R. No. 130836, August 11, 2000*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** While the decision mentions the presentation of the shabu, it lacks specific details on the chain of custody from seizure to presentation in court. The Supreme Court's decision does not thoroughly delve into whether the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.
*   **Reliability of Informant:** The reliability and background of the informant who initiated the buy-bust operation are not discussed in detail.  While the Court accepts the buy-bust, a challenge to the informant's credibility could be a potential area of attack.
*   **Validity of Search:** The search of the other individuals present was incident to a lawful arrest, however the details of the arrest and search are not clear. A lack of clarity regarding the circumstances of the arrest and subsequent search could raise questions about the legality of the search.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sanny Cabacaba:** Obligated to serve the life imprisonment sentence and pay the fine of P500,000.00
*   **Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA):** Obligated to properly dispose of the seized drugs according to law, through the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB).
