## Legal Document Summary: Allied Banking Corporation v. Ruperto Jose H. Mateo, G.R. No. 167420 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding legal redemption of a foreclosed property.

**Key Facts:**

*   Respondent obtained a loan (P950,000) from Petitioner (Allied Bank), secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   Respondent defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure. Petitioner was the highest bidder (P1,531,474.53).
*   Respondent attempted redemption via faxed letters, offering P1.1 million.
*   Respondent filed suit for legal redemption, claiming the right to redeem, within the one-year period.
*   The trial court (RTC) initially ruled in favor of Respondent, allowing redemption upon payment of the foreclosure amount (P1,531,474.53) plus 1% interest for one month and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Sec. 6 (Extra-Judicial Foreclosure Law):** Grants debtor one year from the date of sale to redeem.
*   **General Banking Act (RA 337), Sec. 78 (Now RA 8791, Sec. 47):** Governs the redemption price when the mortgagee is a bank. Requires payment of the amount due under the mortgage deed with interest, costs, and expenses.
*   **Rule 39, Sec. 28 of the Rules of Court:** Specifies the amounts payable on successive redemptions.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent:** Obligation to pay the full redemption price to validly exercise the right to redeem.
*   **Petitioner:** Obligation to allow redemption if the proper redemption price is tendered within the statutory period.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Tender:** The central issue is whether the Respondent's initial offer of P1.1 million constituted a valid tender. The Court found it insufficient due to being below the purchase price and not including interest.
*   **Good Faith in Filing Suit:** The Court ruled that the filing of the redemption suit was not in good faith because the offered redemption price was significantly lower than what was owed.
*   **Redemption Price Calculation:** The case clarifies that Section 78 of the General Banking Act (or its current equivalent under RA 8791) supersedes Act No. 3135 and Rule 39 when a bank is the mortgagee, requiring calculation based on the mortgage deed, interest, and expenses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Union Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals:** Section 78 of the General Banking Act governs redemption price when mortgagee is a bank.
*   **BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc. v. Veloso:** Redemption requires actual and simultaneous tender of payment of the full repurchase price.
*   **Hi Yield Realty, Inc v. Court of Appeals:** Outlines requirements for judicial action to preserve redemption rights when price disagreement exists, stressing good faith and prompt payment.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision, finding that Respondent failed to make a valid tender and that the redemption suit was not filed in good faith. Thus, Respondent's right to redeem was lost.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court focused on the strict requirements for a valid redemption, particularly the need for a *bona fide* tender of the full redemption price, as defined by the General Banking Act and related case law. The Court found that Respondent failed to comply with these requirements. The decision underscores the importance of good faith in legal proceedings. Ambiguous clauses can have material effect on the partyâ€™s obligations or right.
