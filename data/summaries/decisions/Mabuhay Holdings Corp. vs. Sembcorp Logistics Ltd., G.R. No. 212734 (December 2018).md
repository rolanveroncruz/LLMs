## Legal Document Summary: *Mabuhay Holdings Corporation v. Sembcorp Logistics Limited*, G.R. No. 212734 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) refusal to recognize and enforce a foreign arbitral award rendered in Singapore in favor of Sembcorp Logistics Limited (Sembcorp) against Mabuhay Holdings Corporation (Mabuhay).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Shareholders' Agreement (the Agreement):** Governs the relationship between Mabuhay, IDHI, and Sembcorp regarding the planned business expansion of WJSC and WJNA. Contains a guaranteed minimum return provision (US$929,875.50) for Sembcorp, guaranteed jointly by Mabuhay and IDHI, and an arbitration clause (Article XIX) stipulating:
    *   Philippine law as governing law.
    *   International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) rules for arbitration (ICC Rules of Arbitration 1998) excluding intra-corporate controversies.
    *   A single arbitrator with expertise in the matter at issue.
    *   Singapore as the venue.
    *   English as the language of the arbitration.

*   **Guaranteed Return:** Mabuhay and IDHI jointly guaranteed Sembcorp a minimum accounting return of US$929,875.50. Payment was due three months after completion of special audits, which revealed losses for WJSC and WJNA.

*   **Final Award:** Rendered by the Sole Arbitrator, Dr. Anan Chantara-Opakom, ordering Mabuhay to pay Sembcorp:
    *   US$464,937.75 (half of the Guaranteed Return).
    *   12% interest per annum on the principal from the date of the award.
    *   US$28,500 (half of the arbitration costs) plus 12% interest per annum from the date of the award.

**Obligations:**

*   **Mabuhay:** Obligated under the Shareholders' Agreement to jointly guarantee Sembcorp's minimum return. Specifically, Mabuhay was held liable by the Arbitral Tribunal for half of the guaranteed return, plus interest and arbitration costs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Mabuhay is liable for the amounts awarded in the Final Award, subject to enforcement by the RTC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of the Foreign Arbitral Award:** Mabuhay sought to resist enforcement of the Final Award, arguing the following grounds for non-enforcement under Article V of the New York Convention:
    *   **Lack of Arbitrator Expertise:** Mabuhay argued that the arbitrator lacked expertise in Philippine law, violating the arbitration clause.
    *   **Intra-corporate Controversy:** Mabuhay argued that the dispute was an intra-corporate controversy, excluded from the arbitration clause, relying on its claim that Sembcorp became the controlling stockholder of IDHI, thus merging the obligor (IDHI) into the obligee (Sembcorp).
    *   **Public Policy (Interest Rate):** Mabuhay argued that the 12% interest rate was contrary to Philippine law and public policy.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards:** Governs the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. Mabuhayâ€™s key arguments were based on Article V of the New York Convention.
*   **UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration:** Incorporated into Philippine law through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 (RA 9285).
*   **Republic Act No. 9285 (ADR Act):** Philippine law promoting alternative dispute resolution, incorporating the Model Law and the New York Convention. Sec. 45 emphasizes exclusivity of Article V grounds for rejecting foreign arbitral awards.
*   **Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution:** Procedural rules governing arbitration in the Philippines.
*   **ICC Rules of Arbitration (1998):** The procedural rules agreed upon by the parties to govern the arbitration.
*   **Philippine Civil Code, Article 1799:** Mabuhay argued that the payment of the Guaranteed Return to Sembcorp is a violation of Article 1799 of the Civil Code.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Expertise in the Matter at Issue":** The Shareholders' Agreement (Article XIX) stipulated that the appointed arbitrator has "expertise in the matter at issue", but did not specify whether expertise in Philippine law was required. Mabuhay contended that given the governing law provision, expertise in the Philippines law was necessary.
*   **Scope of Arbitration Clause:** Mabuhay argued that the dispute was an intra-corporate controversy expressly excluded from the arbitration clause. However, the Arbitral Tribunal decided this issue in the negative.
*   **"Public Policy":** Mabuhay claims that the 12% interest rate violated Philippine law and the public policy of the Philippines.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied Mabuhay's petition, affirming the CA's decision to recognize and enforce the foreign arbitral award. The Supreme Court held that Mabuhay failed to establish any ground for refusing enforcement under the New York Convention or Philippine law and jurisprudence on arbitration, and that the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted properly, its award was not contrary to public policy, and its interpretation of the Agreement was conclusive. The Court adopted a restrictive and narrow approach in defining "public policy" and ruled that the 12% interest rate imposed under the Final Award is not unreasonably high or unconscionable such that it violates our fundamental notions of justice. The Court recognized the Final Award and remanded the case to the RTC for proper execution.
