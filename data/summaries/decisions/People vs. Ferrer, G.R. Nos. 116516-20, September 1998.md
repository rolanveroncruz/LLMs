## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ferrer, G.R. Nos. 116516-20 (1998)

This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Nemesio Ferrer for four counts of rape and one count of attempted rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, based on the testimony of the 14-year-old victim, Irene Paral.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crimes:** Four counts of Rape (Art. 335, RPC) and one count of Attempted Rape (Art. 335 in relation to Art. 6, RPC).
*   **Elements of Rape:** The court emphasizes that the victim's testimony, if credible, is sufficient to prove the crime. The presence of a weapon (knife) was alleged but not presented as physical evidence; the court held the testimony sufficient nonetheless. Penetration, while usually required, is not an essential element; mere touching of the labia or pudendum suffices.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The trial court's assessment of witness demeanor and credibility is given significant weight. No ill motive was ascribed to the victim. The court found the victim sincere and frank and the accused insincere and evasive.
*   **Force & Intimidation:** The court acknowledged the physical disparity between the 14-year-old victim and the 60-year-old accused. The degree of resistance is relative to circumstances. Intimidation negates the need for physical resistance (cites People v. Lusa).  The hymenal lacerations supported the claim of force.
*   **Defense Arguments Dismissed:**
    *   **Consent:** The defense argument of consent was rejected given the age of the victim and the circumstances.
    *   **Impotence:** The defense that the accused was incapable of erection was dismissed as self-serving.
    *   **Inconsistencies:** Minor inconsistencies in the victim's testimony did not undermine her credibility.
*   **Damages:** The court ordered the accused to pay P50,000 for each count of rape and P100,000 in moral damages, citing prevailing jurisprudence on moral damages in rape cases involving young girls. The accused was further ordered to acknowledge and support the child conceived as a result of the rapes.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua for each count of rape, an indeterminate penalty for attempted rape, and accessory penalties. The "three-fold rule" was applied, limiting the total penalty to 40 years.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Nemesio Ferrer is criminally liable for rape and attempted rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** He is liable for monetary damages: P50,000 for each rape and P100,000 total moral damages. He also has the obligation to support the child.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Age Discrepancy:** The court notes the accused's claim of being 60 years old was unsubstantiated. A lack of concrete proof of age could influence future proceedings (e.g. parole, appeals).
*   **Penetration as Element:**  The case mentions touching of the labia as sufficient. Later jurisprudence may alter this specific element, potentially leading to a review or challenge of this aspect of the decision.
*   **Moral damages:** While P50,000 is not uncommon for damages, some jurisprudence may suggest this figure should be higher, given the multiple rapes and age of the victim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Article 6, Revised Penal Code:** Defines attempted crimes.
*   **People v. Lusa, G.R. No. 122246, March 27, 1998:**  Cited for the principle that the testimony of a rape victim is given full weight and credit.
*   **People v. Penero, G.R. No. 116292, July 31, 1997:** Cited in regards to factual findings and witness credibility.
