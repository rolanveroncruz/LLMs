Okay, here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Bobby Pacnisen y Bumacas*, G.R. No. 234821, November 7, 2018 (842 Phil. 1185)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) â€“ illegal sale of dangerous drugs (marijuana).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Pacnisen was charged with selling two bricks of marijuana (2709.35 grams) to a PDEA agent (Esmin) acting as a poseur-buyer for P6,000.00 during a buy-bust operation in San Juan, La Union.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** PDEA Agents, acting on a confidential informant, conducted a buy-bust. Agent Esmin acted as the poseur buyer and handed Pacnisen marked money in exchange for the marijuana.  Pacnisen was then arrested.
*   **Seizure and Inventory:** Inventory and photographs of the seized marijuana were taken at the scene in the presence of the *Brgy. Captain* and a *media representative*. A *DOJ representative* was **absent**.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Agent Esmin requested a lab examination and delivered the seized items to the forensic chemist, who tested positive for marijuana.
*   **Defense:** Pacnisen claimed he was framed; he was merely helping his ex-partner by picking up a bag for her when he was arrested. He denied selling drugs.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Pacnisen guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution established all the elements of the sale and the defense of denial was weak.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision. The prosecution proved the elements of the crime and substantially complied with the chain of custody requirements.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Pacnisen):** Found guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
*   **PDEA Agents:** Obligated to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding the custody and disposition of seized dangerous drugs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 21 Violation (Chain of Custody):** The absence of the DOJ representative during the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs is a key point of contention.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The Court acknowledges the absence of the DOJ representative but rules the justification acceptable.
*   **Lack of Prior Surveillance:** The accused argued no prior surveillance was conducted. The CA cited *Quinicot v. People* (608 Phil. 259 (2009)), stating prior surveillance is not always necessary, especially with an informant. This is a common point of contention in drug cases.
*   **Defense of Denial:** The Court deems the defense of denial insufficient to overcome the positive identification by the poseur-buyer.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Defines the crime and penalty.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Custody and Disposition of Confiscated/Seized Drugs.  Crucial for establishing the corpus delicti.  Specifies requirements for inventory, photographing, and witnesses (elected public official, DOJ representative, media representative).  Cited extensively due to the procedural lapses.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Highlighted the need for the insulating presence of media and DOJ representatives to prevent planting of evidence.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018:** Discussed justifiable reasons for non-compliance with Section 21 requirements.
*   **People v. Ramos, G.R. No. 233744, February 28, 2018:** Emphasized earnest efforts to secure required witnesses under Section 21.
*   **Quinicot v. People, 608 Phil. 259 (2009).** Prior surveillance is not necessary especially when the police operatives were accompanied by their informant during the entrapment.

**Ambiguities & Analysis:**

*   The decision highlights the tension between strict compliance with Section 21 and the practical realities of buy-bust operations. While the *Mendoza* case underscores the importance of the three witnesses to avoid planting of evidence, the Court ultimately accepts the prosecution's explanation for the absence of the DOJ representative due to the time constraints and urgency of the situation. This indicates a willingness to relax the strict requirements of Section 21 when earnest efforts to comply are evident.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding that despite the lack of a DOJ representative, the prosecution established an unbroken chain of custody and proved the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Court emphasized that the PDEA agents exerted an earnest effort to comply with the required procedures and the absence of the DOJ representative was for reasons out of their control.
