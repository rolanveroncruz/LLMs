**Case Summary: *People v. Miraña*** (G.R. No. 219113, April 25, 2018)

**Nature:** Automatic Review of CA Decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder.  Supreme Court modified to Homicide.

**Key Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant (Miraña) killed the victim (Agnas), a 73-year-old woman, with a bolo.
*   Miraña pleaded guilty during arraignment, triggering a reverse trial focusing on his defense of insanity.
*   Defense presented evidence of Miraña's alleged insanity based on behavior prior to the incident (believing the victim was a witch, odd behavior), and a later diagnosis of schizophrenia.
*   RTC convicted Miraña of Murder, appreciating abuse of superior strength.
*   CA affirmed conviction but reduced moral damages.
*   Supreme Court acquitted Mirana of murder and convicted of Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 249 RPC (Homicide):**  Miraña is now liable under this provision. Sentencing guidelines require indeterminate penalty.
*   **Article 248 RPC (Murder):** Original charge, reversed due to lack of proof of qualifying circumstance.
*   **Article 12 RPC (Exempting Circumstances):** Miraña claimed insanity.  The court held the defense failed to meet the burden of proof to establish complete deprivation of intelligence at the time of the crime.
*   Obligation of the accused to prove insanity with clear and convincing evidence, as per *People v. Tibon* (636 Phil. 521, 530-531 (2010)).
*   Heirs are entitled to compensation for the death of the victim

**Liabilities:**

*   Miraña is liable for Homicide. The sentence is indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum.
*   Miraña is liable to pay P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P73,397.95 as actual damages.
*   The award of damages will earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Insanity Defense:**  The case highlights the difficulty in proving insanity as a defense. The bar is high, requiring proof of complete deprivation of intelligence at the time of the crime.  Evidence of prior or subsequent mental illness is insufficient *per se*.
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** The Supreme Court clarified that the age and gender disparity alone are not sufficient to prove abuse of superior strength.  The prosecution must prove that the accused *purposely* sought to exploit their physical advantage. The case relies on *People v. Villanueva* (G.R. No. 226475, 13 March 2017).
*   **Proof of Intent:** The decision hinges on the lack of clear and convincing evidence for both insanity and the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 12 (Exempting Circumstances), 248 (Murder), 249 (Homicide).
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines: Article 800** Every person is presumed sane.
*   **People v. Tibon, 636 Phil. 521 (2010):** Defines burden of proof for insanity defense.
*   **People v. Madarang, 387 Phil. 846, 859 (2000):** Court held that "In the Philippines, the courts have established a more stringent criterion for insanity to be exempting as it is required that there must be a complete deprivation of intelligence in committing the act, i.e., the accused is deprived of reason; he acted without the least discernment because there is a complete absence of the power to discern, or that there is a total deprivation of the will. Mere abnormality of the mental faculties will not exclude imputability."
*   **People v. Villanueva, G.R. No. 226475, 13 March 2017** Defines abuse of superior strength
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):**  Sets standard damage awards for crimes resulting in death.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "complete deprivation of intelligence" necessary for an insanity defense is a contentious legal issue, as it is fact-dependent and open to interpretation. The court applied a very strict standard.
*   Application of "abuse of superior strength" can be subjective. The court emphasized the need to prove *purposeful* exploitation of that strength, which can be difficult to demonstrate.
