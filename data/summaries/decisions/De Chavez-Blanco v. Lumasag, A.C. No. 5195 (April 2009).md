**Summary of A.C. No. 5195 (Nelia Pasumbal de Chavez-Blanco v. Atty. Jaime B. Lumasag, Jr.)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint for disbarment against Atty. Lumasag for deceit, dishonesty, and gross misconduct related to the sale of real property. The Supreme Court ultimately imposed a 6-month suspension.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Sale of Properties:** Atty. Lumasag was authorized to sell two properties owned by Complainant. He sold both properties on March 11, 1990, for P560,000.
*   **Misrepresentation:** Atty. Lumasag misrepresented to the Complainant that he only sold one lot for P320,000. He failed to disclose the sale of the second lot and withheld the remaining P240,000.
*   **IBP Findings:** The IBP found Atty. Lumasag guilty of dishonesty and recommended a one-year suspension, later reduced by the Supreme Court.
*   **Falsification Charge:** The IBP and the Supreme Court found the charge of falsification of the Special Power of Attorney unsubstantiated due to insufficient evidence regarding the Blanco's absence from the Philippines.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Disclose:** Atty. Lumasag had a fiduciary duty to fully disclose the details of the property sales to the Complainant. His failure to do so constitutes a breach of his professional obligations.
*   **Financial Liability:** Atty. Lumasag is ordered to deliver P240,000 to the Complainant, plus legal interest at 6% per annum from March 1990.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reputation Damage:** The suspension and the public nature of the case can severely damage Atty. Lumasag's reputation.
*   **Further Sanctions:** A repetition of similar conduct could result in a more severe penalty, including disbarment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension of attorneys, including deceit, malpractice, or gross misconduct.
*   **Endaya v. OCA, 457 Phil. 314 (2003); Uytengsu III v. Baduel, A.C. No. 5134, December 14, 2005, 477 SCRA 621, 630:** These cases support the principle that the appropriate penalty for attorney misconduct is based on judicial discretion and the specific facts.
*   **Tam v. Judge Regencia, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1604, 27 June 2006, 493 SCRA 26, 37-38, Nedia. v. Lavi√±a, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1957, 26 September 2005, 471 SCRA 10, 20**: These cases support the principle that the burden of proof in administrative cases falls on the complainant

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **SPA Validity:** While the Court did not find falsification proven, the circumstances surrounding the SPA's execution (potential signing outside the Philippines) could have been more thoroughly investigated.
*   **Amount of Sale:** The discrepancy between the initial allegations of P1,120,000 and the deed reflecting P560,000, and the respondent's differing statements, raises concerns about the complete accuracy of the financial details, though ultimately, the Deed of Absolute Sale prevailed as the basis.

**Overall Assessment:**

Atty. Lumasag was found liable for dishonesty and misrepresentation in handling client funds. While disbarment was not imposed, the suspension and order to remit funds, along with the reputational damage, are significant consequences. The case highlights the importance of transparency and honesty in attorney-client relationships. The court's reduced penalty due to advanced age introduces a subjective element that warrants consideration in future similar cases.
