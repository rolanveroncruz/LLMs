Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Guillermo D. Olan vs. Hon. Court of Appeals, Digna Rosales Enterprises, Inc., and Digna Rosales* (G.R. No. 126848, March 12, 1998)

**Subject Matter:** Breach of Contract, Specific Performance, Commissions, Attorney's Fees.

**Key Provisions of the Contract of Agreement:**

*   **Purpose:** Digna Rosales Enterprises (DRE) to supply uniforms to PLDT; Olan to facilitate recommendations of DRE to PLDT.
*   **Commission:** Olan entitled to 1.75% of the total PLDT contract price.
*   **Payment Terms:** Commission payable in installments upon clearance of PLDT checks, tied to specific milestones (downpayment, fitting, delivery, repairs).
*   **Contingency:** Payment only upon DRE's receipt of payment from PLDT. No demand required for payment to Olan.
*   **Duration:** Valid as long as Digna Rosales is the authorized uniform contractor of PLDT.
*   **Jurisdiction & Attorney's Fees:** Makati courts have jurisdiction. Attorney's fees equal to 20% of the amount in question added to the cost of the suit if deemed proper by the court.

**Obligations:**

*   **Olan:** To "facilitate the necessary recommendations" of DRE to PLDT.
*   **DRE:** To pay Olan 1.75% commission based on the payment schedule outlined in the agreement *only* upon receipt of payment from PLDT.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Olan's Failure to Perform:** The central issue is whether Olan fulfilled his obligation. Both lower courts found he did not facilitate the recommendations.
*   **Breach of Contract by DRE:** Olan alleged DRE received P39 million from PLDT but refused to pay his commission. DRE contests the amount received and claims Olan did not perform.
*   **Enforceability of Attorney's Fees Clause:** While the contract includes a 20% attorney's fee provision, the Supreme Court ultimately *deleted* the award of attorney's fees granted by the lower courts because the factual and legal justification for the award was not sufficiently explained in the decisions.
*   **Interpretation of "Facilitate the Necessary Recommendations":** The ambiguity of this phrase is key. The court looked to factual evidence to determine if Olan fulfilled this obligation.
*   **Existence of a Contract** No questions regarding the validity of the contract.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Cited regarding the award of attorney's fees. The SC emphasized that an award of attorney's fees must have factual and legal justification and cannot be left for speculation or conjecture. It reiterated that the award must be properly explained in the text of the decision itself.

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Facilitate the Necessary Recommendations":** The vagueness of this clause created a factual dispute regarding performance. What actions constitute "facilitating" the recommendations?
*   **Conditions Precedent for Payment:** The commission payment is contingent upon DRE receiving payment from PLDT. This is a standard "pay-when-paid" clause, but enforceability depends on the interpretation of the specific language and jurisdiction.

**Summary of the Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the trial court's dismissal of Olan's complaint for specific performance and damages.  The Court found that both lower courts correctly determined that Olan failed to prove he performed his obligations under the contract. However, the Supreme Court *reversed* the award of attorney's fees to DRE because the lower courts did not provide sufficient justification for the award as required by Article 2208 of the Civil Code. Essentially, the SC deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts regarding Olan's non-performance but corrected the legal error concerning the attorney's fees.
