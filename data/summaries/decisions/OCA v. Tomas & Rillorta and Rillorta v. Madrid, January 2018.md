## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-09-2633 & A.M. No. RTJ-12-2338 (824 Phil. 761)

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases involving financial irregularities in the Regional Trial Court, Santiago City, Isabela. A.M. No. P-09-2633 arose from a financial audit, while A.M. No. RTJ-12-2338 is a complaint by Rillorta against Judge Madrid related to the same audit.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Financial Shortages:** Audit revealed shortages in JDF, GF, and SGF funds under former OICs Rolando Tomas and Angelina Rillorta. Significant shortage of P6,557,959.70 in the Fiduciary Fund, later potentially reducible to P113,286.16 upon submission of supporting documents.
*   **Tampering of Official Receipts & Overwithdrawals:** Judge Madrid found guilty of orchestrating the tampering of official receipts and overwithdrawals from the Fiduciary Fund with Rillorta’s participation.
*   **Sole Signatory Issue:** Judge Madrid maintained exclusive control over the General Fund, Fiduciary Fund, and JDF bank accounts, violating Supreme Court guidelines requiring co-signatories (Executive Judge and Clerk of Court).
*   **Disciplinary Proceedings:** Judge Madrid is also facing disciplinary action as a member of the Bar under A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Fe Albano Madrid:**
    *   Found GUILTY of grave misconduct and serious dishonesty.
    *   Retirement benefits forfeited (except accrued leave benefits), with prejudice to re-employment in government.
    *   Directed to SHOW CAUSE why she should not be DISBARRED for violating Canons 1 & 7 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
    *   Subject to potential criminal proceedings.
*   **Angelina C. Rillorta:**
    *   Found GUILTY of grave misconduct.
    *   Retirement benefits forfeited (except accrued leave benefits), with prejudice to re-employment in government.
    *   DIRECTED to RESTITUTE shortages in the Fiduciary Fund after re-computation.
    *   Subject to potential criminal proceedings.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Restitution Amount:** While the initial shortage was substantial (P6,557,959.70), the Court acknowledged the potential for reduction upon submission and reconciliation of supporting documents. Rillorta bears the burden of proving the lower amount. The exact calculation method for determining the final restitution amount is undefined, creating potential disputes.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances vs. Prior Infractions:** The Investigating Justice considered mitigating circumstances in favor of Rillorta, but the OCA emphasized her prior administrative sanctions, leading to a more severe penalty.
*   **Rillorta's Defense:** Rillorta's defense of following Judge Madrid's instructions was rejected. This highlights the personal liability of subordinates even when acting under perceived authority.
*   **Initiation of criminal proceedings:** The legal office of OCA is directed to initiate appropriate criminal proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC:** Governs disciplinary proceedings against lawyer-judges.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 46A(1), Rule 10:** Grounds for dismissal for grave offenses.
*   **Cases cited:** OCA v. Indar, OCA v. Viesca, Antonio T. Quebral v. Angelina C. Rillorta, OCA v. Pacheco, OCA v. Recio

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact scope of supporting documents required to reduce Rillorta’s restitution liability.

**Key takeaway**: This case underscores the stringent standards of honesty and integrity expected of judicial officers and employees. It demonstrates that subordinates cannot escape liability by simply claiming they were following orders from superiors.
