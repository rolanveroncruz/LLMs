**Case:** People v. Layco, Sr., G.R. No. 182191 (2009)

**Summary:**

This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmation of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Lorenzo Layco, Sr. for nine (9) counts of qualified rape of his two minor daughters, AAA and BBB. The Supreme Court modified the damages awarded.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Lorenzo Layco, Sr. was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of nine counts of qualified rape, four against AAA and five against BBB.
*   **Penalties:** Reclusion Perpetua for Criminal Case Nos. 1249, 1250, 1251, 1252, 1253, 1254, 1255, 1256 and 1257. Death penalty initially imposed by the RTC for Criminal Case Nos. 1254, 1255, 1256 and 1257 was commuted to reclusion perpetua by the CA in accordance with Republic Act No. 9346.
*   **Damages:** The appellant was ordered to pay each victim, AAA and BBB, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, due to the aggravated nature of the crime and to protect the young from sexual abuse.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant, Lorenzo Layco, Sr., has the obligation to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and to pay the specified damages to both victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape under the Revised Penal Code, as amended.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the commission of the crime, including civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The appellant challenged the credibility of the victims' testimonies, arguing inconsistencies and lack of corroboration. The Court relied on the trial court's findings regarding witness credibility.
*   **Statutory Rape Elements:** The Court reiterated the elements of statutory rape: (1) age of complainant, (2) identity of the accused, and (3) sexual intercourse.
*   **Date of Commission:** The appellant argued that BBB's failure to recall the exact dates of the rape raises reasonable doubt. The Court held that absolute exactitude of the date is not essential.
