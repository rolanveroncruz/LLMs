**Case:** *San Miguel Foods, Inc. vs. Spouses Ramon and Ma. Nelia Fabie, and Fresh Link, Inc.* (G.R. No. 234849, April 03, 2024)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in finding San Miguel Foods, Inc. (SMFI) liable for breach of contract and awarding damages to Spouses Fabie and Fresh Link, Inc. (Fresh Link).

**Holding:** Yes. The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision, finding that Fresh Link failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that SMFI unilaterally terminated the Complementary Distributorship Agreement. The Complaint was therefore dismissed.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Complementary Distributorship Agreement:** SMFI appointed Fresh Link as the exclusive distributor of SMFI products in specific territories (Makati, except specified areas, and Guadalupe Wet Market). Contractual terms, including exclusivity and Fresh Link’s payment guarantee, were typically renewed annually.
*   **SMFI Obligations:** Maintaining exclusivity of the distributorship; safeguarding Fresh Link’s exclusive rights.
*   **Fresh Link Obligations:** Guarantee payment for SMFI product purchases, initially with a house and lot collateral, later replaced by postdated checks and a credit line secured by a standby letter of credit.
*   **Termination Clause (Article VII):** SMFI reserved the right to terminate the agreement for any violation or cause with 30 days written notice. (The CA wrongly referred to this clause as Article VI.)

**Liabilities and Damages:**

*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC found SMFI liable for breach of contract and awarded Fresh Link PHP 5,800,000 in actual damages, PHP 500,000 in moral damages, PHP 500,000 in exemplary damages, and PHP 100,000 in attorney's fees.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA affirmed the finding of liability but modified the damages, removing actual damages (due to lack of proof) and awarding PHP 1,000,000 in temperate damages, PHP 500,000 in moral damages, PHP 500,000 in exemplary damages, and PHP 100,000 in attorney's fees. The CA also imposed a 6% per annum interest on all amounts awarded from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Reasoning and Analysis:**

*   **Failure to Prove Unilateral Termination:** Fresh Link alleged that SMFI unilaterally terminated the Agreement by halting deliveries of products on credit on June 4, 1999. The SC held that Fresh Link failed to present sufficient evidence (preponderance of the evidence) to support this claim. The Court emphasized that the testimony of Nelia Fabie alone was insufficient to prove the termination of the agreement by SFMI. Evidence suggested that SMFI merely modified payment terms, requiring cash payment due to the expired letter of credit, rather than terminating the contract.
*   **Expiration of Letter of Credit:** SMFI argued that Fresh Link's letter of credit expired on May 31, 1999, justifying the demand for cash payments. Fresh Link contended that a Credit Line Agreement was renewed, allowing for credit purchases until March 31, 2000.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The Supreme Court noted that the documents presented by SMFI to support its counterclaim for unpaid products, as well as the Credit Line Agreement presented by the Respondents to prove that a letter of credit was renewed, were mere photocopies and inadmissible under the Best Evidence Rule. (Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 3).
*   **Judicial Admission:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the Respondents admitted they failed to renew the letter of credit.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Best Evidence Rule:** The inadmissibility of photocopied documents significantly weakened both parties' cases with respect to claims for actual damages.
*   **Judicial Admissions:** The Fabie's admissions that they failed to renew the letter of credit were fatal to their claims.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code Article 1170: Liability for damages due to fraud, negligence, delay, or contravention of the contract.
*   Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 3 - Best Evidence Rule.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA’s decision, finding that Fresh Link failed to meet its burden of proof by failing to establish that SMFI unilaterally terminated the agreement or that SFMI was made aware of a replacement letter of credit. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the Complaint, concluding that Fresh Link was not entitled to damages.
