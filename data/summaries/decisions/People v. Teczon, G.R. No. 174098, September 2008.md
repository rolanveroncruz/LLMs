**Case Summary: People v. Teczon, G.R. No. 174098 (2008)**

This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Reynaldo Teczon for rape under R.A. 8353, committed against a 14-year-old complainant. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision with modifications.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997):** Teczon was convicted under this law for rape. The law defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation against her will, or without her consent. The prosecution must prove the element of force or intimidation.
*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code**: Defines rape and its elements. The SC emphasizes that physical injury is not an essential element of rape, relying on past jurisprudence like *People v. San Antonio, Jr.*
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The use of a deadly weapon (knife) and the victim being under 18 years of age aggravated the offense.
*   **Defense of Denial:** The accused raised the defense of denial and claimed that he saw the complainant engaging in sexual activity with another person, and reported it. The SC gave no credence to the defense.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Reclusion Perpetua:** The accused was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Moral Damages:** The SC upheld the award of Php 50,000 in moral damages. Citing *People v. Cayabyab,* moral damages are automatically granted in rape cases.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** The SC *modified* the CA decision to include Php 50,000 as civil indemnity, mandatory upon conviction. This is in the nature of actual or compensatory damages. Citing *Dimaano.*
*   **Exemplary Damages:** The SC awarded Php 25,000 in exemplary damages because the crime was attended by an aggravating circumstance (use of a knife) and as a public example. Citing Art. 2230 of the Civil Code, and *People v. Mantis.*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The primary issue revolved around the credibility of the complainant. Accused-appellant argued inconsistencies in her testimony and lack of physical evidence. The SC gave credence to the complainant's testimony, citing her age and vulnerability.
*   **Defense's Alibi:** The accused claimed his boils made sexual intercourse impossible, but his own physician-witness contradicted this claim.
*   **Lack of Physical Resistance:** The accused argued that there was no physical evidence of resistance on the complainant's part. The SC noted that resistance is not a requirement in rape cases and a relative term, the complainant succumbed due to fear.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

There were no specific ambiguous clauses. The contentious aspect centered on the interpretation of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. The defendant tried to impeach the victim’s testimony. The court considered the victim’s young age as supporting her account.
