## Legal Document Summary: *Ong v. People*, G.R. No. 176546

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Sandiganbayan's decision finding Felicitas P. Ong, former Mayor of Angadanan, Isabela, guilty of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) due to the overpriced and improperly procured purchase of a dump truck.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019: Causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Elements Proven:** The Sandiganbayan found that all elements of the offense were established beyond reasonable doubt:
    *   Ong was a public officer (Mayor) performing administrative functions.
    *   She acted with gross inexcusable negligence by purchasing the dump truck without the required public bidding and Sangguniang Bayan authorization.
    *   This action caused undue injury to the government because the truck was overpriced and unwarranted benefits to the seller of the truck.

*   **Defense Rejected:** Ong's defense, relying on COA Resolutions 95-244 and 95-244-A to justify the negotiated purchase, was rejected. The Court ruled that these resolutions must be read in conjunction with the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160). The procedure under RA 7160, particularly Sections 366 and 369, was not followed. There were not two failed public biddings for which the procedure required.
*   **Price Discrepancy:** Evidence (price quotations and testimonies) demonstrated that the purchased truck was significantly overpriced, supporting the claim of undue injury to the municipality.

**Obligations:**

*   Public officers have a duty to follow proper procurement procedures as mandated by RA 7160 and related COA regulations. This includes conducting public biddings unless specifically exempted.
*   Public officials have a duty to prevent undue injury to the Government.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ong was sentenced to imprisonment (indeterminate term of 6 years and 1 month to 10 years and 1 day) and perpetual disqualification from public office, as prescribed under RA 3019, Sec. 9.
*   She was ordered to return P250,000 to the Municipality of Angadanan.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Gross Inexcusable Negligence":** The application of this standard is fact-specific, and the Court's finding hinged on Ong's failure to follow established procurement procedures. The judgment implies a higher standard of diligence expected from local chief executives.
*   **Reliance on COA Resolutions:** The case highlights the importance of interpreting COA resolutions in the context of existing statutory frameworks (RA 7160) and established jurisprudence.
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court reiterated its general rule to defer to the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, which limits the scope of review unless specific exceptions apply (speculation, misapprehension of facts, etc.).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Sec. 3(e) & Sec. 9:** defines the offense and penalties.
*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991), Title VI (Property and Supply Management), Sec. 356, 366, and 369:** governs procurement procedures for local government units.
