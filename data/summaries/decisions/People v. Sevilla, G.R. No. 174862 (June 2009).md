**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sevilla*, G.R. No. 174862**

**Nature:** Resolution affirming the conviction of Yvonne Sevilla y Caballero for violation of Section 5, Article III of Republic Act (RA) 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Sale of Dangerous Drugs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Sale, dispensation, delivery, transportation, or distribution of 0.02 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").
*   **Evidence:** Principal witness SPO2 Levi Sevilla testified to a buy-bust operation where he, as poseur buyer, purchased the shabu from the appellant for P100.
*   **Defense:** Appellant claimed innocence, alleging she was framed due to her refusal to cooperate in entrapping another drug pusher.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt; sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.  The RTC highlighted the lack of corroboration from the appellant's daughter regarding the alleged forced arrest, questioning the daughter's unusual lack of resistance.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision in toto.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision. Dismissed the appeal and upheld the conviction, life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve her life sentence and pay the P500,000 fine.
*   The Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 103 is ordered to transfer the custody of the 0.02 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency for proper disposition.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for violation of Section 5, Article III of RA 9165.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The court relies on the legality of the buy-bust operation. A potential area for argument (though unsuccessful here) could be whether the police action constituted entrapment (valid) or instigation (invalid).  The facts presented appear to support the entrapment argument, as the Appellant readily agreed to the sale, however a deeper dive into the facts as presented during trial would need to be reviewed.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The document doesn't explicitly detail the chain of custody of the seized drugs. While the forensic chemist confirmed the substance, a break in the chain of custody (if present in the trial record) could have been grounds for appeal.
*   **Reliability of Informant:** The reliability and credibility of the confidential informant, while not explicitly challenged in the provided summary, are often points of contention in drug cases.
* **Credibility of Witnesses**: The RTC pointed out that, despite her assertion that her daughter was present during her arrest, none of her family members corroborated her testimony. The court found the behaviour of the appellant's daughter "unusual, indifferent and unnatural for she did not even exert any form of resistance if she is of the belief that her mother is innocent of the crime being attributed by the police."
* **Lack of improper motive**: The court cited that Testimonies of police officers who conduct buy-bust operations are generally accorded full faith and credit as they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner. This presumption can be overturned only if the accused is able to prove that the officers acted with improper motives.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article III:** Defines the offense of selling, dispensing, delivering, transporting, or distributing dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Evangelista, G.R. No. 175281, 27 September 2008, 534 SCRA 241, 255 and People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 174773, 2 October 2008, 534 SCRA 552, 567:** Established the elements that the prosecution must prove to secure a conviction in drug cases (identity of seller, object, consideration; delivery and payment).
*   **People v. Evangelista, id., p. 250:** Testimonies of police officers who conduct buy-bust operations are generally accorded full faith and credit as they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner.
*   **People v. Corpuz, 442 Phil. 405, 414-415 (2002):** Affirmed the validity of buy-bust operations as a means of arresting drug law violators.

**Overall Assessment:**

The court relied heavily on the testimony of the police officer and the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties. The defense failed to present a compelling alternative narrative or demonstrate improper motives on the part of the officers, which led to the affirmation of the conviction. A review of the original trial records is necessary to fully assess the completeness of the evidence and the strength of the chain of custody.
