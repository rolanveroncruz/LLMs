**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-16-3586**

**Subject:** Disciplinary action against Clerk of Court II Michael S. Calija, MCTC, Dingras-Marcos, Ilocos Norte.

**Key Provision:** The Supreme Court *Per Curiam* decision finds Respondent Calija GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty for habitual failure to submit Monthly Financial Reports as mandated by OCA Circular No. 113-2004.

**Obligations:** Respondent repeatedly violated his duty under OCA Circular No. 113-2004 to submit timely and accurate monthly financial reports for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ) Fund, Fiduciary Fund (FF), Sheriff's Trust Fund (STF), and General Fund. He also disregarded direct orders from the OCA and the Court to explain these failures.

**Liabilities:** The Court DISMISSES Respondent Calija from service, effective immediately, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave benefits), and prejudice to re-employment in government service, including government-owned or controlled corporations. This penalty is consistent with Sec. 50(A) of the 2017 Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service regarding Gross Neglect of Duty. He was also previously fined P10,000 for gross insubordination.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Severity of Penalty:** The primary risk is the harshness of the dismissal penalty. While the Court relies on Sec. 50(A) of the 2017 Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, a defense might have argued for a lesser penalty based on mitigating circumstances or questioning whether his actions constituted gross neglect of duty versus simple neglect.
*   **Due Process Concerns (though seemingly addressed):** The decision emphasizes that the Respondent was given "ample opportunity" to respond. However, arguments could potentially be raised regarding the adequacy of the notice or the reasonableness of the deadlines imposed.
*   **Definition of "Gross Neglect of Duty":** The decision cites *Ombudsman v. De Leon* and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Viesca* to distinguish gross neglect of duty from simple neglect. The application of these precedents to the specific facts could be scrutinized. Was the level of carelessness sufficient to warrant a "gross" designation?

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **OCA Circular No. 113-2004:** Mandates timely submission of Monthly Reports of Collections and Deposits.
*   **2017 Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Sec. 50(A):**  Defines Gross Neglect of Duty and its corresponding penalty of dismissal.
*   **Ombudsman v. De Leon, G.R. No. 154083, February 27, 2013:** Defines "simple neglect of duty."
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Viesca, A.M. No. P-12-3092, April 14, 2015:**  Defines "gross neglect of duty" and cites *Court of Appeals v. Manabat, Jr.*, A.M. No. CA-11-24-P, November 16, 2011, 660 SCRA 159.
*   **Other Cases:** The decision also cites jurisprudence highlighting the responsibilities of Clerks of Court (*In Re: Failure of Atty. Jacinto B. Pe√±aflor, Jr.*, *Office of the Court Administrator v. Fortaleza*, and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Zerrudo*).

**Summary:**

This case involves a Clerk of Court dismissed for repeated failure to submit required financial reports, constituting gross neglect of duty. The decision is based on OCA Circular No. 113-2004 and the 2017 Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. While the Court claims due process was afforded, potential challenges could focus on the severity of the penalty, the precise definition of "gross neglect of duty," and whether the evidence sufficiently supports that finding.
