**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Fatima Tumangong y Diaz*
**G.R. No.:** 227015
**Date:** November 26, 2018
**Court:** Supreme Court (First Division)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court *acquitted* Fatima Tumangong y Diaz of illegal sale of dangerous drugs (specifically, 0.30 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu") under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), reversing the Court of Appeals' decision that had affirmed the RTC's guilty verdict. The acquittal was based on *failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody* and non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 (prior to its 2014 amendment by RA 10640).

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drug. The prosecution needed to show every link, including testimony from PO2 Saez (the investigator) and PO2 Manuel (who received the evidence at the crime lab), describing their receipt and handling of the evidence. This was not done. (*People v. Hementiza* cited re: requirement for each person handling the evidence to testify).
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 Compliance:** The apprehending team failed to comply with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 (prior to amendment) regarding inventory and photography of the seized item in the presence of the accused, an elected public official, a representative of the DOJ, and a member of the media. The Court found the explanation for not procuring these witnesses and evidence insufficient.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty accorded to police officers was negated by the failure to comply with established procedures. (*People v. De Guzman y Danzil* cited).
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution failed to meet the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Menscule amounts:** Strict compliance is necessary when the amount of drugs is minuscule. (*People v. Caiz* cited)

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The prosecution has the burden of proving all elements of the offense, including the identity of the buyer and seller, the object and consideration of the sale, and the delivery of the item sold and its payment. Crucially, the prosecution must prove an unbroken chain of custody.
*   Law enforcement officers are obligated to strictly adhere to the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165. Justifiable reasons for non-compliance must be provided, failing which the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item is compromised.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Inadmissibility of Evidence:** Failure to strictly adhere to the chain of custody requirements and the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 can result in the inadmissibility of evidence and the acquittal of the accused.
*   **Compromised Integrity of Evidence:** The integrity of the evidence can be compromised if there are gaps in the chain of custody or if the procedures for inventory and photography are not followed, potentially leading to wrongful acquittals.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the ambiguity surrounding the term "justifiable grounds for non-compliance" with Section 21, RA 9165. The courts require a clear explanation of the efforts made to comply with the law and the reasons for failure. A simple lack of resources is not sufficient.
