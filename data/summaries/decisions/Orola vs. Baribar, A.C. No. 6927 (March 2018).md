## Legal Document Summary: Orola and Phil. Nippon AOI Industry, Inc. vs. Atty. Archie S. Baribar (A.C. No. 6927)

**Overview:** This is a disciplinary action against Atty. Archie S. Baribar stemming from a complaint filed by Tomas N. Orola and Phil. Nippon AOI Industry, Inc., alleging multiple violations, including filing a baseless labor case, procuring documents with forged signatures, representing a person not his client, and, crucially, notarizing a document without the signatory's personal appearance.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Violation of 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice:** The core issue is the notarization of a Motion for Reconsideration without the personal appearance of Docufredo Claveria, a clear violation of Rule II, Section 1 and Rule IV, Section 2(b) of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.  The Bureau of Immigration records supported the fact that Claveria was abroad at the time of notarization.  Respondent admitted to this violation.
*   **Violation of the Lawyer's Oath and Code of Professional Responsibility:**  The Court held that by failing to ensure Claveria's presence, Atty. Baribar violated his oath to obey the laws and to do no falsehood. This undermines public trust and confidence in the legal profession.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Atty. Baribar breached his duty as a notary public to verify the genuineness of the signatory's signature and to ascertain that the instrument was the signatory's free act and deed through personal appearance (citing *Flores v. Atty. Chua*, 366 Phil. 132 (1999)).
*   He failed to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession, as required by the Code of Professional Responsibility (citing *Agbulos v. Atty. Viray*, 704 Phil. 1 (2013)).

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   The Supreme Court found Atty. Baribar **GUILTY** of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Sanctions:**
    *   Suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year.
    *   Revocation of his incumbent notarial commission (if any).
    *   Prohibition from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the complaint initially included allegations of filing a baseless labor case and procuring forged signatures, these were not substantiated and did not form the basis of the final disciplinary action.
*   The reliance on the assurances of other clients for identity verification during notarization could be perceived as a recurring issue, potentially leading to future violations.
*   Atty. Baribar argued for a lesser penalty based on *Gamido v. New Bilibid Prisons (NBP) Officials*, 312 Phil. 100 (1995), but the Court distinguished it and imposed a more severe sanction.

*   Rule 138, Section 20 (c), (d) and (g) of the Rules of Court
*   2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (Rule II, Section 1; Rule IV, Section 2(b))

**Conclusion:**

This case emphasizes the importance of adhering strictly to the rules on notarial practice, particularly the requirement of personal appearance. The failure to do so can result in serious disciplinary action against attorneys, including suspension from the practice of law. The ruling serves as a warning to lawyers commissioned as notaries public to exercise due diligence and uphold the integrity of the notarial process.
