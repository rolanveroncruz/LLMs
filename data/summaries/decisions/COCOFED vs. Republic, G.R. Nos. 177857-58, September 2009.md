## Legal Document Summary - G.R. Nos. 177857-58: COCOFED vs. Republic

**Subject:** Urgent Motion to Approve Conversion of SMC Common Shares into SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED), et al. (Seeking approval of conversion)
*   **Respondent:** Republic of the Philippines (Initially questioning COCOFED's personality to seek approval, later supporting conversion through PCGG)
*   **Oppositors-Intervenors:** Jovito R. Salonga, et al. (Opposing conversion)
*   **Key Entities:** San Miguel Corporation (SMC), Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF), Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB), Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Conversion:** 753,848,312 SMC Class "A" & "B" common shares (registered under CIIF companies) to be converted into equal number of SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares.
*   **Preferred Share Features:**
    *   Peso-denominated, perpetual, cumulative, non-voting (except as provided by law)
    *   Par value: PhP 5.00/share; Issue Price: PhP 75.00/share
    *   Dividend Rate: 8% per annum (payable quarterly), subject to step-up after 5 years based on PDSTF rate plus 300 bps (or higher of 8% if applicable)
    *   Optional Redemption: SMC has the option (not obligation) to redeem after 3 years at Issue Price + unpaid cumulative dividends.
    *   Liquidation Preference: Preferred shares have preference over common shares in liquidation.
*   **Trust Fund (CITF):** COCOFED proposes a trust fund for the benefit of coconut farmers, with the Republic (through PCA) as trustee.  This trust fund is to be automatically created after COCOFED appointees join the PCA Board.
*   **PCGG Role:**  PCGG is the authorized entity, as the "receiver" of sequestered assets, to seek Court approval for the conversion, not COCOFED. PCGG approval based on UCPB’s, the Department of Finance and the OSG’s favorable evaluation on the financially and economically advantageous nature of the conversion
*   **Custodial Arrangement:** The preferred shares will remain in custodia legis and subject to PCGG management until the ownership issue of the sequestered assets is finally resolved.
*   **Escrow:** Net dividend earnings and/or redemption proceeds shall be deposited in an escrow account with Land Bank of the Philippines or Development Bank of the Philippines.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Selling Costs:** Borne by common shareholders.
*   **Trustee Limitations:**  PCA, as trustee of the CITF, is limited in its authority to sell/dispose of the Preferred Shares unless redeemed by SMC.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **COCOFED's Role:** COCOFED's proposed terms are considered not material due to the sequestered status of the shares.  Its role is primarily as a proponent, not a party with independent rights over the shares.
*   **Loss of Voting Rights:** Conversion results in the loss of voting rights for the PCGG in SMC.  However, the Court argues that PCGG did not exercise real authority and has the power to prosecute the responsible actors for "greasing the coconut farmers of billions of pesos" if they are found to be in bad faith
*   **Optional Redemption:** SMC's option to redeem preferred shares may disadvantage the eventual owner if the market value at the time of redemption is higher than the issue price. However, the resolution argues it will still be higher due to dividends paid out
*   **Dilution Risk:** Diversification and expansion by SMC can create market risk as SMC ventures into new, not always safe industries.
*   **Control Premium:** While converting the shares at the issue price offers premium to shareholders, it does not factor in the market value and intrinsic value of a block of shares sufficient to elect four SMC directors
*   **Finality:** If at the time of conversion, the prevailing market price is higher than the issue price, then the PCGG would be disposing of the assets held in trust at below the actual market value

**Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 1, Series of 1986:** Creation and powers of the PCGG.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 961 (as amended by PD 1468):** Laws dealing with the development of the coconut industry.
*   **Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68):** Sec. 9 (Treasury Shares); Sec. 6 (Classification of Shares), Sec. 81 (Instances of Appraisal Right)
*   **Rules of Court, Rules 57 and 59:** Preliminary Attachment and Receivership (applied analogously to sequestration).

**Case Law References:**

*   **Republic v. COCOFED (G.R. Nos. 147062-64):** Coconut levy funds are prima facie public funds.  Government allowed to vote shares acquired with public funds.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 88336):** Powers and duties of PCGG as conservator of sequestered assets likened to receiver under Rule 59.
*   **Palm Avenue Realty Development Corporation v. PCGG (No. L-76296):** Court will not interfere with PCGG's discretion absent grave abuse of discretion.

**Ambiguities and Contentions:**

*   **Definition of "clear advantage and material benefit":** This standard, crucial for approving the conversion, is interpreted broadly by the Court in light of economic conditions and SMC's business ventures. Intervenors argue that the advantage is illusory.
*   **COCOFED’s Benefit:** the court points out COCOFED does not stand to benefit from the conversion as portions of the dividends cannot be directly allocated to proposed beneficiaries; this is a point of contention as the law would be contrary to Sec. 2 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 961, as amended by PD 1468

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *APPROVES* the conversion, finding that the Republic has demonstrated it will redound to the clear advantage and material benefit of the eventual owner, considering financial and economic realities. The Court relies heavily on the PCGG’s judgment that the conversion will best preserve and conserve the shares' value given market volatility and SMC's recent investments.  The preferred shares remain in custodia legis until the ownership issue is resolved.
