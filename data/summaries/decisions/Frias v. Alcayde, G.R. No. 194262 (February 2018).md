Okay, here's a legal summary of *Frias v. Alcayde*, G.R. No. 194262, February 28, 2018:

**Case Summary: Frias v. Alcayde (G.R. No. 194262)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision denying Frias' (Petitioner) Petition for Certiorari.

**Facts:**

*   Frias (lessor) and Alcayde (lessee) entered a lease agreement for a property in Muntinlupa City.
*   Alcayde allegedly failed to pay rent, leading Frias to file an Unlawful Detainer suit with the MeTC.
*   The MeTC ruled in favor of Frias.
*   Alcayde filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment with the RTC, arguing lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons in the MeTC case and failure to comply with the requirements to file the unlawful detainer suit .
*   The RTC initially dismissed the Petition for Annulment of Judgment for failure to validly serve summons to Frias, then later granted Alcayde's Motion for Reconsideration recalling the dismissal and later requiring Frias to file an Answer.
*   Frias filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA, which was denied.

**Key Legal Issues and Holding:**

1.  **Jurisdiction over the Person in Annulment of Judgment:** The Supreme Court held that a petition for annulment of judgment is an *action in personam*.  Therefore, the court must acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent (Frias). This directly contradicts the CA's ruling that jurisdiction over the *res* (the petition itself) was sufficient.
2.  **Validity of Service of Summons:** The Court found that the substituted service of summons on Frias in the RTC case was *invalid* because the Sheriff's Return failed to demonstrate impossibility of personal service, enumerate efforts to locate Frias, and specify details justifying service to a specific secretary of her counsel.  The Court cites *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals* (530 Phil. 454 (2006)) for the requirements of valid substituted service. The Court emphasized the specific requirements that must be met for substituted service.
3.  **Voluntary Appearance:** The Court held that Frias' "special appearance" to contest jurisdiction did *not* constitute a voluntary submission to the RTC's jurisdiction. Her actions (filing motions to dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction) explicitly demonstrated an intent *not* to submit to the court's authority.  The Court cited *Prudential Bank v. Magdamit, Jr.* (746 Phil. 649 (2014)) regarding conditional appearance.
4.  **Annulment of Judgment as Improper Remedy:** The Court ruled that Alcayde's petition for annulment of judgment was an *improper remedy* because he failed to avail himself of the ordinary remedies of appeal, motion for new trial, or petition for relief from judgment in the original MeTC case. Thus the decision of the MTC has become final and executory and the RTC is precluded from examining the final and executory MTC decision.

**Key Provisions and Concepts:**

*   **Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7 of the Rules of Court:**  Governing personal and substituted service of summons.
*   **Rule 47 of the Rules of Court:**  Governing annulment of judgment.
*   **Action *In Personam* vs. *In Rem* vs. *Quasi In Rem*:** Distinctions and jurisdictional requirements.
*   **Due Process:**  Requires proper notice and opportunity to be heard.
*   **Jurisdiction over the Person:** Acquired through service of summons or voluntary appearance.
*   **Voluntary vs. Special Appearance:**  Distinction based on intent to submit to jurisdiction.
*   **Immutability of Judgments:** Final judgments are immutable and unalterable.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The MeTC judgment against Alcayde is reinstated, obligating him to vacate the property and pay accrued rentals, interests, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the strict requirements for valid substituted service. Failure to meticulously comply with Rule 14 can render judgments void for lack of jurisdiction.
*   The Court clarifies that simply filing a petition for annulment of judgment does not vest jurisdiction, emphasizing the importance of proper service of summons and the distinction between actions *in personam* and those affecting property (*in rem* or *quasi in rem*).
*   The ruling reinforces the principle that annulment of judgment is not a substitute for a lost appeal.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals* (530 Phil. 454 (2006)): Outlines the requirements for valid substituted service.
*   *Prudential Bank v. Magdamit, Jr.* (746 Phil. 649 (2014)): Discusses voluntary vs. special appearance.
*   *Guiguinto Credit Cooperative, Inc. (GUCCI) v. Torres* (533 Phil. 476 (2006)): Function of summons in court actions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, emphasizing that annulment of judgment is an *in personam* action requiring jurisdiction over the respondent, and invalidating the substituted service of summons.  It also underscores that annulment is not a substitute for a lost appeal. This case serves as a reminder of the critical importance of proper service of summons and understanding the nature of the action when determining jurisdictional requirements.

I hope this is helpful!
