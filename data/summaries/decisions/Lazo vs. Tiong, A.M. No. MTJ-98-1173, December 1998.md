## Legal Document Summary: Lazo vs. Judge Tiong (A.M. No. MTJ-98-1173)

**Overview:** This is an administrative matter concerning a complaint filed by Carlitos Lazo against Judge Antonio V. Tiong for grave misconduct and abuse of authority. The core issue revolves around Judge Tiong's failure to timely inhibit himself from a case (Criminal Case No. 4384) where the accused was related to him by affinity (wife's first cousin).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 137, Section 1, Rules of Court (Disqualification of Judges):** Mandates disqualification of judges related to a party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity. This is a *mandatory* provision, removing judicial discretion. This is the core statutory reference.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3, Rule 3.12:**  A judge should not participate in a proceeding where impartiality might be reasonably questioned.
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.02:** Judges must administer justice impartially and without delay.

**Liabilities and Findings:**

*   **Violation of Rule 137, Section 1:** Judge Tiong acted in the case for approximately two months *after* knowledge of the relationship and a motion for inhibition, thus violating the mandatory rule on disqualification.
*   **Failure to Maintain Impartiality:** The Court emphasized the importance of preventing the appearance of impropriety. Judge Tiong's actions created an impression of potential bias.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Judge Tiong's Defense:** Judge Tiong argued that he delayed inhibition to facilitate an amicable settlement between the complainant and the accused, who are brothers. The Court acknowledged the praiseworthy intent but explicitly rejected this as justification for disregarding the law. This underscores the primacy of ethical judicial conduct over perceived beneficial outcomes.
*   **Clerk of Court Error:** Judge Tiong attempted to deflect blame by attributing the scheduling error (setting arraignment on a day the prosecutor was unavailable) to the Clerk of Court. While acknowledging the clerk's administrative role, the Court ultimately held the judge accountable for the overall lapse in judgment regarding the conflict of interest.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the RTC. Branches 61, 134 and 137, Makati, Metro, Manila 248 SCRA 25 (1995):**
*   **Mejia vs. Justice Pamaran, et al., 160 SCRA 457 (1988):**
*   **Re: Inhibition of Judge Eddie R. Rojas, RTC-Br. 39, Polomolok, South Cotabato in Criminal Case No. 09-5668, A.M. No. 98-6-485-RTC, October 30, 1998:**

**Ambiguity and Mitigation:**

*   The Court explicitly stated that there was no evidence of malice or corrupt motive in Judge Tiong's delay. This mitigated the severity of the penalty.

**Outcome:** Judge Tiong was reprimanded with a warning against future similar conduct. This underscores the importance of strict adherence to the rules regarding judicial disqualification, regardless of perceived mitigating circumstances.
