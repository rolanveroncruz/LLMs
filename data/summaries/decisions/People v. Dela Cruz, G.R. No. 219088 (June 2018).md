**Case Summary: *People v. Dela Cruz*, G.R. No. 219088 (June 13, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Ronnie Dela Cruz for rape under Article 266-A(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) concerning a minor, AAA.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Charge:** Rape under Article 266-A(a) RPC in relation to Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). The information specifically alleged force, threat, and intimidation against AAA, a 14-year-old.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** AAA testified that Dela Cruz took her to his house after a drinking session, followed her into an unlit room, and had sexual intercourse with her against her will, despite her telling him to stop and pushing him away. This was corroborated by medical examination showing fresh hymenal lacerations.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Dela Cruz claimed he was drunk and could not recall the events clearly, but asserted that any sexual act was consensual.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC found Dela Cruz guilty based on AAA's credible testimony and corroborating medical evidence. The CA affirmed. Both courts emphasized that the degree of force required for rape is relative and that AAA's resistance, though not "hard enough," was still indicative of non-consent.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Dela Cruz has a legal obligation to refrain from non-consensual sexual acts, especially against minors.
*   His actions constitute the crime of rape, resulting in a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and monetary damages.

**Monetary Damages Awarded (As Modified by Supreme Court):**

*   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00 (increased from P50,000.00 by SC)
*   Moral Damages: P75,000.00 (increased from P50,000.00 by SC)
*   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00 (increased from P30,000.00 by SC)
*   Interest: 6% per annum on all damages from finality of judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Consent:** The primary contention is the issue of consent. Dela Cruz's defense hinges on the claim that any sexual act was consensual. The Supreme Court emphasizes the relativity of the degree of force required, especially considering AAA's age and state of intoxication, citing *People v. Joson* (751 Phil. 450 (2015)).
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Dela Cruz challenged AAA's credibility, arguing her actions were contrary to human experience. The Supreme Court reiterated the deference given to trial courts in assessing witness credibility, citing *People v. Sapigao, Jr.* (G.R. No. 178485, 614 Phil. 589 (2009)), given their opportunity to observe demeanor and conduct firsthand.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act (relevant to confidentiality of the victim's identity).
*   **People v. Joson, 751 Phil. 450 (2015):** Establishes that the force required in rape is relative to the circumstances, including the victim's age and strength.
*   **People v. Sapigao, Jr., G.R. No. 178485, 614 Phil. 589 (2009):** Affirms the trial court's superior position in assessing witness credibility.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Sets the standard for damages to be awarded in rape cases (used by the SC to modify the awarded damages).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Dela Cruz's conviction for rape, emphasizing that force need not be irresistible and that non-consent can be expressed through words and actions. The Court gave significant weight to the trial court's assessment of the victim's credibility. The judgment was modified only to increase the monetary damages in line with the *People v. Jugueta* ruling. The key takeaway is the court's recognition of the relative nature of force in rape cases and the deference shown to trial courts in credibility determinations.
