## Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. Cordero (G.R. No. 171378/171388)

**Case:** *Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) vs. Maria Teresa S.A. Cordero* (consolidated with *Employees' Compensation Commission vs. Maria Teresa S.A. Cordero*)

**Citation:** 600 Phil. 678; 106 OG No. 6, 772 (February 8, 2010) (Decision Date: March 17, 2009)

**Core Issue:** Whether Cordero's End Stage Renal Disease secondary to Chronic Glomerulonephritis is compensable under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 626, as amended.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding Cordero's illness compensable under P.D. No. 626, as amended. The GSIS was ordered to pay compensation benefits.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **P.D. No. 626, as amended:** The governing law for employees' compensation. The Court emphasizes its nature as social legislation, requiring liberal interpretation in favor of the employee.
*   **Section 1(b), Rule III (Implementing Rules of P.D. No. 626):** Sickness is compensable if (1) it's listed as an occupational disease in Annex "A", OR (2) proof shows the risk of contracting the disease was increased by working conditions. This provision sets the stage for the "increased risk" argument.
*   **"Increased Risk" Theory:** Since Chronic Glomerulonephritis is not a listed occupational disease, Cordero had to prove her working conditions increased the risk of contracting it.
*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The Court reiterates that P.D. No. 626 requires only "substantial evidence," not strict proof. This means evidence a reasonable mind would accept as adequate.
*   **Work-Connection vs. Causal Relation:** The Court requires only a "reasonable work-connection" and not a direct causal relation. This relaxed standard benefits the employee.

**Key Arguments & Evidence:**

*   **Cordero's Argument:**  She was healthy upon employment but developed hypertension and subsequently Chronic Glomerulonephritis/End Stage Renal Disease due to her work-related stress and conditions.  She presented a medical certificate from Dr. Pine stating that her conditions were work related and a GSIS certification stating her work outside of the office increased the risk of developing hypertension.
*   **GSIS/ECC Argument:**  Cordero's position as Senior General Insurance Specialist did not expose her to occupational hazards that would result in kidney injury.  No exposure to chemicals implicated in Chronic Glomerulonephritis.
*   **Court's Rationale:**
    *   **Doctor's Certification:** The Court gave weight to Dr. Pine's certification linking hypertension to her employment, citing precedent (*Ijares v. Court of Appeals*) that doctors' certifications are generally credible.
    *   **Clean Bill of Health at Entry:** Cordero's initial health was considered proof that her condition developed *during* employment.
    *   **Connection Between Hypertension and Kidney Disease:** The court acknowledged the scientific link between hypertension (reasonably connected to work) and End Stage Renal Disease, referencing *Republic v. Mariano*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Increased Risk":** The "increased risk" standard, while benefiting employees, can be subjective and lead to inconsistent applications. This decision relies heavily on the doctor's certification and the "reasonable" connection, opening the door for future challenges based on differing medical opinions.
*   **Lack of Specific Hazard Identification:** The Court does not specifically identify which aspects of Cordero's job directly *caused* the hypertension. The ruling suggests that *any* stressful work environment could potentially be linked to hypertension and subsequent kidney disease, creating a broad precedent.
*   **Precedent Setting:** This case reinforces the principle of liberal interpretation of social legislation in favor of employees. Future cases will likely cite this decision when arguing for the compensability of illnesses not explicitly listed as occupational diseases.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Ijares v. Court of Appeals* (on credibility of doctor's certifications)
*   *Republic v. Mariano* (establishing the link between hypertension and kidney disease)
*   *Jacang v. Employees' Compensation Commission, Castor-Garupa v. Employees' Compensation Commission, Salalima v. Employees' Compensation Commission, Limbo v. Employees' Compensation Commission* (used to reiterate the importance of a "reasonable work-connection and not a direct causal relation")
