**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Gerry Sumalpong, et al.* (G.R. No. 124705, January 20, 1998)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reviewed the conviction of Gerry Sumalpong and Melchor Fernando for murder and frustrated murder by the trial court. The Court affirmed their guilt but modified the penalties.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Facts:** Sumalpong and Fernando, along with two others, attacked Arola Dilangalen and Mohammad Managuili. Dilangalen died; Managuili survived and identified Sumalpong as his attacker and Fernando as among Dilangalen's attackers.

*   **Positive Identification:** Managuili's positive and unequivocal identification of Sumalpong and Fernando was deemed credible and sufficient despite the defense of alibi.  The Court emphasized the trial court's advantage in assessing witness credibility, citing *People vs. Cayabyab*.

*   **Treachery (Article 14, No. 16, Revised Penal Code):** Found to be present due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, giving the victims no opportunity to defend themselves. *People vs. Belga* was cited.

*   **Conspiracy:**  The Court agreed with the trial court's finding of conspiracy, based on the concerted actions of the accused indicating a unity of design and objective in attacking the victims (*People vs. Lopez*).

*   **Alibi:**  Rejected as a defense. The Court stated it is the weakest of all defenses, and it was discredited by the positive identification by the victim and the inconsistencies in the witness testimonies *People vs. Namayan*.

*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Appellant Fernandoâ€™s claim of voluntary surrender was rejected because the police was already searching for him when the barangay captain convinced him to surrender with assurances of safety. *People vs. Camahalan.*

*   **Evident Premeditation:** **Erroneously Appreciated.** The Supreme Court reversed the trial court's finding of evident premeditation because the prosecution failed to establish the elements beyond reasonable doubt: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that he clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time, between determination and execution, to allow himself to reflect upon the consequences of his act (*People vs. Baydo*, *People vs. Muyano*).

*   **Frustrated Murder vs. Attempted Murder:** The court reduced the conviction of the surviving victim from Frustrated Murder to Attempted Murder as it was not proven that the stab wound was so serious as to cause death had the victim not seek timely medical assistance. *People vs. Nardo*

*   **Damages:** The trial court awarded exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim, however, the Supreme Court corrected the amount to the correct jurisprudence of 50,000, while exemplary damages may be awarded if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances duly proven (*People vs. Caballes*).

**Penalties Modified:**

*   The death sentence for murder was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* due to the lack of aggravating circumstances.
*   The conviction for frustrated murder was modified to attempted murder.
*   Monetary awards for damages were adjusted to conform with prevailing jurisprudence.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Articles 14, 51, 61, 63, 248.
*   Republic Act (R.A.) 7659: Section 6 (Amendment to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code - Murder).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The Supreme Court properly discredited the hearsay evidence presented by the prosecution.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the convictions for the crimes, but lowered the sentence for the murder and reduced the conviction for the surviving victim to attempted murder, for lack of sufficient evidence to convict on the more severe crime of murder. The Supreme Court also rectified the damage awards to be within the law.
