## Legal Document Summary: *Montanez v. PARAD, et al.* (G.R. No. 183142, Sept. 17, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA Amended Decision which dismissed a petition for certiorari concerning the annulment/cancellation of CLOAs (Certificates of Land Ownership Award) and corresponding titles.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Land Ownership & CARP Coverage:** Rosita Montanez (Petitioner) owned two parcels of land (35.5998 hectares total) placed under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). DAR issued a Notice of Coverage but contained an error in the TCT number.
*   **Valuation & Transfer:** LBP valued the land and issued a certification of deposit to Montanez (rejected by her), DAR cancelled Montanez's TCTs and issued new TCTs in the name of the Republic of the Philippines (RP) with Montanez holding a small share. Subsequently, CLOAs were issued to farmer beneficiaries.
*   **PARAB Petition & Decision:** Montanez filed a petition with the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAB) for annulment/cancellation of the CLOAs and RP titles, alleging irregular and anomalous issuance based on discrepancies in land area. The PARAB dismissed the petition, stating the issues were technical and correctible administratively.
*   **CA Proceedings:** Montanez filed a petition for certiorari directly with the Court of Appeals (CA) under Section 54 of RA 6657. The CA initially ruled in Montanez's favor, ordering DAR to correct the technical errors. However, on reconsideration, the CA reversed itself and dismissed Montanez's petition, holding she failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not appealing the PARAB decision to the DARAB Proper.

**Obligations:**

*   **Montanez:** Obligated to exhaust administrative remedies by appealing the PARAB decision to the DARAB Proper.
*   **DAR & LBP:** Obligation to ensure accurate land valuation, proper issuance of TCTs and CLOAs under CARP guidelines, and payment of just compensation.
*   **CARP Beneficiaries:**  Obligations pertaining to CARP beneficiaries.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Montanez:** Risk of losing her land without just compensation if the CARP acquisition is upheld. Potential liability for costs.
*   **DAR:** Potential liability for errors in the land acquisition process, improper issuance of CLOAs, and failure to provide just compensation. Risks of challenges by other landowners in similar situations.
*   **CARP Beneficiaries:** Risk of losing their CLOAs if the acquisition is deemed invalid, but also benefit from CARP implementation.
*   **Ambiguous/Contentious Issues:** Erroneous TCT number in the Notice of Coverage; discrepancy between land area in the CLOAs and the underlying titles; whether proper segregation of non-agricultural land occurred.
*  **Procedural Non-Compliance:** Failure to follow proper appeal procedure which may have resulted in finality of PARAD's decision.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Governs the land acquisition and distribution process. Section 54 addresses CA jurisdiction via certiorari.
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 2, Series of 1994:** Lists grounds for cancellation of CLOAs and EPs, the non-enumerated nature of which was used against the land owner in the PARAD.
*   **DARAB Rules of Procedure (2003):** Outlines the jurisdictional structure of the DARAB and the rules for appeals, specifically regarding the role of the PARAD and the DARAB Proper.
*   ***Paat v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. No. 111107):** Sets out the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and its exceptions.
*   ***Asia International Auctioneers, Inc. v. Parayno*** **(G.R. No. 163445):**  Reinforces the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and consequences of premature invocation of court intervention.
* ***Nuesa v. Court of Appeals:*** Delineates the boundaries of adjudicative competence between DAR and DARAB.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The CLOAs containing areas bigger and larger than the title from which they emanate creates a question of due process and just compensation.
*   The Court questions the process by which CARP purposes acquired land in light of negligence of agents and tainted CLOAs.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *denied* the Petition, *affirmed* the CA's Amended Decision, and *remanded* the case to the DARAB for proper disposition of the issues.
**Risk Assessment:** The matter has been remanded to DARAB. There is an opportunity to make arguments there for recovery of the land or just compensation.
