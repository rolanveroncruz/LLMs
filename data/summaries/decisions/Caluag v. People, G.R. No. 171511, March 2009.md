**Case:** *Ronnie Caluag v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 171511, March 4, 2009.

**Summary:** This is a review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) affirmation of the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC) Joint Decision finding Petitioner Ronnie Caluag guilty of Slight Physical Injuries (Art. 266, RPC) and Grave Threats (Art. 282, RPC). Jesus Sentillas was also found guilty of Slight Physical Injuries. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Slight Physical Injuries:** Caluag and Sentillas were found guilty of mauling Nestor Denido, inflicting injuries requiring medical attendance for less than nine days.
*   **Grave Threats:** Caluag was found guilty of threatening Julia Denido by pointing a gun at her and uttering, "Saan ka pupunta gusto mo ito?" The MeTC, RTC, and CA all found this to constitute Grave Threats.
*   **Factual Basis:** The convictions were based primarily on the testimonies of the private complainants, Nestor and Julia Denido. The MeTC found their testimonies credible and in accord with the natural course of events. Caluag's defense was primarily denial, which was not persuasive. The SC affirmed the lower courts' findings that the testimonies of the victims were more credible than the defendant's.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Caluag & Sentillas:** Obligation to pay a fine of P200 each for Slight Physical Injuries.
*   **Caluag:** Obligation to serve two (2) months imprisonment and pay a fine of P200 for Grave Threats.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Findings:** The petitioner contested the factual findings of the lower courts, arguing that an independent witness supported his version of events and that the lower courts erred in believing the testimony of the intoxicated victim. However, the SC reaffirmed the principle that factual findings affirmed by the CA are generally binding on the SC.
*   **Grave Threats vs. Other Light Threats (Art. 285, RPC):**  Caluag argued that if he did point a gun, it constituted "other light threats" under Art. 285, not Grave Threats under Art. 282. The SC rejected this argument, emphasizing that because the threat constituted a crime i.e. potential to cause serious injury or death, it was properly categorized as Grave Threats without needing the fulfillment of a condition. The SC explicitly distinguished between Grave Threats (Art. 282), Light Threats (Art. 283), and Other Light Threats (Art. 285), clarifying that Grave Threats involves a wrong amounting to a crime, with or without a condition.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**  Art. 266 (Slight Physical Injuries), Art. 282 (Grave Threats), Art. 283 (Light Threats), Art. 285 (Other Light Threats).
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Pertains to appeals to the Supreme Court on questions of law. The court reiterated that it is not its function to weigh the evidence again.
*   **Lamis v. Ong, G.R. No. 148923, August 11, 2005, 466 SCRA 510:**  Cited regarding the definition of questions of fact vs. questions of law.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention was the proper classification of the threat. While the facts were established, the defense argued for a lower classification of the crime i.e. "Other Light Threats." The Supreme Court's analysis clarifies the distinguishing elements between the different categories of threats under the RPC.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Ronnie Caluag for Slight Physical Injuries and Grave Threats, affirming the factual findings and legal conclusions of the lower courts. The distinction between Grave Threats and Other Light Threats hinges on whether the threatened wrong amounts to a crime.
