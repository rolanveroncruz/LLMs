**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Antonio*, G.R. No. 180920 (2008)**

**Nature:** Supreme Court Resolution affirming the conviction of Edgardo Z. Antonio for qualified rape of a 6-year-old minor (AAA).  The case involves an appeal of the Court of Appeals decision, which affirmed the trial court's conviction but modified the penalty following the enactment of RA 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Qualified rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), specifically qualified by the victim being under 7 years old.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole, pursuant to RA 9346.  The original death penalty imposed by the trial court was modified.
*   **Civil Liabilities:** P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages, and P25,000 exemplary damages. The Supreme Court corrected the Court of Appeals decision regarding civil indemnity, increasing it from P50,000 to P75,000, consistent with *People v. Bejic*.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused, Edgardo Z. Antonio, is obligated to serve the sentence of reclusion perpetua and to pay the civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages as ordered.

**Liabilities:**

*   The primary liability is criminal, stemming from the violation of Article 266-B of the RPC.
*   Secondary liabilities are civil, consisting of the pecuniary damages awarded to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **None apparent.** The case rests on the factual determination of the lower courts, which gave credence to the victim's testimony. The legal principles related to the applicable penalty and civil liabilities are well-established and consistently applied.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 266-B:** Defines rape and establishes penalties.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines, impacting the penalty imposed and requiring the application of reclusion perpetua.
*   ***People v. Mateo*, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 04 July 2004, 433 SCRA 658.:** Procedural authority for remanding cases to the Court of Appeals.
*   ***People v. Bejic*, G.R. No. 174060, 25 June 2007:**  Clarifies the award of civil indemnity in cases where the death penalty would have been imposed but is now prohibited by RA 9346. Establishes P75,000 civil indemnity standard.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial plea of guilty and subsequent withdrawal could have presented issues. However, the trial proceeded *de novo*, and the conviction rested on evidence presented during the trial. The Supreme Court found no reason to overturn the factual findings of the lower courts.
*   The Court of Appeals' initial error in reducing the civil indemnity could be interpreted as a misapplication of RA 9346. However, the Supreme Court rectified this, aligning the award with prevailing jurisprudence.

**Conclusion:** The document reflects a straightforward application of criminal law and procedure. The Supreme Court affirms a conviction based on factual findings and clarifies the proper application of RA 9346 in relation to civil liabilities in heinous crimes.
