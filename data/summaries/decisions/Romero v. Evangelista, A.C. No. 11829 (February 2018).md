### Legal Document Summary: *Maria Romero v. Atty. Geronimo R. Evangelista, Jr.* (A.C. No. 11829)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Evangelista for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and Canons of Professional Ethics, specifically for representing conflicting interests.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Conflict of Interest:** Atty. Evangelista previously represented Maria Romero and Adela Romero (individually and as heirs), then subsequently represented Spouses Valles in lawsuits against Adela Romero in three separate civil cases.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Evangelista argued no attorney-client relationship with Maria, no receipt of privileged information from Maria, no legal fees paid by Maria, and Adela did not authorize the complaint.
*   **IBP Findings:** The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) found Atty. Evangelista guilty of representing conflicting interests and recommended a one-year suspension, based on documented evidence and irrespective of Adela's formal complaint. The IBP reasoned that Adela's participation in the filing of the action is not necessary since Atty. Evangelista's culpability had been established by documentary evidence on record
*   **Written Consent:** There was no written consent obtained from all parties involved after full disclosure, as required by Canon 15, Rule 15.03 of the CPR.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   **Canon 15, Rule 15.03 CPR:** Prohibits representing conflicting interests without written consent after full disclosure.
*   **Canons of Professional Ethics:** Specifically Canon 6, prohibiting representation of conflicting interests absent express consent.
*   **Duty of Fidelity:** Violation of the lawyer's duty of undivided fidelity and loyalty to a former client.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** The Supreme Court imposed a six-month suspension from the practice of law.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Attorney-Client Relationship with Maria:** While the Court focused on the conflict concerning Adela, the fact that the complaint was brought by Maria while the actual conflict occurred with Adela's cases could have been a basis for dismissal.
*   **Condonation Argument:** Since the IBP found that it was a first offense by the respondent it could have been a basis for dismissing the case.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **CPR, Canon 15, Rule 15.03:** Explicitly cited and violated.

Necessity and public interest require that this be so. Part of the lawyer's duty to his client is to avoid representing conflicting interests."
*   **Gonzales v. Cabucana, Jr., 515 Phil. 296, 304 (2006).** Stated that "Such prohibition is founded on principles of public policy and good taste as the nature of the lawyer-client relations is one of trust and confidence of the highest degree."

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Evangelista's representation of Spouses Valles against his former client, Adela Romero, without informed written consent, constituted a clear violation of ethical rules against conflicting interests. The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's finding of guilt but reduced the penalty to a six-month suspension, considering it was Atty. Evangelista's first offense.
