**Summary for Lawyer:**

This document is a Resolution of the Philippine Supreme Court in A.M. No. MTJ-07-1688 (Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 05-1763-MTJ), *Mariano v. Nacional*, finding Judge Jose P. Nacional guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure, violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, stemming from his handling of Civil Case No. 12334, an ejectment case governed by the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure (RRSP).

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Violation of RRSP (Sections 5 & 19(f)):** Judge Nacional ordered parties to submit "memoranda in the form of a court decision," expressly prohibited under the RRSP, which only allows the filing of complaints, compulsory counterclaims, cross-claims, and their respective answers.
*   **Violation of Rule 70, Section 11, ROC & Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of Code of Judicial Conduct & Section 5, Canon 6, New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judge Nacional decided the ejectment case 136 days after the required date, exceeding the 30-day period mandated by both the Rules of Court and the RRSP.
*   **Prior Admonishments:** Judge Nacional had a prior administrative record (Prado v. Judge Nacional & Abesa v. Judge Nacional), diminishing mitigating arguments based on his years of service.
*   **Violations of CPR (Canons 1 & 12, Rules 1.03, 10.03, 12.04):** By violating the RRSP and Rules of Court, Judge Nacional failed to uphold the law, assist in speedy administration of justice, or refrain from delaying cases or misusing court processes.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Adhere to RRSP:** Judges must strictly follow the RRSP in summary procedure cases.
*   **Obligation to Timely Decide Cases:** Judges must render judgments within the prescribed periods outlined in the Rules of Court and the Constitution.
*   **Liability for Ignorance of the Law:** Ignorance of basic procedural rules constitutes gross ignorance of the law and procedure, even without bad faith or malice (Basilia v. Becanon; Victory Liner, Inc. v. Bellosillo).
*   **Penalties:** Fined P40,000 for gross ignorance of the law; P20,000 for violating judicial conduct codes; and P10,000 for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility. Stern warning issued.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justification of Delay:** Judge's justifications for the delay (complex case, heavy caseload, voluminous documents) were rejected. Arguing complexity/volume of case, is no justification for violating clear rules and requires prior application for extension.
*   **Application of Prior Record:** The court used the prior admonishment to justify a harsher penalty.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RRSP, Sections 5, 19(f), 1(A)(1):** Govern pleadings and procedures in summary procedure cases.
*   **Rule 70, Section 11, ROC:** Dictates time for rendering judgment in ejectment cases.
*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.05, Code of Judicial Conduct (1989):** Mandates timely disposition of cases.
*   **Canon 6, Section 5, New Code of Judicial Conduct (A.M. No. 03-05-01-SC):** Requires efficient and prompt judicial duties.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision reinforces the strict application of procedural rules, particularly in summary procedure cases.
