**Legal Document Summary: *Ng Wee v. Tankiansee*, G.R. No. 171124, February 13, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the RTC's denial of the respondent's Motion to Discharge Preliminary Attachment.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Writ of Preliminary Attachment (WPA) was properly issued against Respondent Manuel Tankiansee based on allegations of fraud.

**Summary:**

Petitioner Ng Wee filed a complaint for damages against multiple parties, including Respondent Tankiansee (Vice-Chairman and Director of Wincorp), alleging fraudulent conduct related to Ng Wee's investment losses in Wincorp. Ng Wee obtained a WPA against the defendants' properties based on Sec. 1(d), Rule 57 of the Rules of Court (fraud in contracting the debt/incurring the obligation). Tankiansee moved to discharge the attachment, arguing its improper issuance and insufficient bond. The RTC denied the motion, but the CA reversed the RTC decision, lifting the WPA as to Tankiansee's properties, finding the allegations against him insufficient. This petition follows.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 1(d), Rule 57, Rules of Court:** Basis for the WPA, requiring proof of fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation. The court emphasizes the need to demonstrate an intent to defraud at the time of the agreement, not merely subsequent non-payment.
*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To sufficiently demonstrate the factual circumstances of fraud committed *by the Respondent* in his affidavit supporting the application for the WPA.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondent's Liability:** Hinges on establishing his direct participation and fraudulent intent in the alleged fraudulent transaction. The ruling clarifies that mere association or position within Wincorp is insufficient to impute fraud.
*   **Petitioner's Risk:** The WPA was lifted as to Tankiansee. The petitioner risks further sanctions if it can be demonstrated that the petition was frivolous or intended to harass the respondent. The court noted the harsh nature of preliminary attachment.
*   **Wincorp's Risk:** The outcome of the Ng Wee case is not affected in general, except for the fact that there is less property now covered by the issued writ.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 57, Sec. 1(d), Rules of Court:**  Critical statutory provision governing the issuance of a WPA based on fraud.
*   **Liberty Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 104405, May 13, 1993, 222 SCRA 37:** Clarifies the requirement of demonstrating fraudulent intent at the time of contracting the debt.
*   **Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Dy, G.R. No. 156887, October 3, 2005, 472 SCRA 1:** reiterates that fraudulent intent cannot be inferred from the debtor’s mere non-payment of the debt or failure to comply with his obligation.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Affidavit lacked "any factual statement that respondent committed a fraud". The court viewed the allegations against Tankiansee as general and lacking specific details of his participation in the fraud.
*   Petitioner relied on a previous CA decision regarding co-defendants which the court deemed inadmissible for the reason of not involving the respondent.

**Potential Arguments/Next Steps:**

*   **Petitioner's Potential Argument (Unlikely to Succeed):**  Attempt to amend the complaint and/or affidavit to include more specific allegations of fraud against Tankiansee.  However, the court emphasized the strict construction against applicants for preliminary attachment.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent’s legal team would be prudent to file a claim for damages, particularly considering that the preliminary attachment, as ruled by the SC, was improperly granted.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision lifting the WPA against Respondent Tankiansee, finding that Petitioner Ng Wee failed to sufficiently demonstrate factual circumstances of fraud directly attributable to him. The Court emphasized that fraud must be proven with specificity and cannot be inferred solely from an individual's position within a company or general allegations of connivance. This ruling underscores the strict requirements for issuing preliminary attachments based on fraud.
