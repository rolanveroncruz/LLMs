## Legal Document Summary: Floyd & Calixtro v. Gonzales, et al. (G.R. No. 169047)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC dismissal of an injunction complaint filed by petitioners Floyd and Calixtro to prevent the demolition of their houses.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioners are bound by the decision in the Ejectment case and whether the writ of injunction should be made permanent

**Facts:**

*   Respondents Nisperos et al. won an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 139-0-86) against Abarnas regarding a 1,337.50 sq. meter property. The decision became final.
*   Petitioners Floyd and Calixtro, occupants of portions of the same land, filed an injunction suit (SP. Civil Action No. 234-0-91) to prevent demolition after the issuance of Alias Writs of Execution and Demolition in the ejectment case. They were not parties to the original ejectment action.
*   Petitioners claim they occupied the land in 1986 and 1988.
*   Respondents claim that the Petitioners are privies of the Abarnases and the judgement in the ejectment case should be held against them

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *affirmed* the CA decision ordering petitioners to surrender possession and remove improvements.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Order to Surrender Possession:** Petitioners Floyd and Calixtro are required to surrender possession of the land to respondents Linda, Lilian, and Salvador Nisperos.
*   **Order to Remove Improvements:** Petitioners are obligated to remove the houses and any other improvements they introduced on the disputed land.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Costs:** Petitioners are responsible for paying the costs associated with the legal proceedings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** The Nisperoses can now enforce the judgment, including the demolition of petitioners' houses.
*   **Lack of Compensation:** The decision does not provide for any compensation or relocation assistance for the petitioners.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Equitable PCI Bank v. Ku, G.R. No. 142950, March 26, 2001, 355 SCRA 309, 312:** Cites the exceptions under which non-parties can be bound by an ejectment judgment (trespassers, squatters, agents, etc.)
*   **Tan v. Mueco, G.R. No. 141540, October 26, 2001, 368 SCRA 429, 435:** Discusses the requirements for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.
*   **Pajuyo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 146364, June 3, 2004, 430 SCRA 492:** Explains the nature of ejectment proceedings and the issue of prior possession.
*   **Sec. 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court:** Deals with issues not raised by the pleadings are tried with the express or implied consent of the parties

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Privity:** The court found the petitioners to be successors-in-interest of Abarnas. The degree of proof supporting this finding is a potential point of contention, particularly given the lack of formal documentation establishing a clear legal link.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The Supreme Court emphasized that ejectment suits are actions *in personam*, and that Petitioners' right to due process was violated in the original ejectment proceeding.
*   The judgment hinged on the determination of *prior possession* (*possessio prior in tempore, potior est in jure*) rather than title, which is standard in ejectment cases.
