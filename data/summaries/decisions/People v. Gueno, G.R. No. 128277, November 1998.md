**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gueno*** (G.R. No. 128277, November 16, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of convictions for violation of Sections 4 and 8 of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 37-95 (Section 4 Violation - Sale of Marijuana):** Ferdinand Gueno and Florida Fajardo were convicted of selling 30.4315 grams of marijuana to a poseur buyer (P01 Camantigue) in a buy-bust operation.
*   **Criminal Case No. 38-95 (Section 8 Violation - Possession of Marijuana):** Gueno was convicted of possessing 861.5842 grams of marijuana, found during a search pursuant to a search warrant executed after the buy-bust operation.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented testimony from police officers (including the poseur buyer) detailing the buy-bust operation and the subsequent search.  The seized marijuana was presented as evidence and tested positive by the NBI.  Defense presented an alibi, claiming Gueno was not present during the sale and that the marijuana was planted.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Convicted Gueno and Fajardo in Criminal Case No. 37-95 (sale). Convicted Gueno in Criminal Case No. 38-95 (possession).
*   **Penalty:** In Crim. Case No. 37-95, both were sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of four (4) months and twenty (20) days of arresto mayor maximum as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional medium as maximum. In Crim. Case No. 38-95, Cueno was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of P500,000.00.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

1.  Lack of Credibility of Prosecution Witnesses
2.  Insufficiency of Evidence to Prove Guilt Beyond Reasonable Doubt

**Court's Holding:** Affirmed the trial court's decision. The appeal failed.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Gueno is obligated to serve the *reclusion perpetua* sentence and pay the P500,000 fine for the Section 8 violation.
*   Gueno is obligated to serve the indeterminate prison term and pay costs for the Section 4 violation.
*   Gueno is liable for violating Sections 4 and 8 of R.A. 6425, as amended.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Search Warrant Execution:** The search warrant was applied for *prior* to the buy-bust operation, based on surveillance. The legality of the search, given its proximity in time to the buy-bust, could potentially be challenged further, although the court found it was a lawful search incident to the lawful arrest.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The document is not entirely clear about the chain of custody of the drugs, though the court seems to suggest that it was established adequately.
*   **"Frame Up" Defense:**  The defense of a frame up typically requires convincing proof of ill intent on behalf of the police officers but in this case, the court found that the evidence supporting the prosecution was overwhelming
*   **Defense Weaknesses:** Alibi and 'frame-up' defenses were uncorroborated and deemed insufficient to overcome positive identification and the presumption of regularity.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), Sections 4 and 8, as amended.
*   Republic Act 7659 (amendatory provisions of Republic Act 6425)
*   Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Section 3, Rule 122

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Saley* (G.R. 121179, 02 July 1998): Appellate jurisdiction over cases with lower penalties when offenses arise from the same occurrence.
*   *People vs. Rigodon*, 238 SCRA 27: Elements of illegal drug sale.
*   *People vs. Zervoulakos*, 241 SCRA 625: Elements of illegal drug sale.
*   *People v. Manahan*, 238 SCRA 141: Failure to mark buy-bust money is not material.
*   *People vs. Cuachon*, s38 SCRA 540: Presentation in evidence of buy-bust money is not indispensable for the conviction of the accused as long as the sale can be adequately proved in some other way by the prosecution.
*   *People vs. Manzano*, 227 SCRA 780: Elements of the offense with which he was charged were present
*   *People v. Juatan*, 260 SCRA 532: Validity of buy-bust operations.
*   *People v. Lua*, 256 SCRA 539: Warrantless search incident to lawful arrest.
*   *Duran vs. Court of Appeals*, (71 SCRA 68): Facts susceptible to two interpretations, one consistent and the other inconsistent with the guilt of the accused
*   *People v. Ponsica*, 230 SCRA 87: The court, here again, holds that in the absence of proof of any odious intent on the part of the police authorities to falsely impute a serious crime, such as that made against herein appellant, the Court will not allow their testimony to be overcome by the self-serving and uncorroborated claim of "frame-up."
*   *People v. Simon*, 234 SCRA 555: Regarding sentencing under the Dangerous Drugs Act.

**Overall Assessment:** The court strongly affirmed the conviction based on the credibility of the police officers, the positive identification of the accused, and the lack of compelling evidence supporting the defense's claims of alibi and frame-up.  The decision highlights the difficulty of overcoming the presumption of regularity in police operations.
