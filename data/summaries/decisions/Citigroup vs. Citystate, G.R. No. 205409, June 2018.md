**Case:** *Citigroup, Inc. vs. Citystate Savings Bank, Inc.*, G.R. No. 205409, June 13, 2018 (833 Phil. 168)

**Summary:** This is a trademark dispute where Citigroup, Inc. (Citigroup) opposed Citystate Savings Bank, Inc.'s (Citystate) application to register the trademark "CITY CASH WITH GOLDEN LION'S HEAD" for its ATM services. Citigroup argued the mark was confusingly similar to its "CITI" family of trademarks. The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) initially sided with Citigroup, but the Director General reversed, allowing Citystate's application. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Director General's decision. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately DENIED Citigroup's petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' ruling that no confusing similarity exists between the marks.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Trademark in Question:** Citystate's "CITY CASH WITH GOLDEN LION'S HEAD" for ATM services. Citigroup's concern is with the 'CITY' portion being too similar to their 'CITI' trademark.
*   **Dominancy Test:** The SC applied the dominancy test, focusing on the main, essential, and dominant features of the marks. The Court found Citystate's dominant feature was the Golden Lion's head device.
*   **Holistic Test:** The SC also considered the context and entirety of the marks.
*   **Lack of Similarity:** The SC found the dissimilarities between the marks "noticeable and substantial," especially the Golden Lion's Head. Also noting that Citigroup trademarks have variable styles of the "CITI" mark.
*   **Ordinary Purchaser:** The SC adopted the "ordinarily intelligent buyer" standard, emphasizing that ATM services require opening an account with a bank, and the bank's name is prominently displayed.
*   **Sec. 123 of the Intellectual Property Code:** Cited as the basis for opposing registration, specifically likelihood of deception or confusion.
*   **Absence of Confusion:** The SC held no likelihood of confusion existed, considering the prominent Golden Lion's Head device, the context of ATM services requiring bank account ownership, and the intelligent buyer standard.
* **Petitioner's Argument:** Citigroup argued that the mark could be used outside the bank premises, such as in radio, newspapers, and the internet, where there would not necessarily be a "GOLDEN LION'S HEAD" symbol to disambiguate the mark from any of petitioner's marks. The Supreme Court rejected this argument.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *La Chemise Lacoste, S.A. v. Fernandez* (214 Phil. 332 (1984)): Purpose of trademark protection.
*   *Mirpuri v. Court of Appeals* (376 Phil. 628 (1999)): Historical development of trademark law.
*   *Coffee Partners, Inc. v. San Francisco Coffee & Roastery, Inc.* (628 Phil. 13 (2010)): Explanation of the dominancy and holistic tests.
*   *Emerald Manufacturing Company v. Court of Appeals* (321 Phil. 1001 (1995)): Addressed the standard of the 'ordinary purchaser'.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Narrow Interpretation:** The decision could be interpreted narrowly, applying only to the specific facts of the case, particularly the ATM services context.
*   **Future Disputes:** Citigroup could still pursue infringement actions if Citystate uses its mark in ways that create actual confusion in the marketplace, particularly in advertising.
*   **Disclaimed Word:** The Court mentions that 'Cash' was disclaimed in the trademark application. Arguing that the word 'City' appears nearly identical to 'Citi'.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 8293, the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines.
*   Section 123 of the Intellectual Property Code

**Conclusion:** Citystate prevailed due to the distinguishing Golden Lion's Head device and the context of the ATM services. Citigroup's risks are limited, but potential infringement claims remain if actual confusion arises. The decision underscores the importance of considering the "ordinarily intelligent buyer" and the specific context when assessing trademark similarity.
