**Case Summary: People v. Dela Peña, Jr., G.R. No. 183567 (2009)**

**Subject:** Appeal of a murder conviction. Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which itself affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659).
*   **Accusation:** Avelino dela Peña, Jr. shot Danilo Sareño with an illegally possessed .38 caliber revolver, with intent to kill and with treachery, resulting in Sareño's death.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Maria, the victim's wife, identified Dela Peña as the shooter. She saw him through a window near the stove, aiming a gun at Sareño while he was scooping rice.
*   **Cause of Death:** Cardiorespiratory arrest due to a gunshot wound to the back, hitting the right ventricle of the heart, causing massive hemorrhage. The recovered slug matched the wound.
*   **Defense:** Dela Peña claimed alibi (at Eddie Limod's house) and alleged that his brother, Eldred, was the real shooter. Gonzalo Sareño (victim's father) testified that he saw Eldred fleeing the scene.
*   **RTC Holding:** Guilty of Murder; sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua*; ordered to pay P50,000 as indemnity.
*   **CA Holding:** Affirmed RTC conviction, with modification adding P50,000 in moral damages and P25,000 in exemplary damages, in addition to civil indemnity.
*   **SC Holding:** Affirmed CA decision. Prosecution proved guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Dela Peña:** Liable for the death of Danilo Sareño. Obligated to serve *Reclusion Perpetua* and pay civil indemnity (P50,000), moral damages (P50,000) and exemplary damages (P25,000).
*   **State:** Duty to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecution met this burden through the testimony of the victim's wife.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The defense attempted to impeach Maria's testimony, but both lower courts found her to be credible and the Supreme Court agreed.
*   **Alibi & Conflicting Testimony:** The conflicting testimonies of Dela Peña, Limod, and the victim's father (Gonzalo) were deemed not credible or persuasive by the trial court, and the SC found no reason to overturn this.
*   **Treachery:** The finding of treachery (alevosia) is the element that elevates the crime to murder. The SC upheld this, based on the suddenness of the attack and the victim's position when shot.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (Murder)**
*   **R.A. 7659 (Amendments to the Revised Penal Code regarding heinous crimes)**
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 640 (transfer of cases to CA)**
*   **Case Law on Witness Credibility, Alibi, and Treachery** Specific citations within the case (e.g., People v. Zeta, People v. Cariño, People v. Bagsit) address these issues, affirming established principles that a single credible eyewitness is sufficient for conviction, that relationship alone doesn't impute bias, and that positive identification outweighs unsubstantiated alibi.

**Ambiguities:**

*   There are no glaring ambiguities. The issue boiled down to witness credibility and the interpretation of the facts surrounding the shooting.

**Note:** This case primarily hinges on the positive identification by a single, credible eyewitness and the finding of treachery. The alibi presented by the defense was weak and not substantiated.
