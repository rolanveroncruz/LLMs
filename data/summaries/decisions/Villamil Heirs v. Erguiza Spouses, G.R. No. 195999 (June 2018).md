Okay, here's a legal summary of the Villamil v. Erguiza case, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Lily S. Villamil v. Spouses Juanito Erguiza and Mila Erguiza*, G.R. No. 195999, June 20, 2018 (833 Phil. 686)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision reversing the RTC and MTCC decisions in an action for recovery of possession.

**Facts:**

*   Lily Villamil (Petitioner) filed a complaint for recovery of possession against Spouses Erguiza (Respondents) based on a 1972 agreement where Villamil *et al.* promised to sell land to Erguiza. The initial payment was made.

*   A key clause stipulated that the sale was conditional upon securing court approval for the sale of shares belonging to minor co-owners. If such approval was denied, the initial payment would be considered rent for 20 years.

*   Instead of seeking court approval, Villamil consolidated ownership by acquiring the shares of her co-owners.

*   After 20 years from agreement, Villamil demanded the property back, claiming the agreement had become a lease and the term expired, without offering to complete the sale.

**Holding/Key Provisions & Analysis:**

1.  **Contract to Sell:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding that the 1972 agreement was a *contract to sell* not a *contract of sale.* Ownership was expressly reserved by the sellers (Villamil *et al.*), and the transfer of title was contingent on a suspensive condition (court approval). *Coronel v. Court of Appeals*, 331 Phil. 294 (1996) was cited to distinguish the two.

2.  **Constructive Fulfillment:** The Court applied Article 1186 of the Civil Code.  Villamil prevented the fulfillment of the suspensive condition by consolidating ownership instead of pursuing court approval for the minor owners' shares.  The intent to prevent fulfillment and the actual prevention were both present. She is deemed to have constructively fulfilled the condition.  *International Hotel Corporation v. Joaquin, Jr.*, 708 Phil. 361 (2013) cited.

3.  **Breach and Obligation:** By preventing the condition from being met, Villamil triggered the Erguizas' obligation to pay the remaining balance. However, Villamil *never* tendered performance by offering to execute a deed of absolute sale after consolidating ownership. The buyers' (Erguizas) obligation to pay balance only arises with the seller's compliance with the suspensive condition (*Article 1181 of the New Civil Code*).

4.  **No Lease Conversion:** The provision stating conversion to lease was deemed inapplicable because the trigger (court disapproval of the sale) never occurred since no court petition was ever filed.

5.  **Possession:** Because the contract to sell remained unconsummated due to Villamil's failure to tender performance, the Erguizas retained the right to possess the property. Villamil's claim for recovery of possession failed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Villamil (or her heirs):** Obligation to execute a deed of absolute sale and transfer ownership to Erguiza, subject to Erguiza tendering the remaining balance of the purchase price. Failure to execute the deed of sale, Villamil is liable for breach of the obligations of a contract to sell.
*   **Erguiza:**  Obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price upon Villamil's tender of a deed of absolute sale.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Laches:** The case spans decades. The doctrine of laches might be argued to prevent enforcement, given the long period of inactivity. However, the Court focused on the failure of the *seller* to perform, arguably justifying the delay on the buyer's part.
*   **Specific Performance Suit:** Erguiza could file a suit for specific performance to compel Villamil (or her heirs) to execute the deed of absolute sale.
*   **Current Value:** The original purchase price (₱5,157.00) may no longer be equitable given inflation and property value appreciation. This could be a point of contention if specific performance is sought. *Equitable considerations* may be factored into the final remedy, even if legal rights favor Erguiza.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 1181, New Civil Code (Conditional Obligations)
*   Article 1186, New Civil Code (Constructive Fulfillment of Condition)
*   Article 1458, Civil Code (Contract of Sale)

**Case Law:**

*   *Coronel v. Court of Appeals*, 331 Phil. 294 (1996) – Distinguishes Contract of Sale from Contract to Sell.
*   *International Hotel Corporation v. Joaquin, Jr.*, 708 Phil. 361 (2013) – Application of Constructive Fulfillment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly found that the agreement was a contract to sell and that Villamil had constructively fulfilled the suspensive condition. The Court prioritized legal precedent and statutory interpretation over strict contractual wording. The case highlights the importance of tendering performance and fulfilling contractual obligations in good faith. While legal title currently favors Villamil due to her consolidation of the property under her name, equitable possession and the right to purchase favors Erguiza due to Villamil's breach of obligation to sell.
