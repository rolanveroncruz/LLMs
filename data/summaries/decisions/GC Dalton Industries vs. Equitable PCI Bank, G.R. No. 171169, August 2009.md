Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *GC Dalton Industries, Inc. vs. Equitable PCI Bank*:

**Case:** GC Dalton Industries, Inc. v. Equitable PCI Bank, G.R. No. 171169, August 24, 2009.

**Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the RTC's order granting Equitable PCI Bank's (EPCIB) ex parte motion for a writ of possession over properties extrajudicially foreclosed due to the default of Camden Industries, Inc. (CII), for which GC Dalton Industries, Inc. (GCDI) acted as a third-party mortgagor.

**Facts:**

*   EPCIB extended a credit line to CII, secured by a third-party mortgage over GCDI's properties and a hold-out agreement on CII's savings account.
*   CII defaulted, leading EPCIB to extrajudicially foreclose on GCDI's properties in Bulacan. EPCIB was the highest bidder.
*   GCDI's titles were cancelled, and new titles were issued to EPCIB.
*   EPCIB filed an ex parte motion for a writ of possession in the Bulacan RTC.
*   Prior to the issuance, CII filed a separate action for specific performance and damages in the Pasig RTC, alleging full payment. The Pasig RTC initially ruled in favor of CII, ordering EPCIB to return overpayments, lost profits, and TCTs, and awarding damages and attorney's fees. The RTC also dismissed EPCIB's appeal for non-payment of fees.
*   GCDI opposed the writ of possession in the Bulacan RTC, citing the Pasig RTC decision and alleging fraud/forum-shopping. The Bulacan RTC granted the writ.
*   GCDI filed a certiorari petition with the CA, which was dismissed.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied GCDI's petition and upheld the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Third-Party Mortgage:** GCDI's mortgage of its properties secured CII's debt to EPCIB. This creates a direct obligation for GCDI to permit foreclosure upon CII's default.
*   **Hold-out Agreement:** CII authorized EPCIB to deduct amounts due from its savings account.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** EPCIB validly exercised its right to extrajudicially foreclose on GCDI's properties upon CII's default under Act No. 3135, as amended.
*   **Right of Redemption:** CII, as a juridical person, had a limited right of redemption under Section 47 of the General Banking Law (prior to amendments by RA 8791) expiring upon registration of the certificate of sale, which occurred.
*   **Writ of Possession:** EPCIB was entitled to a writ of possession as a matter of right following the expiration of the redemption period and consolidation of title.
*   **Remedy Under Section 8 of Act 3135:** GCDI had 30 days after EPCIB was given possession to petition the court to set aside the sale.  Failure to do so waived this right.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **GCDI's Liability:** GCDI is liable to have its mortgaged properties sold to satisfy CII's debt to EPCIB.
*   **EPCIB's Risk:** Although granted the writ of possession, EPCIB is still subject to the outcome of the appeal from the Pasig RTC decision.
* **Risk of Forum Shopping** EPCIB was found to potentially be forum shopping by the Pasig court for filing for the writ of possession while the case in Pasig was on going.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure.  Section 8 provides for the remedy of petitioning to set aside the sale.
*   **Section 47 of the General Banking Law:** Addresses foreclosure of real estate mortgages and redemption periods for juridical persons (prior to amendments by RA 8791).
*   **Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution:** Addresses requirements for court decisions.
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:** The decision cites cases establishing the ministerial nature of the writ of possession and the limited recourse for mortgagors.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Conflict Between RTC Decisions:** The primary contention revolves around the conflict between the Pasig RTC decision (finding CII overpaid) and the Bulacan RTC order (granting the writ of possession). The Supreme Court essentially prioritizes the ministerial nature of the writ of possession over the merits of the Pasig RTC case *at this stage*.
*   **Pasig RTC Appeal:** The Pasig RTC's initial dismissal of EPCIB's appeal was partially reconsidered. The outcome of that appeal in the Court of Appeals is critical, as it could impact EPCIB's right to retain the foreclosed properties.
*   **Forum Shopping:** While the Bulacan court did not address the forum shopping issue, the Pasig court initially found EPCIB to have engaged in forum shopping. This would create additional liability for EPCIB should they lose their appeal.

**Note:** The analysis is based solely on the provided text and does not account for subsequent events or rulings. The status of the Pasig RTC appeal is a key factor that needs to be checked for any final analysis.
