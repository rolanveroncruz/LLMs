## Summary of *Conrado G. Fernandez v. Atty. Maria Angelica P. De Ramos-Villalon*, A.C. No. 7084

This is an administrative case for disbarment filed by Conrado G. Fernandez against Atty. Maria Angelica P. De Ramos-Villalon based on alleged violations of the Canons of Professional Responsibility.

**Key Facts:**

*   Fernandez was the respondent in a civil case (Civil Case No. 05-1017) brought by Palacios seeking to nullify a Deed of Donation purportedly executed in Fernandez's favor.
*   Atty. Villalon initially represented Palacios in the civil case but withdrew after becoming a prosecutor.
*   Fernandez alleges Atty. Villalon suppressed information about a Deed of Absolute Sale in the civil case, used a purportedly fake Deed of Donation to deceive the court, misrepresented facts in a letter requesting notarial records, refused to receive Fernandez's answer, induced a witness (Heredia) to sign a false affidavit, and only submitted the Deed of Donation for NBI examination.

**Key Provisions & Alleged Violations:**

*   **Rule 1.01:** Engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Rule 7.03:** Engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice law.
*   **Rule 10.01:** Committing falsehood or misleading the court.
*   **Rule 10.02:** Misrepresenting the contents of documents or facts.
*   **Rule 10.03:** Misusing rules of procedure to defeat the ends of justice.

**IBP Recommendation:**

*   The IBP Commissioner recommended dismissal of the case, finding no sufficient basis to hold Atty. Villalon accountable. The Commissioner stated that a lawyer does not need to bring up matters of defense for the opposing side and that the Deed of Absolute Sale was publicly available.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's recommendation and dismissed the disbarment complaint.
*   The Court held that a lawyer is not obligated to build the case for the opponent. Atty. Villalon's duty was to advance her client's interests, and the existence of the Deed of Absolute Sale was a matter of defense for Fernandez to raise.
*   The Court found the Deed of Absolute Sale was not the document that was used to transfer the Title, making it less relevant to Atty. Villalon's objectives.
*   The Court viewed Heredia's retraction of her affidavit with caution, finding both the original affidavit and the retraction to be uncorroborated and of doubtful credibility.  No clear and convincing evidence of improper inducement was presented.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** The Court emphasizes the lack of corroborating evidence for both the original affidavit and its retraction, highlighting the difficulty of proving the allegations against Atty. Villalon.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court questions the credibility of Heredia, suggesting she may have lied in both affidavits. This could have implications for future cases relying on her testimony.
*   **Duty of Candor vs. Client Advocacy:** The case underscores the tension between a lawyer's duty of candor to the court and their duty to zealously represent their client. The Court reaffirms that zealous representation does not require advancing the opponent's defense.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Marcelo v. Javier, A.C. No. 3248, September 18, 1992, 214 SCRA 1* (Duty to be truthful)
*   *People v. Navarro, G.R. No. 129566, October 7, 1998, 297 SCRA 331* (Retractions viewed with caution)
*   *Berbano v. Barcelona, A.C. No. 6084, September 3, 2003, 410 SCRA 258* (Burden of proof in disbarment)
*   *Concepcion v. Fandi√±o, Jr., A.C. No. 3677, June 21, 2000, 334 SCRA 137* (Clear, convincing, and satisfactory proof required for disbarment)

**Conclusion:**

The Court ultimately sided with the Respondent, Atty. Villalon.
