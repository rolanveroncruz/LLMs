*   **Speedy Trial Rights:** Tan argued for dismissal based on a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.
*   **Duty to Prosecute:** The State had a duty to prosecute the case within a reasonable time, subject to statutory limits (Speedy Trial Act of 1998; Rule 119, Section 2 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure) and considerations of "good cause" for delays.
*   **Non-Forum Shopping Certificate:** The validity of the DOJ Secretary signing the certificate of non-forum shopping on behalf of the People of the Philippines was challenged.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Tan faces potential penalties under the Revised Securities Act if convicted. (Section 56: fine of not less than five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos nor more than five hundred thousand (P500,000.00) pesos or imprisonment of not less than seven (7) years nor more than twenty one (21) years, or both in the discretion of the court).
*   **Prosecution Risk:** The reinstatement of the case exposes Tan to the risk of continued prosecution and potential conviction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Implied Consent:** The Court heavily relied on the lack of *objection* by Tan's counsel to the separate trials as constituting *implied consent* to the delay in Criminal Case No. 119830. This could be argued as a weak basis for waiver of a constitutional right, especially if no explicit agreement was documented.
*   **Waiver of Right to Speedy Trial:** The Court stated that Tan deemed to have acquiesced and waived his objection thereto. It can be argued that this constitutes ineffective defense because the mistakes would result in serious injustice.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Tan can argue that the court abused its discretion by relying on an unsubstantiated claim of separate trial and that no due diligence was put into the matter.

**Potential Risks and Next Steps:**

*   Tan now faces the full resumption of Criminal Case No. 119830.
*   The strength of the prosecution's evidence in Criminal Case No. 119830 needs to be thoroughly assessed to determine the likelihood of conviction.
*   Consider filing a Motion for Reconsideration based on grave abuse of discretion of the Supreme Court for ineffective defense.
*   Thoroughly analyze the trial transcripts to ascertain the extent and effectiveness of Tan's defense and whether there are grounds for ineffective assistance of counsel claims, given the reliance on implied consent.
