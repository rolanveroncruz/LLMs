**Legal Document Summary: Abacus Capital and Investment Corporation vs. Dr. Ernesto G. Tabujara (G.R. No. 197624)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision that held Abacus liable for Tabujara's investment loss.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Investment Agreement:** Tabujara engaged Abacus as lending agent to invest P3,000,000.00. Abacus lent this to IFSC (formerly CIPI).
*   **Confirmation of Investment:** Abacus issued this to Tabujara, detailing loan terms (principal, interest, maturity date). This is a crucial piece of evidence pointing to Abacus' role.
*   **IFSC's Suspension of Payments/Rehabilitation:** IFSC filed for suspension of payments shortly after the investment, leading to non-payment of Tabujara's investment.
*   **Abacus's Role:** Abacus claims to be merely a collecting/paying agent. Court found that Abacus was a fund supplier to IFSC for a P700M credit line facility and used Tabujara's investment in it. Abacus proposed assigning rehabilitation plan proceeds to Tabujara.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Abacus's Liability:** The CA reversed the RTC and found Abacus liable to Tabujara for the principal amount of the investment (P3,000,000.00), interest, and damages. SC affirmed.
*   **Rationale:** The SC characterized the transaction as a money market placement. Since the loaned amount (Tabujara's investment) was not repaid with interest, Tabujara may recover from Abacus.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Abacus bears risk as middleman:** Abacus's liability as the middleman in the money market transaction. *Sesbreno v. CA* (310 Phil. 671 (1995))* solidifies the liability of the middleman (Abacus) when the borrower fails to repay.
*   **Fraud:** The CA and the SC suggested possible fraud on Abacus's part for lending to IFSC despite its known financial instability. This could raise further implications for Abacus.
*   **Precedent:** This case could set a precedent for investment houses/lending agents being held liable for investment losses, especially when they have a closer relationship with the borrower (e.g., credit line facility).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 129:** Defines investment houses and underwriting.
*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Defines securities.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Perez v. CA*** (212 Phil. 587 (1984)): Defines money market transactions. This case is central to establishing the nature of the transaction and Abacus's role.
*   ***Sesbreno v. CA*** (310 Phil. 671 (1995)): States money market placement partakes of the nature of loan.
*   ***Sesbre√±o v. Court of Appeals*** (294 Phil. 445 (1993)):  Highlights the need to protect the general public investing in money markets.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames*** (716 Phil. 267 (2013)): Dictates the applicable interest rates on judgments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Abacus's "Agent" vs. "Principal" Role:** The central dispute revolved around whether Abacus acted solely as an agent or if it assumed a greater role as a principal lender. The courts determined that Abacus acted as the latter given it extended a credit line to IFSC using investor's money.
*   **"Fund Supplier":** Court found that Abacus was the "fund supplier" for the credit line facility, meaning that Abacus had the resources (from various sources). The court concluded that Abacus should bear more liability than a simple agent would.

**Conclusion:**

Abacus was found liable for Tabujara's investment loss because the court characterized the transaction as a money market placement where Abacus was more than just a middleman; it acted as a fund supplier to IFSC and stood to gain from the loan agreement between them. The judgment includes the principal investment amount, interest, and damages, as well as a modification to the interest rates according to *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*.
