## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Heirs of Gotengco (G.R. No. 226355)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision and Resolution which upheld the RTC's amendment of a final and executory Modified Partial Decision in an expropriation case.

**Facts:** Republic expropriated land belonging to Gotengco et al. for the South Luzon Expressway. The RTC issued a Modified Partial Decision fixing just compensation but did not include legal interest. This decision became final and executory. Nine years later, Gotengco moved for the payment of accrued interest, which the RTC granted, amending the final decision to include 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment. The CA affirmed, citing *Apo Fruits* and the need for prompt payment for just compensation to be truly "just."

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Modified Partial Decision:** Republic ordered to pay specified amounts as just compensation for expropriated land (Table II: Gotengco - P26,245,860.00) without interest.
*   **RTC Amendment (Order dated May 6, 2013):** Republic ordered to pay 6% legal interest per annum from the date of finality of the judgment until full payment of just compensation.
* Compromise agreement: Gotengco and Tiaoqui were to share the remainder of the just compensation amounting to P5,576,340.00

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original:** Republic liable for the principal amount of just compensation.
*   **Amended:** Republic liable for the principal amount *plus* legal interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The RTC's amendment of the final decision creates a potential liability for interest not originally contemplated, impacting the Republic's financial obligations. This also sets a precedent for potentially reopening final expropriation judgments.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review.
*   **Rule 67, Section 10 of the Rules of Court:**  Cited by the CA regarding the matter of law and against public policy to not impose legal interest.
*   ***Apo Fruits Corporation and Hijo Plantation, Inc. v. Land Bank of the Philippines***: CA relied on this case to justify the modification of a final judgment to include legal interest. The Supreme Court distinguished this case.
*   ***Republic v. CA***: Cited by the CA, referring to *Apo Fruits* that for just compensation to be considered "just", the payment must be prompt and there must be necessity of the payment of interest to compensate for any delay in the payment of compensation for property already taken.
*   ***Urtula v. Republic***: Supreme Court cited this case to prove that Gotengco is already barred by res judicata to claim legal interest for failure to timely raise his objection thereto.
*   **Principles of Immutability of Judgments:** The core legal issue is whether the RTC could amend a final judgment. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of this doctrine and its limited exceptions.
*   **Estoppel by Laches:**  Gotengco's delay of nine years in asserting his claim for interest is considered laches, barring his claim. Section 3, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of any explicit provision for interest in the original Modified Partial Decision created the dispute, opening the door for the subsequent amendment and legal challenge.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the original Modified Partial Decision (no interest). The Court held that the *Apo Fruits* doctrine is not applicable due to Gotengco's delay in claiming interest (laches). The Court also held the ruling in *Urtula v. Republic*, that Gotengco is already barred by res judicata to claim legal interest for failure to timely raise his objection thereto. The Court emphasized the importance of the principle of immutability of judgements.

**Implications for lawyer:** Client can refer to the jurisprudence of Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), petitioner, vs. Heirs of Cirilo Gotengco, respondents (G.R. No. 226355, January 24, 2018) and Urtula v. Republic to prove that the client is barred to claim legal interest due to failure to timely raise his objection.
