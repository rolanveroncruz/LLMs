**Case Summary: *Quasha Ancheta Pe√±a and Nolasco Law Office v. LCN Construction Corp.* (G.R. No. 174873, August 26, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision regarding payment of administrator's fees, attorney's fees, and advance distribution of estate shares in a special proceedings case for the intestate estate of Raymond Triviere.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Administrator's Fees (Atty. Syquia & Atty. Quasha (deceased)):** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed that the RTC is authorized to determine and approve reasonable administrator's fees payable to Attorneys Enrique P. Syquia and William H. Quasha chargeable to the estate for their services as co-administrators.
    *   **Legal Basis:** Section 7, Rule 85 of the Rules of Court (ROC).
*   **Attorney's Fees (Quasha Law Office):** The SC reversed the CA's ruling and granted Quasha Law Office attorney's fees of P100,000.00 for legal services rendered to the Triviere children, to be sourced from their shares of the estate. This ruling was based on the finding that, despite initially claiming to be a co-administrator, the firm was ultimately determined to only be a counsel for the children.
    *   **Legal Basis:** General principles of attorney-client agreements and reasonable compensation for legal services. This is not covered by the prohibition in the third paragraph of Section 7, Rule 85 of the Revised Rules of Court since there was no formal substitution as the co-administrator of the estate.
*   **Advance Distribution of Estate:** The SC affirmed the CA's deletion of the shares awarded to the heirs (children and widow) prior to full settlement of obligations.
    *   **Legal Basis:** Section 1, Rule 90 of the ROC, which prohibits distribution of the residue until all debts, funeral charges, expenses of administration, allowances, and inheritance taxes have been paid or provided for.
    *   **SC Reasoning:** While advance distribution is permissible under Section 2, Rule 109 and Section 1 Rule 90, a bond and consideration of the assets not affected by the controversy or appeal are required, which were not met in this case. The outstanding claim of LCN, exceeding the estate's value, further justified the disallowance.
    *   **Case Law:** *Dael v. Intermediate Appellate Court* (G.R. No. 68873, 31 March 1989) was distinguished, as that case involved sufficient assets and no outstanding obligations.
*   **LCN's Claim:** The SC explicitly states that the merits of LCN's claim against the estate are pending determination by the RTC. It refuses to award LCN any specific amount at this juncture.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Administrators (or their estates) are entitled to reasonable compensation for services rendered in administering the estate, as determined by the RTC.
*   Quasha Law Office is entitled to attorney's fees for legal services rendered to the children, but these fees are to be paid by the children from their respective shares of the estate.
*   No distribution of residue is allowed until all claims, including that of LCN, are resolved and paid or provided for. Heirs may be required to post a bond for the payment of obligations.
*   The RTC has the duty to determine the merits of LCN's claim against the estate.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Services:** The precise amount of administrator's fees owed to Attorneys Syquia and Quasha requires determination by the RTC. This could lead to further disputes.
*   **LCN's Claim:** The ultimate value and validity of LCN's claim remain unresolved, impacting the final distribution of the estate. If LCN's claim exceeds the estate's assets, the heirs will receive nothing.
*   **Bond Requirement:** To expedite distribution to the heirs, the RTC may require a bond to cover LCN's potential claim. The amount of the bond and the heirs' ability to provide it are potential issues.
*   **Conflicting Roles:** The shifting positions of Quasha Law Office (administrator vs. counsel) created procedural and credibility issues.
*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The interpretation and application of Rules 85, 90, and 109 of the Rules of Court were central to the court's decision, highlighting the importance of procedural compliance and proper documentation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Rules of Court, Rules 78, 82, 85 (Sections 7 & 8), 90 (Section 1), and 109 (Section 2)
