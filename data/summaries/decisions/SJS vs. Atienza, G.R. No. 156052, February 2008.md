## Legal Document Summary: Social Justice Society v. Atienza, Jr. (G.R. No. 156052)

**Nature:** Resolution regarding motions for intervention and reconsideration of a prior decision compelling the Mayor of Manila to enforce Ordinance No. 8027.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Ordinance No. 8027:** Reclassifies land in Pandacan from Industrial II to Commercial I, requiring non-conforming businesses (specifically, the oil companies' Pandacan Terminals) to cease operations within six months. This case concerns the Mayor's ministerial duty to enforce the ordinance.

*   **Obligation to Relocate:** The oil companies are effectively obligated to relocate their Pandacan Terminals within a reasonable time frame, as monitored by the RTC. The companies must submit a comprehensive relocation plan within 90 days to the RTC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Liabilities:** The oil companies face significant relocation costs if Ordinance No. 8027 is enforced.
*   **Operational Disruptions:** Relocation poses risk to the oil companies' supply chain, as they must ensure a continuous and adequate supply of petroleum products.
*   **Safety Risks:**  Continued operation of the terminals in their present location poses an ongoing safety risk to the densely populated surrounding area due to potential terrorist attacks or accidents. The court found a defective tanker exploded in a street a short distance from an exit gate of the terminals causing death, extensive damage, and conflagration.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC):** Mandates local government executives to enforce all laws and ordinances (Section 455(b)(2)). This is the basis for the mandamus action.

*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7638 (DOE Act of 1992):** Establishes the Department of Energy (DOE) and empowers it to oversee the energy sector.

*   **RA 8479 (Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Law of 1998):** Intended to deregulate the oil industry, but also emphasizes continuous supply. The court decided there was no stripping of power and can be balanced with powers granted to local governments.

*   **Police Power:** The City of Manila's authority to enact Ordinance No. 8027 is based on its delegated police power, exercised through the Sangguniang Panlungsod. The exercise of police power requires a lawful subject and lawful method. It is presumed valid, and the enactment of a zoning ordinance is within the power of the Sangguniang Panlungsod.

*   **Eminent Domain vs Police Power:** A regulation through police power has no compensable taking. Eminent domain requires property to be used for public purposes whereas property condemned under the police power is noxious or intended for a noxious or forbidden purpose and, consequently, is not compensable

*   **Implied Repeal Doctrine:** Applied to determine if Ordinance No. 8119 repealed Ordinance No. 8027.  Implied repeals are disfavored.

*   **Generalia specialibus non derogant (a general law does not nullify a specific or special law):** Applied to the law.

*   **Hospicio de San Jose de Barili, Cebu City v. Department of Agrarian Reform:** Cited by the court to explain that a general repealing clause in a statute does not repeal prior inconsistent laws on the subject matter, including special enactment if there is clear intent to preserve it.

*   **Separation of Powers:** The oil companies argued that the writ does not apply because of the separation of powers, but the court decided against this decision.

*  **Tan v. Pereña, Batangas CATV, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, Lina, Jr. v. Paño, Magtajas v. Pryce Properties Corp., Inc.:** Used as case law and references to decisions where the police power measure of the LGU clashed with national laws

*   **RA 7924:** Cited to claim zoning ordinances are required to be submitted to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for review

*  **EO 72:** Cited to claim that the zoning ordinances of cities and municipalities of Metro Manila are subject to review by the HLURB to ensure compliance with national standards and guidelines

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Implied Repeal:** Whether Ordinance No. 8119 ("Manila Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance of 2006") impliedly repealed Ordinance No. 8027. The court held that it did not, finding no clear intent to repeal and that the ordinances could be reconciled.

*   **Conflict with National Energy Policy:** Whether Ordinance No. 8027 contravenes RA 7638 and RA 8479 by undermining the DOE's authority over energy resources and ensuring a continuous supply of petroleum products. The court ruled there was no contradiction and that the principle of local autonomy had precedence

*   **Validity of Injunctions:**  The court determined that the preliminary injunctions issued by the RTC against the enforcement of Ordinance No. 8027 were invalid, as the oil companies failed to demonstrate a strong enough case of unconstitutionality to overcome the ordinance's presumption of validity.

**Key Holding & Orders:**

1.  Motions for intervention by the oil companies and the DOE were GRANTED, despite late filing, in the interest of justice due to novel arguments raised.
2.  Motions for reconsideration of the prior decision were DENIED.
3.  The RTC was ORDERED to DISMISS the consolidated cases challenging Ordinance No. 8027.
4.  The Mayor of Manila was ORDERED to enforce Ordinance No. 8027.
5.  The oil companies must submit a comprehensive relocation plan to the RTC within 90 days.

**Potential Strategies for Oil Companies:**

*   **Challenge the reasonableness of the relocation plan:**  Argue that the 90-day deadline is insufficient or the plan impractical.
*   **Lobby for amendments to Ordinance 8119:** Seek to rezone the area to allow continued industrial use.
*   **Mitigate disruption of operations:**  Implement strategies to maintain fuel supply during the relocation process.

**Atty. Samson Alcantara was given a warning:** The court was insulted by the counsel, and ordered him to explain within five days from the notice why he should not be disciplined for his refusal, or inability, to file a memorandum worthy of the consideration of this Court, and to pay a Treble cost.
