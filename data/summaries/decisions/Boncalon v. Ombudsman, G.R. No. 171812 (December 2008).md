## Legal Document Summary: Boncalon v. Ombudsman

**Case:** *Remia F. Boncalon v. Ombudsman (Visayas) and COA-City Auditor's Office of Bago City, Negros Occidental*, G.R. No. 171812, December 24, 2008 (595 Phil. 1035)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Court of Appeals decision upholding the Ombudsman's finding of guilt for Dishonesty and imposing dismissal from service and perpetual disqualification to hold public office.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Dishonesty:** Boncalon, a Cashier IV, was found to have a cash shortage of P1,023,829.56 and made a false entry in her cashbook regarding a P1,019,535.21 deposit. This constitutes "dishonesty" under Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules of the Civil Service Commission.
*   **False Entry:** The Court found that the explanation that the money was overlooked was not credible, and this supported a finding that she made or allowed a false entry in her cashbook that made it appear the money was in the bank, when it was not.
*   **Due Process:** Petitioner was given sufficient opportunity to explain, satisfying due process requirements for administrative proceedings despite the late notification of the shortage. (Citing *Casimiro v. Tandog*)
*   **Responsibility:** As the Cashier IV, Boncalon was ultimately responsible for the entries in her cashbook, even if duties were delegated to subordinates, per the Cash Examination Manual.
*   **Materiality of Damage:** Lack of pecuniary damage to the government does not negate administrative liability for dishonesty. Failure to deposit funds timely violates COA Circular No. 91-368 and constitutes gross negligence and/or dishonesty.
*   **Ombudsman's Authority:** The Ombudsman has the power to directly impose administrative penalties, including dismissal, per Section 13(3), Article XI of the 1987 Constitution, and Section 15(3) and Section 21 of RA 6770. (Citing *Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Effect of dismissal:** According to Section 9, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, the penalty of dismissal leads to cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and the disqualification for reemployment in the government service.

**Obligations:**

*   Boncalon had an obligation to deposit collections intact and on time, as a cash accountable officer per COA Circular No. 91-368.
*   She had an obligation to ensure the accuracy of her cashbook, taking personal and direct responsibility of entries, even if delegated to subordinates

**Liabilities:**

*   Boncalon is administratively liable for dishonesty.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Loss:** Forfeiture of retirement benefits and leave credits.
*   **Career Implications:** Perpetual disqualification from holding public office.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The decision indicates this administrative liability is "without prejudice to criminal or civil liability," which could lead to potential criminal charges (e.g., malversation) related to the handling of public funds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article XI, Section 13(3):** Powers of the Ombudsman.
*   **RA 6770, Sections 15(3) & 21:** Functional and Structural Organization of the Office of the Ombudsman.

**Conclusion:**

The ruling reinforces the strict standards of accountability for public officials handling public funds and clarifies the Ombudsman's power to directly impose administrative penalties.
