## Legal Document Summary - *Nieto A. Racho v. Hon. Primo C. Miro, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 168578-79

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus under Rule 65 challenging the Ombudsman's Joint Order denying reconsideration of its Reinvestigation Report (OMB-V-C-02-0240-E) and Resolution (OMB-C-C-03-0729-L) finding probable cause to charge Racho with falsification of public document (SALN).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 171(4), Revised Penal Code:**  Racho is accused of violating this article by making untruthful statements in his Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Networth (SALN).
*   **RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) & RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** The Information cites failure to disclose important facts as specifically mandated under these acts, referencing Section 8 of RA 6713 and Section 7 of RA 3019.  This suggests a violation of disclosure requirements.
*   **SALN Obligation:** Public officials have a legal obligation to truthfully disclose assets, liabilities, and business interests in their SALN.
*   **Ombudsman's Powers (RA 6770):**  The Ombudsman has broad investigatory and prosecutory powers to investigate offenses committed by public officers and is generally free from judicial intervention unless grave abuse of discretion is demonstrated.

**Alleged Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for falsification of public document under Article 171(4) of the Revised Penal Code, stemming from underreporting cash in bank in his SALN.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Criminal prosecution and conviction for falsification.
*   Impact on Racho's employment with the BIR.

**Key Issues & Contentions:**

1.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion (GAD):** Racho argues that Ombudsman Director Palanca-Santiago committed GAD by failing to inhibit herself from the reinvestigation, claiming bias due to her prior involvement and adverse findings during the initial investigation.  He alleges denial of due process.
2.  **Due Process Violation:** Racho claims denial of due process because he insists on the dismissal of his cases before the OMB.
3.  **Probable Cause:** Racho challenges the existence of probable cause for falsification, arguing that the evidence (photocopied bank certifications) is insufficient.
4.  **Lack of Hearing:** Racho complains that no hearing was conducted on his motion for reinvestigation, implying a denial of opportunity to be heard.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Supreme Court found no GAD on the part of the respondents. The finding of probable cause was supported by substantial evidence: the significant discrepancy between Racho's declared cash in bank and his actual bank deposits.  One adverse ruling is insufficient to prove bias.
*   **No Denial of Due Process:** The Court ruled that a clarificatory hearing is not mandatory during reinvestigation (citing *De Ocampo v. Secretary of Justice*).  Racho was given ample opportunity to present his side (filing comments and motions for extension), thus substantially satisfying due process requirements.
*   **Probable Cause Determination Upheld:** The Court emphasized that probable cause need not be based on clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Failure to Comply with Procedural Rules:** The Court noted that the petitioner failed to attach a certified true copy of the assailed Resolution in OMB-C-C-03-0729-L in disregard of paragraph 2 of Section 1, Rule 65 on certiorari.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 171(4) of the Revised Penal Code:** Falsification of public documents.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):** Outlines the powers and functions of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   **Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Establishes ethical standards for public officials.
*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Prohibits corrupt practices among public officers.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Procedure for certiorari and mandamus petitions.
*   **De Ocampo v. Secretary of Justice:** Jurisprudence on the non-mandatory nature of clarificatory hearings during preliminary investigation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on the Joint Affidavit submitted by petitioner with his brothers and nephew. The affidavit could be seen as ambiguous and contentious as the OMB did not give weight to it, stating that the brothers and nephew had not declared any interest in any of the corporation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause and dismissed Racho's petition.  The RTC was ordered to proceed with the criminal trial. The Court emphasized the broad discretion of the Ombudsman in investigating public officials and the importance of complying with procedural rules in filing petitions for certiorari.
