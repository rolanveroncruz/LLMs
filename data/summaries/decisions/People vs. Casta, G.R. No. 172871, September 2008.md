## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Casta*, G.R. No. 172871

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellant Clemente Casta was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder for the stabbing death of Danilo Camba. The RTC decision and CA affirmation were initially appealed to the Supreme Court, which endorsed it to the CA for final disposition.
*   **Admission:** Casta admitted to the stabbing, raising self-defense. This admission weakens his case and requires him to convincingly prove self-defense.
*   **Self-Defense:** The Court rejected the self-defense claim due to lack of credible evidence of unlawful aggression by the victim. The testimony of eyewitnesses contradicted Casta's claims. *Case law: People v. Santillana establishes the burden shifting when self-defense is invoked.* *Art. 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code* sets the requirements.
*   **Treachery:** The killing was qualified by treachery. The sudden and unexpected nature of the attack from behind, targeting vital organs (heart, lungs), deprived the victim of any opportunity for self-defense. *Case law: People v. Batin* defines treachery elements.
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The Court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender because the accused surrendered to authorities a day after the incident, showing intent to unconditionally surrender, either because he acknowledges his guilt or wishes to save the authorities the trouble and expense attendant to the efforts of searching for and capturing him. *Case law: Ladiana v. People* sets the requirements.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve his sentence, as modified by the SC.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay civil indemnity to the heirs of the deceased.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Guilty of Murder.
*   Civil Liability:
    *   Death indemnity: P50,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.00
    *   Temperate Damages: P25,000.00

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ex Post Facto Concerns:** The crime occurred before the amendment of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code by Republic Act No. 7659, which increased the penalty for murder. The Court correctly applies the pre-amendment penalty to avoid violating the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws (Section 22, Article III, 1987 Constitution).
*   **Lack of Documentary Evidence:** While the court acknowledges the loss of receipts for funeral expenses, *People v. Abrazaldo* and *People v. Villanueva* allow for the award of temperate damages even without receipts.
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:**  The Court denies the claim for loss of earning capacity due to the lack of documentary evidence.  Exception to the rule don't apply because victim wasn't earning less than the minimum wage *Case law People v. Ballesteros*.
