## Legal Document Summary: BSP vs. Banco Filipino

**Cases:** G.R. No. 178696 (BSP vs. Banco Filipino) and G.R. No. 192607 (Banco Filipino vs. Central Bank Board of Liquidators) (Consolidated)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing conflicting Court of Appeals decisions regarding a Petition for Revival of Judgment filed by Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank (BFSMB) against the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and its Monetary Board (MB), and the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators (CB-BOL).

**Background:**

*   1985: Central Bank (CB) closed BFSMB.
*   1991: Supreme Court (SC) in *Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. The Monetary Board*, 281 Phil. 842 (1991) (G.R. No. 70054) ordered CB-MB to reorganize BFSMB and allow it to resume business under CB-MB comptrollership.
*   1993: RA 7653 (The New Central Bank Act) abolished the CB and established BSP. CB continued as CB-BOL for liquidation purposes.
*   1994: BFSMB reopened under BSP comptrollership.
*   1999: Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between BSP and BFSMB for dacion en pago of BFSMB properties to settle "advances" from CB. BSP lifted comptrollership in 2000.
*   2004: BFSMB filed Petition for Revival of Judgment in G.R. No. 70054, seeking full compliance, including restoration of pre-closure branch network and preferential financial assistance.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Revival of Judgment (Rule 39, Sec. 6, Rules of Court; Art. 1144, 1152, Civil Code):** The central issue is whether BFSMB's petition to revive the 1991 SC judgment in G.R. No. 70054 was filed within the prescriptive period. The Court ruled that the petition for revival of judgement was filed more than 12 years from February 4, 1992 (date of finality of the judgement being revived), rendering it time-barred. The court rejected BFSMB's argument that RA 7653 tolled the prescription period because it made enforcement uncertain. The Court stated that the CB-BOL and BSP are readily identifiable, making it unjustifiable to file the action beyond the 10-year period to revive the judgement.
*   **Extinguishment of Obligation:** The Supreme Court found that the obligation under G.R. No. 70054 had been fulfilled. The reorganization and reopening of BFSMB under BSP comptrollership constituted performance. The court also cited the preambular clause of the MOA in 1999 as evidence that BSP had complied with the judgement.
*   **Successor-in-Interest:** Whether the BSP is the successor-in-interest of the defunct CB with respect to the liabilities arising from G.R. No. 70054. The Supreme Court avoided direct ruling citing potential prejudice to existing Civil cases. However, previous jurisprudence in *Central Bank-Board of Liquidators v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank* G.R. No. 173399, established that CB and BSP have different personalities.
*   **Scope of the Judgment:** The Court held that the additional reliefs sought by BFSMB in the Revival Petition (e.g., restoration of branches, preferential financial assistance) exceeded the scope of the original 1991 SC judgment.
*   **Discretion of BSP:** The Court recognized the BSP's statutory discretion to determine conditions for a bank's resumption of business as stated under Secs. 1, 2 and 3 of RA 7653. The Supreme Court stressed that RTC and CA cannot fetter the discretion of the BSP regarding the conditions imposed on the reorganization of BFSMB.
*   **Mootness:** Discussion of other procedural issues (forum shopping, authority of signatories, lack of cause of action) rendered moot due to the findings on prescription and performance.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 39, Sec. 6, Rules of Court
*   Art. 1144 & 1152, Civil Code
*   RA 7653 (New Central Bank Act), Secs 1, 2, 3, 132(e)
*   RA 265 (The Central Bank Act), Section 29
*   *Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. The Monetary Board*, 281 Phil. 842 (1991) (G.R. No. 70054)
*   *Central Bank-Board of Liquidators v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank*, G.R. No. 173399

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of the "reorganization" required by the 1991 SC decision was a point of contention, with BFSMB arguing for extensive financial and operational support.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court found the Central Bank (now BSP) obligations of the 1991 ruling has been met.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This decision reinforces the independence and discretion afforded to the BSP in regulating the banking sector.
*   The failure of BFSMB to secure a favorable ruling on the revival petition could impact its financial stability.
*   The unresolved issue of the status of BSP-MB and CB-BOL as successors-in-interest may affect the outcome of pending civil cases for damages.

**Outcome:**

*   G.R. No. 178696 (BSP victory): CA Decision reversed.
*   G.R. No. 192607 (Banco Filipino loss): CA Decision affirmed.
*   BFSMB's Petition for Revival of Judgment is DISMISSED.
*   The Supreme Court noted improper procedure of not consolidating the appellate court cases initially.
