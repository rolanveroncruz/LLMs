## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Rodolfo Cruz and Lota Santos-Cruz vs. Heirs of Alejandro So Hiong* (G.R. No. 228641)

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's ruling, upholding the title of Spouses Cruz to a parcel of land. The Court ruled that the Heirs of Alejandro So Hiong failed to prove their claim for reconveyance based on alleged fraud in the transfer of title. The Court cited the legal presumption of regularity in the issuance of TCT No. 356877-R in favor of the Spouses Cruz and faulted the Heirs for failing to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud. The Court also noted the long delay (34 years) in asserting the claim and actions inconsistent with ownership.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Claim for Reconveyance:** Heirs of Alejandro So Hiong (substituted by his heirs) sought annulment of TCT No. 356877-R and reconveyance of land, alleging a fraudulent sale.
*   **Defense of Spouses Cruz:** Spouses Cruz claimed valid purchase of the land and asserted prescription and laches as defenses.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Heirs of Alejandro So Hiong:** Failed to prove their allegation of fraud. Risk of losing any future legal claim to the property.
*   **Spouses Cruz:** Risk of losing title if Heirs had been able to prove fraud or procedural irregularity in obtaining title.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Heirs of Datu Dalandag Kuli v. Pia, et al., 760 Phil. 883 (2015):** Cited as precedent, establishes that the inability to produce a Deed of Conveyance does not automatically invalidate a title, especially when the Register of Deeds' records indicate a valid transfer. This is used to overcome the CA's reliance on the lack of a deed of sale.
*   **Section 57 of the Property Registration Decree:** Procedure in Registration of Conveyances.
*   **Heirs of Teodora Loyola v. Court of Appeals, 803 Phil. 143, 161 (2017):** Sets burden of proof for claims involving allegations of fraud in obtaining title.
*   **Heirs of Velasquez v. Court of Appeals, 382 Phil. 438, 458 (2000):** Legal presumption of regularity of the performance by government offices of their official duties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Deed of Sale:** The absence of the deed of sale was a central point of contention. The CA viewed it as undermining the Spouses Cruz's claim, while the Supreme Court ruled the absence did not invalidate the sale, given the circumstances and the legal presumption of regularity.

**Legal Analysis:**

The case hinges on the principle of *indefeasibility of title*, balanced against the requirement of proving fraud with clear and convincing evidence in actions for reconveyance. The Supreme Court emphasized the legal presumption of regularity in the issuance of titles and placed the burden of proof squarely on the Heirs of Alejandro So Hiong to demonstrate fraud. The Heirs' failure to provide more than a bare allegation of fraud, coupled with their delay in asserting the claim and actions inconsistent with ownership, led to the dismissal of their claim.
