## Legal Document Summary - *Sison v. Morales-Malaca*, 571 Phil. 566 (2008)

**Case:** *Atty. Emmanuel R. Sison, Antonio Fernando, and Dr. Arellano T. So v. Dr. Evangeline P. Morales-Malaca*, G.R. No. 169931, March 12, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which modified the Civil Service Commission's (CSC) resolution finding Sison, Fernando, and So guilty of simple misconduct and discourtesy.

**Facts:** This case arises from a complaint filed by Dr. Morales-Malaca against Sison (Secretary to the Mayor), Fernando (City Administrator), and So regarding her reassignment and subsequent handling of her former office. The CSC dismissed the complaint. The CA modified, finding the respondents guilty of simple misconduct and discourtesy in the course of official duties, penalizing them with a fine and reprimand.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Sison:** The Supreme Court found that the Special Order designating Dr. Zaide as OIC of the Assistant Hospital Director was a valid exercise of discretion. There was no evidence Sison participated in the *implementation* of the order. Therefore, the Court reversed the CA's finding of misconduct.
*   **Fernando:** The Supreme Court found that the Memorandum for the forcible opening of Malaca’s former office was within Fernando’s powers as City Administrator under Section 480, Article X of R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code). The failure to serve Malaca a copy of the Memorandum, while negligent, did not necessarily translate to *willful* misconduct. However, the Court admonished Fernando to be more circumspect in the exercise of his duties.
*   **So:** The Supreme Court agreed with the CA regarding discourtesy. So's behavior in implementing Fernando's order (shouting at Malaca, denying her husband access, changing locks) demonstrated a lack of courtesy and civility. The Court cited Rule XIV, Section 23 of the Civil Service Law and Rules and reprimanded So.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Public officials are obligated to observe courtesy, civility, and self-restraint in their dealings with others. Failure to do so constitutes discourtesy.
*   Actions taken must be within the bounds of authority granted by law (RA 7160) and must be implemented with consideration for the rights of affected parties.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Actions, even if within the scope of authority, can lead to administrative liability if implemented without due regard for the rights and dignity of others.
*   Failure to furnish copies of relevant orders to affected parties can lead to scrutiny and potential liability, though not automatically to misconduct.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code), Section 480, Article X:** Defines the powers and functions of the City Administrator.
*   **Rule XIV, Section 23 of the Civil Service Law and Rules:** Governs discourtesy as a light offense.
*   **Civil Service Commission v. Ledesma, G.R. No. 154521, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 589, 603:** Defines misconduct.
*   **Camus v. Civil Service Board of Appeals, No. L-13685, 31 May 1961, 2 SCRA 370, 375:** Defines misconduct
*   **Perez v. Cunting, 436 Phil. 618, 625 (2002):** Explains obligation of public officials to observe courtesy.
*   **Alcuizar v. Carpio, A.M.-RTJ-07-2068, 7 August 2007, 529 SCRA 216, 229:** Defines misconduct.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Degree of Failure to Serve Notice:** The line between mere negligence and *willful* misconduct related to the failure to serve Malaca a copy of the memorandum. The court emphasized that the misconduct must be willful in character.
*   **Scope of Authority vs. Manner of Implementation:** While actions may fall within the scope of one's authority (e.g., Fernando’s memo), the *manner* of implementation can create liability (e.g., So's discourteous behavior).

**Summary of Decision:** The Supreme Court partially granted the petition. It dismissed the charge of misconduct against Sison and Fernando but admonished Fernando to be more circumspect in his official duties. The Court reprimanded So for discourtesy.
