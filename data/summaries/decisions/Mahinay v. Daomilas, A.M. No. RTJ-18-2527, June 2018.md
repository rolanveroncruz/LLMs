## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-18-2527

**Case:** Atty. Makilito B. Mahinay v. Hon. Ramon B. Daomilas, Jr., and Atty. Rosadey E. Faelnar-Binongo

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a judge (Daomilas, Jr.) and clerk of court (Faelnar-Binongo) for gross inexcusable negligence, gross ignorance of the law, malfeasance, inefficiency and collusion related to SRC Case No. SRC-223-CEB (intra-corporate controversy).

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Atty. Mahinay's Complaint:** Alleged that Judge Daomilas delayed acting on a prayer for a TRO/Writ of Preliminary Injunction for over two years, violating the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies. Also challenged the Judgeâ€™s Order allowing the defendant to file counter-bond. Also alleged Clerk of Court Binongo colluded with the judge in delaying the issuance of the writ and improperly allowed the filing of a prohibited motion.
*   **Judge Daomilas' Defense:** Denied delay, citing heavy caseload due to concurrent assignments, understaffed branch, and justification of the counter-bond under Rule 58 of the Rules of Court. Explained that the Motion for Reconsideration was set for hearing early because the posting of a counter-bond was a 'good cause'. Asserted the intent to withdraw the same to give way to the petition for mandamus and certiorari that they filed before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Clerk of Court Faelnar-Binongo's Defense:** Denied collusion, stating ministerial duty to receive pleadings, no discretion to determine if a pleading is prohibited. Asserted that the rules allow a shorter period of giving notice of hearing to the parties "for a good cause".
*   **OCA Findings:** Recommended Judge Daomilas be found guilty of Undue Delay in Rendering an Order, but mitigated the penalty due to heavy caseload. Recommended dismissal of charges against Clerk of Court Faelnar-Binongo.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Judge Daomilas:** Found **GUILTY** of **Undue Delay in Rendering an Order**, a less serious charge under Section 9 (1), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.  The Court noted violation of the constitutional mandate (Art. 8, Sec. 15) requiring decisions within 90 days. Mitigating circumstances considered: heavy caseload and the first administrative offense. **Penalty:** FINE of P5,000.00, with stern warning.
*   **Atty. Faelnar-Binongo:** Administrative charges **DISMISSED** for lack of merit. The Court found that as a clerk of court, she had no discretion to refuse to receive pleadings and motions even if they are contrary to or prohibited by law.

**Statutory/Rule References:**

*   **Article 8, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution:** Mandates time limits for resolving cases/matters by courts.
*   **Rule 58 of the Rules of Court:** Pertains to Preliminary Injunctions.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, Section 9(1):** Classifies Undue Delay in Rendering an Order as a less serious charge.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies:** Governs procedure for intra-corporate cases.
*   **Rule 15, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Provides for motions be set for hearing.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Daomilas:** Subject to a P5,000 fine and a stern warning against future delays.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The decision highlights the need for judges to manage caseloads effectively to avoid delays.
*   While the OCA and the Court mitigated the Judge's penalty due to heavy caseload, the ruling underscores the Judge's Court management responsibilities
*   The document doesn't explicitly state whether the TRO/Writ of Preliminary Injunction was ultimately granted, or the status of the underlying SRC Case No. SRC-223-CEB. The document indicates that the motion to recall and/or expunge was withdrawn by the petitioners due to their intent to file a petition for mandamus and certiorari before the Court of Appeals.

**Key Takeaways:**

The case emphasizes the importance of timely resolution of cases and the potential administrative liability of judges for undue delay. Mitigating factors such as heavy caseload may be considered, but are unlikely to excuse consistent failures to meet constitutional deadlines.
