## Legal Document Summary: *Gacho v. Fuentes, Jr.* (A.M. No. P-98-1265)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Dioscoro A. Fuentes, Jr., Deputy Sheriff IV, for Grave Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Severiana Gacho alleged Fuentes fraudulently demanded 10% (P170,000) of the winning bid (P1,700,000) in a public auction as "sheriff's fee" without issuing a receipt.  The official sheriff's fee was only P34,080.
*   **Excess Collection:** Fuentes admitted collecting P170,000 but claimed the excess (P135,920) was intended for capital gains tax, documentary stamps, and registration fees (not sheriff fees).  He later returned the excess to Gacho.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Gacho filed an affidavit of desistance after receiving the refund, but the Court proceeded with the administrative case due to public interest.
*   **Lack of Receipt:** Fuentes failed to issue an official or provisional receipt for the P170,000 received.
*   **Unremitted Funds:**  He also did not remit the sheriff's fees promptly nor the alleged amounts for taxes and registration fees.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Fuentes, as a Deputy Sheriff, had a duty to collect only the lawful sheriff's fees (Rule 141, Rules of Court).
*   He was obligated to issue official receipts for all amounts collected in his official capacity (General Auditing and Accounting Rules).
*   He was obligated to uphold the integrity of public service (Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution; Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** While Gacho withdrew her complaint, the Court correctly noted that administrative cases involving public trust cannot be dismissed based solely on the complainant's change of heart (*Flores v. Caniya*).
*   **Justification for Excess:** Fuentes' claim that the excess amount was for taxes and registration fees lacks credibility as he didn't explain this to Gacho initially.
*   **Misrepresentation:** The Court found that the sheriff misrepresented the amount to be charged and failed to issue receipts.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Rules of Court:** Governs lawful sheriff's fees.
*   **Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution:** Public office is a public trust.
*   **Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees:** Requires public officers to serve with integrity and professionalism.
*   **General Auditing and Accounting Rules:** Mandates the issuance of receipts.
*   ***Flores v. Caniya*, 256 SCRA 518:** Underscores the high standards of conduct expected of court personnel.
*   ***Tan v. Herras*, 195 SCRA 1:** Prohibits sheriffs from receiving gratuities.
*   ***Añonuevo v. Pempeña*, 234 SCRA 168:**  Condemns demanding excessive fees.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**  There aren't specifically ambiguous clauses. The contentious point revolves around Fuentes' explanation for the excess collection, which was found to be unconvincing and a misrepresentation.

**Conclusion:**

The Court found Fuentes liable for grave dishonesty and grave misconduct and ordered his dismissal from service with forfeiture of benefits and prejudice to reemployment. His actions violated ethical and legal obligations, eroded public trust, and justified the severe penalty despite the complainant's initial affidavit of desistance.
