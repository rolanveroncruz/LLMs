**Legal Document Summary: Bides-Ulaso vs. Atty. Noe-Lacsamana (A.C. No. 7297)**

**Case Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Atty. Edita Noe-Lacsamana, filed by Imelda Bides-Ulaso, seeking her disbarment. The central issue is Atty. Noe-Lacsamana's notarization of an amended verification and affidavit of non-forum shopping for her client, Irene Bides, *before* Bides signed it.  The IBP initially recommended a 6-month suspension, but the Supreme Court ultimately reprimanded her.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Notarization Irregularity:** The core problem is that Atty. Noe-Lacsamana notarized a document before the affiant (Irene Bides) had signed it, violating Notarial Law. The jurat falsely indicated Bides's presence and oath-taking.
*   **Defense Arguments:** Atty. Noe-Lacsamana claimed it was a "sample draft" for her secretary and that the correct version was filed later. She denies any intent to deceive the court and argues that the complainant withdrew the complaint in lower courts.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** A compromise agreement in the underlying civil case included a stipulation that the disbarment case should be dropped. However, the Supreme Court correctly reiterated it has separate jurisdiction for the disbarment proceedings.
*   **Statute of Limitations:**  Atty. Noe-Lacsamana unsuccessfully argued that the complaint was time-barred. Disbarment proceedings are *sui generis* and not subject to ordinary statutes of limitation (citing *Calo, Jr. v. Degamo*).
*   **Lack of Bad Faith:** While acknowledging the violation of Notarial Law, the Supreme Court found no *malice* or deliberate intent to deceive on Atty. Noe-Lacsamana's part. The inclusion of "for" before the signature was seen as mitigating.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Noe-Lacsamana violated her duty as a notary to ensure the affiant's physical presence and oath-taking (citing *Lopena v. Cabatos*).
*   She also breached her duty as a lawyer to uphold the laws of the land and promote respect for legal processes (Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility).
*   Her actions were deemed gross negligence and a violation of the Notarial Law.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Pre-Notarization Practice:** The case highlights the dangers of pre-notarization, a practice that can expose lawyers to disciplinary action.
*   **Secretary's Negligence:**  While Atty. Noe-Lacsamana attempted to attribute the error to her secretary, lawyers remain responsible for their staff and the integrity of their work product (*Tan v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Notarial Register:** The Investigating Commissioner raised concerns about the notarial register, implying potential discrepancies (missing document number), however this was not pursued by the Supreme Court.
*   **Sanction** Although the final sanction was a reprimand due to mitigating circumstances, the case serves as a strong warning against similar conduct.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Calo, Jr. v. Degamo (A.C. No. 516):** No Statute of Limitations for disbarment cases.
*   **Lopena v. Cabatos (A.C. No. 3441):** Affiant must be physically present for notarization.
*   **Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Lawyer's duty to uphold the law.
*   **Tan v. Court of Appeals (295 SCRA 765):** Lawyer is responsible for their staff's negligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The IBP found an "unacceptable pattern of behavior" regarding similar errors by Atty. Noe-Lacsamana. However, the Supreme Court did not elaborate on this, focusing on the specific incident. This could be used in future disciplinary proceedings if similar instances arise.

**Conclusion:**

The case is a cautionary tale about the importance of strict adherence to notarial protocols. While Atty. Noe-Lacsamana avoided suspension due to mitigating factors, the reprimand and warning underscore the potential consequences of negligent notarization practices.
