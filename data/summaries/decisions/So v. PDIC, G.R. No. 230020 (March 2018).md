**Case Summary: *Peter L. So v. Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC)*, G.R. No. 230020, March 19, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari challenging PDIC's denial of a deposit insurance claim.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Petitioner Peter L. So opened a Special Incentive Savings Account (SISA) with Cooperative Rural Bank Bulacan (CRBB), which was later placed under PDIC receivership.
*   PDIC denied So's deposit insurance claim based on the finding that the account originated from a terminated SISA jointly owned by the Reyes family, constituting a prohibited "splitting of deposits."
*   So filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 with the RTC, which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

**Issue:** Does the RTC have jurisdiction over a petition for certiorari filed under Rule 65, assailing the PDIC's denial of a deposit insurance claim?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the RTC lacks jurisdiction. The proper venue for a Petition for Certiorari challenging PDIC's denial of a deposit insurance claim is the **Court of Appeals (CA)**.

**Reasoning & Legal Basis:**

*   **PDIC as Quasi-Judicial Agency:** The Court found that PDIC acts as a quasi-judicial agency when determining the validity of deposit insurance claims. *Lintang Bedol v. COMELEC* and *Carlito C. Encinas v. Agustin* are cited to define quasi-judicial power as the authority to adjudicate rights and obligations, involving fact-finding, weighing evidence, and exercising discretion, which the PDIC possesses.
*   **Rule 65, Section 4, Rules of Court:** The Court cited Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, which specifies that petitions involving acts or omissions of quasi-judicial agencies are cognizable *only* by the CA, unless otherwise provided.
*   **PDIC Charter (RA 3591, as amended by RA 10846):**
    *   Section 4(f) states PDIC actions are final and executory, reviewable only by Certiorari.
    *   Section 22 prohibits any court other than the CA from issuing restraining orders or injunctions against PDIC actions.
    *   Section 5(g) confirms CA jurisdiction for Certiorari petitions challenging PDIC actions taken in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   PDIC has the duty to determine the validity of deposit insurance claims and grant or deny them per its charter.
*   Depositors aggrieved by PDIC's denial of claims must file a Petition for Certiorari with the CA within 30 days of notice of denial.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Splitting of Deposits:** The determination of what constitutes "splitting of deposits" and the evidentiary burden PDIC bears in proving such splitting could be a point of contention in future cases.  Specifically, the degree of evidence required to link accounts and establish intent to circumvent insurance limits.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion Standard:** The standard for overturning PDIC decisions is "grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction."  This is a high bar and difficult to prove, limiting the likelihood of successful challenges.
*   **Time Limit:** Strict adherence to the 30-day deadline for filing the Petition for Certiorari with the CA is crucial, as failure to meet this deadline will result in dismissal.
