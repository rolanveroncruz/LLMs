## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. BPI, G.R. No. 224327

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc decision in CTA EB No. 1173 (CTA CASE No. 8350), regarding CIR's tax assessment against BPI (as successor to Citytrust Banking Corporation - CBC) for deficiency income tax for the taxable year 1986.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Deficiency Tax Assessment:** CIR assessed CBC for deficiency income tax for 1986. The core issue is the timeliness of the assessment and subsequent collection efforts against BPI as the surviving corporation after the merger with CBC.

*   **Statute of Limitations:** The primary defense revolves around the statute of limitations for tax assessment under the NIRC. The 3-year period for assessment is at issue, commencing from the filing of the income tax return on April 15, 1987.

*   **Waivers of Statute of Limitations:** CBC executed waivers of the statute of limitations. The validity of these waivers is crucial. The CTA found the waivers non-compliant with RMO No. 20-90 (proper form for valid waivers), rendering them ineffective in extending the assessment period. *This is a critical point.*

*   **Compromise Settlement Attempts:** CBC attempted to negotiate a compromise settlement, but no final agreement was reached. Offers and counter-offers were made, but the CIR ultimately disapproved the compromise.

*   **Issuance of Assessment Notice:** The CTA ruled that the CIR failed to prove that a final decision on the disputed assessment was received by BPI. The Assessment Notices, dated May 6, 1991, were deemed issued beyond the 3-year assessment period. The CTA held that the February 5, 1992 letter was not proven to have been received by BPI.

*   **Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy:**  CIR issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy in 2011, prompting BPI to file a Petition for Review with the CTA. This is the immediate cause of action.

*   **CTA Jurisdiction:** CIR argued the CTA lacked jurisdiction because BPI failed to timely contest the assessments. The CTA held it has jurisdiction over cases involving the cancellation of warrants of distraint and/or levy under Section 7 of RA 9282.

**Obligations:**

*   **CIR's Obligation:** To properly assess and collect taxes within the statutory period and to comply with the required procedures for waivers.
*   **Taxpayer's Obligation:** To timely file returns and pay taxes due.

**Liabilities:**

*   The potential liability rests on BPI to pay the assessed deficiency income tax, plus penalties and interest. However, the CTA and Supreme Court found that the assessment was time-barred and therefore BPI is not liable.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Invalid Waivers:** The invalid waivers of the statute of limitations pose a significant risk to the CIR's case. Failure to strictly comply with RMO No. 20-90 is fatal. See *CIR v. Kudos Metal Corporation* for precedent on strict compliance.
*   **Prescription:**  The core risk is prescription. If the assessment was made beyond the prescriptive period, then the government's right to assess and collect is extinguished.
*   **Proof of Receipt:** Lack of proof of receipt of the February 5, 1992 letter, which the CIR insists to be the final decision, further weakens the CIR's position, relying on *Nava v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*.
*   **Estoppel Argument:** The CIR's argument that BPI is estopped from raising prescription is unlikely to succeed, as the CIR caused the defects in the waivers, relying on *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Kudos Metal Corporation*.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code):** Relevant provisions on assessment and collection of taxes, and the statute of limitations. Specifically Section 229 (Protesting of Assessment)
*   **RA 9282, Section 7:** CTA Jurisdiction
*   **RMO No. 20-90:** Rules on the proper form and execution of waivers of the statute of limitations.
*   **RMO No. 45-93:** Application for Compromise Settlement/Abatement of Penalties
*   **_CIR v. Kudos Metal Corporation_:**  Held that estoppel cannot validate defective waivers when BIR failed to strictly comply with procedural requirements.
*   **_Nava v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue_:** Stresses the importance of proving the release, mailing or sending of assessment notices.
*   **_Coll. Of Int. Rev. vs. Bautista_** an assessment is made when sent within the prescribed period.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the CTA's decision denying the CIR's petition. The key finding rests on the prescription of the right to assess and collect. The failure to comply with the procedural requirements for validly executing waivers of the statute of limitations, coupled with the inability to prove receipt of the assessment notice, proved fatal to the CIR's case. BPI prevails.
