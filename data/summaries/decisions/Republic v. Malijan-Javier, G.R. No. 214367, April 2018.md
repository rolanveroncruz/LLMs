## Legal Document Summary - *Republic v. Malijan-Javier* G.R. No. 214367

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Municipal Circuit Trial Court's (MCTC) adjudication of land (Lot No. 1591, Cad. 729, Talisay Cadastre) in favor of respondents Laureana and Iden Malijan-Javier, based on an application for land registration.

**Key Provision:** Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), requiring "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier."

**Issue:** Whether the MCTC and CA erred in granting the land registration application. The Supreme Court (SC) focused solely on the alienability and disposability requirement.

**Holding:** The SC reversed the CA and MCTC decisions, denying the land registration application.

**Obligations/Requirements (Unfulfilled):**

*   **Proof of Alienability and Disposability:** The critical failure lies in the respondents' inability to present **a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.** This is the *sine qua non* for proving the land's alienable and disposable character.
*Reliance on secondary evidence like CENRO certifications, DENR reports, and survey plan annotations, while demonstrating a *bona fide* attempt, was deemed insufficient.* This strict requirement stems from cases like *Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, 578 Phil. 441 (2008)* and *Republic v. Lualhati, 757 Phil. 119 (2015)* which emphasize the necessity of the DENR Secretary's approved classification. The CENRO certification is issued only to verify the DENR Secretary issuance through a survey.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Loss of Claim:** The respondents lose their claim for land registration.
*   **Potential for Future Litigation:** Without proper registration, the land's status remains uncertain, potentially leading to future disputes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Substantial Compliance:** The CA erred in applying the principle of substantial compliance. The SC emphasized the need for strict adherence to the requirements for land registration, particularly regarding proof of alienability.
*   **Possession Since June 12, 1945:** While the respondents presented evidence of possession by themselves and their predecessors, the SC did not rule on the sufficiency of this evidence as it deemed the alienability issue dispositive. The Republic argued the tax declarations only date back to 1948.
*   **Laches:** It is important to determine why the land owner has waited for so long to apply for land registration.

*   *Republic v. Spouses Go, G.R. No. 197297, August 2, 2017*
*   *Republic v. Hanover Worldwide Trading Corporation, 636 Phil. 739 (2010)*
*   *Victoria v. Republic*

**Potential Arguments for Respondents (Unsuccessful Here):**

*   **Substantial Compliance:** As attempted in this case with secondary evidence.
*   **Long-Standing Possession:** Argument based on tax declarations and witness testimony, though ultimately irrelevant without proof of alienability.

**Conclusion:** The lack of the DENR Secretary's approved classification and certification proved fatal to the respondents' land registration application. The case reinforces the strict requirements for proving the alienable and disposable nature of land sought to be registered under PD 1529. This case is important to be considered for future actions of similar nature.
