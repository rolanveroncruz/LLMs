## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Cornel, G.R. No. 229047

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs).

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court acquitted the accused-appellant, Ramoncito Cornel y Asuncion, due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (illegal sale of 0.03 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) for Php1,000.00).
*   **Defense:** Denial and alleged frame-up.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove an unbroken chain of custody. Specifically,
    *   The marking of the seized item was not done immediately at the place of arrest.
    *   The prosecution's explanation for delay (commotion) was deemed insufficient.
    *   The inventory was conducted at the barangay hall, not the place of arrest.
    *   There was no valid reason given for the absence of representatives from the media and the Department of Justice during the inventory, a requirement under the then-governing Section 21 of R.A. 9165 prior to its amendment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 21:** Requirements for the custody and handling of seized drugs, particularly regarding inventory and photography.  The Court refers to the original provision prior to amendment by R.A. 10640.
*   **R.A. No. 10640:** Amendments to R.A. No. 9165.

**Case Law References:**

*   The decision cites several cases discussing the importance of adhering to Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and the chain of custody rule, including *People v. Ismael*, *People v. Gatlabayan*, *People v. Mirondo*, *People v. Miranda*, *People v. Almorfe*, *People v. De Guzman*, *People v. Sagana*, *People v. Paz*, *People v. Mamangon*, *People v. Jugo*, *People v. Calibod*, *People v. Ching*, *People v. Geronimo*, *People v. Ceralde*, and *People v. Macapundag*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The decision emphasizes that non-compliance with Section 21 does not automatically invalidate the seizure, *provided* there are justifiable grounds and the integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.  However, the Court found the prosecution's offered justifications insufficient in this case.
*   **Applicability of Amendments:** The court made specific note of the fact that the original provision was applicable in this specific instance due to the timing of the case.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including establishing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   Law enforcement officers are obligated to comply strictly with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 to ensure the admissibility of seized evidence. Failure to do so, without justifiable grounds, can result in acquittal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Evidence:** Failure to immediately mark and inventory seized items increases the risk of misidentification or tampering, potentially leading to the inadmissibility of evidence.
*   **Acquittal:** Non-compliance with the procedural requirements of Section 21, especially the presence of required witnesses, creates a significant risk of acquittal, even if there is other evidence of guilt. This is particularly true when justifications for non-compliance are deemed inadequate.
*   **Increased Scrutiny of Police Procedures:** This case highlights the court's willingness to scrutinize police procedures in drug cases, particularly concerning chain of custody and compliance with Section 21.

**Overall Assessment:** The case underscores the importance of meticulous adherence to procedural requirements in drug cases. The acquittal of the accused demonstrates the court's strict interpretation of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its emphasis on ensuring the integrity of evidence. This case serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement, highlighting the need for proper training and rigorous implementation of chain of custody procedures.
