## Legal Document Summary: People v. Libre, G.R. No. 235980

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Leonila and Joseph Libre for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs). The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the conviction, acquitting both accused.

**Key Provisions & Elements of the Offense:**
*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of:
    *   Identity of buyer, seller, object (dangerous drug), and consideration.
    *   Delivery of the drug and payment.
* **Corpus Delicti** : Presentation of drugs in court.

**Chain of Custody and Section 21, RA 9165:**
*   The SC focused on the chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165 (prior to its amendment by RA 10640) and its Implementing Rules.
*   **Critical Requirement:** Immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items **in the presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative, and an elected public official.**  All must sign the inventory.
*   **Saving Clause (Sec. 21 IRR, now statutory due to RA 10640):**  Non-compliance can be excused if:
    *   **Justifiable grounds exist for non-compliance.**
    *   **Integrity and evidentiary value of seized items are preserved.**

**SC Ruling & Key Holdings:**

*   **Meritorious Appeal:** SC found "unexplained and unjustified deviations" from the chain of custody rule.
*   **Missing DOJ Representative:** Failure to secure a DOJ representative during inventory/photography was problematic.  The police's statement that they "exerted efforts" was insufficient.  They had to specify what efforts to make a genuine, earnest effort.
    *   Cited *People v. Umipang* for emphasis that vague attempts to secure representatives is insufficient justification for deviation from procedure.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** Because of the deviation, the SC held that the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti (shabu) was compromised. This resulted in an acquittal.
*   **Benefit to Co-Accused:** Acquittal also extended to Joseph Libre, even though he didn't formally appeal, due to Rule 122, Section 11(a) of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (favorable judgment applies to co-accused). Cited People v. Lumaya.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strict Application of Chain of Custody:** The SC emphasized that the Section 21 procedure is "a matter of substantive law," not merely a procedural technicality.
*   **Burden on Prosecution:** The prosecution has the *positive duty* to prove compliance with Section 21 and to justify any deviations.  Failure to do so results in acquittal, even if the issue wasn't raised below.
*   **Impact of *Miranda*:** Cites *People v. Mamangon* which reiterated the importance of individual rights.
*   **Ambiguity on "Justifiable Grounds":**  The case highlights the need for *specific and detailed* evidence of genuine efforts to secure the required witnesses, particularly the DOJ representative. Vague claims are insufficient.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Dahil:** Appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review.
*   **People v. Almorfe:** The prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses and the integrity of the evidence.
*   **People v. De Guzman:** Justifiable grounds for non-compliance must be proven as a fact.
*   **People v. Umipang:** Prosecution must establish genuine and earnest efforts in securing the presence of the representatives enumerated. A sheer statement that representatives were unavailable is regarded as a flimsy excuse
*   **People v. Mendoza:** Purpose of witnesses is to avoid tampering/planting of evidence.
*   **People v. Lumaya:** A favorable judgment shall benefit the co-accused who did not appeal
*   **People v. Mamangon**
*   **People v. Miranda:** Prosecutors have the positive duty to prove compliance with the procedure
