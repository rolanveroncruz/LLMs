## Legal Document Summary: *Consertino C. Santos vs. COMELEC*

**Case:** *Consertino C. Santos vs. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 235058) and *Ricardo Escobar Santos vs. COMELEC* (G.R. NO. 235064), consolidated petitions for certiorari and prohibition.

**Nature:** Challenges COMELEC's Writ of Execution (dated November 8, 2017) in SPA Case No. 15-029 (DC), a case declaring Rosalie Isles Roxas a nuisance candidate in the 2016 local elections.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Sec. 69, Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code):** Defines nuisance candidates and authorizes COMELEC to refuse or cancel their certificates of candidacy.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 10083, Sec. 11(K)(b):** Addresses canvassing votes when a candidate has been declared a nuisance. The votes are to be added to candidate that share the same surname as the nuisance candidate.
*   The court also added that in multi-slot office positions, COMELEC should also consider whether the ballots contains both votes for the nuisance and legitimate candidate. In that case, only one count of vote should be credited to the legitimate candidate.

**Obligations:**
*   **COMELEC:** To implement the Writ of Execution (modified as described below), including:
    *   Reconvening the Special Board of Canvassers (SCBOC) of Pasay City.
    *   Re-canvassing votes for Sangguniang Panlungsod members, First District.
    *   Counting votes for Rosalie in favor of Jennifer Roxas, but ensuring no double-counting.
    *   Proclaiming duly elected members based on the re-canvass.
*   **SCBOC:** To follow COMELEC directives and re-canvass the votes.
*   **Director Ester Villaflor-Roxas (member of SCBOC):** To submit a certified true copy of the votes of candidates in the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections.
*   ** COMELEC:** To amend its Resolution No. 10083 to reflect the proper counting of votes in a multi-slot office when there is a nuisance candidate.

**Liabilities/Risks:**
*   **Petitioners (Santos, Escobar Santos, Cuneta):** Risk losing their positions on the Sangguniang Panlungsod if the re-canvass results in Jennifer Roxas gaining enough votes.
*   **COMELEC:** Potential liability if the re-canvass is not conducted fairly and accurately, potentially leading to further legal challenges.
*   **Jennifer Roxas:** If double counting is not prevented, this could result to a legal challenge and a re-count in the future.

**Key Arguments & Court's Rationale:**
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Writ of Execution without due process, in violation of the rule on immutability of judgments, and in violation of COMELEC Resolution No. 10083. They argued that the crediting of votes to Jennifer Roxas was not included in the original COMELEC resolutions. In addition they claimed that votes of a nuisance candidate can only be credited to the legitimate candidate if the decision is final and executory before the proclamation of winning candidate.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Court AFFIRMED the Writ of Execution with MODIFICATION.
    *   The Court ruled that the only real parties in interest in petitions for disqualification of nuisance candidates are the nuisance candidate and the affected legitimate candidate.
    *   The court stated that regardless of whether the judgment becomes final and executory before or after the elections, the votes of the nuisance candidate must be credited to the legitimate candidate with a similar name.
    *   However the court agreed with OSG that the simple arithmetic formula of the COMELEC in a multi-slot office, where there is a nuisance candidate, is inaccurate. Thus, the ballots containing the votes for nuisance candidate Rosalie must be credited in favor of respondent. However, if there are ballots which contain both votes in favor of Rosalie and respondent, only one vote shall be credited in favor of respondent.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   ** *Pamatong v. COMELEC*, 470 Phil. 711 (2004):** Rationale behind prohibiting nuisance candidates.
    *   ** *Bautista v. COMELEC*, 359 Phil. 1 (1998):** Votes for nuisance candidates can be credited even if disqualification is not final before elections.
    *   ** *Martinez III v. HRET*, 624 Phil. 50 (2010):** Nuisance candidate judgment effective as of election day.
    *   ** *Dela Cruz v. COMELEC*, 698 Phil. 548 (2012):** Votes for a nuisance candidate should be credited to the legitimate candidate, even in automated elections.
    *   ** *Timbol v. COMELEC* 754 Phil. 578 (2015):** Discusses minimizing the logistical confusion caused by nuisance candidates,

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Counting:** It is crucial that a double counting of votes is not implemented because it could result to a legal challenge and a re-count in the future.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Legal Challenges:** The modification regarding the re-canvass method (avoiding double counting) could be subject to further legal challenges if improperly implemented.
*   **Timeliness:** The COMELEC is ORDERED to complete the implementation of the November 8, 2017 Writ of Execution, as modified, within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Decision.
