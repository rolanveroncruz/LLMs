## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Onesiforo and Rosario Alinas vs. Spouses Victor and Elena Alinas* (G.R. No. 158040, April 14, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision regarding ownership and possession of two parcels of land.

**Key Issue:** Validity of ownership transfer of two lots from petitioners (Onesiforo & Rosario Alinas, siblings with Victor) to respondents (Victor & Elena Alinas).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners, separated spouses, owned two lots: Lot 896-B-9-A (with bodega) and Lot 896-B-9-B (with house).
*   Lot 896-B-9-A was foreclosed by the Rural Bank of Oroquieta City (RBO) and subsequently sold to respondents.
*   Lot 896-B-9-B was foreclosed by SSS, redeemed by Victor using a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) from Onesiforo, and subsequently sold to respondents via an Absolute Deed of Sale and Agreement, both signed by Onesiforo.
*   Petitioners sued for recovery of possession and ownership, alleging fraud and lack of Rosario's consent.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Respondents are owners of Lot 896-B-9-A (valid acquisition from RBO).
*   Petitioners are owners of Lot 896-B-9-B, the sale to Respondents without consent of his wife being null and void. The redemption from SSS did not confer ownership to them.
*   Petitioners must reimburse Respondents the redemption sum for Lot 896-B-9-B.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Affirmed RTC regarding ownership of Lot 896-B-9-A.
*   Held Onesiforo's sale of Lot 896-B-9-B valid to the extent of his share (1/2) as long as one half of the redemption price with 12% interest is paid by his wife, Rosario.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   **Lot 896-B-9-A:** Affirmed RTC and CA ruling. Respondents validly acquired ownership from RBO. Petitioners' collateral attack on the title (TCT No. T-17394) is impermissible under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.
*   **Lot 896-B-9-B:** Reversed CA. Sale of conjugal property by Onesiforo without Rosario's consent is *void ab initio* in its entirety, pursuant to Article 124 of the Family Code. Cited *Homeowners Savings & Loan Bank v. Dailo* (G.R. No. 153802, March 11, 2005) and *Guiang v. Court of Appeals* regarding the necessity of both spouses' consent for the validity of the sale.
*   **Reimbursement:** Petitioners must reimburse Respondents the redemption amount (P111,110.09) with 6% interest per annum from the filing of the complaint until finality. Post-judgment, interest at 12% per annum applies.
*   **Set-off of Rentals:** Denied set-off of rentals. No proof of rental agreement for the house. Bodega rentals belong to respondents as rightful owners of Lot 896-B-9-A. The courts cannot base a monetary set-off on surmise or conjecture.

**Key Provisions & Case Law:**

*   **Article 124, Family Code:** Sale of conjugal property requires written consent of both spouses; absence renders the disposition void.
*   **Section 48, PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Certificate of Title is not subject to collateral attack.
*   ***Homeowners Savings & Loan Bank v. Dailo* (G.R. No. 153802, March 11, 2005)**: Clarifies application of Article 124.
*    ***De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 158002, February 28, 2005)** - Certificate of title cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.
*   **Articles 526 and 546, Civil Code:** Relates to good/bad faith possessors and rights of the possessor for improvements and reimbursement.
*   **Article 1279, Civil Code:** Requirements for valid compensation or set-off.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*** - Interest on obligations not constituting a loan or forbearance of money is six percent (6%) annually.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of repairs**: No determination of the cost of repairs to the house.
*   **Enforcement of Reconveyance:**  If the Respondents fail to convey Lot 896-B-9-B, Petitioners must proceed under Sec. 10, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **Determination of Filing Date:** Precise filing date of the original complaint is crucial for calculating interest.
*   **Bad faith of respondents:** Although respondents were deemed to be possessors in bad faith under Article 526[28] of the Civil Code, the courts did not deem they acted in bad faith with respect to the validity of the sale.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners (Onesiforo & Rosario):** Must jointly and severally reimburse respondents the redemption amount (P111,110.09) plus interest.
*   **Respondents (Victor & Elena):** Must convey and transfer Lot 896-B-9-B to petitioners and vacate the premises.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are liable for reconveyance of Lot 896-B-9-B.
*   Petitioners are liable for monetary judgment (redemption price plus interest).
