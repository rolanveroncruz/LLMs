## Legal Document Summary: Sulo sa Nayon, Inc. v. Nayong Pilipino Foundation (G.R. No. 170923)

**Nature:** Ejectment case involving a lease agreement.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Sulo sa Nayon, Inc. (now Philippine Village Hotel, Inc. - PVHI) and Jose Marcel E. Panlilio (Senior Executive Vice President).
*   **Respondent:** Nayong Pilipino Foundation (NPF), a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** NPF leased a portion of Nayong Pilipino Complex to Sulo sa Nayon, Inc. (PVHI) in 1975 for 21 years, renewable for 25 years.
*   **Renewal:** The lease was renewed in 1995 via a Voluntary Addendum, extending it until 2021. Monthly rent was set at P20/sqm, subject to 20% increase every 3 years.
*   **Default:** PVHI defaulted on rental payments beginning January 2001, leading to NPF filing an unlawful detainer suit (ejectment) in September 2001.
*   **Improvements:** The lease required PVHI to construct a hotel. The original lease agreement stipulated that the building and improvements belonged to PVHI.

**Obligations:**

*   **PVHI:** To pay rent as per the lease agreement.
*   **NPF:** To allow PVHI quiet enjoyment of the premises so long as the lease terms are upheld.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PVHI:** Liable for rental arrears and reasonable compensation for use of the premises after default.
*   **NPF:** Initially, the RTC held NPF liable to either appropriate the improvements upon payment of indemnity or compel PVHI to purchase the land. This was overturned by the CA and upheld by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Eviction:** PVHI faces eviction from the premises due to non-payment of rent.
*   **Loss of Improvements:** PVHI risks losing the value of the hotel building and improvements if NPF opts not to reimburse for half the value or permit their removal.
*   **Article 1678 Enforcement:** Strict application of Article 1678 could result in PVHI receiving a fraction of the hotel's value.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1657, Civil Code:** Lessee's obligation to pay rent.
*   **C. Vda De Pamintuan v. Tiglao, 53 Phil. 1:** Lessor may eject and treat lease as rescinded upon lessee's failure to pay rent.
*   **Article 448, Civil Code:** Rights of a builder in good faith. *Distinguished - deemed inapplicable here.*
*   **Article 546, Civil Code:** Reimbursement of useful expenses for possessor in good faith. *Distinguished - deemed inapplicable here.*
*   **Jose L. Chua and Co Sio Eng vs. Court of Appeals and Ramon Ibarra, G.R. No. 109840, January 21, 1999:**  A lessee is not considered a possessor in good faith under Art. 448.
*   **Article 1678, Civil Code:** Lessor's obligation to reimburse half the value of useful improvements made by the lessee in good faith, or lessee's right to remove the improvements. *Applied here.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Default Provision (Paragraph 10 of the Lease Contract):** Petitioners argued this provision did not grant NPF the right to appropriate improvements or evict.  The Court disagreed, finding it did not *prohibit* NPF's actions.

**Key Arguments and Holding:**

*   **PVHI argued:**
    *   They were builders in good faith under Article 448 due to the valuable improvements.
    *   Article 1678 should not apply due to the disproportionate value of the hotel versus the debt.
    *   NPF breached the lease contract.
*   **NPF argued:** Unlawful Detainer, PVHI failed to pay rentals

*   **Court Held:**
    *   PVHI is *not* a builder in good faith under Art. 448. Article 448 applies only where one believes they have a claim of title. PVHI, as a lessee, acknowledges NPF's ownership.
    *   Article 1678 of the Civil Code governs the rights of lessee, not Articles 448 & 546.
    *   The lease contract does not explicitly waive the application of Article 1678, and existing laws are deemed incorporated into the contract.
    *   The filing of the ejectment suit by NPF was proper and not a breach of contract.
    *   The court *a quo* did acquire jurisdiction over the case.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision in favor of NPF, ordering PVHI to vacate the premises, pay rental arrears, and reasonable compensation.
