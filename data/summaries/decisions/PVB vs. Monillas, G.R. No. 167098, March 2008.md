**Legal Document Summary: Philippine Veterans Bank v. Benjamin Monillas, G.R. No. 167098, March 28, 2008**

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the RTC decision in a case concerning the validity of a mortgage, foreclosure, and subsequent titles.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Mortgage Validity:** The Court upheld the validity of Philippine Veterans Bank's (PVB) prior registered mortgage over twenty-two (22) lots, despite the subsequent annotation of notices of lis pendens on the titles.
*   **Foreclosure Validity:** The Court affirmed the validity of the foreclosure proceedings initiated by PVB, based on the principle that prior registration of a lien creates a preference. Foreclosure sale retroacts to the date of mortgage registration. *Bank of the Philippine Islands, v. Noblejas, Gonzales v. Intermediate Appellate Court.*
*   **Titles Validity:** The Court declared that the titles (TCT Nos. T-323794 to 323816) issued in PVB's name following the foreclosure are valid and dismissed the action for their cancellation.
*   **Bona Fide Mortgagee:** The Court held that PVB was an innocent mortgagee for value, relying on the clear titles presented at the time of the mortgage. PVB was not required to conduct further investigation and could rely on what was stated in the titles. *Planters Development Bank v. Court of Appeals, Mallorca v. Deocampo, La Urbana v. Bernardo*

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent (Monillas):** Obligated to respect PVB's prior registered mortgage and the resulting titles obtained through foreclosure.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Not obligated to cancel PVB's titles.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Decision:** The Court reversed the RTC decision that found against PVB.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Notice of Lis Pendens:** The primary point of contention was the effect of the lis pendens. The RTC incorrectly held that the lis pendens, even if annotated after the mortgage registration, bound PVB. The Supreme Court clarified that the notice of lis pendens cannot defeat the rights of the mortgagee whose rights derived from prior validly registered mortgage.
*   **Laches:** The court rejected the application of laches due to PVB's delay in registering the sheriff's sale, stating it cannot defeat the enforcement of a legal right, given that the prior mortgage was registered and foreclosed. *Abad v. Guimba.*

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Doctrine of Prior Registration:**  *Lavides v. Pre, Pineda v. Court of Appeals, Gonzales v. Intermediate Appellate Court, Bank of the Philippine Islands, v. Noblejas.* A prior registration of a lien creates a preference.
*   **Innocent Mortgagee for Value:** *Duran v. Intermediate Appellate Court, Planters Development Bank v. Court of Appeals, Mallorca v. Deocampo, La Urbana v. Bernardo.*
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs appeals to the Supreme Court on pure questions of law.
*   **Lis Pendens:** Rehabilitation Finance Corp. v. Morales provides a contradictory ruling stating that a notice of lis pendens affects the rights of the purchaser.

**Ambiguities:** No apparent ambiguities.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court favored PVB, affirming the primacy of its prior registered mortgage and validating the subsequent foreclosure and titles. The decision clarifies the effect of a notice of lis pendens and reinforces the protection afforded to innocent mortgagees for value.
