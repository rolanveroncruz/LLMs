## Legal Document Summary: *Dela Peña v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 177828)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a collection case based on a promissory note.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Obligation:** Petitioners (Dela Peña and Villareal) obtained a loan of P81,000 from Respondent Rural Bank of Bolinao evidenced by a promissory note dated October 20, 1983, payable by October 14, 1984.
*   **Default and Interest:** Petitioners defaulted. The promissory note stipulates interest and penalty charges.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The obligation is imposed on petitioners jointly and severally.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The promissory note includes provisions for attorney's fees.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners' primary obligation is to repay the outstanding principal of P77,722.67, plus 12% interest per annum and 3% penalty charge per annum.
*   Petitioners must also cover accrued interest and penalties as of October 17, 1995.
*   Petitioners must pay litigation expenses and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Monetary judgment against Petitioners includes principal, interest, penalties, litigation expenses, attorney's fees and cost of the suit.
*   Joint and several liability exposes each petitioner to full responsibility for the debt.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement:** The Bank can pursue enforcement through legal means like attachment/garnishment of assets to recover the full judgment amount.
*   **Continuing Interest/Penalties:** Interest and penalties continue to accrue until the debt is fully paid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 14, Article VIII, 1987 Constitution:**  Requires decisions to state facts and law clearly. (Violation was raised as an issue in MTC Decision)
*   **Section 1, Rule 36, Rules of Court:** Mirrors the Constitutional requirement for decisions.
*   **Rule 131, Sec 1, Rules of Court**: Places burden of proof on parties alleging facts (Petitioners failed to prove payment)
*   **Yao v. Court of Appeals, 398 Phil. 86 (2000):**  Reinforces the need for factually and legally supported decisions.
*   **Sierra v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 90270, July 24, 1992, 211 SCRA 785, 795.** and **Henry dela Rama Co v. Admiral United Savings Bank, G.R. No. 154740, April 16, 2008:** Affirms the binding nature of promissory notes.
*   **Section 5, Rule 18 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Deals with failure to appear at pre-trial conference.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Due Process:** Petitioners repeatedly claimed denial of due process due to procedural issues in lower courts (failure to allow presentation of evidence, lack of notice of pre-trial). However, the Supreme Court found these claims unsubstantiated given multiple opportunities provided to petitioners.
*   **MTC Decision Deficiencies:** The MTC decision was found to be deficient for not clearly stating the legal basis, but the Supreme Court opted to resolve the case on the merits instead of remanding it further.
*   **Interest Rates:** The decision imposes a 12% interest and 3% penalty from 1984 until full payment. The legality of these interest rates should be carefully examined under applicable usury laws at the time the loan was contracted. Potential grounds to challenge exorbitant rates may exist.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The P40,000 attorney's fees awarded warrants scrutiny for reasonableness. While attorney's fees are stipulated in the promissory note, the amount awarded must be justified based on the complexity of the case and the services rendered.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the Petitioners, finding they were not denied due process and failed to prove the defense of payment.  While the MTC decision was initially flawed, the Court resolved the case based on the promissory note's established debt. However, there might be some possibility of a challenge to the interests and attorney's fees awarded, warranting further investigation into the legality and reasonableness of these charges.
