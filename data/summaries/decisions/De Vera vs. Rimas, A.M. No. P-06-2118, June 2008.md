**Legal Document Summary: *De Vera v. Rimas*, A.M. No. P-06-2118, June 12, 2008**

**Nature:** Administrative case concerning grave misconduct (dishonesty, falsification of public documents, and harassment) and neglect of duty.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Teofila C. De Vera, Legal Researcher II, RTC Branch 92, Calamba City.
*   **Respondent:** Anthony E. Rimas, Utility Worker, RTC Branch 92, Calamba City.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   De Vera alleges Rimas falsified his Daily Time Records (DTRs) for multiple months in 2003, discrepancies between DTRs and daily attendance sheets.
*   De Vera claims Rimas filed a prior administrative case (OCA IPI No. 04-1846-P) against her as harassment to compel her to sign off on his DTRs.
*   De Vera accuses Rimas of neglecting his duties, resulting in an unclean office, and falsely representing himself as a sheriff.
*   Rimas denies all allegations, asserting the accuracy of his DTRs and efforts to maintain cleanliness. He counter-alleges that De Vera confiscated his keys and harassed him while cleaning, further claiming that she had made libelous statements towards him.

**Findings & Ruling:**

*   The Court finds Rimas guilty of falsification of official documents and dishonesty based on evidence that his DTRs did not accurately reflect his actual hours worked.
*   The Court Administratorâ€™s report, based on Executive Judge Santiago's investigation of the prior case (OCA IPI No. 04-1846-P/ A.M. No. P-04-1905), was adopted, confirming the falsification. The prior administrative case filed by Rimas was dismissed due to lack of merit.
*   The Court explicitly acknowledges the importance of integrity and ethical conduct for judicial employees under Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).
*   Rimas is suspended for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay, with a stern warning against future misconduct. Dismissal, a potential penalty under the Civil Service Commission's Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases (Resolution No. 991936), was not imposed because this was Rimas' first offense.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 171:** Punishes falsification.
*   **Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 991936 (Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service):**  Specifies penalties for grave offenses like dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification. Sections 52 A (1), (3), and (6) are explicitly referenced regarding the definition and penalties for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents.
*   **Case Law:**
    *   *Re: Findings of Irregularity on the Bundy Cards of Personnel of the RTC, Br. 26 and MTC Medina, Misamis Oriental, A.M. No. 04-11-671-RTC, 14 October 2005, 473 SCRA 1, 12.*
    *   *Re: Falsification of Daily Time Records of Maria Fe P. Brooks, Court Interpreter, RTC, Quezon City, Br. 96, A.M. No. P-05-2086, 20 October 2005, 473 SCRA 483, 487-488.*
    *   *Corpuz v. Ramiterre, A.M. No. P-04-1779, 25 November 2005, 476 SCRA 108, 121.*
    *   *A Very Concerned Employee and Citizen v. Lourdes S. De Mateo, Clerk III, MTCC, Korondal City, South Cotabato, A. M. No. P-05-2100, 27 December 2007.*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While Rimas' lack of prior offenses was considered a mitigating factor, the Court could have imposed a more severe penalty had there been a history of misconduct. Future violations will likely result in harsher sanctions.
*   **Falsification of DTRs:**  The case underscores the importance of accurate record-keeping and the potential for severe consequences stemming from falsification, especially in the judiciary.
*   **Libel Claims:** Rimas' counter-allegation of libel by De Vera was not explicitly addressed, potentially leaving room for a separate legal action.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The ruling is largely based on the findings of the Executive Judge from the earlier administrative case, suggesting a reliance on previously gathered evidence and testimony. The extent of independent corroboration in this specific case is unclear.
