## Legal Document Summary - *David, Jr. vs. People* (G.R. No. 136037)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Severino David, Jr. and Timoteo Gianan for Frustrated Homicide under Article 50 in relation to Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.  Gianan did not join David in filing the Petition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Frustrated Homicide (Art. 50, in relation to Art. 249, RPC). Elements include intent to kill, performance of all acts of execution, and failure to produce death due to causes independent of the accused's will.
*   **Penalty Imposed (RTC & Affirmed by CA):** Indeterminate imprisonment of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of *Prision Correccional* (min) to 8 years and 1 day of *Prision Mayor* (max), with accessory penalties, plus damages for actual losses (P9,946.05) and unearned income (P12,000.00).
*   **Defense:** Self-defense. David claimed the victim, Datalio, initiated the attack with a fan knife, and David acted to protect himself, unintentionally stabbing the victim.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   David & Gianan are obligated to serve the imposed sentence and pay damages if the conviction stands.
*   The State has the obligation to prove the elements of Frustrated Homicide beyond reasonable doubt.
*   David bore the burden of proving self-defense by clear and convincing evidence once he admitted to inflicting the stab wound. *Macalino vs. People*, 340 SCRA 11 (2000).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Failure:** The Court found David's self-defense claim to be unconvincing, citing inconsistencies in his testimony and failure to promptly report the incident to police. The Court applied the established requisites for self-defense: unlawful aggression by the victim, reasonable necessity of the means employed, and lack of sufficient provocation by the accused. The absence of initial unlawful aggression negated the plea, referencing *Toledo vs. People* G.R. No. 158057.
*   **Conspiracy:** Although Gianan did not appeal, the Court still upheld the RTC's finding of conspiracy between David and Gianan based on their concerted actions during the attack. This means that Gianan's liability remains solid. *People vs. Reyes* (G.R. No. 135682) defining conspiracy was cited.
*   **Factual Issues:** The primary issue raised was the misappreciation of facts.  The Supreme Court generally avoids reviewing factual findings, particularly those relating to witness credibility, deferring to the trial court's observations. (e.g. *People vs. Cañete, G.R. No. 138366*)
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Discrepancies between David's testimony and the evidence presented by the police (SPO3 Montallana) and the victim’s own statements were used to discredit the defense.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Article 11 (Self-defense), Article 50 (Frustrated Homicide), Article 249 (Homicide).
*   Rules of Court: Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari).

* *Toledo vs. People*, G.R. No. 158057, 439 SCRA 94, September 24, 2004
**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, affirming the conviction for Frustrated Homicide. The Court found no reversible error in the lower courts' factual findings and deemed David's self-defense claim untenable due to inconsistencies and the lack of unlawful aggression. The Petition was denied.
