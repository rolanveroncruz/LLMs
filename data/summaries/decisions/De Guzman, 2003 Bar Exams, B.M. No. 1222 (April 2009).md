**Legal Document Summary: B.M. No. 1222 (Re: 2003 Bar Examinations)**

**Nature:** Resolution regarding a Petition for Judicial Clemency and Compassion by Atty. Danilo de Guzman, previously disbarred for leaking Mercantile Law bar exam questions in 2003.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Prior Disbarment:** Atty. De Guzman was disbarred effective February 4, 2004, due to his involvement in the 2003 Bar exam leakage. He downloaded test questions from the examiner's (Balgos) computer and faxed them to others.
*   **Petition for Clemency:** De Guzman seeks reinstatement to the Philippine Bar, citing remorse, subsequent good conduct, and public service.
*   **OBC Recommendation:** The Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) favorably recommended reinstatement based on De Guzman's remorse, public service, and testimonials of good moral character.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Court *partially* grants the petition. The disbarment is **commuted to a 7-year suspension** from the practice of law, reckoned from February 4, 2004. Since he already served 5 year disbarment it was ordered he had two more years left.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Past Misconduct:** De Guzman remains liable for compromising the integrity of the bar examinations. The commutation of the penalty acknowledges the seriousness of the offense but balances it with considerations of rehabilitation and public service.
*   **Future Conduct:** The Resolution includes a stern warning that De Guzman, if reinstated, is bound to uphold the law more sacredly and be an example to the body politic. Any future misconduct could have severe consequences, potentially leading to permanent disbarment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Relapse:** The Court acknowledges the possibility of future misconduct, thus the stern warning.  Any subsequent disciplinary action could result in permanent disbarment.
*   **Public Perception:** Despite the endorsements and testimonials, some members of the public might still harbor skepticism or distrust towards De Guzman due to the bar exam leakage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **In Re: Carlos S. Basa:** Cited by Petitioner for the Court's compassion towards a young attorney convicted of a crime, seeking similar treatment.
*   **Re: Petition of Al Argosino to Take the Lawyer's Oath (Bar Matter 712):** Used to support the idea of giving a chance to an individual who has shown efforts to atone for past misdeeds.
*   **Rodolfo M. Bernardo vs. Atty. Ismael F. Mejia (Administrative Case No. 2984):** Applied to determine if the court will take in consideration the conduct of the applicant before and after disbarment, the nature of their crime, and the time passed to determine if they should be reinstated.
*   **Valencia v. Antiniw (A.C. No. 1302, 1391, 1543):** Cites the case of Valencia wherein they showed remorse and repentance through civic humanitarian activities and unblemished record as an elected public servant to be reinstated.
*   **Bernardo v. Atty. Mejia (A.C. No. 2984):** Cites that if the respondent has shown remorse and has learned their lesson through experience the can be reinstated if they are in advanced age.
*   **Barrios v. Martinez (A.C. No. 4585):** Sets forth the high standard of conduct expected of lawyers and the severity of violating the law.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision to commute the penalty might be seen as lenient by some, considering the gravity of the offense (compromising bar exam integrity). The reasoning relies heavily on De Guzman's remorse and public service.
*   The resolution fails to account for the time passed in his disbarment and ordered him to serve two more years.

**Overall:**

This resolution balances the need to maintain the integrity of the legal profession with considerations of rehabilitation and compassion. While the Court is willing to give De Guzman a second chance, it makes it clear that future transgressions will not be tolerated. This creates both an opportunity and a significant risk for De Guzman's future career.
