Okay, here's a legal summary of the *Citytrust Banking Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Ramon Raagas, Charlito Lagda And Renato Memita*, G.R. No. 123318, August 20, 1998, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *Citytrust Banking Corporation vs. NLRC et al.* (G.R. No. 123318)**

**Issue:** Whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Citytrust and the security guards/armored car personnel (Raagas, Lagda, Memita) assigned to them by security agencies (ADAMS, ESSI). The central question is whether the bank is responsible for the guards' termination.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court reversed the NLRC decision, holding that no employer-employee relationship existed between Citytrust and the security guards. The guards were employees of the security agencies. The illegal dismissal complaint against Citytrust was dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Contractual Agreements:**  The contracts between Citytrust and the security agencies (ADAMS and ESSI) explicitly stated that personnel assigned to Citytrust were employees of the agencies, not Citytrust. (See Annexes C & D). These agreements included stipulations regarding the agency's responsibility for discipline, control, and supervision. This highlights contractual freedom.
*   **Four-Fold Test:** The Court applied the four-fold test to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship:
    *   **Selection and Engagement:** The security agencies hired the guards, not Citytrust.
    *   **Payment of Wages:** The security agencies paid the guards' salaries, not Citytrust.
    *   **Power of Dismissal:**  Citytrust could request replacement of guards, but the security agencies ultimately held the power to dismiss.
    *   **Power of Control:** Citytrust was interested only in the result of the security services provided, not in the means and methods used to achieve those results. This implies a contractual business relationship rather than employment.

*   **Independent Contractor:** The security agencies (ADAMS and ESSI) were legitimate independent contractors, not "labor-only" contractors (See *Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemicals Philippines, Inc., vs. NLRC, 217 SCRA 249, 255-258 (1993)*). They possessed sufficient capital and equipment. This is crucial because "labor-only" contracting could lead to a finding that the client (Citytrust) is the true employer.
*   **Nature of Work:** The Court emphasized that the guards performed the functions expected of them as security personnel under contract between the security agencies and the bank. The guards were essentially performing the role of securing and safeguarding the assets of the bank; which is within the scope of employment of the agency.

*   **Previous DOLE Ruling:** The NLRC erroneously relied on a previous DOLE ruling (affirmed by a minute resolution in G.R. No. 95143) involving different security guards from a different agency (PSVSIA) who were drivers of armored cars, not security personnel of the bank, in a certification election case. That case did not involve the present parties or the specific issues at hand. The principle of *res judicata* does not apply due to the difference in parties and subject matter.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Control":** The line between a client specifying desired outcomes and improperly controlling the *means* of achieving those outcomes can be blurred. If Citytrust had exerted excessive control over the *manner* in which the guards performed their duties, it could have strengthened the argument for an employer-employee relationship.
*   **"Power of Dismissal" Ambiguity:** While Citytrust could request replacements, the actual process and extent of influence over *dismissal* requires close scrutiny. If Citytrust effectively dictated dismissals, it could suggest more employer-like power.
*   **Future Claims:** This case sets a precedent, but future claims will be fact-dependent. Security agencies and banks must ensure their contractual agreements clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of each party to mitigate the risk of future misclassification disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   *Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemicals Philippines, Inc., vs. NLRC, 217 SCRA 249, 255-258 (1993)*:  Cited regarding independent contractors.
*   Four-fold Test: Generally derived from jurisprudence related to determining employer-employee relationships, specifically regarding right of control.
*   *Res judicata*: Though not explicitly mentioned by name in the decision, the court dismissed NLRC's reliance on the earlier DOLE ruling due to different parties and subject matter.
*   Labor Code: While not directly cited, the Labor Code is the foundational statute governing employer-employee relationships and illegal dismissal claims in the Philippines.
