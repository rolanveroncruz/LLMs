**Case Summary: Republic of the Philippines v. Leonor Macabagdal, G.R. No. 227215 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision regarding the applicable interest rate on unpaid just compensation in an expropriation case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Expropriation:** DPWH expropriated a 200 sq. m. lot owned by Leonor Macabagdal for the C-5 Northern Link Road Project.
*   **Just Compensation:** RTC set just compensation at P9,000.00/sq. m. based on the Commissioner's Report, considering market value, location, and comparable cases (RA 8974, Section 5 parameters considered by CA).
*   **Interest:** RTC initially imposed a 12% p.a. interest rate from the time of taking until full payment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Republic (DPWH):** Obligated to pay the balance of the just compensation (P9,000/sq. m less the initial deposit of P550,000) plus interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Republic (DPWH):** Liable for interest on the unpaid balance of just compensation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Rate:** The primary contention is the applicable interest rate.
    *   **Initial Issue:** The DPWH argued for a 6% interest rate based on BSP-MB Circular No. 799 (effective July 1, 2013).
    *   **Resolution:** The Supreme Court modified the CA decision, applying a *dual interest rate regime*:
        *   12% p.a. from the date of taking (issuance of Writ of Possession - May 5, 2008) until June 30, 2013.
        *   6% p.a. from July 1, 2013, until full payment.
    *   **Reasoning:** The delay in payment constitutes a forbearance of money, entitling the landowner to interest. BSP-MB Circular No. 799 applies to forbearances in expropriation cases from its effectivity.
*   **Date of Taking:** The Court clarified that interest accrues from the issuance of the Writ of Possession (May 5, 2008), not the filing of the complaint, as that is when deprivation occurs. This contrasts with the RTC's original order and establishes the basis for calculating the interest.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8974, Section 5:**  Guidelines for determining just compensation.
*   **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board (BSP-MB) Circular No. 799, Series of 2013:**  Reduced the legal interest rate for loans or forbearance of money.
*   **Act No. 2655 (Usury Law):** The basis for legal interest rates as amended by subsequent regulations and rulings.

**Case Law:**

*   **Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways v. Sps. Tecson, 758 Phil. 604 (2015):** Confirmed the principle that just compensation should cover the market value at the time of taking.
*   **Apo Fruits Corp. v. Land Bank of the Phils., 647 Phil. 251 (2010):** Reiterates the income-generating potential of property and the need for full and immediate compensation.
*   **Republic v. Mupas, 769 Phil. 21 (2015):** Relevant for determining when the “taking” occurs in expropriation cases.
*   **Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic, G.R. Nos. 218628 and 218631, September 6, 2017:** Upholds the application of BSP Circular 799 to expropriation cases.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Heirs of Ramoran, G.R. No. 193455, June 13, 2016, 793 SCRA 211:** Addressed the issue of interest rate for just compensation.
*   **Sy v. Local Government of Quezon City, 710 Phil. 549 (2013); Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco, 464 Phil. 83 (2004):** Distinguished as decided before BSP-MB Circular No. 799 took effect.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention was the proper interest rate, which was ultimately resolved by applying the BSP-MB Circular 799 prospectively.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case involves the expropriation of land for a DPWH infrastructure project. The key legal issue concerns the applicable interest rate on the unpaid balance of the just compensation. While the RTC initially awarded 12% interest from the date of taking, the Supreme Court, citing *Evergreen Manufacturing Corp.* and other recent jurisprudence, modified the ruling to apply a 12% rate until June 30, 2013, and 6% thereafter, pursuant to BSP-MB Circular No. 799. Crucially, the date of "taking" for interest calculation is defined as the issuance of the Writ of Possession (May 5, 2008). This case clarifies the application of Circular 799 in expropriation cases and highlights the importance of the *Writ of Possession* date in determining interest accrual.
