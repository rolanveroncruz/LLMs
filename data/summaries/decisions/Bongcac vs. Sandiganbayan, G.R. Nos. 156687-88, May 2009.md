**Case Summary: Bongcac v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 156687-88, May 21, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition seeking to set aside the Sandiganbayan Resolution denying the suspension of execution of judgment in two Estafa cases (Crim. Case Nos. 18005 & 18006).

**Facts:** Petitioner Panfilo Bongcac, as representative of the Mayor of Tagbilaran City, received funds from private respondents Lim and Bon for the construction of market stalls. The funds were not accounted for, nor were the stalls constructed. He was convicted of two counts of Estafa under Article 315, 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code. His initial appeal to the Supreme Court (G.R. Nos. 149711-12) was denied and became final. Subsequently, he filed a "Very Urgent Petition for Extraordinary Relief" to reopen the case, which was also denied. He then filed the current petition to prevent the execution of the Sandiganbayan's judgment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 315, 1(b), Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Estafa, the crime of which Bongcac was convicted. The specific subsection involves fraudulent misappropriation or conversion.
*   **Section 22, Rule 114, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Provides for the automatic cancellation of bail upon execution of a judgment of conviction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Bongcac is liable for two counts of Estafa, resulting in imprisonment terms as specified in the Sandiganbayan decision (4 years, 2 months to 11 years for Criminal Case No. 18005; and 2 years, 3 months, 5 days to 9 years for Criminal Case No. 18006).
*   **Civil Liability:** Bongcac is liable to indemnify Engr. Fortunato Lim P54,000.00 + P10,000.00 attorney's fees and Toribio Bon P35,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Immutability of Final Judgments:** The core risk is the doctrine that final judgments are immutable, barring exceptional circumstances. No such circumstances existed here. *Lim v. Jabalde*, G.R. No. 36786, 17 April 1989, 172 SCRA 211, highlights the importance of finality.
*   **Dilatory Tactics:** The Court perceived Bongcac's subsequent petitions as mere dilatory tactics to avoid execution, potentially leading to sanctions for frivolous litigation.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Bongcac's argument hinged on grave abuse of discretion by the Sandiganbayan, implying a lack of jurisdiction. The Court rejected this argument.
*   **Procedural Issues:** The Very Urgent Petition for Extraordinary Relief was not sanctioned by the Rules of Court and was considered a second bite at the apple.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315, 1(b):** Estafa
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 114, Section 22:** Cancellation of Bail
*   **Lim v. Jabalde, G.R. No. 36786, 17 April 1989, 172 SCRA 211:** Immutability of Final Judgments

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There were no directly ambiguous or contentious clauses within the document but the petitioner tried to bring out certain loopholes to delay the finality of the case.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed Bongcac's petition, affirming the Sandiganbayan's Resolution. The ruling emphasizes the principle of immutability of final judgments and rejects attempts to delay execution through repetitive or improper legal maneuvers. The petitioner's bail was validly cancelled. The risk of any further appeal is extremely low, and execution of the judgment should proceed.
