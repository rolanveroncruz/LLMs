**Case Summary: *People v. Booc*, G.R. No. 143959 (February 19, 2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The lower court sentenced the accused to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 315(2)(d) RPC:** Defines estafa as committed by postdating a check, or issuing a check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no funds or insufficient funds in the bank. Failure to cover the check within three days of notice of dishonor constitutes *prima facie* evidence of deceit.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 818 (Amendment to Article 315 RPC):**  Specifies penalties for estafa based on the amount of fraud.  For amounts exceeding P22,000, the penalty is *reclusion temporal* in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional P10,000 (subject to a 30-year cap, termed *reclusion perpetua* for accessory penalty purposes).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to determine the appropriate range of imprisonment, considering the amount misappropriated (P100,000).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Booc's Obligations:** To provide sufficient funds to cover the issued checks, or to make good on the checks upon dishonor. Failure to do so established criminal liability for estafa.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay Msgr. Kintanar P80,000 as actual damages and to pay the costs of suit. The P20,000 partial payment was taken into consideration.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of "Obligation Contracted at the Time Check was Issued":** The court found that the checks induced Fr. Kintanar to procure the loan and give the money to Booc, establishing that the issuance of checks was simultaneous with the obligation. A potential argument could have been raised if the checks were given merely as security for a pre-existing debt, which would have negated the estafa charge.
*   **Dishonor & Notice:** While not explicitly stated, a proper notice of dishonor and opportunity to make good on the checks are crucial elements for establishing *prima facie* evidence of deceit. The document implies this occurred, but details are lacking.
*   **Erroneous Transmittal from the Court of Appeals:** The Supreme Court acknowledged a procedural error (as outlined in *People v. Mateo*, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 7 July 2004) where the Court of Appeals should have rendered judgement but refrained from entering it and instead certified the records to the Supreme Court.  This indicates that the Court of Appeals did not conduct intermediate review. The Supreme Court disregarded the error "pro hac vice" (for this occasion only) due to Booc's advanced age and the length of time the case had been pending.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Reyes, G.R. No. 154159, 31 March 2005, 454 SCRA 635:** Used to define the elements of estafa under Article 315(2)(d) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 7 July 2004, 433 SCRA 640:** Cites as reference of Procedural infirmities of the Court of Appeals.
*   **Firaza v. People, G.R. No. 154721, 22 March 2007, 518 SCRA 681:** Cited as basis of the penalty to be imposed to the accused
*   **Perez v. People, G.R. No. 150443, 20 January 2006, 479 SCRA 209, citing People v. Gabres, G.R. Nos. 118950-54, 6 February 1997, 267 SCRA 581; People v. Saley, 353 Phil. 897 (1998); Ong v. Court of Appeals, 449 Phil. 691 (2003):** Used as reference to the basis of determining the penalty to be imposed.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 315(2)(d)
*   Presidential Decree No. 818

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Booc's conviction for estafa, modifying the penalty to an indeterminate sentence of 6 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 24 years, 4 months, and 1 day of *reclusion perpetua*, plus accessory penalties and payment of actual damages (P80,000) and costs. The decision hinges on the finding that the postdated checks induced Fr. Kintanar to part with his money, satisfying the elements of estafa under Article 315(2)(d) of the RPC. While the erroneous procedure of the Court of Appeals in elevating the case was noted, the Supreme Court waived this defect due to the defendant's age and the case's duration.
