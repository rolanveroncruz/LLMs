**Case Summary: *Pureza v. Court of Appeals, Asia Trust Development Bank and Spouses Alejandro (G.R. No. 122053, May 15, 1998)***

**Core Issue:** Whether Asia Trust Development Bank ("Bank") was negligent in releasing loan proceeds to contractors (Spouses Alejandro) for the construction of Petitioner Pureza's house, and whether the Bank and Spouses Alejandro should be held jointly and severally liable for damages due to incomplete/defective construction.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Construction Agreement:** Petitioner Pureza contracted with Spouses Alejandro (Boncris Trading and Builders) for house construction.  Financing was obtained via a Pag-Ibig Housing Loan from Asia Trust Development Bank.  Pureza signed an *Order of Payment* authorizing the bank to release funds to the contractors.
*   **Disbursement & Completion:** Petitioner claimed construction was only 70% complete, yet the Bank released 90% of the loan proceeds. He also stated that the Bank had released 90% of the proceeds of the loan, except for the sum of fourteen thousand pesos (P14,000.00) which the Bank applied to amortizations.
*   **Certificate of Completion/Acceptance:** A significant point is the *Certificate of House Completion/Acceptance* signed by Pureza. The Bank relied on this to release funds.
*   **Lower Court Ruling:**  The RTC found the Bank negligent in releasing funds and ordered the Bank to pay a sum of forty-eight thousand pesos (P48,000.00) representing twenty-eight percent (28%) of the net proceeds of the loan which it was found to have negligently delivered to defendant spouses. The spouses were, in turn, ordered to reimburse the Bank the said amount. Both the Bank and the spouses were ordered to pay to plaintiff the sum of forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00) representing the cost of repair on the house of plaintiff where defective or inferior materials were used; moral damages in the amount of two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00); exemplary damages in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00); the sum of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.000) as attorney's fees; and the costs of suit.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Reversed the RTC decision, dismissing the complaint against the Bank.  The CA emphasized that the Bank acted according to Pureza's *Order of Payment* and *Certificate of Completion/Acceptance.*

**Key Obligations & Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Bank's Obligation:** To disburse loan proceeds according to the agreement and authorized payment orders.  Potential liability for negligence *if* it deviated from the agreed disbursement schedule or ignored clear evidence of non-completion *before* releasing funds.
*   **Contractor's Obligation:** To complete construction according to the contract.  Potential liability for breach of contract, defective workmanship, and damages. (Note: The appeal of Spouses Alejandro was dismissed for failing to pay docket fees. Their liability, if any, wasn't directly addressed by the Supreme Court in this decision).
*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To repay the loan.  Potential liability for defaulting on loan payments.

**Legal Principles & Statutory References:**

*   **Estoppel (Art. 1431 Civil Code, Rule 131, Section 3(a) Rules of Court):**  The Supreme Court invoked estoppel. Because Pureza signed the *Order of Payment* and *Certificate of Completion/Acceptance*, he was prevented from later claiming the Bank was negligent in relying on those documents. The court emphasizes that a party cannot falsify their previous acts.
*   **Contract Law:** The ruling implicitly acknowledges the enforceability of the Construction Agreement and related documents (Order of Payment, Certificate of Completion).
*   **Duty of Care/Negligence:** The case hinges on whether the Bank breached a duty of care in disbursing funds. The Court found no negligence because the Bank acted according to Pureza's explicit instructions and certification.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** The court denied joint and solidary liability between the bank and contractors, as the Bank did nothing beyond its contractual obligations according to petitioner's instructions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **"Certificate of Completion/Acceptance":**  The validity and interpretation of this document were central. Petitioner argued that the house wasn't actually complete or built to specifications, rendering the certificate questionable. However, the timing of the ocular inspection made it difficult to ascertain the condition of the house at the time of the certificate signing.
*   **Modifications to the Contract:** The decision mentions the reduction of costs through cancellation of finishing works. Any ambiguity regarding these modifications and their impact on the original contract specifications could be contentious.
*   **Ocular Inspection:** The weight given to the ocular inspection was a point of contention. The CA correctly observed that passage of time had elapsed since the completion certificate was signed.

**Potential Risks Moving Forward:**

*   **Deficiency Claim:** The bank can pursue a deficiency claim (if any exists) against the petitioner. The foreclosure on the mortgage may not have covered the entire obligation.
*   **Contractor Dispute:** Though not a party in the Supreme Court review, the petitioner may have a separate cause of action against the contractors.
*   **Defense of Laches:** The contractor may also have a laches defense, due to passage of time from the execution of the contract and the signing of the completion certification.
