## Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-08-2109

**Case:** *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Judge Moises M. Pardo and Clerk of Court Jessie W. Tuldague*

**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding grave and disrespectful conduct (Judge Pardo's complaint) and counter-allegations of impropriety (Tuldague's claims) related to raffle procedures in the RTC Cabarroguis, Quirino.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Judge Pardo's Complaint:** Tuldague, Clerk of Court, allegedly acted disrespectfully by excluding the Judge from the raffle of cases, sending notices only to OIC Branch Clerks.
*   **Tuldague's Defense:**  He had used the same notice format for years without objection. He filed a counter-complaint alleging Judge Pardo improperly took records of Land Registration Case No. 264-05 without raffle, violating procedure. He also alleges Judge Pardo refused to sign Sheriff's Certificate of Sale of Extra-Judicial Foreclosure Cases.
*   **OCA Findings:**
    *   Dismissed Judge Pardo's initial complaint for lack of merit, citing acquiescence to Tuldague's procedure.
    *   Found Tuldague guilty of violating Supreme Court Circular No. 7-2002 (regarding raffle of extrajudicial foreclosure cases) for personally conducting a raffle in the judge's absence.
    *   Found Tuldague guilty of Gross Discourtesy, citing disrespectful behavior and language toward Judge Pardo.
    *   Found Judge Pardo’s explanation on LRA Case no. 264-05 satisfactory.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **A.M. No. 99-10-05-0 (as amended by Circular No. 7-2002):**  Procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure raffles, requiring Executive Judge supervision and Clerk of Court assistance. Violation of this is a central issue.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 3-98:** Order of assignment of Sheriff’s in Extra-Judicial Foreclosures.
*   **Rule IV, Section 52 (B) (3) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:**  Basis for the finding of gross discourtesy. Punishable by suspension for one month and one day to six months.
*   **Case Law on Conduct of Judiciary Employees:** *Amane v. Atty. Mendoza-Arce*, citing *Macalua v. Tiu, Jr.*, emphasizes the requirement for courtesy, prudence, and respect from judiciary employees.
*   **Doctrine of *Res Ipsa Loquitur*:** Applied to Tuldague's behavior, meaning the facts speak for themselves regarding his misconduct.
*   **Case Law on appropriate penalty:** *Angeles v. Base*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Tuldague:** Liable for violating the Supreme Court circular regarding extrajudicial foreclosure raffles and for gross discourtesy.
*   **Judge Pardo:** No Administrative liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Disrespectful Conduct":**  The initial complaint hinges on this, which is inherently subjective. The Court's finding of *gross discourtesy* is more concrete due to the documented disrespectful language.
*   **Procedural Ambiguity:** The issue highlights potential ambiguity in the interpretation and implementation of the raffle procedure, leading to the conflict.
*   **Escalating Conflict:**  The exchange of letters indicates a pre-existing and escalating personal conflict between the Judge and Clerk of Court, potentially affecting court operations.

**Outcome:**

*   Complaint against Judge Pardo dismissed.
*   Tuldague reprimanded for violating Supreme Court Circular No. 7-2002.
*   Tuldague fined the equivalent of one month and one day's salary for gross discourtesy.
