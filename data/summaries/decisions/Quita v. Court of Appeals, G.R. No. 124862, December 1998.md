Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Fe D. Quita v. Court of Appeals and Blandina Dandan* (G.R. No. 124862, December 22, 1998)

**Summary:**

This case concerns a dispute over the intestate estate of Arturo Padlan, focusing on determining his legal heirs.  The central issue is the validity and effect of a U.S. divorce obtained by Fe D. Quita (Arturo's first wife) in 1954, and its impact on her right to inherit.  Also, a second woman, Blandina Dandan, claims to be the surviving spouse of Arturo Padlan.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Foreign Divorce:** The SC examines the lower court's reliance on *Tenchavez v. Esca√±o* (15 SCRA 355), which held that a foreign divorce between Filipino citizens is not valid in the Philippines. The court also discusses *Van Dorn v. Romillo, Jr.* (139 SCRA 139) where the court ruled that aliens may obtain divorces abroad.
*   **Citizenship:**  Critical is Fe Quita's citizenship at the time of the divorce. The court emphasizes that if Quita was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time of the divorce, *Van Dorn* applies, potentially validating the divorce and stripping her of inheritance rights.
*   **Illegitimate Children:** The court addresses the inheritance rights of the Padlan children, acknowledging proofs of recognition by the deceased which entitled them to one-half of the estate (with exception of Alexis, whom the trial court recognized as an illegitimate child).
*   **Void Second Marriage:** The court affirms the trial court's ruling that Blandina Dandan is not an heir because her marriage to Arturo was bigamous, occurring while Arturo was still married to Fe Quita.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The Court of Appeals (CA) correctly remanded the case to the trial court, finding that a full hearing was required under Rule 90, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court to resolve the heirship controversy. The original trial court improperly decided the issue without a full hearing, particularly regarding Fe Quita's citizenship.

**Obligations:**

*   The Regional Trial Court (RTC) is obligated to conduct a hearing to determine Fe Quita's citizenship at the time of her divorce from Arturo.
*   Fe Quita bears the burden of proving her citizenship, or lack thereof, at the time of the divorce decree.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   If Fe Quita was no longer a Filipino citizen at the time of the divorce, the divorce may be recognized in the Philippines, potentially disqualifying her from inheriting from Arturo.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The date of Fe Quita's alleged acquisition of American citizenship (1954, the same year as the divorce) presents a factual ambiguity that requires evidentiary resolution.
*   The exact terms of the 1950 separation agreement and its legal effect on marital property are not fully addressed but could be relevant to the final distribution.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code of the Philippines (Articles 80, 83, 190, 191, 998, 1001)
*   Rules of Court (Rule 90, Sec. 1)
