**Case Summary: People v. Bandoquillo, G.R. No. 218913 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for qualified rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code. The CA affirmed the RTC's guilty verdict with modifications, including finding the accused ineligible for parole and awarding exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Charge:** Rape, committed with a knife, using force, threat and intimidation against his own daughter, "AAA," a minor below 18 years of age.
*   **Conviction:** Qualified rape under Article 266-B (victim under 18, offender is a parent).
*   **Sentence:** Reclusion perpetua. Parole Ineligible.
*   **Damages Awarded:**
    *   Civil indemnity: P100,000.00 (Modified by SC)
    *   Moral damages: P100,000.00 (Modified by SC)
    *   Exemplary damages: P100,000.00 (Modified by SC)

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused, Romulo Bandoquillo, is liable for the crime of qualified rape.  The CA affirmed the RTC conviction for the crime, and was modified by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Accused maintains the appeal challenging credibility of the victim.
*   Accused alleges an "inconsistency" on the victim's testominy regarding consummation of the crime.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A & B, Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape and provides for aggravating circumstances (victim's age and relationship to offender).
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262:** Violence Against Women and their Children (VAWC).
*   **People v. Ortoa, 599 Phil. 232 (2009):**  Establishes that full penetration is not necessary for consummation of rape, penetration of the labia suffices.
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016:** Ruling pertaining to amount of damage awards in rape cases, applied for modification of the damages.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Consummation" of the Rape:** Defense argued inconsistency in victim's testimony regarding penetration. The SC, aligning with *People v. Ortoa*, found no material inconsistency as entry into the labia is sufficient. This highlights the importance of defining "carnal knowledge" in relation to the crime of rape, especially in cases involving minors.
*   **Resistance:** Defense argued lack of significant resistance. The Court reiterated that resistance is not a necessary element and is less crucial when the perpetrator holds a position of moral ascendancy (father).

**Key Takeaways:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision (with modification to damages amount), emphasizing the credibility afforded to trial court findings, especially when affirmed by the CA.  It also highlights jurisprudence on what constitutes consummated rape and dispenses with the resistance argument, particularly in cases of familial sexual abuse, due to the vulnerability of the child and the ascendancy of the father.
