**Case Summary: *Field Investigation Unit v. Raquel A. De Castro*, G.R. No. 232666 (2018)**

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in downgrading the respondent's administrative liability from Grave Misconduct to Simple Misconduct.

**Facts:**

*   Raquel A. De Castro (Respondent) was the Municipal Accountant of Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro.
*   The Municipality engaged in transactions with businesses owned by her husband ("Pink Enterprises") and daughter ("Pink Splash Resort") from 2006-2010.
*   Respondent certified and approved disbursement vouchers for these transactions.
*   FIU charged Respondent with Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and Grave Misconduct for violating Section 89 of RA 7160 (Local Government Code), which prohibits local government officials from engaging in business transactions with the LGU they serve, and Section 341 Prohibitions Against Pecuniary Interest.
*   The Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon found her guilty of Grave Misconduct, resulting in dismissal with accessory penalties.
*   The CA modified the decision, finding her guilty of Simple Misconduct only.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the CA decision and **reinstated** the Ombudsman's decision finding Respondent liable for Grave Misconduct.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Section 89, R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Prohibits local government officials and employees from engaging in business transactions with the LGU where they are employed if payment comes from LGU resources.
*   **Section 341, R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Prohibits pecuniary interest for local treasurers, accountants, budget officers in business with LGU. Violation results in administrative liability.
*   **Section 344, R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Outlines requirements for disbursement of local funds, including certification by the local budget officer, accountant, and treasurer.
*   Respondent, as Municipal Accountant, had a duty to ensure compliance with Section 89 and Section 344. Her certification of disbursement vouchers for transactions involving her family's businesses constituted a violation of these provisions.
*   **Grave Misconduct:** Defined as intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of law with elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office, cancellation of civil service eligibility, and bar from taking civil service examinations.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Sections 89, 341, 344.
*   **Imperial, Jr. v. Government Service Insurance System, 674 Phil. 286 (2011):** Defines "flagrant disregard of rules" as a ground for grave misconduct.
*   **Japson v. Civil Service Commission, 663 Phil. 665 (2011):** Highlights the importance of honesty and integrity in public service and the potential damage caused by public perception of corruption.
*   **Administrative Order No. 07, as amended by Administrative Order No. 17**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The SC emphasized that administrative findings require only substantial evidence (relevant evidence a reasonable mind accepts as adequate). The SC found substantial evidence to support Grave Misconduct, in contrast to the CA's finding of Simple Misconduct.
*   **"Flagrant Disregard":** The SC cited Respondent's *repeated* violations over a four-year period as indicative of flagrant disregard, distinguishing it from mere Simple Misconduct. This highlights the significance of consistent or multiple violations.
*   **Knowledge/Intent:** While Respondent argued she merely certified the completeness of documents, the SC found that her awareness of the family connection, coupled with her position, made her certification a knowing violation. Knowledge of potential conflict of interest is critical to determining gravity of misconduct.
*   The case does not detail the specific amount of money involved in the transactions, which could influence the assessment of the "flagrant disregard" element.
*   The argument of "good faith" was explicitly rejected by the Court.
