**Legal Document Summary: *Gomez vs. Judge Belan and Atty. Angeles* (A.M. No. MTJ-97-1119)**

**Type:** Administrative Complaint against a Judge and a Lawyer

**Core Issue:** Propriety of ex parte order in an ejectment case.

**Facts:**

*   An ejectment case was pending before Judge Belan. Atty. Angeles, representing the plaintiffs (Arandia Spouses), filed a "Motion to Enter Premises and Render Judgment" alleging abandonment by the defendants (Gomez Spouses) and seeking permission to enter the property.
*   Judge Belan granted the motion ex parte, authorizing the breaking of the padlock.
*   The Sheriff, Atty. Angeles, a police officer, and one of the plaintiffs entered the property, confirming the abandonment, and secured the premises.
*   The Gomez Spouses filed an administrative complaint against Judge Belan for "gross ignorance of the law" and against Atty. Angeles for "deliberately misleading the Court" alleging lack of due process.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Order to Enter Premises:** Judge Belan's ex parte order granting entry to the premises.
*   **Due Process:** The central issue revolves around the lack of notice and opportunity to be heard for the Gomez Spouses before the order was issued.
*   **Obligation to Inform Court of Address:** The court highlighted the complainants' obligation to inform the court of their new address after vacating the premises.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Judge Belan:** Initially faced potential disciplinary action for issuing an ex parte order without proper due process. However, the complaint was ultimately dismissed with an admonishment. This highlights the risk of judicial errors when failing to follow proper procedure.
*   **Atty. Angeles:** Accused of misleading the court and failing to provide notice. While the complaint was dismissed, it demonstrates the potential for ethical violations when seeking ex parte relief without diligent attempts to notify opposing parties.
*   **Risk of Prejudicial Action:** The Gomez Spouses argued that the ex parte order was a premature execution of judgment while the ejectment case was still pending, but the finding of abandonment nullified this point.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   The decision implicitly touches upon principles of procedural due process, particularly the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard.
*   The decision implies reference to the Rules of Court concerning ejectment proceedings and motions.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ex parte nature of the order and the absence of formal notification to the Gomez Spouses.
*   The reliance on the allegation of abandonment as justification for the ex parte order without prior verification through proper hearing.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of ex parte orders, especially in possessory actions. While the abandonment ultimately justified the actions taken, the initial lack of due process could have led to disciplinary action. The dismissal hinged on the factual finding of abandonment, which rendered the procedural defects moot. A lawyer should note the importance of:

1.  **Diligence in Notification:** Even when seeking ex parte relief, counsel has a duty to make reasonable efforts to notify the opposing party.
2.  **Judicial Restraint:** Judges must exercise caution in granting ex parte orders, particularly those that affect property rights, without proper notice and hearing, regardless of perceived merit. The lack of diligence can be seen as gross misconduct if prejudice is caused.
3.  **Client Responsibility:** Litigants have a continuing obligation to keep the court informed of their current address. Failure to do so can have negative consequences.
4.  **Administrative vs. Judicial Remedies:** The Supreme Court reiterated that administrative proceedings are not a substitute for available judicial remedies.

**Conclusion:**
The administrative complaint was dismissed due to the factual finding of abandonment which essentially mooted the due process violation; the case serves as an example of proper procedure and the consequences of failing to uphold said procedure.
