**Legal Document Summary: Cebu Filveneer Corporation vs. NLRC and Villaflor (G.R. No. 126601)**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari and prohibition challenging NLRC's decision finding illegal dismissal and awarding separation pay, backwages, moral damages, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal of Jessielyn Villaflor (Chief Accountant). The SC ruled that the employer's (Cebu Filveneer) grounds for dismissal (breach of trust, gross negligence due to failure to immediately report a missing check, and alleged overpayment of 13th-month pay) were insufficient under Article 282 of the Labor Code.
*   **Breach of Trust/Gross Negligence:** SC held that Villaflor's failure to immediately report the blank check incident, while negligent, was not "willful" or "gross," lacking the intent to prejudice the employer.  The record showed Villaflor made a report to Cordaro.
*   **Overpayment of 13th Month Pay:** The NLRC's finding that the 13th-month pay claim was part of her compensation package was unrefuted and was determined to be a later justification to justify her dismissal.
*   **Backwages:** SC affirmed the award of backwages.
*   **Moral Damages & Attorney's Fees:** The SC *reversed* the NLRC's award of moral damages and attorney's fees. The court reasoned Villaflor was negligent and the employer's actions, although unlawful, were not in bad faith.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The SC *absolved* Carlo Cordaro (President) from solidary liability, as he acted in his capacity as corporate officer and in good faith.

**Obligations:**

*   Cebu Filveneer Corporation is obligated to pay separation pay and backwages to Jessielyn Villaflor.

**Liabilities:**

*   Cebu Filveneer Corporation is liable for separation pay and backwages.  Carlo Cordaro, in his personal capacity, is not liable.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Quantification of Backwages:** While the SC affirmed backwages, the exact amount remains subject to computation and compliance.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcement of the judgment against Cebu Filveneer Corporation may present practical challenges if the corporation lacks sufficient assets.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282, Labor Code:** Defines just causes for termination of employment.
*   **Republic Act No. 6715:** Amends the Labor Code, specifically Article 279, regarding security of tenure and backwages.
*   **Bustamante vs. NLRC (G.R. No. 111651):**  Cited for the principle of "full backwages" without deduction for earnings during illegal dismissal.
*   **Citibank, N.A. vs. Gatchalian, 240 SCRA 212:** Definition of "gross negligence"

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The fact that Villaflor did not report the blank check and voucher immediately were not deemed to be gross or willful enough to serve as grounds for dismissal.
