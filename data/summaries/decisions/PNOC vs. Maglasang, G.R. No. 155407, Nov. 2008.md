## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine National Oil Company vs. Leonilo A. Maglasang and Oscar S. Maglasang* (G.R. No. 155407)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming with modification the RTC Joint Judgment in two consolidated expropriation cases.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC)
*   **Respondents:** Leonilo A. Maglasang & Oscar S. Maglasang (Landowners)

**Subject Matter:** Determination of just compensation for two parcels of land expropriated by PNOC for the Upper Mahiao Geothermal Power Plant Project.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Expropriation:** PNOC filed complaints for eminent domain against respondents for Lot No. 11900 (63,333 sqm) and Lot No. 11907 (98,206 sqm) in 1994. RTC issued writs of possession after provisional deposit.
*   **Just Compensation:** The RTC initially set just compensation at P300/sqm, then increased it to P700/sqm, factoring in "inflation" and "adjustment". The CA modified the ruling, setting just compensation back to P300/sqm, plus 6% interest from the filing of the complaints.
*   **Time of Taking:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA and RTC findings that the "taking" occurred at the time of filing the expropriation complaints (1994), not in 1992 when PNOC initially leased Lot 11900. The Court relied on *Republic v. Castellvi*, stating that a lease does not constitute a permanent deprivation of ownership or beneficial use amounting to "taking."
*   **Land Classification:** The Court upheld the lower courts' classification of the land as "industrial" at the time of taking, based on the Commissioners' Report and reclassification by local government units. The court further stated that issues raised for the first time on appeal and not raised timely in the proceedings in the lower court are barred by estoppel.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision to set just compensation at P300/sqm with 6% interest from the date of filing the complaints, deeming the lower courts' factual findings conclusive.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PNOC:** Obligated to pay just compensation to the landowners at P300/sqm, plus 6% interest from October 25, 1994 (Civil Case No. 3267-O) and November 10, 1994 (Civil Case No. 3273-O) until full payment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Interest Accrual:** The 6% interest accrues from the filing dates (1994) and could significantly increase the total financial burden on PNOC due to the delay in final resolution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:**  Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 67, Section 5, Rules of Court:**  Governs ascertainment of just compensation in expropriation cases through commissioners.
*   ***Cosculluela v. Court of Appeals*** **(164 SCRA 393):**  Cited by the RTC (but later rejected by the CA) to justify applying an "inflation factor" to just compensation.
*   ***Republic v. Lara*** **(96 Phil. 170):**  Cited regarding the principles of computing just compensation.
*   ***Republic v. Castellvi*** **(58 SCRA 336):**  Key case defining "taking" in expropriation cases, differentiating it from lease agreements.
*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Section 20:** Regarding the power of local government units to reclassify and convert lands.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Inflation Factor" and "Adjustment Factor":** The RTC's initial attempt to apply these factors to the valuation was deemed erroneous by the CA and ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, emphasizing the importance of valuing the land at the time of taking and applying legal interest for delays in payment.
