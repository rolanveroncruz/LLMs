**Legal Document Summary: Rivac v. People (G.R. No. 224673)**

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Date:** January 22, 2018

**Issue:** Whether the CA correctly upheld Rivac's conviction for Estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Also, the propriety of the RTC reopening the case.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming Rivac's conviction for Estafa, but modified the penalty due to Republic Act (RA) 10951.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 315(1)(b) RPC (Estafa):** Defines Estafa as misappropriation or conversion of property received in trust, on commission, or under an obligation to deliver or return.
*   **Consignment Agreement:** Rivac received jewelry from Fariñas under a consignment agreement, obligating her to remit proceeds or return the jewelry within seven days.
*   **Obligation to remit/return:** Rivac failed to remit proceeds or return the jewelry, prompting Fariñas to demand compliance.
*   **RA 10951 (Adjustment of Penalties):** Retroactively amended Article 315 RPC, adjusting the thresholds for penalties based on the value of the property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty of Estafa under Article 315(1)(b) RPC.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay Fariñas P439,500.00 (value of misappropriated jewelry) plus 6% legal interest from the finality of the decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defining Estafa through misappropriation/conversion with abuse of confidence.
*   **Section 24, Rule 119 of the 2000 Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Governs the reopening of criminal cases for further trial.
*   **Republic Act No. 10951:** Adjusted the value of property and damages on which penalties are based, retroactively benefiting the accused.
*   **Cheng v. People:** Defines the essence of Estafa as the appropriation or conversion of money or property received to the prejudice of the entity to whom a return should be made.
*   **Cabaries v. Maceda:** Expounds on the novelty, nature, and parameters of Rule 119, Section 24 (Reopening of Criminal Cases).
*   **People v. Lamsen:** Thorough discussion on the nature and probative value of recantations.
*   **People v. Dahil:** An appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Recantation of Testimony:** Fariñas's attempt to recant her initial testimony was viewed with suspicion. This raises questions regarding the credibility of witnesses and the potential for external influence.
*   **Validity of Consignment Agreement:** Rivac claimed she was only made to sign a blank consignment document and the transaction was actually a loan.

**Potential Risks and Concerns:**

*   **Evidentiary challenges:** Recanted testimony is often unreliable and can significantly impact the outcome of a case.
*   **Miscarriage of justice:** Allowing or disallowing retractions should only be done when the paramount interest of justice is at stake.
*   **Application of Parol Evidence Rule:** The ruling emphasizes that absent any of the allowed exceptions to the parol evidence rule, Rivac is not allowed to present evidence to modify, explain, or add to the terms of the said document.

**Note:** The court properly allowed the reopening of proceedings to receive Fariñas's subsequent testimony in order to shed light on the true nature of her transaction with Rivac and potentially, determine whether or not the latter is indeed criminally liable.
