## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. CIR, G.R. No. 174942

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision in *Bank of the Philippine Islands vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 174942, dated March 7, 2008.

**Issue:**  Appeal by BPI challenging the CTA decision that held BPI liable for deficiency Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) on cabled instructions to its foreign correspondent bank (SWAP transactions) for the years 1982-1986 and that the government's right to collect had not prescribed.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court *GRANTED* BPI's petition, reversing the CTA decision. The government's right to collect the deficiency DST had prescribed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Assessment & Collection Period (Tax Code of 1977, Sec. 318):** The CIR had three (3) years from the date of assessment (April 7, 1989) to collect the deficiency DST. The deadline was April 6, 1992.
*   **Suspension of Statute of Limitations (Tax Code of 1977, Sec. 320):** The statute of limitations is suspended *only* if the CIR *grants* the taxpayer's request for reinvestigation. This is a crucial point.
*   **Deficiency DST Assessment:** P24,587,174.63 for the period 1982-1986.
*   **Interest:**  CTA initially ordered BPI to pay 20% interest starting February 14, 2003.  However, this is moot due to the SC reversal based on prescription.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the CTA found BPI liable for the deficiency DST and interest.
*   The Supreme Court overturned this ruling, freeing BPI from liability because the government's right to collect the DST had prescribed.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **CIR's Failure to Grant Reinvestigation Request:**  The core of the case hinges on the CIR's failure to expressly or impliedly grant BPI's protest letters (treated as requests for reinvestigation). Without a formal grant, the statute of limitations was *not* suspended.
*   **Waivers:** BPI executed waivers of the statute of limitations, but the last one expired on December 31, 1994. The CIR even conceded the waiver was void for lacking a date of acceptance per RMO No. 20-90. Crucially, no collection effort was made after the waiver expired until 2002, long after the prescriptive period.
*   **Nature of Cabled Instructions:** BPI argued cabled instructions on SWAP transactions were not subject to DST under the 1977 Tax Code. The SC did not rule on this due to the finding of prescription.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wyeth Suaco Laboratories, Inc. (G.R. No. 76281):** Distinguished.  Unlike Wyeth Suaco, there was no evidence of actual reinvestigation or communication of action taken on BPI's request.
*   **Collector of Internal Revenue v. Suyoc Consolidated Mining Company, et al. (104 Phil. 819):** Distinguished. BPI's actions did not induce the CIR to delay collection.
*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Ablaza (108 Phil. 1105):**  Cited in support of the principle of strict interpretation of the law on prescription to protect taxpayers.
*  **BPI v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 139736):** Cited on the rule that CIR must first grant request for reinvestigation as a requirement for the suspension of statute of limitations.
*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Gancayco:** Cited on the act of requesting a reinvestigation alone does not suspend the period.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of BPI's protest letters as *requests for reinvestigation* â€“ the CIR argued this, but the SC emphasized the requirement of a formal *grant* of that request.
*   The validity and effectivity of the waivers of the statute of limitations - the CIR's concession that the waivers were void weakens their argument for the suspension of the prescriptive period.

**Strategic Implications:**

*   This case reinforces the importance of the CIR formally acting upon requests for reinvestigation within the prescriptive period.  Silence or inaction by the CIR favors the taxpayer.
*   Taxpayers should meticulously track deadlines and waivers to ensure the government does not attempt collection beyond the prescribed period.
*   The case highlights the burden of proof on the CIR to demonstrate that a request for reinvestigation was granted to suspend the statute of limitations.
