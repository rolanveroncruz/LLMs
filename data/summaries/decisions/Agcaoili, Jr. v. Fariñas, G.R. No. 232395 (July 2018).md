## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 232395 (Agcaoili, Jr. v. Fariñas)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (En Banc)

**Date:** July 3, 2018

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Pedro S. Agcaoili, Jr. et al. ("Ilocos 6"), employees of Ilocos Norte Provincial Government, joined by Maria Imelda Josefa "Imee" R. Marcos (then Governor).
*   **Respondents:** Representatives Rodolfo C. Fariñas, Johnny T. Pimentel, and Lt. Gen. Roland Detabali (Ret.) as Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives; Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability.

**Subject Matter:** Legislative inquiry regarding the use of Ilocos Norte's share from excise taxes on Virginia-type cigarettes (RA 7171), focusing on vehicle purchases.

**Legal Issues:**

1.  **Mootness:** Whether the release of the "Ilocos 6" from detention renders the Petition for Habeas Corpus moot.
2.  **Assumption of Jurisdiction:** Whether the Supreme Court can assume jurisdiction over a Habeas Corpus Petition already pending before the Court of Appeals (CA).
3.  **Prohibition:** Whether the legislative inquiry can be enjoined by a writ of prohibition.
4.  **Amparo:** Whether the Omnibus Petition states a cause of action for the issuance of a writ of Amparo.
5. **Judicial Privilege:** What are the boundaries of judicial privilege in relation to congressional inquiry.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **House Resolution No. 882:** Directs an inquiry into the use of excise taxes by the Ilocos Norte Provincial Government, alleging violations of RA 7171, RA 9184, and PD 1445 regarding vehicle purchases.
*   **Contempt Citation:** The "Ilocos 6" were cited for contempt by the House Committee for allegedly being evasive during the legislative inquiry.
*   **Habeas Corpus Petition (CA):** Filed by the "Ilocos 6" challenging their detention. The CA initially issued a writ but later dismissed the case as moot.
*   **Petition for Prohibition (Marcos):** Seeking to enjoin the legislative inquiry as illegal and in excess of jurisdiction.
*   **Petition for Amparo (All Petitioners):** Seeking protection from alleged violations of rights to liberty and security of person.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **DISMISSED** the Omnibus Petition.

*   **Habeas Corpus:** The release of the "Ilocos 6" rendered the Habeas Corpus Petition moot. The Court cannot assume jurisdiction over a terminated case. The Court reiterated that the element of illegal deprivation of freedom of movement or illegal restraint is jurisdictional in petitions for habeas corpus.
*   **Prohibition:** A writ of prohibition can lie against legislative functions, but no justification exists in this case. The inquiry is within the scope of Congress's power to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation (Art. VI, Sec. 21, Constitution), is not solely to gather incriminatory evidence, and respects the rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries. Marcos' apprehension of arrest is speculative.
*   **Amparo:** The privilege of the writ of Amparo is confined to instances of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances, or threats thereof. The alleged unlawful restraint has ceased, and Marcos's apprehension is speculative. Furthermore, pursuing the Amparo petition in the Supreme Court while the Habeas Corpus Petition was pending in the CA was procedurally improper.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential for Contempt:** The ruling underscores the power of Congress to cite individuals in contempt for failing to cooperate with legitimate legislative inquiries.
*   **Separation of Powers:** The ruling acknowledges the separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislative branch and the judiciary's duty to avoid interfering with the exercise of constitutionally delegated legislative powers.
*   **Risk of Repetitive Claims:** The Court warns against seeking Amparo relief on "amorphous and uncertain grounds."

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article VI, Section 21:** Power of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation.
*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Sections 1, 5, 6:** Judicial power, jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and administrative supervision over all courts.
*   **RA 7171:** Development of farmers in Virginia tobacco-producing provinces.
*   **RA 9184:** Government Procurement Reform Act.
*   **PD 1445:** Government Auditing Code of the Philippines.
*   **RA 9851** Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity
*   **Rule on the Writ of Amparo:** Requirements for petitioning for a writ of Amparo.
*   **Arnault v. Nazareno, 87 Phil. 29 (1950):** Power of inquiry is essential to legislative function.
*   **Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo, 589 Phil. 1 (2008):** Defined coverage of the Amparo Rule.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of "inquiry in aid of legislation":** While the Court states that the inquiry must be in furtherance of legislation, the line between legitimate inquiry and a "fishing expedition" gathering incriminatory evidence can be difficult to define.
*   **Judicial Privilege:** Boundaries of what constitutes internal deliberation and actions in exercise of adjudicatory functions that constitute the exercise of judicial power.

**Analysis for Legal Counsel:**

This decision reaffirms the broad scope of Congress's power of inquiry in aid of legislation while simultaneously acknowledging the separation of powers doctrine. The Court emphasized the necessity of an actual threat to life, liberty, or security for issuance of a writ of Amparo. Key risks remain related to Congressional contempt powers, the potential for claims of legislative inquiries overstepping into judicial functions, and the importance of demonstrating concrete threats to justify extraordinary remedies. The Court carefully sought to delineate the application of judicial privilege, warning it will not be upheld for actions external to the judiciary's adjudicatory functions.
