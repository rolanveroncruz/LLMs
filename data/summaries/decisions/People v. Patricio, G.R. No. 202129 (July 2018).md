## Legal Document Summary: People v. Patricio, G.R. No. 202129 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for violation of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sections 5 and 11, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the sale and possession of dangerous drugs (specifically, methamphetamine hydrochloride or *shabu*). The prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Establishes a strict procedure for handling seized drugs to ensure integrity and evidentiary value. This includes:
    *   Immediate marking of seized items by the apprehending officer.
    *   Physical inventory and taking of photographs in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official.
    *   Turnover to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours for examination.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Erroneous Conviction:**  Risk of wrongful imprisonment due to flawed chain of custody procedures.
*   **Inadmissible Evidence:**  Drugs seized without proper adherence to Section 21 could be deemed inadmissible, leading to acquittal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165:** The primary statute governing dangerous drugs, sale and possession.
*   **Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (as amended by R.A. No. 10640):** Emphasizes strict chain of custody requirements. *People v. Doria, People v. AÃ±o, People v. Gayoso, People v. Calvelo, People v. Dimaano, People v. Havana, People v. Siaton, People v. Gatlabayan, People v. Ismael*  and other related cases.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC reiterated that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty *does not* apply when there is deviation from procedure.  The presumption of innocence of the accused prevails over the presumption of regularity when the chain of custody is flawed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Practicability" exception in Section 21:**  The decision highlights that even when a situation may seem not to meet the standard of perfection, the officers of the law must still conduct its performance properly.
*   **Marking requirements:** The document suggests that if the marking does not follow the standards of due process and is open to questions, the prosecution of a case would suffer and the benefit of the doubt should go to the accused.

**Summary of SC Ruling & Deficiencies in Prosecution's Case:**

The SC reversed the CA and RTC decisions, acquitting Evelyn Patricio due to reasonable doubt.  The prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because:

1.  **Failed to Mark Seized Drugs:** The apprehending officers *did not* mark the seized *shabu* immediately after confiscation, creating a break in the chain of custody and raising doubts as to whether the drugs presented in court were the same ones seized from the accused.
2.  **Absent Testimony of P/SInsp. Batiles:**  A critical link was missing as P/SInsp. Batiles, to whom the drugs were allegedly turned over, *did not* testify to confirm the integrity and identity of the drugs he received.
3.  **Unexplained Markings:**  The markings "EP 1a," "EP 1b," and "EP 2" on the plastic sachets were *not* explained by any prosecution witness.
4.  **Failure to Inventory & Photograph:**  The police officers *failed* to conduct a physical inventory and take photographs of the seized drugs as required by Section 21, without providing any acceptable explanation for the noncompliance.
5.  **Presumption of Regularity Inapplicable:** Given the evidentiary gaps and procedural violations, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty *could not* be invoked.
