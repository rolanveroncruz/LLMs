## Legal Document Summary: *China Banking Corporation vs. Sps. Martir* (G.R. No. 184252)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the Court of Appeals decision and reinstating the RTC decision upholding the validity of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Mortgage:** Sps. Martir executed real estate mortgages on three parcels of land in favor of China Banking Corporation (CBC) to secure a credit line of P1,800,000.00.
*   **Default:** Sps. Martir defaulted on their loan obligations, leading to a demand letter and eventual foreclosure.
*   **Foreclosure:** CBC extrajudicially foreclosed the properties, acting as the sole bidder at the public auction. A Certificate of Sale was issued in favor of CBC and registered.
*   **Redemption:** Sps. Martir attempted to redeem the properties, but their offer was deemed insufficient due to a lack of actual tender of the full redemption price.

**Obligations:**

*   **Sps. Martir:** Original obligation to repay the loan plus interest as stipulated in the promissory notes. Obligation to tender the full redemption price to effectively redeem the foreclosed properties within the statutory period.
*   **CBC:**  As creditor and purchaser, follow statutory requirements for the notice, publication, and foreclosure of the mortgaged properties.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sps. Martir:** Liability for the outstanding loan amount plus interest. Loss of the right to redeem the properties due to failure to tender full payment within the redemption period.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **CBC:** While ultimately successful, the initial Court of Appeals ruling highlighted potential issues with the publication of the foreclosure notice, specifically regarding whether the *Sun Star* newspaper was considered a newspaper of "general circulation". Litigation expenses.
*   **Sps. Martir:** Loss of properties due to a validly executed and registered foreclosure sale.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages, particularly Section 3 regarding notice requirements (posting and publication).
*   **Presidential Decree 1079:** Governs the publication of legal notices in newspapers of general circulation.
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines (Art. 1616):** Outlines obligations to repay when purchasing back.
*   **A.M. No. 01-1-07-SC:** Guidelines in the Accreditation of Newspapers and Periodicals Seeking to Publish Judicial and Legal Notices. Determined to not be applicable in this case.
*   **Jurisprudence regarding newspapers of general circulation:** The Supreme Court emphasized that lack of accreditation is not conclusive of being not considered a newspaper of general circulation. Furthermore, the Court underscored the importance of *actual* tender of full payment for redemption.
*   ***Olizon v. Court of Appeals*** and ***Cristobal v. Court of Appeals*** highlighted the publication requirements and their significance.
*   ***Metrobank v. Pe√±afiel***: The case states that accreditation by the presiding judge is not conclusive.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of a "newspaper of general circulation" under PD 1079 was central to the initial dispute. The CA focused on *accreditation*, while the SC focused on *actual circulation* and whether the newspaper was devoted to a particular interest group.
*   The sufficiency of Sps. Martir's "formal tender of redemption" was contentious. The SC ruled that a mere offer to redeem, without actual tender of the full redemption price, is insufficient.

**Key Takeaway:** The Supreme Court prioritizes *actual circulation* over *accreditation* for newspapers publishing foreclosure notices, and it strictly enforces the requirement of *actual tender of full payment* for redemption. While procedural requirements must be followed, substantial compliance is sufficient if the purpose of the law (informing the public) is achieved.
