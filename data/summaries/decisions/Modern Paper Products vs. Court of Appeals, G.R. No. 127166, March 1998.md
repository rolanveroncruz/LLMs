## Legal Document Summary: Modern Paper Products, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 127166)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lacked jurisdiction to include Spouses Alfonso and Elizabeth Co in a petition for suspension of payments filed by Modern Paper Products, Inc. (MPPI).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5(d) of P.D. No. 902-A (as amended by P.D. No. 1758):** Grants the SEC original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide petitions for suspension of payments *only* for corporations, partnerships, or associations.
*   **Spouses' Obligations:** The Spouses Co executed suretyship agreements in their *personal capacity* to secure MPPI's obligations, as explicitly stated in their petition.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MPPI:** Potentially liable for its debts subject to the outcome of the rehabilitation proceedings.
*   **Spouses Co:** Potentially liable under the suretyship agreements, as their personal assets were offered as security for MPPI's debts.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:**  The SEC's jurisdiction is strictly limited to entities specified in P.D. 902-A, which does not include individuals.
*   **Estoppel:** The Spouses Co are estopped from arguing that they acted in their official capacity when executing the suretyship agreements due to their representations in the petition.
*   **Suretyship Agreements:** The enforceability of the suretyship agreements against the Spouses Co remains a key point of contention. The court's decision affirms the risk of personal liability arising from these agreements.
*   **Mortgage Lien:** The Court of Appeals clarified that the appointment of a management committee for MPPI did not automatically extinguish the mortgage liens held by Metrobank and PS Bank on MPPI's property.  This preserves the banks' secured creditor status.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 902-A:**  Defines the SEC's jurisdiction, particularly Section 5(d) concerning suspension of payments.
*   **P.D. No. 1758:**  Amends P.D. No. 902-A.
*   **Chung Ka Bio v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 163 SCRA 534 (1988):**  Cited to reinforce that the SEC's jurisdiction is limited to corporations, partnerships, and associations; it does not extend to individuals.
*   **Union Glass & Container Corp. v. SEC, 126 SCRA 31, 39 (1983); DMRC Enterprises v. Este del Sol Mountain Reserve, Inc., 132 SCRA 293 (1984):** Used to support the limited jurisdiction of administrative agencies like the SEC, only able to exercise powers explicitly granted to them by enabling statutes.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether the Spouses Co acted in their official capacity vs. personal capacity when signing as sureties. However, the court sided with the latter based on their own statements in the petition.

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

This case reaffirms the principle that the SEC's jurisdiction under P.D. 902-A is strictly limited to petitions for suspension of payments filed by corporations, partnerships, and associations. The Court correctly held that the SEC lacked jurisdiction to include the Spouses Co in MPPI's petition. The spouses are estopped from denying their personal liability as sureties based on their explicit representations in the initial petition. The ruling underscores the importance of clear and accurate representations in legal filings, especially concerning personal guarantees of corporate debt. The mortgage liens held by Metrobank and PS Bank remain valid despite the appointment of a management committee. The implications for practitioners are to carefully assess the proper forum for filing suspension of payments or rehabilitation petitions, ensuring compliance with the jurisdictional limitations of administrative agencies like the SEC.
