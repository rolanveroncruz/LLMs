## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Veedor, Jr.* G.R. No. 223525

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Benedicto Veedor, Jr. for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal possession of dangerous drugs â€“ marijuana). The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the CA decision and acquitted Veedor due to a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and reasonable doubt regarding the *corpus delicti*.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The statutory basis for the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Specifies the procedures for handling seized illegal drugs, requiring immediate physical inventory, photographing, and witnessing by the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, and a representative from the National Prosecution Service or the media. (Amended by Republic Act No. 10640).

**Key Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Lack of Corpus Delicti:** The SC found that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the marijuana presented in court was the same as that seized from the accused.
*   **Broken Chain of Custody:** The SC identified significant gaps in the chain of custody, primarily relating to the proper marking, inventory, and handling of the seized drugs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Improper Marking & Inventory:** The NBI agents failed to properly mark and account for the 323 plastic sachets of marijuana, raising doubts about their origin and handling. The court considered the discrepancy in the description of the seized dangerous drugs.
*   **Inconsistencies in Descriptions:** There was a discrepancy between the description of the seized drugs ("dried marijuana leaves") in the initial reports and the description by the forensic chemist ("crushed dried marijuana flowering tops"). This inconsistency was not clarified.
*   **Missing Documentary Evidence:** The prosecution failed to submit the original or duplicate original copy of the Inventory of Seized Property. The omission of photographs taken during the operation further weakened the evidence.
*   **Witness Testimony:** Barangay Chairman Francisco's testimony contradicted the prosecution's narrative regarding the seized items, raising further doubts about the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Unexplained Custody Gaps:** The prosecution failed to identify all individuals who handled the seized evidence between its initial turnover to the Forensic Chemistry Division and its presentation in court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 11, Article II:** Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21, Article II (as amended by RA 10640):** Chain of Custody requirements.
*   **People v. Denoman, 612 Phil. 1165 (2009):** Emphasized the importance of preserving the identity and integrity of the *corpus delicti* due to the unique characteristics of illegal drugs.
*   **Derilo v. People, 784 Phil. 679 (2016):** Enumerated the links in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Quintana, 256 Phil. 430 (1989):** Discrepancies in the description of the seized marijuana can create reasonable doubt.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The unexplained presence of an "SM plastic bag" not mentioned in the initial reports.
*   The RTC's dismissal of the Barangay Chairman's testimony as speculation, rather than considering its impact on the credibility of the prosecution's evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The SC found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody and raised reasonable doubt regarding the *corpus delicti*. The failure to properly mark, inventory, and account for the seized drugs, coupled with inconsistencies in descriptions and unexplained gaps in custody, led to the acquittal of the accused. This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 to ensure the integrity of drug-related prosecutions.
