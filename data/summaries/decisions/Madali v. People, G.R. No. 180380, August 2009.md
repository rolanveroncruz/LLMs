**Case:** *Raymund Madali and Rodel Madali vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 180380, August 4, 2009)

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming with modifications the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Raymund and Rodel Madali for Homicide in the death of AAA.  The prosecution's case hinges on the testimony of eyewitness Jovencio, who identified Raymund, Rodel and Bernardino as the perpetrators. The defense presented alibis.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Homicide Conviction:** The RTC initially convicted Raymund, Rodel, and Bernardino of homicide.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The conviction relies heavily on Jovencio's testimony. Jovencio witnessed the assault and identified the accused.
*   **Recanted Affidavit:** Jovencio executed an affidavit recanting his initial statement but later reverted to his original account, which he attributed to threat from a relative of the accused
*   **Alibi Defense:** The accused presented alibis, which the lower courts rejected as insufficient.
*   **Age of Accused:** Raymund was 14 at the time of the crime, Rodel was 16, and Bernardino age is not stated in the document.

**Obligations:**

*   **Civil Liability:** Despite Raymund being exempt from criminal liability due to his age, he and Rodel are solidarily liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and temperate damages to the victim's heirs.
*   **Rodel (Remand):** Rodel's case is remanded to the court a quo for further proceedings in accordance with Section 38 of Republic Act No. 9344 after having been found guilty of Homicide.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Civil Liability of Raymund and Rodel:** Jointly and severally liable for P50,000 civil indemnity, P50,000 moral damages, and P25,000 temperate damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Jovencio's recanted affidavit and minor inconsistencies in testimony are potential weaknesses that could be exploited, although the courts found him credible.
*   **Alibi Corroboration:** The alibi defense rested on the testimonies of relatives and friends, which the Court views with skepticism, weakening its overall impact.
*   **Discernment of Rodel:** Rodel was 16 at the time of the crime, and the CA deemed that he acted with discernment pursuant to Sections 6 and 38 of Republic Act No. 9344, justifying the sentence after finding the defendant guilty of homicide and subsequently ordering his case to be remanded back to court a quo for further proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari
*   **Republic Act No. 9344 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006):**  Retroactively applied to exempt Raymund from criminal liability and suspends Rodel's sentence (Sections 6, 20, 38). This case law provides minimum age of criminal responsibility and requires a determination of whether a minor acted with discernment.
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Article 22 (retroactive effect of penal laws), Article 68 (penalty for offenders under 18), Article 249 (homicide), and Rule 5 of Article 62 (habitual criminal).
*   **People v. Matito, 468 Phil. 14, 24 (2004):** Regarding the trial judge's role in assessing witness credibility.
*   **People v. Castillo, G.R. No. 118912, 28 May 2004, 430 SCRA 40, 50:** Conclusiveness and binding effect of lower court findings when affirmed on appeal.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 603 (Child and Youth Welfare Code):** Provides procedures for involuntary commitment of neglected or abused children.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision. Raymund is exempt from criminal liability but remains civilly liable. Rodel's sentence is suspended and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with Section 38 of Republic Act No. 9344.
