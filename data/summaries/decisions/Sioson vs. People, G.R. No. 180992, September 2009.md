## Legal Document Summary: *Diamante v. People*, G.R. No. 180992 (2009)

**Nature of the Document:**  Decision of the Supreme Court affirming, with modifications, the conviction of Elmer Diamante and Tanny Boy Sta. Teresa for robbery and carnapping.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Petitioners Diamante and Sta. Teresa were charged with robbery (Art. 293 RPC) and carnapping (R.A. 6539) for the taking of property and a vehicle from Wilfredo Cadorniga.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Cadorniga, a dentist, was robbed at gunpoint in his clinic. He was tied up while the clinic was ransacked and his car stolen.  Key witness Gerardo, an accomplice-turned-state witness, testified that he drove the perpetrators, including the petitioners, to the scene.
*   **Defense:**  Petitioners presented alibis. Diamante claimed he was at home, while Sta. Teresa claimed he was helping move Maricar's belongings, unaware of the robbery.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** RTC convicted Diamante and Sta. Teresa. CA affirmed.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals in both robbery and carnapping.  Liable for corresponding penalties.
*   Restitution of stolen items to Wilfredo Cadorniga.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Legality of Arrest:** Petitioners argued illegal arrest, but the Court ruled this issue waived due to failure to raise it before arraignment, citing *People v. Biyoc* (2007) and *People v. Hernandez* (1997).  Relevant to jurisdiction over the person.
*   **Identification:** Petitioners challenged Cadorniga's identification, arguing confusion and pressure during the robbery. The Court upheld the lower courts' findings that Cadorniga had ample opportunity to see the perpetrators, and his testimony was corroborated by Gerardo and Lintag.
*   **Gerardo's Testimony:** Challenge to the credibility of Gerardo's testimony as an accomplice. The Court found his testimony credible and corroborated by other evidence.
*    **Conspiracy:** Finding of conspiracy. Acts of one conspirator bind all.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Waiver of Illegal Arrest:**  *People v. Biyoc*, G.R. No. 167670 (2007) - Failure to object before arraignment waives challenge to legality of arrest. *People v. Hernandez, 347 Phil. 56 (1997)* - Failure to move to quash information.
*   **Factual Findings (Trial Court):**  *Castillo v. Court of Appeals*, 329 Phil. 150 (1996) - Findings of fact by trial court, when affirmed by appellate court, are binding on the Supreme Court.
*   **Testimony of Single Witness:**  *People v. Soriano*, G.R. No. 171085 (2009) - Testimony of a single, trustworthy witness is sufficient for conviction.
*   **Conspiracy:**  *People v. De Leon*, G.R. No. 179943 (2009) - Once conspiracy is proven, the act of one is the act of all conspirators.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to set minimum and maximum terms within statutory range.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Art. 293: Definition of Robbery
    *   Art. 294(5): Penalty for Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons.
*   **Republic Act No. 6539 (Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972):** Definition and penalties for carnapping. Section 14.
*   **Rules of Court:** Section 17, Rule 119 allows discharge of a state witness.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Sets rules for indeterminate sentencing in special laws.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:** None evident. The court's reasoning appears sound and adequately supported by existing law and jurisprudence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the convictions, modifying only the penalties to comply with applicable jurisprudence regarding the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The key weaknesses for the petitioners were their waived objection to the legality of their arrest, and the corroborated testimony of Cadorniga and the accomplice-turned-witness. The ruling hinges heavily on factual findings by the lower courts, which were not overturned by the Supreme Court.
