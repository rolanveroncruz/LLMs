## Legal Document Summary: *Uy v. Judge Lorredo* (A.M. No. MTJ-24-023)

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines in an administrative case against Presiding Judge Jorge Emmanuel M. Lorredo of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 26, Manila.

**Key Issue:** Whether Judge Lorredo is administratively liable for partiality, conduct unbecoming a judge, and irregularity in the performance of his official duties, primarily due to his conduct during a criminal case hearing.

**Decision:** Judge Lorredo is found *GUILTY* of unbecoming conduct and *DISMISSED* from service.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Violation of New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judge Lorredo violated Canon 2 (Integrity), Canon 3 (Impartiality), Canon 4 (Propriety), Canon 5 (Equality), and Canon 6 (Competence and Diligence) of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary. Specifically, his language towards witnesses and opposing counsel exhibited bias, impropriety, and lack of decorum.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and a fine of PHP 175,000.00 (PHP 35,000.00 for each of the five counts of unbecoming conduct).
*   **Payment of Fines:** The fine must be paid within three months of the decision's promulgation. Unpaid fines may be deducted from salaries, benefits, and accrued leave credits.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Lorredo is liable for the administrative offense of unbecoming conduct.
*   He is financially liable for the PHP 175,000.00 fine.
*   He is professionally liable through dismissal and perpetual disqualification.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal:** While unlikely to succeed given the Supreme Court's determination, Judge Lorredo could potentially seek reconsideration or appeal.
*   **Enforcement of Fine:** The Court will likely encounter little trouble enforcing the fine; However, it may have some trouble if Lorredo does not have adequate resources (particularly if he has no other income/assets to draw from.)

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Underlies the entire decision, providing the ethical standards for judges.
*   **Rule 140, Section 16(a) (amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC):** Governs sanctions for light charges, including unbecoming conduct.
*   ***De la Cruz v. Judge Carretas*, 559 Phil. 5 (2007):** Emphasizes the need for judges to be temperate in language and avoid humiliating lawyers, litigants, or witnesses.
*   ***Atty. Magno v. Judge Lorredo*, 817 Phil. 309 (2017):** Previous administrative case where Judge Lorredo was found guilty of unbecoming conduct and fined.
*   ***Espejon v. Judge Lorredo*, A.M. No. MTJ-22-007 (2022):** Another previous administrative case where Judge Lorredo was found liable for simple misconduct, sexual harassment, and unbecoming conduct.
*   ***Judge Larida v. Atty. Calma*, 918-A Phil. 1 (2021) & *Re: Jose S. Jacinto*, 902 Phil. 504 (2021):** Recent cases illustrating the Supreme Court's willingness to dismiss judges for repeated misconduct.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision indicates that the penalty of "forfeiture of all retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits" does *not* extend to cover deductions for unpaid fines levied against those accrued leave credits.
*   While not explicitly contentious, the fact that this is the *fourth* administrative case against Judge Lorredo, with prior warnings, suspensions, and fines, makes the dismissal a predictable but severe consequence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court, emphasizing the need to maintain judicial integrity and public confidence, dismissed Judge Lorredo due to his repeated use of inappropriate language and conduct unbecoming a judge. The decision highlights the Court's commitment to upholding the standards of the New Code of Judicial Conduct and its willingness to impose severe penalties on judges who fail to meet those standards. The multiple prior offenses and warnings significantly influenced the Court's decision to dismiss Judge Lorredo. The PHP 175,000.00 fine further underscores the gravity of the offense.
