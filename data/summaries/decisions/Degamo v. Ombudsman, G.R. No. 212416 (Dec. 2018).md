Okay, here's a concise summary of the legal document, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Degamo v. Office of the Ombudsman and Relampagos* G.R. No. 212416 (Dec. 5, 2018).

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Ombudsman's dismissal of a complaint for Usurpation of Authority/Official Functions.

**Facts:**  Governor Degamo filed a complaint against DBM Undersecretary Relampagos for withdrawing a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) for calamity funds allocated to Negros Oriental. The withdrawal was based on a request from the DPWH Secretary to delay release pending assessment of LGU capacity to implement the projects. Relampagos acted "By Authority of the Secretary" (of DBM, Abad) and as per Abad's instructions, following President Aquino's directive to enforce GAA provisions regarding LGU capacity. Degamo argued that Relampagos usurped the authority of the President/Executive Secretary.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the Petition, affirming the Ombudsman's finding of no probable cause for Usurpation.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Usurpation of Authority (Art. 177 RPC):** Court found that Relampagos did not falsely represent himself; he signed in his official capacity as Undersecretary. Cites *Gigantoni y Javier v. People* (245 Phil. 133 (1988)), requiring malicious misrepresentation.
*   **Usurpation of Official Functions (Art. 177 RPC):**
    *   **Elements:** (1) act pertaining to a public officer, (2) pretense of official position, (3) lack of lawful entitlement.
    *   Court held Relampagos acted within his authority delegated by Secretary Abad (per Dept. Order 2011-11), and Abad was acting on the instructions of the President.
    *   **Doctrine of Qualified Political Agency:** Allows Department Secretaries to act for the President. (Citing *Joson v. Torres*, 352 Phil. 888 (1998))
    *   **Good Faith:** Court found Relampagos acted in good faith.  Cites *Ruzol v. Sandiganbayan* (709 Phil. 708 (2013)) and *People v. Hilvano* (99 Phil. 655 (1956)) which notes that Good faith is a defense in criminal prosecutions for usurpation of official functions.
*   **Ombudsman Discretion:** The Court reiterated its policy of non-interference with the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause, absent grave abuse of discretion. (Citing *Dichaves v. Office of the Ombudsman*, 802 Phil. 564 (2016))

**Statutory References:**

*   Art. 177, Revised Penal Code (Usurpation of Authority/Official Functions)
*   Republic Act No. 10121 (Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010)
*   Republic Act No. 10155 (General Appropriations Act of 2012)
*   Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989)
*   Republic Act No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees)
*   Administrative Code of 1987, Section 38

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Delegation of Authority:** The case hinges on the validity and scope of delegation from the President to the DBM Secretary, and then from the Secretary to the Undersecretary.  Further scrutiny of the President's directive and Dept. Order 2011-11 is warranted to confirm the chain of command.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by Ombudsman:**  While the Court deferred to the Ombudsman, arguments could be made (though unsuccessful here) that the Ombudsman's assessment of the evidence was flawed, potentially rising to the level of grave abuse of discretion considering the withdrawal of funds already allocated for disaster relief.
*   **Interpretation of "By Authority of the Secretary":** The Court gave significant weight to this phrase.  Whether it sufficiently shields Relampagos from liability may be debatable in different factual contexts.
*   The decision is very deferential to the Ombudsman and to the President's authority, which arguably gives broad power to those agencies.

This summary focuses on the key legal points and potential issues, but further research and analysis of the cited case law and statutory provisions are essential for a complete understanding.
