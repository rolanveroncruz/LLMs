## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 218269

**Case Name:** _Suprema T. Dumo v. Republic of the Philippines_

**Court & Date:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, June 6, 2018

**Nature of Document:**  Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which partially reversed a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Joint Decision in an Accion Reivindicatoria (Civil Case No. 1301-Bg) and a Land Registration case (LRC Case No. 270-Bg).

**Key Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Suprema T. Dumo (Applicant for land registration and Defendant in the Accion Reivindicatoria)
*   **Respondent:** Republic of the Philippines
*   **Heirs of Marcelino Espinas:** Plaintiffs in the Accion Reivindicatoria, Oppositors to Land Registration

**Subject Matter:**  Dispute over ownership and possession of a parcel of land (the "Subject Property") located in Paringao, Bauang, La Union. Dumo sought to register the land, while the Heirs of Espinas claimed ownership and sought recovery of possession.

**RTC Decision:**
*   Dismissed Dumo's land registration application (LRC Case No. 270-Bg) for lack of registerable title.
*   Declared the Heirs of Espinas as owners of the Subject Property (Civil Case No. 1301-Bg) and ordered Dumo to restore ownership and possession to them.

**CA Decision:**
*   Affirmed the dismissal of Dumo's land registration application.
*   Modified the RTC decision by dismissing the Accion Reivindicatoria filed by the Heirs of Espinas for lack of cause of action, finding that they failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the land since June 12, 1945, or earlier.

**Supreme Court Decision:**
*   Denied Dumo's petition and affirmed the CA decision. The Court held that Dumo failed to prove her right to register the land under Section 14(1) or Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (PD 1529).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Section 14(1) PD 1529 (Judicial Confirmation of Imperfect Title):** Requires proof of:
    *   Land is alienable and disposable.
    *   Open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation by the applicant and predecessors-in-interest under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.
*   **Section 14(2) PD 1529 (Acquisitive Prescription):** Requires proof of:
    *   Acquisition of ownership of private lands by prescription under existing laws (Civil Code).  This requires that the land be patrimonial (no longer intended for public use, public service or the development of national wealth).
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141 (CA 141, Public Land Act):** Governs the classification and disposition of public lands. Section 6 delegates authority to the President to classify lands as alienable or disposable.  Section 48(b) outlines requirements for judicial confirmation.
*   **Proof of Alienability & Disposability:** The Court requires submission of two documents:
    *   Copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary (or the President) certified as a true copy by the legal custodian of the official records.
    *   Certificate of land classification status issued by the CENRO or PENRO of the DENR based on the approved land classification by the DENR Secretary.

**Liabilities:**
*   Dumo was liable to lose the land registration application.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **Failure to Establish Alienability:**  A key risk identified in the decision is the applicant's burden to prove, with clear and incontrovertible evidence, that the land is alienable and disposable at the time of the application. Mere certification from CENRO or PENRO is insufficient without the DENR Secretary's approval.
*   **Failure to Establish Patrimonial Status for Prescription:** For claiming ownership via prescription per Sec 14(2), it is essential to present evidence that the land has been expressly declared as patrimonial property by the State.
*   **Incorrect Legal Theory:** Dumo's arguments regarding "substantial compliance" and misinterpretation of _Republic v. Court of Appeals_ regarding the significance of June 12, 1945, were rejected, demonstrating the need for a sound legal basis for the application.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Sections 14(1) and 14(2) are central to the decision.
*   **CA 141 (Public Land Act):** Sections 6 and 48(b) are cited.
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Articles regarding property of public dominion (Art. 420), patrimonial property (Arts. 421, 422), and prescription (Art. 1113).
*   **Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc., 578 Phil. 441 (2008):**  Establishes the requirements for proving alienability and disposability.
*   **Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic of the Philippines, 605 Phil. 244 (2009):** Clarifies the requirements for registration based on prescription.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, 489 Phil. 405 (2005):** Interprets the phrase "June 12, 1945, or earlier" in Sec. 14(1) PD 1529.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 705 (Revised Forestry Code of the Philippines):** Relevant for the delegation of power to the DENR Secretary to classify forest lands as alienable and disposable under Section 13.
*   **Revised Administrative Code of 1917:** Sections 64 and 1827 are discussed in relation to historical powers of land classification.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132:** Discussed regarding admissibility of public documents.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   The main area of contention centers on the evidentiary requirements to prove that a land is alienable and disposable, and the evidence needed to prove that the state abandoned any intent to reserve the property for a public purpose.

**Overall Assessment:** Dumo's land registration application failed primarily due to her inability to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that the land was classified as alienable and disposable by the appropriate authorities and to prove adverse possession under the strict requirements of Philippine law. The Supreme Court emphasized the burden on the applicant to overcome the presumption of state ownership and meet the stringent evidentiary standards set forth in existing jurisprudence. A lawyer representing a similar applicant should ensure meticulous gathering and presentation of evidence pertaining to land classification and possession.
