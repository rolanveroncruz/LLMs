## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Ver Reyes vs. Salvador, Sr., et al.* (G.R. No. 139047) & *Cristobal and Dulos Realty vs. Salvador, Sr., et al.* (G.R. No. 139365)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 35688, which reversed the RTC decision in consolidated cases of LRC Case No. LP-553-P (land registration) and Civil Case No. 6914-P (declaration of ownership).

**Issue:** Which party acquired valid and registrable title to the subject property (Lot 1 of Plan Psu-205035) given multiple conveyances by the original owner, Nicomedes Lozada, and his heirs?

**Key Provisions & Contracts:**

*   **Deed of Conditional Sale (Nicomedes to Emma Ver Reyes, 1965):** Subject to payment schedule, with automatic nullification upon failure to pay and right of Nicomedes to resell, returning amounts paid (without interest) to Emma. Registered under Act No. 3344.
*   **Agreement of Purchase and Sale (Nicomedes to Rosario Bondoc, 1968):** Nicomedes agrees to sell rights, interests, title, and ownership upon Rosario's payment. Cancellation clause upon non-payment, with improvements accruing to Nicomedes. Registered under Act No. 3344.
*   **Joint Affidavit (Nicomedes and Rosario, 1969):** Confirms the sale of the subject property of Nicomedes to Rosario.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land (Nicomedes to Maria Cristobal, 1969):** Sale of a 2,000 sqm portion of the subject property. Registered post-Nicomedes's death.
*   **Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement (Heirs of Nicomedes, 1979):** Ratifies the sale to Maria Cristobal, clarifies the area as 2,287 square meters and claims ownership to the balance.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land (Heirs of Nicomedes to Dulos Realty, 1980):** Sale of remaining shares in the subject property to Dulos Realty. Not registered.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC decision, holding that:

*   The **Deed of Conditional Sale (Emma Reyes) and the Agreement of Purchase and Sale (Rosario Bondoc) are both contracts to sell, not contracts of sale.** Ownership remained with Nicomedes Lozada until full payment, which never occurred in either instance. Cites *Coronel v. Court of Appeals*, 331 Phil. 294 (1996) for the distinction between the two.
*   Due to the unfulfilled conditions of the contracts to sell, Nicomedes Lozada could validly convey the property to other buyers.
*   The **Deeds of Absolute Sale to Maria Cristobal and Dulos Realty validly transferred title** because the considerations were fully paid, and no further conditions for the transmission of ownership were stipulated.
*   Rosario's registration under Act No. 3344 does not confer superior right because Act No. 3344 is "without prejudice to a third party who has a better right" (Section 194 of the Administrative Code). Maria and Dulos Realty acquired a better right through the execution of the deeds of sale and the passing of ownership.
*   Emma and Rosario retain the right to sue the estate of Nicomedes for damages.

**Obligations:**

*   **Nicomedes's Estate:** Potentially liable for damages to Emma Ver Reyes and Rosario Bondoc.
*   **Rosario Bondoc:** Upon the issuance of the title to the subject property, Rosario D. Bondoc is ordered to pay the balance of the purchase price to the heirs of Nicomedes Lozada in accordance with the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.
*   **Maria Cristobal and Dulos Realty:** Ordered to respect the titles of Nicomedes's estate in subject property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Nicomedes's Estate:** Potential liability for breach of contracts to sell.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Litigation:** Further claims against the estate of Nicomedes Lozada by Emma Ver Reyes and Rosario Bondoc.
