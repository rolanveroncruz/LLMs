**Case Summary: *Litonjua v. Marcelino*, A.M. No. P-18-3865**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff Jerry R. Marcelino for dishonesty and dereliction of duty.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complaint:** Antonio Litonjua (Fruehauf Electronics Phil. Corp.) alleged Sheriff Marcelino demanded and received P100,000 in sheriff's fees (P50,000 on May 13, 2005, and P50,000 on July 14, 2005) without issuing official receipts or remitting funds to the Clerk of Court, in relation to the execution of a judgment in Civil Case No. 10652 (ejectment case).
*   **Marcelino's Defense:** Admitted receiving P50,000 (July 14 voucher) claiming it was a "token of appreciation" from Fruehauf's lawyer/Antonio's son, Benedict Litonjua, for satisfactory service, and denied receiving the other P50,000.
*   **OCA Findings:** Marcelino guilty of dishonesty and dereliction of duty.  Recommends dismissal.

**Obligations Breached & Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Rule 141, Section 10, Rules of Court:** Marcelino failed to adhere to the prescribed procedures for estimating, collecting, and handling sheriff's expenses. He received voluntary payments directly, failed to remit them to the Clerk of Court, and failed to provide proper liquidation.
*   **Dishonesty:** Appropriation of funds without proper remittance constitutes misappropriation and dishonesty.
*   **Dereliction of Duty:**  Failure to observe prescribed procedures.
*   **Breach of Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:**  Specifically, prohibitions against accepting fees beyond those officially authorized.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 10, Rules of Court:** Governing sheriff's fees and handling of expenses.
*   **Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2004:** Outlines fees liable for sheriff services.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):**  Prohibits acceptance of unauthorized fees/remuneration.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Determines appropriate penalties, especially Section 50 regarding multiple charges.
*   ***Garcia v. Alejo*** **(655 Phil. 482 (2011))**: Sheriffs cannot receive voluntary payments.
*   ***Atty. Gonzalez, et al. v. Calo*** **(685 Phil. 352, 363 (2012))**: Sheriffs are prohibited from the acceptance by sheriff's of voluntary payments from parties in the course of the performance of their duties.
*   ***Santos v. Leano, Jr.*** **(781 Phil. 342, 351 (2016))**: Any amount received in violation of Section 10, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court constitutes unauthorized fees.
*   ***Spouses Cailipan v. Casta√±eda*** **(780 Phil. 479 (2016))**: Sheriffs play an important part in the administration of justice.
*   ***Paredes v. Marcelino*** **(458 Phil. 54 (2003))**: Precedent case of the same Sheriff found guilty of abuse of authority.
*   ***Judge Marina Gaerlan Mejorada v. Jerry Marcelino*** **(A.M. No. P-15-3323)**: Another precedent case, finding him guilty of less serious dishonesty and simple neglect of duty

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **"Token of Appreciation" Defense:** Marcelino's claim that the P50,000 was a gratuity is weak and inconsistent with ongoing proceedings.  It doesn't absolve him of the obligation to remit the funds.
*   **Lack of Official Receipts:**  The absence of official receipts strengthens the claim that the funds were misappropriated.
*   **Multiple Offenses:** Marcelino's history of prior administrative offenses (abuse of authority, failure to deposit garnished money) aggravates the current charges and supports the penalty of dismissal.
*   **Risk:** The potential for Marcelino to appeal the decision, though unlikely to succeed given the weight of evidence and precedent.

**Conclusion:**

The Court's decision to dismiss Sheriff Marcelino is well-supported by the evidence and applicable law. His actions constitute serious dishonesty and dereliction of duty. His defense of "gratuitous payment" lacks credibility. Previous administrative offenses further justify the severe penalty imposed.
