**Legal Document Summary: *Apelanio v. Arcanys, Inc.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 227098, November 14, 2018 (Supreme Court of the Philippines)

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Julius Q. Apelanio (probationary employee)
*   **Respondents:** Arcanys, Inc. and CEO Alan Debonneville (Employer)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding alleged illegal dismissal of a probationary employee.

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the NLRC's decision, which found Apelanio to be a regular employee illegally dismissed. The core question is whether the employer validly terminated Apelanio's probationary employment based on failure to meet reasonable standards.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**
*   **Probationary Employment:** Apelanio hired as a Usability/Web Design Expert on a 6-month probationary status, subject to performance evaluations.
*   **Performance Evaluation:** Regular evaluations conducted (monthly), but Petitioner alleges lack of clarity on passing grade or reasonable standards. Evaluations reflected diminishing scores.
*   **Termination:** Arcanys did not convert Apelanio to regular status due to unsatisfactory performance, citing failure to meet company standards.
*   **Waiver, Release, and Quitclaim:** Apelanio signed a waiver, release, and quitclaim after receiving final pay, which normally bars claims (but the court will look into validity of these releases).
*   **Retainership Agreements:** After termination, Apelanio was offered (and allegedly accepted) retainership agreements with similar duties but lower pay and no benefits. He argues this demonstrated that Arcanys found him qualified for the position.
*   **Hacking Incident:** Arcanys experienced hacking incidents, which allegedly led them to pursue retainer agreements with Appellante, who claimed to have relevant information.
*   **Unsigned Contract:** The Supreme Court noted the lack of Apelanio's signature on the retainership agreements, finding them ineffectual and inadmissable as evidence.

**Legal Analysis & Case Law:**
*   **Probationary Employment (Art. 281 Labor Code):** Employer must inform employee of standards for regularization. *Apelanio alleges lack of clear standards* making his evaluation suspect.
*   **Reasonable Standards:** Employer must establish reasonable standards communicated to the employee during the probationary period (see jurisprudence cited in CA Decision).
*   **Management Prerogative:** Employer has the right to retain employees deemed fit, *if proper procedures were followed*. (See cases in CA decision).
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The court discusses contracts of adhesion; however, it distinguishes them from the matter at hand since there was no “adhesion” from Apelanio in the form of a signature.
*   **Quitclaim/Waiver:** *Presumption is against validity.* Courts scrutinize these for voluntariness and whether the employee fully understood the implications. *Issue:* Was the waiver valid given the subsequent retainership offers?
*   ***Philippine Commercial International Bank v. CA,* 325 Phil. 588 (1996):** Defined the standard for contracts of adhesion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Reasonable Standards of Satisfactory Performance:** Vague and potentially contentious, the standards of performance should be specified and defined in the document.
*   **Voluntariness of the Quitclaim/Waiver:** The issue of whether Apelanio signed the release voluntarily, especially considering the subsequent retainership offers, is central. Did the retainership agreements essentially negate the waiver?
*   **The true nature of the retainerships:** The claim that the retainer agreements were drafted in response to the hacking is questionable. The lack of an agreement from Apeliano to sign the contract puts their claim in jeopardy.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** If Apelanio successfully argues lack of clear probationary standards and demonstrates the waiver was invalid, Arcanys could be liable for backwages, reinstatement, and damages.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice:** (although dismissed by the LA, could be revived).
*   **Damages:** Moral and exemplary damages are possible if malice or bad faith is proven.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with the employer, asserting that it has validly terminated Apelanio. Apelanio should have signed the retainer agreement if that was his intention.
