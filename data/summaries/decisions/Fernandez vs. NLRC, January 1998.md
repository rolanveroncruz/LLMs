**Case Summary: *Leiden Fernandez, et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.* G.R. No. 105892, January 28, 1998**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing NLRC decision vacating Labor Arbiter's award to petitioners and remanding the case.

**Key Issues & Rulings:**

1.  **Sufficiency of Appeal Bond:** The Supreme Court affirmed that the appeal bond posted by the employer was sufficient.  The Court clarified that NLRC Rule VI, Section 6, which excludes moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees from the computation of the appeal bond, is valid and consistent with Article 223 of the Labor Code. This rule is a contemporaneous construction of Article 223 by the NLRC. Relevant Case Law: *Erectors vs. NLRC, 202 SCRA 597*. *Diola vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 222 SCRA 860*.
2.  **Denial of Due Process:** The NLRC's decision to remand the case due to perceived denial of due process to the employer was deemed a grave abuse of discretion. The Court held that the filing of position papers and supporting documents by both parties satisfied the requirements of due process. The employer's failure to attend hearings without valid justification constituted a waiver of the right to present further evidence. The Court emphasized that it had the duty to determine the validity of the allegations of the parties because to remand it to the labor arbiter is to delay needlessly the disposition of this case. The essence of due process is the opportunity to be heard.
3.  **Illegal Dismissal vs. Abandonment:** The Court ruled that nine of the petitioners (Leiden Fernandez, Brenda Gadiano, Gloria Adriano, Emelia Negapatan, Jesus Tomongha, Eleonor Quiñanola, Asteria Campo, Florida Villaceran and Florida Talledo) were illegally dismissed, rejecting the employer's claim of abandonment. The court stated that the claim of abandonment was inconsistent with the immediate filing of petitioners’ complaint for illegal dismissal and prayer for reinstatement. For how can an inference be made that an employee had no intention of returning to work, when he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal praying for reinstatement three days after the alleged abandonment? *Relevant Case Law: Jackson Building Condominium Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 246 SCRA 329, 332, July 14, 1995*. The Court emphasized that the employer failed to prove intention to abandon and overt acts supporting such intent. *Relevant Case Law: Kingsize Manufacturing Corp. vs. NLRC, 238 SCRA 349, November 24, 1994*.
    *   However, petitioners Marilyn Lim and Joseph Canonigo were found to have voluntarily resigned.
4.  **Monetary Awards:**
    *   **Backwages:** The Court ordered *full backwages* without deduction of earnings elsewhere, consistent with RA 6715. (Bustamante et al. vs. NLRC et al.* G.R. No. 111651). This is to be computed from the date of illegal dismissal to actual reinstatement.
    *   **Service Incentive Leave Pay:** The Court ruled that the service incentive leave pay should be computed from December 16, 1975 (the date the amendatory provision of the Labor Code took effect) up to the date of actual reinstatement, rejecting the limitation of three years based on the prescription period for money claims.
    *   **Damages and Attorney's Fees:** The award of moral damages and attorney's fees, as determined by the labor arbiter, was deemed proper due to the oppressive and bad faith manner of the dismissals.
*   **Statutory References:**
    *   Article 223 of the Labor Code
    *   Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by RA 6715 (Security of Tenure)
    *   Article 291 of the Labor Code (Money Claims)
    *   NLRC Rules of Procedure, Rule VI, Section 6; Rule V, Section 11.

**Disposition:**

The Court *GRANTED* the petition. The NLRC Decision and Resolution were *REVERSED and SET ASIDE*.  The Labor Arbiter's decision was *REINSTATED with MODIFICATIONS* regarding service incentive leave pay calculation and full backwages. Lim and Canonigo were denied any benefits.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Reinstatement Feasibility:** The order for reinstatement may be impractical or impossible if the positions no longer exist or the business has significantly changed.
*   **Computation of Backwages:** The "actual reinstatement" date could be a point of contention if the employer delays or refuses to reinstate properly.
*   **Good faith of Employer:** If there were proof that the business would experience significant financial hardship, this may have served as a justification to reduce the full backwages required.
*   **Voluntary resignation:** Marilyn Lim and Joseph Canonigo were not entitled to any benefits since they voluntarily resigned. However, the fact that the petition for review was granted may serve to imply a decision that was otherwise.
