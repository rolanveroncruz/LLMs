Here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case Name:** *National Power Corporation vs. Premier Shipping Lines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 179103 & 180209, September 17, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision which partially reversed the RTC decision in a breach of contract case.  Premier sued NAPOCOR for additional expenses incurred in a hauling contract.

**Background:**

*   NAPOCOR awarded Premier a contract (Job Order No. ADM-TWSS-96-03-28, signed 2 August 1996) to haul 924 wood poles from Bacolod to various locations. The price was a "lot price" of P2,398,000.00.
*   A supplemental contract was executed due to a change in the delivery point in Mindoro, with NAPOCOR agreeing to pay an additional P65,000 for fuel and lube oil.
*   Premier claims additional costs due to:
    *   Segregation of unserviceable poles at the origin (Bacolod).
    *   Increased distance from the pier to the stockyard in San Jose, Mindoro, and clearing of the stockyard.
*   NAPOCOR withheld P23,150.25 for alleged shortage in delivery (45 poles).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Scope of Work (Article II):** The main dispute centers on the interpretation of "segregation of delivered items at the designated stockyards."  Premier argues this limits segregation to *delivery* locations. NAPOCOR contends it includes the *origin* stockyard.  The Court held that the wood poles, when delivered at the points of destination, should have already been segregated as specified in the contract and that Premier may choose where it wanted to perform the segregation of the poles, whether it be at the port of origin or at the port of destination.
2.  **Supplemental Contract:**  The Supplemental Contract, covering a change in the Mindoro delivery point and an additional P65,000 payment, becomes crucial. NAPOCOR argues this payment covers *all* costs related to the change. The court sides with this argument stating that no particular point in any of the destination points was mentioned in the contract.
3.  **"Lot Price":** The "lot price" designation of the contract is key to the ruling on the withheld amount.

**Court Holdings:**

*   **Segregation Costs:**  Premier is **not** entitled to additional compensation for the segregation work at the point of origin because it was part of the original contract. The court reasoned that the phrase "segregation of the delivered items at the designated stockyards" simply refers to the requirement that the wood poles, upon delivery, should already have been segregated.
*   **Distance & Clearing Costs:** Premier is **not** entitled to additional payment for the extra distance in San Jose, Mindoro.  Court reasons that the contract provided for the payment of P65,000.00 for the additional fuel and lube oil necessitated by the change in the delivery point, and as such, no further compensation may be claimed.
*   **Withheld Amount:** NAPOCOR must pay the withheld P23,150.25, as the failure to deliver all poles was not Premier's fault (NAPOCOR instructed them not to load the unserviceable poles).
*   **Attorney's Fees & Costs:** The award of attorney's fees and litigation costs to Premier is affirmed.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Designated Stockyards":** The lack of a clear definition of "designated stockyards" in the original contract allowed the Court to interpret it broadly.
*   **Integration Clause & Supplemental Contract:**  The court implicitly treats the Supplemental Contract as fully integrated, barring Premier from claiming additional compensation for matters that could have been addressed at that time (related to changed delivery locations).
*   **Contractor's Due Diligence:** The decision emphasizes the contractor's responsibility to conduct due diligence and anticipate potential costs, especially in light of its prior dealings with NAPOCOR.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 88** (re: interest rates)
*   **Perez vs. Pomar, 2 Phil. 682** (Cited by RTC but deemed inapplicable by CA due to the existence of an express contract)
*   **Article 2142 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines.** (Principle of unjust enrichment â€“ deemed inapplicable due to the contract)
*   **Meralco Industrial Engineering Services Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 145402, 14 March 2008, 548 SCRA 315, 334** (Contract is the law between the parties.)
*   **Vda. de Jayme v. Court of Appeals, 439 Phil. 192, 209 (2002).** (Courts cannot relieve parties from bad bargains.)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, denying Premier's claims for additional compensation. The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the terms of the contract and the contractor's responsibility to conduct due diligence. The key takeaway is the narrow interpretation given to Premier's entitlement to additional compensation beyond the terms of the original and supplemental agreements.
