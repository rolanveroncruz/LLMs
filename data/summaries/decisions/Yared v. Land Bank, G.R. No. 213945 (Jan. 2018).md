## Legal Document Summary: Yared v. Land Bank

**Case:** *Lucila Yared and Heirs of Ernesto Yared, Sr. v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 213945, January 24, 2018 (824 Phil. 487).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision regarding just compensation for land acquired under RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Property:** 134.895 hectares in Bais City, Negros Oriental, covered by TCT No. ST-27.
*   **CARP Coverage:** Land placed under CARP in 1996.
*   **Initial Valuation:** Land Bank initially valued the property at P7,067,426.91.
*   **DARAB Proceedings:** Petitioners challenged the valuation before DARAB (DARAB Case No. JC-RVII-NEG-22-CO). DARAB initially directed LBP to recompute, LBP submitted a reevaluation of P11,366,366.15, but DARAB ultimately reverted to the initial valuation.
*   **RTC (SAC) Proceedings:** Petition for Determination of Just Compensation filed before the RTC sitting as Special Agrarian Court (SAC). RTC recomputed valuation and directed Land Bank to pay the remaining balance plus legal interest, attorney's fees, exemplary damages, and commissioner's fees. RTC used formula LV = [CNI x 0.9] + [MV x 0.1].
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed RTC's valuation method but deleted the award of legal interest, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **SC Ruling:** Granted the Petition and reinstated the legal interest. SC cited *Apo Fruits Corporation, et al. v. Land Bank of the Philippines* (647 Phil. 251 (2010)) stating the importance of including interest where there is a delay.

**Obligations:**

*   **Land Bank's Obligation:** To pay just compensation, which includes the full and fair equivalent of the property *and* payment without delay. Includes the payment of the remaining balance of P11,537,478.00 and the interest payments.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Interest:** Land Bank is liable for legal interest on the unpaid balance of P11,537,478.00. Rate is 12% per annum from September 25, 1996 (date of taking) until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment, as per BSP-MB Circular No. 799 (affirmed in *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013)).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Accrual of Interest:** The longer the delay in payment, the higher the accrued interest, increasing Land Bank's liability.
*   **Precedent:** The ruling strengthens the precedent that landowners are entitled to interest in expropriation cases when there is a delay in payment, even if there was an initial deposit.
*   **Lack of Timely Information:** Court noted the bank's disregard of other mandatory factors in the computation of just compensation due to lack of earnest efforts in ensuring the procurement of the necessary data.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program):** Governs the land acquisition process.
*   **Section 17 of RA 6657:** Valuation Formula
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 1992:** Governs initial valuation methods.
*   ***Republic of the Philippines, et al. v. Judge Mupas, et al.*, G.R. No. 181892, April 19, 2016** - definition of just compensation.
*   ***Apo Fruits Corporation, et al. v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, 647 Phil. 251 (2010):** Establishes the right to interest when property is taken before compensation is deposited.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Affirmed BSP-MB Circular No. 799 changing the legal interest rates.
*   ***Land Bank v. Kho*, G.R. 214901, June 15, 2016:** Guideline in the award of interest in expropriation cases in line with the amended interest rate.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of what constitutes "delay" in the context of just compensation is inherently fact-dependent. The Court relied heavily on the extended DARAB proceedings and Land Bank's initial valuation discrepancies to justify the imposition of interest.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court favored the landowners, emphasizing the importance of prompt payment in expropriation cases and establishing Land Bank's liability for legal interest due to the protracted valuation and payment process. The case highlights the need for government agencies to expedite just compensation payments to avoid further financial burdens.
