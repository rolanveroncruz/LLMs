## Legal Document Summary - *Campos v. Pastrana*, G.R. No. 175994 (2009)

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision declaring Deeds of Absolute Sale as null and void due to being absolutely simulated transactions, designed to evade judgment execution in a prior possession case.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Issue:** Validity of Deeds of Absolute Sale from spouses Campos (judgment debtors) to their children (petitioners) executed while a possession case was pending against them.
*   **CA Holding:** The CA reversed the RTC and ruled the Deeds of Absolute Sale were absolutely simulated (void ab initio) under **Article 1409 of the Civil Code**, not merely rescissible under Article 1381(3). The appellate court ordered cancellation of the titles registered in the petitioners' names and restoration of the titles to the parents' names.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. The deeds were deemed simulated based on several factors:
    *   Delayed registration suggesting antedating of the Deeds of Absolute Sale and lack of Notarial commision
    *   Gross inadequacy of the stated consideration compared to the properties' zonal valuation.
    *   Continued possession and control of the properties by the parents despite the purported sales.
    *   The issuance of titles to the children did not create ownership as the Torrens system confirms not creates ownership.

**Obligations:**

*   The *Register of Deeds* is obligated to cancel the titles of the children (petitioners) and restore them to the parents (Carlito Campos).
*   Petitioners are obligated to relinquish any claim to the properties based on the invalidated Deeds of Absolute Sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for the costs of the suit.
*   Spouses Campos remain liable for the unsatisfied judgment in the Possession Case (Civil Case No. V-5417) and these properties may now be subject to levy.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Enforcement:** The respondents can now pursue execution against these properties to satisfy the judgment in the Possession Case.
*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** While the current decision directly addresses the title of the properties, other potential creditors of the parents could initiate similar actions if they believe assets were fraudulently transferred to avoid debt repayment.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1409 of the Civil Code:**  Governs void and inexistent contracts, particularly those absolutely simulated.
*   **Article 1381(3) of the Civil Code:** Governs rescissible contracts, specifically those undertaken in fraud of creditors. The court found this provision inapplicable as there was no contract in the first place.
*   ***Suntay v. Court of Appeals*** **321 Phil. 809 (1995)** and ***Spouses Santiago v. Court of Appeals***, **343 Phil. 612 (1997)** These cases are cited to support the finding that the parents continued possession of property after an alleged sale is a badge of fraud, supporting a finding of simulation.
*   ***Onglengco v. Ozaeta***, **70 Phil 43, 47 (1940)** and ***Perez v. Court of Appeals***, **380 Phil. 592, 602 (2000)** These cases are cited to support that the civil code provisions on rescission are not applicable as contracts that are null and void are not subjects to rescission.
*   **Article 1410 of the Civil Code:** States that the action for declaration of inexistence of a contract is imprescriptible.
*   **Torrens System** Does not create or vest titles. It only confirms and records existing title already vested and cannot be used to shield commission of fraud.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** This governs the requirements for this type of appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The discrepancy between the dates of execution and registration of the Deeds of Absolute Sale was a point of contention. The court inferred that the deeds were backdated to avoid attachment by creditors, but it could be argued other reasons existed for the delay in registration.
*   The determination of the consideration's inadequacy is somewhat subjective, as market value can fluctuate. However, the gross disparity combined with other badges of fraud supported the court's conclusion.

**Legal Precision:**

The court's decision hinges on the finding of *absolute simulation*, which renders the contracts void *ab initio* (from the beginning). This is distinct from a *rescissible* contract, which is valid until rescinded. The action for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract is imprescriptible.
