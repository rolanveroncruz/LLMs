## Legal Document Summary: Litonjua v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 120294, February 10, 1998)

**Case:** *Antonio Litonjua and Arnold Litonjua v. Court of Appeals, et al.*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Issue:**  Whether Wack Wack Golf and Country Club validly suspended Antonio Litonjua (Associate Member) and his son Arnold Litonjua (Junior Member) for violating club by-laws related to delinquent members availing of club privileges.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, affirming the validity of the suspension.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Club By-Laws (Sec. 34(a) & (d)):** Establishes procedure for billing members, posting delinquent members, and imposing automatic 60-day suspension for delinquent members using club privileges. Critical for determining the legality of the suspension.
*   **Delinquency Posting:** Antonio Litonjua was posted as delinquent for non-payment of November 1984 dues.
*   **Disputed Delivery:** Litonjua claimed non-receipt of the November 1984 statement of account. Wack Wack presented evidence of delivery to his office, received by an employee ("Aquino").
*   **Misrepresentation:** Litonjua convinced club staff to remove his name from the delinquent list by claiming non-receipt and presenting a sealed envelope (later found to contain the *December* statement).
*   **Continued Use of Facilities:** Litonjua used club facilities while technically listed as delinquent (later found to be based on misrepresentation).
*   **60-Day Suspension:** Wack Wack imposed a 60-day suspension based on Sec. 34(d). This suspension also affected his son, Arnold.
*   **Junior Membership:** Arnold Litonjua's membership as a Junior Member is dependent on his father's good standing, per Section 6(f) of the By-Laws.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Litonjua's Obligation:** To pay club dues timely and to refrain from using club privileges while delinquent. He is liable for following the club's bylaws.
*   **Wack Wack's Obligation:** To properly bill members and to administer club rules fairly.
*   **Liability for Damages:** Initially, the SEC awarded damages to the Litonjuas. This was overturned by the CA and SC due to the finding that the suspension was lawful.
*   **Members of Board of Directors & Membership Committee:** Initially included as party respondents, ordered by SEC to pay damages. This was overturned by the CA and SC

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute on Delivery:** The key factual dispute centered on whether the November 1984 statement of account was delivered. Resolution hinges on the credibility of witness testimony and the interpretation of circumstantial evidence.  The SC gave weight to the CA's assessment of the messenger's testimony.
*   **Delegation of Authority:** The auxiliary clerks' practice of deleting names from the delinquent list without formal approval could have been a point of contention, *if* the deletion had not been based on misrepresentation. The Court considered that immaterial because of the finding that the deletion was procured by false pretenses.
*   **Interpretation of "Good Standing":** While the By-Laws state that junior membership depends on a parent's good standing, the extent of that dependency could be argued. The SC adopted a logical interpretation that suspension of the parent necessitates suspension of the junior member.
*   **Application of Sec. 34(d) Strict Construction:** Litonjua initially argued that he was no longer on the delinquent list when he used the club facilities (due to the clerical error). The court rejected this argument, holding that the deletion was procured by false pretenses. The court implied that bylaws should not be strictly construed to frustrate their purpose (preventing delinquent members from using club privileges).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Datu Tagoranao v. SEC (123 SCRA 72 (1983)):**  Cited for the principle that courts generally defer to the factual findings of administrative bodies, *unless* there is grave abuse of discretion or lack of substantial evidence.
*   **Tabaco v. CA (239 SCRA 485 (1994)):** Allows reversal of trial court (here, SEC) factual findings by the CA if errors are apparent.
*   **Trans-Pacific Industrial Supplies, Inc. v. CA (235 SCRA 494 (1994)):** Burden of proof lies with the party alleging a fact.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sec. 34(d):** The automatic suspension clause was heavily debated regarding its applicability given the initial deletion of Litonjua's name from the delinquent list and the subsequent suspension of his son.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case turns on a factual determination of whether Litonjua misrepresented facts to have his name removed from the delinquent list. The Supreme Court deferred to the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the evidence and upheld the validity of the suspension based on his violation of the club's by-laws, as well as his son's dependance of his membership to his. This establishes that any deletion procured under false representation is invalid.
