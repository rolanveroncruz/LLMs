**Case:** *Banco de Oro-EPCI, Inc. v. JAPRL Development Corporation, Rapid Forming Corporation and Jose U. Arollado*, G.R. No. 179901 (2008)

**Summary:**

Banco de Oro-EPCI (BDO) extended credit facilities to JAPRL Development Corporation (JAPRL), with Rapid Forming Corporation (RFC) and Jose U. Arollado acting as sureties. BDO alleges JAPRL falsified financial statements to secure the loan. JAPRL defaulted on trust receipt payments, prompting BDO to file a collection suit with a preliminary attachment application in Makati RTC. After this was denied, JAPRL and RFC filed a rehabilitation petition in Quezon City RTC, resulting in a stay order which was subsequently denied, and then in Calamba RTC, resulting in another stay order. The issue revolves around the validity of service of summons in the Makati RTC case, the propriety of suspending proceedings against Arollado, and the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation by JAPRL.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Trust Receipt Agreement:** Paragraph 16 outlines Events of Default, including incorrect representations by the Entrustee (JAPRL). BDO invoked this to demand immediate payment.
*   **Surety Agreement:** RFC and Arollado are sureties for JAPRL, potentially making them solidarily liable.
*   **General Banking Law (Sec. 40):** Empowers banks to terminate loans and demand immediate repayment if financial statements provided by borrowers are false or incorrect.
*   **Trust Receipts Law (Sec. 13):** Failure to turn over proceeds or return goods under a trust receipt constitutes estafa.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation:** Dictates stay orders deferring actions against the corporation seeking rehabilitation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **JAPRL:** Potentially liable for breach of contract under the Trust Receipt Agreement and potentially criminally liable for Estafa under Trust Receipts Law if the financial statements prove to be false.
*   **RFC & Arollado:** As sureties, they are solidarily liable for JAPRL's debt to BDO which will remain regardless of the corporate rehabilitation (pending no successful claims against BDO).
*   **Risk to BDO:** Delay in recovering funds due to ongoing rehabilitation proceedings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sec. 6 & 11:** Addresses valid service of summons on individuals and domestic corporations, respectively.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC):** Governs the stay order and rehabilitation process.
*   **Philippine Airlines v. Kurangking, 438 Phil. 375, 381 (2002):** Addresses the stay order's effect.
*   **Philippine Blooming Mills v. Court of Appeals, 459 Phil. 875, 892 (2003):** Addresses the solidary liability of sureties.
*   **General Banking Law (various sections):** Regarding Bank Regulations

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Service of Summons:** The CA initially found that service of summons on an administrative assistant was invalid, which the Supreme Court reversed holding that they waived that right by submitting to jurisdiction.
*   **Stay Order's Effect on Surety:** The Makati RTC initially ruled that Arollado, as surety, remained subject to suit despite the stay order on JAPRL and RFC, however he will not be held liable if JAPRL is not found liable.
*   **Fraudulent Misrepresentation:** BDO's allegation of fraudulent financial statements, if proven, would potentially lift the rehabilitation stay and allow BDO to pursue immediate repayment under the General Banking Law and Trust Agreement.

**Outcome/Holding:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, ordering the Makati RTC to proceed with the case against Arollado (and JAPRL/RFC if warranted), while highlighting that the Makati City Prosecutor should investigate probable cause for violation of the Trust Receipts Law. The court stressed the significance of a stable banking system and frowned upon procedural technicalities used to evade legitimate obligations. The Makati RTC should proceed with the trial guided by Section 40 of the General Banking Law.
