**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Jefferson Medina y Cruz* (G.R. No. 225747, December 05, 2018)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision affirming Medina's conviction for Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (shabu) under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.  The acquittal was based on a critical failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically concerning witness requirements during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Shabu) under RA 9165, Section 5, Article II.
*   **Chain of Custody - Witness Requirements:**  RA 9165, as it stood at the time (before RA 10640), required the inventory and photography of seized drugs to be conducted in the presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official.  Here, only the media representative was present.  RA 10640 (amending RA 9165) now requires an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media
*   **Saving Clause/Justifiable Grounds:**  While the IRR of RA 9165 and RA 10640 provide a "saving clause" allowing for non-compliance with procedures under "justifiable grounds" if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, the prosecution failed to provide any such justification for the absence of the DOJ representative and the elected public official.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The court reiterated the critical need to establish the identity and integrity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, as it constitutes the *corpus delicti* of the offense.  Failure to do so warrants acquittal.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:**  The prosecution bears the burden to meticulously account for each link in the chain of custody.  This includes demonstrating genuine and sufficient efforts to secure the presence of the required witnesses. Citing People v. Miranda.
*   **Accused's Liability:**  Medina was initially found guilty by the RTC and CA but was acquitted by the Supreme Court due to the prosecution's failure.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Weak Chain of Custody:** Failure to strictly adhere to chain of custody requirements, particularly the witness provisions, poses a significant risk of acquittal in drug cases.
*   **Insufficient Justification for Non-Compliance:**  Reliance on the "saving clause" without providing concrete and justifiable reasons for deviations from the procedural requirements is insufficient. The court will not presume justification. People v. De Guzman.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165, Section 21):** Amended the witness requirements for inventory and photography.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, Section 21(a):** Contains the "saving clause."
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018** - Reminder to prosecutors of the positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Mamalumpon, 767 Phil. 845, 855 (2015)** - Defined the "immediate confiscation" when it comes to marking the seized items
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637, 649 (2010)** - Court cannot presume what these justifiable grounds are or that they even exist.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "saving clause" in the IRR and RA 10640 hinges on the interpretation of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance. This often leads to litigation concerning the reasonableness of the efforts made by law enforcement to comply with the witness requirements. The Court emphasized here that mere statements of unavailability of the witnesses are not considered justifiable grounds, especially when officers are given sufficient time to prepare for a buy-bust operation
