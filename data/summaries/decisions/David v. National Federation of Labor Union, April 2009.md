**Legal Document Summary: *David v. National Federation of Labor Union and Mariveles Apparel Corporation***

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 148263 and 148271-72

**Court:** First Division, Supreme Court

**Date:** April 21, 2009

**Key Issue:** Whether Armando David, as a corporate officer, was denied due process and validly held solidarily liable for Mariveles Apparel Corporation's (MAC) debts to its employees following its illegal closure.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that Armando David (former MAC President) was denied due process and improperly held solidarily liable for MAC's financial obligations to its employees.  The Court ruled that the Labor Arbiter (LA) lacked jurisdiction over David's person because he was impleaded in the decision itself, without prior summons or opportunity to be heard, violating his due process rights under the 1987 Constitution and the NLRC Rules of Procedure. Specifically, David wasn't summoned to preliminary conferences (Rule V, Section 2), given the opportunity to submit a position paper (Rule V, Section 3), or notified that the case was submitted for resolution.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Closure:** The Labor Arbiter found MAC guilty of illegal closure for ceasing operations without proper notice. This led to the award of separation pay and attorney's fees.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The Labor Arbiter initially held David, along with MAC and its Chairman, Antonio Carag, solidarily liable for the monetary awards. This was the primary point of contention.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential Liability for Corporate Debts:** The case initially exposed David to personal liability for MAC's debts. The initial ruling could potentially establish a precedent for holding corporate officers liable under similar circumstances. The ultimate ruling shields David from personal liability.
*   **Due Process Violations:** The primary risk was the violation of David's due process rights, which ultimately resulted in the reversal of the lower court's decisions.
*   **Impact on Corporate Officer Liability:** The case clarifies the parameters under which a corporate officer can be held personally liable for corporate debts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 212(e) of the Labor Code:** Defined "employer," but the Court clarified that this provision alone does not automatically make a corporate officer personally liable.
*   **Section 31 of the Corporation Code:** Governs the personal liability of directors, trustees, or officers, requiring proof of willful and knowing assent to unlawful acts, gross negligence, or bad faith.
*   ***Antonio C. Carag v. National Labor Relations Commission***: Relevant for similar arguments on due process violations by another officer of the same company (MAC).
*   ***St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC***: Cited regarding the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction over NLRC decisions.
*   **New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC (Rule V, Sections 2, 3, 4, 5(b), and 11(c)):** Highlighted the procedural deficiencies in impleading David.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial application of Article 212(e) of the Labor Code to impose solidary liability. The Supreme Court clarified that the Corporation Code (Section 31) provides the specific grounds for officer liability.
*   The basis for the Labor Arbiter's decision to implead David "to assure that valid claims of employees would not be defeated by the closure of [MAC]." The Supreme Court deemed this insufficient without demonstrating grounds for personal liability under Section 31 of the Corporation Code.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision underscores the importance of due process in labor cases. It emphasizes that a corporate officer cannot be held personally liable for corporate debts without a clear showing of the specific grounds for liability outlined in Section 31 of the Corporation Code and only if the NLRC has jurisdiction over that person. The court found that David was denied due process and there was no finding of bad faith, negligence or willful and knowing assent to unlawful acts.
