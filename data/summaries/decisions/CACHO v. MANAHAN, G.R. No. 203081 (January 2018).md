**Case Summary: Cacho v. Manahan, Dagupan Bus Co., Inc., and De Vera Construction (G.R. No. 203081, January 17, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC decision, which initially held the respondents jointly and severally liable for damages arising from a vehicular accident resulting in death and injuries.

**Facts:**

*   A vehicular accident occurred involving a Nissan Sentra driven by the deceased, Bismark Cacho, and a Dagupan Bus driven by Gerardo Manahan. The collision happened on a narrow highway near a bridge.
*   Petitioners (Cacho's wife and children) sued Manahan, Dagupan Bus Co. (employer), and Renato De Vera (contractor for bridge repairs).
*   Plaintiffs allege the bus swerved to avoid boulders negligently placed on the shoulder of the road by De Vera Construction, causing it to hit Cacho's car.
*   Respondents argued Cacho was speeding and swerved to avoid the rocks, hitting the bus.
*   RTC found all respondents jointly and severally liable, but CA reversed and dismissed the complaint finding Cacho negligent.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 2176 of the Civil Code:** Basis for quasi-delict, establishing liability for damages caused by fault or negligence.
*   **Article 2180 of the Civil Code:** Employer's vicarious liability for the negligent acts of its employees (Manahan's negligence imputable to Dagupan Bus). Establishes presumption of negligence on the part of the employer in the selection and/or supervision of employee, rebuttable only by showing diligence of a good father of a family (bonos paterfamilias).
*   **Article 1733 of the Civil Code:** Imposes extraordinary diligence on common carriers for the safety of passengers.
*   **Article 2185 of the Civil Code:** Presumption of negligence for traffic regulation violators.
*   **RA 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code), Section 35:** Speed restrictions and requirements for careful and prudent driving.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Manahan (Driver):** Primary liability for negligence in driving the bus, violating traffic regulations, and failing to exercise reasonable care and caution.
*   **Dagupan Bus Co. (Employer):** Vicarious liability for Manahan's negligence under Article 2180. The Supreme Court held that the bus company failed to adequately prove that it had exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employees. This included their quick clearance of Manahan despite issues identified in his records.
*   **De Vera (Construction Contractor):** Joint and several liability initially found by RTC for negligently placing boulders on the roadside, creating a dangerous condition. However, the CA did not rule on De Vera's liability because De Vera did not appeal the RTC's decision.
*   **Damages awarded by RTC (reinstated by Supreme Court with modifications):**
    *   Burial and funeral expenses (P60,000)
    *   Loss of life (P50,000)
    *   Loss of support (P2,000,000)
    *   Moral damages (P300,000)
    *   Exemplary damages (P100,000)
    *   Loss of earning capacity (P1,680,000)
    *   Attorney's fees (P200,000)
    *   Interest at 6% per annum from the date of the RTC decision (January 26, 2004) until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The primary point of contention revolves around factual determinations of negligence. The SC overturned the CA due to a divergence of factual assessments between the CA and the trial court (RTC). The SC found RTC's assessment more credible.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The CA's erroneous finding that Cacho's negligence was the proximate cause of the accident was overturned. The Supreme Court affirmed that Manahan's negligence was the proximate cause.
*   **Application of Res Ipsa Loquitur:**  While initially mentioned by the RTC, it wasn't the primary basis for the ruling. The SC focused on direct evidence of negligence.
*   **Vicarious Liability:** Establishing whether Dagupan Bus exercised due diligence in selecting and supervising Manahan is crucial. The SC found the Bus Co. failed in this respect.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The RTC's finding that all respondents are solidarity liable is key, as it means the petitioners can recover the full amount from any one of the respondents.
*   **Interest Rate:**  The Supreme Court specified the interest rate of 6% per annum from the date of the RTC decision until full payment, correcting the RTC's oversight. This represents a significant additional liability.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Picart v. Smith, 37 Phil. 809 (1918):** Establishes the "prudent man" test for negligence.
*   **Kapalaran Bus Line v. Coronado, 257 Phil. 797, 808 (1989):** Reinforces the extraordinary diligence required of common carriers.
*   **Davao Holiday Transport Services Corporation v. Spouses Emphasis, 748 Phil. 921, 925 (2014)** Cites that Employers must formulate standard operating procedures, monitor their implementation, and impose disciplinary measures for breaches thereof. These facts must be shown by concrete proof, including documentary evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision favors the petitioners. The key liability rests on Manahan's negligence as a driver and Dagupan Bus's vicarious liability as his employer, stemming from their failure to prove due diligence in employee selection and supervision. De Vera's liability, although initially found by the RTC, was not addressed by the CA. The damages and interest awarded against Manahan and Dagupan Bus represent a substantial financial obligation.
