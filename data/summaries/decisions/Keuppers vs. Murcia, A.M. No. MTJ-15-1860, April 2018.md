**Case Summary: Keuppers v. Judge Murcia (A.M. No. MTJ-15-1860)**

**Core Issue:**  Liability of a Municipal Trial Court Judge for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service by solemnizing a marriage outside his territorial jurisdiction in violation of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 7, Family Code:**  Defines who may solemnize marriage, limiting jurisdiction to incumbent members of the judiciary *within the court's jurisdiction*.
*   **Article 8, Family Code:**  Specifies the allowable venues for solemnization: judge's chambers/open court, church, etc., *and not elsewhere*, except (1) *in articulo mortis*, (2) in remote places (Art. 29), or (3) upon written, sworn request of both parties.  This case underscores the importance of the limiting phrase "and not elsewhere."
*   **Canon 6, Section 7, New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judges shall not engage in conduct incompatible with the diligent discharge of judicial duties.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Judge Murcia found GUILTY** of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.
*   The court rejected the defense of pity or urgent circumstances as justification for violating the explicit venue requirements of the Family Code.
*   The court emphasized that the office of solemnizing marriages should not be treated casually and reiterated that it must be governed by the laws and traditions of the Philippines
*   The court held that Respondent Judge willfully intended to violate the Family Code on the venue of a marriage solemnized by a judge

**Sanctions:**

*   Forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leaves).
*   Prejudice to future government service.
    *   Notably, dismissal was not possible due to the judge's intervening retirement.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Family Code, Articles 7 & 8:** Central to the ruling, defining jurisdiction and venue for marriage solemnization.  Specifically, the violation of Article 8's venue restrictions.
*   **Article 29, Family Code:** Defines requirements if parties live in remote areas.
*   **Administrative Order No. 125-2007:** (Guidelines on the Solemnization of Marriage by the Members of the Judiciary)
*   **Beso vs. Daguman:**  Cited to reinforce the principle that judges must abide by the law.
*   **Palma v. Judge George E. Omelio, Regional Trial Court, Br. 14, Davao City (then of Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Br. 4, Davao City), Judge Virgilio G. Murcia, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Br. 2, et al.:** Precedent of similar misconduct, affixing signature without solemnization

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion/Subjective Factors:**  The judge's reliance on "pity" highlights the risk of subjective considerations overriding clear statutory mandates.
*   **Commercialization of Marriage Solemnization:**  The involvement of a travel agency (DLS Travel and Tours) raises concerns about the potential commercialization of the solemnization process.
*   **Due Process:** The judge attempted to shift the blame of blame onto DLS Travel and Tours but to no avail as it was his duty to ensure the solemnization followed the requirements of the law
*   **Repeat Offender:** The judge's prior misconduct (A.M. No. RTJ-10-2223) significantly influenced the severity of the penalty in this case.
