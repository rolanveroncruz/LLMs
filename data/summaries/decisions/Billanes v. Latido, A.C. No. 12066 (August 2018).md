**Case:** *Vicente Ferrer A. Billanes vs. Atty. Leo S. Latido*, A.C. No. 12066, August 28, 2018.

**Summary:** This is an administrative case against Atty. Leo S. Latido, filed by Vicente Ferrer A. Billanes, for professional misconduct related to the procurement of a fraudulent annulment decree. The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Latido for violating Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.

**Allegations & Findings:**

*   Billanes engaged Latido to handle his annulment.
*   Latido presented Billanes with a purported RTC decision from Ballesteros, Cagayan, (RTC Decision) granting the annulment, which later proved to be fraudulent.
*   Latido assisted in annotating the fake RTC Decision on Billanes' marriage certificate and in his subsequent remarriage.
*   The Australian Embassy flagged the RTC Decision as fraudulent, leading to visa application denial.
*   Latido initially claimed he referred the case to another attorney, "Atty. Aris Panaligan" but provided no corroborating evidence.
*   The Supreme Court found Latido's defense inconsistent and incredible. The Court concluded, based on substantial evidence, that Latido procured the fake RTC Decision.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Upholding the law and legal processes (Canon 1):** Latido's fabrication and use of a fraudulent court decision clearly violates this principle.
*   **Honesty and integrity:** Latido's actions constitute dishonesty and a breach of his ethical obligations to the legal profession.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Latido was found guilty of violating Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR.
*   **Disbarment:** Latido was disbarred from the practice of law, with his name stricken from the roll of attorneys.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** Latido's defense relied heavily on his uncorroborated testimony about referring the case. The absence of evidence of the purported referral proved fatal.
*   **Venue Issue:** The Court highlighted the discrepancy in venue (RTC-Ballesteros) given the parties' residency. This should have raised a red flag for any diligent attorney.
*   **Assistance with Subsequent Marriage:**  Latido's assistance with the annotation of the fraudulent decision and Billanes' remarriage further implicated him in the fraudulent scheme.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 1.01, Canon 1, CPR:** The central rule violated.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:** Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, particularly Section 4 regarding venue requirements.
*   *Reyes v. Nieva*, 794 Phil. 360 (2016): Clarified the evidentiary threshold in disbarment cases is substantial evidence.
*   *Tan v. Diamante*, 740 Phil. 382 (2014): Disbarment for falsifying a court order.
*   *Taday v. Apoya, Jr.*, A.C. No. 11981: Disbarment for authoring a fake court decision in an annulment case.

**Conclusion:** Atty. Latido was disbarred for procuring a fake RTC Decision, a clear violation of the CPR. The Court relied on substantial evidence, highlighting the lack of corroboration for Latido's defense and inconsistencies in his narrative.
