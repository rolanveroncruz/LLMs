## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Rojas y Villablanca, Jr.*, G.R. No. 222563 (2018)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Reynaldo Rojas, Jr. of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) due to the prosecution's failure to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found critical lapses in the arresting officers' adherence to the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of R.A. 9165, specifically regarding the chain of custody of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs
*   **Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165:** Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs
*   **Section 21 of R.A. 9165:** Mandates specific procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photographing of seized items.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official during inventory.
    *   Required signatures on the inventory copies.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. 9165:** Clarifies the procedure of the initial inventory and photography of the seized drugs and allows non-compliance with requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team

**Liabilities & Penalties (Reversed due to procedural errors):**

*   RTC found Rojas guilty of both violations, sentencing him to:
    *   Life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000 for the Section 5 violation.
    *   12 years and 1 day to 14 years imprisonment and a fine of PHP 300,000 for the Section 11 violation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Broken Chain of Custody:** The Court emphasized that the prosecution failed to maintain an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs.
*   **Failure to Immediately Mark the Seized Drugs:** The arresting officers did not mark the seized drugs immediately upon seizure or during the inventory at the Barangay Hall, which violated procedure and exposed the seized drugs to the possibility of switching or tampering.
*   **Lack of Required Witnesses during Inventory:** Failure to secure the presence of DOJ and media representatives during the inventory, as required by Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and failure to provide any justificiation for their absence. The accused also did not sign the inventory despite being required.
*   **Ambiguous Witness Testimony:** No witness testified regarding the circumstances of the marking of the seized drugs.
*   **Lack of Documentary Evidence:** No photographs of the seized drugs were presented, in spite of R.A. 9165s requirement to do so.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The core statute defining the offenses and procedures.
*   The decision cites existing jurisprudence highlighting the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 to maintain the integrity of the evidence and prevent tampering or substitution.
*   Case Law: *People v. Maraorao*, G.R. No. 174369, June 20, 2012
*   Case Law: *People v. Bautista*, G.R. No. 177320, February 22, 2012
*   Case Law: *Reyes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 180177, April 18, 2012

*   Case Law: *People v. Saclena*, G.R. No. 192261, November 16, 2011

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the significant breaches in the procedural safeguards of R.A. 9165, emphasizing the importance of strict compliance to ensure the integrity of evidence and protect the rights of the accused. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of proper documentation and adherence to prescribed procedures in drug-related cases to avoid potential constitutional violations. The acquittal highlights the prosecution's burden to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including the corpus delicti, which was not adequately established in this case.
