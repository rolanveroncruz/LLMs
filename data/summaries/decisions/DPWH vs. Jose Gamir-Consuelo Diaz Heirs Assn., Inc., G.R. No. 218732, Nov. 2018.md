## Legal Document Summary: Republic vs. Jose Gamir-Consuelo Diaz Heirs Association, Inc.

**Case:** G.R. No. 218732, November 12, 2018 (Republic vs. Jose Gamir-Consuelo Diaz Heirs Association, Inc.)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Decision reversing RTC Decision.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines (represented by DPWH)
*   **Respondent:** Jose Gamir-Consuelo Diaz Heirs Association, Inc.

**Subject Matter:** Claim for interest on just compensation for land acquired by the DPWH.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent owned land later used for Sta. Ana Avenue, a national road.
*   DPWH took possession in 1957 without formal expropriation.
*   In 2005, parties executed a Deed of Absolute Sale for P275,099.24, which Respondent received in full. The property was registered to the Petitioner under TCT No. T-390639.
*   Respondent filed a complaint in 2006 seeking interest from 1957, arguing the 2005 payment reflected 1957 land value and did not constitute full just compensation.

**Lower Court Decisions:**

*   **RTC:** Dismissed the complaint.
*   **CA:** Reversed, ruling the Deed of Absolute Sale didn't equate to constitutionally mandated just compensation (requires prompt payment). The CA awarded 12% legal interest from 1957, relying on *Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines* (647 Phil. 251 (2010)). It deemed the deed not to be a waiver.

**Issue:** Is Respondent entitled to interest despite the absence of a stipulation for it in the Deed of Absolute Sale?

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **granted** the petition and **reversed** the CA decision, reinstating the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Arguments:**
    *   Parol Evidence Rule bars claiming interest not stipulated in the Deed of Absolute Sale.
    *   Voluntary execution of the Deed, therefore an abandonment of the claim.
    *   *Apo Fruits* inapplicable; this case involves an agreed-upon sale, not an expropriation dispute.
    *   Civil Code provisions on contract should apply as the transaction was a negotiated sale.
*   **Respondent's Argument:**  Arguments raised by Petitioner were addressed by the CA.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   **Eminent Domain vs. Voluntary Sale:**  Eminent domain (involuntary sale) necessitates just compensation including prompt payment, justifying interest to compensate for delayed payment. However, this case involves a *voluntary sale*, not expropriation.  *Republic v. Roque, Jr.*, G.R. No. 203610, October 10, 2016, 805 SCRA 524, 546-547 highlighted the difference. In a negotiated sale, the Republic doesn't have the same obligation as that in expropriation where the property must be returned should the public purpose for which the expropriation was done did not materialize.
    *   **Parol Evidence Rule:**  Respondent can't introduce extrinsic evidence (prior demands for interest) to contradict the clear terms of the Deed of Absolute Sale, which contained no provision for interest. This is covered in Section 9, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court.
    *   **Contract is Law:**  The Deed of Absolute Sale is the law between the parties. Parties are bound by its stipulations per *Spouses Villanueva v. Court of Appeals* (671 Phil. 467, 479 (2011)).
    *   Respondent did not put in issue in its complaint any ambiguity or validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale, or its failure to reflect the parties' true intention.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **For Respondent:** Loses claim for significant interest dating back to 1957.  Potentially missed opportunity to bargain for interest or initiate expropriation proceedings.
*   **For DPWH/Government:** Sets a precedent where negotiated sales are viewed differently from expropriation. Could face future claims arguing the taking was *de facto* expropriation.
*   **Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Points:** Lack of any clause indicating reservation of right to claim interest.
* Parol Evidence rule states a party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading: (a) an intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection in the written agreement; (b) the failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties; (c) the validity of the written agreement; or (d) the existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors-in-interest after the execution of the written agreement.

*   Revised Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 9 (Parol Evidence Rule)

*   *Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, 647 Phil. 251 (2010) (Distinguished)
*   *Republic v. Roque, Jr.*, G.R. No. 203610, October 10, 2016, 805 SCRA 524, 546-547

*   *Spouses Paras v. Kimwa Construction and Development Corporation*, 757 Phil. 582, 590 (2015)

**Legal Precision:**

The court's decision hinged on the distinction between eminent domain and voluntary sale. By voluntarily entering into a Deed of Absolute Sale, the respondent waived its right to subsequently claim interest not stipulated in the contract due to the Parol Evidence Rule. The court emphasized that parties are bound by their contracts, and courts should not interfere to rewrite them.
