## Legal Document Summary: Pyro Copper Mining Corp. vs. Mines Adjudication Board, et al. (G.R. No. 179674)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing Court of Appeals Resolutions dismissing a Petition for Review of a Mines Adjudication Board (MAB) decision. The MAB decision affirmed the Panel of Arbitrators' (POA) dismissal of Pyro Copper's Verified Protest/Opposition to Montague Resources' Application for Exploration Permit.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Dispute:** Pyro Copper Mining Corporation ("Pyro") protested Montague Resources Philippines Corporation's ("Montague") application for an Exploration Permit (EXPA No. 21) covering the same land as Pyro's previously approved Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA No. 153-2000-1).
*   **Timeline:**
    *   Pyro's MPSA approved (2000).
    *   Montague filed EXPA application (Sept 12, 2003).
    *   Pyro's MPSA cancelled by DENR Memorandum Order (DMO) No. 2005-03 (Feb 1, 2005).
    *   Pyro protested Montague's application (filed August 30, 2005).
    *   Montague issued Exploration Permit (Sept 1, 2005).
    *   POA dismissed Pyro's protest (Sept 14, 2005).
    *   MAB affirmed POA's dismissal (Dec 28, 2006).
*   **Procedural Issues:** CA dismissed Pyro's petition due to failure to attach pertinent documents and lack of proof of authority for Atty. Acsay to sign the Verification and Certification Against Forum Shopping.

**Key Issues & Ruling:**

1.  **Authority to Sign Verification and Certification:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the CA did not err in dismissing the Petition because Pyro failed to adequately demonstrate that Atty. Acsay had the authority to sign the Verification and Certification against Forum Shopping for the Petition. The board resolution only authorized the signature for the Motion for Extension of Time, not the Petition itself. A board resolution authorizing a corporate officer to execute the Certification against Forum Shopping is necessary. *Citation: Gonzales v. Climax Mining Ltd., G.R. No. 161957, 28 February 2005.*

2.  **Timeliness of Protest:** Even assuming proper authority, the SC ruled the Verified Protest/Opposition was filed out of time. DAO No. 96-40, Section 204, and the Rules on Pleadings, Practice and Procedure before the Panel of Arbitrators and MAB explicitly require that a protest be accompanied by payment of the prescribed docket fee. The docket fee was paid beyond the reglementary period, rendering the protest untimely. *Citation: DAO No. 96-40, Section 204*.

3.  **Need for Certification Against Forum Shopping:** The SC held that a Verified Protest/Opposition constitutes an initiatory pleading, requiring a certification against forum shopping. Section 4, Rule 1 of the Rules on Pleading, Practice and Procedure before the Panel of Arbitrators and the MAB allows the application of the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court by analogy or in a suppletory manner, in the interest of expeditious justice and whenever practical and convenient; and, according to Section 5, Rule 7 of the Revised Rules of Court a certification against forum shopping should be attched to initiatory pleadings.

4.  **Mootness:** The issuance of DMO No. 2005-03 cancelling Pyro's MPSA and the subsequent issuance of the Exploration Permit to Montague rendered Pyro's protest moot.  The proper remedy was to seek cancellation of the permit, but the POA lacked jurisdiction to cancel existing mineral rights.

5.  **Jurisdiction of Panel of Arbitrators:** The Panel of Arbitrators does not have the authority to deny or revoke the Exploration Permit, which lies with the MGB. POA jurisdiction is limited to disputes involving applications for mineral rights, not cancellation of existing ones. *Citation: Sec. 77, Republic Act No. 7942; Olympic Mines and Development Corporation v. Platinum Group Metals Corporation, G.R. Nos. 178188, 180674, 181141 and 183527, 8 May 2009*.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **For Pyro Copper:** Pyro bears the cost of litigation and faces the risk of losing its claim to the mining area due to the cancellation of its MPSA and the valid grant of an Exploration Permit to Montague. Further appeals are unlikely to succeed based on the SC's reasoning. Pyro faces the loss of their mining claim and potential damages.
*   **For Atty. Acsay:** Though not explicitly mentioned, if Atty. Acsay misrepresented his authority to sign pleadings, he could face professional liability and sanctions from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the board resolution granting authority to Atty. Acsay was a contentious point.  The SC adopted a strict interpretation, finding that it did not extend beyond the specified motion.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995)
*   DENR Administrative Order No. 96-40 (DAO No. 96-40)
*   1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure (Rules 42, 43)
