**Case Summary: *Cabador v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 186001 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC order that treated Petitioner's motion to dismiss as a demurrer to evidence filed without leave, resulting in a waiver of his right to present evidence.

**Key Issue:** Whether Cabador's Motion to Dismiss was a Demurrer to Evidence, thus waiving his right to present a defense, or a Motion based on denial of right to speedy trial.

**Facts:** Cabador was charged with murder. After the prosecution presented five witnesses over five years with multiple delays, the RTC ordered them to formally offer documentary evidence, granting multiple extensions. Cabador then filed a Motion to Dismiss citing prolonged delays and insufficiency of prosecution's evidence. The prosecution filed its formal offer on the same day. The RTC treated Cabador's motion as a Demurrer to Evidence filed without leave, thereby waiving his right to present evidence.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held Cabador's Motion to Dismiss was based on the violation of his right to speedy trial, not a demurrer to evidence. Therefore, he did not waive his right to present evidence. The SC reversed the CA and RTC decisions, directing the RTC to rule on the Motion to Dismiss based on speedy trial considerations.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Accused's Argument:** Motion to Dismiss was predicated on violation of right to speedy trial (Art. III, Sec. 16, Constitution), citing unreasonable delays caused by prosecution's absences and repeated extension requests. He argues his statements regarding the inadequacy of the evidence were merely conclusions based on the protracted proceedings and were not sufficient to constitute a Demurrer to Evidence.

*   **RTC & CA's Interpretation:** Motion to Dismiss was deemed a Demurrer to Evidence because it argued the prosecution's evidence was insufficient to support a conviction. Filing it without leave of court meant waiver of the right to present evidence.

*   **Supreme Court Reasoning:** Applied the *Enojas, Jr. v. COMELEC* (347 Phil. 510 (1997)) criteria to distinguish between a Demurrer and Motion to Dismiss. The Court focused on the "good faith allegations, stage of proceedings, and the primary objective" of the pleading. It found the primary objective of the motion was to assert the right to speedy trial, evidenced by the numerous references to delays and absences by the prosecution. The references to the insufficiency of the evidence were considered mere conclusions, lacking the specificity required of a formal demurrer. It was deemed premature, as prosecution hadn't rested its case.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Obligated to ensure a speedy trial. Failure to do so can be grounds for dismissal.
*   **Accused:** Right to a speedy trial.
*   **Trial Court:** Duty to diligently manage the proceedings.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Mischaracterization of Pleadings:** Risk of a Motion to Dismiss being misconstrued as a Demurrer, leading to waiver of the right to present a defense, especially when the motion contains arguments regarding evidence sufficiency.
*   **Ambiguity in Motives:** The line between arguing speedy trial violation and insufficient evidence is blurry, requiring courts to carefully assess the primary objective of the motion based on *Enojas, Jr.* test.
*   **Untimely filing:** The timing of events (prosecution's formal offer of evidence and Cabador's motion to dismiss filed on the same day, before Cabador could object to the formal offer, and before the trial court could act on the offer) was critical in the Court's determination.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 16:** Right to a speedy trial.
*   **Rule 119, Section 23, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Demurrer to evidence (specifically the consequences of filing without leave).
*   ***Enojas, Jr. v. Commission on Elections*** (347 Phil. 510 (1997)): Framework for determining whether a pleading is a demurrer to evidence or a motion to dismiss.
*   ***People v. Hernandez***, G.R. Nos. 154218 & 154372, August 28, 2006: Reiterates a motion to dismiss may be filed on the ground of denial of right to speedy trial.
*   ***Guerrero v. Court of Appeals***, 327 Phil. 496, 507 (1996): Defines denial of right to speedy trial.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The Court emphasizes the detrimental consequences of deeming a motion a demurrer, especially given the seriousness of the crime.
*   The critical factor is that the prosecution had not yet rested its case, as the formal offer was still pending resolution. Therefore, Cabador had no basis to file a demurrer to evidence.
*   The Court considered the specific wording of the motion and the context of the case in arriving at its decision.
