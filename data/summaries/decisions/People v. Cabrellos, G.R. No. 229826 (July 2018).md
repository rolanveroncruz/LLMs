Okay, here's a legal summary of the document you provided, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Name:** *People of the Philippines v. Patricia Cabrellos y Dela Cruz* G.R. No. 229826, July 30, 2018 (837 Phil. 428)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a CA Decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused for Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs in violation of Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** The accused was charged with and convicted of:
    *   Violation of Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs): Selling 0.08 gram of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu).
    *   Violation of Section 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs): Possessing 0.64 gram of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Prosecution alleged a buy-bust operation was conducted based on a tip.  A poseur-buyer purchased Shabu from the accused.  Search incident to arrest revealed more Shabu in her possession.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  A critical issue is the flawed chain of custody. Two separate inventories were conducted:
    *   First at Ayungon Police Station with only a Barangay Kagawad present.
    *   Second at Dumaguete Police Station with DOJ and Media representatives present, but no elected public official.
    *   A single "Receipt of Property Seized" was prepared, signed by different witnesses at different times and locations, indicating an attempt to circumvent the witness requirement.
*   **Defense:** The accused claimed she was tending to her child when unidentified individuals looking for her husband brought her to the police station and coerced her to sign a document signed by a barangay official.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted the accused based on *in flagrante delicto* arrest and finding of drugs during the search.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC ruling, finding substantial compliance with the chain of custody requirements.

**Court's Ruling/Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* the accused.
*   The Court held that the police officers committed *unjustified deviations* from the prescribed chain of custody rule under Section 21 of RA 9165.  Specifically, there was a failure to properly comply with the required witness rule during the inventory of seized items.
*   The court found that the arresting officers conducted two separate inventories.
*   The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for these deviations or show any genuine effort to secure the presence of all required witnesses at a single inventory.

**Legal Analysis & Key Issues:**

*   **Corpus Delicti:** The integrity of the dangerous drug is essential to establish the *corpus delicti*. The prosecution must prove an unbroken chain of custody. (*People v. Manansala*, G.R. No. 229092, February 21, 2018)
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** The Court emphasized that the procedure in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality. It dictates that the apprehending team must conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized items "immediately after seizure and confiscation" in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media and the DOJ, and any elected public official. *People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)
*   **Witness Rule:** The case highlights the importance of the three (now two with RA 10640) witness rule during inventory.  The Court stresses that piecemeal compliance defeats the purpose of preventing switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution must *prove* justifiable grounds for non-compliance. Mere unavailability of witnesses is insufficient.  *People v. Umipang*, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012). The Court will not presume these grounds.  *People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637 (2010).
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The State carries the heavy burden of proving the elements of the offense and the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.
*   **RA 10640 amendment** The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of complying with the proper chain of custody procedure for the integrity and evidentiary value of the items allegedly seized. The original provisions of Section 21 and its IRR require the presence of no less than three witnesses: (a) a representative from the media, and (b) the DOJ, and; (c) any elected public official who shall be required to sign copies of the inventory and be given copy thereof. *People v. Ramirez*, G.R. No. 225690, January 17, 2018.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The primary risk is the *failure to adhere strictly* to the chain of custody requirements under RA 9165, potentially leading to acquittal. The circumstances justifying deviations must be clearly documented and provable.
*   The case underscores the *importance of proper training for law enforcement* regarding chain of custody procedures and the need to ensure the availability of required witnesses.
*   The failure to account for the elected public official in the second inventory is a key issue, highlighting the need for consistent adherence to procedural rules.
*   This highlights the tensions between drug enforcement efforts and the protection of individual rights, emphasizing the Constitution covers both the innocent and guilty. *People v. Mamangon*, G.R. No. 229102, January 29, 2018
