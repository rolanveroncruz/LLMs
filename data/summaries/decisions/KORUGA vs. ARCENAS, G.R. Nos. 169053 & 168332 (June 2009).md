## Legal Document Summary: *Koruga v. Arcenas, Jr.* (G.R. Nos. 168332 & 169053)

**Overview:** Two consolidated petitions concerning a minority stockholder's (Koruga) complaint against Banco Filipino's Board of Directors and BSP Monetary Board members for violations of the Corporation Code, inspection of corporate records, and requests for receivership and a management committee.

**Key Issue:** Jurisdiction â€“ whether the RTC or the BSP has jurisdiction over the complaint. The Supreme Court ultimately found that the **BSP has exclusive jurisdiction.**

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Koruga's Claims:**
    *   Violation of Sections 31-34 of the Corporation Code (self-dealing, conflicts of interest).
    *   Denial of stockholder's right to inspect corporate records (Sections 74 & 75, Corp. Code).
    *   Requests for Receivership and Management Committee (Rule 59, Rules of Civil Procedure; Securities Regulation Code; Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies; General Banking Law of 2000; New Central Bank Act). Alleges unsafe, unsound, and fraudulent banking practices.
*   **Arcenas, et al.'s (Defendants') Claims:**
    *   Lack of RTC jurisdiction.
    *   Improper service of summons.
    *   Forum-shopping (pending case before the Monetary Board of the BSP).
    *   Suit is a nuisance/harassment.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA) Holding:** Initially sided with the defendants by issuing a preliminary injunction against the RTC, but later ruled that the RTC did not abuse its discretion and remanded the case.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **GR No. 168332 (Koruga's Petition for Certiorari): DISMISSED** as moot and academic because the CA Decision dissolved the preliminary injunction.
*   **GR No. 169053 (Arcenas, et al.'s Petition for Review on Certiorari): GRANTED.** The CA's decision was SET ASIDE, and the RTC case was DISMISSED.
*   **Rationale:** The BSP has exclusive jurisdiction over matters concerning banking practices, director/officer loans, and determining if a bank is conducting business in an unsafe/unsound manner. Allegations of self-dealing involve banking activities regulated by the BSP, not ordinary intra-corporate matters.

**Statutory References:**

*   Corporation Code (Sections 31-34, 74, 75)
*   General Banking Law of 2000 (R.A. 8791)
*   New Central Bank Act (R.A. 7653, Sections 29, 30, 37)
*   Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 59)

**Case Law:**

* *Central Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 88353, May 8, 1992, 208 SCRA 652: Affirms BSP's exclusive authority to assess the condition of banks and take necessary steps.
*   *Miranda v. Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation*, G.R. No. 169334, September 8, 2006, 501 SCRA 288
*   *In Re: Petition for Assistance in the Liquidation of the Rural Bank of Bokod (Benguet), Inc., PDIC v. Bureau of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 158261, December 18, 2006, 511 SCRA 123: Special law (New Central Bank Act) prevails over general law (Corporation Code).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Banco Filipino Directors/Officers:** Subject to the supervisory and regulatory powers of the BSP, including potential administrative sanctions under Section 37 of the New Central Bank Act.
*   **Minority Stockholders:** Limited standing to question Monetary Board actions; only stockholders representing the majority of capital stock can file a petition for certiorari.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Directors & Officers:** Face potential sanctions from the BSP if found to have engaged in unsafe/unsound banking practices or self-dealing.
*   **Stockholders:** May be prejudiced by BSP actions concerning bank management/receivership, however their ability to legally challenge such actions is limited based on percentage of shareholding.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The case revolves around whether certain actions and loans constitute "unsafe or unsound banking practices," requiring BSP expertise. This determination depends on complex factual and financial analyses.

**Legal Precision Note:** The Supreme Court emphasizes that the BSP's actions under Sections 29 and 30 of the New Central Bank Act are "final and executory" and can only be challenged via certiorari, alleging *excess of jurisdiction* or *grave abuse of discretion* amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
