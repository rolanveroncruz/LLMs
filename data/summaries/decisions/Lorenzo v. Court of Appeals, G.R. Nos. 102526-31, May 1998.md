**Case Summary: *Sps. Lagandaon v. Court of Appeals***

**Citation:** 352 Phil. 928 (G.R. Nos. 102526-31, May 21, 1998)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Sps. Lorenzo and Cecilia Lagandaon and Overseas Agricultural Development Corporation.
*   **Respondents:** Sps. Banoyo, Sps. Batayola, Vasquez, Sps. Gomez, Aurora Gomez, Sps. David, Sps. Bongco, Sps. Solidum, Sps. Sitjar, Sps. Viva (Purchasers of land from Pacweld Steel Corp.).

**Facts:**

*   **Original Contracts to Sell:** Private respondents entered into Contracts to Sell with Pacweld Steel Corporation (Pacweld), owned by Lorenzo Lagandaon, for subdivision lots, payable in installments.
*   **Pacweld's Breach:** Pacweld failed to develop the subdivision as per the contracts. A prior case (Civil Case No. 87763) ordered Pacweld to comply with its obligations.
*   **DBP Foreclosure:** Pacweld's property was foreclosed by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) due to unpaid loans.
*   **DBP Sale to Lagandaons:** DBP sold the foreclosed properties to the Lagandaons via a Deed of Absolute Sale containing a clause that the vendees (Lagandaons) would assume all liabilities arising from any litigation involving the properties.
*   **Lagandaons' Rescission Suits:** The Lagandaons filed multiple suits to rescind the original contracts to sell, claiming they were "stale" and alleging a "modified agreement to sell" requiring the private respondents to update their accounts without obligating the Lagandaons to perform Pacweld's development duties.

**Issues:**

1.  Were there valid modified contracts to sell?
2.  Did the Lagandaons assume Pacweld's obligations under the original contracts to sell?

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision.
*   The finding of the trial court that no modified contracts existed between the petitioners and private respondents was upheld and was considered a question of fact not reviewable under Rule 45.
*   The Lagandaons assumed Pacweld's obligations due to their knowledge of the existing contracts, the clause in the Deed of Absolute Sale obligating them to assume liabilities arising from litigation, and their subsequent actions of demanding payment under the original contracts.
*   The Maceda Law (R.A. 6552) was held inapplicable as the Lagandaons were not installment buyers.
*   Petitioners are not entitled to be shielded as buyers in good faith and for value. They had actual knowledge of the contracts to sell made by Pacweld through Lorenzo Lagandaon who was president of Pacweld at the time he signed the contracts.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Assumption of Liabilities Clause:** The Deed of Absolute Sale with DBP contained a clause that the Lagandaons would assume "any and all claims, liens, assessments, liabilities and/or damages whatsoever arising from any case or litigation involving the above properties."
*   **Obligations of Pacweld:** The original contracts to sell obligated Pacweld to develop the subdivision. This obligation was the subject of Civil Case No. 87763.
*   **Obligations of Purchasers (Respondents):** Obligated to continue to pay.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lagandaons:** Liable for Pacweld's obligations to develop the subdivision as per the original contracts to sell and the judgment in Civil Case No. 87763.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Liabilities" Clause:** The breadth of the assumption of liabilities clause in the Deed of Absolute Sale is potentially contentious. Did it clearly and unequivocally encompass Pacweld's obligations to develop the subdivision?

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law, generally precluding review of factual findings.
*   **R.A. 6552 (Maceda Law):** Protects real estate installment buyers but held inapplicable as Lagandaons were the sellers, not installment buyers.

**Conclusion:**

The Lagandaons are bound by Pacweld's obligations due to their assumption of liabilities clause and their conduct acknowledging the original contracts. This decision reinforces the principle that a buyer of property with knowledge of existing encumbrances cannot claim good faith and avoid those obligations. The scope of the assumption of liability clause and the extent of development obligations remain potential areas of dispute.
