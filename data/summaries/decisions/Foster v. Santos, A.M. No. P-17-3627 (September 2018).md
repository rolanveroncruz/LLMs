**Legal Document Summary: Foster v. Santos, Jr. (A.M. No. P-17-3627)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff Rodolfo T. Santos, Jr., for gross neglect of duty and inefficiency.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Ministerial Duty:** Sheriffs have a ministerial duty to promptly and expeditiously enforce writs of execution (Olympia-Geronilla v. Montemayor, Jr., Mahusay v. Gareza, Atty. Sanglay v. Padua II).
*   **Immediate Demand for Payment (Rule 39, Section 9):** Upon receiving a writ of execution for money, the sheriff *must* demand immediate payment from the judgment obligor (Atty. Agtang). Failure to do so constitutes a breach of duty. The Sheriff should not have relied on Atty. Agtang's promise to personally settle the matter with complainant.
*   **Levy on Properties (Rule 39, Section 9):** Only if the judgment obligor cannot pay should the sheriff levy on properties (personal first, then real, excluding those exempt).
*   **Garnishment (Rule 39, Section 9):** Levy on debts and credits due to the judgment obligor.
*   **Return of Writ (Rule 39, Section 14):** The sheriff must return the writ immediately after satisfaction, and report to the court every 30 days on proceedings taken, even if unsatisfied. This includes the reason for non-satisfaction. Periodic reports are critical (Raut-Raut v. Gaputan).
*   **Due Diligence:** The sheriff is expected to exhaust reasonable means to locate the judgment obligor and their assets.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** Failure to give attention to an expected task, signifying disregard due to carelessness or indifference (Office of the Court Administrator v. Licay, Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabrera-Faller).
*   **Sanctions:** Under RRACCS/RACCS, simple neglect of duty is a less grave offense, punishable by suspension (first offense). A fine may be imposed instead of suspension in some circumstances (Olympia-Geronilla v. Montemayor, Jr., Raut-Raut v. Gaputan, Atty. Sanglay v. Padua II). The court imposed a fine equivalent to one month's salary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Timeliness:** The sheriff's delay in serving the writ (months after receipt) and in submitting required reports constitutes a significant failure.
*   **Improper Delegation of Duty:** The sheriff attempted to shift the burden of obtaining a certificate of non-encumbrance from China Bank to the complainant, which is his responsibility.
*   **Reliance on Judgment Obligor's Promises:** The sheriff's reliance on Atty. Agtang's assurances of settlement, without taking further action to enforce the writ, constitutes negligence.
*   **The Court order for LTO certification**: The court issued an order for the certification to LTO, this could have been potentially used to compel China Bank to furnish certification of non-encumbrance.
*   **Mitigation:** The long years of service by Rodolfo was accounted for.
*   **Ambiguity of term "residential home being exempt from execution of judgment".** The Sheriff relied on this, but it would be useful to determine the circumstances.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sections 9 & 14:** Execution of Judgments.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS) / 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS):** Disciplinary actions.

*   **Tablate v. Rañeses (574 Phil. 536):** Simple Neglect of Duty

**Conclusion:**

The Sheriff was found guilty of simple neglect of duty, primarily for his delay in enforcing the writs of execution and failing to submit timely reports. The ruling underscores the importance of sheriffs fulfilling their ministerial duties promptly and diligently. The reliance on judgment debtor assurances and the failure to actively pursue enforcement actions were key factors in the finding of negligence.
