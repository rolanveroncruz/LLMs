**Legal Document Summary: G.R. Nos. 174986, 175071, & 181415 (Consolidated)**

**Nature of the Document:**  Consolidated decision resolving three petitions for review related to the failure of Finvest Securities Co., Inc. (Finvest), a stock brokerage firm, to meet its obligations due to alleged mismanagement by its officers.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **G.R. Nos. 174986 & 175071 (Finvest v. Raquel-Santos, Mallari & PSE):**
    *   Finvest sued former officers Armand Raquel-Santos (President) and Annalissa Mallari (Administrative Officer) for accounting and damages related to missing stock certificates and diverted sales proceeds (Annex X of the complaint). Also implicated Philippine Stock Exchange(PSE) for illegally suspending Finvest's operations and imposing arbitrary fines/penalties.
    *   SEC initially issued a partial judgment against Raquel-Santos and Mallari, ordering accounting which was followed by SEC en banc approving the parties to remand the case to the Securities Investigation and Clearing Division for service of summonses.
    *   Finvest obtained a preliminary injunction against PSE preventing it from liquidating Finvest and selling its membership seat.
    *   Lower court ordered an accounting and made the injunction permanent. Appealed to the CA which granted Finvest's petition to render accounting within 60 days and jointly pay 18,184,855.89 if they failed.
    *   The CA affirmed validity of permanent injunction, stating the PSE's right to sell only pertains to obligations already determined (Para 5(a) of Pledge Agreement). The PSE appealed arguing that it was legally obligated to recommend to the SEC if liquidation was to the best interest.
    *   **Contentious Clause:**  The CA's order for Raquel-Santos and Mallari to pay P18,184,855.89 if they fail to account. Raquel-Santos and Mallari's argument that the CA had no jurisdiction to order the payment of Raquel-Santos' unliquidated advances, as it wasn't alleged in the complaint, and the CA failed to fix a beginning balance for the accounting was rejected by the Supreme Court.

*   **G.R. No. 181415 (Finvest v. Trans-Phil Marine & Garcia):**
    *   Finvest failed to deliver shares to clients Trans-Phil Marine Enterprises, Inc. (TMEI) and Roland Garcia. TMEI initially ordered to deliver but then changed mind to a refund of value shares.
    *   RTC ordered Finvest to return the value of the undelivered shares. The CA affirmed based on Article 1191 of the Civil Code (rescission in reciprocal obligations).
    *   Finvest argues there was no basis for awarding damages equal to the share value and that conflicting judgment between court rulings. Finvest to order its officers to render accounting. This argument was dismissed, the Supreme Court held that the two rulings were distinct as Finvest was responsible to its clients and Finvest's officers liable to Finvest for the missing stock.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Raquel-Santos and Mallari:** Obligation to render an accounting of stock certificates listed in Annex X of the Complaint. Joint and several liability of P18,184,855.89 if they fail to account within 60 days. Raquel-Santos is liable for unliquidated cash advances of P3,143,823.63.
*   **Finvest:** Obligation to return the value of undelivered shares to TMEI and Garcia with legal interest from the date of the complaint.
*   **PSE:** Restrained from selling Finvest's membership seat at public auction until Finvest's obligations are fully determined and liquidated.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement of Accounting:**  Difficulty in determining the exact amount outstanding and enforcing the accounting order against Raquel-Santos and Mallari. The lack of specified "beginning balance" could be used as a basis for non-compliance.
*   **Liquidation of Finvest:** The injunction against PSE selling the membership seat creates uncertainty about Finvest's future and ability to meet obligations to creditors.
*   **Conflict of Judgments:** The potential for confusion arising from two rulings, one holding Finvest's officers liable to Finvest and the other holding Finvest directly liable to its clients for the missing stock certificates.

**Overall Ruling:**

The Supreme Court denied the petitions of Raquel-Santos and Mallari and PSE. The Court affirmed the orders for accounting, payment of unliquidated advances, and the injunction against PSE selling Finvest's membership seat. The Court also denied Finvest's petition in the TMEI/Garcia case, upholding the order for Finvest to return the value of the undelivered shares.
