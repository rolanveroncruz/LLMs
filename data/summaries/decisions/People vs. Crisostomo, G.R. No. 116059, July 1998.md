## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Crisostomo*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Manuel Crisostomo y Cabanban*, G.R. No. 116059, July 23, 1998.

**Core Issue:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for murder. The RTC found Crisostomo guilty of murdering Nartito Gavina and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay P50,000 in indemnity.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction upheld:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the RTC's decision, finding Crisostomo guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimonies of Susana and Manuel Gavina (victim's parents) who identified Crisostomo as fleeing the scene with a gun immediately after the shooting. The autopsy report (Exhibit "E") detailed a gunshot wound to the head, inflicted at close range, and the recovery of a bullet.
*   **Defense:** Crisostomo presented an alibi claiming he was in San Gabriel, La Union at the time of the murder. He also claimed the victim had threatened him. This alibi was corroborated by Crisostomo's father. Other defense witnesses were presented, but they do not support the alibi.
*   **Motive:** The SC highlights Crisostomo's motive stemming from the victim's prior attempt to steal his carabao and subsequent threats.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Crisostomo:** Obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* and liable to pay P50,000 in indemnity to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense argued material inconsistencies in the testimonies of Susana and Manuel Gavina, particularly regarding whether they were awake or asleep at the time of the shooting, and in comparing the testimonies to their sworn statements. The court considered this inconsequential.
*   **Hearsay/Circumstantial Evidence:** Though the witnesses did not directly see the shooting, the court found their testimony identifying Crisostomo fleeing the scene immediately after the gunshot sufficient to convict.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes the crime of murder.
*   **Alevosia:** The court found that the killing was qualified by *alevosia* (treachery) due to the suddenness of the attack on an unsuspecting and defenseless victim.
*   **Presumption of Credibility of Witnesses:** Court relied on presumption that relatives of the deceased are unlikely to falsely accuse someone, absent evidence of improper motive.
*   Cited cases on alibi (e.g. *People v. Gamiao*), credibility of witnesses (*People v. Mendoza*, *Sumalpong v. CA*), and effect of judge presiding over case changing (*People v. Quiamco*).
