## Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-16-2454 (Philip See vs. Judge Rolando G. Mislang)

This administrative case involves a complaint filed by Philip See against Judge Rolando G. Mislang, alleging dishonesty, gross misconduct, and gross ignorance of the law stemming from the lifting of a writ of preliminary attachment in Civil Case No. 73462-PSG.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Contract and Assignment:** Complainant (See) entered a Deed of Assignment with Bautista, owner of One Top System Resources, to receive PHP 2.6M from an AFP medical procurement contract in exchange for x-ray machines. Bautista also issued post-dated checks totaling PHP 3,522,892.00 to See.
*   **Preliminary Attachment:** See filed suit and obtained a writ of preliminary attachment against Bautista's funds related to the AFP contract.
*   **AFP's Opposition:** The AFP filed a Motion to Lift/Quash the Notice of Garnishment, claiming the funds were public funds not yet due and demandable because a certificate of final acceptance was lacking.
*   **Judge's Initial Ruling:** Judge Mislang initially denied the AFP's motion, holding the funds had ceased to be public funds upon allocation to a private entity.
*   **Motion to Quash and Subsequent Order:** Bautista then filed a motion to Quash. Despite notice of the hearing, Complainant failed to appear.  Judge Mislang granted the Motion to Quash, reasoning the funds were still public funds absent a certificate of final acceptance.  Bautista immediately withdrew the funds.
*   **Administrative Complaint:** See filed this administrative complaint instead of a motion for reconsideration or appeal.
* **OCA Recommendation:** The OCA found respondent to have violated Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct and recommended a fine of Ten Thousand Pesos (Php10,000.00) and a warning.
*   **Prior Dismissal:** Note that the Respondent had been previously dismissed for Gross Ignorance of the Law in another case, and such dismissal was final.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether Judge Mislang justifiably lifted the Writ of Preliminary Attachment.
2.  Whether Judge Mislang denied See due process by resolving the motion without awaiting See's comment.
3.  Whether Judge Mislang's alleged error warrants disciplinary action.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Court *dismissed* the administrative complaint.

1.  **Justification for Lifting Attachment:** The Court held that Judge Mislang *justifiably* lifted the writ because it was prematurely granted. The funds remained public funds until the AFP issued a certificate of final acceptance, as stipulated in the contract and Deed of Assignment. The Court cited *Pacific Products, Inc. v. Ong* (260 Phil. 583 (1990)), and Administrative Circular No. 10-2000, regarding the impropriety of garnishing public funds. Allowing the garnishment would indirectly adjudicate a claim against the AFP, which falls under the COA's primary jurisdiction per PD 1445.
2.  **No Denial of Due Process:** The Court found no denial of due process. See had notice of the hearing on the Motion to Quash and an opportunity to be heard, citing *Philhouse Development Corporation v. Consolidated Orix Leasing and Finance Corporation* (408 Phil. 392 (2001)). The Court further referenced *Spouses Calo v. Spouses Tan* (512 Phil. 786 (2005)) and emphasized the lack of a requirement to await comments before ruling on motions that have been duly heard.
3.  **Improper Substitute for Judicial Remedy:** The Court stated that an administrative complaint cannot substitute for a lost judicial remedy (motion for reconsideration, appeal), citing *Martinez v. Judge De Vera* (661 Phil. 11 (2011)).

**Statutory References:**

*   PD 1445 (Commission on Audit's jurisdiction)
*   Rules of Court (Rules 52 and Internal Rules of the Supreme Court)
*   Rule 140 of the Rules of Court
*   Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   While the judge was dismissed in other cases, there was still a possibility of further administrative sanctions such as a fine. This case removes that possibility.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of when funds cease to be "public funds" and the trigger for the right to attach became the central point.
*   Complainant's assertion of a right to comment even after failing to appear for a hearing.

**Conclusion:** The Court sided with the judge, finding no grounds for administrative liability. This highlights the court's reluctance to penalize judges for decisions, particularly when there are judicial remedies available. The case reaffirms the principle that garnishment of public funds requires caution and that due process is satisfied with notice and an opportunity to be heard, even if the party fails to avail itself of that opportunity.
