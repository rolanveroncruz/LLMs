**Subject:** Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted at the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 55, Malabon City (Judge Francisco S. Lindo)

**Nature:** Administrative Matter; Investigation into judicial audit findings.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Audit Findings:** Significant backlog, including cases submitted for decision beyond the reglementary period, unacted upon cases, and discrepancies in case reporting.
*   **Charges Against Judge Lindo:** Failure to decide/resolve cases within the reglementary period (violating Sec. 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct), failure to act on cases for a considerable length of time, failure to report cases in monthly reports (violating Administrative Circular No. 4-2004), pertaining to cases from as early as the 1980s.
*   **Charges Against Ms. Borgonia (Legal Researcher & OIC):** Failure to calendar cases and failure to present cases to the audit team, along with discrepancies in the docket inventories.
*   **Resolution:** Judge Lindo found guilty of simple misconduct and undue delay. Ms. Borgonia found guilty of simple neglect of duty.

**Obligations:**

*   **Judge Lindo:** Obligation to decide cases within the prescribed period (Constitution & New Code of Judicial Conduct), to actively manage and monitor cases (Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the MTCC-Brs. 1, 2 & 3, Mandaue City, A.M. No. 02-8-188-MTCC, July 17, 2003, 406 SCRA 285, 296).
*   **Ms. Borgonia:** Obligation to assist in managing the court calendar, supervise court records, and bring cases needing action to the judge's attention (Bernaldez v. Avelino, A.M. No. MTJ-07-1672, July 9, 2007, 527 SCRA 11, 21-22).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Lindo:** Fined P20,000.00, deducted from previously withheld retirement benefits.
*   **Ms. Borgonia:** Fined the equivalent of one month's salary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Staff:** Judge Lindo's defense of relying on staff is expressly rejected; judges have a primary duty to manage their court. The court cited *Office of the Court Administrator v. Trocino, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1936, May 29, 2007, 523 SCRA 262, 272* stating "Judges and branch clerks of court should conduct personally a physical inventory of the pending cases in their courts."
*   **Discretion:** The decision notes the discretionary nature of administrative penalties. The court ultimately imposes a fine instead of suspension for Borgonia, allowing her to continue working.
*   **Inadvertence vs. Neglect:** Ms. Borgonia argued inadvertence, but the Court found simple neglect based on the state of disarray in the court records. The Court found her administratively liable for simple neglect of duty. Sesbre√±o v. Gako, Jr., A.M. No. RTJ-08-2144, November 3, 2008, p. 5; Becina v. Vivero, A.M. No. P-04-1797, March 25, 2004, 426 SCRA 261, 264.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution:** Mandates timely disposition of cases.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 6, Sec. 5:** Judges to perform duties efficiently and promptly.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 4-2004:** Judges to accurately reflect cases in monthly reports.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140:** Penalties for less serious charges (simple misconduct, undue delay).
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 52 (B) (1).** Simple neglect of duty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document outlines many instances of neglect and misconduct but finds in favor of the least serious charges.
