## Legal Document Summary: Olalia, Jr. vs. People

**Case:** G.R. No. 177276, August 20, 2008 (584 Phil. 690)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of Petitioner Graciano Santos Olalia, Jr. for Frustrated Murder.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Original Charge:** Frustrated Murder under Article 248 in relation to Articles 6 and 50 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 7659. Based on stabbing of Rommel Camacho.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted Petitioner and co-accused of Frustrated Murder, sentencing them to an indeterminate prison term.  Ordered them to pay jointly and severally actual damages.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modification to the penalty imposed.
*   **SC Decision:**  **Modified** the CA decision. Downgraded the crime to **Attempted Murder.**
*   **Reasoning:** The prosecution failed to prove that the wounds inflicted were sufficient to cause death (non-penetrating).  The court applied *Velasco v. People, G.R. No. 166479* indicating that when the wounds are insufficient to cause death, the crime is attempted murder.
*   **Penalty:** Reduced the sentence to a prison term of four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to eight (8) years and twenty (20) days of *prision mayor*, as maximum, under Art. 68, Art. 51 and Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court determined conspiracy by examining the actions before, during, and after the incident.  They concluded there was unity of design or objective drawn from the concerted acts of the assailants.
*   **Treachery:** The court affirmed the presence of treachery. The attack was a deliberate and sudden attack, affording the victim no chance to resist or escape.

**Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Petitioner (and co-accused) are criminally liable for Attempted Murder.
*   **Civil Liability:** Petitioner (and co-accused) are jointly and severally liable to pay Dionisio Camacho P12,356.75 as actual damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is now subject to the sentence for Attempted Murder and the associated penalties.
*   Solidary liability for the payment of damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Although the crime was downgraded, imprisonment remains a significant consequence.
*   The solidary liability for damages means the petitioner could be responsible for the full amount even if the co-accused are unable to pay, recourse will have to be made to the petitioner.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** The court upholds the initial pronouncement of solidary liability, potentially placing a disproportionate burden on the Petitioner if co-accused are unable to satisfy the judgment.

**Recommendations:**

*   Advise the client on the implications of the Attempted Murder conviction and the remaining prison sentence.
*   Advise the client on their solidary liability for damages and potential legal strategies to address this, such as seeking contribution from co-accused.
