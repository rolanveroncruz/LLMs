## Legal Document Summary: *Torben B. Overgaard v. Atty. Godwin R. Valdez* (A.C. No. 7902)

**Nature:** Resolution denying Atty. Valdez's Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision to disbar him.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Disbarment:** Atty. Valdez is disbarred for malpractice and gross misconduct.
*   **Restitution:** Valdez is ordered to return \$16,854 (or its PHP equivalent) to Overgaard with 6% legal interest from the date of extrajudicial demand (Nov 27, 2006), increasing to 12% from the date of promulgation of the decision until payment.
*   **Return of Documents:** Valdez is ordered to return all papers/documents received from Overgaard.

**Obligations:**

*   Valdez had a contractual obligation to provide legal services to Overgaard as stipulated in a Retainer Agreement.
*   Valdez had the obligation to attend to client matters, inform clients of the status of their cases, and return unearned fees/documents upon termination or abandonment of representation.
*   Valdez had a continuing obligation to maintain a system for receiving communications, even after relocating his office.
*   Valdez has an obligation to properly account for money entrusted to him by his client.

**Liabilities:**

*   Valdez is liable for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   Valdez is liable for the financial losses caused by his abandonment of Overgaard's cases and failure to return fees and documents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Continued non-compliance with the order of restitution will likely result in further sanctions or legal action.
*   Any attempt by Valdez to practice law after disbarment would constitute a violation of law and subject him to criminal penalties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 138, Section 30 (Rules of Court):** Emphasizes the right of an attorney to be heard before removal/suspension, but allows *ex parte* proceedings if the attorney fails to appear after reasonable notice.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Cited throughout for various violations, including:
    *   Competence and diligence (Canon 21)
    *   Accounting for client funds (Canon 16, Rule 16.01)
    *   Duties of honesty and good faith

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Notice:** Valdez claimed lack of notice due to relocation. The Court found notice sufficient because it was sent to his known office address and received by his agent. The validity of service to an agent in disbarment proceedings, especially when Valdez claims to have abandoned the premises, could be further examined.
*   **Accounting of Funds:** Valdez's explanation of how the P900,000 was spent was deemed insufficient, lacking supporting documentation (receipts).
*   **Threats to Safety:** Valdez's claim of "serious threats" to his safety, justifying his abandonment, was deemed insufficient to excuse his professional responsibilities.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the disbarment of Atty. Valdez for multiple violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically abandonment of his client, failure to account for funds, and failure to return fees and documents. The Court rejected Valdez's arguments regarding lack of notice and justification for his actions, emphasizing that an attorney has an ethical and professional duty to diligently represent their clients and maintain proper communication, even in challenging circumstances.
