## Legal Document Summary: *Bibas v. Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas) and Commission on Audit, Regional Office No. VI*, G.R. No. 172580

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of Lourdesita Bibas' (Petitioner) *certiorari* petition. The CA dismissed the *certiorari* based on procedural errors, effectively upholding the Ombudsman's Order finding Petitioner guilty of Dishonesty and dismissing her from her position as Disbursing Officer II in Silay City. The core issue revolves around a shortage of P989,461.10 in Petitioner's accounts.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Duty:** As Disbursing Officer II, Petitioner had a fiduciary duty to properly account for cash advances received for employee salaries.
*   **COA's Audit Power:** The Commission on Audit (COA) has the authority to audit government accounts and investigate discrepancies.
*   **Ombudsman's Authority:** The Office of the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate and prosecute government employees for misconduct, including Dishonesty.
*   **Section 20 of R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):** Addresses the exception for investigations filed after one year from the incident but the investigation still falls within the Ombudsman's discretion.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Liability for Dishonesty:** The Ombudsman found Petitioner liable for Dishonesty due to her failure to account for the shortage and a conflicting certification of the Silay City Accountant.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from government service was imposed by the Ombudsman and upheld due to the evidence presented.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Errors:** The CA initially dismissed based on procedural errors (wrong remedy, late filing, improper documentation). Although Petitioner argued for relaxation due to counsel's negligence and merits, the Supreme Court denied this request. This highlights the risk of ineffective counsel and the importance of adhering to procedural rules, even when seemingly unjust.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:** The Supreme Court focused on a Certification from the Office of the City Accountant stating no payrolls were missing and determined that this was credible as it showed the issue was not simply poor documentation.
*   **Interpretation of Audit Scope:** Petitioner argued the November 6, 2002 audit should not cover shortages incurred earlier in the year 2000. The Supreme Court found that the audit extended back to January 2000 and encompassed the relevant shortage.
*   **Application of Prescription:** The SC clarified that the Ombudsman had discretion to investigate even if more than one year had passed since the act/omission, and the audit period and misrepresentations made by petitioner was within the scope of discretion.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, effectively upholding the Petitioner's dismissal. The Court determined that the Ombudsman's finding of Dishonesty was based on substantial evidence, and the court weighed the argument of the procedural flaws by council versus the evidence for Dishonesty. Although there were apparent procedural errors, the Court did not find sufficient cause to relax the rules due to the unconvincing evidence presented in the merits of the case. The decision highlights the importance of accurate record-keeping, adherence to audit requirements, and the significance of counsel's competence in legal proceedings.
