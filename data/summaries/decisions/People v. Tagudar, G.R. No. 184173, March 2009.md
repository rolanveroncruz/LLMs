## Legal Document Summary: People v. Tagudar (G.R. No. 184173)

**Case Overview:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Joselito Tagudar for four counts of murder and fourteen counts of attempted murder. The crimes arose from a shooting incident at a wake. Tagudar, a police officer, and an accomplice (Molina, at large) allegedly attacked attendees with firearms.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** 4 counts of Murder (Art. 248, RPC), 14 counts of Attempted Murder (Art. 248, RPC in relation to Art. 51, RPC)
*   **Qualifying Circumstance:** Treachery was found to be present in both the consummated murders and the attempted murders.

**Obligations:**

*   **Appellant (Tagudar):** Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count of murder; indeterminate sentence of 2 years and 4 months of *prision correccional* (min) to 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* (max) for each count of attempted murder.
*   **Financial:** Ordered to pay:
    *   P50,000.00 civil indemnity for each count of murder (affirmed).
    *   P50,000.00 moral damages for each count of murder (added).
    *   P25,000.00 temperate damages for each count of murder (added).
    *   P25,000.00 exemplary damages for each count of murder (added).
    *   P20,000.00 civil indemnity for each count of attempted murder (affirmed).
    *   P10,000.00 moral damages for each count of attempted murder (added).
    *   P25,000.00 exemplary damages for each count of attempted murder (added).

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminally liable for murder and attempted murder based on positive identification by two eyewitnesses.
*   Defense of alibi was rejected due to inconsistent evidence and the fact that he was close to the crime scene at the time of the incident.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense attacked the credibility of the prosecution witnesses (Montorio and Pillor) alleging delayed reporting and unnatural reactions during the shooting. However, the courts found their testimonies credible, citing fear as the reason for the delay.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The alibi was weak and not convincingly supported, and was not geographically inconsistent with the crime scene.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While not explicitly stated, the case heavily relies on eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence connecting Tagudar to the crime.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 248 (Murder), Art. 51 (Attempted Crimes), Art. 63 (Application of indivisible penalties), Art. 61, Art. 71, Art. 64, Art. 2224 (Temperate Damages)
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in determining the sentence for attempted murder.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 2224 (Temperate damages)
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:** *People v. Gutierrez*, *People v. Almazan*, *People v. Domingo* cited regarding damage awards in similar cases. Several other cases are cited regarding credibility of witnesses, defense of alibi and temperate damages.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification:** The defense argued the unreliability of the eyewitness identification due to the circumstances (darkness, masks). However, the court determined the light source and proximity of the witnesses were sufficient for identification. The nature of the mask (ski mask) was key.

**Summary of the Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Tagudar guilty. It upheld the finding of treachery, the validity of the eyewitness identification, and rejected the alibi defense. The court modified the damage awards by adding moral and exemplary damages, bringing them in line with existing jurisprudence. The key factor in the decision was the credibility afforded to the prosecution's eyewitnesses and the failure of the defense to adequately rebut their testimony or establish a solid alibi.
