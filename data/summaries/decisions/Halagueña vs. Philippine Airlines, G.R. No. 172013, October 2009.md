## Legal Document Summary - *Halague√±a v. Philippine Airlines Inc.* (G.R. No. 172013)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45)

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Female flight attendants of Philippine Airlines (PAL).
*   **Respondent:** Philippine Airlines Incorporated (PAL).

**Subject Matter:** Jurisdiction over the validity of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provision regarding compulsory retirement age, specifically Section 144, Part A of the PAL-FASAP CBA (2000-2005), which sets a lower retirement age for female flight attendants (55) compared to male flight attendants (60) hired before November 22, 1996.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Section 144, Part A of the PAL-FASAP CBA:** Establishes compulsory retirement ages of 55 for female and 60 for male cabin attendants hired before November 22, 1996, subject to grooming standards.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** This provision is discriminatory and violates the Constitution (Section 14, Article II), the Labor Code (Article 3, Presidential Decree No. 442; Article 135 as amended by Republic Act No. 6725), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).

**Procedural History:**

1.  Petitioners filed a Special Civil Action for Declaratory Relief with the RTC of Makati City to invalidate Section 144, Part A of the PAL-FASAP CBA, alleging it is discriminatory.
2.  The RTC upheld its jurisdiction and issued a TRO and preliminary injunction against PAL's implementation of the provision.
3.  PAL filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with the Court of Appeals (CA), arguing the RTC lacked jurisdiction as it was a labor dispute falling under the jurisdiction of labor tribunals (Voluntary Arbitrator/NLRC).
4.  The CA granted PAL's petition, ruling the RTC lacked jurisdiction and ordering the case's dismissal.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Jurisdiction Lies with the RTC:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA's decision, holding that the RTC has jurisdiction over the case.
*   **Rationale:** The SC reasoned that the primary relief sought by the petitioners is the *annulment* of the CBA provision due to its alleged unconstitutionality and violation of international law (CEDAW), not the resolution of a labor dispute. The subject matter of the litigation is thus incapable of pecuniary estimation and falls under the RTC's exclusive jurisdiction under Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 19(1).
*   **No Labor Dispute:** The SC distinguished this case from a typical labor dispute, stating that the employer-employee relationship is merely incidental and the cause of action stems from constitutional and treaty obligations, not solely from the Labor Code or the CBA.
*   **Inadequacy of Labor Tribunals:** The SC stated that grievance machinery and voluntary arbitrators lack the power to determine the issues at hand due to the lack of jurisdiction and competence to decide constitutional issues and statutory retirement age issues.
*   **Remand for Trial:** The SC remanded the case to the RTC for a trial on the merits to determine whether Section 114, Part A of the PAL-FASAP CBA is discriminatory.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**
*   **PAL:** Potentially liable for discrimination against female employees if the RTC finds Section 144, Part A of the CBA unconstitutional.
*   **FASAP:** The court notes that the CBA procedure would be futile because the union and management agreed to the terms of the CBA, and FASAP made no meaningful attempt to renegotiate.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **Adverse Ruling for PAL:** If the RTC finds the provision discriminatory, PAL may be forced to allow female flight attendants to work until age 60, and may face legal challenges/financial liabilities.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The SC decision clarifies the jurisdiction of regular courts in cases where the core issue is the constitutionality or legality of a CBA provision, even if it relates to terms and conditions of employment.
*   **Labor Unrest:** A finding of discrimination could lead to labor unrest among female flight attendants.

**Relevant Case Law:**
*   *Polomolok Water District v. Polomolok General Consumers Association, Inc.* (G.R. No. 162124) - Jurisdiction determined by material allegations and relief sought.
*   *Georg Grotjahn GMBH & Co. v. Isnani* (G.R. No. 109272) - Not every dispute between employer and employee falls under labor tribunals.
*   *Gonzales v. Climax Mining Ltd.* (492 Phil. 682) - Courts have jurisdiction over questions of contract constitutionality.
*   *Rivera v. Espiritu* (G.R. No. 135547) - Annulment of contract falls under RTC jurisdiction.
*   *Pantranco North Express, Inc., v. NLRC* (G.R. No.95940) - Grievance machinery ineffective when union and company are united.
*   *Pakistan International Airlines Corporation v. Ople* (G.R.No. 61594) - Labor contracts are not solely contractual and are subject to police power.
*   *Cainta Catholic School v. Cainta Catholic School Employees Union (CCSEU)* (G.R. No. 151021) - CBA provisions violating law can be voided.

**Statutory References:**
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 19(1):** RTC jurisdiction over cases incapable of pecuniary estimation.
*   **Labor Code (Presidential Decree No. 442), Article 3:** Right to equal work and employment opportunities.
*   **Labor Code, Article 135 as amended by Republic Act No. 6725:** Prohibition on discrimination against women.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   The CBA clause itself (Section 144, Part A) is contentious as it differentiates retirement ages based on gender, which may be discriminatory. The court is not interpreting it but rather determining if it goes against the law.

**Conclusion:** This decision primarily addresses the jurisdictional issue of the case. The SC determined that the RTC, not labor tribunals, has jurisdiction to determine the validity and constitutionality of the CBA provision. The case is remanded to the RTC for a trial on the merits to determine whether the clause is discriminatory and thus unconstitutional or illegal. The main challenge will be substantiating arguments and presenting evidence that demonstrates that there is no difference between men and women, therefore proving there is unlawful discrimination.
