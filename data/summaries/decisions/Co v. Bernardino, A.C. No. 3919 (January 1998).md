**Case Summary: *Socorro T. Co vs. Atty. Godofredo N. Bernardino*, A.C. No. 3919, January 28, 1998 (349 Phil. 16)**

**Nature:** Administrative disciplinary proceeding against a lawyer, Atty. Godofredo N. Bernardino, initiated by Socorro T. Co for unprofessional and unethical conduct amounting to moral turpitude.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Respondent's Conduct:** Atty. Bernardino borrowed money from the complainant, Socorro T. Co, issuing postdated checks that were subsequently dishonored for insufficiency of funds or closure of account. He further attempted to secure a loan with a chattel mortgage but ultimately sold the car to another party.
*   **Rule 1.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:**  Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct. This is the primary rule violated. The Court emphasizes that "conduct" is not limited to professional duties.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** The Supreme Court suspended Atty. Bernardino from the practice of law for one (1) year. A warning was issued that repetition of similar acts would merit a more severe penalty.
*   **Moral Turpitude:** The issuance of bad checks and attempts to leverage influence at the Bureau of Customs are deemed acts of moral turpitude, reflecting negatively on his fitness to practice law. The Court considered prior jurisprudence like *In Re Vicente Pelaez* (44 Phil. 567 [1923]) and *Piatt v. Abordo* (58 Phil. 350 [1933]) where lawyers were disciplined for misconduct outside of their professional duties.
*   **Risk of Further Discipline:**  The Supreme Court explicitly warns against any future similar misconduct.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22):**  The complainant filed criminal complaints against Atty. Bernardino for violation of BP 22 due to the dishonored checks. *However, the acquittal in the criminal case was based on the complainant's knowledge of insufficient funds at the time of issuance, not payment of the obligation.*
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 1.01:** As stated above.
*   ***In Re Vicente Pelaez*, 44 Phil. 567 (1923):**  Established that courts can discipline lawyers for conduct outside attorney-client relationship if it demonstrates unfitness for the profession.
*   ***In Re Sotto*, 38 Phil. 569 (1923):** A lawyer can be suspended or disbarred for misconduct outside professional dealings if it's gross enough to show moral unfitness for the office and the privilege of practicing law.
*   ***Piatt v. Abordo*, 58 Phil. 350 (1933):** Reinforced the principle that a lawyer can be disciplined for gross misconduct, not necessarily related to professional duties, that shows unfitness.
*   ***Lizaso v. Amante*, Adm. Case No. 2019, 3 June 1991, 198 SCRA 1:** Cited where a lawyer was disciplined for enticing someone to invest in a casino business and failing to return the investment, despite not being a professional legal service.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense's claim that the checks were "rediscounted" and "fully paid" through cellular phones was not substantiated with credible evidence, specifically, the absence of receipts.  The subsequent payment does not support the defense that the obligation had been settled previously via other means.
*   Respondent's insinuations of special relationships with both the complainant and another woman involved in similar transactions are viewed negatively by the Court, suggesting an attempt to deflect blame and undermine the credibility of the complainants.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case underscores that a lawyer's ethical obligations extend beyond professional duties.  Issuing bad checks, engaging in deceitful conduct, and taking advantage of one's position for personal gain constitute serious breaches of the Code of Professional Responsibility and can lead to disciplinary action, even if the conduct occurs outside the strict attorney-client relationship. The Court's reliance on established jurisprudence solidifies the principle that moral character is a continuing requirement for practicing law.
