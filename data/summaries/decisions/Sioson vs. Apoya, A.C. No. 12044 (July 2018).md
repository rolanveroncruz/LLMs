**Case:** *Martin J. Sioson vs. Atty. Dionisio B. Apoya, Jr.* A.C. No. 12044 (July 23, 2018)

**Summary:** This is a disbarment case filed by Sioson against Atty. Apoya, Jr. for professional misconduct. Sioson alleges that he engaged Atty. Apoya, Jr. to handle a petition for review before the DOJ, paying a P10,000 acceptance fee. Atty. Apoya, Jr. allegedly failed to file an Entry of Appearance or any pleading, ignored Sioson's inquiries, and refused to return the acceptance fee. Atty. Apoya, Jr. denied the attorney-client relationship.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Engagement:** Sioson claims he engaged Atty. Apoya, Jr. on November 27, 2013 for a Qualified Theft case petition review before DOJ.
*   **Fees:**  P10,000 acceptance fee paid by Sioson via BDO check and allegedly deposited by Atty. Apoya, Jr.
*   **Obligations:** Sioson alleges Atty. Apoya, Jr. agreed to file a Notice of Entry of Appearance and a manifestation, which he failed to do.
*   **Communication:** Sioson's attempts to contact Atty. Apoya, Jr. via text and letters were allegedly ignored.
*   **Defense:** Atty. Apoya, Jr. denied the attorney-client relationship and receipt of the acceptance fee, and filed counter-charges of Grave Threats and Grave Coercion against Sioson.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's findings that Atty. Apoya, Jr. violated the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Sanction:** Atty. Apoya, Jr. is suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months.
*   **Restitution:** Atty. Apoya, Jr. is ordered to return the P10,000 acceptance fee to Sioson.

**CPR Violations:**

*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Dishonest and deceitful conduct.
*   **Canon 16, Rule 16.01:** Failure to account for client's money.
*   **Canon 18, Rule 18.03:** Neglect of a legal matter.
*   **Canon 18, Rule 18.04:** Failure to keep client informed.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The core dispute revolves around whether an attorney-client relationship existed. Atty. Apoya, Jr.'s denial, despite evidence of the check deposit and correspondence, was not credible to the court.
*   **Evidence:** The Court relied on the confluence of evidence presented by Sioson, including the check, text messages, and letters. The burden of proof rested on Sioson, but was ultimately met.
*   **Defense Weakness:** Atty. Apoya, Jr.'s defense of denial was deemed "flimsy and self-serving." His failure to present corroborating witnesses (his mother and Juvy Paghel) was detrimental to his case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Referenced cases: *Rollon v. Naraval*, *Small v. Banares*, *Meneses v. Macalino*, and *Maniquiz v. Emelo* to support the imposition of sanctions for similar violations of the CPR.
*   Specific canons and rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) were cited as the basis for the disciplinary action.
