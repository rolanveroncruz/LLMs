**Case Summary: People v. Empuesto, G.R. No. 218245 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Rape under Art. 266-A 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353.

**Facts:** Accused-appellant Empuesto was charged with rape of AAA. The prosecution presented AAA's testimony, who alleged that Empuesto entered her house in the early morning hours of July 3, 2005, threatened her with a bolo, and raped her. AAA's testimony was corroborated by BBB and circumstantial evidence regarding accused-appellant's inquiry regarding AAA's husband. The defense presented an alibi, claiming Empuesto was at a wake at the time of the incident.

**RTC Ruling:** Found Empuesto guilty of rape, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering payment of civil indemnity (₱50,000).

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modifications, adding moral damages (₱50,000) and exemplary damages (₱30,000), plus 6% interest per annum from finality.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Art. 266-A 1(a) RPC (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation. The elements required for conviction are carnal knowledge and accomplishment of the act through force/intimidation.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Sentencing:** *Reclusion perpetua* for rape.
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages are awarded to the victim, plus interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Empuesto is liable for rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** Empuesto is liable to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** As with many rape cases, the credibility of the victim is crucial. The defense challenged AAA's testimony for alleged inconsistencies, but the courts found her credible.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi was deemed weak due to inconsistencies in the testimonies of the defense witnesses.
*   **Assessment of Damages:** The Supreme Court modified the damages, which is always subject to appeal and judicial discretion.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A 1(a) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Statutory basis for the rape charge.
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, 5 April 2016, 788 SCRA 331, 372-373:** Used by the SC to modify the award of damages.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 83-2015:** Protocols for using fictitious names in decisions involving victims of sexual offenses.
*   Numerous cited cases establish the principle that credibility assessment lies primarily with the trial court, and the testimony of the victim if credible is sufficient to convict accused of rape. Also, that minor inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the testimony of a rape victim can be expected.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None explicitly stated, but the interpretation of inconsistencies in testimony and the assessment of credibility are always potential points of contention.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision but modified the damages awarded following *People v. Jugueta*. Empuesto remains guilty of rape and is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay AAA ₱75,000.00 as civil indemnity, ₱75,000.00 as moral damages, and ₱75,000.00 as exemplary damages, with 6% interest per annum from finality until fully paid.
