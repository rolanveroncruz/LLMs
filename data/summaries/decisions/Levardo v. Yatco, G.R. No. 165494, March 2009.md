**Case Summary: *Levardo v. Yatco, et al.* (G.R. No. 165494, March 20, 2009)**

This case involves a dispute over two parcels of land in Binan, Laguna, formerly tenanted by Aguido and Francisco Levardo, respectively. The central issue is whether these lands are covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 (P.D. No. 27) and whether the waiver of tenancy rights executed by the Levardos are valid, thus allowing the transfer of the property to Puyat Corporation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **P.D. No. 27 Applicability:** The Court held that P.D. No. 27, decreeing the emancipation of tenants, does NOT apply because the landholdings in question are smaller than seven (7) hectares. Citing Letter of Instruction (LOI) No. 474 and DAR Memorandum, lands seven hectares or less are excluded from Operation Land Transfer (OLT) coverage unless the landowner owns other properties exceeding seven hectares or derives substantial income from urban lands.

*   **Voluntary Surrender of Tenancy:** Section 28 of R.A. No. 3844, allows the agricultural lessee to terminate the leasehold during the agricultural year for any of the following causes: x x x x (5) Voluntary surrender due to circumstances more advantageous to him and his family.

*   **Waiver Validity:** The "Pinanumpaang Salaysay" executed by both the petitioners and predecessors declared they agreed to give up their leasehold rights "dahil sa aming kagustuhang umiba ng hanap buhay ng higit ang pagkikitaan kaysa panakahan." These waivers are considered valid because they were notarized and supported by substantial disturbance compensation. The Court applied the presumption of regularity to these notarized documents.

**Obligations:**

*   **Landowner:** The landowner (Yatco) had the obligation to comply with R.A. 3844 when offering disturbance compensation.
*   **Tenant:**  The tenants (Levardos) had the obligation to prove any alleged misrepresentation or fraud in the execution of the waivers, which they failed to do.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioners (Levardos) are liable for costs.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of CLT issuance:** No Certificates of Land Transfer (CLTs) were actually issued to the tenants, reinforcing the Court's finding of non-coverage under P.D. No. 27.  The Court emphasized that even if CLTs were issued, they only establish preliminary qualification for ownership.
*   **Tenants Claims of Fraud:** The petitioners claimed fraud and misrepresentation, arguing they were unaware CLTs were issued. However, the Court found no evidence to support this and emphasized that the lands were outside P.D. No. 27 coverage regardless.
*   **Absence of Landowner Properties:** The petitioners did not sufficiently prove that the landowners owned other properties exceeding seven hectares, which could have brought the land under P.D. No. 27 coverage.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 27:**  Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants From the Bondage of the Soil
*   **Letter of Instruction No. 474:**  Clarifying P.D. No. 27 applicability to landholdings of seven hectares or less.
*   **Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Governs termination of leasehold agreements.
*   ***Antonio v. Estrella, No. L- 73319, December 1, 1989, 156 SCRA 68:** on the presumption of regularity for duly notarized documents

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court upheld the validity of the sale to Puyat Corporation. The waivers of tenancy rights were found valid and supported by disturbance compensation. The petitioners' claims were dismissed for lack of merit, primarily because the land size excluded it from P.D. No. 27 coverage. The most contentious point revolved around the alleged issuance and cancellation of CLTs, but the Court found no conclusive evidence of their issuance.
