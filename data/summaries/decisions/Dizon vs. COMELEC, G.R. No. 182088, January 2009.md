**Legal Document Summary: Dizon v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 182088)**

**Case Overview:** Roberto Dizon petitions to reverse COMELEC resolutions that dismissed his disqualification petition against Marino Morales, arguing Morales violated the three-term limit for local elective officials under Section 43(b) of the Local Government Code and Article X, Section 8 of the 1987 Constitution.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Three-Term Limit:** Dizon contends Morales served four consecutive terms (1995-1998, 1998-2001, 2001-2004, and 2004-2007) and his election in 2007 constitutes a fifth term, violating the three-term limit.
*   **Morales' Defense:** Morales argued his 1998 election was disputed (affirmed by the Supreme Court in *Rivera v. COMELEC*), creating an interruption.
*   **COMELEC Rulings:** COMELEC ruled that the *Rivera* case, disqualifying Morales during his 2004-2007 term, created a gap in service.  Also, Morales relinquished office before the end of his term, further contributing to the gap.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed Dizon's petition, affirming COMELEC's rulings. The SC recognized the disqualification from the 2004 election and the subsequent severance from office (ordered in the Rivera case), created an interruption of continuity of service with respect to the 2004-2007 term. The SC held that relinquishment of office on May 16, 2007, and the vice-mayor's assumption of the mayoralty, constituted an interruption, regardless of its length.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article X, Section 8, 1987 Constitution:** Establishes the three-term limit.
*   **Section 43(b), Local Government Code:** Restates the constitutional three-term limit.
*   ***Rivera v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 167591):**  Crucially, the SC decision that disqualified Morales mid-term, triggering the interruption.
*   ***Borja, Jr. v. COMELEC*, 356 Phil. 467 (1998):** Reiterates the three-term rule requires elected & served three consecutive terms.
*   ***Lonzanida v. COMELEC*, 370 Phil. 625 (1999):** Supports the argument that delays in electoral protests cannot be used against a candidate unless directly caused by them to extend stay in office, and notes involuntary severance from office amounts to an interruption.
*   ***Latasa v. Comelec*** Cites this case to support the interpretation of "rest period" within the context of the three-term limit.

**Key Legal Issues:**

*   **Definition of "Term" and "Consecutive":** The core dispute revolves around whether Morales' interrupted 2004-2007 term should be counted towards the three-term limit.
*   **Involuntary Interruption:** The SC affirmed that an involuntary severance, even for a brief period, can break the continuity of service.
*   **Applicability of *Rivera v. COMELEC*:** Whether the factual findings in the *Rivera* case conclusively prevent Morales from claiming an interruption.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Interruption":** While the SC ruled on the specific facts, future cases might face challenges in defining what constitutes a legitimate "interruption" vs. a strategic manipulation of the term limits.
*   **Reliance on Vice-Mayor's Assumption:** The ruling hinged on the vice-mayor actually assuming the mayoral post, introducing a factual dependency that could be exploited in similar future cases.
*   **Future Challenges:** This decision potentially opens the door for candidates to strategically create short breaks in their service to circumvent the three-term rule, relying on judicial interpretation of what constitutes a break in service.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld COMELEC's decision based on the involuntary interruption caused by the prior SC ruling in the *Rivera* case and Morales' subsequent relinquishment of office. The ruling provides some clarity on the interpretation of the three-term limit but may also introduce potential loopholes for future candidates.
