**Case Summary: Pfleider v. Court of Appeals**

**Facts:**

*   James Pfleider (Petitioner) and Marie Luise Pfleider-Alba (Respondent) are siblings and heirs of Fred and Luisa Pfleider.
*   Fred mortgaged several properties to PNB. Pfleider-Alba volunteered to represent the heirs, with an agreement for shared amortization payments. Pfleider allegedly gave Pfleider-Alba money for his share, with a receipt as evidence.
*   The properties were foreclosed. Pfleider-Alba requested a Deed of Quitclaim from Pfleider, reassuring him it wouldn't be prejudicial.
*   Later, Pfleider discovered TCT No. T-207001, consolidating Lot No. 3829 (including Pfleider's inherited portion Lot No. 3829-D), was registered solely in Pfleider-Alba's name.
*   Pfleider filed a Complaint (Civil Case No. 1287) against Pfleider-Alba and the Register of Deeds (RD) in RTC Kabankalan City, alleging fraud and violation of implied trust.
*   Pfleider-Alba moved to dismiss based on *litis pendentia*, citing Civil Case No. 00-11070 in RTC Bacolod City (Alba v. Pfleider), an action for damages and injunction.
*   RTC Kabankalan City initially denied the motion, but reconsidered and dismissed Civil Case No. 1287 based on *litis pendentia*.
*   Pfleider appealed to the CA, which dismissed the appeal for raising pure questions of law, which should have been addressed in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, not a Rule 41 appeal.
*   Pfleider now seeks certiorari under Rule 65, arguing grave abuse of discretion by the CA.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Quitclaim:** Its validity and effect are central to the dispute. Pfleider claims he signed it based on Pfleider-Alba's reassurances and alleges misrepresentation. The court has to determine if this was procured by fraud.
*   **Implied Trust:** Pfleider argues an implied trust existed between him and Pfleider-Alba, stemming from her role as representative of the heirs and her promises regarding the mortgaged properties. The facts must be ascertained to establish a legal basis for an implied trust and its potential breach.
*   **Obligations as Heir:** The siblings, as compulsory heirs, have rights and obligations regarding the inherited properties.
*   **Duties of Register of Deeds:** The RD's role in issuing the title in Pfleider-Alba's name is challenged, though the RD argues proper performance of duties.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration, and Appeals Process**: These motions form the basis for the action between the parties in the Supreme Court.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Pfleider-Alba:** Potential liability for fraud, breach of implied trust, and unjust enrichment if the court finds she acted improperly in consolidating the property in her name.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Although unlikely, potential liability if found to have acted negligently or beyond the scope of their authority, despite the argument that their action in issuing title was ministerial.
*   **Pfleider:** Risk of losing his claim to Lot No. 3829-D if the Deed of Quitclaim is deemed valid and binding, and the *litis pendentia* ruling stands.
*   **Procedural Risk:** The Supreme Court highlights that Certiorari is improper given that a Rule 45 appeal was available.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Pertains to Certiorari, which the court states is not the correct procedure in this case.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Pertains to appeals to the Supreme Court raising only questions of law
*   **Rule 41, Rules of Court:** Pertains to ordinary appeals to the Court of Appeals (questions of fact)
*   **Rule 50, Section 2, Rules of Court:** Grounds for dismissal of appeals.
*   ***Litis Pendentia***: Central legal issue. The Court cites ***Yap v. Chua, 687 Phil. 392, 400 (2012)*** and ***Development Bank of the Phils. v. CA, 387 Phil. 283, 300 (2000)*** regarding the elements and application of the doctrine, and the nature of counterclaims in relation to it.
*   **Implied Trust:** Relevant in determining whether one was established. See Art 1441-1457 Civil Code

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Validity of the Deed of Quitclaim:** The circumstances surrounding its execution are crucial. Was there actual misrepresentation or undue influence?
*   **Application of *Litis Pendentia*:** Is there truly an identity of causes of action between Civil Case No. 1287 and Civil Case No. 00-11070? Pfleider argues that TCT No. T-207001 was not yet issued when Civil Case No. 00-11070 was filed.
*   **Nature of the Appeal:** The core issue is whether the CA correctly determined that the appeal raised only questions of law.
*   **Admissibility of evidence presented**:
*   **Remedies and procedure.**

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Denies Pfleider's Petition. Affirms the CA Decision and Resolution.
*   Holds that Certiorari was an improper remedy because appeal by petition for review was available.
*   Determines that the CA did not err in dismissing the appeal because it raised purely questions of law, which are not within the CA's jurisdiction under Rule 50, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   Concludes that the RTC Kabankalan City's dismissal based on *litis pendentia* was correct, finding identity of parties and causes of action between the two cases.
