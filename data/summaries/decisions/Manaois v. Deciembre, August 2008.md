**Legal Document Summary: *Juanita Manaois vs. Atty. Victor V. Deciembre, Adm. Case No. 5364***

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Deciembre for disbarment based on willful falsification and conduct unbecoming a member of the Bar.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   Complainant (Manaois) obtained a loan through Respondent (Deciembre).
*   Complainant provided blank checks as security.
*   Complainant alleges full loan payment, but Respondent failed to return all checks.
*   Respondent filled out the remaining blank checks with amounts exceeding the original loan, presented them, and filed estafa and BP 22 cases against Complainant when dishonored.
*   IBP found Respondent guilty of tampering with checks based on credibility assessment.
*   IBP recommended 5-year suspension; Supreme Court sustains the finding of guilt but modifies the penalty.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Deciembre has an obligation to uphold the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically Canon 1, Rule 1.01 (no unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct) and Canon 7 (uphold integrity and dignity of the profession).
*   Atty. Deciembre is found liable for gross misconduct and violation of Rules 1.01 and 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Penalties:** Indefinite suspension from the practice of law.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Canon 7:**  Basis for ethical obligations of lawyers.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22):** Law violated through allegedly falsified checks, forming the basis of the criminal complaint filed by Respondent against Complainant.
*   **Marcelo v. Javier, Sr., A.C. No. 3248, 18 September 1992, 214 SCRA 1, 13:** Used in the decision to show obligation to public to uphold the law.
*   **Olbes v. Deciembre, A.C. No. 5365, 27 April 2005, 457 SCRA 341:**  Precedent case where Respondent was already indefinitely suspended for similar misconduct involving other individuals, also involving fraudulent loan practices and bad checks.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility Assessment:** The case hinges on the credibility of the witnesses. The IBP and the Supreme Court clearly found the Complainant more credible.
*   **Falsification of Documents:** The key allegation is that Respondent filled out blank checks without authorization after the loan was repaid. Proof of this falsification is critical.
*   **Dishonesty:** Respondent's conduct, even in private dealings, can impact his fitness to practice law.
*   **Pattern of Behavior:** The prior suspension in *Olbes v. Deciembre* establishes a pattern of similar misconduct, significantly strengthening the case against Respondent.

**Ambiguities or Contentious Clauses:** None apparent. The facts are straightforward, and the legal principles are well-established.
