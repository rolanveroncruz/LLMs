## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Librea*, G.R. No. 179937

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Accused, Gerald Librea, was convicted by the RTC for selling 0.04 grams of "shabu" to a poseur-buyer in a buy-bust operation.
*   The prosecution presented testimony from the buy-bust team (Novicio, Yema, Cleofe), detailing the operation and Librea's arrest.
*   Librea denied the buy-bust and claimed he was arrested while waiting for food at his aunt's store.
*   Librea admitted the authenticity and due execution of the Chemistry Report during pre-trial but denied the specimen came from him.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.

**Issues/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drug is the central issue. Specifically, the unexplained transfer of the specimen to SPO4 Mercado, who was not part of the buy-bust team, raises serious doubts about the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Non-Compliance with Sec. 21, RA 9165:** The buy-bust team failed to photograph the seized item or to have representatives from the media and DOJ sign the Inventory of Confiscated/Seized Items, as required by Section 21 of RA 9165. While *People v. Pringas* (G.R. No. 175928) holds that non-compliance is not necessarily fatal, the court emphasizes that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items must still be proven. The justification provided was the non-availability of a photographer and the lack of DOJ and media representatives at the scene.
*   **Identity of the Specimen:** The appellant challenged that the specimen tested was not what was allegedly taken from him during the buy-bust operation.
*   **Lack of Explanation:** There was a lack of explanation from the police for the specimen being handled by SPO4 D.R. Mercado, when he was not part of the buy-bust team.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Prosecution: Obligation to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing an unbroken chain of custody for seized drugs.
*   Law Enforcement: Obligation to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding the proper handling and documentation of seized drugs.
*   Accused: Alleged to be liable for violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, until proven otherwise.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Acquittal:** Due to the broken chain of custody and failure to adequately comply with Section 21 of RA 9165, the prosecution failed to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, leading to acquittal.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines the offense of selling dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Outlines the procedures for handling and documenting seized drugs in buy-bust operations.
*   ***People v. Pringas*** (G.R. No. 175928): Holds that non-compliance with Section 21 is not automatically fatal if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.
*   ***People v. Ong*** (G.R. No. 137348): Emphasizes the importance of a complete and unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of drug evidence.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The case serves as a reference for the prosecution failing to successfully prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, which is one of the core principles of the legal system.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Gerald Librea due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and the ambiguity surrounding the specimen tested.
