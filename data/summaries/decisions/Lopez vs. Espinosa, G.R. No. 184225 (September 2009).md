**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Rogelio F. Lopez and Teotima G. Lopez vs. Spouses Samuel R. Espinosa and Angelita S. Espinosa*, G.R. No. 184225, September 04, 2009 (Forcible Entry)**

**Nature:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' ruling that the Petitioners, Spouses Lopez, were liable for forcible entry and damages against the Respondents, Spouses Espinosa.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Forcible Entry:** Respondents (Espinosas) successfully demonstrated prior physical possession of a portion of land and a house built thereon since 1983. Petitioners (Lopezes) were found to have forcibly entered the property in 2002 by demolishing the house and erecting a fence while respondents were away.
*   **Title vs. Possession:** Petitioners' TCT No. T-12332, issued in 1996, covers the disputed property. However, the Court reiterates that in forcible entry cases, the *sole* issue is prior *de facto* possession, not ownership.
*   **Abandonment:** Petitioners argued Respondents abandoned the property due to disconnection of utilities and temporary relocation. The Court held that leaving valuables and padlocking the house negated any intent to abandon. "Abandonment requires (a) a clear and absolute intention to renounce a right or claim or to desert a right or property; and (b) an external act by which that intention is expressed or carried into effect." Dela Cruz v. Quiazon, G.R. No. 171961, November 28, 2008.
*   **Damages:** The lower court awarded Php85,200.00 for the value of the house and improvements, plus attorney's fees. This was affirmed, as the issue was raised for the first time on appeal.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners (Lopezes) are obligated to:
    *   Remove the concrete fence, steel gate, grills, and other structures they erected on the premises.
    *   Restore possession of the premises to Respondents (Espinosas).
    *   Pay Respondents Php85,200.00 for the value of the house and improvements.
    *   Pay litigation expenses, costs, and Php10,000.00 in attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for forcible entry and the associated damages. The court found they used "stealth and strategy" to dispossess the respondents.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation of Improvements:**  The Court affirmed the damages award, as the issue was not raised in the first appeal. However, evidence of actual damages will be necessary for execution purposes.
*   **Enforcement:** The specific definition of "premises occupied by plaintiffs previous to the forcible entry" may require further clarification during enforcement if the extent of the property is disputed.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Forcible Entry (Desahucio):** Defined, per *Dy v. Mandy Commodities Co., Inc.*, G.R. No. 171842, July 22, 2009, as deprivation of physical possession by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth. Focus is on prior *de facto* possession.
*   **TCT (Transfer Certificate of Title):** While the Lopez's held a TCT, it was not controlling in a forcible entry case. *Perez v. Falcatan, G.R. No. 139536, September 26, 2005, 471 SCRA 21, 31.*
*   **Abandonment:** *Dela Cruz v. Quiazon, G.R. No. 171961, November 28, 2008.* sets the two pronged test of abandonment.
*   **Rule on Appeal of Issues:** *Hermogenes v. Osco, G.R. No. 141505, August 18, 2005, 467 SCRA 301, 310.* This case discusses that issues not raised below cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent. The decision is fairly straightforward, but the exact boundaries to which possession must be restored might require further definition for enforcement.
