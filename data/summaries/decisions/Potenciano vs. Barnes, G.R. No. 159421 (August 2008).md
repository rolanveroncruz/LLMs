## Legal Document Summary - *Potenciano v. Barnes*, G.R. No. 159421 (2008)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision, overturning a Regional Trial Court's judgment by default.

**Key Issue:** Validity of service of summons and whether the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the defendant, Gregory P. Barnes.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over Barnes due to improper service of summons. The default judgment and subsequent orders were declared void.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Service of Summons (Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7, Rules of Court):**  Emphasizes *personal* service of summons whenever practicable. Substituted service is only permissible when personal service is impossible within a reasonable time, and requires diligent efforts to locate the defendant.
*   **Improper Service:** The deputy sheriff delivered the summons to a representative of E. Himan Law Office, who allegedly represented Barnes, without attempting personal service. This did not constitute valid personal or substituted service.
*   **Voluntary Appearance (Rule 14, Section 20, Rules of Court):** The E. Himan Law Office's initial appearance to question the Motion to Declare Defendant in Default *did not* constitute a voluntary appearance by Barnes, as they explicitly stated they were *not* yet representing him. This negates the acquisition of jurisdiction through waiver of service.
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:**  Failure to properly serve summons deprived the trial court of jurisdiction over Barnes' person, rendering all subsequent actions (default order, judgment) void. Relies on *Cavili v. Vamenta, Jr.*, 199 Phil. 528 (1982), which had similar circumstances.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Deputy Sheriff:** Obligation to properly execute service of summons, ensuring compliance with Rule 14. Failure to do so invalidates the proceedings against the defendant.
*   **Plaintiff (Potenciano):** Responsible for ensuring proper service of summons to initiate legal proceedings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Judgment:**  A judgment obtained without proper service of summons is void and unenforceable.
*   **Remedies Available to Defendant:**  The defendant (Barnes) successfully challenged the void judgment through a petition for *certiorari*, prohibition, and mandamus, nullifying the RTC proceedings and judgment.
*   **New Trial:** The case is remanded to the trial court, requiring Potenciano to properly serve summons to reinitiate the legal proceedings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case hinges on the *interpretation* of what constitutes proper "service" and "voluntary appearance" under Rule 14. The key point is that the deputy sheriff made no attempt at personal service, and the E. Himan Law office specifically stated they were not representing Barnes.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Cavili v. Vamenta, Jr.*, 199 Phil. 528 (1982):  Analogous case highlighting the importance of proper service on each defendant, and the invalidity of counsel's actions without authorization from all defendants.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 6, 7, and 20.

**Overall Assessment:** The plaintiff (Potenciano) lost this case due to a fundamental procedural flaw: failure to properly serve summons. The judgment was therefore void, and the case must be restarted with proper service.
