## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ocampo* (G.R. No. 232300, August 01, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Rose Edward Ocampo for violating Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of Article II, R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Facts:** Buy-bust operation conducted based on information regarding "alias ER" (Appellant) selling marijuana near Pinalagad Elementary School. PO1 Llacuna, as poseur-buyer, purchased marijuana from Appellant. Appellant was arrested, and additional marijuana was seized.
*   **Charges:** Violation of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession), Art. II, R.A. 9165.
*   **RTC Decision:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt on both charges.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed RTC decision, ruling warrantless arrest valid (in flagrante delicto), unbroken chain of custody established, and defense of denial/frame-up disfavored.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed CA Decision.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

1.  **Invalid Warrantless Arrest:** Argued police had time to obtain a warrant.
2.  **Doubt as to Buy-Bust:** Claimed the operation did not occur.
3.  **Compromised Evidence:** Integrity and evidentiary value of seized evidence not preserved (Chain of Custody Defect).

**Supreme Court's Rationale & Statutory References:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Upheld validity based on *in flagrante delicto* rule during a legitimate buy-bust operation, citing *People v. Rebotazo* (711 Phil. 150, 162 (2013)) and *People v. Manlangit* (654 Phil. 427, 437 (2011)). Surveillance prior to buy-bust is not essential.
*   **Guilt Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** Elements of illegal sale (Section 5, Art. II, R.A. 9165) and illegal possession (Section 11, Art. II, R.A. 9165) proven. Corpus delicti (marijuana) properly identified and presented, citing *People v. Salim Ismael y Radang*.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Analyzed under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its IRR (original provisions, as crime occurred before R.A. 10640 amendment).
*   **Section 21 Compliance:** While strict compliance not fully achieved (media refusal to sign inventory), the Court recognized justifiable grounds (media refusal) citing *People v. Angelita Reyes, et al*. (G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018) The justifiable ground can relax Section 21 compliance, the prosecution must explain reasons for procedural lapses, and the integrity and value of the seized evidence is key.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Upheld presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, absent evidence of ill motive by police, and no suggestion that police operatives deviated from their duty.
*   **Non-compliance:** Re non-compliance of police procedures, it should not affect the validity of the seizure of evidence because the issue of chain of custody is ultimately anchored on the admissibility of evidence, and is exclusively within the courts power to decide in accordance with the rules of evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The interpretation and application of "justifiable grounds" for deviations from the strict chain of custody requirements of Section 21 can be a point of contention. Here, the court accepted the refusal of media representatives to sign the inventory as a valid ground to relax the requirement. Other cases may turn on the specific facts presented to show a legitimate reason for failing to comply with Sec. 21â€™s provisions.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Heavy reliance on the presumption of regularity in police conduct can be problematic if there are indications of impropriety, even if not definitively proven.
*   **Lack of Media Signature:** This could have been seen as a red flag indicating possible irregularities. The courts affirmation of their refusal to sign could be seen as a contentious clause.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 and 11, Article II
*   R.A. No. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. 9165)
*   *People v. Rebotazo*, 711 Phil. 150, 162 (2013)
*   *People v. Manlangit*, 654 Phil. 427, 437 (2011)
*   *People v. Salim Ismael y Radang*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017.

*   Senate Journal, Session No. 80, 16th Congress, 1st Regular Session, June 4, 2014, p. 348

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, emphasizing the validity of the buy-bust operation, and affirming the trial court's assessment of the evidence. The Court applied a lenient interpretation of Section 21, acknowledging justifiable grounds for minor deviations from its requirements.
