**Legal Document Summary: *Gopio v. Bautista*, G.R. No. 205953 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding illegal dismissal and monetary claims of an OFW.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Bautista hired by Shorncliffe (PNG) Limited via Job Asia (Gopio) for 31 months at P40,000/month (alleged actual P115,850/month). Clause 4.3 permits termination by employer with 1-month notice or salary in lieu thereof ("other grounds").
*   **Termination:** Bautista terminated after 9 months based on "unsatisfactory performance," given salary for a portion of the month, and one month's pay.
*   **R.A. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):** Mandates full protection to Filipino workers, local and overseas.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Job Asia (Gopio) and Shorncliffe jointly and severally liable for claims arising from the contract as per R.A. 8042 and POEA Rules.
*   **Due Process:** Requires two written notices and hearing before termination (Art. 292(b) Labor Code, renumbered).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Bautista illegally dismissed due to lack of just cause and due process. Post-termination performance evaluations deemed afterthought evidence.
*   **Indemnity:** Employer liable for salaries for unexpired term (22 months).

**Monetary Awards & Damages:**

*   Salaries for unexpired contract term: P2,548,700.00
*   Reimbursement of placement fee with 12% interest per annum.
*   Moral Damages: P150,000.00
*   Exemplary Damages: P150,000.00
*   Attorney's Fees: 10% of monetary award (exclusive of damages and reimbursement of placement fee)

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act), Sec. 2(b), (c), Sec. 10:**  Protects migrant workers, establishes solidary liability.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 292(b) (formerly Art. 277):** Security of Tenure, procedural requirements for termination.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1306:** Freedom to contract limited by law, morals, public policy.
*   **POEA Rules and Regulations (2002):**  Licensing requirements, solidary liability of recruitment agencies.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc.*, G.R. No. 167614 (2009) and *Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v. Cabiles*, G.R. No. 170139 (2014):** Declares "three months for every year" clause in R.A. 8042 unconstitutional.
*   ***Skippers United Pacific, Inc. v. Maguad*, G.R. No. 166363 (2006):** Evidence produced after the fact not valid as an assessment of incompetence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 4.3 (Employment Contract):** Clause allowing termination on "other grounds" with 1-month notice or salary is deemed violative of security of tenure and right to due process as it is overbroad and allows for arbitrary dismissal, effectively turning the fixed term employment into one terminable at will.

**Potential Risks & Considerations:**

*   **Enforcement Against Foreign Employer:** Local agency (Gopio) bears primary liability, but may seek reimbursement from foreign employer.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Gopio as owner of Job Asia, is jointly and severally liable with Shorncliffe.
*   **Proof of Actual Salary:** The actual monthly income amount of ₱115,850.00, which is higher than the ₱40,000.00 in the contract, may raise questions about the veracity of the contract, and other potential violations, such as tax evasion and labor violations.
*   **Interest on Awards:** Monetary awards accrue interest from finality of judgment.
