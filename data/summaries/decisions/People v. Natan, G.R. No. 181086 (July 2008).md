## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Natan*, G.R. No. 181086

**Nature:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Alfredo Natan for statutory rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Statutory rape (carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years old).
*   **Age of Victim:** The victim, "Maria," was 6 years old at the time of the first incident, making this a case of statutory rape.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua. The initial death penalty imposed by the trial court was reduced by the Court of Appeals due to R.A. 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law). The Supreme Court affirmed this, noting the crime occurred *before* R.A. 7659 took effect, precluding the special aggravating circumstance for imposing the death penalty based on the victim's age being under 7.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil indemnity of P50,000.00 (mandatory).
    *   Moral damages of P50,000.00.
    *   Exemplary damages (initially awarded) were **removed** by the Supreme Court as no aggravating circumstances were proven.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Alfredo Natan is obligated to serve the sentence of reclusion perpetua and to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancies in Testimony:** The defense raised inconsistencies in the victim's testimony (who removed her panty, the exact timing of events). The Court deemed these inconsistencies minor and immaterial, relying on the consistent identification of the defendant as the perpetrator and the victim's young age which could cause her to have a testimony that is "less than letter-perfect".
*   **Age and Application of Law:** The issue regarding the applicability of R.A. 7659 (Death Penalty) required careful analysis. The crime occurred before the effectivity of the law, meaning the death penalty could not be applied on the basis of the victim being under seven years old. The Court determined the proper penalty was reclusion perpetua.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (Statutory Rape):** Defines the crime and the applicable penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:**  (Death Penalty Law) The decision explicitly states that the law doesn't apply because the act was committed before the law came into effect.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** (Anti-Death Penalty Law) Is mentioned briefly as the reason the court of appeals lowered the initial penalty of death.
*   **Article 2230 of the Civil Code** is cited for the award of exemplary damages, however the court finds no basis for the award because there were no aggravating circumstances.
*   **People v. Desuyo, G.R. No. L-71173, August 9, 1988, 164 SCRA 210.** The court used this to describe "Defilers of women."
*   **People v. Agunos, 375 Phil. 315, 326 (1999).** The court used this case to explain that rape debases a woman's dignity.
*   **People v. Sayat, G.R. Nos. 102773-77, June 8, 1993, 223 SCRA 285, 291.** Used to explain why the victim would not have a will of her own when she is so young.
*   **People v. Mayo, G.R. No. 170636, April 27, 2007.** The court used this case to explain that the time of the crime is not important but the identification of the accused is.
*   **People v. Abellera, G.R. No. 166617, July 3, 2007.** The court used this to explain why people of a young age should be taken seriously when testifying about their assault.
*   **People v. Santos, G.R. Nos. 131103 & 143472, June 29, 2000, 334 SCRA 655, 671.** The court used this to explain the Civil Indemnity and Moral damages awarded in the case.
*   **People v. Larena, 368 Phil. 614, 635-636 (1999).** The court used this to explain the difference between Civil indemnity and moral damages.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The only ambiguity revolved around inconsistencies in the victim's testimony. The Court resolved this by emphasizing the consistent identification of the perpetrator and the inherent difficulties faced by a child recounting a traumatic event. This is a common issue in such cases and the ruling aligns with prevailing jurisprudence on the credibility of child witnesses in sexual assault cases.

**Conclusion:** The decision provides a clear affirmation of the appellant's guilt for statutory rape, taking into account the applicable laws and circumstances surrounding the case, including the victim's age and the time of the offense.
