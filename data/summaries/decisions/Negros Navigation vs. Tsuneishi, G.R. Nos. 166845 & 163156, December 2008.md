**Legal Document Summary: *Negros Navigation Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Tsuneishi Heavy Industries (Cebu), Inc.* (G.R. No. 163156 & 166845)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions concerning the interplay between a corporate rehabilitation stay order and a maritime lien. G.R. No. 163156 is a petition for *certiorari* and prohibition, while G.R. No. 166845 is a petition for review on *certiorari*.

**Facts:**

*   Negros Navigation Co., Inc. (NNC), a shipping company, contracted Tsuneishi Heavy Industries (Cebu), Inc. (THI) for vessel repairs.
*   THI filed a collection suit and sought a writ of attachment against NNC in Cebu RTC (Civil Case No. CEB-29899) based on unpaid services, claiming a repairman's lien (maritime lien).
*   The Cebu RTC granted the writ of preliminary attachment.
*   NNC subsequently filed a petition for corporate rehabilitation in the Manila RTC (Special Proceeding No. 04-109532), which issued a Stay Order.
*   THI then amended its Cebu RTC complaint to include an *in rem* action against several NNC vessels, seeking their arrest and sale.
*   The Cebu RTC ordered the arrest of the vessels.
*   The Manila RTC clarified that its Stay Order encompassed *in rem* claims.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) initially issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the Manila RTC's Stay Order, but later denied THI's petition to annul the Stay Order.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Stay Order (Manila RTC):** Suspends all claims against NNC, including *in rem* claims, and prohibits the sale or encumbrance of NNC's assets outside of the ordinary course of business. Obligations: creditors are barred from pursuing claims against the corporation during rehabilitation period. The corporation must adhere to restrictions.
*   **Writ of Preliminary Attachment (Cebu RTC - Initial):**  Allows attachment of NNC's properties based on allegations of fraud in incurring the debt. Obligations: NNC has obligation to not dispose of assets.
*   **Arrest Orders (Cebu RTC - Amended Complaint - *In Rem*):** Orders the arrest of specific NNC vessels based on THI's maritime lien. Obligations: NNC has obligation to not move its vessels.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NNC:** Potential liability for unpaid repair services to THI (P104,464,000.00 plus interest and penalties). Risk of asset seizure if rehabilitation fails and THI is allowed to enforce its maritime lien.
*   **THI:** Risk of delayed recovery on its claim due to the stay order. Risk of diminished value of assets if rehabilitation is unsuccessful.
*   **Maritime Lien:**  THI's repairman's lien is a preferred maritime lien under Presidential Decree (PD) 1521 but enforcement is temporarily suspended due to the rehabilitation proceedings. Risk: The value of the liens could diminish if the vessels deteriorate during the rehabilitation process.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 1521:** Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978; governs maritime liens.
    *   Section 21:  Establishes maritime liens for repairs and necessaries, enforceable by suit *in rem*.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 902-A (as amended by RA 8799):**  Concerns corporate rehabilitation and suspension of payments.
    *   Section 6: Mandates suspension of all actions for claims against corporations under rehabilitation upon appointment of a management committee or rehabilitation receiver.
*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (RA 8799):** The Securities Regulation Code, amended Section 5 of PD 902-A, transferring jurisdiction over rehabilitation proceedings to the Regional Trial Courts.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation:**  Governs rehabilitation proceedings under PD 902-A. Section 6 defines the powers and duties of the Rehabilitation Receiver.
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court (G.R. No. 74851, December 9, 1999):**  Reaffirms the suspension of all claims upon appointment of a rehabilitation receiver, regardless of whether a creditor is secured or unsecured. Key principle: Equality in equity among creditors.
*   ***Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemos***:  Where the law does not distinguish, neither should we. Relevant to the Stay Order's broad application.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Stay Order:**  THI argued that the Stay Order should not apply to *in rem* actions against vessels. The courts clarified that the Stay Order encompasses all claims. Contentious because it impacts a secure creditors ability to realize the security it bargained for.

**Holding:**

1.  **G.R. No. 163156:** Petition dismissed as moot and academic, as the CA issued a final decision on the matter.
2.  **G.R. No. 166845:** Petition denied. The Court affirmed that the Manila RTC's Stay Order validly suspended the *in rem* proceedings in the Cebu RTC. THI's maritime lien remains valid but its enforcement is suspended pending the outcome of the rehabilitation proceedings. There is no conflict between PD 1521 and PD 902-A.
