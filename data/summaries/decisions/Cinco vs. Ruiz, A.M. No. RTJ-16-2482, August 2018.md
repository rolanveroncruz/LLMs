## Legal Document Summary: *A.M. No. RTJ-16-2482*

**Case:** Atty. Carlos D. Cinco v. Presiding Judge Alfonso C. Ruiz II, Regional Trial Court, Branch 216, Quezon City.

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against Judge Ruiz for Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Inefficiency, Gross Misconduct, and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Claims:**
    *   Undue delay (9+ months) by Judge Ruiz in resolving Plaintiff's Additional Formal Offer of Evidence (Rebuttal).
    *   Erroneous denial of Exhibits "E" and "H" to "W" attached to Plaintiff's Amended Judicial Affidavit for Rebuttal, arguing they should have been admitted because the Amended Judicial Affidavit requested their marking and the defendants waived cross-examination.
*   **Respondent's Defense:**
    *   No intention to delay; desired to give complainant opportunity to rectify the failure to mark the exhibits.
    *   Clarificatory hearing was set to allow for marking, but complainant did not attend.
    *   Plaintiff's Rejoinder asserted exhibits *should* be considered marked, instead of moving to mark them.
    *   Judge claims he lacked authority to order marking ex parte.
    *   Judge asserts the court adopted a liberal application of procedural rules in order to be able to decide the case based on the merits
*   **OCA Report:**
    *   Found Judge Ruiz guilty of Undue Delay in Rendering a Decision/Order (a less serious offense under Section 9(1), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court).
    *   Recommended admonishment, considering mitigating circumstances (first offense, good faith).

**Obligations:**

*   Judges have a duty to resolve matters with reasonable dispatch. *Ting v. Atal, 301 Phil. 82, 85 (1994)*.
* Counsel has the responsibility to properly mark exhibits during trial.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Ruiz found administratively liable for Undue Delay in Rendering a Decision/Order.
*   Initially faced potential sanctions under Section 11(B), Rule 140 (suspension or fine), but ultimately admonished.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Marking of Exhibits:** The core issue revolves around whether the request for marking exhibits within the Amended Judicial Affidavit, coupled with waiver of cross-examination, constituted sufficient grounds for admitting the exhibits despite not being formally marked during a hearing. This raises questions about the interpretation of procedural rules regarding evidence presentation and marking.
*   **Complainant's actions:** The complainant's failure to attend the clarificatory hearing and his rejoinder claiming the exhibits should have already been marked, rather than moving to mark them, arguably contributed to the delay and compounded the procedural issue.
*   **Judicial Discretion vs. Undue Delay:** Balancing judicial discretion in managing trial procedures with the obligation to timely resolve pending matters. The case highlights the tension between giving parties opportunity to correct deficiencies and avoiding unreasonable delays.
*   **No statutory references aside from the rules of court**

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, Section 9(1):** Undue delay in rendering a decision or order (Less Serious Charge).
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, Section 11(B):** Sanctions for Less Serious Charges (suspension or fine).
*   *Ting v. Atal, 301 Phil. 82, 85 (1994)* Implicates the Judge's incompetence.

**Conclusion:**

This case illustrates the importance of adhering to procedural rules regarding evidence presentation and the need for judges to resolve matters promptly. While the judge's actions were deemed to constitute undue delay, mitigating circumstances led to a less severe sanction.
