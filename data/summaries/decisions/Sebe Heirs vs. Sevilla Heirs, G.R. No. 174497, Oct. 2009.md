**Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Generoso Sebe v. Heirs of Veronico Sevilla***

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari regarding the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) versus the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) over an action for annulment of documents, reconveyance, and recovery of possession of real property. The RTC dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the assessed value of the properties was below the threshold for RTC jurisdiction. The Supreme Court upheld the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Nature of Action:** Annulment of documents (affidavits of quitclaim, deeds of confirmation of sale), reconveyance, recovery of possession, and damages related to two parcels of land.
*   **Assessed Value:** P9,910.00 (below the jurisdictional amount of P20,000.00).
*   **Plaintiff's Claim:** Spouses Sebe claimed ownership, alleging that defendant Sevilla fraudulently induced them to sign documents conveying the lots to him, rather than a mortgage. They further alleged forgery in later documents.
*   **Defendant's Claim:** Sevilla asserted that he bought the lots in a regular manner.
*   **Relief Sought:** Declaration of nullity of documents, declaration of the Sebes as lawful owners, restoration of possession, and damages.

**Legal Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** Does the RTC have jurisdiction over this action, given the assessed value of the property and the nature of the relief sought (annulment, reconveyance, and recovery of possession)? Is the action a real action or one incapable of pecuniary estimation?

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the RTCâ€™s dismissal, holding that the action is essentially a real action because the main issue is *who has the valid title to the real property*.
*   The court clarified the difference between title and certificate of title, with the core question being the rightful ownership. The action for annulment and reconveyance are consequential to the determination of rightful ownership.
*   Given the assessed value is below P20,000.00, jurisdiction lies with the MTC, as per Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by Republic Act 7601.
*   The damages claimed are incidental to the main real action and do not affect jurisdictional amount.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 19 and 33 (as amended by RA 7601):** Defines the jurisdiction of RTC and MTC based on the assessed value of real property involved in real actions.
*   **Republic Act 296 (The Judiciary Act of 1948):** Original jurisdiction over actions incapable of pecuniary estimation was under the CFI.
*   ***Spouses Huguete v. Spouses Embudo, 453 Phil. 170 (2003):*** Affirmed that actions for cancellation of title, declaration of nullity of deeds, and partition, jurisdiction depended on the valuation of the properties involved.
*   ***De Rivera v. Halili, 118 Phil. 901 (1963)*** Plaintiff's reference. The Supreme Court in the present case distinguished it from facts in the case.
*   ***Copioso v. Copioso, 439 Phil. 936, 943 (2002):*** Plaintiff's reference. Overturned by Spouses Huguete v. Spouses Embudo.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Fraud Allegations:** While the court focused on jurisdiction, the underlying fraud allegations remain unresolved. The Sebes still have the burden of proving fraudulent inducement.
*   **Unregistered Lots:** The lots were unregistered, thus, the Supreme Court was very careful to draw the distinction between *title* and *certificate of title.*
*   **Reliance on Assessed Value:** The assessed value from tax declarations is the sole determinant of jurisdiction in this case.
