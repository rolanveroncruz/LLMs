Here is a summary of the legal document, tailored for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Nazareno, et al. v. City of Dumaguete, et al.* G.R. No. 177795, June 19, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing RTC Decision dismissing Petition for Mandamus, Injunction, and Damages related to invalidated appointments.

**Facts:** Petitioners were appointed to various positions in the City Government of Dumaguete by the outgoing City Mayor Remollo shortly before the end of his term. The newly elected Mayor Perdices refused to recognize these appointments. The Civil Service Commission Field Office (CSC-FO) subsequently invalidated and revoked the appointments due to violations of CSC Resolution No. 010988 (mass appointments by outgoing officials). Petitioners appealed the CSC-FO decision, ultimately unsuccessfully, through the CSC Regional Office (CSC-RO) and the CSC Proper.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Appointments:** The central issue is the validity of the appointments made by the outgoing mayor, specifically whether they violated CSC Resolution No. 010988.
*   **Mandamus:** Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus to compel the City to pay their salaries, salary adjustments, and other emoluments from 28 September 2001 onwards.  Court denied due to lack of clear legal right given the appointments were disapproved for violations of Civil Service Law.
*   **Damages:** Petitioners claimed moral and exemplary damages based on the mayor's announcement rejecting their appointments, economic hardship, and humiliation. Court denied due to lack of evidence of bad faith.
*   **Liability for Salaries:**  The Court grappled with the issue of who is responsible for payment of salaries. It referred to Sec. 4, Rule VI of the Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Action which states when appointment has been disapproved for violation of pertinent laws, the appointing authority shall be personally liable for the salary of the appointee and to Section 65, Chapter 10, Book V, of Executive Order No. 292, otherwise known as the Administrative Code of 1987.

**Statutory References:**

*   **CSC Resolution No. 010988:** Rules and guidelines for appointments by outgoing local chief executives. Key issue is whether the appointments qualify as prohibited "mass appointments."
*   **Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions:** Specifically Section 1, Rule IV and Section 3 and 4, Rules VI concerning the effectivity of appointments, and liability of the appointing authority when appointments are disapproved.
*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Section 65, Chapter 10, Book V outlines liability of appointing authority.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   Numerous cases cited regarding mandamus requirements, the burden of proof for damages, and the prohibition of forum shopping.
* *Bunsay v. Civil Service Commission*
* *Jardeleza v. People*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of CSC Resolution No. 010988 regarding what constitutes a "mass appointment" and the circumstances under which such appointments are permissible.
*   Determination of bad faith on the part of the Mayor Perdices.
* Application of *no work, no pay*.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Personal Liability of Former Mayor Remollo:** If the Supreme Court ultimately affirms the invalidity of the appointments, the former mayor could be held personally liable for the petitioners' salaries, salary adjustments, and other emoluments. This could lead to a separate action against Remollo.
*   **Exposure to Damages:** Although the court found no evidence of bad faith, there remains a slight risk of liability depending on the Supreme Court's ultimate finding regarding the validity of the appointments and the mayor's actions.
*    In light of the court's referral to liability of the former mayor and given his passing, the case is likely to become one against his estate.

**Key Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition for certiorari and AFFIRMED the RTC decision dismissing the Petition for Mandamus and Damages. The court held that the petitioners did not have a clear legal right to the salaries as their appointments were invalidated for violating civil service law. The court also found no evidence of bad faith on the part of Mayor Perdices. The case hinged on the invalidity of the original appointments and the subsequent appeals process, which ultimately weighed against the petitioners' claims.
