**Case Summary: *People v. Lagman and Zeng Wa Shui*, G.R. No. 168695, December 8, 2008**

**Overview:** This case involves the appeal of Maribel Lagman and Zeng Wa Shui's conviction for violation of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended by R.A. 7659, specifically for possession of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) and ephedrine hydrochloride. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, modifying only the penalty due to the enactment of R.A. No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **R.A. 6425 (as amended by R.A. 7659):** Violation of Sections pertaining to possession of regulated drugs (shabu and ephedrine hydrochloride).
*   **Search Warrants (96-101 & 96-102):**  Validity of the warrants, particularly the specificity requirement for the person against whom it is directed. Maribel challenged 96-101, arguing it lacked particularity as to her. The Court found the warrant valid as it sufficiently described the place to be searched and the items to be seized.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Zeng argued that the shabu found in his vehicle was illegally obtained because it was not specified in the search warrant. The Court invoked the "plain view" doctrine, allowing the admissibility of the evidence.
*   **Constructive Possession (Maribel):**  The central issue regarding Maribel is whether she had constructive possession of the drugs found in the padlocked rooms of her rented house. The Court held that, as the tenant, she had dominion and control over the premises, creating a presumption of knowledge and possession, which she failed to rebut. *People v. Torres* (G.R. No. 170837, September 12, 2006) is cited, affirming that the finding of illicit drugs in a building occupied by a person raises a presumption of knowledge and possession.
*   **Lack of Authority to Possess (Zeng):** Zeng contested the prosecution's failure to prove he lacked authority to possess the shabu. The Court ruled that the burden shifted to Zeng to prove he possessed a license or authority, as this fact was within his peculiar knowledge. *People v. Manalo*, G.R. No. 107623, February 23, 1994, is cited.
*   **Quantitative Examination:** Zeng argued that the lack of quantitative examination of the shabu's purity invalidated the conviction. The Court rejected this, stating that the purity of the substance is irrelevant under the Dangerous Drugs Act; mere unauthorized possession is sufficient for conviction.
*   **Elements of Illegal Possession:** The Court reiterated the three elements of the crime: (1) actual possession of a prohibited drug; (2) lack of legal authorization; and (3) free and conscious possession. Cites *People v. Tira* (G.R. No. 139615, May 28, 2004).
*   **Penalty:** Initially sentenced to death, the penalty was modified to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, consistent with R.A. No. 9346.
**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellants:** Convicted of violating R.A. 6425 (as amended).
*   **State:** Successfully prosecuted the case, demonstrating the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constructive Possession (Maribel):** The finding of constructive possession is always fact-dependent. The Court placed significant weight on her tenancy and lack of plausible explanation for the locked rooms.
*   **Plain View Doctrine (Zeng):** Application of the plain view doctrine is highly fact-specific and relies on the lawful presence of law enforcement. The prior justification for the intrusion (the search warrant for the piggery) was crucial in justifying the seizure from Zeng's van.
*   **Lack of Quantitative Testing:** While the Court dismissed this argument here, challenges based on the integrity and handling of drug evidence (chain of custody) are common in drug cases and can be viable if irregularities are present.
*   **Reliance on Field Tests:** While the NBI Chemist tested the liquid substance on the spot, there is little information on if there was a more thorough analysis conducted.
