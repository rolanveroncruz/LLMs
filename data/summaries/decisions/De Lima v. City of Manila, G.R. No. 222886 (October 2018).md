Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted in markdown, focusing on key legal points:

**Case:** *Hon. Leila M. De Lima v. City of Manila*, G.R. No. 222886, October 17, 2018.  (842 Phil. 407)

**Subject Matter:** Validity of Manila City Ordinance No. 8331 (2013 Omnibus Revenue Code) Section 104, imposing percentage tax on gross sales of retailers. Specifically, the question is if the rates exceed the limitation imposed under Section 191 of the Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Hon. Leila M. De Lima, Secretary of Justice (acting on appeal by retail business operators).
*   **Respondent:** City of Manila, represented by Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada.

**Background:**

Retail business operators appealed Ordinance No. 8331, Section 104 to the Secretary of Justice, claiming it was unconstitutional and illegal because it exceeded the 10% limit on tax rate increases under Section 191 of the LGC and violate Section 5 Article X of the Constitution, and contrary to Sections 130, 186 of the LGC. The Secretary of Justice declared Section 104 void. The City of Manila then filed a "Petition for Review Ad Cautelam" in the RTC which the RTC dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The City of Manila then appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA). The CA set aside the RTC's dismissal and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Secretary of Justice appealed the CA's decision to the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **LGC Section 143:** Grants municipalities the power to impose taxes on businesses, including retailers.
*   **LGC Section 151:** Allows cities to levy taxes, fees, and charges that provinces or municipalities may impose, with certain rate limitations.
*   **LGC Section 187:** Procedure for appealing tax ordinances to the Secretary of Justice and then to a court of competent jurisdiction. Sets strict timelines.
*   **LGC Section 191:** Limits the authority of LGUs to adjust tax rates to no more than 10% every five years, which is the crux of the dispute.
*   **Issue 1 (Procedural):** Did the CA err in ruling that the RTC had jurisdiction to resolve the appeal from the Secretary of Justice? The SC held that the appeal before the RTC was timely filed but the RTC was the improper venue.
*   **Issue 2 (Procedural):** Did the City of Manila engage in forum shopping by filing the Petition for Review *Ad Cautelam* while its Motion for Reconsideration was pending before the Secretary of Justice? The Court found that the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration was ineffectual as the jurisdiction over the appeal belongs to courts of competent jurisdiction, therefore the City of Manila cannot be adjudged guilty of forum shopping.
*   **Issue 3 (Substantive):** Is Section 104 of Ordinance No. 8331 valid, considering the limitations of Section 191 of the LGC? The Court deemed that Section 104 goes beyond the 10% limitation on adjustment mandated by the LGC.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision remanding the case to the RTC. Instead, the Court ruled on the merits.

*   The Court **declared Section 104 of Ordinance No. 8331 NULL and VOID insofar as it imposes a tax rate exceeding 2.20% on gross receipts/sales amounting to Php 50,000.00 up to Php 400,000.00.**
*   The Court clarified that while the LGC grants LGUs the power to tax, it sets minimum/maximum rates and any increase must comply with Section 191's 10% limit every five years, from the enactment of the ordinance sought to be adjusted. Failure to adjust within the period allows future adjustment, but the basis remains the prevailing tax rate.
*   The Court further held that while the time interval between ordinance no. 7807 and ordinance no. 8331 is 20 years, it does not justify the accumulation of allowable increase and then their subsequent one-time imposition.

**Reasoning and Legal Analysis:**

*   The Court analyzed that the actions of the Secretary of Justice evaluating the legality of a local revenue ordinance are quasi-judicial in nature, meaning it is a subject of appeal through petition for review under Rule 43.
*   The Court found that resort to certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is proper to question actions of quasi-judicial agencies but the proper venue is the CA.
*   The Court found that the first element for the application of Section 191 is met because the City of Manila has already imposed tax in accordance with the provisions of LGC when it enacted Ordinance No. 7794 and its amendment passed two months thereafter – Ordinance No. 7807. The second element is also met with the enactment of Ordinance No. 8331, which amended the retail tax to be imposed.
*   The Court cited *Reyes v. CA* (378 Phil. 232 (1999)) for the importance of compliance with Section 187’s timelines.
*   The Court also cited *Mindanao Shopping Destination Corporation v. Duterte* (G.R. No. 211093, June 6, 2017) regarding the two elements to consider when applying Section 191.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The five-year adjustment period is not a single event, but rather the decision of whether or not to exercise such option falls upon the LGU.
*   While the LGUs are granted wide latitude to determine classification, tax base, tax rate and its corresponding increase, the powers of the LGU must be exercised in accordance with fundamental principles set forth under Section 130 of the LGC and subjected to the common limitations found under Section 133 and specific restrictions under Section 186 of the same code.
*   Future disputes could arise regarding the interpretation and application of the 10% limitation, specifically regarding how to calculate the adjustment when multiple tax classifications exist.
