**Case Summary: *Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System v. ESM Trading Corporation*, G.R. No. 159740 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of MWSS's petition for certiorari, which sought to overturn the trial court's grant of execution pending appeal.

**Background:**

*   ESM Trading Corporation (ESM) sued MWSS for nullification of a public bidding and damages, alleging it suffered losses when MWSS awarded a contract to Consuelo Commodities, Inc. (CCI).
*   The trial court ruled in favor of ESM, awarding actual, moral, and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees, against MWSS and its officers, jointly and severally. CCI was absolved due to insufficient evidence.
*   ESM moved for execution pending appeal, which the trial court granted. MWSS appealed the trial court's decision and filed a petition for certiorari against the execution.
*   The CA dismissed MWSS's certiorari petition, prompting the present petition to the Supreme Court (SC).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Award of Damages:** The trial court initially awarded damages to ESM, including:
    *   Actual damages: US$65,080 (converted to Philippine Pesos at the 1995 exchange rate) plus legal interest from January 1995.
    *   Moral damages: P500,000.00 to Emilio S. Mendoza.
    *   Exemplary damages: P200,000.00 to Emilio S. Mendoza.
    *   Attorney's fees: P100,000.00.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** MWSS and its officers were held jointly and severally liable for the damages (excluding attorney's fees).
*   **Execution Pending Appeal:** The trial court granted ESM's motion for execution pending appeal, leading to the garnishment of MWSS funds.

**Liabilities:**

*   The trial court imposed significant monetary liabilities on MWSS and its officers, particularly concerning the actual damages pegged to a USD amount and accumulating interest. The joint and several nature of the liability exposed individual officers to the full extent of the damages.
* MWSS faced immediate financial losses due to the writ of execution.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Propriety of Execution Pending Appeal:** The central issue was the correctness of the trial court's decision to allow execution pending appeal. This is governed by Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, which requires "good reasons" to justify immediate execution. MWSS argued the trial court failed to establish sufficient "good reasons".
*   **Basis for Damages:** The basis for the actual, moral, and exemplary damages awarded by the trial court. MWSS likely argued that the evidence presented by ESM was insufficient to justify such awards.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Governs execution pending appeal and requires "good reasons" for its allowance. This is a crucial point of contention.
*   **Principles of Damages:** The rules and jurisprudence regarding the recovery of actual, moral, and exemplary damages would be relevant in evaluating the trial court's decision.
*   **Government Procurement Law (RA 9184):** Although not explicitly mentioned, this law might be relevant as it governs public biddings.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court ultimately **DENIED** MWSS's petition.
*   The CA decision dismissing MWSS's certiorari petition was set aside because the **CA reversed the trial court's decision** in the main case (CA-G.R. CV No. 74964). The reversal nullified the basis for the execution pending appeal, rendering the issue moot.

**Implications:**

The SC decision was based on the appellate court's ruling in a related case which had reversed the award of damages to ESM, thus mooting the issue on the validity of the execution pending appeal.
