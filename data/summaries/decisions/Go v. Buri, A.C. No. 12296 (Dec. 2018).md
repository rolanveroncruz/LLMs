**Legal Document Summary: *Pia Marie B. Go v. Atty. Grace C. Buri*, A.C. No. 12296 (2018)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Grace C. Buri based on a complaint by Pia Marie B. Go regarding mishandling of a marriage annulment case.

**Key Provisions/Obligations Violated (CPR):**

*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Engaging in dishonest/deceitful conduct by misrepresenting the filing and status of the annulment petition.
*   **Canon 15:** Failing to observe candor, fairness, and loyalty in dealings with client.
*   **Canon 16, Rules 16.01 & 16.03:** Failure to account for and return client funds upon demand, particularly the P188,000 in legal fees.
*   **Canon 18, Rule 18.03:** Neglecting a legal matter entrusted (failure to file the annulment petition), exposing Atty. Buri to liability.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   **Suspension:** Two (2) years from the practice of law. *Jinon v. Jiz*, 705 Phil. 321 (2013) and *Agot v. Rivera*, 740 Phil. 393 (2014) cited as precedent for similar penalties in cases involving failure to return legal fees and neglect of entrusted legal matters.
*   **Restitution:** Ordered to return P188,000 to complainant, rationalized as directly linked to the professional engagement (legal fees), distinguishing it from purely civil liabilities arising from separate transactions. *Dongga-as v. Cruz-Angeles, 792 Phil. 611 (2016)*.
*   **Fine:** P5,000 for failure to comply with IBP-CBD directives.
*   **Warning:** Stern warning against repetition of similar acts, with threat of more severe penalties.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Compliance with Restitution:** Failure to return the P188,000 within 90 days will result in more severe penalties, potentially including disbarment.
*   **Effective Date of Suspension:** Obligation to report date of receipt of the Decision to the Court to determine the start date of the suspension. Failure to do so could be construed as further disobedience to the Court.
*   **Due Process:** Although the IBP-CBD made efforts to notify respondent, any subsequent challenge based on lack of due process is likely foreclosed due to respondent's waiver by non-appearance and non-compliance with IBP-CBD directives.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Specific canons and rules cited above.
*   **Jurisprudence:** *Jinon v. Jiz* and *Agot v. Rivera* regarding the appropriate penalty for similar violations. *Dongga-as v. Cruz-Angeles* clarifies the scope of disciplinary proceedings regarding restitution of funds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   No particularly ambiguous clauses are identified. The facts are straightforward, with clear violations of the CPR. The main point of contention was the respondent's failure to participate and comply with the IBP-CBD proceedings.
