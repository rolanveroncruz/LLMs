**Legal Document Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Gregorio Capulong*, G.R. No. 181790**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the liability of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to a lot buyer (Capulong) after DBP foreclosed on a loan secured by a mortgage on a real estate development project.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan & Mortgage:** DBP granted a loan to Asialand Development Corporation (ADC) secured by a mortgage on the project site before the subdivision into individual lots.
*   **Sale to Capulong:** ADC subsequently sold lots to Capulong via a Contract to Sell. Capulong fully paid but did not receive titles.
*   **Foreclosure & Transfer:** ADC defaulted, DBP foreclosed, and later transferred the assets to Asset Privatization Trust (APT) (later Property Management Office/PMO).
*   **HLURB Complaint:** Capulong filed a complaint with HLURB against ADC, DBP, and PMO seeking titles or replacement lots due to ADC's violations of PD 957.
*   **HLURB Decision:** HLURB initially ruled in favor of Capulong, declaring the foreclosure null and void, ordering transfer of titles or replacement, and awarding damages against all three parties.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the HLURB decision finding DBP liable but deleted the award of excess payments for DBP and PMO and damages for PMO

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **ADC:** Primarily liable for violating PD 957 by selling lots without HLURB approval and failing to inform Capulong of the mortgage.
*   **DBP:** Held partially liable due to its failure to exercise due diligence in granting the loan to ADC, especially considering the property was intended for real estate development and was therefore required to conduct a thorough investigation regarding buyers and contracts with buyers before the loan was granted.
* **Capulong:** is entitled to release of the transfer certificates of title over the purchased realties or the replacement thereof.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **PD 957 Violation:** ADC's violation of PD 957 (failure to obtain HLURB approval for the mortgage and failure to inform buyers) exposes them to liability.
*   **Mortgagee in Bad Faith:** DBP was not deemed an innocent mortgagee due to its lack of diligence in investigating potential buyers.
*   **Title Disputes:** The foreclosure, the subsequent transfers, and the unresolved title issues create uncertainty and potential for further litigation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Far East Bank & Trust Co. v. Marquez***: Distinguished based on the timing of the contract to sell relative to the mortgage, but still informs the due diligence required of a mortgagee when the property is part of a real estate development project.
*   ***Santiago v. Court of Appeals***: Upheld that damages must be set forth in an order or a decision.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):** Specifically Section 18, regarding mortgage requirements.
*   **Proclamation No. 50:** Creates the Asset Privatization Trust (APT).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of DBP's due diligence obligations, as a mortgagee, to investigate potential buyers of subdivision lots.
*   The appropriate remedies for Capulong, given the property's complex history and transfer to other entities.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court partially granted DBP's petition by deleting the awards of moral damages, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees to Capulong, affirming the remainder of the CA decision holding DBP liable for its failure to exercise due diligence.
