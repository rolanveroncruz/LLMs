**Case Summary: Multi-Trans Agency Phils. Inc. vs. Oriental Assurance Corp. (G.R. No. 180817, June 23, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed with modification the RTC's decision holding Multi-Trans liable for a cargo shortage.

**Facts:** Oriental, as subrogee of Imrex Enterprises, sued Multi-Trans and Neptune for the loss of one pal/box of Opacolor during shipment from England to Manila.  The shipment was insured by Oriental. Imrex filed a claim with respondent for the value of the one box that was shortlanded. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of Marine Insurance Policy No. OAC-M-96/688, respondent paid Imrex Enterprises the amount P256,937.03, for which reason, it claims that it is subrogated into the rights of Imrex Enterprises to be indemnified by petitioner and Neptune.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Breach of Contract of Carriage:** Oriental alleged negligence by Multi-Trans and Neptune in failing to deliver the complete shipment, constituting a breach of contract of carriage.
*   **Subrogation:** Oriental, having paid Imrex's claim under a marine insurance policy (OAC-M-96/688), claimed subrogation rights to recover from Multi-Trans and/or Neptune.
*   **Liability of Multi-Trans:** The core issue is whether Multi-Trans, as an alleged agent of the vessel "Tokyo Bay" (the initial carrier), is liable for the loss. Multi-Trans contests this, arguing it was only the agent of a multimodal transport operator (Transtainer Systems), not the vessel itself.
*   **Default Judgment:** Multi-Trans was declared in default due to its former counsel's failure to file an answer after its motion to dismiss was denied. A motion for new trial was subsequently denied by the trial court.
*   **Gross Negligence of Counsel:** A central argument is that Multi-Trans's former counsel exhibited gross negligence amounting to a "betrayal" of the client's interests, warranting a new trial.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Trial Court Decision:** The RTC initially held Multi-Trans and Neptune jointly and severally liable for P256,937.03 plus legal interest and attorney's fees.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The CA modified the ruling, holding only Multi-Trans liable. This ruling is now under review.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Agency Relationship:** Establishing the precise agency relationship of Multi-Trans and whether it acted as agent for the vessel itself is critical. The bill of lading (Exh. K) identifies John Goods & Sons (London) as the issuer, who, per Multi-Trans, is agent for Transtainer Systems (UK) Ltd., a multimodal transport operator.
*   **"Said to Contain" Clause:** Neptune invoked the "Said to Contain" and "Shipper's Load and Count" basis of the bill of lading, arguing it had no knowledge of the contents. This impacts the burden of proof regarding the quantity shipped.
*   **Negligence of Counsel vs. Client Responsibility:** The court needs to determine if the negligence of counsel can be imputed to the client, as the rule that negligence binds client has exceptions where the client's due process rights were violated.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The Supreme Court found that Multi-Trans was deprived of due process due to the gross negligence of its former counsel.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 37, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:**  Grounds for a new trial, specifically excusable negligence.
*   **Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA):** Neptune's answer invokes this Act in limiting liability.
*   **Tan v. Court of Appeals, 341 Phil. 570, 582 (1997):** Cited by the Petitioner, this case supported granting a motion for a new trial after the counsel had failed to file an answer and the client had been declared in default.
*   **Apex Mining, Inc. v. Court of Appeals 377 Phil. 482, 495-496 (1999):** This reiterates the client should not suffer due to the counsel's dereliction of duty.
*   **National Bookstore, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 428 Phil. 235, 245 (2002):** Gross negligence defined.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The precise identity of who Multi-Trans represents is ambiguous and central to its liability.
*   The record does not fully elaborate the nature of the "multimodal transport operator" and its relationship with the vessel.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, setting aside the CA decision and remanding the case to the RTC for a new trial. The RTC was directed to admit Multi-Trans's answer and receive its evidence. The Supreme Court also required the counsel to show cause as to why he should not be held liable for his omissions.
