## Legal Document Summary: Sta. Catalina v. People (G.R. No. 167805)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming Court of Appeals conviction of Petitioner for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Private Complainant Ballecer entrusted Petitioner with P100,000.00 for opening a Letter of Credit to import jute sacks. A document acknowledging this obligation was executed. When the transaction failed, Petitioner failed to return the funds despite repeated demands, instead using them for other expenses. Petitioner alleges the funds were for office expenses. Complainant later filed an Affidavit of Desistance.

**Key Provisions & Elements of Estafa:**

*   **Article 315, par. 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Estafa with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence.
*   **Elements of Estafa (Art. 315, par. 1(b)):**
    *   Receipt of money in trust/obligation to return.
    *   Misappropriation or conversion.
    *   Prejudice to the owner.
*   The Court found all elements present based on the evidence and Petitioner's admission of issuing checks.
*   A document was produced wherein the defendant promised to return the amount of P100,000 should the importation transaction fail to materialize

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To use the P100,000 for the specific purpose of opening the Letter of Credit *or* to return it if the transaction failed.
*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Criminal liability for Estafa, including imprisonment (indeterminate penalty of 2 years, 11 months and 11 days of *prision correccional* as minimum to 15 years of *reclusion temporal* as maximum) and civil indemnity of P100,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Missing Transcript:** Petitioner argued the trial court decision was flawed due to a missing transcript of stenographic notes. The Supreme Court ruled this was not fatal, as the decision referenced the testimony and sufficient other evidence supported the conviction, citing *People v. Derpo, Nos. L-41040 & 43908-10, December 14, 1988*.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Complainant's Affidavit of Desistance was deemed insufficient to warrant dismissal, as it was filed post-judgment. The Court referenced *People v. Ramirez Jr., G.R. Nos. 150079-80, 10 June 2004*, and *Victoriano v. People of the Philippines, G.R. Nos. 171322-24, November 30, 2006* to establish that an Affidavit of Desistance alone cannot warrant a dismissal of a case.
*   **Conflict in Cost of Goods:** Complainant cancelled the transaction upon finding a higher cost for the jute sacks.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315, paragraph 1(b):** Definition of Estafa.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 36, Section 1:** Requirements for Judgments.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *Lee v. People, G.R. No. 157781, April 11, 2005*;  *People v. Derpo, Nos. L-41040 & 43908-10, December 14, 1988*; *Alonte v. Savellano, Jr., G.R. No. 131652, March 9, 1998*; *People v. Ramirez Jr., G.R. Nos. 150079-80, 10 June 2004*; *Victoriano v. People of the Philippines, G.R. Nos. 171322-24, November 30, 2006*.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   Whether the missing transcript materially prejudiced Petitioner's defense. The Court found it did not.
*   Whether the Affidavit of Desistance merited dismissal of the case. The Court held it did not, as it was filed after judgment.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appealsâ€™ conviction of Petitioner for Estafa, finding that all elements of the crime were present and proven. Arguments regarding the missing transcript and the Affidavit of Desistance were deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction.
