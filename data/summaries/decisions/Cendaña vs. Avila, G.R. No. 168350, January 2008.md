## Legal Document Summary: Cendaña v. Avila, G.R. No. 168350 (2008)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution denying a petition for review on certiorari, affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a petition for certiorari concerning a Regional Trial Court's (RTC) grant of a writ of preliminary injunction in a *quo warranto* case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Appointment Dispute:** Centers on competing claims to the position of Director II of the LTO's Law Enforcement Service. Avila held the position and was later replaced by Cendaña's presidential appointment.
*   **RTC Injunction:** RTC granted a writ of preliminary injunction preventing Cendaña from assuming the position, pending resolution of Avila's *quo warranto* petition.
*   **CA Dismissal:** Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed Cendaña's petition for certiorari challenging the RTC's injunction order.
*   **SC Affirmance:** Supreme Court (SC) affirms the CA's dismissal, citing procedural flaws.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Cendaña's Obligations:** Cendaña was obligated to comply with procedural rules in filing his petition for certiorari. He was also required to properly challenge the RTC order.
*   **RTC's Authority:** The RTC had the authority to issue a preliminary injunction if it found sufficient basis under the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Appointment:** The primary issue centers on the validity of Cendaña's appointment, potentially raising questions of security of tenure of Avila.
*   **Procedural Rigidity:** The SC's strict interpretation of procedural rules could be seen as prioritizing form over substance, potentially delaying resolution of the underlying issue of who rightfully holds the LTO Director position.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for certiorari, including requirements for content and filing. Specifically, Sections 1 and 3 of Rule 46, and 1 of Rule 65 concerning content of petition, including addresses.
*   **Rule 46, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Details the requirements for contents and filing, and the effect of non-compliance, which is sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition.
*   **Quo Warranto:** Avila's action questions the right of Cendaña to hold the public office.
*   *Bukluran ng Manggagawa sa Clothman Knitting Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 158158 (2005):  Establishes the mandatory nature of including actual addresses in a petition for certiorari.
*   *Quintano v. National Labor Relations Commission*, G.R. No. 144517 (2004): Failure to manifest willingness to post a bond only results in the denial of injunctive relief.
*   *Abraham v. National Labor Relations Commission*, G.R. No. 143823 (2001): Sets out exceptions to motion for reconsideration requirement prior to certiorari.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The SC highlights that while the failure to manifest willingness to post a bond wasn't a fatal defect *per se*, the CA still correctly dismissed the petition for failure to file a motion for reconsideration.  The application of exceptions to the motion for reconsideration requirement could be debated.

**Conclusion:**

The SC denied Cendaña's petition based on procedural deficiencies: (1) failure to state the actual addresses of parties and (2) failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the RTC order. While the merits of the *quo warranto* case were not addressed, the resolution highlights the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules in pursuing legal remedies, specifically petitions for *certiorari*.
