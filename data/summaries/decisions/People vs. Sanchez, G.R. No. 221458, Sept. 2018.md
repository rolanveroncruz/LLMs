## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sanchez*, G.R. No. 221458

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Marcelo Sanchez y Calderon of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act) due to reasonable doubt in establishing the chain of custody of the seized drug.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. 9165 (illegal sale of 0.06 gram of shabu).
*   **Elements of Illegal Sale:** The Court reiterated the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, requiring proof of (1) buyer-seller identity, object and consideration of the sale, and (2) delivery and payment. *People v. Ismael, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017.*
*   **Chain of Custody:** The *corpus delicti* in drug cases is the seized substance; its integrity and identity must be preserved. The chain of custody rule, as defined by Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002, ensures this.
*   **Broken Chain of Custody:** The Court found a critical break in the chain of custody due to a discrepancy in the marking of the seized item. The poseur-buyer, PO1 Ignacio, testified to marking the sachet with only his initials "AI." However, the Joint Affidavit of Arrest, Inventory of Seized Items, Initial Laboratory Report, Request for Laboratory Examination, and Chemistry Report all indicated the marking as "AI-MS."
*   **Marking Inconsistency and Case Law:** The Court cited *People v. Garcia, 599 Phil. 416 (2009)*, which highlighted how inconsistencies in markings can create reasonable doubt regarding the identity of the *corpus delicti*. The prosecution failed to reconcile this discrepancy, making the chain of custody questionable.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving each link in the chain of custody beyond reasonable doubt, from seizure to presentation in court. Failure to do so compromises the integrity of the evidence. *People v. Gayoso, G.R. No. 206590, March 27, 2017.*
*   **Apprehending Officer's Role:** The apprehending officer's role in marking the seized item is critical, as it serves as the starting point for all subsequent handling of the evidence.
*   **Importance of Marking:** The value of marking the evidence is to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time of seizure from the accused until disposition at the end of criminal proceedings, obviating switching, "planting" or contamination of evidence.*People v. Enriquez, 718 Phil 352, 367 (2013).*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancy in Markings:** The core risk lies in the unexplained discrepancy between PO1 Ignacio's testimony (marking with "AI") and the documentary evidence ("AI-MS"). This creates a reasonable doubt that the presented evidence was the same item seized from the appellant.
*   **Weak Prosecution Argument:** The prosecution's argument that the discrepancy was trivial, especially when the accused was not able to raise it during the trial is not enough to justify a conviction since it involves the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Chain of Custody Loopholes:** The case highlights the importance of meticulous documentation and testimony regarding the chain of custody in drug cases. Any gap or inconsistency, especially regarding the initial marking, can lead to acquittal.
*   **Implications:** This ruling reinforces the strict application of the chain of custody rule and underscores the need for accurate and consistent evidence handling procedures in drug-related prosecutions.
