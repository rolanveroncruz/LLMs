**Legal Document Summary: *Lucasan v. PDIC*, G.R. No. 176929 (2008)**

**Nature of Document:**  Supreme Court Decision affirming the dismissal of a Petition for Declaratory Relief (quieting of title) filed by Inocencio Lucasan against the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), as receiver and liquidator of Pacific Banking Corporation (PBC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan and Default:** Lucasan obtained a loan from PBC, defaulted, and PBC obtained a judgment against him in Civil Case No. 12188.
*   **Execution Sale:**  A writ of execution was issued, and Lucasan's properties (Lot Nos. 1500-A and 229-E covered by TCT Nos. T-68115 and T-13816) were sold at public auction to PBC on May 13, 1981, and the sale was registered on June 5, 1981.
*   **Redemption Period:** Lucasan failed to redeem the properties within the one-year redemption period under the 1964 Rules of Court.
*   **PDIC as Receiver:**  PDIC became PBC's receiver and liquidator.
*   **Attempted Reacquisition:**  Lucasan, in 1997, sought to cancel the certificate of sale and offered to pay PBC's claim, which PDIC rejected, offering instead a public bidding at a significantly higher appraised value.
*   **Petition for Declaratory Relief:**  Lucasan filed a petition for declaratory relief in Civil Case No. 02-11874, seeking cancellation of the notice of embargo and certificate of sale, which was dismissed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA and SC.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Lucasan's Obligation:** Original obligation to pay the judgment debt from Civil Case No. 12188.  He argues that the PDIC's demand to repurchase the properties are unjust in light of the original debt.
*   **PDIC's Obligation:** As receiver and liquidator, PDIC's duty is to manage and dispose of PBC's assets. The court found it has no obligation to allow Lucasan to repurchase property that has already gone to auction and the redemption period has passed.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lapse of Redemption Period:**  The primary risk is Lucasan's failure to redeem within the prescribed period, extinguishing his right to the property.
*   **Lack of Legal/Equitable Title:** SC held that the plaintiff/Lucasan does not have a legal or equitable title to property as a necessary ingredient to maintain an action for quieting of title.
*   **Failure to Impeach Validity of Sale:** Lucasan failed to challenge the validity of the execution sale. This prevents him from successfully assailing the certificate of sale.
*   **Equity/Unjust Enrichment:** Argument that Lucasan would be unjustly enriched if he was allowed to repurchase the properties for a small fraction of their current appraised value.
*   **PDIC's Appraisal Value:** Raises an equity argument, but ultimately the court does not find PDIC's asking price unjust or unreasonable.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 63, Rules of Court (Quieting of Title):**  Cited regarding the requirements for an action to quiet title.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 75:** Discussed regarding the procedure for obtaining a new certificate of title after the expiration of the redemption period. The SC noted that, after the sale, Lucasan could have filed an action impeaching or annulling such proceedings prior to the issuance of the new certificate of title.
*   ***Cometa v. Court of Appeals*** **(404 Phil. 107 (2001)):** Distinguised from this case. In Cometa, the registered owner assailed the validity of the levy and sale. SC held that Lucasan didn't challenge this in the instant case. Also, *Cometa* involved a Petition for issuance of a writ of possession and cancellation of *lis pendens*.
*   ***Calacala v. Republic*** **(G.R. No. 154415, July 28, 2005):** Discussed the effect of failure to redeem property within the redemption period.
*   ***De Robles v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. No. 128053, June 10, 2004):** Differentiated between redemption (by force of law) and repurchase (discretionary), clarifying that after the redemption period, the purchaser has no obligation to resell.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Issues:**

*   **Discretion in Setting Repurchase Price:** The determination of a fair repurchase price after the redemption period had expired. PDIC has discretion to set this, and the court did not find it unjust or unreasonable.
*   **Nature of Rights After Redemption Period:** The nature of Lucasan's rights (if any) to the property after failing to redeem within the stipulated timeframe.  Court consistently held that Lucasan's rights were extinguished upon failure to redeem.
*   **Applicability of *Cometa* and Similar Cases:** Lucasan argued for a liberal construction of redemption laws, which was rejected by the court because, unlike in cited cases, no valid tender was made within the original redemption period.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed the dismissal of Lucasan's complaint for quieting of title, finding that he lacked the requisite legal or equitable title to the property and failed to demonstrate the invalidity or inoperability of the notice of embargo and certificate of sale. This decision underscores the importance of adhering to statutory redemption periods and the limited remedies available to a judgment debtor who fails to redeem property sold at public auction within the prescribed timeframe.
