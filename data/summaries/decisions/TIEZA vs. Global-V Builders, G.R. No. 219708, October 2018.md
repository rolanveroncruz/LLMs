**Legal Document Summary: *Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority v. Global-V Builders Co.* (G.R. No. 219708)**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) over a dispute involving government infrastructure projects, validity of negotiated procurement, and propriety of awarded damages.

**Background:**

*   Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA), later replaced by Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA), entered into five Memoranda of Agreement (MOA) with Global-V Builders Co. for various construction projects (sidewalks, drainage, fencing) in Boracay and Banaue between 2007 and 2008.
*   Some projects were procured through competitive bidding, others through negotiated procurement pursuant to Section 53 of R.A. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act).
*   Global-V filed a Request for Arbitration with CIAC, seeking payment for unpaid bills, interest, and damages. TIEZA filed a Refusal of Arbitration, arguing lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MOAs:** Establish contractual obligations for construction projects. Implicitly incorporate provisions of R.A. 9184, including dispute resolution mechanisms.
*   **R.A. 9184, Section 59:** Mandates arbitration for disputes arising from the implementation of contracts covered by the Act. Disputes within CIAC's competence shall be referred thereto. **Contention:** TIEZA argued that this section requires explicit incorporation of the arbitration process into the contract.
*   **Executive Order (E.O.) 1008, Section 4:** Grants CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from construction contracts, *provided* the parties agree to submit to voluntary arbitration.
*   **CIAC Rules (Sections 2.1, 2.3, 4.1):** CIAC has jurisdiction if an arbitration agreement exists, either in the contract or via subsequent agreement. An arbitration clause is deemed an agreement to submit to CIAC. **Contention:** TIEZA argues that the MOAs lack a valid arbitration agreement.
*   **General Conditions of Contract (GCC), Clause 20.2:** Included in some MOAs. States disputes shall be submitted to arbitration, provided the arbitration process is incorporated into the contract. **Contention:** TIEZA argues non-incorporation renders the arbitration clause ineffective.

**Liabilities & Damages Awarded to Global-V:**

*   **Principal Award:** P10,178,440.17 (Various projects, minus the Stamped Concrete Sidewalk and Installation of Streetlights Project, where Global-V lacked authority to claim).
*   **Cost of Arbitration:** Borne by TIEZA (P322,897.58).
*   **Interest:** 6% per annum from finality of the award until full payment.
*   **Attorney's fees**: Awarded due to TIEZA's bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** TIEZA's primary argument is the lack of a valid arbitration agreement in the MOAs, specifically that the "process of arbitration" was not incorporated as a provision in the contracts.  This challenges the CIAC's jurisdiction under E.O. 1008 and R.A. 9184.  *Hutama-Rsea Joint Operations, Inc. v. Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corp.* (G.R. No. 180640) is cited, stating the *mere existence* of an arbitration clause is sufficient for CIAC jurisdiction, but TIEZA argues this is not a valid or present arbitration clause.
*   **Negotiated Procurement Validity:** TIEZA argues that the negotiated procurement of certain contracts did not comply with the requirements of R.A. 9184, Section 53. Specifically, questioned whether the Additional Sidewalk, Streetlighting and Drainage System (Main Road) Project had a similar or related scope of work as the original contract (BEIP-Extension of Drainage Component System). If the procurement was invalid, the contracts might be unenforceable.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** TIEZA argued that Global-V should have first presented its money claim to the Commission on Audit (COA). The Supreme Court found Global-V's delay in payment, even less than two decades, constituted a violation of administrative procedures.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Governs government procurement. Section 59 mandates arbitration for covered contracts.
*   **R.A. 876 (Arbitration Law):** Provides general framework for arbitration in the Philippines.
*   **R.A. 9285 (Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004):** Referenced in GCC Clause 20.2.
*   **E.O. 1008:** Creates CIAC and defines its jurisdiction.
*   ***Guadines v. Sandiganbayan***: Reinforces the principle that existing laws are read into government contracts.
*   ***Hutama-Rsea Joint Operations, Inc. v. Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corp.***: Addresses the effect of an arbitration clause on CIAC's jurisdiction.
*   ***Vigilar v. Aquino***: Relates to exhaustion of administrative remedies before COA, specifically "unreasonable delay".
*   ***LICOMCEN, Inc. v. Foundation Specialists, Inc.***: Broad interpretation of CIAC's jurisdiction over construction contract disputes.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.***: Legal interest rate ruling, setting the rate at 6% from finality.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **GCC Clause 20.2 *vs.* R.A. 9184, Section 59:** The requirement in Clause 20.2 that the "process of arbitration shall be incorporated as a provision in [the] Contract" created uncertainty and was the basis of TIEZA's jurisdictional challenge. TIEZA interpreted this as a condition precedent, and that there was no agreement to arbitrate. The SC, however, found that non-compliance with this condition will not divest the CIAC of its jurisdiction over the construction controversy.
* Negotiated Procurement: Validity of the Additional Sidewalk, Streetlighting and Drainage System (Main Road) Project may be contentious since it has to meet a specific set of requirements. It may be argued whether or not there was a similar or related scope of work to the original contract to fall under Negotiated Procurement, Section 53 (d)[54] of R,A. No. 9184

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, affirming CIAC's jurisdiction and the monetary award to Global-V. TIEZA's arguments regarding the lack of a valid arbitration agreement, the primary jurisdiction of COA, and the invalidity of negotiated procurement were rejected.
