## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tabuelog*

**Citation:** 566 Phil. 297 (G.R. No. 178059, January 22, 2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, stemming from a stabbing incident.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).  The Information alleges treachery.
*   **Defense:** Self-defense. The accused admitted stabbing the victim, Clinton Badinas, resulting in his death.
*   **Stipulated Facts:** Accused admitted to the stabbing and the victim's death. Issue centered on treachery and self-defense.
*   **Lower Courts' Findings:** The trial court and Court of Appeals rejected self-defense and found the accused guilty of Murder, based on the presence of treachery.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Burden of Proof:** Prosecution must prove the elements of Murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Shifted Burden:** Accused, by invoking self-defense, bears the burden of proving its elements by clear and convincing evidence (unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity, lack of sufficient provocation). *People v. Concepcion* (G.R. No. 169060, February 6, 2007) cited.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Failure:** The Court agreed with the lower courts that the accused failed to convincingly demonstrate unlawful aggression by the victim. The implausibility of the defendant remaining unscathed while being attacked and inconsistent testimony of the defense witness were highlighted.
*   **Treachery Analysis:** The Supreme Court reverses the lower courts' finding of treachery. It emphasizes that *mere suddenness is insufficient* to establish treachery. The prosecution failed to prove the accused consciously adopted a specific mode of attack to deprive the victim of the opportunity to defend himself. *People v. Concepcion* (G.R. No. 169060, February 6, 2007) cited.
*   **Damages:** Award of actual damages (P113,776.00) overturned due to lack of supporting receipts. Temperate damages of P25,000.00 awarded instead, as the heirs suffered pecuniary loss, even though the precise amount was uncertain. *People v. Abesamis* (G.R. No. 140985, August 28, 2007) cited.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code (Rules for Application of Penalties)
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law
