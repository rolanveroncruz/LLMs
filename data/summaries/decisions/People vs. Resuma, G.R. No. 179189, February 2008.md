## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Resuma, G.R. No. 179189

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Reynaldo Resuma for two counts of rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Accused was charged with two counts of rape under separate Informations.
*   Prosecution presented testimony of victim (AAA), her sister (DDD), victim's aunt (EEE), victim's father (BBB), and medical evidence from Dr. Garrido confirming vaginal lacerations consistent with rape.
*   Defense presented denial and alibi, supported by the accused, the victim's mother (CCC), and accused's aunt, Maria Elisa Agravante Iligan (Iligan).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Appellant Resuma is obligated to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count of rape to the victim AAA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Despite the strong defense argument regarding reasonable doubt, the RTC and CA found the victim's testimony credible and consistent, which is often given significant weight.
*   The defense of alibi was found insufficient due to the proximity of the alibi locations to the crime scene and a lack of strong corroborating evidence.
*   CCC's testimony siding with the defendant is questionable and could be biased.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Rape):** The case revolves around the elements of rape, specifically carnal knowledge against the victim's will, achieved through force, violence, or intimidation.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 110, Section 8:**  Critical for the Court's decision to reduce the penalty. This rule requires that qualifying circumstances be explicitly alleged in the Information. Failure to do so prevents the court from considering them in sentencing.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87:** Cited regarding the automatic appeal process for cases involving the death penalty, which was later reduced.
*   **R.A. No. 7610 and R.A. No. 9262:** Used for withholding the identity of the victim.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Relationship between BBB and CCC:**  Discrepancies in testimony regarding their marital status could affect the assessment of CCC's bias.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** While the court provides justifications for the delay in reporting, the defense may continue to argue this point.
*   **Lack of Material Corroboration for Alibi:** The reliance on family member testimony (Iligan) without independent witnesses weakens the alibi defense.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for two counts of simple rape, reducing the penalty from death to reclusion perpetua because the Informations did not allege the qualifying circumstances of minority and the relationship between the accused and the victim. The court found the victim's testimony credible and consistent, and the defense of alibi insufficient.
