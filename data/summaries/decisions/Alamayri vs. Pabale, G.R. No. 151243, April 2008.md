## Legal Document Summary: *Alamayri v. Pabale*, G.R. No. 151243

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale executed by Nelly S. Nave (Nave) in favor of Rommel, Elmer, Erwin, Roiler, and Amanda Pabale (Pabale siblings), given a later declaration of Nave's incompetence.

**Key Provisions and Timeline:**

*   **1/3/1984:** Nave and Sesinando Fernando (Fernando) entered into a "Kasunduan Sa Pagbibilihan" (Contract to Sell). Nave allegedly reneged.
*   **2/6/1984:** Fernando filed a Complaint for Specific Performance against Nave (Civil Case No. 675-84-C) regarding the Calamba property.
*   **2/20/1984:** Nave executed a Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the Pabale siblings for the same Calamba property (TCT No. T-3317).
*   **1987:** Proceedings in Civil Case No. 675-84-C were suspended due to a Petition for Guardianship of Nave.
*   **6/22/1988:** RTC rendered judgment in SP No. 146-86-C finding Nave incompetent since 1980 (guardianship case). Atty. Paner appointed as her guardian. No appeal was made.
*   **12/9/1992:** Nave died.
*   **1993:** Atty. Gesmundo (Nave's sole heir) executed an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication pertaining to properties inherited from Nave.
*   **1997:** Lolita Alamayri (Alamayri) claimed she purchased the property from Atty. Gesmundo and sought substitution in Civil Case No. 675-84-C.
*   **12/2/1997:** RTC declared both sales agreements (Fernando and Pabale siblings) null and void, recognizing Alamayri as owner and ordering the Pabale siblings to reconvey the property.
*   **4/10/2001:** Court of Appeals reversed the RTC decision, upholding the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale to the Pabale siblings.
*   **4/30/2008:** Supreme Court DENIED Alamayri's Petition for Review, affirming the Court of Appeals decision.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Nave:** Originally obligated under the Kasunduan Sa Pagbibilihan with Fernando; subsequently obligated under the Deed of Absolute Sale with Pabale siblings.
*   **Fernando:** Obligated to pay attorney's fees in the RTC decision (later reversed).
*   **Pabale Siblings:** Initially ordered to reconvey the property and account for income in the RTC decision; ultimately had their ownership validated by the CA and SC.
*   **Alamayri:** Bears the cost of the appeal.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Nave's Competency:** Core legal question. The SC determined that the guardianship proceeding's finding of incompetency was not *res judicata* and did not retroactively invalidate the earlier sale to the Pabale siblings. The SC held that the party alleging incompetency bears the burden of proving it.
*   **Participation of Pabale Siblings in Guardianship Proceeding:** Alamayri's argument that Jose Pabale's (father of the Pabale siblings) presence at the guardianship hearing bound the Pabale siblings was rejected due to lack of proof of representation.
*   **Atty. Gesmundo's actions regarding the Deed of Absolute Sale and Deed of Donation to Alamayri:** This issue was not directly addressed, however the Supreme Court decision rendered the issue moot and academic.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 47, paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Rules of Court:** Addresses the effects of judgments and final orders, concerning *res judicata* principles ("bar by former judgment" and "conclusiveness of judgment").
*   **Rule 92, Section 1 and Rule 93 of the Rules of Court:** Sets out the rule of law about the concept of guardianship and its effects.
*   ***Oropeza Marketing Corporation v. Allied Banking Corporation***: Clarifies the distinction between "bar by prior judgment" and "conclusiveness of judgment."
*   ***Carillo v. Jaojoco***: Sets out the precedence on how one can be declared mentally incapacitated after the execution of a contract of sale, however it does not automatically prove that the same person was so when he/she executed the contract.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Retroactive application of the RTC's finding of Nave's incompetence:** The central dispute, ultimately resolved against Alamayri by the Supreme Court based on lack of *res judicata* and failure to prove incompetence at the time of the sale.

**Summary of Outcome:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of the Pabale siblings. The ruling emphasizes the burden of proof on the party alleging incompetence and the limited retroactive effect of a subsequent finding of incompetency in a guardianship proceeding. The case provides a valuable illustration of the application of *res judicata* principles, especially the doctrine of "conclusiveness of judgment."
