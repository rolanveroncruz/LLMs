## Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. CA and Liwanag, G.R. No. 128523

**Case Summary:** This case concerns a claim for death benefits under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 626, as amended (Employees' Compensation Law), filed by Zenaida Liwanag, the surviving spouse of Jaime Liwanag, a deceased police officer who died from complications arising from Hepatitis B. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) denied the claim, arguing that the illness was not an occupational disease and that the risk of contracting the disease was not increased by the deceased's employment. The Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC) affirmed the GSIS decision. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, granting the claim. The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the ECC decision.

**Key Provisions & Legal Framework:**

*   **P.D. No. 626 (Employees' Compensation Law):** Governs the eligibility for compensation benefits related to work-related illnesses, injuries, or death. Supersedes the Workmen's Compensation Act, removing the presumption of compensability.
*   **Section 1(B), Rule III of Amended Rules on Employees’ Compensation:** Sets forth the requirements for compensability of an illness.
*   **Annex "A" of the Rules on Employees' Compensation:** Lists occupational diseases.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Claimant (Zenaida Liwanag) bears the burden to prove either:
    *   (1) The sickness is a listed occupational disease in Annex "A" *or*
    *   (2) The risk of contracting the disease was increased by the working conditions.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **GSIS:** Responsible for administering the State Insurance Fund and paying out compensation benefits to eligible claimants under P.D. No. 626.
*   **Employee/Dependents:** Obligated to provide substantial evidence demonstrating the causal link between the employment and the illness.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The core issue is whether Zenaida Liwanag provided sufficient "substantial evidence" to establish the causal link. The SC found the PNP reports submitted were insufficient as evidence.
*   **PNP Reports:** The CA relied on the PNP investigation, concluding the death was in the line of duty. The SC rejected this, arguing the purpose was to determine line of duty status, a different standard than compensability under P.D. No. 626.
*   **Hearsay:** The statement in the PNP report claiming that the deceased acquired Hepatitis B due to some of his co-workers in his office who tested positive for Hepatitis B was deemed to be inadmissible hearsay.
*   **Due Process:** The SC noted that the Police Chief Inspector should have recused himself from the proceeding because his prior involvement in the investigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Ang Tibay v. The Court of Industrial Relations, 69 Phil. 635 (1940):** Defines the standard of "substantial evidence" in administrative proceedings, requiring more than a mere scintilla and excluding uncorroborated hearsay.
*   **Latagan v. Employees’ Compensation Commission, 213 SCRA 715 (1992):** Discusses the abandonment of the presumption of compensability under P.D. No. 626.
*   **Rivera v. Civil Service Commission, 240 SCRA 43 (1995):** Addresses the issue of due process in administrative proceedings, emphasizing the requirement of an impartial tribunal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Increased Risk" Interpretation:** The exact degree of increased risk that must be demonstrated to satisfy the "increased risk" prong is open to interpretation, particularly when considering the general susceptibility of the population to Hepatitis B.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This is a denial of death benefits case under PD 626. The SC reversed the CA, finding the surviving spouse failed to meet the burden of proving a causal link between the deceased's Hepatitis B infection and his employment as a police officer. Key weaknesses were reliance on the PNP investigation that used different standards for line of duty status, hearsay evidence in PNP reports, and failure to meet the substantial evidence threshold. The SC emphasized that the social justice policy and liberal interpretation of laws does not justify compensation without evidence that the work environment significantly increased the risk of contracting the illness, citing *Ang Tibay* regarding administrative due process. The ruling underscores the importance of medical evidence and a direct causal connection to employment conditions, not mere possibility. Consider: implications for future PD 626 claims involving non-listed diseases and the evidentiary standards required to meet that standard.
