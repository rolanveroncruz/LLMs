**Case Summary: *Delfina Hernandez Santiago v. Atty. Zosimo Santiago and Atty. Nicomedes Tolentino*, A.C. No. 3921, June 11, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative case for disbarment filed against two lawyers, Atty. Zosimo Santiago and Atty. Nicomedes Tolentino, for deceit, gross misconduct, and violation of their oath as members of the Bar.

**Factual Background:** Complainant, Delfina Santiago, alleged that respondents, while serving as City Legal Officers, issued a Resolution recommending her dismissal based on false statements and without due process. The core of the complaint revolves around a Resolution signed by the respondents which recommended Santiago's dismissal following her failure to return to work after a cancelled leave of absence. Santiago claimed the resolution contained deceitful statements, particularly relating to a prior administrative charge and alleged failure to provide due process.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Deceitful Statements in Resolution:** Complainant argues that the Resolution contained false statements regarding a prior administrative case against her and her alleged failure to receive proper notice or due process prior to the recommendation of her dismissal. The specific claim is that she was not previously charged with unauthorized absences, making assertions in the Resolution inaccurate.
*   **Gross Misconduct:** Complainant alleges that the issuance of the Resolution without proper factual basis and due process constitutes gross misconduct.
*   **Violation of Attorney's Oath:** Complainant alleges that the respondents violated their attorney's oath by issuing the Resolution with false statements and without due process.

**Respondents' Defense:**

*   Argued that the statements, if inaccurate, were the result of misappreciation of facts, not malicious intent. The Mayor's referral of the case was treated as a complaint, and efforts were made to notify the complainant. The investigation was conducted ex parte after complainant failed to respond.
*   Referral from the Mayor was deemed an equivalent to an administrative complaint.

**IBP Findings:**

*   The IBP Investigating Commissioner recommended dismissal of the complaint, finding no convincing evidence of bad faith on the part of respondents. The IBP Board of Governors approved this recommendation.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Court affirmed the IBP's recommendation and dismissed the complaint. The Court held that the Complainant failed to establish by substantial evidence that the respondents intentionally and deliberately made false statements in the resolution to deceive and induce Mayor Asistio to dismiss the complainant from service.

**Key Legal Issues:**

*   **Burden of Proof in Disbarment Cases:** The Court emphasized the high burden of proof required to justify disbarment or suspension, requiring clear and convincing evidence of intentional misconduct.
*   **Good Faith Performance of Official Duties:** The Court noted that absent evidence of bad faith or malice, lawyers acting in their official capacity should not be administratively penalized for errors in judgment.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Cojuangco, Jr. v. Palma*, 501 Phil. 1, 10 (2005): Confirms that resolutions of the IBP Board of Governors are recommendatory only.
*   *Lahm III v. Mayor, Jr.*, 682 Phil. 1, 8 (2012): Defines gross misconduct.
*   *Ali v. Bubong*, 493 Phil. 172, 182 (2005): Addresses the applicability of the Code of Professional Responsibility to lawyers in government service.
*   *Osop v. Fontanilla*, 417 Phil. 724, 730 (2001): Requisites for disciplinary action.
*   *Cabas v. Sususco*, A.C. No. 8677, June 15, 2016, 793 SCRA 309, 315: "mere allegation is not evidence".

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court: Grounds for disbarment or suspension.
*   Rule 139-B, Section 1 of the Rules of Court (prior to amendment): Procedure for disbarment proceedings.
*   Presidential Decree No. 807, Section 38: Procedure in Administrative Cases Against Non-Presidential Appointees.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Due Process:** While the Court found no intentional deceit, the process undertaken by the respondents in recommending the dismissal could be scrutinized for potential procedural deficiencies under Civil Service laws.
*   **Weight of Mayor's Referral:** The determination that the Mayor's referral of the matter was equivalent to an administrative complaint may be challenged as insufficient notice and formal charge, potentially violating due process.
*   The dismissal of the administrative case does not preclude separate administrative cases impugning the dismissal from service.

**Conclusion:**

The Court dismissed the disbarment complaint due to lack of substantial evidence of intentional deceit, gross misconduct, or violation of the attorney's oath by the respondents. However, the decision does not validate the propriety of the dismissal procedure used by the City Legal Officers, opening the possibility of pursuing other remedies against the dismissal from service.
