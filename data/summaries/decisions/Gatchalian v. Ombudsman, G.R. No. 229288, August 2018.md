## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 229288 (Gatchalian v. Office of the Ombudsman)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Subject Matter:** Jurisdiction over decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in criminal cases.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) has jurisdiction to review decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases, specifically a finding of probable cause to indict Sherwin Gatchalian.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the CA **does not** have jurisdiction. The Petition for Review on Certiorari was denied, and the CA's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was affirmed.

**Facts:**

*   Sherwin Gatchalian was indicted by the Ombudsman for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, Malversation under Article 217 of the RPC, and violation of Section X126.2(C) (1) and (2) of MORB in relation to Sections 36 and 37 of R.A. 7653, arising from the sale of shares in Express Savings Bank, Inc. (ESBI) to Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA). The Ombudsman found probable cause against Gatchalian and others.
*   Gatchalian filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 with the CA, arguing grave abuse of discretion by the Ombudsman.
*   The CA dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, relying on established jurisprudence.
*   Gatchalian appealed to the SC, arguing that *Morales v. Court of Appeals* (772 Phil. 672 (2015)) changed the jurisdictional landscape.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Jurisdiction over Ombudsman decisions in criminal cases:** The SC reiterated the established doctrine that decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases are reviewable **only** by the Supreme Court via a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, alleging grave abuse of discretion. This stems from cases like *Kuizon v. Desierto* (406 Phil. 611 (2001)) and *Estrada v. Desierto* (487 Phil. 169 (2004)).

*   **Inapplicability of *Morales v. Court of Appeals*:** The SC clarified that *Morales v. CA* applies only to *administrative* cases, specifically interlocutory orders (preventive suspension orders) that are unappealable. *Morales* did not overturn the established jurisprudence regarding criminal cases. The ruling in *Morales* which declared Section 14 of RA 6770 unconstitutional did not affect appellate procedure of criminal cases given that the remedy was a rule prescribed by the Court.

*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The SC distinguished the cases and ruled that the decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman can only be assailed through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 filed with the Supreme Court due to the finding of the existence of probable cause.

*   **Stare Decisis:** The Court reaffirmed the principle of *stare decisis et non quieta movere*, emphasizing the importance of following established precedents.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (R.A. 3019):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Section 3(e)
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 217 (Malversation)
*   **Republic Act No. 7653 (R.A. 7653):** The New Central Bank Act, Sections 36 and 37.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770 (R.A. 6770):** The Ombudsman Act of 1989, specifically Section 14 (declared partially unconstitutional in *Morales*), and Section 27 (declared unconstitutional in *Fabian v. Desierto*)
*   **Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB):** Section X126.2(C) (1) and (2).

**Case Law References:**

*   **Fabian vs. Desierto (356 Phil. 787 (1998)):**  Dealt with administrative cases and the unconstitutionality of Section 27 of RA 6770.
*   **Kuizon v. Desierto (406 Phil. 611 (2001)):** Established SC jurisdiction over criminal cases originating from the Ombudsman.
*   **Estrada v. Desierto (487 Phil. 169 (2004)):** Further clarified SC jurisdiction via Rule 65 for Ombudsman decisions in criminal cases.
*   **Morales v. Court of Appeals (772 Phil. 672 (2015)):** Addressed interlocutory orders, specifically a preventive suspension order in an administrative case, and was distinguished in the present case.

**Potential Risks & Considerations:**

*   **Gatchalian's potential criminal liability:** The case does not decide the merits of the criminal charges against Gatchalian, but rather clarifies the proper forum for challenging the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause.
*   **Limited scope of Certiorari:** The SC emphasizes that only *grave abuse of discretion* by the Ombudsman will warrant judicial intervention. Mere errors in fact or law are insufficient.
*   **Rule 65 Strictures:** As such, he must show grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the decision clarifies the application of *Morales v. CA*, arguments could still arise regarding whether a particular Ombudsman action constitutes an administrative or criminal matter, potentially affecting the appropriate avenue for review.
