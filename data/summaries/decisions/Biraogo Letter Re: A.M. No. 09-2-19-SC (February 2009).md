## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 09-2-19-SC

**Document:** Report of the Investigating Committee regarding the unauthorized release of an unpromulgated ponencia of Justice Ruben T. Reyes in *Limkaichong v. COMELEC, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 178831-32, etc.).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Investigation Mandate:** The Supreme Court (SC) *En Banc* created an Investigating Committee to determine who was responsible for the leakage of the confidential, unpromulgated ponencia to Louis C. Biraogo and to recommend appropriate actions.
*   **Findings of Fact:**  The committee established a detailed timeline of the ponencia's circulation, including its signing, reprinting of signature page 36, and retrieval from the Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ). Significant findings include discrepancies between the leaked copy and the official copy regarding the agenda date and item number, Justice signatures, Asterisks footnotes of Justices on leave after Justice names.
*   **Liability:**
    *   **Justice Ruben T. Reyes (Ret.):** Found liable for **Grave Misconduct** for leaking the confidential internal document. The committee inferred Justice Reyes's intent based on circumstantial evidence, focusing on his undue interest in the case and inconsistencies in his testimony. *Res ipsa loquitur* principle is invoked despite Justice Reyes's denial. Cites *Macalintal v. Teh* regarding gross inefficiency or bad faith in deviating from norms, undermining faith in the judiciary. Also, *Dizon*, regarding facts themselves being indicative of evil intent.
    *   Justice Reyes also liable for **GROSS MISCONDUCT** for violating his oath as a lawyer and the Code of Professional Responsibility (*Canon 1, Rules 1.01, 1.02*). The act of Justice Reyes not only violated the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Canons of Judicial Ethics, it also infringed on the internal deliberations of the Court and impeded and degraded the administration of justice.
    *   **Atty. Rosendo B. Evangelista (Judicial Staff Head):** Found liable for **Simple Neglect of Duty** due to lack of supervision and failure to ensure safekeeping of confidential documents.
    *   **Armando Del Rosario (Court Stenographer):** Found liable for **Simple Neglect of Duty** for failing to exercise the required degree of care in the custody of the Gilbert copy.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Justice Reyes:** Fined P500,000.00 (charged against retirement benefits), disqualified from holding government office, and directed to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be disciplined as a member of the Bar.
    *   **Atty. Evangelista:** Fined P10,000.00.
    *   **Armando Del Rosario:** Fined P5,000.00.

**Obligations:**

*   **Confidentiality:** Emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality of internal court deliberations and documents, citing the New Code of Judicial Conduct, Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, and relevant case law (*Chavez v. PCGG*, *Chavez v. Public Estates Authority*, *Mirasol v. De La Torre, Jr.*, *Betguen v. Masangcay*).
*   **Lawyer's Oath/CPR:** Justice Reyes's actions were determined to violate his lawyer's oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Justice Reyes:** Liable for grave misconduct in his role as a judge and gross misconduct in his capacity as a lawyer.
*   **Atty. Evangelista & Del Rosario:** Liable for simple neglect of duty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The finding of liability against Justice Reyes relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, which is always a potential point of contention and could be challenged.
*   **Application of _Res Ipsa Loquitur_:** While the Court relies on the principle of *res ipsa loquitur* to infer intent, the decision acknowledges more recent jurisprudence that requires proof of malice or bad faith even when applying this doctrine.
*   **Impact of Retirement:** While the document explicitly states that Justice Reyes's retirement does not preclude the findings or penalties imposed, this could be a point of appeal or legal challenge, particularly regarding the extent to which retirement benefits can be affected.  Cites *Pagano v. Nazarro, Jr.* and *Largo v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **"New Copy" issue** The committee brought out a copy of the document that Justice Reyes supplied and tried to hide, and that showed discrepancies between the original copies of the document. He offered no explanation and caused distrust of his side of the story.
*   **Violation Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility** Violates ethical standards by receiving money as legal service and subsequently failing to render such service, citing *Emiliano Court Townhouses Homeowners Association v. Dioneda*.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138:** Mentions this law that states what can lead to disbarment or suspension of attorneys by the Supreme Court.

**Conclusion:**

This document is a detailed investigation report finding a Justice of the Supreme Court liable for leaking a confidential document.

However, the reliance on circumstantial evidence and the invocation of *res ipsa loquitur* could be grounds for legal challenges.
