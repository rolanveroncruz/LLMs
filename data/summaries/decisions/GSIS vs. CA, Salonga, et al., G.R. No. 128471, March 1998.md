## Legal Document Summary: *GSIS vs. CA, Salonga, et al.* G.R. No. 128471

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court decision in an action for declaration of ownership and cancellation of title.

**Key Facts:**

*   Private respondents (Salonga, Tan, Usman) held TCTs for two parcels of land.
*   New TCTs covering the same land were fraudulently issued to Queen’s Row Subdivision, Inc. (QRSI).
*   QRSI obtained a loan from GSIS, secured by a real estate mortgage including the disputed properties.
*   QRSI defaulted, GSIS foreclosed, and became the highest bidder.
*   Respondents sued QRSI, Register of Deeds, and GSIS for declaration of ownership and cancellation of titles.
*   Trial Court ruled for respondents, ordering revival of their TCTs, cancellation of QRSI’s TCTs, and awarding attorney's fees.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **GSIS Loan Agreement:** GSIS granted QRSI a loan secured by a mortgage on real estate, including the disputed properties. *Obligation*: GSIS to exercise due diligence in ensuring the validity of the mortgage.
*   **Torrens System:** The case hinges on priority and validity of TCTs and whether GSIS can claim protection as a mortgagee/purchaser in good faith under the Torrens System.
*   **Declaration of Ownership and Cancellation of Titles:** Trial Court ordered cancellation of QRSI's TCTs and revival of respondents' TCTs, establishing respondents' ownership. *Liability*: QRSI liable for fraudulently obtaining the titles. GSIS potentially liable for improperly relying on QRSI's titles.
* **Attorney's fees**: Trial court ordered GSIS and QRSI to pay attorney's fees.

**Legal Issues:**

*   **Good Faith Purchaser/Mortgagee:**  Did GSIS act as a mortgagee and subsequent purchaser in good faith? The Court held GSIS did *not* act in good faith due to a lack of due diligence in verifying the titles, especially considering the large loan amount and its fiduciary duty to its members.
*   **Prescription/Laches:** Has the respondents' cause of action prescribed due to delay in asserting their rights? The Court held laches did *not* apply as respondents promptly filed complaints upon discovering the fraudulent titles.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Government Service Insurance Act of 1977 (PD 1146):**  Cited concerning GSIS's mandate and obligations.
*   **Government Service Insurance System Act of 1997 (RA 8291):** Section 36 on investment of funds, emphasizing liquidity, safety, security, and yield; Section 41(C) on power to invest funds.
*   **Act 496 (Land Registration Act):** Implied reference to good faith purchaser/mortgagee provisions.

**Case Law:**

*   **Tomas v. Tomas, 98 SCRA 280 (1980):** Applied, holding banks (and by extension, GSIS) to a higher standard of due diligence in dealing with registered lands due to their public interest function.
*   **Rural Bank of Compostela v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 122801, April 8, 1997:** Applied, holding a bank not a mortgagee in good faith if it fails to observe due diligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The degree of due diligence expected of GSIS is a contentious point. The court emphasized the fiduciary duty and the amount of the loan to justify a higher standard.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   GSIS loses ownership of the properties.
*   GSIS may be exposed to liability for failing to exercise due diligence in protecting its investments.
*   GSIS may face reputational damage due to its handling of the loan and subsequent foreclosure.

**Summary of Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision, affirming the RTC's ruling in favor of the private respondents. GSIS was found not to be a mortgagee or purchaser in good faith due to a lack of due diligence in verifying the validity of QRSI's titles. The respondents' cause of action was not barred by laches. The award of attorney's fees was also upheld. This decision highlights the higher duty of care expected from institutions like GSIS when dealing with registered lands.
