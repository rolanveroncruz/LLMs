**Legal Document Summary: *Sueno v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 174711 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) grant of a Writ of Possession in favor of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).

**Facts:**

*   Sally Sueno (Petitioner) obtained loans from LBP (Respondent), secured by real estate mortgages over two parcels of land.
*   Petitioner defaulted, leading LBP to extrajudicially foreclose on the mortgages.
*   LBP was the highest bidder at the auction sale.
*   Petitioner requested a 6-month extension to redeem the properties.
*   LBP required an initial payment of P115,000.00.
*   Petitioner made a partial payment of P50,000.00.
*   LBP denied the extension, consolidated ownership, and obtained new TCTs in its name.
*   LBP filed an Ex Parte Petition for Writ of Possession, opposed by Petitioner.
*   RTC granted the writ; CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Establishes the initial debt and Petitioner's obligation to repay.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Creates a security interest in the land in favor of LBP.
*   **Foreclosure Sale:** LBP's right to sell the property upon default (Act 3135).
*   **Right of Redemption:** Petitioner's statutory right to reclaim the property within one year from the registration of the certificate of sale.
*   **Writ of Possession:** LBP's right, as the purchaser, to obtain possession of the property upon consolidation of ownership (Section 33, Rule 39, Rules of Court; Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118).

**Issues:**

1.  Whether a valid novation occurred, extending the redemption period.
2.  Whether the issuance of the Writ of Possession to LBP was valid.

**Ruling:**

1.  **No Novation:** The Supreme Court (SC) found no novation because there was no clear agreement to a new contract. LBP's requirement of the P115,000.00 payment was a suspensive condition for granting the extension. Partial payment did not constitute acceptance of the extension request. Cites Article 1292 of the Civil Code. Rejects any presumption of novation. *Philippine Savings Bank v. Mañalac, Jr.* (G.R. No. 145441, 2005)
2.  **Valid Writ of Possession:** The SC held that LBP was entitled to the writ because the redemption period had lapsed, LBP consolidated ownership, and obtained new TCTs. Cites Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and Section 7 of Act 3135. The issuance of the writ is a ministerial duty of the court upon proper application and proof of title. *Philippine National Bank v. Sanao Marketing Corporation* (G.R. No. 153951, 2005).

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for the costs of the suit.
*   Petitioner is liable for the unpaid balance under the original loan agreement that led to the foreclosure.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Absence of Written Agreement:** The entire argument for novation hinges on a potential implied agreement, making it difficult to prove.
*   **Conditions Precedent:** LBP's requirement of full payment as a condition precedent for granting the extension was not fully met, negating the formation of a new contract.
*   **Estoppel:** Although not explicitly raised, there's a minor risk that Petitioner might attempt to argue that LBP's acceptance of the partial payment created an estoppel barring them from denying the extension.  However, this is unlikely to succeed given the prompt communication from LBP clarifying the condition.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 1292:** Defines novation.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sec. 33:** Governs the issuance of a deed and possession upon the expiration of the redemption period.
*   **Act 3135, Sec. 7 (as amended by Act 4118):** Details the procedure for obtaining possession during the redemption period and after consolidation.
*   ***Philippine Savings Bank v. Mañalac, Jr.*, G.R. No. 145441 (2005):** Defines the requirements and presumptions against novation.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Sanao Marketing Corporation*, G.R. No. 153951 (2005):**  Clarifies the rights of the purchaser and the ministerial duty to issue a writ of possession.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The communication between LBP and Sueno regarding the possible extension of the redemption period and the P115,000.00 payment became the focal point of the litigation, as Sueno argued that it constituted implied consent to extend the redemption period.

In summary, the SC affirmed the CA's decision, upholding LBP's right to possess the foreclosed properties due to the lapse of the redemption period and the lack of a valid novation extending the redemption period. The case reinforces the strict requirements for establishing novation and clarifies the ministerial duty of courts to issue writs of possession in favor of purchasers who have consolidated ownership after a valid foreclosure.
