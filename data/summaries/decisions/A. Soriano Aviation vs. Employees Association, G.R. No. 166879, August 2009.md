## Legal Document Summary: A. Soriano Aviation v. Employees Association of A. Soriano Aviation, G.R. No. 166879

**Nature:** Labor dispute involving illegal strikes and loss of employment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA):** Effective January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1999, including a "No-Strike, No-Lockout" clause.
*   **"No-Strike, No-Lockout" Clause:** A central point of contention, with the employer claiming violations.
*   **Article 264 of the Labor Code:** Relevant to prohibited activities during strikes and potential loss of employment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Union:** Obligation to comply with procedural requirements for a valid strike under the Labor Code, and to refrain from violence, intimidation, or coercion during strikes.
*   **Employer:** Subject to unfair labor practice claims if actions like dismissals violate employee rights to self-organization.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   **Union Officers:** Potential termination for knowingly participating in an illegal strike (Art. 264(a), Labor Code).
*   **Workers (Union Members):** Potential termination for knowingly participating in the commission of illegal acts during an illegal strike (Art. 264(a), Labor Code). *Mere participation* is not sufficient; illegal acts must be proven.

**Factual Background:**

*   **First Strike:** Mechanics refused overtime work on holidays. Employer considered this a concerted action violating the "No-Strike, No-Lockout" clause. Initially filed a complaint for illegal strike (NLRC Case No. 07-05409-97), then re-opened it. Labor Arbiter deemed the strike illegal due to a non-strikeable issue (validity of new work schedule) and procedural non-compliance.
*   **Second Strike:** Union filed a Notice of Strike with the NCMB, alleging union busting, illegal dismissal, illegal suspension, etc. Strike commenced after conciliation failed.
*   **Alleged Illegal Acts During Second Strike:** Shouting foul language, threats, damage to property, insulting placards (detailed in the decision).

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The **first strike was illegal** due to being grounded on a non-strikeable issue (work schedule) and non-compliance with procedural requirements.
*   While the **second strike** arose from perceived unfair labor practices (potentially shielding it from the "No-Strike, No-Lockout" clause), it was rendered **illegal** due to the commission of illegal acts during the strike by union members.
*   Cites *Sukhothai Cuisine v. Court of Appeals* and Art. 264(e) of the Labor Code regarding prohibited picketing activities.
*   The appellate court erred in finding the acts of violence to not be serious enough to warrant loss of employment.
*   The Supreme Court **remanded the case to the NLRC** for the purpose of determining the Union status of individual respondents and their respective liabilities, if any (i.e., determining *who* participated in the *illegal acts*, and whether union officers knowingly participated in the *illegal strike* itself).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article XIII, Section 3 of the Constitution:** Guarantees worker's right to strike "in accordance with law".
*   **Article 264 of the Labor Code:** Prohibited Activities and Unfair Labor Practices; outlines permissible grounds for dismissal.
*   **Article 264(e):** Relates to prohibited picketing activities.
*   **Article 264(a):** Pertains to penalties for participating in illegal strikes.

**Case Law:**

*   **Panay Electric Co. v. NLRC:** "No Strike-No Lockout" provision may only be invoked by the employer when the strike is economic in nature or one which is conducted to force wage or other concessions from the employer that are not mandated to be granted by law.
*   **Malayang Samahan ng mga Manggaggawa sa M. Greenfield v. Ramos:** Good faith belief in unfair labor practice can excuse procedural lapses in striking.
*   **Philippine Diamond Hotel:** Exercise of right to strike is not absolute; illegal means render strike illegal.
*   **Sukhothai Cuisine v. Court of Appeals:** Details limits on picketing activities; strike may be illegal even if objective is lawful if means are illegal.
*   **Samahang Manggagawa sa Sulpicio Lines, Inc.-NAFLU v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc.:** Effects of illegal strikes differentiate between workers and officers; proof requirements.
*   **Shell Oil Workers' Union v. Shell Company of the Philippines** and **First City Interlink Transportation Co., Inc., v. Roldan-Confesor** and **Maria Cristina Fertilizer Plant Employees Association v. Tandaya:** Cited by the Labor Arbiter to establish the gravity of acts required to justify loss of employment (overturned on appeal).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Establishing Individual Liability:** Determining which specific respondents committed which illegal acts and the level of their involvement during the second strike may present evidentiary challenges.
*   **Determining "Knowing Participation":** For union officers, establishing "knowing participation" in the *illegal strike* requires proving they were aware of the strike's illegality *and* still participated.
*   **Discretion of NLRC on Remand:** The NLRC has discretion in assessing the evidence and determining the appropriate penalties for each individual respondent.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   On remand to the NLRC, focus on presenting clear and convincing evidence linking individual respondents to the specific acts of violence, intimidation, and property damage detailed in the original complaint.
*   Distinguish this case from *Shell Oil Workers' Union v. Shell Company of the Philippines, First City Interlink Transportation Co., Inc., v. Roldan-Confesor* and *Maria Cristina Fertilizer Plant Employees Association v. Tandaya* by emphasizing the sustained nature of the illegal activity and the detrimental impact of the violent strike on the employer's operations and reputation.
*   Consider arguments related to the economic damage caused by the false accusations made during the strike, to justify the severity of the consequences.
