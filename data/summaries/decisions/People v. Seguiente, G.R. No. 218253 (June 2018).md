**Case Summary: People v. Seguiente, G.R. No. 218253 (June 20, 2018)**

**Overview:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Evelyn Seguiente y Ramirez of violating Sections 5 (Illegal Sale of Shabu) and 11 (Illegal Possession of Shabu) of RA 9165. The acquittal was based on the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, raising reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violations Charged:** Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Prosecution alleged a valid buy-bust operation.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The central issue was the prosecution's failure to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR regarding the post-seizure handling of the drugs.
*   **Inventory and Photography:** Failure to conduct a physical inventory and take photographs of the seized drugs in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, the Department of Justice, and an elected public official. The inventory record was incomplete, lacking required signatures.
*   **Marking:** While marking at the police station is permissible, it was not done in the presence of the accused, as required by *People v. Salonga, 717 Phil. 117, 127 (2013)*.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a) of the IRR as amended by RA 10640):** The prosecution failed to invoke the saving clause by providing justifiable grounds for non-compliance with the procedural requirements and establishing that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Police Obligations:** Strict adherence to the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Interpretation:** The "justifiable grounds" provision in the saving clause is prone to varied interpretation and is a frequent point of contention in drug cases.
*   **Lack of Justification:** The prosecution's failure to offer *any* justification for the procedural lapses was fatal to their case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5 & 11:** Defines offenses related to illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21 & IRR:** Prescribes the procedure for handling seized drugs, including inventory, photography, and chain of custody requirements.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Section 21 of RA 9165, adding the "saving clause."
*   **People v. Salonga, 717 Phil. 117, 127 (2013):** Requires marking of seized items to be done in the presence of the accused or their representative.
*   **People v. Relato, 679 Phil. 268, 278 (2012):**  States that the State fails to establish *corpus delicti* when substantial gaps exist in the chain of custody.

**Conclusion:**  The court found that the prosecution's failure to adhere to the mandatory procedures of RA 9165 created reasonable doubt regarding the identity and integrity of the seized drugs, warranting the accused's acquittal.  The case underscores the importance of strict compliance with chain of custody rules in drug cases.
