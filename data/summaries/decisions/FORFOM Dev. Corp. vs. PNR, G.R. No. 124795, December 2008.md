## Legal Document Summary: Forfom Development Corporation vs. Philippine National Railways (G.R. No. 124795, December 10, 2008)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Forfom Development Corporation (Forfom) - Landowner
*   **Respondent:** Philippine National Railways (PNR) - Government corporation

**Key Issue:** Whether Forfom can recover possession of its land occupied by PNR for a commuter line project (Carmona Project) despite PNR's failure to file an expropriation case or pay just compensation.

**Facts:**

*   PNR, pursuant to a Presidential mandate and P.D. 741 (PNR Charter), occupied a 100,128 sq.m. portion of Forfom's land in 1972/1973 to construct the San Pedro-Carmona Commuter Line.
*   Forfom filed a complaint for recovery of possession and damages in 1990, alleging forcible taking and failure to pay just compensation.
*   PNR claimed acquisition was authorized, negotiations occurred with landowners (including Forfom's predecessor-in-interest), and adjoining landowners were paid P1.25/sq.m.
*   Trial court ruled for Forfom, awarding just compensation (P10/sq.m.), unearned income, and damages, but denying recovery of possession due to Forfom's acquiescence.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed denial of recovery of possession and the P10/sq.m. valuation but deleted the award of damages.
*   PNR did not appeal; Forfom filed the current petition.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** PNR has the power of eminent domain under its charter (Republic Act No. 4156, as amended by Republic Act No. 6366 and Presidential Decree No. 741).
*   **Taking:** A taking occurred because PNR entered Forfom's property permanently, under color of authority, for a public purpose, and deprived Forfom of beneficial enjoyment. The Court cited *Heirs of Mateo Pidacan and Romana Eigo v. Air Transportation Office, G.R. No. 162779, 15 June 2007*.
*   **Estoppel/Waiver:** Forfom is estopped from recovering possession due to its inaction for 18 years and engaging in negotiations with PNR for just compensation.  Court cited *Manila Railroad Co. v. Paredes, 32 Phil. 534 (1915)*; *De Ynchausti v. Manila Electric Railroad & Light Co., 36 Phil. 908 (1917)*; *Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr., G.R. No. 50147, 3 August 1990*.
*   **Public Use:** The Court determined that the public-use requirement for eminent domain is broad and includes indirect public benefit and social welfare projects, citing *Reyes v. National Housing Authority, 443 Phil. 603 (2003)*. It accepted PNR's leasing to qualified tenants as serving a legitimate housing purpose, benefiting the public, relying on the principle that what is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use.
*   **Just Compensation:** Non-payment of just compensation does not entitle the landowner to recover possession, citing *Reyes v. National Housing Authority, supra*. The court ruled that *MIAA v. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 161836, 28 February 2006* dictates the value be reckoned from the time of taking (January 1973), but failed to follow the procedure under the Rules of Civil Procedure to fix just compensation.
*   **Procedure for Determining Just Compensation:** The SC emphasized the mandatory procedure for determining just compensation in expropriation cases, which requires the appointment of commissioners. Citing *National Power Corp. v. dela Cruz, G.R. No. 156093, 2 February 2007, 514 SCRA 56*, the court stresses that trial with the aid of the commissioners is a substantial right that may not be done away with capriciously or for no reason at all.
*   **Interest:** Forfom is entitled to legal interest (6% per annum) from the time of taking (1973) until full payment.  *National Power Corporation v. Angas, G.R. Nos. 60225-26, 8 May 1992*.
*   **Other Damages:** While failing to meet the evidentiary standard for actual damages, the court awarded attorney's fees (P100,000) and litigation expenses (P50,000) due to PNR's prolonged delay in filing an expropriation case and paying just compensation. The court stated that the question of crop damages is better left to be determined in the expropriation case to be filed.

**Order:**

*   Petition is partially denied regarding recovery of possession, unearned income, and rentals.
*   Petition is partially granted: PNR to pay attorney's fees and litigation expenses.
*   PNR to *forthwith* institute expropriation action to determine just compensation based on 1973 value, with 6% interest from taking until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Date:** Determination of land value as of 1973 is likely to result in a significantly lower compensation than current market value, potentially disadvantaging Forfom.
*   **Expropriation Proceedings:** The directive to "forthwith" institute expropriation proceedings needs to be enforced to prevent further delays. PNR's compliance should be closely monitored, and a motion for execution on this part of the judgment might be considered.
*   **"Public Use" Determination:** Although this was deemed to be satisfactory by the court, counsel for Forfom should scrutinise the facts of the proposed land use by the private respondents, in order to secure the most favourable outcome for his client.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 4156 (PNR Charter)
*   Republic Act No. 6366 (Amendment to PNR Charter)
*   Presidential Decree No. 741 (PNR Charter)
*   Section 9, Article III, Constitution
*   1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Section 5

**Recommendations:**

*   Aggressively pursue the expropriation case.
*   Gather evidence to support a higher valuation as of 1973.
*   Monitor PNR's compliance with the order to file the expropriation case.
*   Consider motion for execution to compel PNR to institute expropriation proceedings.
