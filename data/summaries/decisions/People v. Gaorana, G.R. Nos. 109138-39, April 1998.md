**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gaorana*, G.R. Nos. 109138-39 (1998)**

**Case Overview:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Alberto Gaorana of two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC sentenced him to two terms of *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay P50,000 in indemnity to the victim.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction based on the credible testimony of the victim, Marivel Fuentes, despite minor inconsistencies.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court reiterated that minor inconsistencies in witness testimony strengthen credibility, aligning with *People v. Travero, et al.* The Court emphasized the trial court's opportunity to assess witness demeanor.
*   **Elements of Rape:** The Court cited Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, focusing on the element of force and intimidation, which was established by the prosecution's evidence.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi was rejected due to the proximity of the accused's residence to the crime scene and his access to the victim's house.
*   **Motive:** The Court deemed motive unnecessary for conviction since the accused was positively identified, citing *People v. Zaballero.*
*   **Quasi-Recidivism:** The alleged aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism was not proven due to the lack of a certified copy of the prior conviction, adhering to *People v. Cadevida* and Article 160 RPC.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** The Court modified the civil indemnity, ordering the accused to pay P50,000 for each count of rape, totaling P100,000, following *People v. Caballes*.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve two *reclusion perpetua* sentences.
*   Accused is obligated to pay the victim a total of P100,000 as civil indemnity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the rape offenses.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Minor Inconsistencies:** While the Court deemed inconsistencies minor, a future legal challenge could attempt to reframe them as material discrepancies affecting credibility.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence of Force:** The conviction hinges heavily on the victim's testimony regarding force and intimidation. Any challenge to her credibility could undermine this evidence.
* Quasi-Recidivism could be successfully argued if the prosection has the correct documents
