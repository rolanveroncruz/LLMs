Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Solid Homes, Inc. v. Evelina Laserna and Gloria Cajipe* (G.R. No. 166051, April 08, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Office of the President's (OP) decision which upheld the HLURB Board of Commissioners’ ruling regarding a Contract to Sell.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract to Sell (April 1, 1977):** Solid Homes (Seller) and Laserna/Cajipe (Buyers) for Lot 3, Block I, Phase II, Loyola Grand Villas, Quezon City (600 sqm). Total price: P172,260.00. Down payment + 3-year installment plan.
*   **Dispute:** Buyers claimed they paid 90% and demanded Deed of Sale and TCT. Seller alleged non-payment, considered contract rescinded.
*   **HLURB Proceedings:** Buyers filed a complaint for Delivery of Title and Execution of Deed of Sale with Damages (HLURB Case No. REM-073090-4511).
*   **HLURB Arbiter Decision:**  Ordered seller to execute Deed of Sale and TCT upon full payment by buyers, cease unauthorized fees.
*   **HLURB Board of Commissioners Decision:** Modified the Arbiter's decision, directing buyers to pay the remaining balance of P11,585.41 within 30 days, upon payment of the balance, the seller must execute and deliver the TCT.
*   **Office of the President Decision:** Affirmed HLURB Board's decision *in toto*, adopting by reference.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the OP's decision.

**Issues:**

1.  **Validity of OP Decision:**  Whether the OP's adoption by reference of the HLURB Board's findings violated Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution (requirement of stating facts and law in decisions).
2.  **Lack of Cause of Action:** Whether the buyers' complaint should have been dismissed for lack of cause of action because the purchase price wasn't fully paid.

**Holdings:**

1.  **Validity of OP Decision:**  The Supreme Court held that **Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution does not apply to decisions rendered in administrative proceedings.** The due process requirement is satisfied if the administrative decision is grounded on evidence and sufficiently informs the parties of its factual and legal bases (citing *Ang Tibay v. CIR*). While decisions of the Office of the President need not comply with the constitutional requirement, the Rules of Court may still find application, although suppletory only in character and apply only whenever practicable and convenient. *Permskul* conditions for valid "memorandum decisions" were met; HLURB decision was attached.
2.  **Lack of Cause of Action:**  HLURB Arbiter had discretion to proceed despite incomplete payment. The Buyers’ complaint didn’t totally lack a cause of action because the buyer has a right against the cancellation of the contract to sell and the forfeiture of the payments. Even if the payments were not complete, PD 957 and RA 6552 (Realty Installment Buyer Protection Act) govern the cancellation of the contract.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Buyers (Laserna/Cajipe):** Obligated to pay the remaining balance (P11,585.41).  The buyers' tender of payment was not a valid tender of payment due to the failure of the respondents to make consignation of the sum due.
*   **Seller (Solid Homes):** Obligated to execute Deed of Sale and deliver TCT upon full payment by the buyers. Solid Homes is unable to cancel the Contract to Sell because the requirements under Section 24, PD 957 and Section 4, RA 6552 or the Realty Installment Buyer Protection Act were not met.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Consignation:**  The Supreme Court noted the buyers' failure to consign the payment after the seller refused to accept the tender. This means technically, the obligation isn't discharged and interest may continue to accrue if the debt is outstanding. The ruling does not address the applicable interest.
*   **Remedies for Breach:** Document affirms the contract still stands.  A party may sue to enforce specific performance.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution, Article VIII, Section 14:** Form of judicial decisions.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 957:**  Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 6552:** Realty Installment Buyer Protection Act.
*   ***Ang Tibay v. CIR*, 69 Phil. 635 (1940):** Cardinal rights in administrative proceedings.
*   ***Yao v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 132428, 24 October 2000, 344 SCRA 202:** Validity of memorandum decisions.
*   ***Francisco v. Permskul*, G.R. No. 81006, 12 May 1989, 173 SCRA 324:** Conditions for valid memorandum decisions.
*    ***Ramos v. Sarao*, G.R. No. 149756, 11 February 2005, 451 SCRA 103:** Definition of Tender of Payment and Consignation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, finding no constitutional violation in the OP's decision and that while the buyer was technically in breach, the seller couldn't unilaterally rescind the contract due to statutory requirements of PD 957 and RA 6552.  The buyers must pay the balance. The seller must then transfer title.
