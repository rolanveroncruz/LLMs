**Legal Document Summary: Philharbor Ferries and Port Services, Inc. v. Francis C. Carlos (G.R. No. 266636)**

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court denying Philharbor's petition for review on certiorari, affirming the CA's decision, which affirmed the RTC's dismissal of Philharbor's complaint for damages against former COO Francis C. Carlos and ordering payment of damages and attorney's fees to Carlos.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Alleged Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Philharbor alleges Carlos breached his fiduciary duty as COO by acting with gross negligence and/or bad faith in approving capital expenditure for dry docking of vessels, resulting in financial losses. Specifically, actual expenditures for dry docking of M/V Maharlika Dos and M/V Maharlika Siete significantly exceeded the approved budgets.
*   **Carlos's Responsibilities:** Carlos was responsible for day-to-day activities, collaborating with the CEO, ensuring maximum profits, developing space-planning strategies, and implementing the Safety Management System. He was authorized to approve capital expenditures but had to seek approval for any disbursement.
*   **Company Procedure Compliance:** The RTC and CA found that Philharbor failed to prove that Carlos acted in bad faith or with gross negligence, and that internal procedures for approving capital project expenditures were followed. Key witness admitted to company procedure being followed.
*   **Business Judgment Rule:** The Supreme Court cites the business judgment rule, stating that courts should not substitute their judgment for that of corporate officers acting in good faith.
*   **Corporate Officer Liability (Section 31 of the Corporation Code):** The decision reiterates that directors, trustees, or officers are only liable for damages if they wilfully and knowingly vote for or assent to patently unlawful acts, or are guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation. *Ient v. Tullett Prebon (Philippines), Inc.* and *Strategic Alliance Development Corp. v. Radstock Securities Limited* are cited to support this point.
*   **Damages:** Carlos was awarded moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees based on Philharbor's malicious filing of a baseless complaint and publishing it in a newspaper, causing him emotional distress and damage to his reputation.

**Obligations:**

*   Philharbor is obligated to pay Carlos PHP 300,000.00 in moral damages, PHP 200,000.00 in exemplary damages, and PHP 100,000.00 in attorney's fees, plus 6% interest per annum from the date of finality of the SC decision until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   Philharbor incurred liability for damages due to the baseless complaint and its publication, which caused emotional suffering and reputational damage to Carlos.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Filing Baseless Claims:** The case highlights the risk of filing lawsuits without sufficient evidence of gross negligence or bad faith, which can expose the company to liability for damages and attorney's fees.
*   **Misunderstanding of Corporate Officer Liability:** There is a risk of misunderstanding the limits of corporate officer liability. Officers acting in good faith and within their authority are generally protected by the business judgment rule.
*   **Failure to Substantiate Claims:** Philharbor's failure to present clear and convincing evidence of negligence or bad faith was fatal to its case.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code of the Philippines (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68) and Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines (R.A. No. 11232):** Used to establish the duties and liabilities of corporate officers and the standards for holding them personally liable.
*   **Article 2219 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding moral damages.
*   **Article 2229 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding exemplary damages.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding Attorney's fees.
*   ***Strategic Alliance Development Corp. v. Radstock Securities Limited***: Three-fold duty of members of the board of directors.
*   ***Ient v. Tullett Prebon (Philippines), Inc.***: Section 31 of the Corporation Code: Liability of directors, trustees or officers.
*   ***Kho, Sr. v. Magbanua***: Explains when corporate veil may be pierced.
*   ***Cua, Jr. v. Tan***: the business judgment rule.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames***: 6% legal interest rate.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The precise scope of Carlos's authority and the specific internal procedures for approving capital expenditures were central to the dispute. The differing interpretations and factual findings by the trial court, CA, and SC suggest potential ambiguity in the operational implementation of these processes.
*   The definition of "gross negligence" and "bad faith" in the context of a corporate officer's actions remains a subject of interpretation. The SC's application of these standards in this case provides guidance but emphasizes the need for clear and convincing evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA's dismissal of Philharbor's complaint, holding that Philharbor failed to prove gross negligence or bad faith on the part of Carlos. The decision reinforces the protection afforded to corporate officers acting in good faith and within their authority under the business judgment rule. It also highlights the potential for liability when filing baseless claims that damage an individual's reputation and emotional well-being.
