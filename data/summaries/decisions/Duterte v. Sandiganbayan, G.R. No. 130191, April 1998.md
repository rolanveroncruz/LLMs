**Legal Document Summary: Duterte vs. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 130191, April 27, 1998**

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari seeking to set aside Sandiganbayan's denial of a Motion to Quash an information for violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioners, Rodrigo R. Duterte (then Mayor of Davao City) and Benjamin C. De Guzman (City Administrator), were deprived of their right to preliminary investigation and speedy disposition of the case.

**Facts:** The case stems from a negotiated contract for computer hardware and accessories between Davao City and Systems Plus, Inc. (SPI). The contract was allegedly overpriced, and lacked public bidding. The contract was later rescinded, and the downpayment was refunded. The Ombudsman filed an information against Duterte and De Guzman for entering into a contract manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Section 3(g) of R.A. 3019:** Prohibits public officers from entering into any contract or transaction on behalf of the government that is manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.
*   **Preliminary Investigation:** The Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman (A.O. No. 07) outlines the procedure for preliminary investigations. Crucially, requires the submission of complainant affidavits and affording respondents the opportunity to submit counter-affidavits.
*   **Right to Due Process:** Petitioners claimed their right to due process was violated due to procedural irregularities in the preliminary investigation.
*   **Right to Speedy Disposition of Cases:** Claim of violation of this right under Section 16, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, due to inordinate delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation.

**Court's Holding & Rationale:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition and DISMISSED the criminal case. The Court found that:

1.  **Defective Preliminary Investigation:** The Ombudsman failed to follow the procedure outlined in A.O. No. 07 for preliminary investigations. Petitioners were not furnished with complaint-affidavits and were only asked to comment, rather than file counter-affidavits. The Court emphasized the substantive nature of the right to preliminary investigation as a component of due process (citing *Doromal vs. Sandiganbayan*, 177 SCRA 354 (1980)).
2.  **Undue Delay:** The delay of four years in the termination of the preliminary investigation violated petitioners' right to a speedy disposition of their case, as guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court cited *Tatad vs. Sandiganbayan*, 159 SCRA 70 (1988) and *Angchangco, Jr. vs. Ombudsman*, 268 SCRA 301 (1997) to support this finding.
3.  **Lack of Factual Basis:** There was no existing contract at the time the complaint was filed and the Ombudsman issued its order, as the contract had already been rescinded.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Manifestly and Grossly Disadvantageous":** While the Court did not delve into the definition, it is key when invoking 3(g)RA 3019
*   **Application of *Tatad* Precedent:**The Ombudsman argued that the *Tatad* ruling (regarding political motivation) was not applicable. The Court disagreed, noting that the right to speedy disposition of cases is not contingent on political motivation.
*   **Impact of Rescission:** The Court emphasized the importance of rescission prior to the COA findings and complaint.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(g)**
*   **Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman), Rule II, Sections 2 & 4**
*   **Section 16, Article III of the 1987 Constitution**
*   **Doromal vs. Sandiganbayan, 177 SCRA 354 (1980)**
*   **Tatad vs. Sandiganbayan, 159 SCRA 70 (1988)**
*   **Angchangco, Jr. vs. Ombudsman, 268 SCRA 301 (1997)**
*   **Olivas vs. Office of the Ombudsman, 239 SCRA 283 (1994)**

**Conclusion:** This case reinforces the importance of adhering to procedural due process requirements during preliminary investigations.  It also clarifies that a substantial delay in resolving a preliminary investigation, regardless of political motivation, can violate the accused's constitutional right to a speedy disposition of the case.  Furthermore, it highlights the impact of rescission on an alleged violation of Section 3(g) of R.A. 3019. The court ruling hinged on the procedural errors during the preliminary investigation stage coupled with the fact that the contract had been rescinded.
