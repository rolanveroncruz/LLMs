## Legal Document Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines vs. West Negros College, Inc.*

**Nature:** Resolution on a dispute concerning the redemption price of foreclosed property.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Redemption Price:** The redemption price for West Negros College (WNC) to redeem the foreclosed property (originally mortgaged by Bacolod Medical Center - BMC and assumed by WNC) is the balance of BMC's debt to Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), plus expenses, and *interest computed as of the date of the public auction: August 24, 1989*.
*   **Cut-off Date for Interest:** DBP *cannot* collect interest accruing *after* August 24, 1989, for the purpose of determining the redemption price. This point was specifically addressed in the Supreme Court's (SC) rulings in G.R. No. 152359.
*   **DBP Possession:** DBP is deemed in *legal possession* of the property from the date of the foreclosure sale (August 24, 1989), effectively precluding further interest accrual.
*   **Internal Booking Policy:** DBP's internal policy (Board Resolution No. 0319) of not accruing interest after foreclosure is for internal bookkeeping only but must consider all interests in determining the redemption price.
*   **Remand Authority:** The Court of Appeals' (CA) authority upon remand was limited to determining the propriety of *compounded interest, penalties, and other charges*. It exceeded its authority by revisiting the reckoning date for interest computation, which had already been settled by the SC.

**Obligations:**

*   **WNC:** Obligated to pay the redemption price, computed as stated above, to redeem the property within the timeframe specified by prior SC rulings.
*   **DBP:** Obligated to allow redemption upon payment of the correctly computed redemption price.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for DBP if it incorrectly calculates the redemption price, potentially hindering WNC's redemption rights.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in E.O. No. 81, Section 16:** The current DBP charter, Executive Order (E.O.) No. 81, Section 16, omits the specific language of the prior law (Commonwealth Act No. 459, Section 31) explicitly calculating the redemption price, including "with interest on the total indebtedness at the rate agreed upon in the obligation from said date." This could be a source of future disputes, but the SC already interpreted it to mean interest calculation only until the auction date.
*   **Implementation of Remand:** Potential for further delays in the final resolution of the case if the CA misinterprets or fails to implement the SC's directives regarding the calculation of the redemption price.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **G.R. Nos. 152359 & 174103:** The primary case under consideration.
*   **G.R. No. 152359:** The original case where the SC ruled on the computation of the interest.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 459, Section 31:** The original DBP charter, now superseded but relevant for historical context and interpretation of redemption rights.
*   **Executive Order No. 81, Section 16:** The current DBP charter, dealing with redemption rights.
*   **DBP Board Resolution No. 0319:** Addresses the policy regarding interest accrual after foreclosure.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "all of the latter's (Bank's) claims against him, as determined by the Bank" in Section 16 of E.O. No. 81 could be interpreted broadly to include post-auction interest, but the SC clearly decided that the interest should be as of the date of public auction on 24 August 1989.

**Conclusion:**

The SC has definitively ruled that the interest calculation for the redemption price is capped at the date of the public auction (August 24, 1989). DBP is bound by this ruling, and WNC has the right to redeem the property by paying the amount calculated accordingly. Ensure compliance with the SC's mandate in G.R. No. 152359 and subsequent resolutions.
