## Legal Document Summary: Creser Precision Systems, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Floro International Corp.

**Case:** G.R. No. 118708, February 2, 1998 (349 Phil. 687)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which dismissed a complaint for injunction and damages filed by Creser Precision Systems, Inc. (Creser) against Floro International Corp. (Floro).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Patent Dispute:** Floro owns Letters Patent No. UM-6938 for an aerial fuze. Creser, claiming it developed a similar fuze earlier under the AFP's SRDP, sought an injunction against Floro to prevent the manufacture and sale of its patented fuze.
*   **Creser's Claim:** Creser alleges it is the "first, true, and actual inventor" of the fuze and that Floro's fuze is identical. Creser relied on Section 42 of the Patent Law (R.A. 165), arguing it has a "right, title, or interest" in the patented invention.
*   **Lower Court Injunction:** The trial court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Creser, preventing Floro from manufacturing/selling the fuze.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed, dismissing Creser's complaint.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Patentee's Rights:** Under Section 42 of R.A. 165, only the patentee (Floro) or its successors-in-interest can bring an infringement action.
*   **Creser's Lack of Standing:** Creser, lacking a patent or assignment of Floro's patent, has no cause of action for infringement.
*   **Remedy for Prior Inventor:** Creser's remedy was to file a petition for cancellation of Floro's patent with the Director of Patents within three years of publication (Section 28, R.A. 165), alleging Floro isn't the true inventor.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Missed Deadline for Cancellation:** The decision highlights that Creser failed to pursue its available remedy: a timely petition for cancellation of Floro's patent. This foreclosed its ability to challenge the patent's validity.
*   **Misinterpretation of Section 42:** Creser's reliance on Section 42, arguing it had a "right, title, or interest," was rejected. The court clarified this phrase applies only to the patentee's assignees or successors-in-interest.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 165 (Patent Law), Sections 10, 28, 42:** This statute is central to the dispute, defining patentee's rights, infringement actions, and patent cancellation procedures.
*   **Aguas vs. De Leon, 111 SCRA 238:** Affirms the presumption of validity of patents issued by the Philippine Patent Office and its expertise in determining patentability.
*   **American Jurisprudence:** While acknowledging some reliance by the petitioner to American Jurisprudence, the court finds it unavailing, emphasizing on Philippine statutory law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Right, title, or interest" (Section 42, R.A. 165):** Creser attempted to broaden the interpretation of this phrase to include prior inventors without a patent. The Court narrowly construed it, limiting it to assignees or successors-in-interest.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case clarifies that only a patentee or their successors-in-interest can bring an infringement action under Section 42 of R.A. 165. A party claiming to be the true inventor, but without a patent, lacks standing to sue for infringement. Their remedy is to seek patent cancellation within the statutory period. Creser's failure to do so bars its action. The case highlights the importance of timely pursuing available legal remedies and narrowly interprets the "right, title, or interest" language in infringement actions.
