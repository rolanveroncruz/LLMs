## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mara

**Case:** G.R. No. 184050, May 08, 2009 (Affirming CA Decision in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 00163)

**Subject:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. 7659).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Accused-appellant (Bienvenido Mara) found guilty of Murder for the death of Gaudencio Perater. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Treachery:** The qualifying circumstance of treachery was present in the attack, as it was sudden, unexpected, and without provocation, depriving the victim of any chance to defend himself. This is consistent with *People v. De Guzman* (G.R. No. 169082, August 17, 2007) and *People v. Glino* (G.R. No. 173793, December 4, 2007).
*   **Self-Defense:** Accused-appellant's claim of self-defense was rejected due to failure to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. Cites *People v. Abesamis* (G.R. No. 140985, August 28, 2007). The burden of proof for self-defense lies with the accused.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of Murder. Sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liability:** Required to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   Civil Indemnity: Php 50,000.00
    *   Actual Damages: Php 26,400.00
    *   Moral Damages: Php 50,000.00 (Art. 2219, Civil Code)
    *   Exemplary Damages: Php 25,000.00 (Art. 2230, Civil Code)

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The decision heavily relies on the credibility assessments of the trial court regarding the testimonies of Marcelino and Ramel Balos, which were given significant weight. This aligns with jurisprudence, and the Court deferred to the trial court's findings, referencing *People v. Roma* (G.R. No. 147996, September 30, 2005). The defense's lone testimony lacked corroboration, weakening its stance.
*   **Factual Determination of Treachery:** While the court found treachery, the defense challenged this point, alleging that the attack was not sudden and unexpected. The factual determination of treachery hinges on the specific circumstances of the case and the court's interpretation of the evidence.
*   **Lack of Unlawful Aggression:** The defense's reliance on self-defense hinged upon establishing unlawful aggression from the victim. Failure to do so fatally undermined their claim, emphasizing the importance of meeting the necessary elements to successfully plead self-defense.
