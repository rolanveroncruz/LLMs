**Case Summary: *Lino A. Fernandez, Jr. v. Manila Electric Company (MERALCO)*, G.R. No. 226002, June 25, 2018**

**Core Issue:** Propriety of NLRC's refusal to treat Fernandez's defective appeal (filed as a Notice of Appeal instead of a Verified Petition) as a Verified Petition assailing the Labor Arbiter's Order during execution proceedings and the computation of monetary awards due to Fernandez.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original CA Decision:** Declared Fernandez illegally dismissed and ordered MERALCO to reinstate him with backwages or, if reinstatement is infeasible, to pay separation pay. This decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court, becoming final and executory.
*   **LA Order (June 27, 2014):**
    *   Denied MERALCO's motion to declare full satisfaction of monetary awards.
    *   Denied Fernandez's motions for reinstatement and recomputation of backwages.
    *   Declared Fernandez legally separated from employment effective January 31, 2009.
    *   Ordered MERALCO to pay additional backwages and benefits per CBA computation (P1,950,525.53).
    *   Denied all other claims.
*   **Obligation to Reinstate/Pay Separation Pay:** MERALCO has the option to reinstate or pay separation pay. However, separation pay is only acceptable when reinstatement is infeasible.
*   **Backwages:** Due from date of illegal dismissal (September 14, 2000) until retirement (April 2009), subject to interest (12% per annum until June 30, 2013, then 6% per annum). Should include all benefits bonuses and general increases (Ocean East Agency Corp., et al., v. Lopez, 771 Phil. 179, 197 (2015)).
*   **Retirement Benefits:** Fernandez is entitled to retirement benefits even if he receives separation pay.
*   **No Attorney's Fees:** The final and executory CA Decision did not award attorney's fees, precluding a subsequent award.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **MERALCO's Liability:** Primarily liable for backwages, separation pay (if reinstatement is infeasible), and retirement benefits. Risk of increased monetary liability if reinstatement is deemed feasible, and backwages are calculated up to that point.
*   **Ambiguity regarding Feasibility of Reinstatement:** The main contentious point. MERALCO's claim of "strained relations" must be proven with substantial evidence per *Advan Motor, Inc. v. Veneracion, G.R. No. 190944, December 13, 2017*. The Court emphasized that the application of this doctrine will result in the deprivation of employment despite the absence of just cause.
*   **Incorrect Computation of Monetary Awards:** Risk of recomputation resulting in higher award if LA Suarez miscalculated amounts, if Fernandez can prove entitlement to longevity pay, 14th month, 15th month pay etc (must be confirmed based on employment contracts and CBA).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure (2011):** Rule XII (Extraordinary Remedies) used by Fernandez and Rule 5, Section 5, Rule 12 Section 1, and Section 15 regarding prohibited pleadings and the proper remedy being a Verified Petition to annul or modify orders of the LA during execution proceedings.
*   ***Velasco v. Matsushita Electric Philippines Corp.*, G.R. No. 220701, June 6, 2016:** Sets precedent for liberally construing procedural rules in labor cases and treating a defective appeal as a petition to modify or annul.
*   **Labor Code (Art. 298 & 299, formerly Art 283 & 284):** Governs payment of separation pay.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al.*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Establishes the applicable interest rates on monetary awards.
*   ***Advan Motor, Inc. v. Veneracion, G.R. No. 190944, December 13, 2017*** Doctrine of Strained Relations.
*   ***Ocean East Agency Corp., et al., v. Lopez, 771 Phil. 179, 197 (2015):** Computation of Backwages.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Strained Relations":** MERALCO's reliance on "strained relations" to avoid reinstatement. The Court requires *substantial evidence* to support this claim, not mere impression. Confidential position must be demonstrated, position must be one requiring complete trust.
*   **Feasibility of Reinstatement:**  The LA and NLRC did not sufficiently evaluate the factual basis for determining reinstatement infeasible.
*   **Entitlement to Benefits:** Fernandez's entitlement to various benefits (longevity pay, 14th/15th month pay) hinges on the applicable CBA/employment contract and company policies, requiring further evidentiary support.

**Potential Arguments/Recommendations:**

*   **Fernandez:** Argue for reinstatement given his expressed willingness and the lack of evidence of genuine "strained relations." Emphasize the need for MERALCO to *prove* the existence of strained relations. Push for a comprehensive recomputation of backwages and retirement benefits, including all applicable CBA provisions and company policies.
*   **MERALCO:** Produce substantial evidence of strained relations (if applicable and if truly existing). Argue that the passage of time has made reinstatement impractical, particularly if Fernandez's former position has been filled or significantly altered.
