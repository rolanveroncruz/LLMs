## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Grefaldia* (G.R. Nos. 121631-36)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Edgardo Grefaldia of six counts of murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** RTC convicted Grefaldia of six counts of murder based on the killings occurring on October 18, 1988, in Buenavista, Quezon. The trial court sentenced him to six *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay P50,000.00 to the heirs of each victim.
*   **Charges:** The Informations alleged that Grefaldia, armed with an armalite rifle, with intent to kill, treachery, and evident premeditation, wilfully and feloniously attacked and shot Juan Labatete, Maria Labatete, Rolando Ceda, Jesus Labatete, Tomasa Camacho, and Rogelio Maligaya, causing their deaths.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Grefaldia is obligated to serve six *reclusion perpetua* sentences.
*   He is liable to pay P50,000.00 to the heirs of each of the six victims, totaling P300,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Arguments on Appeal:**

*   **Challenge to Witness Testimony:** Appellant argues the trial court erred in crediting the prosecution witness Domingo Camacho's testimony, claiming inconsistencies and unreliability due to age and emotional state.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Appellant presented an alibi, claiming he was in Bicol at the time of the murders, but the court rejected it due to insufficient proof of impossibility of presence at the crime scene.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 14:** Defines treachery as an aggravating circumstance.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):**  The court found that the murders were qualified by treachery because the accused-appellant insured the execution of the crime without any risk to himself that may arise from the defense which the victims might make (People vs Cogonon, 262 SCRA 693).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "inconsistencies" in Domingo Camacho's testimony are deemed minor by the court, but appellant argues they undermine his credibility.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court **DISMISSED** the appeal and **AFFIRMED** the RTC decision in toto, upholding the conviction and penalties. The court emphasized that the positive identification by eyewitness Domingo Camacho was credible, corroborated by another witness, and superior to the defense of alibi. The court concluded that the prosecution had successfully proven the elements of murder, including treachery.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The positive identification by a witness known to the accused since childhood strengthens the prosecution's case.
*   The Supreme Court reiterated the trial court's advantage in assessing witness credibility due to their direct observation.
*   The prior filing of rape and robbery charges by some of the victims against the accused established a motive for the crime.
