**Case Summary: People v. Pajabera, G.R. No. 177162 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Pajabera charged with Murder for fatally stabbing Majen Bolanos with a "balisong" from behind, with treachery and evident premeditation. Note that evident premeditation was *not* proven.
*   **Defense:** Pajabera claimed self-defense. He alleged Bolanos attacked him with a bladed weapon after refusing to pay a cockfighting wager.
*   **Treachery:** The lower courts and Supreme Court found that the attack was qualified by treachery. The victim was unarmed and attacked from behind without warning.
*   **Penalty:** The lower courts sentenced Pajabera to *Reclusion Perpetua*. Supreme Court upheld it.

**Obligations:**

*   Pajabera has an obligation to serve the *Reclusion Perpetua* sentence, including the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.
*   Pajabera has an obligation to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and exemplary damages to the heirs of Bolanos.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Murder.
*   Civil liability for damages to the victim's heirs.

**Financial Damages:**

*   Civil Indemnity: ₱50,000
*   Moral Damages: ₱50,000
*   Temperate Damages: ₱25,000 (replaces initial ₱10,000 actual damages due to insufficient proof exceeding ₱25,000)
*   Exemplary Damages: ₱25,000 (due to the presence of treachery as an aggravating circumstance).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim Rejection:** Pajabera's self-defense claim was rejected based on the improbability of his version of events (victim stabbed in the shoulder during a grappling match while kneeling and stooping down).
*   **Witness Credibility:** The testimony of the defense witness, Habulin, was deemed unreliable due to inconsistencies and leading questions.
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts regarding witness credibility, highlighting that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness demeanor.

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder):** Defined and penalized.
