**Case Summary: *Luces v. Damole*, G.R. No. 150900, March 14, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. Affirms with Modification the CA's Decision, which affirmed the RTC's conviction of Petitioner for Estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Luces received Purchase Order (PO) cards from Damole to sell on commission under Trust Receipt Agreements (TRAs).
*   TRAs stipulated Luces held the PO cards and proceeds in trust for Damole, with an obligation to remit proceeds less commission or return unsold cards. Failure to remit or return gave rise to criminal and civil liability.
*   Luces initially complied, but later defaulted. Damole filed civil and criminal cases against her.
*   Luces claimed her liability was purely civil because the TRAs were contracts of sale. She also claimed a prejudicial question due to the pending civil case.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Trust Receipt Agreement (TRA):** Establishes a trust relationship with specific obligations on the Trustee (Luces).
*   **Obligations of Trustee (Luces):**
    *   Sell PO cards on behalf of Trustor (Damole).
    *   Remit proceeds less commission to Trustor.
    *   Hold PO cards and proceeds in trust for Trustor.
    *   Return unsold PO cards upon demand.
* **Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code** Establishes that fraud may be committed with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Convicted of Estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the RPC for misappropriating PO cards (using them personally or allowing relatives to use them without remitting proceeds) covered by Trust Receipt No. 4103, resulting in damage to Damole.
*   **Civil Liability:** Implicit due to the underlying transaction and the civil case filed by Damole.

**Reasoning and Case Law:**

*   **Elements of Estafa (Art. 315(1)(b) RPC):** Court found all elements present: receipt in trust, misappropriation/conversion, prejudice to another, and demand by offended party, citing *Asejo v. People, G.R. No. 157433, July 24, 2007*.
*   **Conversion/Misappropriation:** Using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or devoting it to a different purpose, citing *Tan v. People, G.R. No. 153460, January 29, 2007*. Using the PO cards as owner is conversion.
*   **Damage:** Deprivation of the right to enjoy proceeds of the sale.
*   **No Prejudicial Question:** The civil case (collection of sum of money) and the criminal case (estafa) involve distinct issues. Outcome of the civil case not determinative of guilt in the criminal case.

**Penalty:**

*   Indeterminate sentence of two (2) years, eleven (11) months and eleven (11) days of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to seven (7) years, eight (8) months and twenty-one (21) days of *prision mayor*, as maximum.
*   Court follows the Indeterminate Sentence Law [Act No. 4103 as amended by Act No. 4225]

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in TRA:** The TRA allows Petitioner to give PO to cardholders and receive a commission in the form of markup price with the trustee assuming the responsibility of paying the amount due including penalty on due dates. But the TRA also says that Trustee shall hold PO in storage as property of Trustor with the right to sell and hand the proceeds.
