**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Feliciano Ramos y Magpale*, G.R. No. 129439, September 25, 1998.

**Summary:** This is an automatic review of a death penalty imposed by the RTC for rape. Accused, the victim's father, was charged with simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) with the victim being a minor. The RTC imposed the death penalty based on relationship, not alleged in the information, as an aggravating circumstance.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Offense Charged:** Simple Rape (Article 335, RPC), with allegation of minority of the victim.

*   **Penalty Imposed by RTC:** Death.

*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*.

*   **Critical Legal Issue:** Whether the death penalty can be imposed when the qualifying circumstance of the father-daughter relationship (under RA 7659, amending Article 335) was NOT alleged in the information.

*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   The Court held that the father-daughter relationship and victim's minority constitute a *qualifying* circumstance that elevates simple rape to qualified rape, punishable by death.
    *   Because the information only charged simple rape, the accused was denied his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
    *   Relationship cannot be considered a generic aggravating circumstance in this case as it is a qualifying circumstance.
    *   Therefore, while the evidence supported the facts of the qualified rape, the accused could only be convicted of simple rape due to the pleading deficiency. *Reclusion Perpetua* is the appropriate penalty.

**Obligations:**

*   **Defendant:** Serve *reclusion perpetua* (20 years and 1 day to 40 years). Pay Php50,000 as indemnity, Php25,000 as moral damages, and Php25,000 as exemplary damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Pleading Deficiency:** The case underscores the importance of proper pleading. Failing to allege all elements and qualifying circumstances can result in a less severe penalty. This case is a good example of how the defendant escaped the death penalty because of failure to allege relationship in the information.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The court relied heavily on the testimony of the complainant, even with minor inconsistencies in her sworn statement.
*   **Voluntary Surrender & Plea of Guilt:** The Court dismissed arguments for mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender (because he was arrested) and plea of guilt after trial had begun (not timely).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659):** Defines rape and its penalties, including the qualified form when the victim is under 18 and the offender is a parent.
*   **Article 63, Revised Penal Code:** Applies a single indivisible penalty regardless of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.
*   **Section 14(2), Article III, Constitution:** Right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation.
*   **People vs. Garcia, G.R. No. 120093, November 6, 1997:** Clarifies the nature of the new attendant circumstances introduced by RA 7659.
*   **People vs. Prades, G.R. No. 127569, July 30, 1998.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether an element of the offense should be treated as aggravating or qualifying. In this instance, the relationship should have been considered as an element to qualify the case as qualified rape.
