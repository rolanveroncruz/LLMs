**Case Summary: *Nasipit Lumber Company, Inc. vs. National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC)*, G.R. No. 113097, April 27, 1998**

**Key Issue:** Validity of Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) guidelines on wage exemption issued without NWPC approval.

**Holding:** RTWPB guidelines on wage exemptions (Guideline No. 3) are invalid without NWPC approval. The power to prescribe rules and guidelines for wage determination rests with the NWPC, per RA 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act) amending the Labor Code.

**Facts:**

*   Nasipit Lumber, Philippine Wallboard, and Anakan Lumber applied for exemption from Wage Orders RX-01 and RX-01-A based on RTWPB Guideline No. 3, citing distress in the wood-processing industry.
*   RTWPB initially approved the exemption.
*   NWPC partially reversed, granting exemption only to Anakan Lumber, finding Guideline No. 3 invalid for lack of NWPC approval.
*   NWPC applied its own guidelines, requiring a 25% capital impairment for exemption, which only Anakan Lumber met.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 121, Labor Code (RA 6727):** Grants NWPC power to formulate wage policies and guidelines, and to prescribe rules for minimum wage determination.
*   **Art. 122, Labor Code (RA 6727):** Grants RTWPBs the power to issue wage orders and receive exemption applications *subject to NWPC guidelines*.
*   **NWPC Rules on Minimum Wage Fixing:** Requires RTWPBs to process exemption applications subject to NWPC guidelines.
*   **NWPC Guidelines on Exemption:** Specifies capital impairment threshold (25% loss) for exemption eligibility.

**Liabilities:**

*   Nasipit Lumber and Philippine Wallboard were ordered to pay wage increases retroactively, plus 1% monthly interest, due to the denial of their exemption applications.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith Reliance:** Argument that companies relied in good faith on RTWPB guidelines was rejected, as invalid guidelines cannot be a source of vested rights.
*   **Industry-Wide Exemption:** NWPC held that RTWPB Guideline No. 3's "distressed industry" criterion was an impermissible expansion of the law, as the Wage Order only mentioned "distressed establishments".
*   **Retroactivity:** Though petitioners argued for retroactive application of NWPC guidelines, the court rejected this claim because Guideline No. 3 was invalid from inception, so it can not be a source of vested rights.
*   **Labor Code Article 4:** This article states that doubts in implementation and interpretation of the Labor Code must be resolved in favor of labor. This was the basis for interpreting Wage Orders to not have a blanket exception for all entities in a distressed industry.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act):** Amended the Labor Code, establishing NWPC and RTWPBs and defining their powers.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Court of Appeals, 249 SCRA 149 (1995)***: Basic law prevails over implementing rules.
*   ***Cebu Oxygen & Acetylene Co., Inc. vs. Drilon, 176 SCRA 24 (1989)***: An administrative agency cannot amend an act of Congress.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   RTWPB Guideline No. 3, specifically the "distressed industry" criterion, which the NWPC found to be an unauthorized expansion of the exemption criteria.

**Legal Analysis & Advice:**

The Supreme Court's decision highlights the principle that administrative agencies can only exercise powers delegated to them by law.  RTWPBs must adhere to NWPC guidelines when deciding wage exemption applications. The Court is unwilling to allow regional boards to circumvent national wage policies by issuing inconsistent guidelines. Companies seeking wage exemptions must meet the strict capital impairment criteria set by the NWPC and should verify the validity of any RTWPB guidelines they rely upon. The decision also underscores the pro-labor policy of the Labor Code, which favors interpretations that benefit workers when there is doubt.
