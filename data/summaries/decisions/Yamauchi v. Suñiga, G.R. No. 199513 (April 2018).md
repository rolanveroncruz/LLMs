## Legal Document Summary: *Yamauchi v. Suñiga* (G.R. No. 199513)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding rescission of a renovation contract and award of damages.

**Facts:** Yamauchi (petitioner) contracted Suñiga (respondent) for house renovations. A dispute arose concerning the scope of work, costs, and completion. Yamauchi sued for rescission, alleging breach of contract and misrepresentation by Suñiga. The RTC granted rescission and awarded Yamauchi actual, moral, and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs. The CA affirmed the rescission but significantly reduced actual damages and deleted the awards for moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Yamauchi appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) only on the issue of damages.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Contract Rescission:** The core issue involves the rescission of a construction/renovation contract under Article 1191 of the Civil Code due to substantial breach of contract by Suñiga.
*   **Suñiga's Obligations:** Completion of renovations within agreed terms, honesty in billing, and acting as a competent contractor. Implicit obligation to possess the skills and certifications represented (or implied) to the client.
*   **Yamauchi's Obligations:** Payment for services rendered.
* **Damages** SC awards Yamauchi (1) P500,000.00, as temperate damages; (2) P50,000.00, as moral damages; (3) P50,000.00, as exemplary damages; and (4) Ten percent (10%) of the total amount awarded, as attorney's fees

**Liabilities:**

*   **Suñiga:** Liable for damages resulting from the rescission due to his breach of contract. The SC focuses on Suñiga's misrepresentation, inflated billing practices, and failure to complete the contracted work, rendering the house uninhabitable. He is now obligated to pay all of the damages awarded.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Precise Damage Quantification:** The SC acknowledged the difficulty in precisely quantifying Yamauchi's losses. It opted to award temperate damages (Article 2224, Civil Code) in lieu of actual damages due to the absence of concrete evidence of the pre- and post-renovation value of the house.
*   **Proof of Actual Damages:** This case reinforces the requirement for competent proof of actual damages. The failure to provide detailed evidence of the property's value before and after the incomplete renovations hampered Yamauchi's ability to recover full compensatory damages.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1191 of the Civil Code:** Basis for the rescission of the contract due to Suñiga's breach. This article allows the injured party to seek rescission and damages.
*   **Article 2199 of the Civil Code:** Specifies that one is entitled to adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss suffered as one has duly proved. This underscores the need for concrete evidence of damages.
*   **Article 2224 of the Civil Code:** Justification for the award of temperate damages when actual damages cannot be proven with certainty.
*   **Article 2208(1) of the Civil Code:** basis for the award of attorney's fees.
*   ***Adriano v. Lasala*, 719 Phil. 408 (2013):** Defines bad faith in contract law, requiring dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. This case is cited to support the award of moral damages due to Suñiga's actions.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Dictates the imposition of legal interest on monetary awards.

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **CA's Reasoning on Unjust Enrichment:** The CA argued that awarding full actual damages would result in unjust enrichment for Yamauchi, given the partial renovations. The SC overturned this reasoning, emphasizing that the incomplete renovations rendered the house uninhabitable, providing no benefit to Yamauchi.
*   **Suñiga's Misrepresentation:** The SC gave significant weight to Suñiga's misrepresentation of himself as a licensed architect, which constituted bad faith and justified the award of moral damages.

**Overall Assessment:**

This case highlights the importance of clearly defining the scope of work, obtaining accurate cost estimates, and diligently supervising construction/renovation projects. More importantly, it showcases the need for meticulous documentation and competent evidence to support claims for actual damages in contract disputes. The SC's decision emphasizes that fraudulent misrepresentation and bad faith in contractual dealings warrant the award of moral and exemplary damages.
