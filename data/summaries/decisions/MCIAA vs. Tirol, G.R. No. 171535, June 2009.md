**Legal Document Summary: Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority vs. Spouses Edito and Merian Tirol and Spouses Alejandro and Miranda Ngo (G.R. No. 171535)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the trial court's order in a quieting of title case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Edito and Merian Tirol and Spouses Alejandro and Miranda Ngo

**Key Issue:** Determination of superior right to Lot No. 4763-D, Opon Cadastre.

**Background:**

*   Respondents claim ownership via a Deed of Absolute Sale from Elma Jenkins, who had a Transfer Certificate of Title.
*   MCIAA claims prior ownership via a Deed of Absolute Sale from the original owners, spouses Julian Cuison and Marcosa Cosef, dating back to 1958.
*   MCIAA's registration of the deed was under Act No. 3344, not Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision in favor of the Respondents.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MCIAA's obligation (Deed of Absolute Sale):** To reconstitute the lost title of Lot 4763 at its own expense.
*   **MCIAA's Obligation Under Land Registration Act:** To correctly register the deed in accordance with Act 496.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **MCIAA's Loss of Property Rights:** The Court held that Respondents' title is superior.
*   **MCIAA's Negligence:** Failure to reconstitute the title or properly register the deed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1544, New Civil Code (Double Sales):** Held inapplicable because the sales were initiated by successive vendors, not a single vendor. Referenced *Cheng v. Genato* and *Spouses Ong, et al. v. Spouses Olasiman.*
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Governing law for registered lands. Specifically, Section 50 specifies that the act of registration is the operative act to convey and affect the land.
*   **Act No. 3344:** Provides for the recording of transactions over unregistered real estate. Registration under this act does not bind a third party with a better right. Referenced *Radiowealth Finance Co. v. Palileo.*
*   ***Amodia Vda. de Melencion, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.*** - Reaffirms that the sale should have been registered under Act 496 and not Act 3344.
*   ***Soriano, et al. v. The Heirs of Domingo Magali*** - Registration must be done in the proper registry in order to effect and bind the land.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Improper Registration:** MCIAA's registration under Act No. 3344 was deemed insufficient for registered land; registration under Act No. 496 was required. Therefore, MCIAA's registration did not operate as constructive notice.
*   **Failure to Reconstitute Title:** MCIAA's failure to reconstitute the lost title was deemed negligent. Cites *Amodia Vda. de Melencion.*
*   **Good Faith Purchasers:** Respondents were considered innocent purchasers for value and in good faith.
*   **Diligence of Respondents:** The Court determined that they exercised due diligence in verifying the title of the subject property.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The deed of absolute sale was registered under Act No. 3344 instead of Act No. 496.
*   Whether a deed of absolute sale should be registered under Act No. 496 even when the original Certificate of Title was lost or destroyed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Future disputes arising from improper registration.
*   Liability for failing to properly register the deed for decades.
