## Legal Document Summary: De Ocampo v. Rey, G.R. No. 169657 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari concerning conflicting claims to lots within the Villamor Airbase Housing Project (VAHP).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **VAHP Policy Guidelines:** Establishes criteria for awarding lots, disqualifying absentee house owners (AHOs), and prioritizing occupants/lessees for awards (pars. 3.4, 5.2, 5.1). Includes a right of pre-emption for renters of structures being sold by disqualified owners (par. 4.21). Outlines an appeal process to the Executive Committee en banc for decisions of the Awards and Arbitration Committee (AAC) (par. 11.2).
*   **AAC Recommendation (1996):** Recommends disqualification of Rodolfo Ambata (AHO) and proposes allocation of Lots 13 and 21 among several renters, including De Ocampo and Rey.
*   **Special Power of Attorney (SPA):** Ambata grants Moore the authority to sell the house with Tag No. 95-3-0094.
*   **Sale:** Moore, acting under the SPA, sells the house to Rey.
*   **NHA Modification:** Initially, the AAC's recommendation was reviewed and affirmed. Later, NHA modified allocation giving De Ocampo 150 sq m of Lot 13 and reducing Rey's allocation from 50 sq m to 30 sq m in Lot 21.

**Obligations:**

*   **Ambata:** Obligated to dispose of property to qualified renters due to AHO status.
*   **NHA/Executive Committee:** Obligated to follow VAHP policy guidelines in awarding lots.

**Liabilities:**

*   **De Ocampo:** Potential liability to Rey if the original AAC recommendation is upheld, potentially impacting awarded lot size.
*   **Ambata Estate/Moore:** Potential liability if the SPA was improperly exercised or Rey's pre-emption rights were violated.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **VAHP Policy Interpretation:** Disagreement on the proper interpretation of the VAHP policy guidelines regarding award procedures, pre-emption rights, and the authority of the NHA versus the Executive Committee. The Court finds that the Executive Committee's authority supersedes the NHA in this particular instance, impacting the allocation of lots and potentially creating inconsistencies in similar cases where the NHA has acted.
*   **Procedural Defects:** Failure to properly notify Rey of the sale of the property (potentially violating his pre-emption rights) and non-compliance with the VAHP appeal process.
*   **Ambiguity of Authority:** The roles and responsibilities of each committee are not well defined in the documents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (petition for review on certiorari), Rule 43 (appeal to the CA).
*   **VAHP Policy Guidelines:** The central legal framework. Specific paragraphs cited are crucial: 3.4, 4.21, 5.1, 5.2, 11.2.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (1995):** Joint agreement by the Bases Conversion Development Authority, Department of National Defense, City Government of Pasay and the NHA for the implementation of the VAHP.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Par. 11.2 of the VAHP guidelines:** The ambiguity lies in whether the NHA's review and modification of the AAC recommendation is proper without the Executive Committee's involvement. The CA and SC ruled this was not in compliance with appeal process to the Executive Committee en banc.
*   **Right of Pre-emption (par. 4.21):** Whether Rey was properly notified of the sale and given the opportunity to exercise his pre-emption right.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with the CA decision that the AAC recommendation must be upheld due to non-compliance with the appeal procedures to the Executive Committee en banc. This creates a potential issue of Rey's pre-emption rights not being satisfied. Key issues revolve around the interpretation and adherence to VAHP guidelines, potentially creating a cause of action for Rey to challenge the sale or seek compensation.
