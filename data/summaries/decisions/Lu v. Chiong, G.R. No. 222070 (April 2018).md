## Legal Document Summary: *Lu v. Chiong*, G.R. No. 222070

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's order granting a judge's voluntary inhibition.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in reversing the RTC's inhibition order, given that the main actions (SEC Cases No. 99-2014-C and 100-2014-C, shareholder disputes concerning Remcor and Soutech) had already been resolved on the merits by another branch of the RTC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted the petition, reversed the CA decision, and dismissed the respondents' CA petition on the ground of mootness.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Mootness:** The SC held that the promulgation of a consolidated decision by RTC Branch 35 (dealing with the underlying Stockholders dispute) resolving the main issues rendered the CA petition (questioning the inhibition order) moot. The consolidated decision was issued while the petition was pending, and the CA's subsequent order to return the case for speedy trial was rendered of no practical effect.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC reiterated that jurisdiction was vested in the RTC as a whole, not individual branches. Therefore, Branch 35 had jurisdiction to proceed notwithstanding the pending CA petition challenging the Branch 34 inhibition order.
*   **Voluntary Inhibition (Rule 137, Rules of Court):** While the CA initially reversed based on a lack of valid reasons for inhibition, the SC did not rule on the merits of this issue due to the finding of mootness.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 137, Rules of Court:** Relates to disqualification and inhibition of judges.
*   **King vs. CA, 514 Phil. 465 (2005):** Cited for the principle of mootness.
*   **Trajano v. Uniwide Sales Warehouse Club, 736 Phil. 264, 276 (2014):**  Confirmed the authority of RTC Branch 35 to act, even though the special civil action was still pending with the Court of Appeals

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Challenges:** There was a question of whether certiorari was the correct remedy to question the order granting inhibition of a judge.

**Implications:** This case highlights the importance of timing and the principle of mootness in legal proceedings.  It also clarifies that appeals relating to preliminary or procedural issues cannot supersede rulings on the main issue by a co-equal court.
