**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Kidnapping of Antonio R. Tan for ransom. Accused demanded US$2,000,000.00.
*   **Accused Roles:** Arsenal, Acervo, and Trespeces acted in concert. Arsenal led police to the victim. Trespeces was identified as "Jose," the main negotiator. Acervo was identified as the "higher authority" negotiator.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Strong circumstantial evidence connecting accused to the crime. Appellants were seen at the location where calls were traced. The car they occupied was followed to the victimâ€™s staged ransom drop.
*   **Accomplices:** Perez and Yson, identified as guards, were convicted as accomplices. Saria was acquitted.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Voice Identification:** Accused challenged the voice identification by Johnny Tan. The court found that his frequent conversations with the kidnappers were sufficient for recognition, even without expertise.
*   **Admissibility of Arsenal's Cooperation:** Accused claimed that Sgt. Arsenal's cooperation (leading police to the victim) was inadmissible due to lack of counsel. The court dismissed this, stating that the conviction did not depend on it.
*   **Alibi:** The accused claimed to be on a legitimate police mission. This alibi was deemed a ruse and rejected by the court because of inconsistencies and lack of evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
