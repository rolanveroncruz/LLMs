## Legal Document Summary: *Eric L. Lee vs. Hon. Henry J. Trocino, et al.* (G.R. No. 164648)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision dismissing petitions for indirect contempt and prohibition/certiorari relating to Civil Cases Nos. 754 and 1088 in RTC Bago City, Br. 62.

**Key Provisions and Background:**

*   **Civil Case No. 754:**  Magdaleno Peña (respondent) sued Urban Bank, Eric Lee (petitioner), and others for recovery of agent's compensation, expenses, damages, and attorney's fees based on an alleged agency agreement. The RTC ruled in favor of Peña.
*   **Execution Pending Appeal:**  Peña obtained a Special Order and Writ of Execution pending appeal (CA-G.R. CV No. 65756). Lee challenged this via certiorari (CA-G.R. SP No. 55667), initially securing a TRO and a decision annulling the execution.
*   **CA Reversal:** CA reversed itself, granting Peña's motion for reconsideration and reinstating the execution pending appeal. The CA directed Peña to post an indemnity bond of P15M.
*   **Stay Order & Supersedeas Bond:** The CA then issued a Stay Order conditioned on a P40M supersedeas bond by Lee. This bond was approved, staying execution against Lee, de Leon, and Gonzales.
*   **Execution Sales Despite Stay:**  Prior to the Stay Order, but after CA's Amended Decision, Peña levied and sold Lee's properties, including shares in EQLPI, at public auction.
*   **Civil Case No. 1088:**  Peña filed a separate action to compel EQLPI to transfer Lee's shares to his name after EQLPI refused to do so. Lee argued this violated the Stay Order.
*   **Twin Petitions (CA-G.R. SP No. 65023):** Lee filed petitions in the CA for indirect contempt against Peña and the sheriff and for prohibition/certiorari against the RTC, seeking to annul proceedings in Civil Case No. 1088 and enjoin further execution in Civil Case No. 754.
*   **Concurrent G.R. No. 145822:** Lee had previously filed a Petition for Review with the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 145822) on the same subject matter. Peña's motion to dismiss based on forum shopping was denied.
*   **CA Decision (Assailed):** CA dismissed Lee's petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 65023, citing forum shopping and *litis pendentia*. The CA was reversed by the Supreme Court on the ruling of Forum Shopping but affirmed that there was no subsisiting execution.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Peña's potential liability on the indemnity bond:**  The Supreme Court mentioned only Peña's indemnity bond as a means for Lee to recover properties sold during the execution sale.
*  **Potential Liability of EQLPI:** The Supreme Court ordered EQLPI to transfer the shares of stocks to Peña and his assignees. 

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Execution Sales:**  The crucial point is the validity of the execution sales that occurred *after* the CA's Amended Decision reinstating execution pending appeal but *before* the approval of Lee's supersedeas bond. The Supreme Court held that all executions, garnishments, and levies of Lee's properties proceeding from the Special Order and the Writ of Execution are presumed regular during that window, and since there is no right to redeem personal property, the rights of ownership are vested to the purchaser at the execution sale.
*   **Indirect Contempt:** Lee alleges that Peña and the sheriff acted in contempt of court by proceeding with the levy and execution while the January 12, 2000, decision of the appellate court was valid and effective.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Sections 3 and 4, Rules of Court:**  Governs execution, execution pending appeal, and supersedeas bonds.
*   **Rule 41, Section 9(3), Rules of Court:**  Governs the loss of jurisdiction by the trial court upon perfection of appeal.
*   ***Imperial v. De la Cruz***: The rule that when the appellate court promulgates the August 18, 2000 Amended Decision reversing the January 12, 2000 decision, it necessarily follows that the latter verdict was automatically deemed vacated. It ceased to exist in contemplation of law
*   ***Urban Bank, Inc. v. Peña, A.C. No. 4863***: The Supreme Court already determined the validity of the execution, and this ruling cannot be disturbed.
*   ***Paray v. Rodriguez***: The rule that since there is no right to redeem personal property, the rights of ownership are vested to the purchaser at the execution sale and are not entangled in any suspensive condition that is implicit in a redemptive period.
*   **Republic Act No. 8791:** General Banking Law of 2000
*   ** *Philippine Nails and Wires Corporation v. Malayan Insurance Company, Inc.* **Impending insolvency of the adverse party constitutes good ground for execution pending appeal
*   ** *Cebu Contractors Consortium Company v. Court of Appeals* **When a motion for execution pending appeal is filed within the reglementary period for perfecting an appeal, the court must hear and resolve the motion for it would become part of the records to be elevated on appeal. Since the court has jurisdiction to act on the motion at the time it was filed, said jurisdiction continues until the matter is resolved and is not lost by the subsequent action of the opposing party.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "duly implemented" in the sheriff's return. Lee argues this means the judgment was satisfied in full, but the Court disagrees.
* The court's statement that "*notwithstanding his victory in the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 65756, he could no longer recover the personal properties sold at execution sale, except only upon Peña's indemnity bond*". This is a contentious point given that his appeal was successful, and this requires futher exploration. 

**Overall Assessment:**

Lee's arguments are mostly without merit. The key is that the CA had already reversed its initial decision and allowed for execution. The burden was on Lee to prevent that with a bond.

**Recommendations:**

*   Further investigate whether there were irregularities in the execution process that could invalidate the sales that occurred during the window of opportunity.
*   Further explore Lee's success in the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 65756.
