**Legal Document Summary: *Quiño v. Court of Appeals***

**Case Citation:** 353 Phil. 449 (G.R. No. 118599, June 26, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** This is a petition contesting the Court of Appeals' decision regarding the right of redemption of an agricultural tenant under RA No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code), as amended by RA No. 6389.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sec. 11, RA No. 3844:**  Right of preemption of agricultural tenant if land is sold. Requires written notice of the sale to the tenant.
*   **Sec. 12, RA No. 3844:**  Right of redemption of agricultural tenant if land is sold to a third person without the tenant's knowledge.  Tenant has 180 days from *written* notice by the *vendee* (new owner) upon registration of the sale, to redeem at a reasonable price.

**Facts:**

*   Galans sold land to Leonardos in 1974 without notice to Quiño, the alleged tenant since 1951.
*   Quiño filed for redemption in 1986 after learning of the sale.
*   Leonardos sold the land to Bitoon in 1986.
*   Quiño amended his complaint to include Bitoon.
*   Trial court dismissed the complaint, finding no tenancy relationship.
*   Court of Appeals reversed, finding tenancy existed but held that Quiño could only exercise his right of redemption if Bitoon decided to sell the land, citing *Velasquez v. Nery*.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* Quiño's petition. While the CA correctly found a tenancy relationship, Quiño failed to validly exercise his right of redemption due to inadequate consignation of the redemption price (only the original sale price, not Bitoon's purchase price, was consigned).

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Original Landowners (Galans):** Failed to notify the tenant of the sale, potentially triggering liability for violating right of preemption.
*   **Vendee (Leonardos):** Liable to provide adequate notice to tenant and allow tenant to exercise right of redemption before subsequent sales.
*   **Subsequent Vendee (Bitoon):** Generally subrogated to obligations of prior landowners regarding tenant's rights, specifically the right of redemption provided proper written notice is given.
*   **Tenant (Quiño):** Obligation to make a proper offer to redeem, including consigning the full redemption price equivalent to the acquisition price.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Written Notice":** The court clarifies that a mere letter informing of the sale is insufficient. The written notice must contain the terms, particulars and validity of sale. Obtaining a certified copy of the deed of sale is acceptable.
*   **Insufficient Consignation:**  Failure to consign the full reasonable price, will defeat the right of redemption.
*   **Incorrect Application of *Velasquez v. Nery***: The CA misapplied the *obiter dictum* in *Velasquez*. The SC clarified that  the condition for future transfer from PNB, was that the *transferee* must allow redemption, not that redemption is only available *if and when* the land is transferred in the future.
*   **Proof of tenancy:** The ruling confirms that proving all essential elements of a tenancy relationship is required.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):**  Governs tenancy relationships and rights of preemption and redemption.
*   **RA No. 6389:** Amended RA No. 3844.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Velasquez v. Nery***:  Distinguished regarding the interpretation of the *obiter dictum* concerning the PNB and subsequent transferees to show the tenant still has a chance to redeem on subsequent transfers.
*   ***Conejero v. Court of Appeals***:  Defined the purpose of the written notice required for redemption.
*   ***Lee Chuy Realty Corporation v. Court of Appeals***:  Defined how an offer to redeem can be properly effected
*   ***Belisario v. IAC***: Defined what should be done when an intention to repurchase

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reasonable Price:**  The Court deferred to the actual sale price between the Leonardos and Bitoon. However, "reasonable price" could be subject to further litigation if there were evidence of inflated or manipulated pricing.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **Strict Compliance:** Parties must strictly comply with the requirements of RA 3844, particularly regarding written notice and proper tender/consignation of the redemption price.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Tenant carries the burden of proving the existence of a valid tenancy relationship and their right to redeem the property.
*   **Importance of Consignation:** Consigning the full acquisition price is essential to a valid exercise of the right of redemption.
