## Legal Document Summary: *Solpia Marine vs. Postrano* (G.R. No. 232275)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision to award permanent total disability benefits to a seafarer.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Solpia Marine and Ship Management, Inc. (Employer)
*   **Respondent:** Michael V. Postrano (Seafarer/Employee)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** POEA-approved 10-month contract for Postrano as able seaman.
*   **Injury:** Fractured right hand and wound on left hand sustained during work on December 9, 2012.
*   **Medical Treatment:** Treatment in Indonesia, Korea, then referral to company-designated physician (YGEIA Medical Center) in the Philippines upon repatriation on January 1, 2013.
*   **Physical Therapy:** Prescribed and initially followed, then allegedly abandoned by Postrano after March 14, 2013 despite being instructed to continue and return for follow-up.  He underwent additional sessions but did not return.
*   **Independent Assessment:**  Postrano obtained an independent medical assessment indicating Grade 9 disability.
*   **Dispute:** Postrano claims permanent total disability due to the lapse of the 120/240-day period without a definitive assessment by the company-designated physician. He argued financial constraints prevented further compliance.
*   **Employer's Argument:** Postrano's failure to return for follow-up after physical therapy completion prevented the company-designated physician from completing assessment, therefore not liable for permanent disability benefits.
*   **Lower Courts:** The Labor Arbiter and NLRC initially dismissed the claim, finding that Postrano prematurely sought an independent assessment. The CA reversed, citing the lack of a definitive impediment rating from the company-designated physician.

**Ruling of the Supreme Court:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, REVERSING the CA decision.  It found that:

*   Postrano failed to comply with the mandatory reporting requirements, preventing the company-designated physician from assessing his condition.
*   The 120/240-day period is relevant, but Postrano's actions (or lack thereof) hampered the process.  *New Filipino Maritime Agencies, Inc., et al. v. Despabeladeras, 747 Phil. 626, 640 (2014)* supports this.
*   Postranoâ€™s failure to complete treatment is a breach of his duties under Section 20(D) of the POEA-SEC and negates payment of disability benefits, citing *Splash Philippines, Inc., et al. v. Ruizo, 730 Phil. 162 (2014).*
*   Although not entitled to permanent total disability benefits, Postrano *is* entitled to income benefit for temporary total disability for 218 days (Jan 1, 2013 to Aug 7, 2013, the date of his last sanctioned therapy session).

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer:** Liable for income benefit for temporary total disability (218 days) and reimbursement of medical/transportation expenses (P33,998.96). Joint and several liability with Daebo Ship Management Co., Ltd.
*   **Employee:** Obligated to comply with the mandatory reporting requirements and complete medical treatment, or face forfeiture of benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Completion of Treatment":**  The lack of a clear definition of "completion of treatment" and follow-up timelines in the POEA-SEC can create uncertainty. While the SC emphasized the need for a definitive assessment from the company-designated physician, the circumstances regarding the seafarer's "abandonment" were highly scrutinized.
*   **Financial Constraints as Defense:** Postrano's claim of financial constraints, while mentioned, was not given significant weight.  However, the court's disregard of this argument could be challenged, especially if the employer failed to provide adequate financial assistance for medical treatment.
*   **Balancing Act:** The Court acknowledged the importance of the company-designated physician's assessment but also awarded temporary disability despite the physician not issuing a final rating. This highlights the balancing act courts perform between upholding contractual obligations and protecting the welfare of seafarers.
*   **Case Law Considerations:** The court relies heavily on *New Filipino Maritime Agencies, Inc., et al. v. Despabeladeras* and *Splash Philippines, Inc., et al. v. Ruizo,* underscoring the precedent of requiring diligent completion of treatment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 192(c)(1):**  Defines permanent disability.
*   **Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation (AREC), Rule VII, Sec. 2(b) & Rule X, Sec. 2:**  Defines total and permanent disability and period of entitlement.
*   **POEA-SEC, Sec. 20(3) & 20(D):**  Deals with compensation/benefits for injury/illness and limitations based on seafarer's actions.

**Potential Arguments (For Postrano):**

*   **Good Faith Effort:** Postrano may argue he made a good faith effort to comply with treatment, and the brief period of non-compliance shouldn't negate all benefits.
*   **Constructive Assessment:** The long passage of time and the lack of a conclusive assessment from the company-designated physician could be argued as constructive assessment of disability, even if not explicitly stated.
*   **Disproportionate Penalty:** Forfeiture of *all* disability benefits may be viewed as a disproportionate penalty for the alleged abandonment, especially if the employer did not actively follow up or address Postrano's financial concerns.
