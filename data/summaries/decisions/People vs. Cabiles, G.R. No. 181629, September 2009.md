## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cabiles, G.R. No. 181629 (2009)

**Case Overview:** This is a review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Elizardo Cabiles for rape of his minor niece. The CA modified the RTC's original death penalty to *reclusion perpetua* and adjusted the award of damages. The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the CA decision with a further modification on the awarded damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Cabiles was charged with rape under the Revised Penal Code, alleging force, threat, and intimidation (use of a knife) to have carnal knowledge of his 9-year-old niece, AAA.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** AAA testified that Cabiles lured her and her sister, then threatened her with a knife and raped her.  She delayed reporting due to fear of Cabiles' threats to kill her and her father.
*   **Defense's Version:** Cabiles denied the accusation, claiming he was in a different location (Diwalwal) at the time of the alleged crime. He further alleged a strained relationship with AAA's father due to a land dispute and with AAA herself due to her "unbecoming conduct".
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Cabiles guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced him to death.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed conviction but reduced the sentence to *reclusion perpetua*, reasoning that minority and relationship by consanguinity were not duly established, and the use of a knife already qualified the rape. The CA also modified the civil aspect of the case.
*   **SC Decision:** Affirmed the CA decision with modification to the civil indemnity and moral damages.

**Obligations:**

*   Cabiles has an obligation to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Cabiles has a financial obligation to pay AAA P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P30,000 as exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the rape.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Reporting:** The defense argued the four-year delay in reporting the rape incident casts doubt on AAA's credibility. The Court addressed this using precedent, citing *People v. Sandico* (1999), and *People v. Malagar* (1994), justifying the delay based on fear and threats, which is a common challenge in rape cases.
*   **Proof of Aggravating Circumstances:** The CA found the use of the knife as an aggravating circumstance that qualified the rape, despite the trial court finding that neither AAA's minority nor her relationship by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree to appellant has been duly established.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case hinged heavily on the credibility of AAA's testimony. The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment, citing the detailed nature of the account.
*   **Damage award modification:** SC reduced Civil indemnity and moral damages to P50,000 based on People v. Labiano, implying earlier award was excessive.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Rape):** The primary law under which Cabiles was charged.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004):**  Cited regarding the protection of the victim's identity.
*   **People v. Sandico, G.R. No. 128104 (1999):** Addressed the issue of delayed reporting of rape.
*   **People v. Malagar, G.R. Nos. 98169-73 (1994):** Also addressed the issue of delayed reporting of rape.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87 (2004):** procedural in nature.
*   **People v. Labiano, G.R. No. 145338 (2003):** Concerning the award of damages in rape cases.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   The inconsistency in record about correct spelling of the Appellantâ€™s first name, ultimately ruled as "Elizardo".
*   The exact nature of AAA's relationship to Cabiles, and whether it would constitute an aggravating circumstance, appears to be a point of contention resolved by the CA.
* The conflicting testimonies on the exact location of BBB and his family, as well as those of the defendant.
