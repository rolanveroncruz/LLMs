## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Bauit*

**Case Citation:** *People of the Philippines v. Carlos Bauit y Delos Santos*, G.R. No. 223102, February 14, 2018 (826 Phil. 166)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the conviction of the accused-appellant for Qualified Rape under Art. 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of Republic Act No. 8353 (Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** SC affirmed the CA and RTC rulings, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his biological daughter.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The SC emphasized the trial court's advantage in assessing witness credibility. The victim's (AAA's) testimony was found to be straightforward, clear, and convincing.
*   **Elements of Rape Established:** The prosecution sufficiently established the elements of rape under Art. 266-A, par. 1, RPC (as amended). The SC found the accused, by means of force, had carnal knowledge of his daughter.
*   **Aggravating/Qualifying Circumstances:** Twin qualifying circumstances of the minority of the victim and her blood ties to the accused-appellant was the basis of the sentence.
*   **Medico-Legal Evidence:** The SC rejected arguments based on discrepancies in the medico-legal report (healed lacerations predating the reported incident), emphasizing the victim's testimony is paramount and medical evidence is merely corroborative. *People v. Rubio*, 683 Phil. 714, 726-727 (2012) (medical exam not indispensable).

**Obligations:**

*   Accused to serve a sentence of Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole (per R.A. 9346).

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for qualified rape.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The defense's arguments regarding physical impossibility (house layout, adjacent rooms) and the time of injuries were rejected as not impacting the victim's credibility.
*   **Defense Arguments Rejected:** Alibi, claims of fabrication, and challenges to victim's character were deemed insufficient to overcome the victim's credible testimony and the prosecution's evidence.
*   **No ambiguous or contentious clauses** are identified in the context of the final decision, with the penalty conforming to the relevant statutes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of Republic Act No. 8353** (Rape Definition & Penalty)
*   **Art. 266-B of the RPC** (Penalties for Rape - considers aggravating circumstances)
*   **Republic Act No. 9346** (Prohibiting Imposition of Death Penalty - results in *reclusion perpetua* without parole)

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the conviction based on a clear and convincing testimony from the victim and applied the relevant statutory provisions.
