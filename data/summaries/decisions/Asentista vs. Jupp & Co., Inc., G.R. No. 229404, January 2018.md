**Legal Document Summary: *Asentista v. JUPP & Company, Inc.* (G.R. No. 229404)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision reversing NLRC's order for JUPP to pay Marilyn Asentista unpaid sales commissions.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Unpaid Sales Commissions:** Asentista claims unpaid commissions totaling P210,077.95.  The central issue is whether she is entitled to these commissions, given the silence of her employment agreement.
    *   *Case Law:* The Supreme Court (SC) cites *Toyota Pasig, Inc. v. De Peralta* and *Iran v. NLRC* to support the inclusion of commissions as part of wages under Section 97(f) of the Labor Code. These commissions are deemed direct remunerations for services rendered.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The employer (JUPP) bears the burden of proving payment of wages and benefits, not the employee (Asentista), *De Guzman v. NLRC*, the SC noted the need for proof on the part of JUPP to substantiate payments and entitlements.
*   **Car Plan Deductions:** JUPP deducted P113,000 (participation) and P68,721.36 (rental) from Asentista's commissions for a company vehicle. The issue is whether these deductions are valid absent an express agreement.
    *   *Case Law:* *Locsin v. Mekeni* is cited, holding that absent specific terms governing a car plan, the employer cannot retain installment payments as rent if the employee ceases employment.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The SC finds that JUPP committed unjust enrichment when it allowed Asentista to use the vehicle to further the performance of her function as a sales agent then unilaterally, without any consent, deduct car participation and amortization payment to Asentista's sales commission, to the latter's prejudice. Applying the guiding principles explicated in Locsin.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   JUPP is obligated to pay Asentista P210,077.95 in unpaid sales commissions, plus 10% attorney's fees.
*   JUPP is liable for legal interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.
*   The Court is applying Article 22 of the New Civil Code.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Admission of Discretionary Commission:** JUPP's admission in its position paper about discretionary commissions weakens its denial of Asentista's entitlement. This admission is critical to the SC's reversal.
*   **Evidentiary Weight of Emails:** The CA dismissed Ascutia's email as self-serving, but the SC gives it weight in conjunction with JUPP's admission. This highlights a potential evidentiary challenge.
*   **Lack of Written Agreement:** The absence of a written agreement specifying the terms of the car plan and commission structure exposes JUPP to greater liability.
*   **Unilateral Deduction:** the unilateral deduction of car participation and amortization payment to Asentista's sales commission, to the latter's prejudice.
*   **Locsin Ruling:** Any benefit or privilege enjoyed by Asentista from using the service vehicle was merely incidental and insignificant, because for the most part the vehicle was under the respondents' control and supervision.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Section 97(f):** Defines "wage" to include commissions.
*   **New Civil Code, Article 22:** Addresses unjust enrichment.

**Outcome:**

The SC granted Asentista's petition, reversed the CA, and reinstated the NLRC's decision.  JUPP is ordered to pay the unpaid commissions, attorney's fees, and legal interest.
