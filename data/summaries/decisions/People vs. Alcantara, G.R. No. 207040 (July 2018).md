## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Alcantara y Li, et al.* G.R. No. 207040

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the People of the Philippines, assailing the CA Decision which affirmed the RTC Order dismissing the Information against respondents for violation of RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003). The alleged trafficking occurred at Pharaoh KTV. The RTC dismissed the case for lack of probable cause, finding no evidence of vulnerability of alleged victims for recruitment into prostitution or pornography, nor evidence of actual sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, nor proper marking of the money used in the alleged entrapment. The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, reversing the CA decision, and remanded the case to the RTC for further proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charges:** Violation of Section 4(a) and (e), in relation to Section 6(c) of RA 9208 (Qualified Trafficking in Persons).
*   **Issue 1:** Whether the RTC Judge can determine the existence of probable cause. *Ruling:* YES.  Cites Rule 112, Section 6(a) of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure and *Maza v. Turla* (G.R. No. 187094). Judge has the power to evaluate the prosecutor's resolution and supporting evidence to determine probable cause for issuing a warrant of arrest.
*   **Issue 2:** Whether the RTC Judge was correct in dismissing the case for lack of probable cause. *Ruling:* NO. The SC differentiated between the executive (prosecutor) and judicial (judge) determination of probable cause, citing *Mendoza v. People* (733 Phil. 603 (2014)). The RTC judge cannot act as an appellate court to review the prosecutor's determination, which is an executive function. This function can only be appealed with the Secretary of Justice.
*   **Rationale for Reversal:** The RTC judge erred in substituting its judgment for the prosecutor's and dismissing the case based on evidentiary matters that should be determined during trial (citing *People v. Borje, Jr.* 749 Phil. 719).  The reasons cited by the judge (lack of actual intercourse, no marked money) are matters of defense best addressed during trial. The prosecutorâ€™s findings of probable cause should not be lightly interfered with unless there is grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Accused):** Subject to criminal prosecution if probable cause is established in subsequent proceedings.
*   **RTC:** Obligated to proceed with the case, considering the SC's determination that probable cause exists based on the prosecutor's findings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal on Appeal (Hypothetical):** If the RTC eventually convicts the respondents, the respondents could appeal based on insufficiency of evidence or other legal errors during trial.
*   **Acquittal (Hypothetical):** If the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the respondents will be acquitted.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary contention revolves around the degree of deference a trial court should give to the prosecutor's finding of probable cause. The SC emphasizes non-interference unless there is a grave abuse of discretion, but the line between proper judicial scrutiny and improper interference may be subject to further interpretation.
