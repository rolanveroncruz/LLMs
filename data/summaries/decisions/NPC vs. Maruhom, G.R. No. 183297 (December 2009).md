**Case Summary: *National Power Corporation v. Omar G. Maruhom, et al.*, G.R. No. 183297 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that affirmed the RTC's Order granting a writ of execution in favor of respondents.

**Facts:** NPC constructed underground tunnels under land owned by respondents without their consent in 1978.  Respondents discovered this in 1992 and filed suit in 1994 for recovery of possession and damages. The RTC initially ruled in favor of respondents, ordering NPC to pay fair market value for the land used (effectively just compensation), rentals, moral damages, and attorney's fees. This was appealed, modified, and ultimately, after a petition for relief from judgment, the CA reinstated the original decision but deleted moral damages and reduced rentals and attorney's fees. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. NPC then contested the subsequent writ of execution arguing that payment of just compensation should entitle it to title to the land.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court denied NPC's petition, affirming the CA's decision and upholding the writ of execution.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Just Compensation:** NPC is obligated to pay respondents the fair market value of the 70,000 sq. meter land (less 21,995 sq. meters), rentals from 1978, and attorney's fees. Specific amounts are as amended by the CA decision affirmed by the Supreme Court and as indicated within the text.
*   **Easement vs. Ownership:** The Supreme Court ruled that NPC's taking constituted an expropriation, even though it involved an easement and not full transfer of title. The permanent nature of the easement and the restrictions it imposed on the landowners' use justified the payment of full compensation.
*   **Writ of Execution:** The Court emphasized that a writ of execution must conform to the dispositive portion of the judgment. The RTC and CA's actions in granting the motion for execution and issuing the writ were valid as they aligned with the final decision. There was no order for the transfer of title within the initial ruling.

**Liabilities:**

*   NPC is liable for the monetary awards outlined in the final decision.
*   NPC is potentially exposed to future claims if it attempts to exceed the scope of the easement or otherwise interfere with the respondents' remaining property rights.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **No Title Transfer:** NPC does *not* receive title to the land despite paying full compensation. This leaves respondents with title, although severely restricted in their use.
*   **Continued Ownership:** The landowner could still exercise proprietary rights so long as they are not in conflict with the NPC's easement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Eminent Domain/Expropriation:** The Court confirmed that taking property by easement falls within the power of eminent domain (expropriation). The Court cited *Republic v. PLDT* to establish that an expropriation may impose a burden on the owner of condemned property without loss of title and possession
*   **Just Compensation:** Defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken, measured by the owner's loss, not the taker's gain. The Court cites *National Power Corporation v. Vda. de Capin*
*   ***Camarines Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*:** Supports awarding just compensation equal to fair market value even when only an easement is sought.
*   **G.R. No. 168732:** This Supreme Court decision affirmed the CA decision.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Easement:** While the judgment does not explicitly define the precise permissible activities within the easement, future disputes could arise if the respondents attempt uses that NPC deems incompatible with its tunnels.
*   **Continuing Obligations:** The finality of the decision doesn't preclude potential future litigation concerning the ongoing impact of the easement on the respondents' property or any changes in circumstances.
* **Unjust Enrichment** NPC claims that the current ruling allows unjust enrichment of the plaintiffs, but the Court holds that there is no basis for such a claim.

**Conclusion:**

The decision definitively settles the immediate issue of compensation for the taking of subterranean area by NPC and upholds the writ of execution. However, the lack of a clear definition of the easement's scope and the absence of a title transfer leave open the possibility of future disputes regarding the land's use and the extent of NPC's rights.
