## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Health Insurance Corporation vs. Commission on Audit*

**Case:** *Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) vs. Commission on Audit (COA), Michael G. Aguinaldo, Chairperson*, G.R. No. 249061, May 21, 2024.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64, assailing COA Decision No. 2017-422 and Resolution dated September 24, 2018.

**Subject Matter:** Disallowance of benefits and allowances totaling PHP 4,146,213.85 granted to job order and project-based contractors of PhilHealth Regional Office No. V (ROV) from 2009-2011. The disallowed benefits include transportation allowance, sustenance gift, nominal gift, productivity enhancement incentive, special events gift, project completion incentive, efficiency gift, alleviation gift, labor management relations gift, gratuity gift, and contractors gift.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed the payments citing lack of legal basis, absence of Office of the President (OP) approval for transportation allowance, and violation of Civil Service Commission (CSC) rules prohibiting benefits to job order/contractual employees.
*   **Liability:** COA initially held approving and certifying officers solidarily liable for the disallowances. The COA CP modified the ruling in that payees need not refund the disallowed benefits received.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7875 (National Health Insurance Act of 1995):** PhilHealth argued fiscal autonomy under this Act allowed them to fix compensation of personnel. The Court rejected this argument citing previous rulings.
*   **RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law):** The Court reiterates that Philhealth is bound by the provisions of the Salary Standardization Law
*   **PD 1597:** This decree requires Presidential approval for certain allowances and benefits.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, Series of 1998 (Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions):** This memorandum excludes job order employees from government employee benefits.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 021480:** Reiterated the exclusion of job order employees from benefits enjoyed by government employees.
*   **Madera v. COA, 882 Phil. 744 (2020):** Laid down rules on the return of disallowed amounts. This case is heavily relied upon by the court in determining the liabilities of the approving and certifying officers.
*   **PhilHealth v. COA (numerous cases):** The Court has consistently addressed PhilHealth's claims of fiscal autonomy, clarifying its limits.
*   **Development Bank of the Philippines v. COA, G.R. No. 262193, July 11, 2023** - Presidential approval of a compensation and benefits scheme that is unauthorized by law will not stop the State from correcting the erroneous application of a statute.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Job Order/Project-Based Contractors (Payees):**  The COA CP absolved the payees from refunding the benefits.
*   **Approving Officers:** Initially solidarily liable, but Court limits liability to the "net disallowed amount" after amounts were excused from being returned by the payees. Because there is nothing more for the approving officers to return, the assailed NDs must be modified. The facts indicate that the approving and certifying officers were not among the recipients of these disallowed benefits.
*   **Certifying Officers:** The Court held that the certifying officers were not solidarily liable because they merely certified the availability of funds and the completeness of supporting documents, without showing any bad faith.
*   **Members of PhilHealth's Board of Directors:** COA CP directed the audit team leader and supervising auditor to issue a supplemental ND to include them as persons liable, the PHIC Board of Directors, who issued and approved the Board Resolutions granting the disallowed benefits and allowances.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Fiscal Autonomy" Misinterpretation:** PhilHealth's continued reliance on a broad interpretation of its fiscal autonomy despite established jurisprudence creates a risk of future similar disallowances.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** The approving officers' actions, even without malice, were considered "gross negligence" due to disregard for established rules and case law.
*   **Future Disallowances:** The pending request for post facto approval from the OP does not validate illegal payments to non-employees, meaning that similar benefits will be prone to disallowances in the future.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court partly granted the petition, affirming the disallowances but modifying the liability of the officers involved. The case emphasizes the limits of PhilHealth's fiscal autonomy and the importance of adhering to existing rules and regulations concerning government expenditures, specifically regarding non-employees. The court found that the certifying officers cannot be held solidarily liable for the amounts, while the approving officers shall no longer refund the net disallowed amount.
