Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court resolution, focusing on key aspects for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines, et al. v. Hon. Jaime Delos Angeles, et al.* (G.R. Nos. L-26112 & L-30240; 588 Phil. 1003)

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution on a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the execution of a 46-year-old CFI decision in Civil Case No. 373 (an annulment of titles proceeding).

**Key Provisions & Holding:**

*   **Core Issue:**  The main issue is the proper execution of the 1962 CFI decision annulling Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-9550 (and other derivative titles) issued to Ayala y Cia and/or Hacienda Calatagan and reverting illegally included areas (portions of the territorial waters and lands of public domain) back to the public domain.

*   **Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIES Ayala y Cia's Motion for Reconsideration and reiterates its prior directives (Resolutions of November 16, 2006, and April 15, 2008) to immediately execute the CFI decision.  This denial is explicitly declared as **FINAL**, barring further pleadings under pain of contempt.

*   **Invalidation of Lower Court Orders:** The Resolution explicitly invalidates the orders issued by Judge Makalintal as *ultra vires*, stating they attempted to limit, vary, or re-adjudicate the CFI decision. The Court ruled that the determination of satisfaction of judgment rests on the Court because the decision being implemented has effectively been the Court's.

*   **Relocation Survey:**  The Court affirmed the order for a relocation survey (now directed by Judge Austria) as a tool to prevent errors in execution, **not** as a basis for re-litigating settled issues.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Ayala y Cia:** Obligated to fully comply with the CFI decision and Supreme Court directives regarding the annulment of titles and reversion of lands.  Continued obstruction will result in contempt.
*   **Judge Maria Cecilia I. Austria:** Obligated to proceed with the immediate execution of the CFI decision, including directing the relocation survey and ensuring the cancellation of affected titles. Obligated to provide quarterly progress reports to the SC.
*   **Register of Deeds of Batangas:** Obligated to cancel affected titles as directed by the Court and implement the reversion of lands to the public domain.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 48:** Ayala's argument regarding the annulment of titles only being effected in a direct proceeding under this law was rejected, as the Court deemed the initial case sufficient.
*   **Rule 39, Section 6 of the Revised Rules of Court**: Discusses execution by motion or by independent action.
*   **Dizon v. Rodriguez (G.R. No. L-20300-01):** Referenced to show the inclusion of inalienable lands of the public domain by Ayala.
*   **Republic v. Ayala y Cia (G.R. No. L-20950):** The original case affirming the CFI decision with modification.
*   **Republic v. Delos Angeles (G.R. No. L-30420):** Discussed the history of the case and the attempts to execute the decision.
*   **Shioji v. Harvey (G.R. No. 18940):** Lower courts are bound by the decree.
*   **Doctrines invoked:**
    *   Res Adjudicata
    *   Law of the Case
    *   Finality of Judgment

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of "Other Subdivision Titles":**  While the Court states the descriptions are "sufficient," determining *all* the derivative titles and properties affected by the original TCT No. 722's illegal expansion could be a complex and contentious task, potentially requiring significant legal and technical expertise.  This is where the relocation survey is critical.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Ayala's persistent obstruction suggests continued resistance. Vigilant monitoring and strict enforcement of contempt powers will be necessary.
*   **Third-Party Rights:** The Resolution acknowledges the involvement of third parties (purchasers of subdivided lots).  The execution process must carefully address any legitimate rights acquired in good faith and for value *after* the CFI decision became final, within the framework of property law principles.  This might necessitate ancillary proceedings to resolve conflicting claims.

**Contention:**
*   **Dizon v. Rodriguez (G.R. No. L-20300-01)** Contention: The illegally absorbed lots were converted into fishponds and sold to third parties.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that the CFI decision *must* be executed. The primary risk is continued delay and obstruction by Ayala, requiring diligent action by the relevant authorities to overcome resistance. The relocation survey is key to defining the properties to be reverted, and the execution must be handled carefully to address any potential impacts on third parties while upholding the integrity of the final judgment.
