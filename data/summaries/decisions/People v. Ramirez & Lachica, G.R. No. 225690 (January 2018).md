## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ramirez and Lachica*, G.R. No. 225690

**Nature:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the conviction of Belinda Galienba Lachica and Gerald Arvin Elinto Ramirez for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   The case revolves around a buy-bust operation conducted by PDEA agents that resulted in the arrest of Lachica and Ramirez.
*   The charges were for selling 8.4228 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).

**Key Issues & Holdings:**

*   **Chain of Custody Breakdown:** The Court found a significant break in the chain of custody, primarily due to the failure of the poseur-buyer (IO1 Bautista) to immediately mark the seized drugs at the place of arrest. The marking was instead done approximately one hour later at the PDEA office in Quezon City, creating a gap where tampering could have occurred.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21, R.A. 9165:** The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (pre-amendment by R.A. 10640) which requires immediate inventory and photographing of the seized drugs at the place of arrest in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official. While an elected public official (Barangay Kagawad) was present during inventory, the lack of media and DOJ representatives, in conjunction with the chain of custody issues, contributed to the reversal.
*   **Rejection of "Presumption of Regularity":** The Court rejected the lower courts' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, stating that this presumption cannot substitute for compliance with Section 21 and cannot overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence. The lapses in procedure are affirmative proofs of irregularity, not regularity.
*   **Failure to Establish Corpus Delicti:** Due to the significant breaks in the chain of custody and the non-compliance with Section 21, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the existence of the corpus delicti (the dangerous drug itself) beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Acquittal:** The Court acquitted Lachica and Ramirez, ordering their immediate release.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 21 (prior to amendment by R.A. 10640):**  Outlines the procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, including the mandatory inventory and photographing requirements.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165, Section 21(a), Article II:** Further details the procedures for inventory and photographing, including the "saving clause" for justifiable non-compliance.
*   *People v. Beran*, 724 Phil. 788 (2014):  Distinguishes inventory procedures based on whether the seizure was conducted with a warrant or warrantless (e.g., buy-bust).
*   *People v. Sanchez*, 590 Phil. 214 (2008):  Emphasizes the importance of immediate marking of seized items at the place of confiscation.
*   Other cases cited emphasize the importance of chain of custody and the presumption of innocence (see footnotes in original document).

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case highlights the importance of meticulous adherence to the procedural requirements of R.A. 9165 to ensure convictions in drug-related cases.
*   The failure to immediately mark seized drugs and to conduct the required inventory and photographing in the presence of the prescribed witnesses significantly increases the risk of acquittal.
*   This ruling reinforces the principle that the "presumption of regularity" cannot be used to excuse non-compliance with mandatory procedures.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in the IRR of R.A. 9165 has often been a point of contention. This case emphasizes that the prosecution must convincingly demonstrate justifiable grounds for non-compliance and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. The Court clearly found the excuse (IO1 Bautista claiming the area was unsafe for marking) offered by the prosecution here unconvincing, given the number of PDEA agents present.
