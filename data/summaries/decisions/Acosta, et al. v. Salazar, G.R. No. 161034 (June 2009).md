## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 161034

**Case Name:** *Zenaida Acosta, et al. vs. Trinidad Salazar, et al.*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** June 30, 2009

**Nature of Document:** Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals decision that reversed a Regional Trial Court decision dismissing a complaint for quieting of title.

**Key Issue:** Validity of RTC orders cancelling entries on a Torrens title based on an *ex parte* petition and the subsequent action for quieting of title.

**Facts:**

*   Salazars (Respondents) filed an *ex parte* petition (LRC Land Case No. L-2829) to cancel entries on OCT No. 40287, registered in the name of Juan Soriano and Vicenta Macaraeg. They allege that the entries are void.
*   RTC Branch 63 initially granted the petition and ordered the cancellation of Entry No. 20102 and later ordered the recall of all titles issued under Entry Nos. 19756 and 20102 and to cancel all the tax declarations issued based thereon
*   Petitioners (Acosta, et al.), subsequent purchasers of portions of the land, filed a comment opposing the cancellation, asserting good faith and value.
*   RTC Branch 63 withdrew all incidents in the case without prejudice.
*   Salazars then filed a complaint for quieting of title (Civil Case No. 7256) against Petitioners in RTC Branch 64.
*   RTC Branch 64 dismissed the quieting of title complaint, finding that Salazars failed to prove they were heirs of Juan Soriano and deemed TCT No. 219121 issued in Salazars' names as null and void.
*   The CA reversed the RTC Branch 64 decision, holding that it was erroneous for Branch 64 to reverse Branch 63. The CA reasoned the orders issued by Branch 63, had become final and executory, hence, covered by res judicata.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Indispensable Parties:** The Court held that the petition for cancellation of entries was quasi in rem and should have impleaded the heirs of Juan Soriano and their successors-in-interest as indispensable parties. Failure to implead indispensable parties renders the RTC Branch 63 orders invalid and not binding on the Petitioners. *[B.E. San Diego, Inc. v. Alzul]*
*   **Validity of *Ex Parte* Proceedings:** The Court ruled that the *ex parte* petition for cancellation of entries was inappropriate. Impugning a Torrens title requires a *direct* action filed in court, not an *ex parte* petition.
*   **Collateral Attack:** The SC declared the *ex parte* petition of Salazars as a collateral attack. *[Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529]*
*   **Laches/Prescription:** The Salazars' failure to assert their claim for over 30 years, coupled with the transfer of property to Petitioners who secured their own TCTs, leads to the conclusion that their claim has either prescribed under *[Article 1141 of the Civil Code]* or is barred by laches.

**Obligations:**

*   **Salazars:**  Had an obligation to properly implead indispensable parties in the initial petition for cancellation of entries.  Failed to diligently pursue their claim within a reasonable timeframe.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Salazars:**  Risked losing any claim to the property due to prescription/laches and failure to follow proper legal procedure.
*   **Petitioners:** Potential risk of title uncertainty if the initial proceedings were deemed valid. This risk is mitigated by the SC's ruling in their favor.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 48:** Prohibits collateral attack on certificates of title.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1141:**  Prescribes a 30-year period for real actions over immovables.
*   ***B.E. San Diego, Inc. v. Alzul, G.R. No. 169501, June 8, 2007, 524 SCRA 402, 432.*** : Rules on Indispensable Parties

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The validity of the original TCT No. 9297 in the names of the heirs of Juan Soriano is not fully adjudicated, but impliedly upheld by the SC's decision.
*   The potential claim, if any, of the Salazar's is also not adjudicated.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and reinstated the RTC decision dismissing the complaint for quieting of title. The Court focused on the failure of the Salazars to implead indispensable parties in their initial *ex parte* petition for cancellation of entries, making the orders of RTC Branch 63 void. The Court further ruled the *ex parte* petition as a collateral attack, thus invalid. The Court also implied that Salazars' claim, if any, had prescribed or was barred by laches. The ruling strengthens the stability of the Torrens system and provides clarity on the required procedure for challenging land titles.
