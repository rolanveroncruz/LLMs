## Legal Document Summary: *Villanueva v. Chiong*, G.R. No. 159889 (2008)

**Subject:** Annulment of Sale of Conjugal Property

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Walter and Aurora Villanueva (Buyers)
*   **Respondents:** Florentino and Elisera Chiong (Sellers/Spouses)

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sale of Property:** Florentino Chiong sold a portion of Lot No. 997-D-1 to the Villanuevas in 1985 without the consent of his wife, Elisera Chiong. A Deed of Absolute Sale was executed in 1992.
*   **Property Status:** The land was acquired during the marriage of Florentino and Elisera, thus presumed conjugal property under Article 160 of the Civil Code.  Respondents executed a Memorandum of Agreement declaring that lot to be conjugal.
*   **Elisera's Claim:** Elisera Chiong filed suit to quiet title, claiming the sale was void due to lack of her consent.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC annulled the sale and ordered the Villanuevas to vacate the property, but ordered Florentino to return the purchase price with interest.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Florentino Chiong:** Obligated to return the purchase price (P8,000) to the Villanuevas. The SC deleted obligation to pay interest.
*   **Walter and Aurora Villanueva:** Obligated to vacate the property and remove improvements.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Spousal Consent:** The primary legal issue is the lack of Elisera's consent to the sale. Under Articles 166 and 173 of the Civil Code, the sale of conjugal property without the wife's consent is *voidable*, not void ab initio, during the marriage and within ten years.  Elisera timely filed suit within the ten-year period to question the sale.
*   **Property Improvements:** The Villanuevas bear the risk of losing improvements made on the property.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 160, 166, 173, 178, 1398:** Relevant provisions regarding conjugal property, the requirement of spousal consent for alienation of conjugal property, the remedies available to the wife in case of alienation without consent, effects of legal separation on conjugal property, and the effects of the annulment of a contract.
*   **Family Code:** Although not directly applicable (transaction occurred before its effectivity), its principles regarding marital property regimes are relevant for background.
*   ***Vda. de Ramones v. Agbayani*, G.R. No. 137808 (2005) and *Villaranda v. Villaranda*, G. R. No. 153447 (2004):**  Cited for the principle that alienation or encumbrance of conjugal property by the husband without the wife's consent *before* the Family Code is voidable, not void.
*   ***Heirs of Ignacia Aguilar-Reyes v. Mijares*, G.R. No. 143826 (2003) citing *Bucoy v. Paulino*, 131 Phil. 790 (1968):** Cited on the complete annulment of the sale by husband without wife's consent.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Separation:** Petitioners' argument that the factual separation resulted in actual liquidation of the conjugal property is rejected by the Court, affirming that judicial approval is required for dissolution of conjugal partnership.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the annulment of the sale. Given the lack of Elisera's consent, the sale was validly annulled by the RTC. The Villanuevas must vacate the property, and Florentino must return the purchase price.
