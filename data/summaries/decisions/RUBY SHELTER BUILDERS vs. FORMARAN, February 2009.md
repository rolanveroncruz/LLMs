## Legal Document Summary: Ruby Shelter Builders and Realty Development Corporation v. Hon. Pablo C. Formaran III, et al. (G.R. No. 175914, February 10, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the proper assessment of docket fees.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the action filed by Ruby Shelter Builders (Petitioner) against Romeo Tan, Roberto Obiedo, and Atty. Reyes (Respondents) for the declaration of nullity of deeds of sale and damages is a real action requiring docket fees based on the property's fair market value (Section 7(a), Rule 141) or an action incapable of pecuniary estimation (Section 7(b)(1), Rule 141).

**Background:**

*   Petitioner obtained a loan from Respondents Tan and Obiedo, secured by real estate mortgages.
*   A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was executed, extending the loan's due date and including *dacion en pago* (Deeds of Absolute Sale) as security. The deeds were to take effect if the loan wasn't paid by a specific date.
*   The MOA stipulated liquidated damages and assumption of monetary obligation by petitioner president, Mr. Sia, in case of contest.
*   When the debt was not paid, Respondents presented the pre-executed Deeds of Absolute Sale and obtained TCTs in their names.
*   Petitioner filed a complaint alleging *pactum commisorium*, falsified acknowledgment, and seeking to annul the deeds, claiming willingness to pay the debt. It sought injunctions, damages and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MOA and Deeds of Absolute Sale:** The core of the dispute revolves around the validity of the MOA and Deeds of Absolute Sale. Specifically, whether it constitutes an invalid *pactum commisorium* (agreement allowing a creditor to appropriate the mortgaged property upon default).
*   **Dacion en Pago:** The MOA stipulates a *dacion en pago*. The success of the dation rests on if the properties had been transferred to the creditor. The MOA was registered to the TCTs so the parties were able to change ownership.
*   **Docket Fees:** The primary obligation is the payment of correct docket fees.  The decision hinges on the categorization of the action to determine which section of Rule 141 applies.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** The MOA imposes liquidated damages of P10,000,000.00 on the petitioner should they contest the MOA or Deed of Absolute Sale.
*   **Personal Guarantee:** Mr. Sia, as president, personally guaranteed the monetary obligation, potentially exposing him to personal liability.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:**
    *   **Financial:** Potentially liable for the loan amount plus interest, penalties (if *pactum commisorium* is deemed invalid), liquidated damages, and the significant additional docket fees.
    *   **Property Loss:** Potential loss of the real properties subject to the Deeds of Absolute Sale.
*   **Respondents:**
    *   **Risk of Pactum Commissorium:** Potential invalidation of the *dacion en pago* if the court deems it an unenforceable *pactum commissorium*. They also risk having to return the properties.
*   **Atty. Reyes:** Subject to claims of connivance and falsification of acknowledgment in the Deeds of Absolute Sale. This could lead to administrative or criminal liability.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Pactum Commissorium:** The core risk revolves around the *pactum commisorium* argument.  If the court finds the MOA an unenforceable *pactum commissorium*, the Deeds of Absolute Sale would be invalidated, potentially forcing the respondents to accept payment and return the properties, while incurring losses from penalties, and surcharges being condoned.
*   **Falsified Acknowledgement:** The allegation of falsified acknowledgement raises credibility issues regarding the execution of the Deeds.
*   **Forcible Takeover:** The allegation of forcible takeover and demolition could expose the Respondents Tan and Obiedo to claims of damages and potentially criminal liability.
*   **Ambiguity in MOA:** The discrepancy in the amount of condoned interests and penalties within the MOA (P55,167,000.00 vs. P74,678,647.00) could create further dispute.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC):** This rule governs legal fees and is central to the dispute. Specifically, the proper application of Section 7(a) vs. Section 7(b)(1).
*   **Civil Code (Pactum Commissorium):** While not explicitly cited, the legal principle of *pactum commissorium* is the basis for the petitioner's claim of nullity.
*   ***Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals*:**  Established that the court acquires jurisdiction upon payment of prescribed docket fees.
*   ***Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion*:** Laid down guidelines for the implementation of the *Manchester* ruling.
*   ***Spouses De Leon v. Court of Appeals*:** Petitioner's main authority; however, the court distinguished it because the action involved only annulment, not recovery of property.
*   ***Gochan v. Gochan*, *Siapno v. Manalo*, *Serrano v. Delica*:** Cited to support the court's finding that the action is a real action when it ultimately seeks to recover title to and possession of property, even if disguised as an action for annulment.

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **DENIED** the Petition for Review. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the RTC's Orders requiring the petitioner to pay additional docket fees based on Section 7(a), Rule 141, because the action, regardless of its title, is ultimately a real action seeking the recovery of title and possession of real property. The Court also said that financial capability of petitioner to pay for additional fees.
