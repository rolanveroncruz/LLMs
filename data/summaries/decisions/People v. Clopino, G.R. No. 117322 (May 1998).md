## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Clopino*, G.R. No. 117322 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This is a rape case appeal where the accused-appellant, ULYSIS CLOPINO, was found guilty by the trial court and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction with a modification to the damages awarded.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Incident:** On February 16, 1992, the accused-appellant allegedly dragged Melody Quintal (16-year-old student) into a forest and forcibly had carnal knowledge of her.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:**
    *   Victim's testimony: Accused confronted her, asked her to kiss him and proceeded to drag her and force her to undress and lie down. He tried to penetrate her vagina.
    *   Corroborating Witnesses: Victim’s sister and cousin witness accused pushing them down a ravine and running in the direction of the victim.
    *   Medical Examination: Dr. Tanael's findings of fresh hymenal lacerations, vaginal discharge, erythema at the epigastric area, and abrasions on the neck corroborated the victim's account of force and penetration. While the test for spermatozoa was negative, the doctor stated that that may be because the vaginal discharge was not sufficient to test for spermatozoa,
*   **Defense Evidence:** Accused claimed consensual sexual acts, denying force and penetration and denied pushing the victim’s companions.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The trial court found the accused guilty based on the prosecution's evidence and the victim's credible testimony.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused is liable for civil indemnity of P50,000.00 to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense argued inconsistencies between the victim's sworn statement, complaint and testimony regarding the extent of penetration. The Supreme Court resolved this by emphasizing that even slight penetration constitutes rape, citing *People v. Castromero, G.R. No. 118992, Oct. 9, 1997*. The court found that the victim clearly stated there was contact.
*   **Credibility Assessment by Different Judge:** The defense challenged the credibility assessment made by a judge who didn't try the case. The Supreme Court stated that a judge can assess credibility from the records, citing cases where they had to evaluate the witness's testimony based on the transcripts of notes from the case.
*   **Spermatozoa Absence:** While no spermatozoa was found, the Court reaffirmed that the absence of spermatozoa doesn't negate rape, citing *People v. Solomon, 229 SCRA 403 (1993)*, due to potential factors like quantity of discharge.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (rape provision - likely Art. 266-A, although not explicitly stated).
*   Civil Code, Art. 2217 (regarding moral damages - damages were awarded as civil indemnity due to lack of sufficient proof required by the law.)
*   Revised Rules on Evidence, Rule 132, §13 (Impeachment of witness through prior inconsistent statement).

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Castromero* (slightest touching constitutes rape).
*   *People v. Compedio, Jr.* (assessment of credibility by a different judge).
*   *People v. Tuvilla* (validity of decision by a judge not present during the trial).
*   *People v. Solomon* (absence of spermatozoa doesn't negate rape).
*   *People v. Molina, 53 SCRA 495 (1973)* (courts are inclined to lend credence to testimony of young and immature offended parties).
*   *People v. Gementiza* (civil indemnity as proper award, not moral damages).
