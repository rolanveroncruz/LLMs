Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown.

**Case:** *Rommel Genio y Santos vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 261666, January 24, 2024)

**Subject Matter:**  Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a conviction for Bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Supreme Court ultimately overturns the CA ruling, finding the petitioner not guilty of bigamy on the ground of reasonable doubt but convicts him for violation of Article 350 of the RPC, knowingly contracting a marriage against the provisions of laws.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Bigamy Charge (Art. 349, RPC):** Rommel Genio y Santos was charged with bigamy for contracting a second marriage to Maricar Santos Galapon while still legally married to Magdalena Esler Genio.
*   **Prosecution's Evidence:** The prosecution presented the Marriage Certificate between Rommel and Maricar, issued by the PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority), as proof of the second marriage, invoking the presumption that a public document is prima facie evidence of its contents (Art. 410, Civil Code). They also presented testimony from the first wife.
*   **Defense's Argument:** Rommel argued that the second marriage was void ab initio because it was not solemnized by a duly authorized officer (the Municipal Mayor) and lacked a proper marriage ceremony, thus failing to meet the essential requisites for validity as outlined in Article 3 of the Family Code, a requirement for the crime of bigamy. They presented testimony from the second wife and her relatives to corroborate their claim.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction, upholding the presumption of regularity of the Marriage Certificate and finding the defense's evidence insufficient to overcome it.  The CA cited *Santiago v. People* (764 Phil. 128 (2015)), stating that Rommel should be estopped from denying the validity of the marriage due to his own misrepresentation.

**Supreme Court's Holding and Rationale:**

*   **Overturned Bigamy Conviction:** The Supreme Court granted the petition in part, reversing the CA's decision finding Rommel guilty of bigamy. The SC ruled that the prosecution failed to prove the fourth element of bigamy (valid second marriage) beyond a reasonable doubt.

*   **Evidentiary Presumption and Burden of Proof:**
    *   The Court extensively discussed the use of evidentiary presumptions in criminal cases, referencing Section 6, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 19-08-15-SC), which states that if a presumed fact establishes guilt or an element of the offense, the existence of the basic fact must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the presumed fact must follow from the basic fact beyond a reasonable doubt.
    *   The Court emphasized that the *existence* and *authenticity* of the Marriage Certificate were proven (basic fact), but the *truth of the contents*, regarding proper solemnization, was disputed.
    *   The Court reiterated *Pulido v. People*, stating that an accused can raise the defense of a void ab initio second marriage even without a judicial declaration of nullity.
    *   The Court found that Rommel *did* present substantial evidence rebutting the presumed regularity of the Marriage Certificate. The testimonies of the second wife and her relatives created reasonable doubt regarding the validity of the solemnization. The court noted that only “some evidence,” not "clear and convincing evidence," is required for the accused to rebut an evidentiary presumption.
    *   The Supreme Court stated, "All doubts on the sufficiency of the accused's evidence to rebut an evidentiary presumption must be resolved in favor of the accused." It emphasized that substantial evidence is the minimum threshold required for a rebuttal, meaning the defense evidence needs to be "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."
    * Once the accused has rebutted the presumption of guilt, it shifts the burden back to the prosecution to prove it again beyond a reasonable doubt.

*   **Distinction from *Santiago v. People*:**  The Court distinguished the present case from *Santiago v. People*. The SC clarified that Rommel can not be convicted of bigamy because the prosecution failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all the elements of the felony. Estoppel, a principle of equity, can not be applied in positive provisions of the Family Code on the essential and formal requisites of a valid marriage.

*   **Conviction for Violation of Article 350 of the RPC:**
    *   Despite overturning the bigamy conviction, the Court found Rommel GUILTY of violating Article 350 of the RPC. Knowingly contracting a marriage against provisions of the laws is a crime against the civil status of persons.
    *   Referencing Sections 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, the Court held that a conviction for a lesser included offense is permissible.
    *   The elements of Article 350 were met: Rommel contracted a marriage with Maricar, knowing that the legal requirements were not met (specifically, he was still married and never dissolved), and he was not among the persons who are included in Article 349 of the RPC due to his prior marriage.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case clarifies the application of evidentiary presumptions in criminal cases and emphasizes the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The SC explained its standard for reasonable doubt in *People v. Ballesteros*.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision clarifies that while a Marriage Certificate is prima facie evidence of its contents, this presumption can be rebutted with substantial evidence, particularly when the validity of the marriage itself is at issue. The Court's reliance on the revised Rules of Evidence underscores the importance of proving each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. However, contracting a marriage against provisions of the laws may still result in criminal liability under Article 350 of the RPC.
