**Case Summary: Tapuz v. Del Rosario, G.R. No. 182484, June 17, 2008**

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution of the Supreme Court addressing a petition for certiorari and for the issuance of writs of amparo and habeas data.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Daniel Masangkay Tapuz, et al.
*   **Respondents:** Judge Elmo del Rosario, Sheriff Nelson dela Cruz, PNP Boracay, Court of Appeals, and Spouses Gregorio and Ma. Lourdes Sanson.

**Factual Background:**

The Sansons filed a forcible entry and damages case against the Tapuzes in the MCTC based on alleged prior possession of a parcel of land (TCT No. 35813). MCTC ruled in favor of the Sansons. The RTC affirmed and issued a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and demolition. The Tapuzes appealed to the CA, then filed the instant petition with the Supreme Court. Petitioners allege prior possession, Sansons' intrusion, acts of violence, and lack of MCTC jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Certiorari Petition:** Dismissed as filed out of time (beyond the 60-day reglementary period under Rule 65) and for forum shopping. The SC noted a pending CA petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 02859) addressing the same RTC orders. Defective Verification and certification of non-forum shopping due to one petitioner failing to sign.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The MCTC had jurisdiction over the forcible entry case because the complaint alleged forcible entry, not a claim involving title or possession exceeding P20,000. Cites Section 33 of The Judiciary Reorganization Act, as amended by RA 7691. Distinguishes between *accion interdictal* and *accion publiciana/reivindicatoria*.
*   **Writ of Amparo Petition:** Dismissed for failure to establish a *prima facie* case of imminent or continuing threat to the rights to life, liberty, or security. The issues are predominantly property-related. The Court found the allegations of violence linked to the property dispute, not to the personal safety of the petitioners. The Court highlighted the importance of the ongoing civil dispute and potential disruption of ongoing litigation. Failure to show that ordinary remedies were insufficient or deficient.
*   **Writ of Habeas Data Petition:** Dismissed for failure to allege facts demonstrating an unlawful violation of privacy related to life, liberty, or security. Lack of showing for the need to compel the PNP to release information beyond what was already submitted, appearing as a fishing expedition. Failed to demonstrate insufficiency of previous efforts made to secure information.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The Petitioners were obligated to adhere to the procedural rules governing certiorari (Rule 65) and disclose the pending CA appeal (avoid forum shopping).
*   Petitioners have potential liabilities for forum shopping (summary dismissal, direct contempt).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Sanctions for forum shopping (dismissal of pending CA appeal).
*   Continuing enforcement of the RTC writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and demolition if not overturned on appeal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Rules of Court (Rules 7, 46, 56, 65)
*   Rule on the Writ of Amparo (A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC)
*   Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data (A.M. No. 08-1-16-SC)
*   The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7691, Sections 19 and 33.
*   *Spouses Julita dela Cruz v. Pedro Joaquin, G.R. No. 162788, July 28, 2005, 464 SCRA 576* (forum shopping).
*   *Reyes v. Sta. Maria, No. L-33213, June 29, 1979, 91 SCRA 164.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The nature and severity of the threats to life and security needed to justify the issuance of a writ of amparo were contentious, with the Court finding the alleged threats predominantly property-related.
*   The precise scope of the "fishing expedition" principle in the context of habeas data and the need to specify the data required beyond what is already available were points of ambiguity.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds (certiorari, forum shopping) and for failure to demonstrate sufficient factual basis for the issuance of the writs of amparo and habeas data. The key risk is the potential for continued enforcement of the lower court's orders, as well as sanctions for forum shopping.
