**Legal Document Summary: *Citigroup Business Process Solutions Pte. Ltd. v. Raymundo B. Corpuz***

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 208738-39, June 05, 2024 (Supreme Court)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's Decision setting aside the NLRC's ruling, effectively declaring Corpuz's dismissal illegal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in upholding Corpuz's dismissal by Citigroup.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied Citigroup's petition, affirming the CA's decision with modification. The SC agreed that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion.

**Facts:**

*   Corpuz, a Customer Solutions Officer (CSO) for Citigroup, was terminated for disclosing customer information to a person he believed to be from MetLife, Citigroup's insurance provider. The disclosed information included name, address, account number, and mortgage account status.
*   Citigroup alleged violation of Privacy Promise Agreement and Confidential Information Agreement, constituting serious misconduct, willful disobedience, and breach of trust.
*   Corpuz argued he believed the caller was from MetLife and acted in good faith, considering it intra-office correspondence.
*   LA initially dismissed Corpuz's complaint. NLRC affirmed dismissal but awarded nominal damages for procedural due process violations (insufficiently specific show cause memo). CA reversed, ruling illegal dismissal based on lack of serious misconduct.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Just Cause for Termination (Art. 297 Labor Code, formerly Art. 282):** The SC focused on whether Corpuz's actions constituted "serious misconduct" or "loss of trust and confidence."
    *   **Serious Misconduct:**  Referenced *Sterling Paper Products Enterprises, Inc. v. KMM-Katipunan* (815 Phil. 425, 435 (2017)) stating that serious misconduct requires a willful act or wrongful intent. The SC determined the CA correctly found no such intent, as Corpuz believed he was assisting a Citigroup affiliate.
    *   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** While the ruling recognizes this as a possible ground for termination, the act that resulted in the alleged loss of trust and confidence must be real, founded on clearly established facts, and willful.
*   **Due Process:** While the NLRC originally found procedural flaws, the CA and SC focused primarily on the substantive issue of whether there was just cause for termination.
*   **Backwages and Reinstatement:**  Generally, illegally dismissed employees are entitled to both. However, reinstatement was deemed infeasible due to strained relations. *Claudia's Kitchen, Inc. v. Tanguin* (811 Phil. 784 (2017)) was cited concerning when separation pay is appropriate in lieu of reinstatement.
*   **Separation Pay:** Awarded in lieu of reinstatement, calculated as one month's salary for every year of service (from hiring to finality of the decision).
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded at 10% of the total monetary awards due to Corpuz because he was forced to litigate.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Citigroup:** Liable for backwages (from illegal dismissal to finality of the SC decision), separation pay, and attorney's fees.
*   **Corpuz:** Obligated to accept separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Calculation of Awards:** Requires precise calculation of backwages and separation pay based on salary history and years of service. Disputes regarding these calculations could arise.
*   **Definition of "Finality":** The exact date of "finality" needs to be determined to accurately calculate the backwages and separation pay due.

**Conclusion:**

The SC decision is unfavorable to Citigroup. The company is liable for significant monetary awards to Corpuz. The decision underscores the requirement of "willful intent" for serious misconduct and the importance of justifiable cause when terminating an employee for loss of trust and confidence. Citigroup should promptly calculate the monetary awards owed and engage with Corpuz to resolve the matter to avoid further legal action.
