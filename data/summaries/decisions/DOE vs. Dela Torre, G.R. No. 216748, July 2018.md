**Legal Document Summary: *Department of Education v. Nixon Q. Dela Torre, et al.*, G.R. No. 216748, July 25, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's ruling that Respondent Nixon Dela Torre has a better right to possess a parcel of land covered by OCT No. 0-841.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Donation (1979):** Maria Pencerga donated a 4-hectare portion of the subject land to Poblacion Cabanglasan Elementary School.
*   **Sale (1988):** Maria Pencerga sold a 100,024 square meter lot (including the donated portion) to Nixon Dela Torre.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Nixon has a better right to possess the land. Cabanglasan Elementary School is ordered to vacate and reconvey possession, or alternatively, Nixon must either reimburse the school for improvements or sell the land to the school. Nixon is also directed to deliver a portion of the land to his co-plaintiffs.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Department of Education (Petitioner):**
    *   **Risk:** Loss of possession of the land occupied by the Cabanglasan Elementary School.
    *   **Liability:** Potential obligation to vacate the premises or negotiate a purchase or reimbursement agreement with Nixon Dela Torre.
*   **Nixon Dela Torre (Respondent):**
    *   **Obligation:** To deliver a portion of the land to co-plaintiffs based on prior sales agreements.
    *   **Risk:** Potential difficulties in coordinating with or enforcing obligations against co-plaintiffs.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Viaje, 779 Phil. 405 (2016):**  Reiterates the OSG's role as principal counsel even with deputized counsel, entitling the OSG to all court notices.
*   **Cervantes v. City Service Corp., 784 Phil. 694 (2016):**  Reiterates service of orders must be made to counsel of record.
*   **Rep. of the Phils. v. Court of Appeals, 781 Phil. 15 (2016):** Any court order to a deputy of the Solicitor General is not binding until actually received by the Solicitor General.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 34:** Evidence not formally offered cannot be considered by the court.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Waiver of Right to Present Evidence:** The main contention revolves around whether the Department of Education, represented by both the OSG and the deputized City Prosecutor, was properly notified and whether its right to present evidence was validly waived. The OSG argues lack of proper representation due to lack of notice of court proceedings, which violates due process. The Court rejected this argument, finding the OSG was notified of the prosecutor's inaction and failed to act diligently.
*   **Conflicting claims of ownership:** The donation to the school versus the later sale to Nixon raises questions about the validity and enforceability of each transaction, which may be affected by the presence of the prior donation. This is further complicated by the fact that a portion of the land was subsequently sold to co-plaintiffs.
*   **Remedies:** The RTC ruling provides alternative remedies (vacate/reimburse improvements/sell land) which could be contentious in their implementation and valuation.

**Potential Risks & Legal Strategy:**

*   The Supreme Court has already affirmed the CA and RTC decisions, making the case res judicata. There's very little chance of success in further appeals.
*   The petitioner's strongest argument was procedural due process regarding notification. However, the courts rejected this argument.
*   The best course of action for the Department of Education is likely to focus on negotiating a favorable settlement with Nixon Dela Torre regarding either reimbursement for improvements or purchase of the land, as dictated by the RTC's alternative remedies. This negotiation should factor in the prior donation and any relevant laws governing government property and expropriation.
