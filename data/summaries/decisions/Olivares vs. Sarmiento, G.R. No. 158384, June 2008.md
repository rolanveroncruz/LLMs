**Case Summary: Olivares vs. Sarmiento, G.R. No. 158384 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which reversed the trial court's ruling, effectively declaring several deeds of sale as null and void, and ordering the restoration of possession to the respondent.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale between Respondent Sarmiento and Boteros, and consequently, the subsequent sale to Petitioners Olivares and Robles.

**Facts (Brief):**

*   Respondent owned land mortgaged to DBP. Respondent allegedly obtained a loan from Boteros (neighbor) to prevent foreclosure.
*   Boteros allegedly paid off the DBP loan.
*   Respondent and Boteros executed a Deed of Definite Sale and later a Deed of Absolute Sale for the property.
*   Boteros sold the property to Petitioners, who obtained a clean title.
*   Respondent filed suit claiming forgery and seeking recovery of ownership, annulment of title, and damages.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Boteros and Petitioners.
*   CA reversed, finding the transaction was an equitable mortgage.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reinstated the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Deed of Definite Sale (May 1979):** Alleged sale of the property to Boteros for P2,000 plus assumption of the DBP loan.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (July 2, 1979):** Sale of property to Boteros for P25,000.
*   **Deed of Definite Sale (January 7, 1984):** Boteros sale of the property to petitioners.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent's alleged obligation:** Payment of mortgage to DBP.
*   **Boteros' alleged obligation:** Payoff of the DBP loan.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent (Initially):** Failure to pay the DBP loan, leading to foreclosure risk.
*   **Respondent (Potentially):** If CA ruling stood, to reimburse petitioners the DBP payoff amount plus legal interest.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Alleged Forgery:** Respondent claimed forgery of the deeds, which could invalidate the sales. However the NBI report proved otherwise.
*   **Equitable Mortgage vs. Absolute Sale:** CA ruled equitable mortgage based on Article 1602 of the Civil Code (inadequate price, vendor remaining in possession).  Supreme Court overturned this, finding lack of evidence for price inadequacy and that continued possession was merely tolerated.
*   **Good Faith of Petitioners:** CA argued petitioners weren't good faith buyers due to awareness of respondent's continued possession, implying duty to inquire.  The SC didn't rule on this, making its ruling on the sale decisive.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1332, Civil Code:** Duty to explain contract terms to a party unable to read or understand the language.  Cited by CA, but seemingly unpersuasive to the SC.
*   **Article 1370, Civil Code:** Literal interpretation of clear contract terms. Relied on by the SC.
*   **Article 1602, Civil Code:** Presumption of equitable mortgage in specific circumstances (inadequate price, etc.).  Central to CA's decision, rejected by the SC.
*   **Article 1604, Civil Code:** Applies Article 1602 to contracts purporting to be absolute sales.
*   **Rule 45, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Basis for the Petition for Review.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Ceballos v. Intestate Estate of the late Emigdio Mercado, G.R. No. 155856, 28 May 2004, 430 SCRA 323:** Presumption of regularity for notarized documents.
*   **Heirs of the Late Spouses Aurelio and Esperanza Balite v. Lim, G.R. No. 152168, 10 December 2004, 446 SCRA 56; Tuazon v. Court of Appeals, 396 Phil. 32 (2000):** Contract is the law between parties and when the words of the contract are clear and can be easily understood, there is no room for construction.
*   **Lumayag v. Heirs of Jacinto Neme√±o, G.R. No. 162112, 3 July 2007, 526 SCRA 315; Roberts v. Papio, G.R. No. 166714, 9 February 2007, 515 SCRA 346:** Definition of an equitable mortgage.
*   **Raymundo v. Bandong, G.R. No. 171250, 4 July 2007, 526 SCRA 514; Roberts v. Papio, G.R. No. 166714, 9 February 2007, 515 SCRA 346:** Contract of sale considered an equitable mortgage when real intention of the parties was to secure an existing debt by way of mortgage.
*   **San Pedro v. Lee, G.R. No. 156522, 28 May 2004, 430 SCRA 338:** Mere inadequacy of price is not sufficient to prove it as an equitable mortgage.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Consideration for the Deed of Absolute Sale:** Was it a fair price, or so inadequate as to suggest an equitable mortgage?
*   **Respondent's Continued Possession:** Was it tolerated or did it indicate something other than an absolute sale?

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court prioritized the legal presumption of valid notarized documents and clear contract terms. It required stronger evidence than mere allegations and subjective arguments to overcome these presumptions and overturn the RTC's original decision. This case highlights the importance of proper documentation and clear intentions in real estate transactions.
