## Legal Document Summary: *SSgt. Edgardo L. Osorio v. Assistant State Prosecutor Juan Pedro C. Navera et al.*

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Habeas Corpus) assailing CA Resolutions denying SSgt. Osorio's petition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7055, Sec. 1:** Civil courts have jurisdiction over crimes under the Revised Penal Code committed by AFP members, *unless* the offense is "service-connected" (defined as Articles 54-70, 72-92, 95-97 of the Articles of War). In service-connected cases, Courts-Martial have jurisdiction.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 267:** Defines kidnapping and serious illegal detention, typically applicable to "private individuals."
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 102, Sec. 1:** Defines the scope of habeas corpus as a remedy for illegal confinement.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 102, Sec. 4:** Habeas corpus is *not* allowed if the person is held under a valid court process and the court had jurisdiction.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 117, Sec. 3:** Lists grounds for a Motion to Quash.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **SSgt. Osorio's Obligations:** To face trial in civil court for kidnapping charges. He also had the option to file a Motion to Quash before arraignment.
*   **State's Obligations:** To ensure SSgt. Osorio receives due process in his trial.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction:** SSgt. Osorio faces potential conviction for kidnapping and serious illegal detention if found guilty, facing *reclusion perpetua* to death.
*   **Procedural Issues:** The denial of habeas corpus hinges on the validity of the arrest warrant and the civil court's jurisdiction. Challenges to the preliminary investigation (due process) must be raised through proper channels (Motion to Quash).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Santiano (359 Phil. 928 (1998)) & People v. PO1 Trestiza (676 Phil. 420 (2011)):** Establish precedent that public officers can be charged with kidnapping if acting in a private capacity, outside their official duties.
*   **In re Saliba v. Warden (757 Phil. 630 (2015)):** Example where habeas corpus was granted due to mistaken identity, emphasizing the importance of protecting liberty.
*   **General Habeas Corpus Jurisprudence:** Establishes that habeas corpus cannot be used to circumvent standard trial procedure or to act as a substitute for appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Private Individual" in Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code:** SSgt. Osorio argued that as a soldier, he couldn't be charged under this article. The Court rejected this, citing *Santiano* and *Trestiza*, stating that illegal detention is not within the scope of a soldier's duties.
*   **"Service-Connected" Offense under RA 7055:** SSgt. Osorio argued that the kidnapping was service-connected, therefore Courts-Martial should have jurisdiction. The Court held that kidnapping is not a function of a soldier.

**Statutory References:**

*   RA 7055
*   Revised Penal Code Art. 267
*   Commonwealth Act No. 408 (Articles of War)

**Conclusion:**

The Court upheld the denial of habeas corpus. The Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction as the offense (kidnapping) is under the Revised Penal Code, is not "service-connected," and Osorio was deemed to be acting in a private capacity. SSgt. Osorio's remedy is to pursue normal trial proceedings, including filing a Motion to Quash based on permissible grounds under Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.
