**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 159755**

**Case:** *Grace Gosiengfiao Guillen, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.*

**Subject Matter:** Timeliness of exercising the right of legal redemption by co-heirs after a prior Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 101522) affirmed their right to redeem.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Right of Legal Redemption:** The central issue is whether the petitioner-heirs validly exercised their right of legal redemption over a co-owned property sold to the respondent-buyers. This right stems from Article 1620 of the Civil Code.
*   **Written Notice Requirement (Art. 1623, Civil Code):** The 30-day period to exercise the right of legal redemption begins *only* upon **written notice** of the sale by the *vendor* (seller), *not* from any other source (e.g., knowledge, court decision).
*   **Mariano Decision (G.R. No. 101522):** This prior SC decision affirmed the heirs' right to redeem, noting the absence of proper written notice, thus the redemption period never began. The present case is essentially an attempt to execute that prior judgment. This establishes the **law of the case.**
*   **Sheriff's Certificate of Redemption:** The key document reflecting the petitioners' exercise of redemption, issued after the respondent-buyers refused the tender of payment.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondent-Buyers:** At risk of losing ownership of the property if the redemption is deemed valid. The lower courts' decisions favored them, arguing the redemption was untimely.
*   **Petitioner-Heirs:** Initially risked losing their right to redeem if the court had upheld the respondent-buyers' argument that the finality of the Mariano decision constituted sufficient notice of sale.
*   **Statute of Limitations (Implied Argument):** While not explicitly stated, the respondent-buyers' arguments hinted at a potential defense based on the statute of limitations, arguing the right to redeem was lost due to the passage of time.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1620, Civil Code:** Right of redemption for co-owners.
*   **Article 1623, Civil Code:** Defines the critical requirement of written notice by the vendor to trigger the redemption period.
*   **G.R. No. 101522 (Mariano v. CA):** The prior SC decision that is the basis of the current dispute. Law of the case doctrine applies.
*   **Conejero v. Court of Appeals (16 SCRA 775):** Cited by the buyers, this case established the principle that the giving of a copy of a deed is equivalent to notice as required by law in legal redemption. However, the SC clarifies that the facts in the Conejero case are not the same as in the current case.
*   **Butte v. Manuel Uy & Sons, Inc.:** The text of Article 1623 clearly and expressly prescribes that the thirty days for making the redemption are to be counted from notice in writing by the vendor.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Written Notice":** The respondent-buyers argued that the Supreme Court's decision in G.R. No. 101522, upon its finality, served as sufficient written notice. The core dispute revolves around whether this constitutes proper notice under Article 1623. The SC rejected this argument.
*   **Timeliness of Execution:** While the right to redeem was established in the prior decision, the respondent-buyers argued that the delay in seeking execution (filing notice of redemption) was unreasonable and resulted in waiver.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the petitioner-heirs' exercise of their right of redemption was valid and timely. The court reaffirmed that the 30-day period for redemption begins to run *only* upon written notice of the sale *from the vendor*, as required by Article 1623 of the Civil Code. The finality of the prior Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 101522) did *not* constitute such notice. The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the law of the case established in the prior decision.
