## Legal Document Summary - *Diwa Asia Publishing, Inc. v. De Leon* (G.R. No. 203587)

**Type:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA's decision reversing the NLRC and reinstating its prior ruling of illegal constructive dismissal.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Diwa Asia Publishing, Inc. (Diwa) and Saturnino Belen (Chairman of Diwa's Board)
*   **Respondent:** Mary Grace U. De Leon (former HR Manager)

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The central issue is whether De Leon was constructively dismissed by Diwa.  The Court, affirming the CA, finds that she was.  The test is whether a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to resign. *McMer Corporation, Inc., et al. v. NLRC, et al., 735 Phil. 204, 213 (2014)*
*   **"Hostile Work Environment":** Key evidence supporting constructive dismissal includes a pattern of fault-finding, nitpicking, and disdain from FAVCI Executive Director Asuncion (de facto supervisor despite formal reporting structure), documented in e-mail correspondence.  The court highlights petitioners' selective presentation of email threads.
*   **Demotion/Diminution of Responsibilities:** De Leon's exclusion from important HR decisions, being relegated to clerical tasks, and the assignment of her responsibilities to another employee (Dulig) while still formally holding the position of HR Manager constitute a demotion amounting to constructive dismissal. *Norkis Trading Co., Inc. and/or Albos, Jr. v. Gnilo, 568 Phil. 256, 268 (2008)*
*   **Lusterio's Affidavit:** The affidavit of a former employee corroborated the hostile environment claim, detailing specific instances of mistreatment by Asuncion. The court gave weight to this testimony.
*   **Laptop Incident:** The court accepts De Leon's version of the laptop-shoving incident, finding petitioners' denial unsubstantiated.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Diwa is liable for full backwages (from June 23, 2004, until the finality of the decision) inclusive of allowances and other benefits, and separation pay (one month's salary for every year of service) in lieu of reinstatement due to strained relations.  Both backwages and separation pay will earn legal interest.
*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:**  Petitioners failed to adequately prove that their conduct was justified. *Meatworld International, Inc. v. Dominique A. Hechanova, G.R. No. 208053, October 18, 2017*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 279:** Specifies remedies for unjust dismissal.
*   ***McMer Corporation, Inc., et al. v. NLRC, et al., 735 Phil. 204, 213 (2014):*** Definition of Constructive Dismissal
*   ***Norkis Trading Co., Inc. and/or Albos, Jr. v. Gnilo, 568 Phil. 256, 268 (2008):*** Definition of Constructive Dismissal when an employee's functions were reduced
*   ***Meatworld International, Inc. v. Dominique A. Hechanova, G.R. No. 208053, October 18, 2017:*** The employer is charged with the burden of proving that its conduct and actions were for valid and legitimate grounds

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Quantification of Backwages & Separation Pay:** The exact monetary amount owed will depend on De Leon's final salary and years of service, requiring precise calculation to include allowances and other benefits. The court ruled that backwages shall be paid with interest at twelve percent (12%) per annum from June 23, 2004 to June 30, 2013 and at six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until their full satisfaction, and her separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, shall earn interest at six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's ruling, finding that De Leon was constructively dismissed due to a hostile work environment and a diminution of her responsibilities.  Diwa is liable for backwages and separation pay with interest. The key takeaway is the importance of documenting and addressing hostile work environments within HR management, given the weight the court places on the email communications and corroborating testimony. There are no further avenues for appeal given this is a decision from the Supreme Court. Diwa and Belen must fulfill the monetary obligations as stated in the decision.
