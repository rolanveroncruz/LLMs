# Legal Document Summary: People v. Sisracon, et al. G.R. No. 226494, February 14, 2018

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming with modification the CA decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC decision finding the accused-appellants guilty of multiple counts of Qualified Rape.

**Parties:**

*   **Plaintiff-Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Accused-Appellants:** Jomar Sisracon y Rupisan, Mark Valderama y Rupisan, Roberto Cortez y Badilla, Luis Padua y Mitra, and Adonis Motil y Golondrina

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for nine (9) counts of Qualified Rape under Article 266-A and Article 266-B, par. 1, in relation to Article 266-B, 2nd par. of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8353 and Section 5 of R.A. 8369.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 266-A, RPC:** Defines Rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, intimidation, or when deprived of reason or unconscious.
*   **Article 266-B, RPC:** Establishes Reclusion Perpetua as the penalty for Rape and Reclusion Perpetua to Death when committed with a deadly weapon or by two or more persons.
*   **R.A. 8353:** Amends the Revised Penal Code to include rape as a heinous crime.
*   **R.A. 8369:** Further amends the Revised Penal Code on the crime of rape.
*   **R.A. 9344:** The Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006. Section 38 mandates automatic suspension of sentence for offenders under 18, even if they reach 18 by the time of judgment. Section 51 allows for confinement in agricultural camps in lieu of penal institutions.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court Modified the decision of the lower courts and found the accused guilty of two counts of rape, modifying the penalties of imprisonment for some appellants as a few of the accused were below the age of 18 at the time of the commission of the crime.
*   Civil Indemnity: P100,000.00 per count of Rape
*   Moral Damages: P100,000.00 per count of Rape
*   Exemplary Damages: P100,000.00 per count of Rape

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness (AAA):** The core of the defense rested on challenging AAA's credibility.
*   **Identification of Perpetrators:** AAA's identification of Jomar by voice was crucial. The lack of identification of the other perpetrators was cited in modifying the amount of counts of rape.
*   **Proof of Conspiracy:** The court inferred conspiracy from the collective actions of the accused before, during, and after the rape. The court cited previous cases to demonstrate conspiracy can be inferred.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The RTC appreciated nighttime as an aggravating circumstance. The Supreme Court found that although the act was done at nighttime, the prosecution did not prove the commission was done under cover of the night.
*   **Application of R.A. 9344:** Although the RTC and CA did not automatically suspend the minor appellants sentence in view of RA 9344, the Supreme Court held that the minor appellants at the time the crime was committed should be entitled to a suspended sentence, that is, the minor offenders must be confined in an agricultural camp.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Aaron, 438 Phil. 296, 309 (2002):** Elements of Rape.
*   **People v. Malana, 646 Phil. 290, 302 (2010):** Credibility of witnesses in rape cases.
*   **People v. Evangelio, 672 Phil. 229, 246 (2011):** Conspiracy in criminal law.
*   **People v. Jacinto** and **People v. Sarcia:** Application of R.A. No. 9344 beyond the age of 21.
*   **People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016:** Proper award of damages in crimes where death penalty is imposable but not carried out.
*   **Article 8, RPC:** Definition of Conspiracy.
*   **Article 68 (2), RPC:** Defines the parameters for the application of penalties for offenders between 15 and 18 years old.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of the number of rapes committed and whether all accused were active participants remains contentious, as evidenced by the Supreme Court modifying the findings from the lower courts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but with modified penalties due to the age of certain defendants. The issue of sentencing was also remanded to the lower court with instruction to implement Section 51 of R.A 9344.
