**Case:** *Forbes Park Association, Inc. vs. PAGREL, Inc., et al.* (G.R. No. 153821, February 13, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of the Petitioner Forbes Park Association Inc's CA Petition for Annulment of Final Order of the RTC.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in finding *litis pendentia* and/or forum shopping in FPA's Petition for Annulment of Final Order seeking to reinstate deed restrictions that the RTC had cancelled.

**Background:**
*   **Deed Restrictions:** Forbes Park had deed restrictions annotated on property titles, including a 50-year term from January 1, 1949, renewable by 2/3 vote of the FPA membership (Clause III).
*   **Extension Attempts:** FPA attempted to extend these restrictions. Validity of the extension was challenged in HIGC cases.
*   **PAGREL Cases:** PAGREL, Inc., Pilar R. De Lagdameo, and Enrique B. Lagdameo filed separate *ex parte* petitions (LRC Case Nos. M-4150, M-4151, and M-4152) with the Makati RTC to cancel the restrictions on their respective titles, arguing expiration. FPA was not made a party.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC granted the *ex parte* petitions, ordering the cancellation of the restrictions.
*   **CA Petition for Annulment:** FPA filed a Petition for Annulment of the Final Order with prayer for TRO and Writ of Injunction (CA-G.R. SP No. 67263) alleging extrinsic fraud due to non-joinder.
*   **Lis Pendens Case:** FPA separately pursued annotating *lis pendens* on titles related to the HIGC cases concerning the validity of the extension. This was denied by the Register of Deeds, appealed to the LRA, and then to the CA (CA-G.R. SP No. 61245, later G.R. No. 148733).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, finding no *litis pendentia*.

**Reasoning:**
*   **No Identity of Parties:** While FPA was the Petitioner in both the Lis Pendens case and the PAGREL cases, the Respondents were different. The Lis Pendens case involved the Register of Deeds, while the Pagrel Cases had PAGREL, Inc., De Lagdameo, and Lagdameo, with the RTC Judge as public respondent.
*   **No Identity of Causes of Action:** The Lis Pendens case concerned the legality of annotating a notice of lis pendens, while the CA petition for Annulment concerns the fraudulent RTC order cancelling the original annotations of the Deeds of Restriction.
*   **No Identity of Reliefs Prayed For:** The reliefs sought were distinctly different in the two cases.
*   **Removal of Obstacle:** *G.R. No. 148733 (Lis Pendens Case)* was dismissed, removing any potential for *litis pendentia*.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**
*   **Deed Restrictions:** The core issue is the validity and enforceability of the deed restrictions. Clause I requires membership in FPA; Clause II subjects lots to FPA regulations; Clause III deals with the 50-year term and extension mechanism.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud:** FPA alleges PAGREL, Inc., et al. committed extrinsic fraud by failing to implead FPA in the *ex parte* proceedings to cancel the restrictions.
*   **Litis Pendentia:** The CA decision hinged on this doctrine, which the SC ultimately rejected.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Validity of Extension:** Although the initial CA decision upholding the extension of the Deed of Restrictions and the Association's Corporate life was withdrawn, the Supreme Court stated that the withdrawal of the appeal in the Rocha case did not mean the issue was fully resolved.
*   **Ex Parte Proceedings:** Validity of the RTC's ex parte cancellation of the restrictions is central to the Petition for Annulment.
*   **Interpretation of Deed Restrictions:** The specific language of the deed restrictions may be subject to interpretation, particularly regarding the validity of amendments and extensions.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Basis for the Petition for Review to the Supreme Court.
*   **Litis Pendentia:** Case law cited *Bauan v. Lopez*, *Sherwill Development Corporation v. Sitio Sto. Ni√±o Residents Association, Inc.*, *Tirona v. Alejo*, and *Tourist Duty Free Shops, Inc. v. Sandiganbayan* defines the doctrine.
*   **Arturo V. Rocha v. Forbes Park Association, Inc.:** (HIGC Case No. HOA-97-003), the Rocha case, and its associated appeals, are central to the history and context.

**Next Steps:**
*   The case is remanded to the CA, which must proceed with the Petition for Annulment of Final Order in CA-G.R. SP No. 67263.
*   The CA must determine whether the *ex parte* proceedings in the RTC were improper and if PAGREL, Inc., et al. committed extrinsic fraud by not impleading FPA.
*   The ultimate determination of the CA will depend on the validity of the Deed of Restrictions and the extent of the enforcement power to the FPA.

This summary highlights the crucial elements of the case and identifies potential areas of concern for legal analysis and strategy.
