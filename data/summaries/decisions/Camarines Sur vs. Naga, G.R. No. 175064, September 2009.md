## Legal Document Summary - *Province of Camarines Sur v. City of Naga* (G.R. No. 175064)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court on a Petition for Certiorari involving a dispute over administrative control and supervision of Plaza Rizal.

**Background:** The case originated from a Complaint for Declaratory Relief and/or Quieting of Title filed by the City of Naga against the Province of Camarines Sur concerning Plaza Rizal, a parcel of land within Naga City. The Province claimed ownership and administrative control, while the City sought a declaration vesting administrative control in the City, given its location within Naga's territorial jurisdiction. The RTC ruled in favor of the City, and the Court of Appeals initially dismissed the Province's Petition due to procedural issues and a lack of grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **City of Naga's Argument:** Section 2, Article I of R.A. No. 305 (City of Naga Charter) defines the territorial jurisdiction of the City and implicitly grants administrative control over properties within it, including Plaza Rizal. The City asserts administrative control should vest with it, irrespective of ownership, due to its territorial jurisdiction.

*   **Province of Camarines Sur's Argument:** The Province asserted ownership and the right to manage Plaza Rizal and that RA 305 only defines the boundary of the City of Naga and does not vest a color of right over its properties within the City's jurisdiction. There was no actual controversy for a declaratory relief action, and the City lacked any legal or equitable interest for a quieting of title action.

*   **Supreme Court's Holding:**
    *   **Procedural Error:** The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeals erred by treating the Province's Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) as a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65).
    *   **Declaratory Relief:** The Court upheld the City's resort to declaratory relief as proper, as it sought the construction of a statute (RA 305) and had a justiciable controversy with a legal interest, ripe for judicial determination.
    *   **Nature of Plaza Rizal:** The Court classified Plaza Rizal as property for public use (a public park or promenade) under both the Spanish Civil Code and the 1950 Civil Code (Art. 424), thereby preventing the claim of ownership by either Naga City or Camarines Sur. Such properties cannot be privately owned ( In the Matter of Reversion/Recall of Reconstituted Act No. 0-116 Decree No. 388, Heirs of Palaganas v. Registry of Deeds, Tarlac City, G.R. No. 171304, 10 October 2007, 535 SCRA 476, 484).
    *   **Administrative Control:** Citing *Municipality of San Carlos, Pangasinan v. Morfe*, the Court held that prior to Naga becoming a City, the province rightly administered Plaza Rizal on behalf of the Republic. However, upon Naga becoming a City by virtue of RA 305, Plaza Rizal, being within its territory, should be under the City's administrative control and supervision.
    *   **Tax Declaration:** The tax declaration in the name of the Province was deemed insufficient to prove ownership, as it's merely an indicia of a claim of ownership (*Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 73246*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 305 (Charter of the City of Naga) - particularly Section 2, Article I.
*   R.A. No. 1336 (Transfer of Provincial Capitol).
*   Spanish Civil Code of 1889 (Art. 344).
*   Civil Code of 1950 (Art. 424).
*  *Municipality of San Carlos, Pangasinan v. Morfe* - Ruling on public plaza administration.
*  *Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 73246* - Ruling on tax declarations as indicators of ownership.

**Obligations:** The City of Naga is obligated to administer and supervise Plaza Rizal as property for public use within its territorial jurisdiction.

**Liabilities:** The Province of Camarines Sur is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Claims of Ownership:** Although the Court did not rule on the issue of who owns Plaza Rizal, the ruling that it is for public use, implies it cannot be claimed by either the Province of Camarines Sur or the City of Naga.
*   **Boundary Disputes:** While not explicit in this decision, potential future disputes could arise if there's a lack of clarity regarding the exact boundaries between the Province and City, potentially impacting other properties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Sec. 2, Art. I of RA 305:** While the Court clarified its meaning, future disputes may arise if Naga City uses this to claim ownership.
*   **Administrative Control vs. Ownership:** The decision focuses on administrative control, distinct from ownership. This distinction could lead to future legal challenges if one party attempts to assert rights beyond mere administration.
