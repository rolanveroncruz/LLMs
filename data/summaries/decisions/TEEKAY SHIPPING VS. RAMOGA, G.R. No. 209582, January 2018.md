**Legal Document Summary: Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc. vs. Roberto M. Ramoga, Jr. (G.R. No. 209582)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming the NLRC's award of permanent total disability benefits to a seafarer.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Standard POEA contract with 8-month duration, basic monthly salary of $264.21 as Deck Trainee, with Teekay Shipping Ltd. as the employer and Teekay Shipping Philippines Inc. as the local manning agency.
*   **Injury:** Seafarer suffered a fractured ankle (non-displaced fracture base of 2nd and mild displaced fracture base of 3rd metatarsal bone) due to a slip and fall on board the vessel.
*   **Medical Assessment:** Company-designated physician initially treated the seafarer and eventually declared him fit to return to work 186 days after repatriation. The seafarer consulted his own doctor, who declared him permanently unfit for sea duties.
*   **Disability Claim:** Seafarer filed a claim for permanent total disability benefits, sickness allowance, medical expenses, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The core issue is whether the petitioners (Teekay Shipping) are liable for permanent total disability benefits under the POEA contract and relevant labor laws. The outcome hinges on the validity and timeliness of the company-designated physician's fitness assessment.

**Court's Ruling (SC):**

*   Petition granted; CA decision reversed and set aside; seafarer's complaint dismissed.
*   The SC emphasized the significance of the company-designated physician's assessment and the timelines for issuing such assessment based on existing jurisprudence.
*   The Court found sufficient justification for extending the initial 120-day period for assessment because the company doctor advised the seafarer to continue rehabilitation and medications.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of Medical Assessment:** The core dispute revolves around whether the company-designated physician's "fit to work" declaration was timely and sufficient under the applicable rules. The CA initially found the assessment lacking definitiveness.
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** Discrepancy between the company-designated physician's assessment and the seafarer's own doctor's assessment. The SC typically favors the company-designated physician's assessment.
*   **Interpretation of "Permanent Total Disability":** The case hinges on the interpretation of what constitutes a "permanent total disability" under Article 198(c)(1) of the Labor Code and Section 2, Rule X of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, especially regarding the 120/240-day rule.
*   The seafarer's premature filing of the case on March 4, 2011, was a significant factor, as the company-designated physician still had time to make a declaration until June 1, 2011.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 198(c)(1):** Definition of total and permanent disability.
*   **Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, Section 2, Rule X:** Period of entitlement and conditions for temporary total disability.
*   **Revised Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-going Vessels (POEA Contract).**
*   **Elburg Shipmanagement Phils. Inc., et. al. v. Quiogue, 765 Phil. 341 (2015):** Harmonization of the 120/240 day rules.
*   **Jebsens Maritime, Inc., Sea Chefs Ltd., and Enrique M Aboitiz v. Florvin G. Rapiz, G.R. No. 218871, January 11, 2017:** Guidelines on seafarer's claim for permanent total disability benefits.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   The decision highlights the importance of the company-designated physician providing a well-documented and justified extension beyond the initial 120-day period for medical assessment.
*   Challenging the credibility or thoroughness of the company-designated physician's assessment is crucial, but often difficult given the deference courts tend to give to these assessments.
*   Prompt filing of claims may be detrimental to the seafarer if filed prior to the lapse of the company-designated physicianâ€™s extended assessment period.
