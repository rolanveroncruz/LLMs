## Legal Document Summary: People v. Molejon, G.R. No. 208091 (April 23, 2018)

**Overview:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming with modification the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which in turn affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Benito Molejon for five counts of Qualified Rape (Art. 266-A, RPC as amended by RA 8353) and eleven counts of Acts of Lasciviousness/Lascivious Conduct (Art. 336, RPC and Sec. 5(b), RA 7610) against his stepdaughters AAA and BBB.

**Key Provisions and Charges:**

*   **Qualified Rape (5 counts):** Violations of Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by RA 8353.  Victims were Molejon's stepdaughters AAA and BBB. The offenses were qualified due to the victims being under 18, the offender being a stepparent, and the use of force, threat, and intimidation.
*   **Acts of Lasciviousness/Lascivious Conduct (11 counts):** Originally charged under Art. 336 of the RPC. The Supreme Court clarifies the charges as 3 counts of "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610" (victim BBB under 12 years of age), and 8 counts of "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610" (victim AAA over 12 but under 18 years of age).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Molejon is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all counts.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Qualified Rape:** Reclusion perpetua for each count, without eligibility for parole.
    *   **Acts of Lasciviousness (BBB):** Indeterminate sentence of 12 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL).
    *   **Lascivious Conduct (AAA):** Reclusion perpetua for each count, without eligibility for parole.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   **Qualified Rape:** P100,000 civil indemnity, P100,000 moral damages, and P100,000 exemplary damages per count to each victim.
    *   **Acts of Lasciviousness (BBB):** P15,000 fine, P20,000 civil indemnity, P15,000 moral damages, and P15,000 exemplary damages per count.
    *   **Lascivious Conduct (AAA):** P15,000 fine, P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages, and P75,000 exemplary damages per count.
    *   **Interest:** All monetary awards to earn 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Age Determination & Nomenclature:**  The Court corrected the lower courts' characterization and penalty calculations for the "Acts of Lasciviousness" crimes, distinguishing between instances where the victim was under 12 (covered by Art. 336 RPC in relation to RA 7610) versus 12 or older but under 18 (covered by RA 7610 alone). This distinction is important as it impacts the penalties applied.
*   **Application of Alternative Circumstance:** The court appreciated the alternative circumstance of the relationship given that the crimes were committed by the stepparent.
*   **Lack of Specific RA 7610 citation in the Information:** The Supreme Court held that the omission of specific section/s of R.A. 7610 in the information is not fatal, provided the body of the information contains an averment of the acts alleged to have been performed which unmistakably refers to acts punishable under Section 5 of R.A. 7610.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the credibility of the victims due to inconsistencies. The Court reiterated that minor inconsistencies in child victims' testimonies are often viewed as badges of truth.
*   **Alibi and Denial:**  The Court dismissed the accused's defenses of denial and alibi, finding them unsubstantiated and weak compared to the positive identification by the victims.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The primary contention revolved around properly characterizing the "Acts of Lasciviousness" crimes as either violations of Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, or simply "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610", depending on the victim's age. This distinction impacted the applicable penalties.
