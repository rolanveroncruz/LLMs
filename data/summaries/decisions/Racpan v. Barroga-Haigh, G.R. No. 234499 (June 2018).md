**Case:** *Rudy L. Racpan vs. Sharon Barroga-Haigh* (G.R. No. 234499, June 06, 2018)

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC's dismissal of Racpan's complaint for improper venue and failure to comply with barangay conciliation. Racpan filed a complaint for declaration of nullity of Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase before the RTC of Davao City, alleging his signature was falsified. The RTC dismissed, finding improper venue and failure to comply with barangay conciliation. The CA affirmed. The SC reverses the CA and RTC decisions.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase:** The core document in question. Its alleged falsification forms the basis of the complaint. Validity of the document is the ultimate issue.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 4, Sections 1 & 2 (Venue of Actions):** This rule distinguishes between real and personal actions, dictating where each type of action must be filed.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 412 (Barangay Conciliation):** Mandates barangay conciliation as a pre-condition to filing a case in court, except in specific instances.

**Liabilities:**

*   The primary liability concerns the validity of the Deed of Sale. If deemed valid, Racpan (or his estate) may be obligated under its terms (though the exact nature of this obligation isn't defined).
*   The respondent, Haigh, faces the risk of the Deed being declared null and void, thus losing any rights purportedly conferred by it.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Proof of Falsification:** Racpan bears the burden of proving that his signature was indeed falsified.
*   **Bona Fide Purchaser:** The court might consider if Haigh acted as a bona fide purchaser for value, affecting the ultimate outcome.
*   **Laches/Prescription:** Although not explicitly raised, these could become issues depending on when Racpan discovered the alleged falsification.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 4, Sections 1 & 2:** Defines real and personal actions and dictates venue.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 412:** Mandates barangay conciliation, with exceptions.
*   ***Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Hontanosas, Jr., 737 Phil. 38 (2014):***  Distinguishes between real and personal actions and their respective venues.
*   ***Chua v. Total Office Products and Services, Inc., 508 Phil. 490 (2005):***  Establishes that an action to annul a contract of loan and its accessory real estate mortgage is a personal action.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of the Action (Real vs. Personal):** The central point of contention. The SC found the action to be personal (annulment of contract), while the CA treated it as real (affecting title to property).
*   **"Good Faith" in applying for Preliminary Injunction:** The CA questioned the petitioner's motive in applying for a preliminary injunction, suggesting it was solely to circumvent barangay conciliation. The SC disagreed, asserting the presumption of good faith.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The SC emphasized that the nature of the action is determined by the allegations in the complaint and that the venue of a case is the primary objective for the filing of the case.
*   The SC considered the fact that Racpan's complaint sought the nullification of the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase, but did not allege the transfer of possession and title to the property to respondent. As such, nowhere in the Complaint did petitioner allege or pray for the recovery or reconveyance of the real property. Hence, it was a personal action.
*   Because Racpan's Complaint was coupled with a prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction, it falls among the exceptions to the rule requiring the referral to baranggay conciliation.
