**Case Summary: *Gatchalian v. Flores*, G.R. No. 225176 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which reversed the MeTC's ejectment ruling.

**Facts:** Petitioner (Gatchalian), a co-owner of Road Lot 23 (TCT No. 79180), filed an ejectment suit against Respondents (Flores et al.) for encroachment. Respondents argued that Road Lot 23 is a public road, "Don Juan Street Gat-Mendoza," due to Municipal Ordinance No. 88-04.  The MeTC ruled for Gatchalian, but the RTC reversed, dismissing the complaint. The CA initially reinstated the MeTC decision but then reversed itself upon reconsideration, affirming the RTC's dismissal.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Ejectment (Forcible Entry):** The central issue is physical possession of the subject property (Road Lot 23). Ownership is only relevant to determine possession.
*   **Nature of Road Lot 23:** Is it private property, subject to ejectment, or public property?
*   **Municipal Ordinance No. 88-04:** Did this ordinance convert the private road lot into a public road?
*   **Laches:** Did laches operate to convert the road lot to public property?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the MeTC's decision in favor of Gatchalian.

**Key Holdings and Rationale:**

1.  **Private Property Status:** Road Lot 23 remains private property. Registration under TCT No. 79180 in the name of Gatchalian's parents establishes private ownership.
2.  **Ordinance Insufficient for Conversion:** Municipal Ordinance No. 88-04 alone does not convert private property to public.  Expropriation proceedings (with just compensation) or donation by the owner are required. *Woodridge School, Inc. v. ARB Construction Co., Inc.* (545 Phil. 83 (2007)); *Republic v. Sps. Llamas* (G.R. No. 194190, January 25, 2017). The mere usage of the subdivision roads by the general public does not strip it of its private character.
3.  **No Laches:** Laches does not apply as long as the opposing claimant's possession was merely tolerated by the owner. A Torrens title holder does not lose rights to land due to laches where possession is merely tolerated. *Malonesio v. Jizmundo* (G.R. No. 199239, August 24, 2016).
4.  **Torrens Title Indefeasibility:** A Torrens title is indefeasible and can only be challenged in a direct proceeding. *Cagatao v. Almonte, et. al.* (719 Phil. 241, 253 (2013)). It grants the owner the right to possession, supporting the ejectment action.

**Obligations/Liabilities (per MeTC ruling reinstated):**

*   Respondents must vacate the 140.50 square meter portion of Road Lot 23.
*   Respondents must pay reasonable rental of P20,000/month plus legal interest from June 2, 2011, until full vacation of the encroached portion.
*   Respondents must pay P20,000 as attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   **Valuation of Rent:**  The "reasonable rental" amount (P20,000/month) might be subject to further challenge regarding its basis and justification.
*   **Definition of Encroachment:** The exact boundaries of the "140.50 square meter portion" and how this encroachment was proven may be a point of contention during enforcement.
*   **Enforcement:** Actual physical eviction and recovery of rental payments may require further legal action.

*   Torrens System
*   Local Government Code (implied regarding expropriation powers)
