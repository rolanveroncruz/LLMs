## Legal Document Summary: *Racines v. Morallos and Cabusao* (A.M. No. MTJ-08-1698)

**Nature:** Resolution finding Complainant Jaime Racines and his counsel, Atty. Onofre D. Manalad, guilty of indirect contempt for filing a baseless administrative case against Judge Morallos and Sheriff Cabusao.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Dismissal of Administrative Complaint:** The Court affirmed the OCA's recommendation to dismiss Racines's complaint against Judge Morallos and Sheriff Cabusao, holding that the proper recourse was appeal, not an administrative action.
*   **Contempt Finding:** Racines and Atty. Manalad were found guilty of indirect contempt for filing a baseless complaint.  This was based on Section 3, Rule 71 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically improper conduct tending to impede the administration of justice.
*   **A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC:** The Court cites this administrative matter, which addresses the proliferation of unfounded complaints against members of the judiciary, and gives them cause to hold the complainant in contempt.
*   **Racines's Defense Rejected:**  The Court rejected Racines's argument that he was misled by Atty. Manalad, invoking the presumption that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary act (Rule 131, Sec. 3(c)) and the presumption of an attorney's authority.
*   **Attorney's Responsibilities:** The Court emphasizes that a lawyer's duty to the court and the administration of justice takes precedence over loyalty to a client. Atty. Manalad, as an officer of the court, violated Canon 11 and Rule 11.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility by filing an unfounded administrative complaint and attributing improper motives to the judge unsupported by the record.

**Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Manalad:** Obligated to pay a fine of PHP 5,000.00.
*   **Racines:** Reprimanded.

**Liabilities:**

*   Both Racines and Atty. Manalad face potential further sanctions for repeating similar acts.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Disciplinary Action:** A repetition of similar conduct by either party could result in more severe penalties, including administrative sanctions against Atty. Manalad and further contempt charges against Racines.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Section 3, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Indirect Contempt)**
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(c), Rules of Court (Presumption of Intent)**

*   **Greater Metropolitan Manila Solid Waste Management Committee v. Jancom Environmental Corporation, G.R. No. 163663, (Presumption of Attorney authority)**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of Racines's understanding and volition in filing the initial complaint is arguably contentious, despite the Court's rejection of his defense. While the Court found he approved the filings by signing them and trusting the lawyer, he claimed he was deceived by his lawyer, which could be seen as an attempt to mitigate his culpability.
