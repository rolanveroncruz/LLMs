**Case:** *Simeon Nicolas Chan, et al. vs. Yolanda Chan, et al.* (G.R. No. 150746, October 15, 2008) - Intra-corporate Dispute concerning Ambassador Hotel, Inc.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order in an intra-corporate dispute. The core issue involves the validity of special board meetings, election of new officers, and the validity of certain shareholdings.

**Key Provisions & Events:**

*   **Dispute Origin:** A factional dispute within Ambassador Hotel, Inc. Petitioners (Chan group) challenge the validity of special board meetings called by Respondents (Chan/Rivera group) and subsequent resolutions passed therein. The Respondents sought to replace the petitioners as President and other positions due to alleged mismanagement.
*   **SEC Proceedings:** Petitioners initially filed a petition with the SEC to declare the special meetings as null and void. The SEC issued a TRO but denied the petition for a preliminary injunction.  A supplemental petition was filed challenging the validity of Respondent's shareholdings.
*   **Jurisdictional Shift:**  RA 8799 transferred jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes to the RTC (designated as special commercial courts). The case was transferred to RTC Manila, Branch 46.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC denied petitioners' motions (to deem conclusive the basis of shares, to declare Respondents in default, and to cite Respondents' counsel in contempt) and Respondents' motion for preliminary mandatory injunction.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari, holding that the RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Issues & Analysis:**

1.  **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Supreme Court (SC) addresses whether the Petitioners properly filed a Petition for Certiorari with the CA without first filing a Motion for Reconsideration with the RTC. The SC held that a Motion for Reconsideration was prohibited by the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies (Sec. 8, Rule 1), A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC which applied because of the intra-corporate nature of the controversy. *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ascot Holdings and Equities, Inc., G.R. No. 175163, October 19, 2007.*
2.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC reiterates the limited scope of certiorari, focusing on errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, not mere errors of judgment. *Deutsche Bank Manila v. Chua Yok See, G.R. No. 165606, February 6, 2006*.
3.  **Motion to Deem Conclusive Shares Entitled to Vote:** Petitioners sought a ruling determining which shares were valid for voting purposes (challenging validity of Respondents' shareholdings). The SC upheld the CA's decision denying the motion. The SC held that the validity or invalidity of shares should be resolved in the main petition, and is already a separate issue in SEC Case No. 05-98-5984.
4.  **Motion for Default:** The RTC did not abuse discretion in denying the motion to declare Respondents in default. The filing of an answer to a supplemental pleading is not mandatory. The Rules of Court applies suppletorily to matters not covered by the Interim Rules. *Sec. 6, Rule 10 and Sec. 7, Rule 11, Rules of Court*.
5.  **Motion for Contempt:** The denial of the Motion to cite Respondents and counsel in contempt was upheld. The SC reiterated that the power to punish for contempt must be exercised on the preservative, not vindictive, principle.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Shares:** The core risk lies in the determination of the validity of Respondent's shareholdings. This issue has a significant impact on control of the corporation and is central to the ongoing litigation. Note the existence of a separate case (SEC Case No. 05-98-5984) specifically addressing share validity.
*   **Mismanagement Allegations:** Underlying the entire dispute are allegations of mismanagement by the petitioners. These allegations, if substantiated, could have legal and reputational implications.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   The decision itself does not establish direct liabilities but the ongoing litigation presents potential liabilities depending on the final outcome.
*   The obligation to follow corporate governance principles and comply with the rulings on share ownership and board meeting validity is paramount.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8799:** Securities Regulation Code.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies (A.M. No. 01-2-04-SC):** Governs procedural aspects.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  Certiorari.
*   **Sec. 6, Rule 10 and Sec. 7, Rule 11, Rules of Court:** Supplemental Pleadings.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA decision, essentially maintaining the status quo *ante*. The key outstanding issues are the validity of Respondents' shareholdings and the underlying allegations of mismanagement, which remain to be litigated in the main action before the RTC. The separate SEC case concerning share validity is highly relevant and its outcome will likely impact the main case. A careful review of the evidence presented in the RTC, particularly concerning the share transfers and corporate records, is essential.
