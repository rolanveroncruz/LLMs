**Legal Document Summary: ASJ Corporation v. Sps. Evangelista, G.R. No. 158086, February 14, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's decision holding ASJ Corporation (ASJ Corp.) and Antonio San Juan (San Juan) solidarily liable for unjustified retention of chicks and egg by-products.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contractual Relationship:** R.M. Sy Chicks (Respondents) engaged ASJ Corp. (owned by San Juan) for hatchery services at a fee of P0.80 per egg.
*   **Accrued Debt:** Respondents incurred unpaid service fees.  As of Setting Report No. 107, the balance was P102,336.80.
*   **Retention:** Petitioners withheld release of chicks and by-products covered by Setting Report Nos. 108-113 due to unpaid fees. San Juan also issued threats.
*   **RTC Decision:**  Ruled in favor of Respondents, piercing the corporate veil and holding ASJ Corp. and San Juan solidarily liable for actual damages (P529,644.80), moral damages (P100,000.00), and attorney's fees (P50,000.00).
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision with the slight modification of including an award of exemplary damages of P10,000.00 in favor of respondents.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Partly granted the petition, with modification.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents' Obligation:** Pay service fees of P0.80 per egg to ASJ Corp.
*   **Petitioners' Initial Obligation:** Release chicks and by-products upon hatching and payment of service fees.
*   **Respondents' Liability (Revised by SC):** Ordered to pay Petitioners P183,416.80 as actual damages because it was the respondents who violated the essence of reciprocity in contracts.
*   **Petitioners' Liability (SC upheld in part):** Liable for moral and exemplary damages due to abuse of rights (threatening the respondents); liable for attorney's fees given award of exemplary damages.

**Key Legal Issues and Case Law:**

*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The SC upheld the piercing of the corporate veil, holding San Juan personally liable due to factors such as significant ownership, control, lack of bona fide separation, and using the corporation to shield himself from liability (citing *Concept Builders, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 108734, May 29, 1996*).
*   **Reciprocal Obligations:**  The Supreme Court considered this case one of non-performance of a reciprocal obligation because respondents delayed in the performance of their obligations, as defined under Article 1169 of the Civil Code.
*   **Right of Retention:** Petitioners had a legal right to retain the chicks and by-products due to Respondents' failure to pay (Art. 1248, Civil Code). There was no valid application of payment.
*   **Abuse of Rights (Art. 19, Civil Code):**  While retention was initially justified, the SC found San Juan's threats constituted an abuse of rights, satisfying the elements of a legal right exercised in bad faith with the intent to injure.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Respondents ordered to pay petitioners P183,416.80 as actual damages for service fees.
    *   Award to respondents of actual damages was reduced to temperate damages of P408,852.10 to account for the value of undelivered chicks and by-products;
    *   Moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees to respondents sustained.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Damages:** Temperate damages awarded required careful calculation to account for conversion rates of eggs to chicks.
*   **Quantification of harm:** The trial court assessed pecuniary loss anchored on petitionersâ€™ abuse of rights.
*   **Ambiguity regarding the exact number of eggs delivered:** Several records show discrepancies on the exact number of eggs delivered.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 19, 1169, 1248, 2208,
