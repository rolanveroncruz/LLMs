**Case Summary: Ruste v. Selma, A.M. No. P-09-2625 (2009)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against a Stenographer III, Cristina Q. Selma, for dereliction of duty.

**Key Facts:**

*   Complainant Elisa Ruste alleged Selma failed to transcribe stenographic notes despite receiving payment (P2,000) for transcription services related to Criminal Case No. 19388 ("People v. Rodriguez") in 2007.
*   Selma admitted failure to transcribe but cited prioritization of other cases needed for imminent hearings as justification.
*   Selma returned the P2,000 after the complaint was filed.
*   OCA found Selma guilty of simple neglect of duty.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Mandates stenographers to transcribe notes and attach them to the case record within 20 days.
*   **Selma's Obligation:** As a Stenographer III, Selma was obligated to transcribe notes promptly and fulfill commitments made for payment of services.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty:** Defined as "the failure of an employee to give attention to a task expected of him," signifying "a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference." See *Inting v. Borja, A.M. No. P-03-1707, July 27, 2004, 435 SCRA 269, 274*.
*   **Penalty:** Fine of P5,000 (instead of suspension due to 22+ years of service). Stern warning issued.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Prioritization":** Selma's defense of prioritizing other cases is weak, especially given the significant delay (over a year). There may be similar cases or interpretations where prioritization of work by court staff is deemed acceptable, leading to inconsistencies in application. The decision emphasizes that being busy is not an adequate excuse.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances (Length of Service):** While Selma's length of service mitigated the penalty, this could be a point of contention in future cases, depending on the severity of the neglect and specific circumstances. This could be deemed a "light" penalty.
*   **Lack of Specific Standards for Excuse:** The decision does not define what constitutes a valid reason for failing to perform transcription duties, leaving room for interpretation.
*   **Reliance on Caselaw:** The decision relies on *Inting v. Borja* and *Ang Kek Chen v. Javalera-Sulit* in explaining simple neglect of duty and the potential of length of service mitigating penalty.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52 (B) (1):** Defines the penalty for simple neglect of duty.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Sets timelines for transcription.
*   **Inting v. Borja, A.M. No. P-03-1707, July 27, 2004, 435 SCRA 269, 274:** Defines simple neglect of duty.
*   **Zamudio v. Auro, A.M. No. P-04-1793, December 8, 2008, 573 SCRA 178, 187**: Length of service considered a mitigating circumstance.
*   **Ang Kek Chen v. Javalera-Sulit, A.M. No. MTJ-06-1649, September 12, 2007, 533 SCRA 11, 26-27.**

**Contentious Clauses:**

The degree to which a stenographer can defer performance of tasks based on prioritization needs is ambiguous, leaving the application of the rule open to the subjective views of the court and creates a potential for inconsistent application of the law.
