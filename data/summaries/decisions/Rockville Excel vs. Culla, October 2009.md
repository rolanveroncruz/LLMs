## Legal Document Summary: Rockville Excel International Exim Corporation vs. Spouses Culla

**Case:** Rockville Excel International Exim Corporation vs. Spouses Oligario Culla and Bernardita Miranda, G.R. No. 155716, October 2, 2009.

**Issue:** Whether the "Deed of Absolute Sale" between Rockville and Spouses Culla constitutes a true sale (specifically *dacion en pago*) or an equitable mortgage of real property.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the purported "Deed of Absolute Sale" was in reality an equitable mortgage. Rockville's petition for specific performance was denied. Spouses Culla are entitled to redeem the property by paying P2,000,000.00 plus legal interest from June 25, 1994.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:** Document purporting to transfer ownership of a 7,074 sqm property (TCT No. T-19538) from Spouses Culla to Rockville for P3,500,000.00. Only Oligario Culla signed the deed.
*   **Loan:** Initial loan of P1,400,000 from Rockville to Spouses Culla, later increased to P2,000,000.00.
*   **Alleged *Dacion en Pago*:** Rockville contends that the Deed of Absolute Sale was payment for the P2,000,000.00 loan plus an additional P1,500,000.00 balance.
*   **P1,500,000.00 Balance:** Rockville claimed willingness to pay this balance upon Bernardita's signature but never actually tendered valid payment.
*   **Redemption Right:** Based on the finding of equitable mortgage, Spouses Culla have the right to redeem the property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Rockville:** Liable for costs.
*   **Spouses Culla:** Obligated to repay the P2,000,000.00 loan with legal interest from June 25, 1994, to redeem the property.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Sale with Only One Spouse's Signature:** The Deed of Absolute Sale was only signed by Oligario Culla. While Rockville argued implied ratification by Bernardita, this was rejected by the courts.  Art. 124 of the Family Code might be implicated depending on when property was acquired.
*   **Determination of Equitable Mortgage:** The court heavily relied on Article 1602 of the Civil Code to construe the purported sale as an equitable mortgage.
*   **Lack of Valid Tender and Consignation:** Rockville's alleged deposit in a foreign bank was deemed insufficient as valid tender of payment and ineffective consignation.
*   **Usury Considerations:** Article 1602 states that any benefits received by the vendee (Rockville) should be considered as interest subject to usury laws. This aspect, while mentioned in the article, was not specifically explored by the court, creating a potential area for further scrutiny regarding the loan's legality.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1602, Civil Code:** Presumption of equitable mortgage. This was the core legal basis for the court's decision.
*   **Article 1604, Civil Code:** Applies Article 1602 to contracts purporting to be absolute sales.
*   **Dacion en Pago:** Definition and elements discussed, citing *Vda. de Jaime, et al. v. CA, G.R. No. 128669, October 4, 2002, 390 SCRA 380*.
*   **Intention of Parties:** Focus on contemporaneous and subsequent acts, citing *Aguirre v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 131520, January 28, 2000, 323 SCRA 771*.
*   **Other relevant jurisprudence:** regarding definition of equitable mortgage, citing *Go v. Bacaron, G.R. No. 159048, October 11, 2005, 472 SCRA 339* and vendors retaining possession of the land, citing *Bernice Legaspi v. Spouses Rita and Francisco Ong, G.R. No. 141311, May 26, 2005, 459 SCRA 122*.

**Potential Arguments for Rockville (Had they Persisted):**

*   **Estoppel:** If Spouses Culla demonstrably benefitted from the original loan and subsequent arrangements, an estoppel argument might be raised.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** Argue that allowing Spouses Culla to retain the property after receiving a benefit from Rockville would constitute unjust enrichment.
*   **Article 124 Family Code**: depending on the circumstances of the loan, this could be argued.

**Conclusion:**

The court focused on the conduct of the parties and the continued grant of extensions by Rockville as key indicators that the transaction was not a true *dacion en pago* but rather an equitable mortgage. The absence of Bernardita's signature and the failure to make valid payment for the balance further weakened Rockville's position.
