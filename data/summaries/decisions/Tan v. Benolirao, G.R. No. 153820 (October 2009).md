## Legal Document Summary: *Delfin Tan v. Erlinda C. Benolirao, et al.* (G.R. No. 153820)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA and RTC decisions regarding the forfeiture of a down payment in a Deed of Conditional Sale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Conditional Sale:** Agreement for the sale of a property in Tagaytay, with a down payment of P200,000 and a balance payable within 150 days.  Forfeiture clause: allows sellers to forfeit down payment and rescind contract if buyer fails to pay within grace period.
*   **Extrajudicial Settlement:** Upon the death of one of the co-owners, Lamberto Benolirao, his heirs executed an extrajudicial settlement, leading to a new TCT.
*   **Annotation on TCT No. 27335 (pursuant to Sec. 4, Rule 74, Rules of Court):** "liability to creditors, excluded heirs and other persons having right to the property, for a period of two (2) years, with respect only to the share of Erlinda, Andrew, Romano and Dion, all surnamed Benolirao."
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:** Respondents sold the property to Hector de Guzman.

**Obligations:**

*   **Buyer (Tan):** Obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price within the agreed time frame.
*   **Sellers (Benolirao et al.):** Obligation to convey a clean title to the property upon full payment of the purchase price.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **For Sellers:** Liability to return the down payment plus legal interest because the annotation on the title (due to the extrajudicial settlement and Rule 74, Sec 4) constituted an encumbrance preventing them from conveying a clean title, thus justifying Tan's refusal to pay the remaining balance.  Risk of liability to excluded heirs or creditors during the two-year period of the annotation.
*   **For Buyer (Tan):** Initial risk of losing down payment due to failure to pay the balance. Overturned on appeal. Risk of buying encumbered land.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 74, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the annotation on the title, which the Court deemed a significant encumbrance. *Vda. de Francisco v. Carreon* (95 Phil. 237 (1954)), *Sps. Domingo v. Roces* (G.R. No. 147468,April 9, 2003, 401 SCRA 197), and *David v. Malay* (G.R. No. 132644, November 19, 1999, 318 SCRA 711) cited on the effect of Section 4, Rule 74 annotation.
*   **Article 1458, Civil Code:** Definition of contract of sale.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 120820, August 1, 2000, 337 SCRA 67):** Distinction between contract to sell and contract of sale in terms of rescission.
*   **Article 1191 of the Civil Code**
*   **Article 1592 of the Civil Code**
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78):** Guidance on awarding legal interest.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deed of Conditional Sale's Characterization:** The document labeled "Deed of Conditional Sale" was found to be, in substance, a contract to sell because the seller retained ownership until full payment, making the buyer's obligation suspensive.
*   **Forfeiture Clause:**  While present, the Court ruled it inapplicable because Tan's failure to pay was not due to his fault but to the vendors' inability to deliver a clean title due to the encumbrance.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Petition granted.  CA decision annulled.
*   Deed of Conditional Sale declared **terminated**, not rescinded.
*   Respondents ordered to return the P200,000 down payment with 6% legal interest from the date of demand (May 28, 1993).
*   Respondents ordered to pay P50,000 in attorney's fees to petitioner.
*   12% interest per annum on the principal obligation and attorney's fees from finality of the decision until fully paid.
*   Dismissed the applicability of a *lis pendens* annotation because this was found to be an *in personam* action.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

The core issue is the impact of a Section 4, Rule 74 annotation on a contract to sell. The Court correctly held that this annotation creates an encumbrance, excusing the buyer from his obligation because the seller could no longer deliver a clean title. Distinguishing between a contract *to sell* and a contract *of sale* is crucial, especially concerning remedies like rescission. The Court's ruling on interest rates follows established jurisprudence (Eastern Shipping Lines). This case provides guidance on the due diligence required when purchasing property subject to an extrajudicial settlement and the rights of a buyer when the seller's title is encumbered by a Rule 74, Sec. 4, annotation. Be aware that this is a *terminating* (not rescinding) scenario.
