## Legal Document Summary: St. Mary's Farm, Inc. vs. Prima Real Properties, Inc.

**Case Summary:**

This is a review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for annulment of sale filed by St. Mary's Farm, Inc. (St. Mary's) against Prima Real Properties, Inc. (Prima), Rodolfo A. Agana, Jr. (Agana), and the Register of Deeds of Las Piñas. St. Mary's sought to annul the sale of land to Prima, alleging Agana, their treasurer, lacked authority and had forged a board resolution authorizing the sale. The lower courts ruled in favor of Prima, finding them to be a buyer in good faith and for value.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Alleged Forgery of Board Resolution:** St. Mary's claims the board resolution authorizing Agana to sell the property was forged, invalidating the subsequent sale.
*   **Authority of Agent:** Central issue revolves around whether Agana possessed the authority to sell the property on behalf of St. Mary's.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** Prima asserts it was a good faith purchaser for value, relying on the notarized board resolution presented by Agana.
*   **Estoppel:** Prima argued St. Mary's was estopped from challenging the sale because its President, Marcelino Agana, Jr., allegedly received part of the purchase price.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **St. Mary's:** Obligated to prove the forgery of the board resolution and lack of authority.
*   **Prima:** Relied on the notarized document, raising the issue of whether they performed sufficient due diligence.
*   **Agana:** Originally defended his authority to sell; later retracted, admitting lack of authority. However, this retraction was given little weight due to it being his first pleading to state this after 8 years.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Evidence:** The NBI's document examination was deemed inconclusive. Variations in the standard signatures may caused questions of authenticity, and the procedure followed for the examination was incorrect.
*   **Notarization Issues:** While non-appearance before the notary public exposes the notary to administrative liability, it does not necessarily invalidate the transaction.
*   **Payment to Agana:** Checks were payable to Agana, not St. Mary's, however, the court found the payment to Agana no longer warranted further inquiry to the certification held.
*   **Agana's Retraction:** Agana's eleventh-hour retraction, admitting lack of authority, is viewed skeptically and not considered a valid basis for reversing the lower courts' decisions due to being raised after 8 years.
*   **Judicial Admissions:** Agana's prior assertions of authority are considered judicial admissions, binding him to that position.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits the Supreme Court's review to questions of law, deferring to lower court factual findings.
*   **Bautista v. Silva, G.R. No. 157434, September 19, 2006, 502 SCRA 334:** Defines a "buyer for value in good faith" and the conditions under which reliance on a title is sufficient. Outlines when a buyer need not prove further inquiry.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The court refers to the truthfulness of the document based on it being notarized.
*   **Heirs of Pedro Clemeña y Zurbano v. Heirs of Irene B. Bien, G.R. No. 155508, September 11, 2006, 501 SCRA 405, 414-415:** A judicial admission conclusively binds the party making it.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Agana's Authority:** The extent of Agana's authority is a contentious point. St. Mary's argued it was limited to negotiation, while Prima relied on the board resolution language authorizing him to "sign any and all documents...to bind the Corporation."

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

The petitioner, St. Mary's Farm, Inc., faced a high risk of losing, as the courts focused on the Prima's status as a buyer in good faith based on the notarized documents presented. St. Mary's was unable to provide sufficient evidence that the board resolution was forged to overcome the presumption of validity of the transaction. Agana's eventual recantation of authority has been dismissed due to the court's observation that it was an afterthought. The case highlights the importance of verifying the authenticity of notarized documents, the risk associated with the appearance of due authorization, and the significance of consistent pleading.
