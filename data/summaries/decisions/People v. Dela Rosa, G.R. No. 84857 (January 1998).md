## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Rodolfo dela Rosa y Aviles*, G.R. No. 84857

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Rodolfo dela Rosa y Aviles, et al.* (G.R. No. 84857, January 16, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction by the Regional Trial Court of Lingayen, Pangasinan for illegal possession of firearms and explosives under Presidential Decree No. 1866.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of PD 1866 for unlawful possession of three homemade shotguns and fourteen sticks of dynamite.
*   **Factual Background:** Accused Rodolfo dela Rosa, along with others, surrendered to authorities, turning over the firearms and explosives. The defense argues lack of intent to possess ( *animus possidendi* ), claiming they only intended to surrender the items.
*   **Core Legal Issue:** Whether the act of surrendering illegally possessed firearms and explosives absolves the accused of liability under PD 1866. The prosecution needs to prove possession and the lack of a license.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court acquitted Rodolfo dela Rosa.

**Reasoning/Analysis:**

*   **Animus Possidendi:** The court emphasized that while illegal possession under PD 1866 is *malum prohibitum* (intent to commit the crime is not necessary), the prosecution must still prove *animus possidendi* – the intent to possess. Cites *People v. de Gracia* and *People v. Estoista* regarding temporary, incidental, or harmless possession not being punishable. The court considers *People v. Remereta* relating to transient possession and *People v. Leo Lian* where an intention to surrender was feigned. Dela Rosa’s act of immediate surrender demonstrated a lack of *animus possidendi*.
*   **Lack of License:** The prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence proving lack of authority or license. References *People v. Solayao* regarding the prosecution's burden to prove a negative averment (lack of license) beyond reasonable doubt, and cites that a certification from the Firearms and Explosives Unit would be better. An extrajudicial admission alone is insufficient and any statement the accused made was uncounselled, which is a possible violation of the accused's constitutional rights.
*   **Burden of Proof & Presumption of Innocence:** The Court highlights that the burden rests on the prosecution to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Mere suspicion (e.g., joining the NPA implying possession of firearms) is insufficient, citing *People v. Argawanon*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Cases:** While this case provides a narrow exception, future defendants may attempt to claim similar "surrender" defenses. Clear evidence of intent to possess, prior to surrender, could still lead to conviction.
*   **Lack of Clarity:** The line between "temporary possession" and "possession with *animus possidendi*" remains somewhat subjective. The surrounding circumstances are crucial.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Explosives). Amended by Republic Act No. 8294.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. de Gracia* (233 SCRA 716) - Definition of "possession" under PD 1866.
*   *People v. Estoista* (93 Phil. 647) - Temporary, incidental possession is not punishable.
*   *People v. Remereta* (98 Phil. 413) - Transient possession is not sufficient.
*   *People v. Leo Lian* (G.R. No. 115988) - Feigned intent to surrender.
*   *People v. Solayao* (262 SCRA 256) - Burden to prove lack of license.
*   *People v. Argawanon* (231 SCRA 614) - Mere suspicion is insufficient.
*   *People v. Lubo* (101 Phil. 180)

**Conclusion:** This case highlights the importance of proving both *animus possidendi* and lack of license beyond a reasonable doubt in illegal possession cases under PD 1866. It establishes a narrow exception for individuals who, without prior intent to possess for their own use, surrender illegally possessed firearms and explosives to the authorities. The decision emphasizes the constitutional presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proof, even in cases involving *malum prohibitum*.
