## Legal Document Summary: De La Cruz v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 120652)

**Core Issue:** Ownership of a 407 sq. meter residential lot in Bulacan based on acquisitive prescription. Petitioner De La Cruz (DLC) claims ownership based on long-term, open, continuous, and adverse possession. Respondent Villanueva (V), purchased the lot from the Ramos brothers, who obtained title after a land reclassification.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, denying DLC's claim for reconveyance.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **DLC's Claim:** Possession for over 30 years, dating back to a 1930 purchase by his uncle. Relies on *Republic v. Court of Appeals and Miguel Marcelo, et al.* (168 SCRA 77), arguing his good faith possession should prevail over subsequent classification. Also argues estoppel based on a mortgage agreement with V's parents.
*   **V's Claim:** Purchase from the Ramos brothers, who successfully pursued reclassification of the land from forest reserve to alienable/disposable.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   **Inapplicability of *Republic v. CA*:**  Distinguished based on timing. In *Republic v. CA*, the land was classified *after* the claimant's good faith possession. Here, DLC possessed the land *after* it had been classified as forest reserve.
    *   **Prescription Against the Government:**  Forest lands are not subject to prescription.  Cites Article 1113 of the Civil Code. *Republic v. IAC, 186 SCRA 88 (1990)*; *Director of Lands vs. CA, 178 SCRA 708 (1989)*. Possession, however long, cannot convert forest land into private property. *Director of Forest Administration vs. Fernandez, 192 SCRA 121 (1990)*.
    *   **Estoppel:** Rejected the estoppel argument. While mortgagees are generally estopped from challenging the mortgagor's ownership, DLC lacked the capacity to encumber the land at the time of the mortgage because it was forest land.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Land Registration Act (Act No. 496), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1529:** Referenced in the context of the Ramos brothers' application for registration.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1113:**  Prescription does not run against property of the State that is not patrimonial in character.

**Case Law:**

*   **Republic vs. Court of Appeals and Miguel Marcelo, et al., 168 SCRA 77 (1988):** Distinguished by the Court.  In that case, the claimant's possession predated land classification.
*   **Amerol vs. Bagumbaran, 154 SCRA 396 (1987):** Defines the nature of an action for reconveyance.
*   **Director of Lands vs. Court of Appeals, 178 SCRA 708 (1989):**  Requires a "positive act" by the government to declassify forest land. *Heirs of Proceso Bautista vs. Barza, 208 SCRA 454 (1992)*.
*   **Director of Forest Administration vs. Fernandez, 192 SCRA 121 (1990):** Forest lands cannot be acquired by prescription.
*   **Republic vs. IAC, 186 SCRA 88 (1990):** Same as above.
*   **Heirs of Jose Amunategui vs. Director of Forestry, 126 SCRA 69 (1983):** Classification of land is descriptive of legal status, not necessarily actual appearance.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Deed of Sale (1930):** The CA found that DLC had not proven the 1930 sale that purportedly initiated his family's claim.
*   **Reliance on "Good Faith":** While DLC argued good faith, the court implies that he was not a good faith possessor, as the land was classified as forest land at the commencement of his possession.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court's decision is firmly grounded in established jurisprudence regarding prescription against the state and the classification of forest lands. DLC's reliance on *Republic v. CA* was unsuccessful due to differing factual circumstances. The estoppel argument was weak due to the initial incapacity of DLC to validly mortgage the land.
