## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Callao and Amad (G.R. No. 228945)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Hesson Callao y Marcelino and Junello Amad*

**Court/Date:** Supreme Court, March 14, 2018 (affirming CA Decision of August 31, 2016, which affirmed with modifications the RTC Judgment of January 26, 2015)

**Nature:** Appeal under Rule 124, Section 13 of the Rules of Court, from CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Accusation:** Hesson and Junello, conspiring together, with treachery, attacked and killed Fernando Adlawan with an iron rod and knife, removing and feeding his organs to pigs.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution Witness Sario:** Sario, present at the scene, testified to the planning and execution of the crime by Hesson and Junello, including the specific acts of violence against the victim. He admitted to being threatened, hence the delayed report.
    *   **Death Certificate:** Confirmed cause of death as internal hemorrhage due to multiple stab wounds.
*   **Defense:** Hesson claimed denial and alleged Junello and Enrile were the perpetrators. Claimed being at the scene but fearing for his life after witnessing the event.
*   **Trial Court Finding:** Hesson guilty of Murder based on credible testimony of lone prosecution witness Sario and his positive identification. The court found that treachery was proved.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed conviction with modifications to damages awarded.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision and rejected all assigned errors.

**Key Issues & Rulings:**

1.  **Sufficiency of Uncorroborated Testimony:** Held that the testimony of a lone eyewitness (Sario), if credible, is sufficient for conviction. *People v. Hillado*, 367 Phil. 29 (1999) cited. Witness credibility assessment by the trial court is given great weight *People v. Gabrino*, 660 Phil. 485 (2011)
2.  **Conspiracy:** Found conspiracy existed based on the coordinated actions of Hesson and Junello, revealing a common criminal design. Unity of action and purpose established, which implies collective liability.
3.  **Impossible Crime:** The defense argued the victim was already dead when Hesson stabbed him, thus constituting an impossible crime. However, the Court ruled the defense failed to establish the victim was already dead. Moreover, even if the victim was already dead, the SC pointed out that the presence of conspiracy between Hesson and Junello implicates Hesson in the prior death of the victim. Rejected this argument because (1) fact of death not sufficiently established and (2) even if true, conspiracy makes Hesson liable for Junello's actions. *Intod v. Court of Appeals*, 289 Phil. 485 (1992) and *People v. Peralta*, 134 Phil. 703 (1968) cited

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Hesson Callao y Marcelino: Guilty of Murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Civil liability to the heirs of Fernando Adlawan: P75,000 civil indemnity, P75,000 moral damages, P30,000 exemplary damages, P15,000 funeral expenses. All monetary awards to earn legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Single Witness:** Despite the ruling, reliance on a single uncorroborated witness is always a potential point of vulnerability.
*   **Determination of Death:** The ambiguous determination of the victim's actual time of death could be challenged, although the conspiracy finding mitigates this.
