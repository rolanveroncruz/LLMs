## Legal Document Summary: *Benong-Linde v. Lomantas* (A.M. No. P-18-3842)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Feladelfa L. Lomantas, Social Welfare Officer II, for abuse of authority, dishonesty, and conduct unbecoming a court employee.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant (Benong-Linde) filed for custody of her grandchildren (SP Proc. No. 2853) after her son and his partner separated.
*   Respondent allegedly pressured complainant to allow a case study before summons was served, stating the case's outcome depended on her influence.
*   Respondent allegedly participated in the removal of a grandchild from complainant's custody, even pushing complainant, and boasted about her court employee status.
*   The case was initially archived due to failure to serve summons on the father.
*   An Affidavit of Desistance was filed by complainant but was not given effect by the court.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   Court employees must maintain high ethical standards.
*   Social Welfare Officers must act impartially.
*   Public office is a public trust (based on the Constitution).

**Liabilities/Findings:**

*   **Simple Misconduct:** Respondent's actions constituted simple misconduct for improperly intervening in an archived custody case, displaying bias, and exhibiting arrogance by suggesting influence and flaunting her position.
*   Premature intervention in the case (before summons, after archiving) without proper court order.
*   Respondent demonstrated bias and partiality towards one party (Aloha).
*   Respondent abused her position as a court employee.

**Penalty:** Fine equivalent to one month's salary, deducted from retirement benefits due to respondent's retirement on September 2, 2017, in lieu of suspension.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** While filed, it was correctly disregarded based on *Sy v. Binasing* (563 Phil. 491 (2007)) due to the Supreme Court's inherent power to investigate its employees regardless of private arrangements.
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** Some allegations rely on witness testimony and the police blotter.
*   **Subjectivity of "Arrogance":** The determination of arrogance rests on the teacher's affidavit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sy v. Binasing (563 Phil. 491 (2007)):** Affirmed court's jurisdiction to investigate employee misconduct despite complainant's desistance.
*   **Judge Yrastorza, Sr. v. Latiza (462 Phil. 145, 153 (2003)):** Emphasized the high ethical standards required of court employees.
*   **Campos v. Judge Campos (681 Phil. 247, 254 (2012)):** Defined simple misconduct as a transgression of an established rule.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Classified simple misconduct as a less grave offense.
*   **Philippine Constitution:**  Highlights the principle that public office is a public trust.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The subjective interpretation of "arrogance" relies heavily on the teacher's testimony about the respondent's statements.
*   The extent of damage inflicted on the complainant when pushed out of the vehicle.

**Recommendations:**

*   The OCA's actions align with existing jurisprudence, particularly regarding the importance of ethical conduct for judicial employees and the court's authority to investigate regardless of an Affidavit of Desistance.
*   The penalty of the fine serves as a deterrent for similar misconduct in the future.
