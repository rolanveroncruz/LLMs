**Case Summary: *Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and Federico Dagasdas*, G.R. No. 122440, February 12, 1998 (349 Phil. 986)**

**Core Issue:** Determination of the appropriate salary rate (overseas vs. local) for computing backwages owed to illegally dismissed employee, Federico Dagasdas.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Dagasdas was a regular "work pool" employee of PNCC.
*   He worked on a PNCC project in the Middle East (1979-1984) at a rate of $2.20/hour.
*   After the overseas project's completion, PNCC failed to provide him with local work.
*   Dagasdas filed an illegal dismissal suit, which was initially dismissed, then reversed by the NLRC, ordering reinstatement and backwages (3 years).
*   Dispute arose regarding the basis for calculating backwages: NLRC used the overseas salary rate, resulting in P468,700. PNCC argued for using the local rate at the time of Dagasdas' transfer overseas (resulting in P28,392).

**NLRC & Labor Arbiter Rulings:**

*   Labor Arbiter initially favored PNCC's local salary rate computation.
*   NLRC reversed, reinstating the computation based on the overseas rate.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the NLRC decision, reinstating the Labor Arbiter's order.
*   SC held the NLRC gravely abused its discretion by using the overseas salary rate.

**Rationale:**

*   Dagasdas was not illegally dismissed *during* his overseas assignment. His contract was for a specific project and definite term; he received all benefits due to him under that contract.
*   Reinstatement refers to his position as a member of PNCC's *local* work pool.
*   Backwages should restore the income he *would have* received had he been assigned to local projects after his return, which would have been the *local* wage.
*   SC cited the principle that salary scales reflect the standard of living and purchasing power of the domestic currency (*Grolier International, Inc., vs. Amansec, G.R. No. 83523*).

**Obligations:**

*   PNCC is obligated to pay Dagasdas backwages based on his *local* salary rate at the time he was transferred to the overseas project.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability to pay backwages significantly reduced compared to the NLRC's initial computation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The precise local salary rate "at the time of his transfer to overseas project" might be subject to dispute. Further evidence may be needed to establish this rate definitively.
*   The SC emphasizes the principle of restoring the employee to the same position prior to the illegal dismissal, but the practical application of this principle to "work pool" employees and fluctuating assignment-based wages might create future disputes if not carefully monitored.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   *Santos vs. National Labor Relations Commission, No. L-76721, September 21, 1987, 154 SCRA 166* (Purpose of reinstatement and backwages)
*   *Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Communications vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 82511, March 3, 1992, 206 SCRA 701* (Nature of backwages as a restoration of lost income).
*   *Grolier International, Inc., vs. Amansec, G.R. No. 83523, August 31, 1989, 177 SCRA 196.* (Salary scales reflecting standard of living).

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The critical contentious point was whether the expired overseas contract salary rate could be used to compute backwages. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected this, linking backwages to the "loss" in the *local* context.
