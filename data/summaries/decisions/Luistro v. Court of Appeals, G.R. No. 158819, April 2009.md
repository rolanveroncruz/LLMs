**Case Summary: *Antero Luistro v. Court of Appeals and First Gas Power Corporation***

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Citation:** G.R. No. 158819, April 16, 2009 (603 Phil. 243)

**Facts:** Petitioner Luistro entered into a Contract of Easement of Right-of-Way (Contract) with Respondent First Gas Power Corporation (FGPC) allowing FGPC to construct a transmission line across his property. Luistro later filed suit to rescind/amend the contract, alleging fraud and misrepresentation, specifically claiming FGPC assured him his house would be a certain distance from the transmission line but it was closer than promised. The trial court denied FGPC's motion to dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed, finding a failure to state a cause of action and insufficient pleading of fraud.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Easement:** Grants FGPC a perpetual easement for a 100-sq. m. portion for tower construction and a 25-year easement over 2,453.60 sq. m. for overhead lines.  Specifies payment to Luistro for easement fee, tower pole, guy occupancy fees and improvements
*   **FGPC's Obligations:**  Limited to terms outlined in the Contract of Easement, which do not include a specific distance requirement between the transmission line and Luistro's house.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Luistro's Potential Liability:** Risk of paying FGPC's legal fees should any claims that FGPC breached the contract.
*   **FGPC's Potential Liability:** Could have been liable for breach of contract and damages had Luistro been able to prove fraud or that FGPC violated any terms of the contract.

**Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Failure to State a Cause of Action:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA ruling, holding that Luistro's complaint failed to state a cause of action because the alleged promise regarding the distance of the transmission line from his house was not contained in the written Contract of Easement. The complaintâ€™s allegations were based on an extra-contractual promise not legally binding.
*   **Pleading Fraud with Particularity (Rule 8, Section 5, Rules of Civil Procedure):** The Court held that Luistro failed to plead fraud with sufficient particularity.  He merely made general allegations of "misrepresentation, promises, false and fraudulent assurances, and tricks" without specifying the circumstances of the alleged fraud (who made the representations, when, where, how).  General averments of fraud are insufficient.
*   **Sufficiency of Trial Court Order (Rule 16, Section 3, Rules of Civil Procedure):** The Court agreed the trial court failed to state clearly and distinctly the reasons for denying the Motion to Dismiss, merely stating that a cause of action sufficiently existed without explanation.
*   **"Bago ko/namin nilagdaan" Clause**: Because Luistro acknowledged in the contract that its contents were fully explained to him in a language he understood and that he signed it voluntarily, the court found no basis for his claims.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 8, Section 5, Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Requires particularity in pleading fraud or mistake.
*   **Rule 16, Section 3, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Requires trial court orders to clearly and distinctly state reasons for resolutions.
*   **Article 19 of the Civil Code**: Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None apparent; the issue hinges on the absence of a specific clause regarding transmission line distance.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court denied Luistro's petition, upholding the CA's dismissal of the case. The ruling emphasizes the importance of clear, written contracts and the need to plead fraud with particularity.  It highlights the principle that a cause of action must be based on a legal right that has been violated, and that such right must be grounded in a valid contract or law.
