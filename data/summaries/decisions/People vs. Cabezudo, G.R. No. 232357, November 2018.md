Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided *People v. Cabezudo* decision:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Edwin Cabezudo y Rieza*, G.R. No. 232357, November 28, 2018 (844 Phil. 227)

**Issue:** Whether the RTC and CA erred in convicting Cabezudo of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs).

**Holding:** Yes.  The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, acquitting Cabezudo due to the prosecution's failure to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  The prosecution must prove (1) identity of buyer/seller, object, and consideration, and (2) delivery and payment.  Crucially, *corpus delicti* (the drug itself) must be proven.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** While legally sanctioned, strict compliance with RA 9165, Section 21's chain of custody requirements is crucial to safeguard rights.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21 (Chain of Custody):** Mandates immediate inventory and photographing of seized items *after* seizure in the presence of (a) the accused or representative/counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a media representative, and (d) a DOJ representative; all must sign the inventory.  Deviation is allowed only under justifiable grounds, with preservation of integrity and evidentiary value of seized items.
*   **Fatal Flaw:** The Court found critical non-compliance with Section 21. Representatives from the media and DOJ were not present at the time of seizure and apprehension. The inventory was done only in the presence of a barangay official. This deviation was not acknowledged or justified by the prosecution.
*   **Case Law:** The Court cites various precedents emphasizing strict compliance with Section 21 to maintain the integrity of the *corpus delicti* and prevent planting/contamination of evidence (e.g., *People v. Santos, Jr.*; *People v. Tomawis*; *People v. Mendoza*; *People v. Reyes*). It references the need to prove compliance, citing *People v. Lim*, *People v. Umipang*, and the consequences of the failure to do so.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **State's Burden:** To prove each element of the crime *and* strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165. The prosecution must recognize any lapse on the part of the police officers and then be able to justify the same

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The lower courts erred in relying on the presumption of regularity of police action. The Supreme Court held that this presumption cannot override the accused's constitutional presumption of innocence. The presumption is not applicable where there are serious lapses on the part of law enforcement. This presumption cannot be used to bypass strict compliance with RA 9165.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Cabezudo because the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody due to the lack of proper witness presence during the inventory and failure to justify this deviation from Section 21, RA 9165. The ruling underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases to protect the accused's rights and prevent abuse.
