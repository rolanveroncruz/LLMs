## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 205688

**Case:** *Valentino S. Lingat and Aproniano Altoveros v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., Monte Dapples Trading, and David Lyons*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Date:** July 4, 2018

**Nature of Document:** Decision regarding illegal dismissal claims.

**Key Issue:** Whether petitioners Lingat and Altoveros were regular employees of Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI) or employees of an independent contractor, Monte Dapples Trading Corp. (MDTC), and whether they were illegally dismissed.

**Holding:** SC reversed the CA decision, holding that Lingat and Altoveros were regular employees of CCBPI and were illegally dismissed. The SC finds CCBPI and MDTC solidarily liable and awards separation pay and attorney's fees to Petitioners.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Regular Employment:** The SC applied the two-tiered test under Article 295 of the Labor Code (formerly Article 280). It held that the petitioners' tasks (plant driver, forklift operator, and segregator/mixer) were necessary and desirable to CCBPI's core business (manufacturing, distribution, and sale of soft drinks). The SC emphasizes the continuous nature of their work for CCBPI, despite being transferred through various agencies, indicating indispensability.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** SC determined that MDTC was a labor-only contractor, not a legitimate independent contractor. While MDTC possessed capital, the SC emphasized that capital is only *one* element (citing *Quintanar v. Coca-Cola Bottlers, Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 210565). The Court highlighted that the petitioners' work was directly related to CCBPI's core business, not merely to warehousing services as argued by CCBPI. SC relies on *Diamond Farms, Inc. v. Southern Philippines Federation of Labor (SPFL)*, 778 Phil. 72 (2016) in its labor-only contractor discussion.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Court found no just cause for dismissal, and no due process was afforded to the petitioners. The termination stemmed from the non-renewal of the Warehousing Management Agreement between CCBPI and MDTC, which is not a valid ground for dismissing regular employees.
*   **Prescription:** The Court of Appeals determined the claim was not prescribed. While the NLRC determined the claim was filed beyond the statute of limitations, the appellate court stated Lingat sought not only monetary compensation but also reinstatement, triggering the statute of limitations in Article 1146 of the Civil Code and allowing the filing of the complaint. The Supeme Court did not directly address prescription as it sided with CA on this issue.

**Obligations:**

*   **CCBPI and MDTC (Solidarily Liable):**
    *   Pay separation pay to both Lingat and Altoveros in lieu of reinstatement.
    *   Pay attorney's fees of 10% of the monetary award.
    *   Pay legal interest of 6% per annum on all monetary awards from the finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   CCBPI and MDTC are held solidarily liable for the illegal dismissal of the petitioners.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Findings:** The SC acknowledged that factual determinations are typically outside the scope of certiorari, but made an exception due to conflicting findings among the LA, NLRC, and CA. This could be a point of contention if the respondents seek further review.
*   **Independent Contractor Argument:** CCBPI and Lyons argued that MDTC was a legitimate and independent job contractor, which was struck down by the court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 295 (formerly Article 280):** Defines regular employment.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1146:** Statute of limitations applicable to claims for reinstatement.
*   **Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Agito, 598 Phil. 909 (2009):** Used as precedent in determining whether a person is a regular employee.
*   **Pacquing v. Coca-Cola Philippines, Inc., 567 Phil. 323 (2008):** Used as precedent in determining whether a person is a regular employee.
*   **Quintanar v. Coca-Cola Bottlers, Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 210565, June 28, 2016, 794 SCRA 654:** Used as precedent in determining whether a person is a regular employee.
*   **Diamond Farms, Inc. v. Southern Philippines Federation of Labor (SPFL)-Workers Solidarity of DARBMUPCO/Diamond-SPFL, 778 Phil. 72 (2016):** Discusses the requirements of a legitimate independent contractor versus a labor-only contractor.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether MDTC was a legitimate independent contractor or a labor-only contractor appears to be the most contentious point, with the CA disagreeing with the LA.
