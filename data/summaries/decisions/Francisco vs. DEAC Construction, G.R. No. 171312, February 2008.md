**Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Lino Francisco & Guia Francisco v. DEAC Construction, Inc. and Geomar A. Dadula*, G.R. No. 171312, February 4, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the RTC's partial rescission of a Construction Contract and award of damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Construction Contract (September 13, 1994):** Spouses Francisco (Owners) contracted DEAC Construction, Inc. (Contractor) for the construction of a 3-story residential building for P3,500,000.00. Down payment of P2,000,000.00 was paid. Installments tied to completion stages.
*   **Deviation from Plans:**  Critical issue is whether the Spouses Francisco authorized deviations from approved building plans (closing of open space, setback reduction).
*   **Building Permit:** DEAC was obligated to obtain the building permit before construction but failed to do so.  Construction began *before* permit issuance, leading to criminal charges against Lino Francisco.
*   **National Building Code Violations (PD 1096):** Multiple violations cited by the Building Official, including setback violations (Sec. 306), covering the required open patio (Sec. 306), window opening issues (Sec. 1007), and safety concerns.
*   **Alleged Forgery:** Signature of Guia Francisco on amended building plans was allegedly forged by DEAC's representative.
*   **Art. 1191, Civil Code:** Basis for rescission, citing breach of faith in reciprocal obligations.

**Obligations:**

*   **DEAC:** Obtain necessary permits, adhere to approved plans, perform quality workmanship, and properly supervise construction.
*   **Spouses Francisco:** Make timely payments as per the contract milestones.

**Liabilities:**

*   **DEAC/Dadula (Initially):** Trial court found liable for breach of contract, ordering partial rescission and damages. Appellate Court reversed. The Supreme Court reinstates the Trial Court Decision, which will make DEAC and Dadula liable for the refund of P205,000 representing the excess payment to cover unfinished work as per contract.
*   **Spouses Francisco (Initially):** Appellate Court held liable for the remaining balance of the contract price, moral damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Reversed by Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Authorization:** Whether the Spouses Francisco *actually* authorized the plan deviations is contentious. The Supreme Court finds that they did not authorize the deviations.
*   **Waiver:**  DEAC argued that the Spouses Francisco waived their right to rescission due to delayed complaints. However, the Supreme Court found that the actions of the Spouses indicated that no waiver occurred.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the partial rescission (undoing or compensating for the unfinished portion) given the partially completed state of the building.
*   **Damage Assessment:** Valuation of damages arising from the breach and defects.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096 (National Building Code of the Philippines):** Specifically Sections 301, 306, 1007.  Violations of the NBC are central to the case.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1191:** Implied power to rescind reciprocal obligations in case of breach. Cited in determining appropriateness of rescission and the breach of reciprocal obligations.
*   *Pryce Corporation v. Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, G.R. No. 157480, 6 May 2005, 458 SCRA 164, 177, citing the Concurring Opinion of Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes in Universal Food Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 144 Phil. 1 (1970).*  Rescission based on breach of faith, not just economic injury.
*   *Tan Guat v. Pamintuan, C.A. 37 O.G. 2494,* Precedent for partial rescission of construction contracts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Authorization of Deviations:**  The agreement regarding balcony extension was misinterpreted by the CA as consent to closing the open space and reducing the setback. The Supreme Court clarified that these were distinct issues.

**Key Takeaways:**

DEAC breached the contract by failing to secure a building permit before construction, deviating from approved plans without authorization, and violating the National Building Code. The Spouses Francisco are entitled to partial rescission (limited to the unfinished portion of the contract) and refund of the overpayment for the undelivered portion, per the Trial Court's decision which was reinstated by the Supreme Court. The alleged waiver defense failed because Spouses Francisco complained about and took legal action within a reasonable timeframe.
