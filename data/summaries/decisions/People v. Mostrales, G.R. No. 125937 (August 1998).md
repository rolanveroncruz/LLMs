## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Mostrales*, G.R. No. 125937 (1998)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Roberto Mostrales

**Facts:** Accused Roberto Mostrales was convicted of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code for the rape of Teodocia Mabunga, a married, pregnant woman. The prosecution alleged that Mostrales, armed with a gun and posing as an NPA member, intimidated the victim and forced her to have intercourse with him three times. The defense argued that the intercourse was consensual, alleging a prior adulterous relationship and claiming the victim falsely accused him after being caught by her husband.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, intimidation, or when she is deprived of reason. Prescribes the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Intimidation as Element of Rape:** The court emphasizes that intimidation is subjective and depends on the victim's perception at the time of the crime.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused is obligated to pay the victim P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape under Article 335.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The central issue is the credibility of the victim versus the accused. The court found the victim's testimony credible, particularly her immediate report and willingness to undergo examination, while discrediting the accused's inconsistent and uncorroborated defense.
*   **Defense of Consent:** The accused's attempt to argue consent based on a prior adulterous relationship was weak, failing to overcome the evidence of intimidation. The defense did not presented evidence to back their allegations, such as witness statements.
*   **Evidence of Intimidation:** The court relied heavily on the accused's display of a firearm and his false claim of being an NPA member as evidence of intimidation. The fact that the victim was pregnant and living in an isolated area further supported the finding of intimidation.
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court clarified that moral damages and civil indemnity are distinct awards, each with different legal bases.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Ambiguities:**

*   The information does not say weather the accused was authorized to carry a firearm.
*   The timing discrepancies in the accused's testimony regarding the alleged adulterous affair raise questions about his credibility.

**Overall:**

The case hinges on the prosecution proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's sexual intercourse with the accused was non-consensual due to force or intimidation. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's conviction, emphasizing the victim's credibility and the accused's use of intimidation. The case also clarifies the distinction between civil indemnity and moral damages in rape cases and establishes specific amounts awarded to the victim.
