**Case Summary: Aurora B. Go v. Teresita C. Remotigue, A.M. No. P-05-1969 (June 12, 2008)**

**Nature of Case:** Administrative complaint against Teresita C. Remotigue, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities-OCC, Cebu City, for Conduct Unbecoming a Court Employee.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Trust Agreement (June 10, 2003):** Formalized a lending business agreement between complainant Aurora Go and respondent Remotigue. Go provided P150,000 capital; Remotigue managed the lending business; 10% monthly interest was to be split equally.
*   **Remotigue's Obligations:** To manage the lending business, collect loan payments, remit Go's 50% share of the interest monthly, and eventually return the principal upon termination. Go had right to terminate the lending operations with 30 days' notice. Remotigue had the right to withdraw from the agreement, provided she had liquidated and accounted for the amount entrusted to her and the supposed interest gained.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Violation of Administrative Circular No. 5:** Remotigue was found guilty of engaging directly in a private business (lending), which is prohibited for judiciary employees, regardless of whether it's outside office hours or impacts official duties. This is pursuant to Section 12, Rule XVIII of the Revised Civil Service Rules.
*   **OCA's Recommendation:** Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended suspension for one month without pay.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Court adopted the OCA's recommendation and suspended Remotigue for one month without pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 5 (October 4, 1988):** Prohibits judiciary officials and employees from engaging directly in private business, vocation, or profession, including being insurance agents. Enacted to ensure efficient administration of justice.
*   **Article 1159 of the Civil Code:** Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between contracting parties.
*   **Relevant Cases Cited:** The decision cites numerous cases demonstrating the Court's consistent application of Administrative Circular No. 5, imposing various sanctions based on the offense's gravity and the employee's record (e.g., *Abeto vs. Garcesa*, *Quiroz vs. Orfila*, *Gasulas vs. Maralit*). *Biyaheros Mart Livelihood Association, Inc. vs. Cabusao, Jr.*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Termination Clause:** The Trust Agreement stipulates a 30 day prior notice to cease operations on the First Party's end. The agreement further stipulates that once notified of the intention to stop operations, the Second Party shall cease to shell out money for clients, though the operation shall continue as far as collection and enforcement of the loan are concerned. A clearer stipulation as to the Second Party's obligations upon withdrawal from the agreement or termination of the operations could have prevented the suit.
*   **Enforcement:** The legal basis for the adminstrative case relies heavily on the Trust Agreement; any ambiguity could complicate the enforcement. The Court, however, viewed it as a straightforward violation given the document's clear terms.
*   **Financial Liability:** While the administrative matter focused on the violation of conduct rules, the underlying issue involves a financial dispute. A separate civil action may be pursued to recover the outstanding principal and interest from the lending agreement.
