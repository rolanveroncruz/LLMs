## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Aranjuez*, G.R. No. 121898

**Case Overview:** This is a criminal case where Rene Aranjuez (Accused-Appellant) appeals his conviction for murder by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Bacolod City. The victim, Godofredo Ferrer, was stabbed multiple times, resulting in death. The RTC found Aranjuez guilty based on eyewitness testimony, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay the heirs of the victim P50,000.00. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, qualified by treachery.
*   **Accused-Appellant's Defenses:** Denial and alibi, claiming he was at his workplace at the time of the incident.
*   **RTC Findings Upheld:** The Supreme Court gave weight to the RTC's assessment of witness credibility, stating that the trial court is in the best position to evaluate witness demeanor.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Primary evidence against Aranjuez was the positive identification by the victim's wife and son, who were present at the scene. The Court gave credence to their testimonies, ruling that the close relation of the witnesses to the victim does not undermine their credibility.
*   **Alibi Rejection:** Aranjuez's alibi was rejected for lack of credible corroboration and failure to demonstrate physical impossibility of being at the crime scene. The court noted that the workplace where Aranjuez claimed to be was in the same *barangay* as the crime scene. Cites *People v. Cordero, 263 SCRA 122 (1996)* and *People v. Aliposa, 263 SCRA 472 (1996)*
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's finding of treachery, noting that the attack was sudden and unexpected, giving the victim no opportunity to defend himself. The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without warning and in a swift, deliberate and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape, according to *People v. Zamora, G.R. No. 101829, August 21, 1997.* Treachery may be committed even if the attack is frontal, but no less sudden and unexpected, giving the victim no opportunity to repel it or offer any defense of his person, according to *People v. Apongan, G.R. No. 112369, April 4, 1997.*
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** Aranjuez's flight to Iloilo City immediately after the incident was used as evidence of his guilt.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay P50,000.00 to the heirs of Godofredo Ferrer y Guardiano.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is criminally liable for murder.
*   Accused-Appellant is civilly liable to the victim's heirs for damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Credibility:** While the court upheld the credibility of the eyewitnesses, cross-examination could have focused on potential bias, memory fallibility due to the stress of the situation, and possible inconsistencies in their testimonies.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The reliance on flight as an indication of guilt could be challenged as it assumes guilt rather than proving it.
*   **Treachery:** The defense argued that the location of the wounds did not definitively prove the attack was from behind. Whether the attack was sufficiently "sudden and unexpected" despite being potentially frontal could be further scrutinized.
*   **Earning Capacity:** The original information requested compensation for loss of earning capacity, and as the court sided with the plantiff, the court could have elaborated further.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (Article defining murder and penalties).
