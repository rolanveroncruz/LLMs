## Summary of *Bernal v. Villaflor* (G.R. No. 213617)

This is a petition for review assailing the CA's decision regarding the interest rate on a monetary award stemming from a construction dispute.  Bernal sued the Villaflors for unpaid sums related to the construction of a Medical Arts Building. The RTC initially awarded Bernal Php2,848,000.00 plus interest. The CA modified the RTC decision, reducing the award to Php1,710,271.21 and setting interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the judgment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Obligation:** The Villaflors are obligated to pay Bernal Php1,710,271.21 for unpaid construction costs.
*   **Interest:** The key issue is the applicable interest rate and the date from which it should be reckoned. The CA applied 6% from the date of finality of judgment.
*   **Attorney's Fees:**  The award of Php200,000.00 in attorney's fees to Bernal was affirmed.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Villaflors are liable for the principal amount of Php1,710,271.21 plus interest.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** The primary point of contention is the interest calculation. Bernal argued for 6% from the date of extrajudicial or judicial demand (1998), and 12% from the date of judgment until full payment. The Supreme Court disagreed with Bernal and sided with the CA, modifying the ruling, interest of 6% per annum from the date of the Court of Appeals Decision's promulgation on February 14, 2014, until full payment
*   **Uncertainty of Amount Due:** The court emphasized that the original demand did not equate to a loan or forbearance of money but pertains to the cost of construction and services, the amount of which has not yet been determined with certainty even up to the time of the complaint's filing with the RTC. The uncertainty brought about by the numerous change orders that happened while the subject Medical Arts Building was being constructed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1169, Civil Code:** Referenced regarding when interest begins to run from judicial or extrajudicial demand.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals:**  Used as precedent for determining the proper awards of interest depending on whether the obligation is a loan/forbearance of money or other type of obligation.
*   **Nacar vs. Gallery Frames:** Cited regarding the change in the legal interest rate to 6% per annum (pursuant to BSP Circular No. 799).
*  **Republic of the Phils. vs. De Guzman:** Used in opposition as interest was reckoned from demand, because unlike in this case, the unpaid obligation in Republic was clear and uncontested even from the time that the extrajudicial demand was made.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the legal interest rate and its starting point remains the central contentious issue. The court clarified that the 6% interest rate applies from the date of the CA's decision (February 14, 2014), rejecting Bernal's claim for a higher rate and earlier start date.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petition, modifying the CA decision only to clarify that the 6% interest runs from the date of the CA's decision (February 14, 2014) until full payment. The court emphasized that the obligation wasn't a loan/forbearance of money, and the amount due was uncertain until the CA's quantification.  The case highlights the importance of clearly establishing and quantifying damages in construction disputes for purposes of interest calculations.
