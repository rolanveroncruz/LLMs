## Legal Document Summary: People v. Peromingan, G.R. No. 218401

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Appeal) reversing Court of Appeals and acquitting accused-appellant for violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Facts:** Accused-appellant was charged with illegal sale of 0.057 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu") based on a buy-bust operation. The RTC convicted her, and the CA affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation of Section 5, R.A. No. 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs.  Conviction requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of all elements, including the corpus delicti (the dangerous drug itself).
*   **Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 (as amended) & IRR:** Detailed procedures for the seizure, custody, and disposition of confiscated drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, and representatives from the National Prosecution Service *or* the media.
    *   Marking of seized items.
    *   Chain of custody documentation.
*   **Chain of Custody:**  Critical element in establishing corpus delicti and ensuring the integrity of evidence. Includes documentation of authorized movement and custody of seized drugs from seizure to presentation in court.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Lower courts relied heavily on this presumption regarding police officers' actions.
*   **Inadmissible Evidence:** Turn over receipt/inventory seized item was faulty by virtue of its being dated prior to the apprehension of the accused-appellant on July 1, 2008

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **State's Obligation:** To prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  This includes meticulously following procedures outlined in Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 and maintaining an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Police Obligations:** Strict adherence to the procedural safeguards in Section 21, R.A. 9165, to ensure proper handling and preservation of evidence.
*   **Accused's Rights:** The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Failure to Comply with Section 21:** The court emphasized the police officers' failure to comply with mandatory requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165. Notably, the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs were not conducted in the presence of the accused or her representative, or the required representatives from the media, DOJ, or an elected official. The documentation was also deficient.
*   **Broken Chain of Custody:**  Significant gaps in the chain of custody due to improper marking, inventory, and handling of the seized drugs. The lack of signature on the Inventory of Seized items.
*   **Undermining Integrity of Evidence:** The procedural lapses create reasonable doubt as to whether the substance presented in court was the same substance allegedly sold by the accused. This undermines the corpus delicti.
*   **Overreliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The Court found the lower courts' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty unwarranted, particularly given the demonstrable lapses in police procedure.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Primary statute violated (Sec. 5) and defining procedures for handling seized drugs (Sec. 21).
*   **People v. Calates, G.R. No. 214759, April 4, 2018:** Cited for the principle that in illegal sale of dangerous drugs, dangerous drugs are the corpus delicti and must be presented along with proof that there are no gaps in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Catalan, G.R. No. 189330, November 28, 2012, 686 SCRA 631, 646:** Cited for the principle that the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty could not be stronger or firmer than the presumption of innocence favoring the accused.

**Conclusion:**

The conviction was reversed due to significant procedural violations by the police officers, creating reasonable doubt as to the integrity and identity of the seized drug. The Court emphasized strict adherence to Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 and the accused's right to be presumed innocent, overriding the presumption of regularity in this particular case. The outcome highlights the critical importance of following proper procedures in drug-related prosecutions to protect the rights of the accused and ensure the integrity of the evidence.
