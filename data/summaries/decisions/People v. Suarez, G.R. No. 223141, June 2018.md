**Case Summary: *People v. Suarez*, G.R. No. 223141 (June 6, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  The Supreme Court *reversed* the conviction and acquitted the accused.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Section 5 (Illegal Sale) and Section 11 (Illegal Possession) of RA 9165:** Charges relate to the sale and possession of marijuana.
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165):**  The critical issue is whether the prosecution adequately established an unbroken chain of custody over the seized drugs. The SC found deficiencies.
*   **Marking of Seized Items:** Delay in marking and inconsistencies in the testimonies regarding the place of marking (scene vs. police station) raised doubts about the authenticity of the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Location of Inventory:** The buy-bust team brought the appellant to Police Station A instead of Police Station 5 which was the closest police station to the place of arrest.
*   **Turnover from Investigating Officer to Forensic Chemist:** Unexplained delay and missing custodial information from the night of inventory to laboratory submission.
*   **Improper Custody by Prosecutor's Office:**  Forensic Chemist's turnover of evidence to the Prosecutor's Office (specifically, a receiving clerk) *before* presentation to the court was a fatal break in the chain. *People v. De Guzman*, G.R. No. 219955, (Feb. 5, 2018) cited to emphasize the impropriety of the Prosecutor's Office holding custody before court presentation.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC held that lower courts erred in applying the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties due to patent irregularities in the police's handling of the evidence. *People v. Kamad*, 624 Phil. 289, 311 (2010).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing the *corpus delicti* and an unbroken chain of custody. The prosecution failed to adequately discharge this burden.
*   **Apprehending Team's Obligation:** Strict compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, including immediate marking, inventory, photographing, and proper turnover of seized items.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Saving Clause (Section 21, RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):** The SC emphasized that the saving clause (allowing non-compliance under justifiable grounds if integrity and evidentiary value are preserved) *only* applies if the prosecution explains the lapses *and* demonstrates that the evidence's integrity was preserved.  Here, they failed on both counts.
*   **Place of Inventory/Photograph:** The amendment allowing inventory at the nearest police station did not excuse the failure to explain why a more distant station was chosen.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Denoman*, 612 Phil. 1165 (2009): Emphasized the importance of preserving the identity and integrity of the seized drugs.
*   *People v. Bartolini*, 791 Phil. 626 (2016): Highlighted the critical importance of marking the seized item immediately.
*   *Derilo v. People*, 784 Phil. 679, 686 (2016) - Stresses that the dangerous drug itself constitutes the *corpus delicti*.
*   *People v. De Guzman*, G.R. No. 219955 (Feb. 5, 2018): The City Prosecutor's Office is not, nor has it ever been, a part of the chain of custody of seized dangerous drugs.
*   *People v. Kamad*, 624 Phil. 289, 311 (2010): The presumption of regularity cannot arise where the official acts are patently irregular.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted the accused due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody over the seized marijuana, which raised reasonable doubt about the authenticity and integrity of the evidence. The ruling underscores the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and the prosecution's burden to adequately explain any deviations from the prescribed procedure.
