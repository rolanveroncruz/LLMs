## Legal Document Summary: *Cesar B. Meris vs. Judge Carlos C. Ofilada* (A.M. No. RTJ-97-1390) & *Francisco R. Hernandez vs. Judge Carlos C. Ofilada* (A.M. No. RTJ-98-1411)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Judge Carlos C. Ofilada.  This involves two consolidated administrative matters (and references to prior complaints), ultimately resulting in his dismissal from service.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **A.M. No. RTJ-97-1390 (Meris Complaint):**  The Judge is faulted for prematurely quashing Search Warrant No. 20-M-96 for illegal possession of narra lumber [Sec. 68, PD 705 (Revised Forestry Code)].
    *   **Issue:**  Improperly granting the motion to quash ex parte, without proper notice to the complainant (EIIB) or the Special Counsel from the Department of Justice, violating procedural due process and Rule 15, Sections 5 & 6 of the Rules of Court.  The moving party advanced the hearing date but failed to properly notify the opposing parties.
    *   **Case Law:** Reliance on *Manakil v. Revilla* (42 Phil. 81 (1921)) highlighting the importance of proper notice and service. *People v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 93076, 23 July 1991, 199 SCRA 539) re: quashing search warrant
    *   **Ambiguity/Contentious Clauses:**  The interpretation and application of the exception under Sec. 6, Rule 15 (rights of adverse party not affected), which the Court held *does not* apply to motions to quash search warrants.  The Judge's rationale for quashing (legitimate enterprise, proper documents, lumber condition) was deemed insufficient to overcome the procedural defects.

*   **A.M. No. RTJ-98-1411 (Hernandez Complaint):**  The Judge is faulted for improperly granting bail and ultimately acquitting accused in a murder case (Crim. Case No. 1441-M-94).
    *   **Issue:** Granting a "Motion to Voluntarily Surrender the Accused with Motion to Bail" despite the accused being at large and the motion lacking proper notice of hearing.  The Court emphasized that bail is not available to an accused who has not voluntarily surrendered or been placed under legal custody.
    *   **Case Law:** *Manila Electric Company v. La Campana* (G.R. No. 97535. 4 August 199, 247 SCRA 77) regarding lack of notice making a motion worthless. Citing *Guillermo v. Reyes Jr.* (A.M. No. RTJ-93-1088, 18 January 1995, 240 SCRA 154) for the point about bail is unavailable.
    *   **Ambiguity/Contentious Clauses:**  The Judge's reliance on the public prosecutor's lack of objection and an affidavit of desistance. The Court held that a hearing and searching inquiry were still mandatory to determine the strength of evidence against the accused, and mere lack of objection does not suffice.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Ofilada:** Had a duty to ensure procedural due process, including proper notice of hearing on motions, adherence to the Rules of Court regarding bail applications (especially surrender/custody requirements), and conducting thorough inquiries before making decisions.
*   **Liability:** Found guilty of grave abuse of authority, evident partiality, gross incompetence, and ignorance of the law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Errors:**  The most significant risk identified is the Judge's failure to adhere to basic procedural rules regarding notice, service, and hearings.  This created a risk of violating due process rights and undermining the integrity of the judicial process.
*   **Bias/Partiality:** The "unseemly haste" in granting motions was seen as indicative of bias or partiality, potentially violating the judge's duty to act impartially.
*   **Prior Disciplinary Actions:**  The Court considered the Judge's history of prior administrative complaints (including *Santos v. Ofilada*, RTJ-94-1217) in determining the appropriate sanction. This highlights the risk of escalation for repeated misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

Judge Ofilada was dismissed from service due to a pattern of procedural errors, particularly concerning motions and bail applications, indicative of gross incompetence and a disregard for the Rules of Court. The Court emphasized the importance of upholding procedural due process and maintaining impartiality in judicial proceedings.
