Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Arturo Revita v. People*, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Arturo Revita "Alias" Arthur v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 177564, October 31, 2008.

**Holding:** Affirms the Court of Appeals' decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC's conviction of Arturo Revita for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Facts:**

*   Arturo Revita was charged with homicide for the shooting death of Flordeliza Caguioa.
*   The prosecution's case rested primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Bryan Caguioa, the victim's grandson. Bryan testified to seeing Revita shoot the victim with a "baby armalite."
*   The defense presented an alibi, claiming Revita was at his sister's house drinking and then sleeping at the time of the shooting. This alibi was supported by the testimony of relatives.
*   A paraffin test conducted on Revita was negative for gunpowder residue.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court emphasized the trial court's superior position in assessing witness credibility, citing *People v. Matito* and *People v. Castillo*.  The fact that the CA affirmed the RTC's findings strengthens the conviction, placing a heavy burden on the appellant to demonstrate manifest error. The Court found Bryan's testimony credible, straightforward, and without apparent motive to falsely accuse Revita, citing *People v. Continente* and *People v. Carillo*. The testimony of a single, credible witness is sufficient for conviction *People v. Camacho*.
*   **Alibi:** The Court deemed Revita's alibi weak and insufficient to overcome the positive identification of the accused by Bryan, citing *People v. Morales*. The Court emphasized the need to prove physical impossibility to be at the crime scene and that the alibi witnesses were relatives, diminishing its probative value *People v. Sumalinog, Jr*. The Court was not persuaded by the alibi, holding that it was possible for Arturo to have committed the crime and returned to his sister's house, which was only 300 meters away from the scene. Citing *People v. Appegu* as the foundation for establishing alibi defense.
*   **Paraffin Test:**  The Court gave little weight to the negative paraffin test results, citing the unreliability of the test and factors that could lead to a false negative. Citing *People v. Teehankee, Jr*
*   **Civil Liability:** The Court affirmed the award of actual damages (funeral expenses), civil indemnity, and moral damages, citing *Licyayo v. People*. The Court also awarded P50,000 for Civil Indemnity and P50,000 for moral damages based on jurisprudence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Single Witness:** The conviction relies heavily on the testimony of a single eyewitness.  While the court found Bryan credible, the lack of corroborating evidence beyond his testimony could be seen as a weakness.
*   **Negative Paraffin Test:** While the Court correctly downplays the significance of a negative paraffin test, defense counsel might argue that, in conjunction with the alibi, it supports a reasonable doubt.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence of Motive:** The decision doesn't discuss any potential motive for Revita to commit the crime. While not essential for a conviction, establishing motive strengthens the prosecution's case.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code (Homicide):** Defines and penalizes the crime.
*   **Article 64(1) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes the crime.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld Arturo Revita's conviction for homicide based primarily on the eyewitness testimony of the victim's grandson. The court found the witness credible, dismissed the alibi defense as weak, and deemed the negative paraffin test inconclusive. The decision reaffirms established principles regarding witness credibility, alibi, and the weight of scientific evidence. Defense Counsel's best bet for reconsideration may be to attack the credibility of the single witness by establishing reasonable doubt.
