**Case Summary: *Florete v. Florete*, G.R. No. 223321, April 2, 2018**

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the validity of a sale of shares in a close corporation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Paragraph 7 of Marsal & Co., Inc. (Marsal) Articles of Incorporation (AOI):** Stipulates a preemptive right for existing stockholders regarding the sale of shares. Requires written notice to the Board of Directors, notification to all stockholders, and a 10-day period for exercising the preemptive right.  Sales violating this are "null and void."
*   **Compromise Agreement and Deed of Assignment:**  Teresita Florete Menchavez's estate sold her 3,464 shares in Marsal to Rogelio Florete, Sr., as part of a larger settlement. This sale is the subject of the dispute.
*   **Section 97 & 98 of the Corporation Code:** Addresses the validity of restrictions on share transfer in close corporations; the court ruled that restrictions must appear in the articles of incorporation, the by-laws, and the stock certificate. If requirements are met, restrictions are enforceable.
*   **Section 99(5) of the Corporation Code:** Provides that even if the transfer of stocks is made in violation of the restrictions, such transfer is still valid if it has been consented to by all the stockholders of the close corporation.

**Obligations:**

*   **Selling Stockholder:** Obligated to provide written notice to the Board of Directors of intent to sell shares (per AOI Paragraph 7).
*   **Board of Directors:** Obligated to notify all stockholders of the offer to sell within 5 days of receiving notice from the selling stockholder.
*   **Existing Stockholders:** Possess a preemptive right to purchase the offered shares within 10 days of notice from the Board.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court of Appeals previously ruled that the sale by the Estate to Rogelio was null and void due to violation of the preemptive rights outlined in the AOI.
*   However, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, finding that the respondents/other stockholders consented to the sale as they were aware of the sale and did nothing to stop it for 17 years.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforceability of Transfer Restrictions:** The validity of the restriction hinges on its proper inclusion in the AOI, bylaws, and stock certificates. Failure to comply could render the restriction unenforceable.
*   **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Atty. Raul Muyco represented both Rogelio (the buyer) and Marsal, while also being the husband of respondent Ma. Elena. This presented a potential conflict and breached duty which was however not addressed by the court.
*   **Consent to Transfer of Shares:** If the stock is transferred in violation of qualifying conditions or restrictions on transfer, the consent of all the stockholders of the close corporation makes such transfer valid, and the corporation cannot refuse to register the transfer.
*   **Laches and Acquiescence:** Respondents inaction for 17 years despite knowledge of the sale was considered consent. The Supreme Court essentially ruled that the respondents were estopped from claiming a violation of preemptive rights due to their long delay and participation in proceedings where the sale was disclosed and implicitly approved.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68):** Secs. 97, 98, 99 directly address close corporations and restrictions on share transfers.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 129, Sec. 4:** addresses Judicial admissions, and that one who judicially admits cannot later challenge that fact.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Sale"**: The document does not explicitly define "sale" in relation to the transfer restrictions. This could be relevant if the transfer was characterized differently (e.g., donation, inheritance).

**Overall Legal Argument:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, and found that while the procedures outlined in Paragraph 7 of the AOI were not explicitly followed, there was substantial compliance, and the respondents had knowledge of and effectively consented to the sale.  This consent, under Section 99(5) of the Corporation Code, validated the transfer despite the procedural deficiencies. The court also noted that the respondentsâ€™ claim was barred by laches and estoppel because of their inaction for 17 years.
