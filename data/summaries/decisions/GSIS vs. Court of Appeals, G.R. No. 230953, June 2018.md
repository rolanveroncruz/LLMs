**Legal Document Summary: GSIS Board of Trustees vs. Court of Appeals and Demonteverde**

**Case Citation:** 833 Phil. 978 (G.R. No. 230953, June 20, 2018)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Government Service Insurance System Board of Trustees (GSIS BOT) and Cristina V. Astudillo
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals - Cebu City and Former Judge Ma. Lorna P. Demonteverde

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) acted with grave abuse of discretion in reinstating Demonteverde's Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus after it had previously dismissed it for being the wrong remedy.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) *granted* the GSIS BOT's petition, nullifying the CA's Resolutions and dismissing Demonteverde's Petition.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Retirement Benefits:** Demonteverde sought retirement benefits under R.A. No. 8291 for her government service outside the judiciary (NEA, DBP, PAO) and under R.A. 910 as amended by R.A. 9946 for service as Judge.
*   **GSIS BOT Decision:** GSIS BOT initially granted Demonteverde retirement under R.A. No. 8291 but later denied her Motion for Reconsideration regarding the accrual date, which she contended should be from age 60 rather than actual retirement date.
*   **Appeal Route:** The proper mode of appeal from GSIS BOT decisions is a petition for review under Rule 43, not a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.
*   **Accrual of Benefits:** The Supreme Court agreed with GSIS that the retirement benefits would accrue from the actual date of retirement and rejected Demonteverde's contention of accrual from the age of 60.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Demonteverde's Potential Liability:** The OCA indicated that if GSIS granted the additional benefits being sought, the Supreme Court may seek reimbursement from Demonteverde if the GSIS decided to grant additional retirement benefits under R.A. No. 8291.
*   **Potential Misinterpretation of R.A. 910:** The SC clarified that Demonteverde's non-judicial government service (NEA, DBP, PAO) was *already* creditable under R.A. No. 910, as amended by R.A. No. 9946, for the computation of her judicial retirement benefits. This effectively eliminates the need for separate retirement claims for each period of her government service.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Special civil action for certiorari; applicable only when there is no appeal or other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy.

*   ***Department of Education v. Cuanan,*** 594 Phil. 451, 459-460 (2008)
*   ***Madrigal Transport, Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation,*** 479 Phil. 768, 782 (2004)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accrual Date of Retirement Benefits:**  The main point of contention was whether Demonteverde's retirement benefits under R.A. 8291 should accrue from when she turned 60 while still actively employed, or from her actual retirement date. The Court affirmed it accrues from the date of retirement.
*    **Applicability of the exception to the general rule:** The Court determined that CA did not clearly and distinctly explain how it reached such conclusion that this case may be classified as an exception to the general rule that certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal

**Legal Analysis and Potential Issues:**

*   The SC correctly applied the principle that certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal, particularly where the loss was due to failure to comply with procedural rules (Rule 43).
*   Demonteverde's claim that she was denied due process lacks merit as she had multiple opportunities to be heard.
*   The SC highlighted the inappropriateness of filing separate retirement claims where non-judicial government service is already creditable under R.A. No. 910. This could inform future similar cases.
*   Potential issue of *res judicata* if Demonteverde attempts to re-litigate the issue of retirement benefits accrual date.
