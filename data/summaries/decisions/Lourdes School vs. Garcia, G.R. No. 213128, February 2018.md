## Legal Document Summary: Lourdes School Quezon City, Inc. vs. Luz V. Garcia (G.R. No. 213128)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the termination of Luz Garcia (Chief Accountant) by Lourdes School Quezon City, Inc. (LSQC) based on loss of trust and confidence due to alleged gross negligence in the oversupply of notebooks and irregularities in textbook sales.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision that Garcia's dismissal was illegal.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Garcia's Position:** Chief Accountant, Head of Accounting Office. Duty to protect the financial interests of the school.
*   **LSQC's Allegations:** Garcia's negligence led to:
    *   Oversupply of notebooks due to misleading information given to Fr. Ala.
    *   Irregularities in textbook sales, including theft facilitated by lack of control over Official Receipts (ORs).
    *   Divulging confidential information and tampering with witness statements.
*   **LSQC's Stated Just Cause:** Loss of trust and confidence, gross and habitual neglect of duty (Art. 282(c) of the Labor Code, now Art 297).

**Liabilities:**

*   **LSQC:** Liable for full backwages, separation pay in lieu of reinstatement (1 month salary per year of service), and attorney's fees (10% of monetary award) to Garcia. Case remanded to LA for computation.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The SC found a lack of substantial evidence directly linking Garcia to malicious intent or fraud in the oversupply of notebooks and textbook sales irregularities. LSQC's reliance on circumstantial evidence and vicarious liability (linking Garcia to Salas' actions) was insufficient.
*   **Disparate Treatment:** The SC highlighted the disparate treatment of Garcia compared to De Leon (who admitted guilt but was not dismissed) and Salas (who was exonerated), suggesting potential ill motive on LSQC's part.
*   **Definition of Gross Negligence:** The Court found that Garcia's negligence did not rise to the level of "gross negligence" sufficient to justify dismissal, citing lack of malicious intent and previous spotless record. The court highlights that Gross Negligence implies "a want or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence or the entire absence of care."
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** The SC emphasized that loss of trust and confidence must be based on a "willful breach" of duty, done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, not merely on carelessness or poor judgment. The breach must be supported by substantial evidence.
*   **Trust and Confidence as a Ground for Termination:** The Court reiterated that an employee's constitutional right to security of tenure should not be used as a subterfuge for causes which are illegal, improper, and unjustified.
*   **Impact of "Substantial Grounds" to Termination Cases:** In line with Article 282 (c) of the Labor Code, which highlights the need for a breach to rest on "substantial grounds," the Court argues that there must be an actual breach of duty committed by the employee which must be established by substantial evidence.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof rests on the employer (LSQC) to prove just cause for termination. The SC found that LSQC failed to meet this burden.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282(c) of the Labor Code (now Art 297):** Just cause for termination â€“ willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative.
*   **Lima Land, Inc., et al. v. Cuevas, 635 Phil. 36 (2010):**  Cited regarding the requirements for valid dismissal based on loss of trust and confidence, and the distinction between managerial and rank-and-file employees.
*   **Cebu Filveneer Corp. v. NLRC, 350 Phil. 197, 205 (1998):**  Cited regarding the definition of "gross negligence."
*   The Court also cites several cases regarding the need for a balance between employer interests and employee security of tenure.

**Conclusion:**

The case serves as a reminder that terminations based on loss of trust and confidence, especially for managerial employees, must be supported by substantial evidence of willful breach of duty. Employers cannot rely solely on suspicion or speculation, and must demonstrate a genuine and justified loss of trust. A spotless performance record can be a strong mitigant to the most penal of administrative punishments. The decision emphasizes the importance of due process, fairness, and proportionality in disciplinary actions, particularly concerning the employee's right to security of tenure.
