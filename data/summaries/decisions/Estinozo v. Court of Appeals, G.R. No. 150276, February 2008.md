**Case Summary: *Estinozo v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 150276 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the CA decision affirming RTC conviction for seven counts of Estafa under Article 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** Petitioner Estinozo, misrepresented herself as a recruiter for Golden Overseas Employment and collected placement fees from complainants promising overseas employment.  Complainants were never deployed, and Estinozo failed to refund their money, leading to estafa charges. RTC found her guilty; CA affirmed. Petitioner's counsel filed a Motion for Extension of Time to file Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the CA.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 315(2)(a), RPC:** Estafa through false pretenses. The prosecution has the burden to prove all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including (1) false pretenses or fraudulent representations, (2) reliance by the offended party, and (3) resulting damage.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirms the RTC's finding that the prosecution proved the elements of estafa beyond reasonable doubt, specifically highlighting the positive identification of Estinozo by the complainants and her admission of receiving the fees.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:**  Petitioner's right to seek reconsideration of the CA decision.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 45 and 65):**  Distinction between appeal by certiorari (Rule 45) and special civil action for certiorari (Rule 65).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Estinozo was found guilty of seven counts of Estafa, facing indeterminate penalties for each count (ranging from 2 years, 11 months, 10 days *prision correccional* to 6 years, 8 months, 20 days *prision mayor*).
*   **Civil Liability:**  Estinozo was ordered to reimburse complainants for the amounts defrauded, with legal interest from the filing of the informations.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Issues:**  The court emphasized the impropriety of filing a Rule 65 petition when appeal under Rule 45 was available, effectively waiving petitioner's right to appeal. *This raises a crucial point of whether counsel's procedural mistake should be imputed to the client, especially in criminal cases affecting liberty.* Cites *Amatorio v. People* regarding negligence in seeking relief.
*   **Factual Dispute:** Petitioner argued insufficient evidence for four of the seven cases due to lack of direct testimony and cross-examination.  *This raises questions of due process and the strength of evidence in these particular cases*.
*   **Counsel's Negligence:**  Petitioner claimed her counsel's filing of a prohibited motion (Motion for Extension) prejudiced her right to appeal.  *This could potentially raise issues of ineffective assistance of counsel, although the court does not explicitly address this.*
*   **Finality of Judgment:** Because the Motion for Extension of Time was denied and no Motion for Reconsideration or Petition for Review filed within the original period, the CA's decision attained finality, depriving the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to review it on appeal.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 315(2)(a):**  Defines and penalizes Estafa.
*   **Rules of Court, Rules 45 and 65:**  Governs appeal by certiorari and special civil action for certiorari, respectively.
*   **Amatorio v. People, 445 Phil. 481 (2003):** Relief will not be granted to a party who seeks to be relieved from the effects of the judgment when the loss of the remedy at law was due to his own negligence, or to a mistaken mode of procedure.
*   **Heirs of Lourdes Potenciano Padilla v. Court of Appeals, 469 Phil. 196, 204 (2004)** A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is a limited form of review and a remedy of last recourse, which lies only where there is no appeal or plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
*   **Macawiag v. Balindong, G.R. No. 159210, September 20, 2006, 502 SCRA 454, 465** Certiorari cannot co-exist with an appeal or any other adequate remedy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether the petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel in light of her counselâ€™s failure to file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal.
*   The CA decision affirming the RTC in the other 4 counts where witnesses where not cross-examined.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari due to procedural error and lack of grave abuse of discretion by the CA. The decision highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules and the finality of judgments. The case might be re-examined under a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or denial of due process for 4 of the counts.
