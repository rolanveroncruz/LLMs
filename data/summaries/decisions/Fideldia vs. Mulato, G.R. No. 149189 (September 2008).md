## Legal Document Summary: *Fideldia vs. Spouses Mulato* (G.R. No. 149189)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals decision affirming RTC ruling that reversed MTC decision in an unlawful detainer case.

**Background:** Petra Fideldia (Petra) entered into a Conditional Deed of Sale with Spouses Songcuan for two lots (4-B and 4-C). Songcuans filed a specific performance suit (Civil Case No. 459-BG) which they won. During Petra's appeal, she donated Lot 4-B to Leticia Fideldia (Leticia) and Lot 4-C to Vilma Fideldia. The CA affirmed the RTC decision, and the Supreme Court denied Petra's petition. Subsequently, Vilma donated Lot 4-C to Leticia, making her the registered owner of both lots. Spouses Mulato were lessees of the property, initially paying rent to Petra. After the judgment in favor of Songcuans, they started paying rent to them instead. Leticia then filed an unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 922) against the Spouses Mulato when they refused to pay increased rent to her.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conditional Deed of Sale:** The core issue revolves around the interpretation and effect of this document executed by Petra in favor of the Songcuans. The courts found it to be a perfected contract of sale, leading to a transfer of ownership upon delivery despite it being named "Conditional Deed of Sale".
*   **Donation of Properties:** Petra's donation of the lots to her daughters during the pendency of her appeal in the specific performance case raises questions of fraudulent conveyance.
*   **Lease Agreement:** The unlawful detainer case hinges on the existence of a valid lease agreement between Leticia and the Spouses Mulato. The court found no proof of such an agreement.
*   **Obligation to Pay Rent:** The core of the unlawful detainer action is the alleged failure of the Spouses Mulato to pay rent to Leticia.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Leticia's Liability:** The court found that Leticia failed to prove the existence of a lease contract and her right to possess the property as a basis for the unlawful detainer action. The donations she invokes are questionable.
*   **Fraudulent Conveyance:** The donation of the properties to Leticia during litigation could be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance designed to avoid the judgment in favor of the Songcuans.
*   **Lis Pendens:** The existing notices of *lis pendens* annotated on the titles at the time of the donation bind Leticia to the outcome of the specific performance suit. Her title is therefore subject to the Songcuans' superior right.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Nature of Conditional Deed of Sale:** The central point of contention is whether the "Conditional Deed of Sale" was, in fact, a perfected sale that transferred ownership to the Songcuans.
*   **Leticia's Standing as Lessor:** The lack of a direct lease agreement between Leticia and the Spouses Mulato undermines her claim to possession and right to collect rent.
*   **Validity of Donations:** The timing of the donations, occurring during active litigation, casts doubt on their legitimacy and raises concerns about potential attempts to circumvent the court's judgment.

**Overall Analysis:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions denying Leticia's unlawful detainer action. The court focused on her failure to establish a valid lease agreement with the Spouses Mulato. The court also highlighted the questionable circumstances surrounding the donations, as well as the prior rights of the Songcuans based on the earlier specific performance judgment. The case demonstrates the importance of formally offering evidence and carefully considering the implications of pending litigation when transferring property.
