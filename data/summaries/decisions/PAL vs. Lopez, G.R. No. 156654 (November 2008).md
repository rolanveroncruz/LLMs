**Case Summary: Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Vicente Lopez, Jr., G.R. No. 156654, November 20, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's judgment holding PAL liable for damages arising from the downgrading of respondent Lopez's seat from business to economy class on a Bangkok-Manila flight.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Breach of Contract of Carriage:** Lopez sued PAL for breach of contract after his confirmed business class seat was downgraded.
*   **Negligence of PAL Employees:** The RTC and CA found PAL negligent based on admissions of PAL's booking personnel and check-in clerk who failed to properly verify Lopez's ticket despite the discrepancy between his ticket and the passenger manifest. This negligence resulted in the downgrading.
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded Lopez P100,000 in moral damages, P20,000 in exemplary damages, and P30,000 in attorney's fees. The CA affirmed.

**Obligations:**

*   **Extraordinary Diligence:**  As a common carrier, PAL has a duty to exercise extraordinary diligence for the safety and comfort of its passengers (Article 1733, Civil Code).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Moral Damages:**  Awarded for breach of contract where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith (Article 2220, Civil Code). The Court found PAL's negligence amounted to bad faith, based on existing jurisprudence.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded to set an example or correction for the public good, usually when fraud or bad faith are involved.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded due to Lopez being forced to litigate.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **PAL's Defenses:** PAL argued that the respondent's contributory negligence (failure to reconfirm) should prevent recovery and that the terms of the contract were open for negotiation on the date of the flight. The Court rejected these arguments, finding the issue of contributory negligence to be a new matter raised only on appeal.
*   **Interpretation of "Bad Faith":** PAL argued that "fraud" and "bad faith" in the context of moral damages for breach of contract requires wanton, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent conduct. The Court upheld that PAL's negligence amounted to fraud or bad faith per *Ortigas, Jr. v. Lufthansa German Airlines, 64 SCRA 610 (1975)*.
*   **Factual Questions:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the issues raised by PAL (agreement to downgrade, contributory negligence, absence of fraud/bad faith) were primarily factual questions, generally outside the scope of review under Rule 45.
*   **Corporate Rehabilitation:** PAL's corporate rehabilitation was a potential impediment, but the Court resumed the case after PAL exited rehabilitation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1733, Civil Code:** Duty of common carriers to exercise extraordinary diligence.
*   **Article 2220, Civil Code:** Basis for awarding moral damages in cases of breach of contract with fraud or bad faith.
*   **Ortigas, Jr. v. Lufthansa German Airlines, 64 SCRA 610 (1975):** Cited as precedent for holding that negligence by a common carrier leading to a passenger's failure to be accommodated in the contracted class constitutes bad faith.
*   **Mercury Drug Corporation v. Baking, G.R. No. 156037, May 25, 2007, 523 SCRA 184** This case cited shows that there is no hard and fast rule in determining what would be a fair and reasonable amount of moral damages
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, holding PAL liable for damages due to the negligence of its employees, which constituted bad faith, resulting in the downgrading of Lopez's seat. The case reinforces the high standard of care imposed on common carriers and the potential for significant liability for breaches resulting from negligence and bad faith. The decision underscores the limited scope of Supreme Court review of factual findings.
