**Case:** *Siga-an v. Villanueva*, G.R. No. 173227, January 19, 2009

**Summary:**

This case involves a complaint for sum of money filed by Villanueva (Respondent) against Siga-an (Petitioner) for overpayment of a loan due to the erroneous collection of interest. The RTC and CA ruled in favor of Villanueva, ordering Siga-an to refund the excess payment. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modifications.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** An oral loan agreement existed for P540,000 between Petitioner and Respondent.
*   **Interest:** No written agreement existed stipulating interest on the loan, as required by Article 1956 of the Civil Code. The court found respondent's testimony regarding the promissory note to be more credible.
*   **Solutio Indebiti:** The principle of solutio indebiti (Article 2154, Civil Code) applies because Respondent made payments exceeding the principal loan amount, due to mistaken payment of interest, which the Petitioner had no right to demand. Siga-an is obligated to return the undue payments.
*   **Damages:** Moral and exemplary damages were awarded to Villanueva due to Siga-an's oppressive conduct (threatening to block business transactions).

**Liabilities:**

*   Siga-an is liable to refund Villanueva the excess payments totaling P335,000.00 (reduced from lower court decision).
*   Siga-an is liable for moral damages of P150,000.00 (reduced from lower court decision).
*   Siga-an is liable for exemplary damages of P50,000.00.
*   Siga-an is liable for attorney's fees equivalent to 25% of P335,000.00.
*   Siga-an is liable for legal interest: 6% per annum from the date of extrajudicial demand (March 3, 1998) until the finality of the Supreme Court Decision; then 12% per annum from the finality of the decision until satisfaction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Absence of Written Agreement on Interest:** The primary risk stemmed from the lack of a written agreement stipulating interest, rendering its collection illegal under Article 1956 of the Civil Code.
*   **Promissory Note Validity:** The validity of the promissory note presented by Siga-an was contentious, as Villanueva claimed coercion. The court favored Villanueva's version of the facts.
*   **Quantification of Damages:** The initial amounts of moral damages were considered excessive and reduced by the Supreme Court.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1956, Civil Code:** Stipulates that no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.
*   **Article 2154, Civil Code:** Defines the principle of solutio indebiti - obligation to return something received when there's no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake.
*   **Article 2209, Civil Code:** Pertains to legal interest as indemnity for damages in case of delay in payment of a sum of money.
*   **Article 2212, Civil Code:**  Deals with interest due earning legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded.
*   **Article 2217, Civil Code:** Provides for recovery of moral damages.
*   **Article 2232, Civil Code:** Allows exemplary damages in quasi-contracts if the defendant acted oppressively.
