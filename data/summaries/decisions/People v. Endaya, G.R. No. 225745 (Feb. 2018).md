## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Endaya, Jr.* (G.R. No. 225745)

**Case Summary:** This is a criminal case appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) concerning Arsenio Endaya, Jr.'s conviction for Parricide (Art. 246, RPC) for the death of his wife, Jocelyn Quita-Endaya, and Homicide (Art. 249, RPC) for the death of his mother-in-law, Marietta Bukal-Quita. Endaya admitted to the killings but claimed self-defense. The SC affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, finding him guilty of both crimes.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Parricide (wife) and Homicide (mother-in-law).  Informations alleged treachery and evident premeditation, although these were not ultimately proven and did not factor in the SC ruling.
*   **Defense:** Self-defense.  Endaya testified that he acted in self-defense after being attacked with a bolo by his wife's son (De Torres) when he went to convince his wife to come home.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The SC rejected the self-defense claim.  The prosecution was able to prove Endaya stabbed his wife and her mother. The Court ruled there was no Unlawful Aggression and the means employed were not reasonable or necessary to avert it as defined in case law, such as *Flores v. People*. The anatomical sketch did not support his account of the injuries suffered. The multiple stab wounds inflicted on the victims further negate his claim.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:** Voluntary surrender.  This was considered in determining the penalty for Homicide.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Parricide:** Reclusion Perpetua + accessory penalties.
    *   **Homicide:** Indeterminate sentence of 6 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* (minimum) to 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* (maximum).  The CA correctly modified the RTC's erroneous application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law to reflect a minimum period of *reclusion temporal* after considering voluntary surrender.
*   **Civil Liabilities:**
    *   Heirs were awarded a total of Php450,000 representing Loss of earning capacity and Php80,000 representing expenses for the wake, funeral, and burial of the two deceased.
    *   **Parricide Victim (Wife):** Php 75,000 Civil Indemnity, Php 75,000 Moral Damages, Php 75,000 Exemplary Damages (increased by SC, *People v. Jugueta* cited).
    *   **Homicide Victim (Mother-in-law):** Php 75,000 Civil Indemnity, Php 50,000 Moral Damages.
*   **Interest:** 6% per annum on all monetary awards from finality of judgment until fully paid, referencing *People v. Combate*.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Weakness:** Endaya's inability to substantiate his self-defense claim with corroborating physical evidence (especially the anatomical sketch) proved fatal.  His testimony alone was insufficient.
*   **Inconsistent Testimony:** Discrepancies in the description of injuries and the nature of the attack undermined his credibility.
*   **Evident Premeditation/Treachery (Alleged but Not Proven):** While not proven, the original Informations alleged these aggravating circumstances. This could have led to a higher penalty (Death penalty) for parricide had they been proven.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 246, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Parricide
*   **Article 249, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Homicide
*   **Article 64, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Rules for application of penalties considering mitigating and aggravating circumstances.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** (Not explicitly cited, but the law behind the application of minimum to maximum penalty).

**Case Law References:**

*   *Sabay v. People*, *People v. Duavis*, *People v. Samson*, *People v. Roxas*, *Flores v. People*, *People v. Arnante*, *People v. Sevillano*, *People v. Lalog*, *People v. Jugueta*, *People v. Combate*.
    These were all cited in the ruling.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld Endaya's convictions, emphasizing the failure to establish unlawful aggression necessary for self-defense. The penalties and monetary awards were adjusted accordingly based on established jurisprudence. The main risk lies in the initial allegation of aggravating circumstances, but they were not proven in the end. The defense was weakened by inconsistency of the defense's testimony with the physical evidence.
