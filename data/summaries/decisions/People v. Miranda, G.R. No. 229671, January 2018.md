## Legal Document Summary: People v. Jovencito Miranda y Tigas, G.R. No. 229671

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Jovencito Miranda y Tigas (Miranda) for violations of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165, the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Miranda was charged with illegal sale and illegal possession of 0.02 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Prosecution alleged a buy-bust operation based on an informant's tip, leading to Miranda's arrest and seizure of shabu. Marked money was allegedly used.
*   **Chain of Custody:** After arrest, items were marked, inventoried, and photographed with Miranda and a Barangay Kagawad present. The items were then turned over to SPO1 Orsua, later returned to Encarnacion, and finally delivered to PSI Sahagun for testing.
*   **Miranda's Defense:** Miranda claimed he was illegally arrested and photographed with the sachets. He denied selling or possessing the drugs.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Miranda guilty beyond reasonable doubt on both charges, imposing life imprisonment and fines.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, asserting substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule.

**Key Issues on Appeal:**

*   Whether the CA erred in upholding Miranda's conviction.
*   Critical analysis centers on compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 regarding chain of custody.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Miranda.
*   **Chain of Custody Deficiencies:** SC found *unjustified deviations* from the prescribed chain of custody rule, specifically the *absence of representatives from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the media* during the inventory and photographing of the seized items as required by Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   The prosecution failed to offer any plausible explanation for the absence of these required witnesses.
*   The court emphasized that *strict compliance with the chain of custody rule is a matter of substantive law*, and the failure to comply raises serious doubts about the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs. The saving clause of RA 10640 does not apply, because there were no justifiable grounds provided for non-compliance.
*   The Court explicitly *overrules prior jurisprudence* (citing *People v. Sta. Maria*, *People v. Uy*, and *People v. Mendoza*) stating that challenges to chain of custody must be raised at the trial court level, asserting that an appeal in a criminal case throws the whole case open for review.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Non-Compliance:** The most significant risk to the prosecution's case was the failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, particularly the absence of DOJ and media representatives during the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:** The failure to provide any justifiable grounds for the non-compliance was fatal to the prosecution's case. The integrity and evidentiary value was thereby questioned.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 & 11 (illegal sale & possession). Section 21 (chain of custody requirements).
*   **RA 10640:** Amends Section 21 of RA 9165; provides for a "saving clause" for non-compliance if justifiable grounds are proven and the integrity of the evidence is preserved.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)**: Previously held challenges to the chain of custody must be made at the trial court level.
*   **People v. Sta. Maria, 545 Phil. 520 (2007):** Cited by CA in its now overruled assertion that challenges to the chain of custody must be raised at the trial court level.
*   **People v. Uy, 384 Phil. 70 (2000):** A case wherein it was cited that an objection to evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The prosecution has the *affirmative duty* to establish an unbroken chain of custody and provide justifiable grounds for any deviations.
*   Law enforcement agencies are obligated to strictly comply with the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Legal Precision & Ambiguity:**

*   The ruling emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases.
*   The ruling clarifies that failure to comply with the chain of custody rule, absent justifiable grounds, will result in the acquittal of the accused, even if the issue is raised for the first time on appeal.
*   The court's interpretation of the "saving clause" in RA 10640 is crucial, requiring the prosecution to *prove* justifiable grounds for non-compliance.
*   Prior precedent, such as *People v. Mendoza*, is expressly overruled to the extent that it held challenges to the chain of custody must be raised at the trial court level. This clarifies the role of the appellate court, even if challenges are raised there for the first time.
