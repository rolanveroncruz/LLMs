**Legal Document Summary: *Fajardo v. Court of Appeals***

**Case:** G.R. No. 157707, October 29, 2008 (591 Phil. 146)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's decision holding Petitioner Fajardo liable for damages arising from a vehicular accident. Original cases were four consolidated civil suits for damages and a criminal case against driver Dacasin for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Facts:** Vehicular accident involving Fajardo's truck (driven by Dacasin) and a jeep carrying the victims. The victims died.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Dacasin (driver) and Fajardo (owner) liable for damages in the civil cases, consolidated with the criminal case where Dacasin was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision with double costs against Petitioner and Dacasin.
*   **SC Ruling:** Dismissed the petition for lack of merit, affirming the CA decision.
*   **Basis for Liability:** Based on circumstantial evidence, including police investigation report, location of vehicles, presence of debris, skid marks, a gasoline receipt linking the truck to Fajardo, and the driver's conviction in the criminal case.  Dacasin admitted to hiding for four years.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Fajardo):** To pay damages as determined by the lower courts.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Fajardo):** Vicarious liability as the owner of the truck, even if he was not the driver at the time of the accident.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Execution of Judgment:** Respondent heirs can enforce the judgment for damages against Fajardo's assets.
*   **No Further Appeal:** This decision constitutes the final word on this case.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Special civil action for certiorari.  The Court stated the requirements for a valid petition for certiorari, noting that Grave abuse of discretion is the arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility.

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Appeal by certiorari to the Supreme Court.  The Court notes that the Petitioner should have availed of Rule 45 instead of Rule 65.

*   **Doctrine of Vicarious Liability:** Although not explicitly stated, Fajardo's liability as the owner stems from the principle of vicarious liability, where an employer is responsible for the negligent acts of their employee, the Court relied on Circumstantial Evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on circumstantial evidence is contentious as there were no eyewitnesses. Petitioner argued the lack of direct evidence.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Procedural missteps (failure to file a motion for reconsideration and improper choice of remedy - Rule 65 instead of Rule 45) were fatal to the petition.
*   Circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to establish liability in vehicular accident cases.
*   Owners of vehicles can be held vicariously liable for the negligence of their drivers.

**Next Steps (for Plaintiff/Respondent Heirs):**

*   Proceed with execution of the judgment to recover damages from Fajardo.
