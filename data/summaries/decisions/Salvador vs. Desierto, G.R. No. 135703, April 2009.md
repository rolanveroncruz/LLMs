**Legal Document Summary: Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans vs. Ombudsman Desierto, et al. (G.R. No. 135703)**

**Key Issue:** Whether the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion in dismissing the complaint filed by the Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans (Committee) against respondents for violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) related to loans granted to Golden Country Farms, Inc. (GCFI).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Alleged Violations:** Violation of Sec. 3(e) (causing undue injury/unwarranted benefit through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence) and Sec. 3(g) (entering into a manifestly and grossly disadvantageous contract on behalf of the Government) of RA 3019.
*   **Behest Loan Criteria:** The loans were allegedly undercollateralized, the borrower (GCFI) was undercapitalized, involved endorsement by high government officials, and GCFI stockholders were identified as cronies, deviation of use of loan proceeds from the purpose intended; Use of corporate layering; Non-feasibility of the project for which financing is being sought; and Extra-ordinary speed in which the loan release was made.
*   **Loans Involved:** Loans from the National Investment Development Corporation (NIDC) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to GCFI.
*   **Respondents' Roles:** Panfilo O. Domingo, Conrado S. Reyes, Zosimo C. Malabanan, Jose R. Tengco, Jr., Placido L. Mapa, Jr., and Verden C. Dangilan were officers/directors of NIDC/DBP. Armando T. Romualdez, Vilma S. Romualdez, Juan L. Syquian, and Alfredo T. Romualdez were stockholders/officers of GCFI.
*   **Ombudsman's Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint, citing insufficient evidence of damage to the government and prescription of the offenses.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, reversing and setting aside the Ombudsman's Resolution. The Court ORDERED the Ombudsman to file the necessary information against all respondents except Placido L. Mapa, Jr.
The court held that the Ombudsman gravely abused his discretion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Ombudsman is now obligated to file informations against Panfilo O. Domingo, Conrado S. Reyes, Zosimo C. Malabanan, Jose R. Tengco, Jr., Verden C. Dangilan, Armando T. Romualdez, Vilma S. Romualdez, Juan L. Syquian, and Alfredo T. Romualdez. These individuals are subject to criminal prosecution for violation of Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of RA 3019.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** While the Supreme Court found probable cause, the actual trial will determine the ultimate sufficiency of the evidence.
*   **Differing accounts of facts:** The differing accounts of whether GCFI was undercapitalized, and the subject loans undercollateralized must be resolved in a full-blown trial.
*   **Placido L. Mapa, Jr.:** Transactional immunity granted to Placido L. Mapa, Jr. due to his cooperation in other Marcos-related cases protects him from these charges. *Mapa, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 100295, April 26, 1994).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Sections 3(e) and 3(g).
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto:** Regarding the computation of the prescriptive period for offenses involving behest loans, the counting of the prescriptive period commenced from the discovery of the offenses in 1992 *Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto (375 Phil. 697 (1999))*
*   **People v. Pacificador:** Discusses the prescriptive periods for offenses under RA 3019, distinguishing between pre- and post-BP 195 offenses *People v. Pacificador, G.R. No. 139405, March 13, 2001, 354 SCRA 310.*
*   **Mapa, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan:** Affirms the transactional immunity granted to respondent Mapa.
*   **Rule 65:** Treated the petition for review as a petition for certiorari under Rule 65.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **Prescription:** The Court held that the prescriptive period should be counted from the discovery of the offense (in 1992) rather than the date of the loan transactions. This aligns with *Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans v. Hon. Desierto*.
*   **Ombudsman's Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Court found that the Ombudsman erroneously focused solely on the lack of injury due to the government takeover and failed to properly consider the pre-takeover transactions and potential violations of Section 3(g). The Court emphasized that probable cause only requires showing that a crime was more likely than not committed and that preliminary investigation is not meant for full evidence presentation, citing *Drilon v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 115825, July 5, 1996).
