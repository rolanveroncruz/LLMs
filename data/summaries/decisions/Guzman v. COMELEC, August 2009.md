## Legal Document Summary: *Guzman v. COMELEC, Ting, and Garcia*, G.R. No. 182380, August 28, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 assailing the COMELEC's dismissal of a criminal complaint for alleged violations of Section 261(v) and (w) of the Omnibus Election Code.

**Facts:**

*   During the 45-day election ban period before the May 9, 2004 election, Tuguegarao City Mayor Ting, authorized by the Sangguniang Panlungsod, purchased land to be used as a public cemetery.
*   City Treasurer Garcia issued a treasury warrant for payment.
*   Petitioner Guzman filed a complaint alleging violations of the Omnibus Election Code.
*   The COMELEC dismissed the complaint, finding that the land acquisition did not constitute "public works."

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 261(v) of the Omnibus Election Code:** Prohibits the release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds for *any and all kinds of public works* during the 45-day period before a regular election, with specific exceptions.
*   **Section 261(w) of the Omnibus Election Code:** Prohibits (a) undertaking the construction of any public works (subject to the same exceptions as 261(v)), **OR** (b) issuing, using, or availing of treasury warrants or any device undertaking future delivery of money, goods, or other things of value chargeable against public funds.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **granted** the petition and **reversed** the COMELEC ruling. While the Court agreed that the land acquisition *itself* did not constitute "public works" under Section 261(v), it held that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint in its entirety. The Court found probable cause that Section 261(w)(b) was violated.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of Section 261(w)(b):** Mayor Ting and Treasurer Garcia face criminal liability for issuing a treasury warrant during the prohibited period, *regardless* of whether it was for public works. The Court interprets Section 261(w) as two distinct prohibitions connected by the disjunctive "or."
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by COMELEC:** The Court found that the COMELEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reaching an erroneous result, justifying judicial intervention despite the COMELEC's broad discretion in election matters.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 261(v) and (w):** The core statutory provisions at issue. The Court construes the term "public works" and the application of Section 261(w) using principles of statutory interpretation (e.g., *ejusdem generis*).
*   **Local Government Code of 1991, Section 17:** Used to define "public works."
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Book IV, Title V, Chapter 1, Sec. 1:** Department of Public Works and Highways powers.
*   **Rule 64 and Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Govern certiorari petitions.
*   **Star Paper Corporation v. Espiritu, G.R. No. 154006, November 2, 2006, 506 SCRA 556, 564-565:** Exceptions to motion for reconsideration requirement
*   **Pagsibigan v. People, G. R. No. 163868, June 4, 2009:** Question of law versus question of fact.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Public Works":** The COMELEC's and petitioner's interpretation of "public works" under Section 261(v). Court provides further clarity.
*   **Interpretation of Section 261(w):** The Court clarifies that this section contains two distinct prohibitions separated by "or," such that a violation of (b) does not require a connection to "public works."

**Legal Advice & Next Steps:**

The COMELEC is ordered to file criminal information against Mayor Ting and Treasurer Garcia. Defense counsel should focus on challenging the elements of Section 261(w)(b) based on fact and potentially arguing that the Court's interpretation is overly broad or not what the legislator had in mind when drafting the statute. Given the strong language in the decision, the COMELEC likely has little discretion but to prosecute.
