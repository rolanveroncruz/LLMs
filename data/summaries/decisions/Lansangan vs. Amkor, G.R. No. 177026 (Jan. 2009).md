**Legal Document Summary: *Lunesa O. Lansangan and Rocita Cendaña vs. Amkor Technology Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 177026**

**Case Summary:** This case involves a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by Lunesa Lansangan and Rocita Cendaña (Petitioners) against Amkor Technology Philippines, Inc. (Respondent). The Petitioners were terminated for “stealing company time” after an internal investigation triggered by an anonymous email. They admitted to the offense, which the Labor Arbiter (LA) characterized as "dishonesty" justifying dismissal under Article 282 of the Labor Code.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Just Cause for Termination (Art. 282, Labor Code):** The central issue is whether the Petitioners' misconduct (swiping ID cards) constitutes just cause for termination under Article 282 of the Labor Code (Serious Misconduct/Breach of Trust).
*   **Finality of Factual Findings:** The LA found Petitioners guilty of dishonesty, and *they did not appeal this finding*. This factual finding became final, impacting subsequent rulings.
*   **Reinstatement Order and Backwages:** The LA initially ordered reinstatement without backwages, a form of "equitable and compassionate relief" due to their previously clean records. The Respondent appealed the reinstatement order.
*   **NLRC Decision:** The NLRC granted the Respondent's appeal, deleting the reinstatement order.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA) Decision:** The CA affirmed the finding of misconduct but ordered the Respondent to pay backwages from the date of the LA's decision until the date of the NLRC's decision, relying on Article 223 of the Labor Code and *Roquero v. Philippine Airlines*.
*   **Supreme Court (SC) Decision:** The SC *denied* the petition, finding that the CA erred in awarding backwages. Because the original finding of just cause for termination was *not appealed*, the petitioners are not entitled to backwages, and *Roquero* and Art. 223 are not applicable.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation to Demonstrate Just Cause:** Respondent had the initial burden to prove just cause for the dismissal.
*   **Employee's Obligation to Appeal Unfavorable Findings:** The Petitioners' failure to appeal the LA's finding of dishonesty proved fatal to their case.
*   **Backwages Liability (Potential but ultimately overturned):**  Initially, the CA imposed a backwages liability on Respondent for the period between the LA's reinstatement order and the NLRC's reversal, relying on Roquero and Art 223. The SC reversed this finding.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Severity of Penalty vs. Offense:** While not explicitly raised by the SC given the procedural history, there is an implicit question of proportionality. Is dismissal too harsh for swiping an ID card? However, the petitioners' failure to appeal the dishonesty finding made this point moot.
*   **Application of *Roquero* and Art. 223:** The CA incorrectly applied *Roquero* and Article 223, which apply to situations where the employee is illegally dismissed. The SC clarified that these provisions are inapplicable when the termination is for a valid reason.
*   **Impact of Anonymous Tip:** The initial investigation was based on an anonymous email. While legally permissible, relying solely on such information without diligent verification could be a risk factor.
*   **Ambiguity of the offense**: Although the Supreme Court upheld the NLRC ruling, it did not specifically evaluate if the petitioners' "stealing of company time" was a valid reason for termination, since the labor arbiter's decision was not appealed.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282, Labor Code:** Just causes for termination (Serious Misconduct, Breach of Trust).
*   **Article 223, Labor Code:** Executory nature of reinstatement orders pending appeal.
*   **Article 279:** Reinstatement and backwages for unjust dismissal
*   ***Roquero v. Philippine Airlines***: This case was cited by the CA for awarding backwages pending appeal of a reinstatement order, but the SC distinguished it.
*   ***Agabon v. NLRC*** - Reiterates backwages and other benefits are justified only if the employee was unjustly dismissed.

**Conclusion:**

The finality of the LA's finding that the Petitioners committed dishonesty which justified dismissal significantly weakened their case. The SC correctly reversed the CA's backwages order, as Article 223 and *Roquero* are inapplicable where the dismissal is for just cause and that decision becomes final and unappealable. This case underscores the importance of appealing adverse factual findings in labor disputes.
