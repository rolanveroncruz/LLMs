## Legal Document Summary: *Philam Life v. Soriano* (G.R. No. 240320)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's reversal of the RTC's dismissal of Romeo Soriano's (insured) claims for accident insurance proceeds from multiple insurers, including Philam Life. The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA decision, directing Philam Life, along with the co-appellee insurance companies, to pay jointly and severally Romeo and Maria Luisa Soriano (spouses) for actual damages, insurance proceeds, and exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Accident Insurance Policies:** Romeo Soriano held multiple accident insurance policies, including two from Philam Life (W443343 and W443344).
*   **Coverage for Loss of Sight:**  The policies covered permanent and irrecoverable loss of sight.
*   **Duty to Pay:** SC affirmed the CA's decision directing Philam Life, along with the co-appellee insurance companies, to pay insurance proceeds to spouses Soriano.
*   **Payment of Damages:** SC directed Philam Life, along with the co-appellee insurance companies, to pay actual damages (medical reimbursements).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** The SC imposed exemplary damages of PHP 50,000.00 on Philam Life due to the company's deliberate delay and protracted litigation.
*   **Interest Rates:** Awards carry interest: 12% per annum from November 7, 2001, until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment.  A further 6% per annum legal interest accrues on the total monetary award from the finality of the SC decision until full satisfaction.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philam Life (along with co-appellee insurance companies):** Joint and several liability for actual damages, insurance proceeds. Philam Life has sole liability for exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Equipoise Rule:**  The RTC erroneously applied the equipoise rule, which was overturned by the CA and affirmed by the SC. The SC found that the evidence of spouses Soriano preponderated over that of the insurance companies.
*   **"Self-Serving" Testimony:**  Philam Life argued the Sorianos' testimonies were self-serving. The SC countered that in-court declarations, subject to cross-examination, are not considered self-serving.  *BJDC Construction v. Lanuza, 730 Phil. 240, 259 (2014)*.
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** Philam Life relied on Dr. Valenton's medical opinion (based on Dr. Villanueva's findings) to contradict the claim. The SC gave more weight to Dr. Villanueva's testimony, as he personally examined Romeo on the day of the accident.
*   **Unreasonable Delay:** The SC highlighted the insurer's "deliberate delay in the payment of insurance proceeds and protracted litigation," leading to the award of exemplary damages. This signals a potential for similar findings in other cases involving unreasonable claim denials. *Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corporation v. Aban, 715 Phil. 404, 419 (2013)*; *Loyola Life Plans Incorporated v. ATR Professional Life Assurance Corporation, 879 Phil. 695 (2020)*.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:**  The SC reiterated that insurance contracts are contracts of adhesion, construed liberally in favor of the insured. *The Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. v. Khu, 784 Phil. 703, 715 (2016)*.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits SC jurisdiction to errors of law.
*   **Rule 133, Revised Rules on Evidence:** Defines preponderance of evidence.
*   **Spouses Zapanta v. Rustan Commercial Corporation, G.R. No. 248063, September 15, 2021:** Discusses preponderance of evidence and the equipoise doctrine.
*   **Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corp. v. Tan, 877 Phil. 225, 230 (2020):** Exception to the Rule 45 on conflicting factual findings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document does not highlight any ambiguous or contentious clauses *within the insurance policies themselves*. The contention stems from the factual determination of whether the injury was accidental and the insurer's subsequent actions.

**End Result**

The decision is unfavorable for Philam Life and sends a strong message against unreasonable denial and delay in insurance claim settlements. It reinforces the principle of construing insurance contracts liberally in favor of the insured.
