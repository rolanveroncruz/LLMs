**Legal Document Summary: *Radiowealth Finance Company, Inc. vs. Alfonso O. Pineda, Jr., and Josephine C. Pineda***

**Case:** G.R. No. 227147, July 30, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for sum of money and damages.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan & Promissory Note:** Radiowealth Finance (Plaintiff) extended a loan of P557,808.00 to Pineda (Defendants) evidenced by a Promissory Note, secured by a Chattel Mortgage on the Defendant's vehicle. The Promissory Note contains a clause stipulating exclusive venue.
*   **Default & Demand:** Defendants defaulted, leading to a demand for the outstanding balance of P510,132.00.
*   **RTC Filing & Replevin:** Plaintiff filed suit for sum of money and damages with application for Writ of Replevin in RTC San Mateo, Rizal, alleging a branch presence there. RTC initially issued Writ of Replevin.
*   **RTC Dismissal:** RTC *motu proprio* recalled the Writ and dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, citing Plaintiff's principal place of business and Defendant's residence as being outside its jurisdiction.

**Issue:** Did the RTC err in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?

**Ruling:**

*   **Supreme Court Held:** RTC erred in dismissing the case. Petition GRANTED. Amended Order and Order of the RTC REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Civil Case No. 2814-15 SM REINSTATED and REMANDED to the RTC for further proceedings.

**Legal Analysis & Key Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdiction vs. Venue:** The RTC confused jurisdiction with venue. Jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution and law, determined by allegations in the complaint and character of relief sought. Venue is the place of trial.
*   **Jurisdiction Proper:** Based on BP 129, Section 19(8) as amended by RA 7691, the RTC had jurisdiction over the subject matter, given the amount in controversy exceeded jurisdictional threshold.
*   **Venue Clause Interpretation:** The Promissory Note's venue clause ("exclusively be brought in the proper court within [the] National Capital Judicial Region or in any place where Radiowealth Finance Company, Inc. has a branch/office, a[t] its sole option") is restrictive, limiting venue to NCR or locations where Radiowealth has a branch.
*   **Allegation of Branch:** Plaintiff alleged a branch in San Mateo, Rizal.
*   **Waiver of Improper Venue:** Even if venue was improper, the RTC cannot *motu proprio* dismiss the case. Improper venue must be objected to at the earliest opportunity; otherwise, it is deemed waived. (*Radiowealth Finance Company, Inc. v. Nolasco* applied).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **BP 129, Section 19(8) (as amended by RA 7691, Section 5):** Determines jurisdictional amounts for RTC.
*   **Rule 4, Rules of Court:** Governs venue of actions.
*   ***Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation v. Royal Ferry Services, Inc.*** Distinguishes jurisdiction from venue.
*   ***Briones v. Court of Appeals***: Interprets restrictive venue stipulations.
*   ***Radiowealth Finance Company, Inc. v. Nolasco***: Reiterates that a court cannot *motu proprio* dismiss a case for improper venue.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Branch Presence:** The outcome hinges on Radiowealth's ability to prove the existence of a branch in San Mateo, Rizal. The Court assumes this as a "standing allegation" absent dispute/rebuttal, but the RTC needs to factually determine this. If no branch exists, the restrictive venue clause might invalidate the RTC filing.
*   **Clarity of Venue Clause:** While deemed restrictive by the court, the drafting of the clause could be scrutinized.
*   **Defendants failure to object:** The case turned on the defendant's failure to object to venue at the earliest opportunity. If there was a valid argument against jurisdiction/venue raised earlier, the outcome may have been different.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court correctly reinstated the case based on the RTC's erroneous confusion of jurisdiction and venue, the restrictive venue clause and the defendant's failure to object. However, proving Radiowealth's branch presence in San Mateo remains critical for the continuation of the case in that venue.
