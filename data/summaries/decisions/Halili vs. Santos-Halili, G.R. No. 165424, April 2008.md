## Legal Document Summary: *Halili v. Santos-Halili*, G.R. No. 165424 (2008)

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision reversing RTC's grant of annulment.

**Issue:** Whether the totality of evidence sufficiently proved Petitioner's psychological incapacity to fulfill essential marital obligations under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Holding:** Petition denied; CA decision affirmed. The Supreme Court held that Petitioner failed to meet the burden of proving psychological incapacity.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Psychological Incapacity (Art. 36, Family Code):** The core issue is the application of this article. The Court applies the *Republic v. CA and Molina* (335 Phil. 664 (1997)) guidelines, emphasizing the need for proof of gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability. The Court notes that difficulty, refusal or neglect in performing marital obligations is insufficient.
*   **Evidence:** Petitioner relied on his testimony and a psychological report by Dr. Dayan, concluding Petitioner suffered from a mixed personality disorder stemming from a dysfunctional family.
*   **Court's Critique of Evidence:** The Court found the evidence established immaturity but failed to prove gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability as required by *Molina*. The psychological report's conclusion on gravity and incurability was deemed a mere statement without sufficient factual basis. The evidence only showed marital difficulties and conflicting personalities.
*   **Living Arrangements:** The fact that the parties never lived together was deemed insufficient proof of psychological incapacity, considering their student status and potential economic constraints. The court acknowledged that the relationship continued after the marriage ceremony.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterates that the burden of proof lies with the Petitioner seeking the declaration of nullity based on psychological incapacity (citing *Antonio v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 155800).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner had the obligation to prove psychological incapacity with clear and convincing evidence. He failed to do so.
*   Petitioner is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of Psychological Incapacity:** The application of Article 36 remains subjective and fact-dependent, leading to inconsistent rulings. *Halili* reinforces the strict interpretation established in *Molina*, making it difficult to secure annulments based on psychological incapacity.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The Court's skepticism towards the psychologist's conclusions underscores the need for thorough and well-supported expert testimony demonstrating the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the psychological disorder. A conclusory report is insufficient.
*   **Marital Difficulties vs. Incapacity:** The line between irreconcilable differences and psychological incapacity remains blurred. *Halili* suggests a high threshold for establishing the latter, requiring proof of a disabling factor inherent in the personality structure.
