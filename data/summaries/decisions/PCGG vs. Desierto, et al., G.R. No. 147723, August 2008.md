**Case:** *Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans vs. Hon. Aniano Desierto, et al.* G.R. No. 147723, August 22, 2008.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Ombudsman's dismissal of a criminal complaint against officers of Midland Cement Corporation (Midland Cement) and members of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) Board of Governors for alleged violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) related to behest loans.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Details:** Midland Cement obtained a USD 18.5M loan from DBP in 1968, secured by assets, mining claims, and stock pledges. DBP later became the majority shareholder of Midland Cement by 1981.
*   **Ad Hoc Committee & Allegations:** The Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans investigated and alleged that the loans were "behest" in nature, citing undercollateralization, undercapitalization, violation of the loan agreement (side agreement with Fives Lille-Cail), and cronyism.
*   **Ombudsman's Rulings:** The Ombudsman initially found probable cause to believe that R.A. 3019 was violated but dismissed the case due to prescription. Later, after respondent Reyes submitted a counter-affidavit, the Ombudsman dismissed the complaint for insufficiency of evidence.
*   **Accused Parties:** Four of the accused parties (Licaros, De Ocampo, Virata and Reyes) were members of the DBP Board of Governors while the remaining four (Lourdes Montenegro, Serafin Montenegro, Basilio Lirag and Felix Lirag) were officers and principal stockholders of Midland Cement.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The primary focus is on potential criminal liability under Section 3(e) (causing undue injury to the government) and 3(g) (entering into a grossly disadvantageous contract) of R.A. 3019.
*   The court also discussed the legal mandates of DBP in providing credit for the rehabilitation, development, and expansion of agriculture and industry as well as the broadening and diversification of the national economy.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** Initially cited as grounds for dismissal, though ultimately deemed immaterial as the Ombudsman found insufficient evidence. The Court noted that prescription starts from the discovery of the offense, likely after the creation of the Ad Hoc Committee.
*   **Proof of Elements of R.A. 3019 Violations:** The prosecution needed to prove elements such as undue injury, unwarranted benefits, manifest partiality, bad faith, gross negligence, and gross disadvantage to the government.
*   **DBP's Takeover of Midland Cement:** DBP's assumption of ownership of Midland Cement significantly changed the relationship between the entities, potentially affecting liability for post-takeover transactions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e) and (g):** The core statute under scrutiny, defining the prohibited acts.
*   **Administrative Order No. 13 (1992) and Memorandum Order No. 61 (1992):** Created and defined the powers of the Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans.
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee v. Hon. Desierto, 375 Phil. 697 (1999):** Established that prescription is reckoned from the time of discovery of the offense.
*   **Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Hon. Desierto, 400 Phil. 1368 (2000):** Establishes a policy of non-interference in the Ombudsman's exercise of investigating and prosecutory powers absent good and compelling reasons.
*   **Valencia v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 141336, 29 June 2004, 433 SCRA 88, 96:** Lays out the elements needed to prove offenses for violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. Act No. 3019.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Behest Loan":** The application of the eight-point criteria for "behest loans" was debated.
*   **Sufficiency of Collateral:** The adequacy of the collateral provided by Midland Cement was a point of contention.
*   **Good Faith:** The court emphasized that mere bad business judgment does not equate to criminal liability; a deliberate intent to unlawfully favor private entities needs to be proven.

**Conclusion:**

The court deferred to the Ombudsman's assessment that there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for violations of R.A. 3019. The Ombudsman's decision was largely influenced by the counter-affidavit of respondent Reyes and the changed circumstances following DBP's acquisition of Midland Cement. This is consistent with established jurisprudence regarding the discretion of the Ombudsman and the necessity of proving deliberate intent for criminal liability in behest loan cases.
