## Legal Document Summary: Kenneth Santos v. People of the Philippines (G.R. No. 232950)

**Case:** *Kenneth Santos y Italig v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 232950, August 13, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed RTC conviction for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the conviction, considering alleged illegal warrantless arrest and non-compliance with chain of custody requirements under RA 9165.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *partly meritorious* and *GRANTS* the appeal, *REVERSING* and *SETTING ASIDE* the CA decision. The Petitioner is *ACQUITTED*.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** The Court held the warrantless arrest *VALID* because the Petitioner was committing a crime *in flagrante delicto*. The police officers observed the petitioner holding a plastic sachet containing marijuana. This falls under Section 5(a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Despite the valid arrest, the Court *acquits* the accused because of *non-compliance* with Section 21 of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).
    *   **Specific Deviations:**
        *   No photographs were taken of the seized items during the inventory.
        *   No representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), nor an elected public official was present during the inventory, as mandated by Section 21 of RA 9165.
        *   The Prosecution presented no justifiable grounds for failing to comply with requirements.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, specifically Section 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) and Section 21 (Chain of Custody).
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to RA 9165, effectively codifying the IRR of Section 21 into statutory law.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 113, Section 5:** Lawful Warrantless Arrest
*   **People v. Simon, 234 Phil. 555 (1994):** Cited by the CA to determine the correct penalty based on the weight of the seized drug (overruled by subsequent jurisprudence).
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasized the importance of the presence of media and DOJ representatives to prevent "switching, 'planting' or contamination" of evidence.
*   **People v. Go, 457 Phil. 885 (2003)** reiterates the need to protect individual rights even for the basest criminals.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018** re-emphasizes the prosecution's duty to prove compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Invalidation of Evidence:** Failure to strictly adhere to Section 21, RA 9165, can lead to the suppression of evidence, resulting in acquittal, as seen in this case. The prosecution bears the heavy burden of proving compliance.
*   **Civil Liability:** While not explicitly discussed, potential liability for illegal arrest/detention may arise if the arrest were found invalid (though the Court validated the arrest *in flagrante delicto*).
*   **Professional/Administrative Liability:** Law enforcement officers may face administrative sanctions for procedural lapses in handling evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" for Non-Compliance:** This phrase in Section 21 allows for flexibility but requires the prosecution to *prove* the existence of such justifiable grounds. This presents a significant evidentiary burden. The Court specifically noted the failure to offer any "practicable reasons" for not following the proper procedure.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the strict requirements of Section 21, RA 9165 regarding chain of custody. While a valid *in flagrante delicto* arrest can establish probable cause, it is insufficient to secure a conviction without demonstrating meticulous compliance with the chain of custody rules. The Prosecution's failure to justify the absence of mandatory witnesses and photographic documentation, and the lack of clear reasons for non-compliance led to the acquittal. This case emphasizes the paramount importance of adherence to due process and the protection of constitutional rights even in drug-related offenses.
