Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Helen A. Paez vs. Atty. Alfonso D. Debuque* (A.C. No. 13628, May 28, 2024)

**Subject:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Debuque for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) and the Lawyer's Oath, stemming from a real estate transaction with his client, Paez.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Transaction:** Paez, while incarcerated, sought to sell property to Atty. Debuque to prevent foreclosure. Multiple deeds of sale were executed, with conflicting terms regarding the purchase price and who would pay taxes, creating factual disputes.
*   **Conflicting Deeds:** Three deeds of sale exist with different purchase prices:
    *   Deed 1: PHP 500,000 (PHP 300,000 to bank, PHP 200,000 to Paez).
    *   Deed 2 & 3: PHP 300,000 to Paez; Paez pays taxes.
*   **Paez's Claim:** Atty. Debuque failed to pay the full agreed-upon price. She disputes the validity of the first deed.
*   **Atty. Debuque's Defense:** Claims full payment via installments to Paez's sister (attorney-in-fact). Admits advising on a second deed to avoid tax penalties. Conflicting statements on the amount and method of payment.
*   **IBP Findings:** Investigating Commissioner found Atty. Debuque liable for violating Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the CPR. IBP Board of Governors increased the penalty to a three-year suspension, finding undue advantage of Paez's situation.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   **CPRA Application:** The Court applies the CPRA retroactively, holding Atty. Debuque liable under Canon II, Sections 1, 2, 5, and 11, citing *Manalang v. Atty. Buendia* and *Saladaga v. Atty. Astorga* regarding ethical conduct, honesty, and deceit.
*   **Violations:** Atty. Debuque engaged in unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct, making false representations. He advised tax evasion, and submitted contradictory statements.
*   **Sanction:** Three-year suspension from the practice of law, effective immediately upon receipt of the decision.
*   **Civil Liability:** The Court reiterated that it cannot order the lawyer to return money to complainant if he or she acted in a private capacity, citing *Lim v. Atty. Mandagan.* Paez's remedy for any unpaid purchase price is a separate civil action.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Debuque is obligated to adhere to the standards of legal proficiency, morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.
*   Suspension from practice for three years for violation of CPRA.
*   Potential civil liability to Paez for any unpaid balance of the property purchase price.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** Conflicting versions of the agreement, payment history, and the purpose behind multiple deeds creates complexities. The admissibility of evidence such as payment receipts will be crucial.
*   **Tax Evasion:** Atty. Debuque admitted to advising a scheme to avoid tax penalties. This admission could potentially expose him and Paez to tax liabilities and criminal charges.
*   **Burden of Proof:** In a separate civil action, Paez will bear the burden of proving the amount owed by Atty. Debuque with clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Retroactive Application of CPRA:** While the court allowed the retroactive application of the CPRA, the issue of feasibility and injustice was considered.
*   **Definition of 'Private Capacity' in civil liability:** The scope of the term 'private capacity' may need to be examined if there's a direct link between the real estate transaction and Atty. Debuque's legal representation of Paez.

**Statutory References:**

*   Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA), specifically Canon II, Sections 1, 2, 5, 11 and Canon VI Sections 33,34,35,37.
*   Lawyer's Oath
