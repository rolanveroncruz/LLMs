## Legal Document Summary: People v. Venerable, G.R. No. 110110

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Inoferio Venerable of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The victim, Clara Angcon, alleged Venerable forcibly had sexual intercourse with her on August 11, 1991. The RTC found Venerable guilty, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering him to pay moral damages.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Victim Testimony:** The RTC relied heavily on the victim's testimony, finding it credible despite inconsistencies in minor details. The court cited precedent that errorless testimony is not expected from rape victims (People v. Cabel, G.R. No. 121508).
*   **Medico-legal Evidence:** The medico-legal examination by Dr. Besario, conducted 15 days after the alleged rape, found no lacerations or seminal fluid. However, the court dismissed this, citing the time lapse and precedent that medical examination is not indispensable for a rape conviction (People v. Cura, 240 SCRA 234).
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Venerable's alibi was deemed inconsistent and unreliable and therefore given no evidentiary weight and the defense witness was his sister-in-law.
*   **"Sweetheart Theory":** Venerable claimed a prior consensual relationship with the victim. The court rejected this theory as unsupported by evidence and implausible given the victim's marital status and the public humiliation of bringing a rape charge.
*   **Multiple Acts of Rape:** The Solicitor General argued that the evidence showed four separate acts of rape, but as the Information only charged one offense, only one conviction was allowed (People v. Joya, 227 SCRA 9).

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Venerable):** Convicted of rape and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Obligated to pay civil indemnity to the victim.
*   **State:** The Prosecution fulfilled its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Medical Examination:** The significant delay between the alleged rape and the medical examination weakens the corroborative value of the medico-legal report. However, the court dismisses this on grounds that the exam is non-indispensable.
*   **Reliance on Victim's Testimony:** While permissible under Philippine jurisprudence (People v. Tabao, 240 SCRA 758), reliance solely on the victim's testimony without strong corroborating evidence can be a point of contention, particularly in cases with potential motive for false accusation.
*   **Assessment of Credibility:** The appellate court largely defers to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, but this assessment can be subjective and open to challenge if the trial court disregarded relevant factors.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines the crime of rape.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision rests heavily on the victim's testimony, deemed credible by the RTC. The absence of definitive medical evidence and the "sweetheart theory" were insufficient to overcome the prosecution's case. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, increasing the civil indemnity. A possible avenue for future appeal would be a challenge to the credibility assessment of the victim's testimony, but it would be a difficult argument given the deference typically given to trial court findings on credibility.
