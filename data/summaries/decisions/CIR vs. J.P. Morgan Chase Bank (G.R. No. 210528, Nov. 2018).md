**Legal Document Summary: *Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. – Philippine Customer Care Center***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 210528, November 28, 2018, 844 Phil. 97

**Issue:** Whether income derived by PeopleSupport (Philippines), Inc. (PeopleSupport), a PEZA-registered Economic Zone IT (Export) Enterprise, from leasing physical plant space, infrastructure, and transmission facilities to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. – Philippine Customer Care Center (J.P. Morgan-Philippines) is related to PeopleSupport's registered activities and therefore exempt from withholding taxes under Republic Act No. 7916 (Special Economic Zone Act of 1995) and Executive Order No. 226 (Omnibus Investment Code of 1987).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and DENIED the claim for refund filed by J.P. Morgan-Philippines, holding that the leasing activity was *not* related to PeopleSupport's PEZA-registered activities (outsourced customer care and business process outsourcing services) and was thus subject to regular corporate income tax.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **PEZA Registration:** PeopleSupport is registered with PEZA as an Economic Zone IT (Export) Enterprise. Incentives granted apply *only* to registered operations. (Rule XIII, Section 5 of IRR of RA 7916)
*   **Income Tax Holiday (ITH):** PEZA-registered enterprises are entitled to ITH for a period of 4-6 years for income derived from registered activity
*   **Master Service Provider Agreement (Agreement):** PeopleSupport agreed to provide physical plant space, voice and data infrastructure, workstation infrastructure, and platform support to J.P. Morgan-Philippines.
*   **Withholding Tax:** J.P. Morgan-Philippines withheld and remitted creditable income taxes on payments to PeopleSupport, but subsequently reimbursed PeopleSupport claiming erroneous withholding due to PeopleSupport's ITH.
*   **PEZA Memorandum Circular No. 2005-032:** Tax treatment of foreign exchange gains, sales of production rejects/seconds, scrap, raw materials, packaging materials and other production supplies

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misinterpretation of Scope of Registered Activity:** Risk of narrowly interpreting the scope of PEZA-registered activities, leading to potential tax liabilities for income derived from related, but arguably distinct, activities.
*   **New Activity Approval:** Failure to obtain PEZA approval for new or additional product lines, even if related to registered activity.
*   **Burden of Proof:** J.P. Morgan-Philippines (as claimant) had the burden of proving PeopleSupport's registration as a "facility provider" *and* that the leased income was entitled to ITH, which it failed to do.
*   **Strict Construction Against Taxpayer:** Tax incentives are construed strictly against the taxpayer, requiring clear and unequivocal statutory basis for exemption.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7916 (Special Economic Zone Act of 1995):**  Governs fiscal incentives for businesses in ECOZONES.  Section 23 provides tax credits for exporters.
*   **EO 226 (Omnibus Investment Code of 1987):** Art. 39 outlines incentives to registered enterprises, including ITH.
*   **Villamor, Jr. v. Umale, 744 Phil. 31 (2014):**  Defines questions of law vs. questions of fact.
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 20-2002:** Tax treatment of income earned from unregistered activities by enterprises under BCDA and PEZA.
*   **PEZA Board Resolution No. 00-411:** Defines IT, IT enterprises, IT parks and buildings, and facilities-providers in connection with PEZA registration and availment of incentives.
*   **Department of Trade and Industry (DTI):**Definition of business process outsourcing

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "business process outsourcing services" and whether the leasing activity falls within that definition.  The Court distinguished between providing IT-enabled *services* versus providing IT *facilities/infrastructure*.
*   Scope of registrable activities for facilities providers vis-a-vis IT enterprises.
*   The extent to which "related" activities are covered by PEZA incentives absent specific PEZA approval for such activities.

**Recommendations:**

*   Carefully review the scope of registered activities with PEZA and obtain clarification or amendments as necessary to cover related activities.
*   Maintain meticulous records to distinguish income derived from registered versus unregistered activities.
*   Seek advance rulings from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on the taxability of novel or ambiguous transactions.
*   Consult with PEZA to obtain specific approvals for any new or additional product lines, even if seemingly related to existing registered activities.
