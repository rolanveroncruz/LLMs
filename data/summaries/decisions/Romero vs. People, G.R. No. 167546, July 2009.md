**Case Summary: Romero v. People, G.R. No. 167546 (2009)**

**Nature:** Resolution affirming the CA decision that upheld the RTC and MTC judgments finding Sonny Romero civilly liable despite his acquittal in a criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and multiple serious physical injuries with damage to property.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Civil Liability Despite Acquittal:** Petitioner is held civilly liable to the heirs of the deceased victims despite his acquittal in the criminal case. This liability stems from the negligence, established by preponderance of evidence, although not proven beyond a reasonable doubt (as required for criminal conviction). This is consistent with Art. 100 of the Revised Penal Code, which establishes that every person criminally liable is also civilly liable.
*   **Extent of Civil Liability:** The MTC ordered the petitioner to pay actual damages, civil indemnity for death, moral damages, temperate damages, and loss of earning capacity.
*   **Basis of Acquittal:** The acquittal was based on the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not on a finding that the act from which civil liability might arise did not exist. This crucial distinction maintains the civil liability.
*   **Determination of Driver:** The courts consistently found Jimmy Padua, and not Gerardo Breis, Sr., was driving the taxi at the time of the accident. The Supreme Court declined to re-examine this factual finding.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for damages to the heirs of the deceased and injured victims due to the accident caused by his negligence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** The respondents (heirs of the victims) can pursue legal means to enforce the monetary judgment against the petitioner, including execution of assets.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 100:**  Every person criminally liable is also civilly liable.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 111, Sec. 2:** Extinction of the penal action does not automatically extinguish the civil action.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 120, Sec. 2:** Judgment must state whether the evidence absolutely failed or merely failed beyond a reasonable doubt to prove guilt.
*   **Bautista v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 46025 (1992); Calalang v. IAC, G.R. No. 74613 (1991):** An acquittal does not extinguish civil liability unless the act from which the civil liability arises did not exist.
*   **Manantan v. CA, 403 Phil. 298 [2001]:** The civil liability remains to be *ex delicto*.
*   **United States v. Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265 (1911):** Every crime gives rise to criminal and civil actions.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity, if any, lies in the degree of negligence required for criminal versus civil liability in traffic accident cases. The court clarifies that a lesser degree of negligence (preponderance of evidence) suffices for civil liability, even if the higher standard (proof beyond a reasonable doubt) is not met for criminal conviction.

**Analysis:**

The decision is a straightforward application of the principle that acquittal in a criminal case does not automatically extinguish civil liability. The Court emphasizes the importance of the basis for the acquittal. The decision also clarifies that a separate civil action is unnecessary when the facts have been established in the criminal proceedings.
