## Legal Document Summary: *Postanes v. People*, G.R. No. 155850 (2008)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC) and Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Petitioner, Edgardo Postanes, for slight physical injuries under Article 266, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code. The case stems from a consolidated trial involving cross-complaints of slight physical injuries between Postanes and Remigio Pasion.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction for Slight Physical Injuries (Art. 266 RPC):** Postanes was found guilty of inflicting slight physical injuries on Pasion. The penalty imposed was imprisonment of twenty days.
*   **Medical Certificate Admissibility:** A central issue revolves around the admissibility and probative value of medical certificates submitted by both parties. The RTC and CA admitted Pasion's medical certificate (authenticated by records custodian) while rejecting Postanes' due to lack of authentication.
*   **Factual Findings and Credibility:** The CA gave substantial weight to the factual findings and credibility assessments made by the MeTC and RTC, particularly the finding that Postanes had a motive to attack Pasion.

**Obligations:**

*   **Postanes:** The obligation to serve the sentence for slight physical injuries and pay costs.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Postanes:** Criminal liability for slight physical injuries.
*   **Potential Civil Liability:** Although not explicitly stated, the facts suggest potential civil liability for damages related to the injuries inflicted on Pasion.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Conviction:** Given the Supreme Court's denial of the petition based on Rule 45, the conviction appears final, unless other grounds for extraordinary remedy exist.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Postanes' case was significantly weakened by his failure to properly authenticate his medical certificate, highlighting the importance of proper evidence presentation.
*   **Appellate Deference to Trial Court:** The Supreme Court and CA deferred to the lower courts' factual findings and credibility determinations, emphasizing the high bar for overturning these on appeal.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes slight physical injuries.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court, limiting review to questions of law.
*   **Evidence Rules on Authentication:** The case implicitly references the rules on authentication of documents (specifically medical certificates) to ensure admissibility and reliability.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Unequal Treatment of Evidence:** Postanes argued "grave abuse of discretion" due to the CA's allegedly inconsistent treatment of medical certificates.  However, the Court defended this decision by stating Pasion's medical certificate was authenticated by the record custodian.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court's decision affirms the lower courts' findings, emphasizing the importance of authenticating evidence and the general deference given to trial courts' credibility assessments. The case highlights the limitations of petitions for review on certiorari when factual issues are central to the dispute.
