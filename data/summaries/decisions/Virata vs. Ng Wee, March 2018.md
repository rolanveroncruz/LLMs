## Legal Document Summary: Virata v. Ng Wee

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 220926, 221058, 221109, 221135, 221218 (March 21, 2018)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court Decision.  Involves alleged corporate fraud and the piercing of the corporate veil.

**Key Issue:** Personal liability of directors and officers of Westmont Investment Corporation (Wincorp) for losses incurred by Alejandro Ng Wee due to an investment in Power Merge. The core issue is whether the Wincorp directors (Cua, Cualopings, Santos-Tan, Estrella) can be held jointly and solidarily liable with other individuals and Wincorp for Ng Wee's losses.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Credit Line Agreement & Side Agreements:** Wincorp extended a credit line to Power Merge. Side Agreements, unknown to Ng Wee, effectively exonerated Power Merge from liability on promissory notes issued to secure the credit line.
*   **Section 31 of the Corporation Code:** This section is central to the case, defining the liability of directors, trustees, or officers for unlawful acts, gross negligence, or bad faith in directing corporate affairs.  The court's application of this section is heavily contested.
*   **Fiduciary Duty:** Directors have a fiduciary duty to protect the assets of the corporation on behalf of its stakeholders. The court found a breach of this duty.
*   **Promissory Notes:** Power Merge issued promissory notes obliging itself to pay Wincorp the drawdown amount with interest upon maturity.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Wincorp:** Held liable for actionable fraud relating to the credit line extension to Power Merge and related Side Agreements.
*   **Luis Juan L. Virata (Controller of Power Merge):** Liable based on Power Merge's promissory notes, even as an accommodation party.
*   **Directors and Officers (Cua, Cualopings, Santos-Tan, Estrella, Reyes, Ong):** The court held these individuals jointly and severally liable with Wincorp and Virata for Ng Wee's investment losses, based on Section 31 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Power Merge:** Held liable to Ng Wee on the promissory notes issued.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The core risk is the piercing of the corporate veil and the imposition of personal liability on the directors.
*   **Establishment of Gross Negligence/Bad Faith:** The court's finding of gross negligence, if not fraud, relies heavily on circumstantial evidence surrounding the approval of Power Merge's credit line despite "warning signs" and the execution of Side Agreements.  The dissenting opinion argues the facts insufficient to establish these elements.
*   **Ratification of Side Agreements:** There's an ambiguity as to whether the Wincorp board ratified the Side Agreements and a high level of contention.
*   **Defense of Business Judgement Rule:** Directors attempted to shield themselves using the business judgement rule, however the doctrine cannot be applied because there was bad faith and gross negligence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 31 of the Corporation Code:** Defines the liabilities of directors, trustees, or officers.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Hydro Resources Contractors Corp***.: Articulates the separate juridical personality of a corporation and the principle of limited liability, contrasting with the concept of piercing the corporate veil.
*   ***Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corp. v. Morning Star Travel & Tours, Inc., et al***.: Defines "bad faith" in the context of corporate actions.
*   ***University of Mindanao, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas***:  Discusses implied ratification of corporate acts.
*   ***Board of Liquidators v. Heirs of Kalaw***: Corporate ratification of an unauthorized act relates back to the time of the act.

**Contentious Clauses & Points of Argument:**

*   **Justification for Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The dissenting opinion disputes whether the evidence presented rises to the level required to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability on the directors. Tijam argued there was no fraud, no "dishonest purpose or consciousness in doing such wrong."
*   **Authorization of Side Agreements:** The movant-directors argued that the Side Agreements were never authorized by the board of directors.
*   **Due Diligence:** Directors claimed due diligence, relying on screening committee approvals. The court found this insufficient, stating directors are more than "rubber stamps." The diligence requirement is the most contentious area.
*   **Causation:** The dissent subtly questions whether the *approval* of the credit line *caused* Ng Wee's damages given the intervening factor of Side Agreements, a point the majority glosses over.

**Overall:**

This resolution upholds the personal liability of Wincorp directors. The core issue is whether the directors acted with the requisite culpability (gross negligence or bad faith) under Section 31 of the Corporation Code. The dissent raises substantial arguments against finding such culpability and the propriety of piercing the corporate veil. This case presents significant risk for corporate directors who passively rely on subordinate approvals without independent verification, especially in high-value transactions with apparent red flags.
