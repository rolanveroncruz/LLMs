**Legal Document Summary: Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. vs. Eugenio Pe単afiel, G.R. No. 173976**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari regarding the validity of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Mortgage Deed:** Spouses Pe単afiel mortgaged two properties to Metrobank under Act No. 3135. The mortgage was amended several times to increase the loan amount.
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** The spouses defaulted, leading Metrobank to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   **Publication of Notice of Sale:** The Notice of Sale was published in "Maharlika Pilipinas" and posted in three conspicuous places in Mandaluyong City.
*   **Auction and Sale:** Metrobank was the sole bidder and acquired the properties.
*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:**  Governs notice requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure. Requires publication once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city where the property is situated.

**Obligations:**

*   **Metrobank:** Obligated to comply strictly with the notice requirements of Act No. 3135.
*   **Spouses Pe単afiel:** Obligated to repay the loan according to the mortgage terms.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank:** Could be liable for damages if the foreclosure sale is deemed invalid due to non-compliance with statutory requirements.
*   **Spouses Pe単afiel:** Remain liable for the debt if the foreclosure is invalidated, but regain ownership of their property absent other enforcement actions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Foreclosure:** The CA found the foreclosure invalid due to the lack of general circulation of "Maharlika Pilipinas" in Mandaluyong City, as mandated by Act No. 3135, Sec. 3. This puts Metrobank at risk of losing the acquired property without satisfying the debt.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The court highlights that the party alleging non-compliance with publication requirements has the burden of proving it.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:** Crucial statutory provision governing publication requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **P.D. No. 1079:** Court clarified that P.D. No. 1079 requirements were not imposed on the extrajudicial foreclosure conducted by the notary public. This is the law revising publication of judicial notices.
*   **Fortune Motors (Phils.) Inc. v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, 332 Phil. 844 (1996):** Cited for the principle that the newspaper must be in general circulation in the place where the properties are located.
*   **Olizon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 107075, September 1, 1994, 236 SCRA 148:** Emphasized the purpose of notice of sale to inform the public and prevent sacrifice of the property.
*   **Ruiz, et al. v. Sheriff of Manila, et al., 145 Phil. 111, 114 (1970):** Established the burden of proof on the party alleging non-compliance with publication.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Newspaper of General Circulation":** The core dispute hinges on whether "Maharlika Pilipinas" qualifies as a newspaper of general circulation in Mandaluyong City. The SC emphasized that newspaper must be available to the public in general, not just to a select few. The CA found that the testimony of the publisher, combined with lack of subscribers in Mandaluyong, implied limited availability to the public.
*   **Sufficiency of Affidavit of Publication:** The Court notes the absence of a specific declaration in the Affidavit of Publication that "Maharlika Pilipinas" circulated in Mandaluyong City. Prior case law required publisher affidavits to distinctly state circulation where property is located.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding the extrajudicial foreclosure sale invalid due to failure to comply with the publication requirements of Act No. 3135. The Court emphasized the necessity for the newspaper to be genuinely available to the general public in the location of the property, not just a select audience, to constitute general circulation. The accreditation by a Presiding Judge is not decisive of whether it is a newspaper of general circulation. The burden of proof of non-compliance rests on the respondent.
