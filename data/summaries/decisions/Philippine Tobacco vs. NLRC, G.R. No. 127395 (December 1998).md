## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing & Redrying Corporation v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 127395, December 10, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the NLRC's decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's order for petitioner to pay separation pay to two groups of seasonal workers.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 283 of the Labor Code:**  The central legal provision governing the case.  Deals with termination due to closure/cessation of operations.  Specifies separation pay obligations, differentiates between closures due to serious business losses and other reasons. Court clarifies Art. 283 applies to both complete and partial cessation of business operations.
*   **Separation Pay:** The core issue revolves around the entitlement to and computation of separation pay for seasonal employees following the closure of petitioner's Balintawak plant and transfer of operations.
*   **Notice Requirement (Art. 283):** Employer is obligated to provide written notice of closure to employees and DOLE at least one month prior to the intended date.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Failure to Prove Serious Business Losses:** Petitioner failed to provide sufficient and convincing evidence of "serious business losses" to justify non-payment of separation pay. The "recasted financial statements" were deemed illogical and misleading. The Court relies on *Somerville Stainless Steel Corporation v. NLRC* which establishes the standard for proving 'serious business losses'.
*   **Illegal Dismissal of "Lubat Group":** Refusal to rehire members of the Lubat group for the 1994 season constituted illegal dismissal. Seasonal workers are considered "on leave" during off-season, not separated from service (*Manila Hotel Company v. CIR*). *Mercado v. NLRC* is distinguished based on its unique facts where employees were project employees free to contract with others.
*   **Defective Notice to "Luris Group":** Despite one-month notice of closure, termination was effective immediately, violating Art. 283.

**Computation of Separation Pay:**

*   **Formula:** Average monthly pay during the last season worked * Â½ * number of years of service (fraction of at least six months considered one whole year).
*   **Rejection of Petitioner's Formula:** The petitioner's formula based on total number of days worked is rejected as unfair and inconsistent with Art. 283 and 284's provision that a fraction of at least six months shall be considered one whole year.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Calculating "Year of Service":**  The exact interpretation of "year of service" for seasonal workers could be contentious.  The decision uses a six-month rule, however, there are possible issues for seasonal work of shorter duration.
*   **Damages:** The Lubat group cannot recover damages or backwages because they did not appeal the NLRC's decision. This highlights the importance of cross-appeals.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Coca-Cola Bottlers (Phils.), Inc. v. NLRC:** Art. 283 applies to both complete and partial cessation of business operations.
*   **Somerville Stainless Steel Corporation v. NLRC:** Standard of proof required to justify retrenchment due to losses.
*   **Manila Hotel Company v. CIR:** Seasonal workers not separated during off-season.
*   **Mercado v. NLRC:** Project employees can be hired by other owners and are therefore separated from service.
*   **Gaco v. NLRC**: Affirms ruling in Manila Hotel.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 283:** Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel.
*   **Labor Code, Article 280:** Discusses regular employment vs project employment.
*   **RA 7641:** Retirement pay law (raised by complainants but not a central issue).

**Outcome:** The NLRC decision is affirmed with modification. Petitioner is liable for separation pay (computed as above) to both groups.
