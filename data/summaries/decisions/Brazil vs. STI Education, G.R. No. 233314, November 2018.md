## Legal Document Summary: *Luningning Z. Brazil, et al. vs. STI Education Ser. Group, Inc., et al.*

**Case:** *Luningning Z. Brazil, et al. vs. STI Education Ser. Group, Inc., et al.*, G.R. No. 233314, November 21, 2018 (843 Phil. 828)

**Nature:** Appeal from CA decision affirming NLRC resolution dismissing illegal dismissal claims of faculty members.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **2008 Manual of Regulations for Private Higher Education (MORPHE) & 1992 Revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools (MORPS):** Stipulate minimum academic qualifications (Master's Degree) for full-time faculty status at the tertiary level (Sections 35, 36, 44, 45, 117). Failure to meet these standards results in classification as part-time faculty.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 281:** Defines probationary employment, not exceeding 6 months (unless apprenticeship agreement). Also allows for termination for just cause or failure to qualify as a regular employee based on reasonable standards.
*   **Fixed-Term Employment:** The court applies the standards in *Brent School, Inc. v. Ronalda Zamora* (1990) to determine the validity of fixed-term contracts in this case.
*   **Security of Tenure:** Reaffirms the constitutional right to security of tenure but balances it with the right to quality education and qualification standards.

**Obligations:**

*   **Educational Institutions (STI):** Required to comply with MORPHE/MORPS academic qualification standards for faculty, particularly the Master's Degree requirement.
*   **Faculty Members:** Obligated to meet minimum academic qualifications prescribed by MORPHE/MORPS to attain and maintain full-time, probationary, or regular employment status.

**Liabilities:**

*   **STI (Potential, but not found in this case):** Potential liability for illegal dismissal if terminations are not compliant with labor laws and faculty employment status.
*   **Faculty Members (Potential):** Potential for contract non-renewal if minimum academic qualifications are not met.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misclassification of Faculty:** Incorrectly classifying faculty as regular employees when they do not meet MORPHE/MORPS qualifications creates potential liability upon termination.
*   **Reliance on Estoppel or Equity:** Claiming estoppel or equity on the part of the employer is insufficient to overcome explicit requirements of MORPHE/MORPS.
*   **Non-Compliance with MORPHE/MORPS:** Failure of educational institutions to adhere to MORPHE/MORPS creates risk of violating CHED regulations and potential government sanction.
*   **Fixed-Term Contracts:** Risk that fixed-term contracts could be re-characterized as regular employment if the requirements in Brent are not met.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution:** State policy to protect labor and right to security of tenure.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 281:** Probationary employment.
*   **1992 Revised Manual of Regulations for Private Schools (MORPS).**
*   **2008 Manual of Regulations for Private Higher Education (MORPHE).**

**Case Law References:**

*   ***University of the East, et al. v. Pepanio, et al.*** (702 Phil. 191 (2013)): Operation of educational institutions involves public interest.
*   ***Raymond A. Son, et al. v. University of Santo Tomas (UST), et al.*** (G.R. No. 211273, April 18, 2018): CBA provisions violating MORPHE/MORPS are null and void. Estoppel cannot operate to give effect to an illegal act.
*   ***Lacuesta v. Ateneo de Manila University*** (513 Phil. 329 (2005)): Requirements for a faculty teaching in the tertiary level to acquire permanent employment or security of tenure.
*   ***Yolanda M. Mercado v. AMA Computer College-Para√±aque City, Inc.*** (632 Phil. 228 (2010)): Supplementing the Labor Code with the 1992 MORPS with respect to the period of probation. Reconciled the conflict arising from the grant of a probationary status under a fixed-term employment.
*   ***De La Salle Araneta University, Inc. v. Dr. Eloisa G. Magdurulang*** (G. R. No. 224319, November 20, 2017): Counting the period served as a probationary employee for purposes of regularization, did not include appointments on a part-time basis even those that commenced prior to 2008 or the effectivity of the 2008 MORPHE.
*   ***Brent School, Inc. v. Ronalda Zamora*** (60 Phil. 747 (1990)): Validity of fixed-term employment contracts for teachers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Grant of Regular Status:** The document suggests an implied grant of regular status by STI, which is problematic given the lack of qualifications under MORPHE.
*   **Two-Year Compliance Program:** Whether the absence of the two-year compliance program addendum in the job offers constituted bad faith by STI. Court held STI not obligated to offer the compliance program.

**Summary Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the faculty members' illegal dismissal complaints. The Court emphasized that faculty members without the required Master's Degree could not attain regular status under MORPHE/MORPS, despite any perceived grant of such status by the employer. This case highlights the primacy of statutory requirements over estoppel or equity and reinforces the validity of fixed-term contracts for part-time faculty members.
