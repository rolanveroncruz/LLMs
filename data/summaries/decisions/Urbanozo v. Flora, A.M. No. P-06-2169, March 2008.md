## Summary of Urbanozo v. Flora, A.M. No. P-06-2169

**Nature:** Administrative case against Sheriff IV Crisanto T. Flora for gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct relating to the enforcement of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. 2841-R.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Failure to Enforce Writ & Timely Report:** Respondent received a writ of execution on February 20, 2001. He went to Cordon, Isabela once and failed to locate any property of the judgment debtors. He did *not* file a report to the court within 30 days, as required by Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court. His return was submitted only on May 27, 2005.
*   **Improper Handling of Funds:** Respondent demanded and received P5,000 from the complainant for expenses *without* prior court approval, failing to comply with Section 10, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court. No receipt was issued, and funds were never liquidated.
*   **Dubious Sheriff's Return:** The Sheriff’s return was dated June 15, 2001 but submitted to the issuing court only on May 27, 2005 creating reasonable doubt that the return was antedated as supported by certification of OIC clerk of court Balagtey.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Sheriff's duty under Rule 39, Section 14 to execute writs promptly and file timely reports (every 30 days) to the court regarding the status of execution.
*   Sheriff's duty under Section 10, Rule 141 to seek court approval for estimated expenses, deposit funds with the clerk of court, liquidate expenses, and refund unspent amounts.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for Gross Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct.
*   Obligation to return P5,000 to complainant Rogelio V. Urbanozo.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates timely reporting on writ execution status.
*   **Section 10, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court:** Governs handling of sheriff's expenses.
*   **Bilag-Rivera v. Flora, A.M. No. P-94-1008:** Prior administrative case against Respondent.
*   **Caguioa v. Flora, A.M. No. P-01-1480:** Prior administrative case against Respondent.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of the Sheriff's Return Date:** The dating of the sheriff's return is highly suspect. If the return was indeed falsified (antedated), it strengthens the "grave misconduct" charge. OIC clerk of court Balagtey’s Certification raised doubts on its validity.
*   **Excuse of Suspension:** The Respondent's attempt to use his suspension as justification for the delay is weak. The court highlights the considerable time he had *before* his suspension.

**Outcome:**

*   Respondent Crisanto T. Flora was found GUILTY of gross neglect of duty and grave misconduct and was DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and privileges, with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.
*   Ordered to return P5,000 to the complainant.
