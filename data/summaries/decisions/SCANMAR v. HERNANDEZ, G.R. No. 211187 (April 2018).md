**Case:** *SCANMAR MARITIME SERVICES, INC. AND CROWN SHIPMANAGEMENT, INC. VS. CELESTINO M. HERNANDEZ, JR.* G.R. No. 211187, April 16, 2018.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and NLRC decisions, dismissing the seafarer's (Hernandez) claim for permanent disability benefits. The Court held that Hernandez prematurely filed his complaint and failed to comply with the mandatory procedure outlined in the POEA-SEC regarding medical assessments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Section 20B(3)):** Outlines the procedure for claiming disability benefits, including mandatory post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within 3 days of repatriation. Entitles seafarer to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. Specifies the process for contesting the company physician's assessment through a third, jointly agreed-upon doctor whose decision is final and binding.
*   **Company-Designated Physician's Role:** Holds the primary responsibility for assessing the seafarer's disability.
*   **120/240-Day Rule:** The company has 120 days from repatriation to determine fitness to work and when the seafarer is deemed to be in a state of total and temporary disability. This period may be extended to 240 days if further medical treatment is required.
*   **Lack of Third Doctor Opinion:** Failure to seek a third doctor's opinion to resolve conflicting medical assessments (company doctor vs. seafarer's doctor) as prescribed by the POEA-SEC is detrimental to the seafarer's claim.

**Liabilities:**

*   The original LA and NLRC decisions found the petitioners liable for US$60,000 in disability benefits and US$6,000 in attorney's fees, which was REVERSED by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Premature Filing:** Filing a claim before the company-designated physician issues a final assessment, or before the 240-day period (if extended) lapses, is considered premature.
*   **Non-Compliance with POEA-SEC Procedure:** Failure to adhere to the mandated process of medical assessment and third doctor consultation weakens the seafarer's claim.
*   **Contradictory Medical Opinions:** The case highlights the importance of the company-designated physician's assessment and the need for a third doctor's opinion to resolve conflicting assessments between the company-designated physician and the seafarer's chosen physician. The court emphasized the seafarer's failure to comply with the procedure when he filed his complaint on July 20, 2010 without a definite assessment yet being rendered by the company-designated physician and, worse, sought an opinion from Dr. Pascual, an independent physician, on August 12, 2010 despite the absence of an assessment by the company-designated physician.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. (588 Phil. 895 (2008)):** Clarifies the application of the 120/240-day rule.
*   **C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Taok (691 Phil. 521 (2012)):** Enumerates conditions under which a seafarer can pursue an action for disability benefits.
*   **Quitoriano v. Jebsens Maritime, Inc. (624 Phil. 523 (2010)):** Distinguished as it applies to cases filed before the *Vergara* ruling. The court already delineated the effectivity of the Crystal Shipping and Vergara rulings in the case of Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar by enunciating that, if the maritime complaint was filed prior to October 6, 2008, the 120-day rule applies; but if the complaint was filed from October 6, 2008 onwards, the 240-day rule applies.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the importance of adhering to the procedures outlined in the POEA-SEC for claiming disability benefits. The failure to follow these procedures, especially regarding medical assessments and third-party consultation, can be fatal to the seafarer's claim. The timeliness of the claim and the assessment of the company-designated physician are crucial factors.
