## Legal Document Summary: Gambito v. Bacena, G.R. No. 225929 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC's reversal of MTC decision in a case for quieting of title, declaration of nullity of title, specific performance, and damages.

**Key Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Jose V. Gambito (Plaintiff in MTC, Appellant in RTC, Appellant in CA) - Claiming ownership via donation from his mother, derived from a deed of sale ultimately stemming from OCT No. R-578 (1916).
*   **Respondent:** Adrian Oscar Z. Bacena (Defendant in MTC, Appellee in RTC, Appellee in CA) - Claiming ownership via OCT No. P-21362 (1999), based on a patent title, derived through Petronila Castriciones' claim on Lot No. 1331, Cad 45.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** Concerns conflicting claims to a portion of land in La Torre South, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. Gambito seeks to quiet title based on a chain of ownership originating from a 1916 OCT. Bacena claims ownership based on a later patent title.
*   **Collateral vs. Direct Attack:** MTC initially deemed Bacena's challenge to Gambito's title a collateral attack (impermissible in an action to quiet title). RTC and CA correctly found it to be a direct attack, thus permissible.
*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** A critical point of contention is the validity of the Deed of Sale from Pascual and Covita to Gambito's mother (Luz). Bacena successfully argued that it was falsified, as the vendors were already deceased at the time of the alleged execution.
*   **Laches:**  Gambito argued Bacena's claim was barred by laches. The Court held that Bacena, in continuous and undisturbed possession, had no reason to doubt his ownership and therefore no reason to assert it earlier. Laches is applied against Gambito, not Bacena.
*   **Transferee in Good Faith:** The Court held that Gambito is not an innocent purchaser for value, as he acquired the property gratuitously by Deed of Donation. Section 53 of PD 1529, Property Registration Decree regarding fraud does not extend to donees of title that resulted from falsified documents.
*   **Priority of Title:**  Gambito unsuccessfully argued that the earlier OCT (1916) should prevail. Court held that OCT No. R-578 should not have included Lot No. 1331, given Castriciones' pre-existing claim.
*   **Damages:** The award of damages against Gambito was upheld. The Court referred to RTC which concluded that there was no good faith on the part of Gambito, given his knowledge of prior defects in the chain of title (notary public to Last Will and Testament).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Specifically Section 53, regarding the rights of innocent purchasers for value in cases of fraudulent registration.
*   **_Ingusan v. Heirs of Aureliano I. Reyes_, 558 Phil. 50 (2007):**  Cited for the principle that falsified documents, including deeds of donation, are null and void, rendering subsequent titles also void.
*   **_Heirs of Margarita Pabaus v. Heirs of Amanda Yutiamco_, 670 Phil. 151 (2011):** Cited for the principle that private ownership is not affected by a free patent issued over the same land.
*   Definition of Laches from _Pangasinan, et al. v. Disonglo-Almazora, et al._, 762 Phil. 492.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Falsified Deed:** The central risk for Gambito is the established invalidity of the Deed of Sale in the chain of title. This fundamentally undermines his claim.
*   **Award for Damages:** Gambito's liability for damages. His subjective "good faith" is questionable given the circumstances.
*   **Jurisdiction of the Bureau of Lands:**  A potential point, though not explicitly contentious, is the Court's finding that the Bureau of Lands had no jurisdiction to grant a public land application (free patent) over land already held as private property.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, effectively denying Gambito's claim to the property. The key factor is the falsified Deed of Sale, which renders his title void. The Court also rejected Gambito's arguments regarding laches and transferee in good faith. The court emphasized that private ownership is not affected by the later issuance of a free patent.
