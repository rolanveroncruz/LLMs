Here's a legal summary of the provided *Maranaw Hotels and Resort Corp. v. Court of Appeals* case:

**Case Summary: *Maranaw Hotels and Resort Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 149660, January 20, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals resolution that denied Maranaw Hotel's Petition of NLRC decision.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition due to lack of proper verification/certification against forum shopping and the determination of employer-employee relationship

**Facts:**

*   Sheryl Oabel was initially hired by Maranaw Hotel as an extra beverage attendant.
*   Maranaw Hotels subsequently contracted with Manila Resource Development Corp (MANRED).
*   Oabel was transferred to MANRED.
*   Oabel filed for regularization against Maranaw Hotels, later amended to illegal dismissal after she was terminated.
*   Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint.
*   NLRC reversed, finding MANRED a labor-only contractor, Maranaw Hotels the true employer, and Oabel illegally dismissed.
*   The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition of Maranaw on procedural grounds of non-compliance with the rule on certification against forum shopping.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' resolution and upholding the NLRC's substantive findings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 280 of the Labor Code:** Defines regular and casual employment.  The Court emphasized the provision regarding an employee who has rendered at least one year of service being considered a regular employee with respect to the activity.
*   **Doctrine of Labor-Only Contracting:** The Court found MANRED to be a labor-only contractor, based on:
    *   MANRED providing *personnel* rather than specific services
    *   MANRED's lack of sufficient capitalization and equipment.
    *   Maranaw Hotels controlling the tasks performed by Oabel.
    *   Activities performed being necessary or desirable in the hotel's business.
*   **Regular Employment:** Oabel, having worked for Maranaw Hotels for more than one year performing tasks necessary to the hotel's business, was deemed a regular employee.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The NLRC was correct in finding that her termination was not for just or authorized cause.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Maranaw Hotels and MANRED (Jointly and Severally):** Liable to Oabel for:
    *   Full backwages and benefits from August 1, 1998, until actual reinstatement.
    *   Salary differentials.
    *   Share in service charges.
    *   Service incentive leave pay.
    *   13th-month pay from July 20, 1995, to July 31, 1998.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misclassification of Employees:** Risk of misclassifying regular employees as project or casual employees to avoid benefits and security of tenure.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** Risk of engaging in illegal labor-only contracting arrangements to circumvent labor laws.
*   **Procedural Compliance:**  Strict adherence to procedural requirements like proper verification and certification against forum shopping is essential for judicial review. *BPI Leasing Corp. v. Court of Appeals* highlights the need for specific board resolutions authorizing representation.
*   **Damages for Illegal Dismissal:** Substantial financial exposure in the event of illegal dismissal findings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 280:** Defines regular and casual employment.
*   **Digital Microwave Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128550:** Addressed the issue of who is an authorized signatory for the certification against forum shopping but ultimately requires specific authorization.
*   **BPI Leasing Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127624:** Emphasized the need for a specific board resolution authorizing counsel to sign pleadings for a corporation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The characterization of MANRED's contract as a "service agreement" was challenged. The Court looked beyond the label to determine its true nature as labor-only contracting.
*   The employer attempted to argue Oabel's work was "per function" or "need basis" to avoid regularizing her.
