Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Manila International Airport Authority v. City of Pasay* G.R. No. 163072, April 2, 2009 (602 Phil. 160)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision upholding the City of Pasay's power to impose and collect real property taxes (RPT) on the NAIA Pasay properties of MIAA.

**Issue:** Are the NAIA Pasay properties of MIAA exempt from real property tax?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, setting aside the CA decision and declaring the NAIA Pasay properties exempt from RPT, except for portions leased to private parties.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Executive Order (EO) 903 (Revised MIAA Charter):** Established MIAA and transferred approximately 600 hectares of land, including NAIA, to MIAA (Sections 3 & 22).
*   **Local Government Code (LGC, RA 7160):**
    *   **Section 193 (Withdrawal of Tax Exemption Privileges):** Generally withdrew tax exemptions for GOCCs, except for specified entities.  Cited by the CA to negate MIAA's prior exemption.
    *   **Section 234 (Exemptions from Real Property Tax):** Exempts real property owned by the Republic or its political subdivisions, *except* when beneficial use is granted to a taxable person. Also, the last paragraph of Section 234 withdraws exemptions for GOCCs, unless otherwise provided within that section.
    *   **Section 133(o) (Common Limitations on Taxing Powers):** Prohibits LGUs from taxing the National Government, its agencies, and instrumentalities. *Central to the Supreme Court's decision.*
*   **Civil Code Article 420:** Defines properties of public dominion (e.g., ports, roads), which the Court equates with airport lands and buildings.

**Reasoning of the Supreme Court:**

1.  **MIAA is NOT a GOCC:** Relies heavily on the *MIAA v. Court of Appeals* (Parañaque case) precedent (G.R. No. 155650, July 20, 2006).  MIAA is classified as a government instrumentality vested with corporate powers, *not* a GOCC under Section 2(13) of the Administrative Code, because it's not organized as a stock or non-stock corporation.  It has no capital stock divided into shares and no members.
2.  **Exemption Under Section 133(o) LGC:** As a government instrumentality, MIAA falls under the protection of Section 133(o) of the LGC, which prohibits local taxation of national government instrumentalities.
3.  **Property of Public Dominion:** The NAIA lands and buildings are properties of public dominion under Civil Code Article 420, "intended for public use" (ports). Therefore, they are owned by the Republic and exempt under Section 234(a) of the LGC.
4.  **Exception to Exemption:** The exemption under Section 234(a) *does not* apply to portions of NAIA *leased* to taxable entities (private parties).

**Dissenting Opinions:**

*   **Ynares-Santiago, J.:**  Argues MIAA holds the properties only for the benefit of the Republic and therefore follows Section 234.
*   **Tinga, J.:**
    *   Criticizes the classification of MIAA as a "government instrumentality" as opposed to a GOCC, arguing it's a contrived distinction.
    *   Argues that Section 232, in relation to Section 234 of the LGC, makes GOCCs liable for real property taxes
    *   Maintains that if MIAA properties are deemed public dominion, the provisions allowing sale in the charter are invalid.
*   **Nachura, J.:**
    *   Argues that Section 234 is a specific provision that qualifies the Section 133, the general provision.
    *   Follows Section 234(a) and looks at ownership to determine taxability

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Contrived Distinction of "Instrumentality":** The distinction between "instrumentality" and "GOCC" remains contentious and could be challenged in future cases. The legal basis for this classification is tenuous, relying on a selective reading of the Administrative Code.
*   **Lease Agreements:** The extent and nature of lease agreements with private entities will require careful scrutiny to determine which portions of the NAIA properties are subject to RPT.  Ambiguity in lease terms could lead to disputes.
*   **Potential for Legislative Change:** Congress could amend the LGC to specifically tax government instrumentalities or redefine "government instrumentality" to align with the "GOCC" definition, overriding the court's interpretation.
*   **Future Application:**  The decision could create inconsistencies in the taxation of other government-owned properties and may require further judicial clarification. The ruling also creates a possible incentive for the government to use "instrumentalities" to avoid taxation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **MIAA v. Court of Appeals (Parañaque case):** G.R. No. 155650, July 20, 2006 (The pivotal precedent on MIAA's status as a government instrumentality).
*   **Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA) v. Marcos:**  330 Phil. 392 (1996) (Initially held airport authorities subject to RPT; partially overruled or distinguished by the *MIAA* case).
*   **Administrative Code of 1987:** Provides definitions of "government-owned or controlled corporation" and "instrumentality," which are central to the Court's analysis.
*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160):** Sections 133, 193, 232, and 234.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 420 (Properties of public dominion).
*   Executive Order 596
