Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Hilario P. Soriano v. Ombudsman Simeon V. Marcelo, et al.* (G.R. No. 160772, July 13, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65

**Facts:** Petitioner Soriano filed a complaint with the Ombudsman against Assistant City Prosecutor Balasbas for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).  The complaint stemmed from Balasbas' reopening of a case against Mely Palad, a bank examiner, for falsification of public documents. Soriano alleged that the reopening gave Palad unwarranted advantage, causing him undue injury. The Ombudsman dismissed Soriano's complaint, and the motion for reconsideration was denied.

**Issue:** Did the Ombudsman commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint against Balasbas?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition, affirming the Ombudsman's decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):**  The alleged violation. This section prohibits public officers from causing undue injury or granting unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.

*   **Rule 112, Section 4 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Provides procedures for resolving Investigating prosecutor, with the written approval of a superior, before filing a complaint or information.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of RA 3019, Section 3(e):**  Requires proof of (1) public officer status, (2) acting with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence, and (3) resulting undue injury or unwarranted benefit.

*   **Risk to Public Officers:**  The case highlights the risk of potential liability for actions taken even pursuant to superiors' directives. However, the court emphasized the presumption of good faith in the performance of official duties.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **First Corporation v. Former Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals:**  Certiorari is limited to errors of jurisdiction, not errors of judgment.

*   **Esquivel v. Ombudsman:** Courts generally defer to the Ombudsman's investigatory and prosecutorial powers.

*   **Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Desierto:** Affirmed the Ombudsman's independence and discretion in determining probable cause, but also acknowledged the court's ability to review for grave abuse of discretion.

*   **Albert v. Sandiganbayan:** Defined "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," and "gross inexcusable negligence" for purposes of RA 3019, Section 3(e).

*   **Collantes v. Marcelo:** Emphasized the presumption of good faith for public officers and the need for a showing of malice or gross negligence amounting to bad faith.

*   **Soriano v. Marcelo (G.R. No. 163017, 18 June 2008, 555 SCRA 85):** Related case involving the same petitioner and similar allegations against Dimagiba, which was also dismissed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core issue was whether Balasbas acted with the requisite *mens rea* (manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence) to be held liable under RA 3019, Section 3(e). The Court found he did not, focusing on his lack of control over the final decision and his initial objection to reopening the case.

**Summary of Reasoning:**

The SC held that certiorari was inappropriate because Soriano's arguments challenged the Ombudsman's *judgment* (evaluation of evidence), not its *jurisdiction*. The Court deferred to the Ombudsman's discretion in finding no probable cause. It emphasized the presumption of good faith on the part of public officers and the lack of evidence showing Balasbas acted with malice, bad faith, or gross negligence. Balasbas' actions were considered to be in compliance with directives from his superiors (Dimagiba and the City Prosecutor). The Court also found no "undue injury" to Soriano. Further supported that prior similar case was dismissed and that the public officer was acting in good faith.

**Potential Risks:**

The decision underscores the heavy burden on plaintiffs to prove the elements of RA 3019, Section 3(e), particularly the *mens rea* requirement. The principle of prosecutorial discretion grants substantial deference to the Ombudsman's decisions. Subordinate public officers must comply to directives, or risk insubordination.
