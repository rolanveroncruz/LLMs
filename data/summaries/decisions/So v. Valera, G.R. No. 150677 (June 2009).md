## Legal Document Summary: *Renato Reyes So v. Lorna Valera* (G.R. No. 150677)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on *certiorari* regarding the CA's reversal of the RTC's decision declaring a marriage null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity). The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Renato So sought nullity based on two grounds: (1) alleged lack of essential and formal requisites of marriage due to signing blank marriage documents, and (2) Lorna Valera's psychological incapacity. He presented his testimony and a psychological report from Dr. Gates.

*   **Respondent's Position:** Lorna Valera failed to appear or file an answer.

*   **RTC Ruling:** Initially, the RTC declared the marriage null and void based on Lorna's psychological incapacity at the time of marriage.

*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, stating the petitioner failed to prove Lorna's psychological incapacity, and that her flaws didn't constitute a psychological illness.

*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the CA. The SC found:
    *   No valid ruling or sufficient evidence existed regarding the lack of essential and formal requisites of marriage. The petitioner himself introduced the marriage contract as evidence.
    *   Petitioner failed to meet the burden of proof under Article 36 and the *Republic v. Molina* guidelines. Dr. Gates' psychological report was insufficiently in-depth, relied primarily on the petitioner's biased statements, and failed to adequately demonstrate the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the alleged incapacity. Specifically, the SC pointed out that Dr. Gates did not show that Lorna's behavioral disorder was medically or clinically permanent or incurable, nor that the disorder was grave enough to bring about the disability of the party to assume the essential obligations of marriage.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner bears the burden of proving the nullity of marriage.

*   **State's Role:** The State (through the Solicitor General) has an obligation to intervene and ensure that evidence is not fabricated.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Petitioner's Testimony:** The primary risk in the case was the over-reliance on the petitioner's testimony without sufficient corroboration or examination of the respondent.

*   **Psychological Evaluation:** The validity of the psychological evaluation and its conclusions were contentious, as it was based solely on the petitioner's account. The SC's opinion underscores the difficulty of establishing psychological incapacity when the respondent does not cooperate.

*   **Interpretation of Psychological Incapacity:** The case reinforces the strict interpretation of Article 36 and the high burden of proof required to establish psychological incapacity.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 36:** Psychological incapacity as a ground for nullity of marriage.
*   **Family Code, Articles 68-71, 220-221, 225:** Essential marital obligations.
*   **Constitution, Article XV:** Constitutional protection of marriage and the family.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 112019):** Defined the characteristics of psychological incapacity (gravity, juridical antecedence, incurability).
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals (Molina) (G.R. No. 108763):** Established definitive guidelines for interpreting and applying Article 36.
*   **Marcos v. Marcos (G.R. No. 136490):** Clarified that personal examination of the respondent is not a *sine qua non*.
*   **Navales v. Navales (G.R. No. 167523):** Differentiated "difficulty," "refusal," or "neglect" in performing marital obligations from psychological "incapacity."

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dr. Gates' Report:** The court found the psychologist's report disproportionate, with conclusions based on isolated incidents rather than continuing patterns, and the source of the facts slanted towards the petitioner.

**Legal Precision & Key Takeaways:**

This case highlights the high standard required to prove psychological incapacity under Philippine law. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive and objective evidence, going beyond the biased testimony of one spouse. It underscores the importance of meeting the *Molina* guidelines, particularly demonstrating the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the psychological condition. The case serves as a cautionary tale regarding the reliance on solely one-sided psychological evaluations. The SC explicitly states that falling out of love and mere unwillingness to fulfill marital obligations are insufficient grounds for nullity under Article 36.
