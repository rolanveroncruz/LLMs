**Subject:** Summary of A.M. No. P-24-150 (OCA IPI No. 13-4030-P) - Administrative Case against Sheriff Balading

**Case:** *Froilan E. Ignacio vs. Paul Christopher T. Balading*

**Court:** Supreme Court, En Banc

**Date:** July 30, 2024

**Issue:** Whether Sheriff Balading is guilty of grave abuse of authority for improper execution of a Writ.

**Holding:** Balading is found GUILTY of grave abuse of authority.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** *People v. Reyes* (Bouncing Checks Law/BP 22). Reyes acquitted but held civilly liable to Aznar.
*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued to satisfy Reyes's civil liability.
*   **Alleged Abuse of Authority:** Balading, accompanied by Aznar and "hatak boys," levied hardware materials from Megabuilt Enterprises, owned by Ignacio.
*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Balading did not properly identify himself, forced entry into Megabuilt, and levied goods worth PHP 500,000 from a business NOT owned by the judgment debtor (Reyes). Balading offered money to Reyes' househelp to obtain keys to her vehicles.
*   **Balading's Defense:** Claims Ignacio is Reyes's husband, and Reyes was hiding in Megabuilt. Sold levied items at public auction to satisfy judgment.
*   **Investigation Findings:** Executive Judge Lopena found grave abuse of authority because there was no proof Reyes had an ownership interest in Megabuilt. CCTV footage showed forcible removal of goods without proper identification or opportunity to contest the levy.
*   **Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) Report:** Affirmed grave abuse of authority. Balading did not present the Writ or prove the levied value matched the Writ.
*   **Penalty Imposed:** Due to Balading being previously dropped from the rolls for AWOL:
    *   Forfeiture of all benefits (excluding accrued leave credits).
    *   Fine of PHP 200,000 (payable within 30 days from finality of the Resolution; subject to contempt proceedings if unpaid, citing Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court).
    *   Disqualification from reinstatement/appointment to any public office.

**Obligations:**

*   Balading is obligated to pay PHP 200,000 within 30 days of the Resolution becoming final.
*   Failure to pay results in contempt proceedings.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for grave abuse of authority.
*   Potential criminal liability (as Ignacio filed a separate criminal complaint).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Points:**

*   **Accrued Leave Credits Exception:** The court reaffirms that accrued leave credits cannot be forfeited as they are considered earned remuneration. This point is specifically mentioned to comply with jurisprudence like *Dela Rama v. De Leon, 897 Phil. 561, 572 (2021)*.
*   **Lack of Due Process for Balading:** While the court proceeded despite Balading's unavailability, this could be a ground for appeal based on due process concerns, though likely unsuccessful given his AWOL status and the clear evidence.
*   **Enforcement of Fine:** Collection of the PHP 200,000 fine may be difficult if Balading has no assets or income.
*   **Amendment to Rule 140, Section 22:** The Court explicitly states its intention to amend Rule 140, Section 22 of the Rules of Court regarding the payment of fines, indicating a shift in policy.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Authority Definition:** Cited *Romero v. Villarosa, Jr., 663 Phil. 196, 207 (2011)*.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 9(a):** Defines sheriff's duties in executing judgments for money.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140, sec. 17 & 18 as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC:** outlines the sanctions available for serious charges.
*    **Civil Code, art. 1278:** defines when compensation takes place.
*   **Constitution, art. VIII, sec. 6:** Grants the Supreme Court administrative supervision over all courts.
*   **Dela Rama v. De Leon, 897 Phil. 561, 572 (2021) & Paredes v. Padua, 471 Phil. 31, 32 (2004):** re: entitlement to leave credits despite dismissal.
*   **Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:**  Basis for contempt proceedings for failure to pay the fine.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (BP 22):** The Bouncing Checks Law, which gave rise to the civil liability in the first place.
*   **A.M. No. 18-01-05-SC:** Amending Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.

**Analysis:**

The Court heavily emphasizes the Sheriff's duty to adhere to procedural and ethical standards when executing court orders. The decision reinforces the principle that a Writ cannot be enforced against a non-debtor's property. The heavy penalty reflects the gravity with which the court views abuse of authority by court officers.
