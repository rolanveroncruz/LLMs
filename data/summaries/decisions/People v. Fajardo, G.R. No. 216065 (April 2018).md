**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Arthur Fajardo y Mamalayan*, G.R. No. 216065, April 18, 2018

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Arthur Fajardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The victim, Tony Chua, was abducted and detained for 37 days, with a ransom demand of $3,000,000.00 made to his family.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 267, RPC:** Defines and penalizes Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention. Crucial elements include:
    *   Offender is a private individual.
    *   Kidnapping or detention occurs, depriving the victim of liberty.
    *   The act is illegal.
    *   Qualifying circumstances are present (detention exceeding three days, simulation of public authority, serious physical injuries, or victim is a minor/female/public officer) *or* the purpose is extortion.

*   **Conspiracy (Article 8, RPC):** Agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony and decide to commit it. Can be inferred from the coordinated acts of the accused demonstrating a joint purpose.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Fajardo is obligated to serve the sentence of *Reclusion Perpetua* for Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extrajudicial Confessions:** The defense challenged the admissibility of extrajudicial confessions by co-accused, arguing lack of continuous independent counsel. While the Court acknowledged this argument, it ultimately held that even without the confessions, sufficient direct evidence existed for conviction. This highlights the importance of challenging improperly obtained confessions under custodial investigation rules (Miranda doctrine as implemented in Philippine law).

*   **Conspiracy:** Fajardo argued a lack of evidence proving conspiracy. The Court found sufficient evidence based on the coordinated actions and joint purpose demonstrated during the abduction. *People v. Pepino*, 777 Phil. 29 (2016), cited for the principle that conspiracy can be inferred.

*   **Res Inter Alios Acta:** Fajardo invoked this rule to disclaim being bound by the extrajudicial confessions of his co-accused. However, since the conviction was supported by the victim's positive identification of Fajardo (direct evidence), this argument was rendered moot.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Niegas, 722 Phil. 301 (2013):** Elements of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention under Article 267, RPC.
*   **Macayan v. People, 756 Phil. 202 (2015):** Prosecution's burden to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **People v. Gabrino, 660 Phil. 485 (2011):** Deference to trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **People v. Abatayo, 477 Phil. 668 (2004):** Credibility of witnesses with no improper motives.
*   **People v. Ramos, 358 Phil. 261 (1998):** Ransom demand consummates Kidnapping/Serious Illegal Detention; actual payment is immaterial.
*   **Quidet v. People, 632 Phil. 1 (2010):** Conspiracy inferred from overt acts.
*   **People v. Pepino, 777 Phil. 29 (2016):** Conspiracy agreement need not be expressly proven.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 8:** Definition of Conspiracy
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 267:** Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention

**Conclusion:**

The conviction is primarily based on the victim's credible and consistent positive identification of Fajardo. The arguments regarding the admissibility of extrajudicial confessions were ultimately inconsequential given the strength of the direct evidence. The key risk area was the evidence for conspiracy but the court was satisfied based on the coordinated nature of the crime.
