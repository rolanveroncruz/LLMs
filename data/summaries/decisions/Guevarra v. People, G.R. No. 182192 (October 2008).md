**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Guevarra***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 182192, October 29, 2008 (591 Phil. 273)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Affirmed conviction of Agripino Guevarra for the murder of Police Chief Inspector Marcos Barte. The Court upheld the credibility of prosecution witnesses (Anacleto and Antonette) who positively identified the accused.
*   **Treachery:** Found to be present as a qualifying circumstance, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, rendering the victim defenseless. Aligned with *Velasco v. People*, G.R. No. 166479, 28 February 2006, 483 SCRA 649, 669-670.
*   **Unlicensed Firearm:** Use of an unlicensed firearm was considered a special aggravating circumstance under Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended by Republic Act No. 8294, as evidenced by certification from PNP Firearms and Explosives Division.
*   **Alibi/Denial:** The accused's defense of alibi and denial was deemed insufficient and weak, not prevailing over positive witness testimonies. Reference to *People v. Aguila*, G.R. No. 171017, 6 December 2006, 510 SCRA 642, 661-662, and *Dela Cruz v. Court of Appeals*, 414 Phil. 171, 184 (2001).
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Appreciated as a mitigating circumstance because the accused surrendered to a person in authority (mayor) before arrest. This is consistent with *Mendoza v. People*, G.R. No. 173551, 4 October 2007, 534 SCRA 668, 697.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua was upheld due to Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty). The special aggravating circumstance of using an unlicensed firearm was deemed not offset by the ordinary mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

**Damages Awarded (Modified by Supreme Court):**

*   **Civil Indemnity:** Increased to P75,000.00, referencing *People v. Buban*, G.R. No. 170471, 11 May 2007, 523 SCRA 118, 134.
*   **Moral Damages:** P50,000.00
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P25,000.00, justified by treachery and the use of an unlicensed firearm (*Article 2230 of the Civil Code*)
*   **Actual Damages:** P109,250.00 (supported by receipts).
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** Increased to P4,213,551.00, calculated using the formula Net Earning Capacity = Life Expectancy x \[Gross Annual Income (GAI) - Living Expenses], based on *People v. Batin*, G.R. No. 177223, 28 November 2007, 539 SCRA 272, 295.
*   **Interest:** Legal interest of 6% imposed on all damages from the date of the decision until fully paid.
*   **Ineligibility for Parole:** The accused is ineligible for parole under Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law), as amended, due to the prohibition in Republic Act No. 9346.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Use of Unlicensed Firearm as an Aggravating Circumstance:**  The document notes that using an unlicensed firearm when committing homicide or murder is a special aggravating circumstance.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance of Voluntary Surrender:** While appreciated, it did not offset the special aggravating circumstance of using an unlicensed firearm.
*  **Computation of Indemnity for Loss of Earning Capacity**: Discrepancy in Computation in the Original Courts.
