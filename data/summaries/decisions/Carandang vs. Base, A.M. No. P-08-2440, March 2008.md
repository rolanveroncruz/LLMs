## Legal Document Summary: Carandang v. Base, A.M. No. P-08-2440

**Case:** Anaclito Carandang v. Remedios Base, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Brooke's Point, Palawan.

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint for "gross and grave misconduct in office" and violation of R.A. No. 3019 ("The Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act").

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Remedios Base (Respondent) allegedly solicited money (initially P3,600, later reduced to P500) from complainant's wife to facilitate the dismissal of a criminal case (Crim. Case No. 17087) against the complainant.  The complainant further alleges unlawful arrest despite the case's prior dismissal.

*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denied solicitation, claimed ignorance of the prior dismissal, stating that the MTC was not furnished a copy of the dismissal order from the RTC Branch 48 (citing certification to that effect) and that the complainant's arrest was based on a valid warrant. She claims the issuing of a commitment order was merely a ministerial duty.

*   **Investigating Judge's Finding:** Recommends dismissal due to lack of evidence of extortion and inconsistencies in complainant's testimony.

*   **OCA's Recommendation:** Agrees with the dismissal of grave misconduct and R.A. No. 3019 charges, but recommends reprimand for the Respondent's unauthorized issuance of a commitment order, which is a judicial function, not an administrative one, thereby overstepping boundaries of functions.

*   **Court Ruling:** Finds Remedios Base GUILTY of Simple Misconduct for arrogating a judicial function by issuing a commitment order. Fined two months' salary with a warning against repetition.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Respondent, as Clerk of Court, has a duty to perform administrative functions and refrain from exercising judicial discretion.
*   Respondent is liable for simple misconduct for issuing the commitment order.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Commitment Order:**  The core risk lies in the unauthorized issuance of a commitment order.  This is a clear deviation from the clerk's permissible actions. The act is held as simple misconduct.
*   **Lack of Notice of Dismissal:** While the Respondent is absolved of deliberate withholding of information regarding the dismissal, the case highlights the risk of administrative inefficiencies in communication between different branches of the judiciary and law enforcement agencies.  The court record from Branch 48 certified that only the Provincial Prosecutor and an SPO3 were provided with the dismissal order, not the MTC where the warrant was active.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019:** "The Anti-graft and Corrupt Practices Act." (Alleged violation, but ultimately dismissed)
*   **Section 9, Rule 112, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:**  Cited by OCA to demonstrate that the issuance of a commitment order is a judicial function.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:**  Used to classify simple misconduct as a less grave offense.
*   **Atty. Jose R. Ortiz, Jr., Clerk of Court VI, Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City vs. Larry de Guzman, Branch Clerk of Court, Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 33, Quezon City (A.M. No. P-03-1708, February 16, 2005):** Cited by OCA to show previous instance of dismissal for issuing orders for the release or commitment of persons charged with penal offenses.
*   **Judge Vallarta v. Vda. De Batoon, 405 Phil. 454, 460 (2001).** Judge, unlike a judicial authority, has no power to order either the commitment or the release on bail of person charged with penal offenses.
*   **Bautista v. Sula, A.M. No. P-04-1920, August 17, 2007, 530 SCRA 406, 418.** Defines simple misconduct.
*   **Angeles v. Base[21] 443 Phil. 723 (2003).** Identifies the case where respondent was previously fined in an amount equivalent to her one-month salary for simple neglect of duty.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "ministerial duty" defense regarding the commitment order is contentious, as the OCA and the Court ultimately reject this characterization, classifying it as an unauthorized exercise of judicial function.
*   Credibility Issues in Extortion Allegation: The court gives weight to the inconsistencies in complainant's statement. The date of incident differs across sworn statements.
