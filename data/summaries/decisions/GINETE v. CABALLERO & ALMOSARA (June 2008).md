**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Abuse of Authority (Caballero):** Allegations of unfair treatment, oppressive management style, bias, and partiality, and high interest rates are unsubstantiated but point to potential abuse of power. If substantiated, these allegations could result in further disciplinary action.
*   **Disputed Evidence:** Allegation of altered affidavit copy submitted by Caballero to the Executive Judge which was made based on the information supplied by Almodiel, this points to an attempted manipulation of evidence.
*   **Lack of Formal Investigation:** The OCA found the charges unsubstantiated with no other evidence presented to support the accusations.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The specific acts constituting "unfair treatment," "oppressive management," "bias," and "partiality" are not detailed, making it difficult to assess the severity of Caballero's actions beyond the immediate incident. The lack of a formal investigation raises concerns about due process.
*   The precise nature of the "unconscionably high interests" charged by Caballero on loans to employees is not quantified, making it difficult to determine if it constitutes a legal violation.
