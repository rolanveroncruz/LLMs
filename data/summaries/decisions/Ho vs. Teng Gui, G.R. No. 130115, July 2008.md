**Case Summary: *Felix Ting Ho, Jr. v. Vicente Teng Gui***

**Citation:** 580 Phil. 378 (G.R. No. 130115, July 16, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 42993, which reversed the RTC decision in Civil Case No. 558-0-88. The case concerns the partition of a parcel of land and improvements (buildings) claimed to belong to the estate of the deceased Felix Ting Ho.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Ownership of Land (Lot 418, Ts-308):**  The Court held that the land is *not* part of the estate of Felix Ting Ho due to constitutional restrictions prohibiting aliens (Felix Ting Ho, a Chinese citizen) from owning public lands (1935 Constitution, Art. XIII, Sec. 1; *Krivenko v. Register of Deeds*, 79 Phil. 461 (1947)). Respondent Vicente Teng Gui, being a Filipino citizen, validly acquired ownership via Miscellaneous Sales Patent No. 7457 and Original Certificate of Title No. P-1064. Registration of title is conclusive and indefeasible (PD 1529, Section 103).
*   **Validity of Implied Trust Claim:** The Court rejected the claim that an implied trust arose between Felix Ting Ho and Vicente Teng Gui.  Citing *Muller v. Muller*, G.R. No. 149615 (2006), the court held that trust arrangements, if proven to circumvent the constitutional prohibition on alien land ownership, would be invalid.
*   **Ownership of Improvements (Buildings):** The Court affirmed the CA and RTC's finding that the Deeds of Sale (Felix Ting Ho to Victoria Cabasal/Gregorio Fontela, then to Vicente Teng Gui) for the buildings were simulated transactions.  However, the Court rejected the RTC's application of Article 1471 of the Civil Code, holding that the simulations are valid donation based only on assumptions. There was no proof, therefore, that the simulation was intended as a donation. It therefore holds that the buildings are part of the estate.
*   **Partition of Buildings:** As the buildings are part of the estate of Felix Ting Ho and Leonila Cabasal, the petitioners are entitled to a four-fifths (4/5) share, with the respondent receiving the remaining one-fifth (1/5).

**Obligations:**

*   The RTC is directed to partition the buildings in accordance with Rule 69 of the Rules of Court and pertinent provisions of the Civil Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   The respondent is not liable to partition the land (Lot 418, Ts-308) as it is his sole property.
*   All heirs, including respondent, are liable to undergo partition proceedings for the buildings.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Proof of Donation (Article 1471, Civil Code):** The application of Article 1471 is contentious. While the Court acknowledged the simulated sales, the lack of positive proof that Felix Ting Ho intended to donate the improvements poses a risk.
*   **Valuation and Partition of Buildings:**  Partition proceedings can be complex and may result in disputes regarding the valuation of the buildings and the fairness of the proposed division.
*   **Alienation of Land Ownership Restrictions:** The prohibition on alien land ownership, while clear, could be challenged based on evolving legal interpretations and international agreements, although this is unlikely to succeed given the explicit constitutional provision.

**Statutory References:**

*   1935 Constitution, Article XIII, Section 1
*   Civil Code, Article 1471
*   Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 103
*   Rule 69, Rules of Court

*   *Muller v. Muller*, G.R. No. 149615, August 29, 2006, 500 SCRA 65.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the simulated sales transactions and the lack of clear intent for donation.
