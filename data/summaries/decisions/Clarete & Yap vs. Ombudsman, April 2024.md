## Legal Document Summary: *Clarete v. Office of the Ombudsman* & *Yap v. Office of the Ombudsman* & *Yap v. Sandiganbayan*

**Case Overview:** This is a consolidation of three petitions related to alleged misuse of PDAF funds allocated to former Representative Marina Clarete during the 14th Congress. The cases involve Clarete, Arthur Cua Yap (former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture), and other government officials/private individuals. The central issue revolves around the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against Clarete and Yap for violations of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Malversation of Public Funds, and Malversation through Falsification, and the Sandiganbayan's (SBN) denial of Yap's Motion to Quash the resulting Informations.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Alleged Scheme:** Clarete allegedly misused her PDAF by channeling funds to NGOs (KKAMFI, KMBFI, AFPI) for "ghost projects" (integrated livelihood development projects). The Ombudsman alleged a scheme involving requests to the Speaker, endorsements to the DBM, releases to Implementing Agencies (IAs) such as DA/NABCOR/NLDC/TRC, and MOAs with NGOs selected by Clarete. These NGOs allegedly submitted fabricated documents to the IAs.
*   **Clarete's Role:** Clarete is accused of unilaterally choosing and endorsing NGOs, disregarding procurement laws (RA 9184), and submitting falsified certifications confirming project implementation.
*   **Yap's Role:** Yap is accused of entering into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with NABCOR regarding Clarete's PDAF. The OMB alleged this constituted manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. Informations against Yap specifically cite his execution of the DA-NABCOR MOA related to SARO No. ROCS-09-04240.
*   **Charges:** Clarete faced 18 counts of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019, 7 counts of malversation, and 11 counts of malversation through falsification. Yap initially faced 2 counts of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019, 1 count of malversation, and 1 count of malversation through falsification.

**Legal Issues & Court Rulings:**

*   **Mootness (G.R. No. 232968 & G.R. No. 232974):** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed Clarete's and Yap's petitions challenging the Ombudsman's probable cause determination, citing the *Relampagos v. Sandiganbayan* doctrine. Once the SBN makes its own judicial determination of probable cause and issues arrest warrants, the issue of the Ombudsman's finding is rendered moot. *People v. Castillo.*
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion (G.R. Nos. 238584-87):** The SC *granted* Yap's petition arguing that the SBN gravely abused its discretion in denying his Motion to Quash. The SC found that the Informations against Yap failed to allege sufficient facts to constitute an offense and demonstrate his participation in the alleged conspiracy. Specific findings included:
    *   **Insufficient Allegations:** The allegations that Yap, as DA Secretary, entered into a MOA with NABCOR were insufficient to establish manifest partiality, evident bad faith, gross inexcusable negligence, or causation of undue injury as required under Section 3(e) of RA 3019. *Tan v. People.*
    *   **Lack of Custody:** The Informations did not establish that Yap was an accountable officer with custody or control over the funds alleged to have been malversed.
    *   **Inordinate Delay:** The SC also ruled that the Ombudsman's preliminary investigation (3 years and 5 days) constituted inordinate delay, violating Yap's right to speedy disposition of cases. Citing *Cagang v. Sandiganbayan*, the Court noted that the delay exceeded the period allowed and the Ombudsman failed to provide a valid justification for the delay. Furthermore, Yap sufficiently demonstrated prejudice resulting from the delay. People v. Sandiganbayan
* Rules of Court, Rule 112, Section 3 (B and F)
* Cojuangco, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan
* Catamco v. Sandiganbayan

**Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conspiracy:** The central weakness was the lack of specific allegations demonstrating Yap's participation in a conspiracy. The Court highlighted the absence of evidence connecting Yap to the selection of the NGO, the lack of bidding, or the falsification of documents.
*   **Inordinate Delay:** The length of the preliminary investigation without sufficient justification from the OMB, combined with the prejudice to Yap, was a key factor in the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **OSG's Position:** The Solicitor General's stance against the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against Yap further weakened the prosecution's case.

**Outcome:**

*   The Petitions for Certiorari challenging the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against Clarete and Yap (G.R. No. 232968 & G.R. No. 232974) were *dismissed as moot*.
*   Yap's Petition for Certiorari challenging the Sandiganbayan's denial of his Motion to Quash (G.R. Nos. 238584-87) was *granted*, and the Informations against him were *dismissed*.
