**Case:** *Adrian M. Kelley vs. Atty. Cipriano D. Robielos III* A.C. No. 13955, January 30, 2024

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Robielos for violating Canons II and III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA). The violations stem from issuing a worthless check to pay a debt, failing to settle the debt despite demand and a subsequent agreement, and disregarding orders from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) during disciplinary proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon II, CPRA (Propriety):**  Atty. Robielos engaged in unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct by issuing a bad check, violating Rule 1.01 of the old CPR. This constitutes moral turpitude. Case law cited includes *Lim v. Atty. Rivera* and *Linsangan v. Atty. Lucero*.
*   **Canon III, Section 2, CPRA (Fidelity):**  Atty. Robielos failed to promote respect for legal processes by ignoring IBP directives (failure to file answer, attend mandatory conference, submit position paper).
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22:** Implicitly referenced; issuance of a worthless check is a violation, even without a criminal conviction (citing *Enriquez v. De Vera*).

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Disbarment:** Ultimate penalty imposed due to the seriousness and repeated nature of the offenses.
*   **Fine of PHP 35,000.00:**  For disobedience to IBP orders, per Canon VI, Section 37(b)(2) of the CPRA (less serious offense).
*   **Obligation to Pay Debt:** Ordered to pay Adrian M. Kelley the outstanding debt and comply with the Writ of Execution from the MTC.

**Recidivism & Aggravating Circumstances:**

*   Atty. Robielos has a history of disciplinary actions for similar misconduct, including *Phie v. Atty. Robielos III* (3-month suspension) and *Mangayan v. Atty. Robielos* (5-year suspension for issuing worthless checks), making him a recidivist.
*   The court considered the previous sanctions as aggravating circumstances, contributing to the decision to disbar.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of "Returning a Favor":**  Dismissed as unsubstantiated and a fabrication.
*   **Retroactive Application of CPRA:** The court explicitly states that the CPRA applies due to the transitory provision (Section 1), as its retroactive application is deemed feasible and just.
*   **Enforcement of MTC Judgment:** The Supreme Court ordered compliance with the MTC writ of execution, however, the collectability of the debt remains a practical concern.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Lim v. Atty. Rivera, 833 Phil. 609 (2018)*: Issuance of worthless checks and failure to pay debts constitute gross misconduct.
*   *Enriquez v. De Vera*: A lawyer's act of issuing a worthless check, punishable under Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, constitutes serious misconduct.
*   *Linsangan v. Atty. Lucero, A.C. No. 13664, January 23, 2023*: Issuance of a worthless check is a violation of the law.
*   *Lao v. Medel, 453 Phil. 115 (2003)*: Deliberate failure to pay just debts and the issuance of worthless checks constitute gross misconduct.
*   *A-1 Financial Services Inc. v. Atty. Valerio, 636 Phil. 627 (2010)*: Similar fact pattern led to a two-year suspension.
*   *Phie v. Atty. Robielos III, A.C. No. 7849, August 28, 2019*: Prior disciplinary action against Atty. Robielos.
*   *Mangayan v. Atty. Robielos, A.C. No. 11520, April 5, 2022*: Prior disciplinary action against Atty. Robielos.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the Supreme Court's strict stance on lawyers who engage in dishonest financial dealings and disregard IBP directives. Atty. Robielos' disbarment underscores the importance of maintaining a high standard of moral character and complying with legal processes within and outside the legal profession.
