## Legal Document Summary: Quilo v. Jundarino, A.M. No. P-09-2644

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Edgardo A. Quilo
*   **Respondent:** Rogelio G. Jundarino, Sheriff III, Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), Branch 19, Manila

**Subject Matter:** Administrative complaint for Grave Misconduct, Oppression, Coercion, and Harassment against Sheriff Jundarino related to the implementation of a Writ of Execution in an unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 158273-CV).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Unlawful Detainer Case (Bajao v. Saclag, et al.) decided in favor of Bajao.  The judgment ordered Saclag, et al. to vacate the premises, demolish structures, pay attorney's fees (P20,000), and costs of suit. This judgment was affirmed by the RTC, CA, and ultimately the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 142592).
*   **Writ of Execution:**  Issued by the MeTC Judge Cacanindin on 28 November 2007, directing the sheriff to (1) surrender possession of the premises; (2) demolish structures; (3) collect attorney's fees (P20,000); and (4) collect costs.
*   **Complaint:** Quilo filed a complaint alleging that Sheriff Jundarino:
    *   Served a Notice to Pay/Vacate/Demolish at Quilo's residence (2518 Granate St.) despite Quilo not being a party to the case (which involved 2519 Granate St.).
    *   Threatened Quilo ("ikaw ang una kong tatrabahuin...").
    *   Forcibly entered Quilo's house on March 27, 2008, with Bajao and others, demanding immediate demolition.
    *   Coerced Quilo's wife into signing an agreement to voluntarily vacate by April 10, 2008, without providing a copy of the agreement.
*   **Sheriff's Defense:** Denied the specific date of first visit, forceful entry, coercion, and alleged threatening statements.  Argued that Quilo's concerns were unfounded if he was not a party to the case and resided at a different address.  Claimed Quilo was related to a defendant through a rental agreement.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Found Sheriff Jundarino guilty of simple misconduct and recommended a fine of three months' salary.
*   **Res Judicata Issue:** The Court addressed whether a prior dismissed administrative complaint (A.M. No. MTJ-08-2078) against both Judge Cacanindin and Sheriff Jundarino barred the present action. The Court held that res judicata did not apply because the causes of action were different. The previous case concerned ignorance of the law by the judge, and excessive authority of the sheriff for proceeding with the execution and demolition despite pending motions and judicial remedies. The current case concerned the actions and demeanor of the sheriff in his execution of the writ of execution.

**Court's Holding:** Sheriff Jundarino found LIABLE for simple misconduct. Ordered to pay a fine equivalent to three months' salary, with a warning against repetition.

**Reasoning:**

*   Denial alone is a weak defense. The sheriff failed to provide evidence to support his denials.
*   Sheriff acted imprudently by insisting on implementing the Writ given Quilo's claim of a different address and his pending Motion to Quash.
*   Sheriff's threatening statements and aggressive behavior violated the standard of conduct for judicial employees, which requires propriety, decorum, restraint, courtesy, and dignity.
*   Cites OCA v. Judge Octavio A. Fernandez for the definition of misconduct.
*   Since this was Jundarino's first offense in his 16 years of service, a fine was deemed appropriate instead of suspension (referencing Section 52, B(2), Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service).

**Key Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Sheriff's obligation to act with propriety, decorum, restraint, courtesy, and dignity when implementing court orders.
*   Sheriff's obligation to conduct himself above suspicion and not err in serving court writs and processes.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The case highlights the potential for abuse of power by sheriffs during execution of judgments, particularly in eviction cases.
*   The dispute regarding the address (2518 vs. 2519 Granate St.) remains a potential source of future conflict.
*   The Court's characterization of the Sheriff's actions as "simple misconduct" might be viewed as lenient given the allegations of threat and coercion.
*   While the court says the previous case had issues "judicial in nature", it is possible that the defense would try to say the present case is also one of the same based on similar facts.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Nabus v. Court of Appeals** (res judicata)
*   **Basilla v. Becamon** (res judicata)
*   **Cayana v. Court of Appeals** (res judicata)
*   **Lumibao v. Panal** (administrative complaint is not substitute for judicial action)
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Octavio A. Fernandez** (definition of misconduct)
*   **Section 52, B(2), Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service** (penalties for simple misconduct)
*   Numerous cases cited emphasizing the required conduct of court employees, particularly sheriffs.

**For Further Analysis:**

*   Review the original Writ of Execution and supporting documents in Civil Case No. 158273-CV to verify the address.
*   Investigate the relationship between Quilo and Saclag et al. to determine the validity of the Sheriff's claim of connection.
*   Examine the contents of the document Quilo's wife was allegedly coerced into signing.
*   Analysis of A.M. No. MTJ-08-2078 to see if this case should have been barred on the ground of *res judicata*.
