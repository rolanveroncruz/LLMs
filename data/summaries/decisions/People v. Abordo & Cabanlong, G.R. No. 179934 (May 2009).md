**Case Summary: People v. Abordo and Cabanlong, G.R. No. 179934, May 21, 2009 (606 Phil. 129)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Erlinda Abordo (Abordo) for estafa and illegal recruitment (Criminal Case Nos. V-0654 & V-0655) and Abordo and Vina Cabanlong (Cabanlong) for estafa and illegal recruitment (Criminal Case Nos. V-0767, V-0769, V-0772 & V-0768, V-0770, V-0771).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Labor Code, Art. 38 & 39, as amended by P.D. 2018):** Abordo and Cabanlong, without the necessary license or authority from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), recruited Jesus Rayray, Jaime Fernandez, Exequiel Mendoza, and Esmenia Cariño for overseas employment in exchange for placement fees. The CA modified the RTC ruling, finding them guilty of *simple* illegal recruitment, instead of illegal recruitment in large scale, as the information for each case only concerned one complainant.
    *   Relevant Sections: Article 13(b) Labor Code (definition of recruitment and placement).
    *   Statutory Reference: RA 8042, Section 7(a) (Penalties for Illegal Recruitment)

*   **Estafa (Revised Penal Code, Art. 315, 2(a)):** By falsely pretending to possess the power to deploy persons for overseas employment, the accused deceived the complainants into believing that they would provide overseas employment and collecting placement fees.
    *   Relevant Element: Deceit executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, causing damage to the complainants.
    *   Potential Challenges: Defendants claimed to receive placement fees on behalf of a travel agency.

*   **Dual Conviction:** Conviction for both illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and estafa under the Revised Penal Code is permissible, as the elements of each crime are distinct. Citing: *People v. Ortiz-Miyake, 344 Phil. 598, 614 (1997)*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Imprisonment:** Abordo and Cabanlong are subject to imprisonment terms for both illegal recruitment (6 years and 1 day to 12 years) and estafa (varying indeterminate sentences, dependent on the amount defrauded).
*   **Monetary Restitution:** Both are jointly and severally liable to reimburse the complainants for the amounts defrauded, plus legal interest from the filing of the information until fully paid.
    *   Jesus Rayray: P14,000
    *   Jaime Fernandez: P45,000
    *   Exequiel Mendoza: P39,000
    *   Esmenia Cariño: P15,000

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Division into Minimum, Medium, and Maximum periods for Penalties:** The Court clarified the method for dividing the penalties into the proper periods under Article 65 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
*   **Successive Service of Sentence:** Due to the nature of the penalties, the terms of imprisonment must be served successively, not simultaneously.
*   **Legal Interest:** Payment of legal interest until debt is paid could mean a substantial addition to the owed amounts.
