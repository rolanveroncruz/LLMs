## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines vs. J.L. Jocson and Sons*

**Case:** G.R. No. 180803, October 23, 2009

**Subject Matter:** Determination of just compensation for 27.3808 hectares of tenanted rice land expropriated under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27 (Operation Land Transfer - OLT) and awarded to tenant-beneficiaries.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Respondent (J.L. Jocson and Sons):** Claimed DAR's initial compensation offer (based on P.D. No. 27 and Executive Order [E.O.] No. 228) was grossly inadequate and sought just compensation based on Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988).
*   **Petitioner (Land Bank):** Argued that P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 should govern valuation as the property was acquired under OLT and the SAC erred in using a P300.00 GSP instead of P35.00 as provided under E.O. No. 228.
*   **Special Agrarian Court (SAC):** Fixed just compensation at P2,564,403.58 based on a higher valuation of P93,657.00/hectare, similar to that applied to an adjacent landholding under R.A. No. 6657.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** Initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, stating it involved pure questions of law.
*   **Supreme Court (SC):** Found the CA erred in dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, as the issues raised included mixed questions of fact and law. However, the SC resolved the substantive issue directly.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank:** Obligated to pay respondent the determined just compensation.
*   **Respondent:** Implicit obligation to transfer title to the DAR upon full payment of just compensation.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Land Bank:** Significant financial liability to pay the difference between the initial offer and the SAC-determined just compensation, with potential interest. Risk of similar rulings in other cases if R.A. 6657 is applied retroactively.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:** Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants.
*   **E.O. No. 228:** Declaring Full Land Ownership and determining the value of remaining unvalued rice and corn lands.
*   **R.A. No. 6657 (CARL):** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988. Section 17 provides guidelines for determining just compensation.
*   **Section 60 & 61, R.A. No. 6657:** Appeals process from SAC Decisions.
*   **Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines (G.R. No. 148223, November 25, 2004):** Initially cited for the proposition that just compensation is determined at the time of taking. Later distinguished in the present decision.
*   **National Power Corp. v. Gutierrez (G.R. No. 60077, January 18, 1991):** Cited by Land Bank for valuing land at the time of taking.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Chico (G.R. No. 168453, March 13, 2009):** SC declared that R.A. No. 6657 is the relevant law for determining just compensation at the time of payment.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Estanislao (G.R. No. 166777, July 10, 2007):** SC held that the just compensation should be determined and the process concluded under R.A. No. 6657, with P.D. 27 and E.O. 228 having only suppletory effect.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive application of R.A. No. 6657:** Whether and how R.A. No. 6657 applies to land expropriated under P.D. No. 27 but where just compensation was not yet fully paid before R.A. No. 6657's enactment. The Supreme Court resolves the issue by applying R.A. No. 6657.
*   **Government Support Price (GSP):** Determining the correct GSP for 1992. The SAC's use of P300.00/cavan was upheld due to the Land Bank's failure to provide evidence to the contrary.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision and *reinstated* the SAC's decision, ordering Land Bank to pay the remaining balance of the determined just compensation (P1,660,766.55).

**Key Takeaway:** The Supreme Court, departing from previous rulings, held that R.A. No. 6657 applies when just compensation for land expropriated under P.D. No. 27 had not been fully paid before R.A. No. 6657's enactment. This signifies a potential shift towards valuing expropriated lands at the time of payment rather than at the time of taking, potentially increasing Land Bank's financial liabilities in similar cases.
