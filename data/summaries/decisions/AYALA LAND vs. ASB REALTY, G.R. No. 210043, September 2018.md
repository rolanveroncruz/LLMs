**Case:** Ayala Land, Inc. vs. ASB Realty Corporation and E.M. Ramos & Sons, Inc., G.R. No. 210043, September 26, 2018.

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the sale of a 372-hectare property in Dasmari√±as, Cavite, owned by E.M. Ramos & Sons, Inc. (EMRASON). Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI) entered into a Contract to Sell with the Ramos children (Emerita B. Ramos, Jr. et al.), while ASB Realty Corporation (ASBRC) entered into a Letter-Agreement with EMRASON (represented by Emerito Ramos, Sr., President). ALI sought to enforce its Contract to Sell, while ASBRC and EMRASON sought its nullification and the enforcement of the Letter-Agreement.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Contract to Sell (ALI & Ramos Children):** Declared *void* and *unenforceable*. The Ramos children lacked the *actual authority* from EMRASON's Board of Directors to sell the property. ALI failed to prove that the Ramos Children had the authority to enter into a contract of sale on behalf of EMRASON.
*   **Letter-Agreement (ASBRC & EMRASON):** Declared *valid*, *binding*, and *enforceable*. Emerito Ramos, Sr., as President of EMRASON, had *apparent authority* to enter into the Letter-Agreement. Even if Emerito Ramos, Sr. lacked authority, the subsequent ratification by EMRASON's stockholders cured any defect.
*   **Doctrine of Apparent Authority:** The Court addressed the applicability of this doctrine, noting that persons dealing with an agent must ascertain both the fact of agency and the extent of the agent's authority. ALI failed to establish that EMRASON, through its actions, intentionally led ALI to believe the Ramos children possessed the authority to sell the property. Case law references *Professional Services, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 568 Phil. 158, 168 (2008) and *Woodchild Holdings, Inc. v. Roxas Electric and Construction Company, Inc.* 479 Phil. 896, 914 (2004).
*   **Corporate Authority:** The Court emphasized that a corporation acts through its Board of Directors and not through its controlling shareholders. Case law references *First Philippine Holdings Corporation v. Trans Middle East (Phils.) Equities, Inc.*, 622 Phil. 623, 628 (2009) and *Associated Bank v. Pronstroller*, 580 Phil. 104, 118 (2008).
*   **Damages:** ALI and the Ramos children were jointly and severally ordered to pay ASB and EMRASON damages. The Ramos children's motion to dismiss the cross-claim was denied due to a lack of factual basis, and was jointly and severally ordered to pay ASB and EMRASON damages for the failure to deliver on the contract of sale.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1318 of the New Civil Code:** Essential requisites of contracts (consent, object, cause).
*   **Article 1431 of the Civil Code:** Estoppel.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Apparent Authority:** The key risk for ALI was relying on the apparent authority of the Ramos children without adequately verifying their actual authority. The Court found that ALI should have been more diligent in ascertaining the scope of their authority, especially given the nature of the transaction.
*   **Formal Defects in Contract to Sell:** The RTC and CA decisions highlight the importance of adhering to basic contract formalities. The omission of the EMRASON representatives' names and titles in the Contract to Sell contributed to the finding that ALI had doubts about their authority.

**Key Case Law:**

*   **People's Aircargo and Warehousing Company, Inc. v. Court of Appeals**, 357 Phil. 850 (1998):  Used to differentiate the Ramos children to have apparent authority to bind EMRASON.
*   **Nogales v. Capitol Medical Center**, 540 Phil. 225 (2006): Addresses the doctrine of apparent authority or ostensible agency.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding that the Contract to Sell between ALI and the Ramos children was void due to the lack of authority of the Ramos children. The Letter-Agreement between ASBRC and EMRASON was upheld based on the apparent authority of the company President and subsequent ratification by the stockholders. ALI's petition was denied, and was ordered to pay damages.
