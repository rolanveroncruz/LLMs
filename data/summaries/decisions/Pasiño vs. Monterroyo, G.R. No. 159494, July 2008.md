Here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for legal precision:

**Case:** *Pasiño v. Monterroyo*, G.R. No. 159494, July 31, 2008 (582 Phil. 703)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC's dismissal of Petitioners' action for recovery of possession and damages.

**Facts:** Petitioners (Pasiños), claiming through Laureano Pasiño's homestead application initiated in 1935, sought to recover possession of Cadastral Lot No. 2139 from Respondents (Monterroyos). Petitioners obtained Free Patent Titles in 1994. Respondents claimed ownership and possession since 1949 through a series of conveyances originating from Rufo Larumbe.

**RTC Ruling:** Dismissed Pasiños' complaint; declared Lot 2139 private land; declared Monterroyos the owners and possessors; nullified Pasiños' Free Patent Titles, finding fraud and lack of jurisdiction in the Land Management Bureau's issuance.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC; rejected Pasiños' appeal; ruled that the Land Management Bureau lacked jurisdiction due to Lot 2139 becoming private land through acquisitive prescription.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Acquisitive Prescription:**  A fundamental issue revolves around whether the land was already private, due to open, continuous, and exclusive possession for the statutory period (30 years under the Public Land Act, *Director of Lands v. IAC*, 230 Phil. 590 (1986)) before the issuance of Free Patents to the Pasiños.
*   **Homestead Patent Registration:** The non-registration of Laureano Pasiño's homestead patent is crucial. Sec. 103 of PD No. 1529 mandates registration as the operative act of conveyance. Without registration, the patent order became *functus officio*.
*   **Counterclaim as Direct Attack:** Monterroyos' counterclaim for ownership directly attacked the validity of the Pasiños' titles, permissible under *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*, 387 Phil. 283 (2000). This contrasts with a prohibited collateral attack.
*   **Constructive Trust:** The Court imposed a constructive trust on the Pasiños' titles, derived from the circumstances where land is wrongfully registered in another's name (*Heirs of Tabia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. Nos. 129377 & 129399, 22 February 2007). The Court mandated reconveyance to the Monterroyos, who demonstrated superior right.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Nullification of Titles:** The Pasiños face the loss of their Free Patent Titles and the property due to the Court's finding that the titles were improperly issued.
*   **Breach of Warranty (Potential):** If the Pasiños conveyed any interest in reliance on their Free Patent Titles, they could face actions for breach of warranty.
*   **Costs of Litigation:** Pasiños are liable for the costs of litigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Public Land Act:** Governs acquisition of title to public lands, especially through homestead patents and free patents.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Specifically, Sec. 103 regarding the operative effect of registration.
*   ***Director of Lands v. IAC*, 230 Phil. 590 (1986):** Establishes that alienable public land held for the statutory period is converted to private land *ipso jure*.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals*, 387 Phil. 283 (2000):** Confirms that a counterclaim can serve as a direct attack on a title.
*   ***Heirs of Tabia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. Nos. 129377 & 129399, 22 February 2007:**  Defines and applies the principle of constructive trust in land registration cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention revolved around the date at which possession by the Respondents and their predecessors-in-interest transferred the land to the private domain. Evidence for this was contested, focusing on deeds of sale, transfer, and the delivery of harvests, but the court deferred to the Trial Court due to the precedence for lower courts making factual findings.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

The Pasiños face a high risk of losing the property permanently. The Court upheld the findings that the land was already private when they applied for free patents, and that Respondents had superior ownership rights established through prior possession and conveyance. Further, the Court found that the Pasiños fraudulently claimed continuous and public possession when applying for the Free Patents.
