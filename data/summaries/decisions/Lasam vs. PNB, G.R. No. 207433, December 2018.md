**Case Summary: *Dr. Fe Lasam v. Philippine National Bank (PNB)***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 207433, December 5, 2018 (844 Phil. 781)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging RTC orders dismissing a petition for relief from a final order in a case for annulment of mortgage. The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 38, Sections 1 & 2, Rules of Court:** Defines the remedy of petition for relief from judgment due to fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence.
*   **Rule 38, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Sets jurisdictional time limits for filing a petition for relief: (1) 60 days from knowledge of the judgment/order, and (2) 6 months from entry of the judgment/order. *Both periods must concur.*
*   **Failure to Prosecute:** Original dismissal of the annulment of mortgage case was due to failure to prosecute, specifically non-appearance of counsel.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's (Lasam's) Liability:**  The core issue is Lasam's failure to comply with the strict deadlines under Rule 38, specifically both the 60-day and 6-month periods. The SC held that the deadlines are jurisdictional and cannot be extended.
*   **Attorney Negligence:**  Lasam argued gross negligence by her former counsel. However, the Court did not address if counsel's negligence was so egregious as to warrant relief from the general rule that a client is bound by the actions of their lawyer, due to the untimeliness of the Petition for Relief.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The SC emphasized the importance of the finality of judgments. Rule 38 is an equitable remedy strictly construed to prevent erosion of the finality principle.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:**  The SC noted that Lasam improperly filed a direct petition for certiorari, bypassing the Court of Appeals. This violation of the hierarchy of courts was another basis for dismissal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The most contentious issue is the interpretation of "knowledge" of the February 23, 2010 Order.  Lasam argued her knowledge should be reckoned from when she *understood* its finality after consulting new counsel. The SC rejected this, stating the 60-day period starts from the date of knowledge of the *order itself*, regardless of finality awareness.
*   The question of whether counsel's negligence rose to the level of "gross negligence" that could justify granting the petition for relief, despite its being time-barred, was left unanswered.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC decision strongly emphasizes adherence to procedural rules, particularly the strict deadlines in Rule 38.  It underscores the principle of finality of judgments. Lasam's case was ultimately unsuccessful due to her failure to meet the jurisdictional timeframes for filing a petition for relief. The case serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of diligent monitoring of legal proceedings and prompt action within prescribed deadlines.
