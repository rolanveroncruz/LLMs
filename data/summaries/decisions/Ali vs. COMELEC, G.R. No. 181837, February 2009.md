Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Ali v. COMELEC*:

**Case:** *Omar M. "Solitario" Ali v. COMELEC, et al.* G.R. No. 181837, February 4, 2009

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's dismissal of Omar Ali's pre-proclamation appeals and motions (annul proclamation, correct manifest errors) concerning the 2007 Lanao del Sur gubernatorial election, where he lost to Mamintal A. Adiong, Jr. Ali alleged irregularities in the MCOCs from Picong, Ganassi, Buadiposo-Buntong, and Bumbaran.

**Key Provisions/Allegations & COMELEC Rulings:**

*   **Picong:** Ali claimed 29 election returns were signed by unauthorized individuals. COMELEC rejected this, noting the "tentative" nature of the provided BEI list and lack of evidence proving unauthorized persons acted as BEIs. This also wasn't a proper subject of pre-proclamation controversy per Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code
*   **Ganassi:** Ali alleged incomplete canvass (6 precincts) and watcher exclusion.  COMELEC deemed the incomplete canvass MOOT due to the subsequent special elections.  Other claims were not proper subjects of pre-proclamation cases, and the inclusion of the returns was justified.
*   **Buadiposo-Buntong:** Ali asserted manufactured MCOC due to vote totals exceeding the number of voters and alleged padding of votes for Adiong based on tabulator affidavits. COMELEC dismissed the manifest error claim citing the lack of supporting evidence beyond the affidavits and the failure to specify errors as required by COMELEC Resolution No. 7859, Section 35. Election returns have a *prima facie* status.
*   **Bumbaran:** Ali argued that the vote counting location violated a COMELEC directive. The COMELEC found that the Regional Election Director had approved counting in Bumbaran.

**Legal Issues & Holdings:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:**  The Court held that the COMELEC did NOT commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Ali's claims. The Court deferred to the COMELEC's fact-finding and expertise in election matters, noting that its findings, when supported by substantial evidence, are generally final and non-reviewable. Grave abuse of discretion requires a capricious, whimsical, and arbitrary exercise of judgment, amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Scope of Pre-Proclamation Controversy:** The Court reiterated that pre-proclamation controversies are limited to issues enumerated in Section 243 of the Omnibus Election Code: illegal composition of the board of canvassers, tampered/falsified returns, returns prepared under duress, or fraudulent substitute returns.
*   **Evidence Aliunde:** The Court emphasized the summary nature of pre-proclamation controversies, noting that the Board of Canvassers and the COMELEC are not to look beyond or behind the election returns which are on their face regular and authentic returns. There is generally no room for evidence *aliunde* (extrinsic evidence), inspection of voluminous documents, and meticulous technical examinations.
*   **Remedy:** Election protest is the proper remedy if a candidate believes there was fraud or irregularities in the election.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 243:** Defines the scope of pre-proclamation controversies.
*   **R.A. 7166, Sec. 20 (i):** rel: Violation of not declaring that there was a violation of this law.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 7859, Sec. 35 & 39 (13):** rel: Requirement to show compliance with the law, Any bare assertion of correction of manifest error must not be given credence.
*   **COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 07-0925**

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Weight of Affidavits:** The case highlights the need for more than just affidavits to substantiate claims of manifest error or irregularities. The affidavits alone were insufficient to overcome the *prima facie* validity of the election returns.
*   **Definition of "Manifest Error":** The decision implicitly reinforces a strict interpretation of "manifest error," requiring specific identification of the error and supporting documentation.
