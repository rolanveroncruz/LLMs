**Case Summary: Tiongson vs. NHA, G.R. No. 140377 (2008)**

**Legal Issue:** Determination of the appropriate date for reckoning just compensation in an expropriation case where the initial taking occurred under an unconstitutional decree.  Specifically, whether just compensation should be based on the 1978 taking under P.D. Nos. 1669 and 1670 (later declared unconstitutional) or the 1987 filing of the expropriation complaint.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **1978 Taking:** NHA took possession of the properties under P.D. Nos. 1669 and 1670, aimed at expropriating land for socialized housing (Tambunting Estate & Estero de Sunog-Apog).
*   **Unconstitutionality:**  In *Manotok v. NHA* (G.R. No. L-55166/7, 1987), the Supreme Court declared P.D. Nos. 1669 and 1670 unconstitutional for violating due process.
*   **1987 Expropriation Complaint:**  NHA subsequently filed a complaint for expropriation (Civil Case No. 87-42018) in the RTC Manila for the same properties. The RTC initially ruled just compensation should be reckoned from the filing of the complaint.
*   **Appellate Court Decision:**  The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, holding that just compensation should be based on the 1978 taking.  It relied on an initial provisional agreement of the parties that NHA took possession of the properties in 1978.
*   **Judicial Admissions:**  The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, emphasizing that NHA's own pleadings in the RTC expropriation case acknowledged that its possession *terminated* when P.D. Nos. 1669 and 1670 were declared unconstitutional. The SC considered these to be judicial admissions.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The SC held that the just compensation should be determined as of **September 14, 1987**, the date the NHA filed the expropriation complaint. This is based on Rule 67, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.
*   The SC reasoned that the initial taking in 1978 was unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of the decrees authorizing it. The NHA's possession under the decrees ceased upon the SC's declaration of unconstitutionality.
*   NHA's admissions in its pleadings were critical in determining the date of reckoning.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **NHA Obligation:** NHA is obligated to pay just compensation determined as of September 14, 1987.
*   **Potential Liability of NHA:** Paying the compensation retroactively.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** Determining the fair market value of the properties as of September 14, 1987, could lead to further disputes regarding valuation methodology and evidence.
*   **Continuing Possession:** While the initial "taking" was invalidated, the NHA has likely remained in possession throughout the litigation. The decision doesn't explicitly address whether the NHA will have to relinquish possession and then retake it under a valid order of expropriation (unlikely). The order of expropriation in itself dictates that payment must be given for the party to retain ownership.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 67, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Establishes the date of taking or filing of the complaint as the basis for determining just compensation.
*   ***Manotok v. NHA* (G.R. No. L-55166/7, 1987):** Declared P.D. Nos. 1669 and 1670 unconstitutional.
*   **Presidential Decree Nos. 1669 & 1670**: Original decrees authorizing the expropriation, later deemed unconstitutional.
*   **Rule 129, Section 4**: Provides for the evidentiary value of judicial admissions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision does not explicitly state any clauses, but leaves some details implicit, such as the NHA's responsibility to handle the payment of just compensation on the set date.

**Legal Advice:**

*   Thoroughly assess the market value of the properties as of September 14, 1987, using appraisal experts. Prepare for potential challenges to the valuation from the landowners.
*   Carefully review the procedural requirements for payment of just compensation under Rule 67 to ensure compliance.
*   Consider negotiating a settlement with the landowners to avoid prolonged and costly litigation over valuation.
