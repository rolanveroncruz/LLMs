Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rockland Construction Company, Inc. vs. Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation*, G.R. No. 164587, February 4, 2008

**Issue:** Whether a perfected contract of lease existed between Rockland (Petitioner) and Mid-Pasig (Respondent) and whether Mid-Pasig was estopped from denying the lease.

**Holding:** No perfected contract of lease existed, and Mid-Pasig was not estopped. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision dismissing Rockland's complaint for specific performance.

**Key Facts:**

*   Rockland offered to lease property from Mid-Pasig.
*   Rockland sent a check for P1 million to Mid-Pasig as a sign of good faith, stipulating terms in a letter.
*   Mid-Pasig deposited the check. However, it claimed it did so without knowledge of its origin or purpose, and subsequently rejected Rockland's offer.
*   Rockland sued for specific performance, alleging implied acceptance of the lease offer by the deposit of the check and estoppel.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Contract Formation (Article 1318, 1319, 1320 Civil Code):** The Court focused on whether there was a meeting of the minds – a definite offer and absolute acceptance – as required for contract formation. The Court held there was no acceptance, as Mid-Pasig claimed ignorance of the check's origin and rejected the offer upon learning of it.
*   **Estoppel in Pais:** Rockland argued Mid-Pasig's deposit of the check constituted estoppel, preventing it from denying the existence of the lease.
*   **The Court found against estoppel, referencing *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, Nos. L-30831 & L-31176, November 21, 1979, 94 SCRA 357, 368.* and *La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 103200, August 31, 1994, 236 SCRA 78, 87.* noting that Mid-Pasig did not make false representations, and Rockland never secured the necessary approvals to enter into a lease. Estoppel requires unequivocal and intentional conduct causing detrimental reliance.**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguous Conduct:** Rockland argued the deposit of the check was implied acceptance. The Court rejected this based on Mid-Pasig's claim of ignorance and subsequent rejection.
*   **Impact of PCGG Control:** The property was under PCGG control. While not explicitly a central argument, the need for PCGG approval to lease the property was a potential hurdle Rockland never cleared.

**Case Law:**

*   *Swedish Match, AB v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128120, October 20, 2004, 441 SCRA 1:* Referenced for the elements of a contract and the requirements of a valid offer and acceptance.
*   *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, Nos. L-30831 & L-31176, November 21, 1979, 94 SCRA 357, 368:* Cited for principles related to estoppel.
*   *La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 103200, August 31, 1994, 236 SCRA 78, 87:* Cited for principles related to estoppel.
