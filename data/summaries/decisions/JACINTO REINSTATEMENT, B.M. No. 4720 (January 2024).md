## Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Petition to Retain/Reacquire the Privilege to Resume the Practice of Law in the Philippines, Regina Stella P. Jacinto* (B.M. No. 4720, January 30, 2024)

**Nature:** Resolution of the Supreme Court (En Banc) regarding a petition to formalize the privilege to practice law in the Philippines after acquiring foreign citizenship.

**Key Issue:** Whether Regina Stella P. Jacinto, having acquired Maltese citizenship, can formalize her privilege to practice law in the Philippines, despite holding dual citizenship.

**Ruling:** Petition granted, subject to retaking the Lawyer's Oath, signing the Roll of Attorneys, and paying appropriate fees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Jacinto acquired Maltese citizenship (May 29, 2023) but retained Philippine citizenship under RA 9225, the "Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003." She argues the Maltese Citizenship Act permits dual citizenship. She formalized her retention via petition with the Bureau of Immigration (BI).
*   **RA 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003):** Allows natural-born Filipinos to retain Philippine citizenship despite acquiring foreign citizenship, *provided* they take an oath of allegiance to the Republic. The court held that it doesn't distinguish those who 'retain' or 'reacquired' citizenship in relation to practicing a profession.
*   **Section 5, RA 9225:** Individuals who retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship and intend to practice their profession in the Philippines **must apply** with the proper authority for a license or permit.  This is a key provision requiring further action beyond mere retention of citizenship.
*   **Rule 138, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Requires Philippine citizenship for admission to the bar.
*   **Obligation to Re-take Oath and Sign Roll:** The Court, following the precedent of *In Re: Muneses*, requires Jacinto to retake the Lawyer's Oath and sign the Roll of Attorneys.  This step acknowledges the interruption of practice and reinstates the privilege.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Compliance Failure:** Failure to comply with the requirement to retake the oath, sign the Roll, or pay fees will negate the grant of the petition.
*   **Future Conduct:** Continued practice of law is contingent on maintaining good standing with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and adherence to ethical standards, as underscored by the court, citing *In Re: Muneses* and *In Re: Dacanay*.
*   **Potential Challenges:** While the petition was granted, future challenges could arise if Jacinto violates the conditions outlined in Section 5 of RA 9225 (e.g., holding public office in Malta or serving in its armed forces).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003):** Central to the ruling. Its provisions regarding retention of citizenship and requirements for practicing a profession are heavily relied upon.
*   **Rule 138, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Establishes citizenship as a requirement for Bar admission.
*   **In Re: Muneses, 691 Phil. 583 (2012):** Establishes the precedent for requiring re-application to practice law after re-acquisition of citizenship and specifies required documentation. Used as a reference for retained citizenship as well.
*   **In Re: Dacanay, 565 Phil. 165 (2007):** Reinforces the principle that Philippine citizenship is a continuing requirement for the practice of law.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Apply with Proper Authority":**  The phrase "apply with the proper authority" in Section 5 of RA 9225, in this context, equates to filing a petition with the Supreme Court, as clarified through the application of *In Re: Muneses*.
*   **No Loss of Citizenship vs. Reacquisition:** While Jacinto technically retained citizenship, the court applies the same requirements as if she had reacquired it, citing lack of distinction in Section 5 of RA 9225.

**Conclusion:**

The Court granted Jacinto's petition, allowing her to formalize her privilege to practice law. However, the resolution highlights the continuing nature of citizenship requirements and the need to comply with specific procedures after acquiring foreign citizenship, even when Philippine citizenship is technically retained.  Future compliance with ethical and professional standards remains crucial. The resolution relies heavily on existing jurisprudence concerning the reacquisition of citizenship, extending its principles to cases of citizenship retention for purposes of resuming law practice.
