## Legal Document Summary: *Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. vs. Asprec, Jr.*

**Case:** *Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI) and Sarah Delgado vs. Rolando Asprec, Jr. and Jonalen Bataller* (G.R. No. 217301, June 06, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision which reinstated the LA's decision finding CBMI and Philippine Pizza, Inc.-Pizza Hut (PPI) solidarity liable for illegal dismissal of the respondents.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employment Status:** The central issue is whether Asprec and Bataller were employees of CBMI or PPI. The Supreme Court (SC) reverses the CA and finds that CBMI, not PPI, was the employer. The Court held that CBMI is an independent contractor and not a labor-only contractor based on the following:
    *   **Substantial Capitalization:** CBMI possessed significant assets, exceeding PHP 84 million in 2010.
    *   **Independent Business:** CBMI had been in operation since 1967 and provided services to various clients (De La Salle University, US Embassy, etc.)
    *   **DOLE Registration:** CBMI was a duly licensed labor contractor by the DOLE at the time of hiring. The court ruled that as the primary agency tasked to regulate job contracting, DOLE is presumed to have acted in accordance with its mandate and after due evaluation of rules and regulations in its registration of CBMI.
    *   **Control:** CBMI exercised control over the respondents through hiring, payment of wages, discipline, and assigning tasks and locations. Reference to the "right of control" test outlined in DOLE DO No. 18-02, Series of 2002.

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** While CBMI could discipline employees (preventive suspension), the extended "temporary lay-off status" was deemed an illegal constructive dismissal because it exceeded the 30-day limit for preventive suspension under Section 4, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, and was not justified by a valid retrenchment/layoff, which requires prior notice to DOLE and must be for a period not exceeding 6 months. CBMI failed to provide evidence of reduced PPI demand.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **CBMI:** Liable to respondents for constructive illegal dismissal due to exceeding the allowed period of suspension without reinstatement or payment of wages.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Originally, the LA held PPI solidarily liable with CBMI. However, SC only reinstated NLRC's finding that CBMI is liable for the money claims of respondents Rolando Asprec, Jr. and Jonalen Bataller.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Lay-off Status":** The use of "temporary lay-off status" was contentious. CBMI's justification for the suspension was weak, as it appeared to be motivated by the theft incident rather than legitimate economic factors. *Sebuguero, et al. v. NLRC* (318 Phil. 635 (1995)) and Article 286 of the Labor Code were cited in this regard.
*   **Compliance with DOLE Regulations:** The decision highlights the importance of compliance with DOLE regulations regarding job contracting, specifically DOLE DO No. 18-02 and DOLE D.O. No. 18-A, series of 2011.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines (Article 106, Article 286/301):** Regarding labor-only contracting and suspension of business operations.
*   **DOLE DO No. 18-02, Series of 2002:** Implementing rules on job contracting.
*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code (Rule XIV, Section 4):** Limits on preventive suspension.
*   ***Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. v. Agito, et al.*** (598 Phil. 909 (2009)): Factors for determining independent contractor status.
*   ***Norkis Trading Co., Inc. v. Gnilo*** (568 Phil. 256 (2008)): Requirements for legitimate job contracting.
*   ***Almeda, et al. v. Asahi Glass Philippines, Inc.*** (586 Phil. 103 (2008)): Control test.
*   ***Sebuguero, et al. v. NLRC*** (318 Phil. 635 (1995)): Definition of lay-off/retrenchment.
*   ***Leo V. Mago and Leilani E. Colobong v. Sunpower Philippines Manufacturing Limited*** (G.R. No. 210961, January 24, 2018): Relevant in reiterating the role of DOLE with respect to regulatory mandate and its compliance.

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

The SC overturned the CA, holding CBMI liable for *constructive illegal dismissal*. CBMI was deemed an independent contractor, not a labor-only contractor, due to its capitalization, independent business operations, and DOLE registration. However, the extended suspension of the respondents exceeding 30 days without due process or proper justification constituted illegal constructive dismissal. *While CBMI had the power to discipline, its actions violated labor regulations.* Monetary claims were upheld, and the respondents are entitled to interest on the monetary awards at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. Focus on the "control test," the importance of DOLE registration, and the proper implementation of lay-off procedures. The ambiguity surrounding the "lay-off status" significantly contributed to the court's finding of illegal constructive dismissal.
