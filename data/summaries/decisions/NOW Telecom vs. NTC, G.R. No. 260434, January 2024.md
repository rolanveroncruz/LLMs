**Case Summary: *NOW Telecom Company, Inc. vs. National Telecommunications Commission***

**Legal Issue:** Propriety of the denial of NOW Telecom's application for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) against the NTC to restrain implementation of NTC M.C. No. 09-09-2018 ("Rules and Regulations on the Selection Process for a New Major Player in the Philippine Telecommunications Market").

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied NOW Telecom's Petition, affirming the CA decision which upheld the RTC's denial of the WPI.

**Key Provisions Challenged:**
*   **Section 6.2(j):**  Participation Security of PHP 700,000,000.00.
*   **Section 11:** Performance Security of 10% of remaining Capital and Operational Expenditure.
*   **Section 8:** Non-refundable filing fee of PHP 10,000,000.00 for appeals.
*   **Section 10.1:** Submission of Business and Roll-out plans after NMP determination.
*   **Section 3:** Covered and contingent radio frequencies to be assigned to the NMP.

**Core Arguments:**
*   **NOW Telecom:** Argued it had a clear legal right by virtue of its legislative franchise to be assigned sufficient radio frequencies and that the NTC's regulations were excessive, confiscatory, and violated due process.  Contended R.A. 8975 was inapplicable.
*   **NTC:**  Contended the WPI was prohibited by R.A. 8975 (prohibiting injunctions against government projects), would constitute a prejudgment, and that NOW Telecom failed to prove the requisites for a WPI. Asserted a legislative franchise does not guarantee a specific radio frequency.

**Key Holdings & Rationale:**

1.  **Mootness:**  The selection of Mindanao Islamic Telephone Company, Inc. (MISLATEL) as the NMP and the issuance of a CPCN rendered the WPI application moot and academic, as the act sought to be restrained had already occurred. Cites *Go v. Looyuko, 563 Phil. 36, 68 (2007)* and *Co, Sr. v. The Philippine Canine Club, Inc., 759 Phil. 134, 143 (2015)*.
2.  **Prohibition Under R.A. 8975:**  Section 3 of R.A. 8975 prohibits lower courts from issuing injunctions against the government regarding bidding or awarding of national government projects. The Court found the selection process for the NMP to be a "related and necessary activity" for the telecommunications sector, which is considered national infrastructure under *A.O. No. 11, s. 2018* and *Section 2(e) of Republic Act No. 11659*. Cites *Department of Foreign Affairs v. Falcon, 644 Phil. 105, 142 (2010)*.
3.  **Failure to Establish Requisites for WPI:** Even if R.A. 8975 did not apply, NOW Telecom failed to establish the requisites for a WPI under Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:
    *   **No Clear and Unmistakable Right:** The grant of a legislative franchise does not automatically confer a right to specific radio frequencies.  Radio frequency usage is a privilege, not a right, subject to compliance with laws and regulations. Cites *Liberty Broadcasting Network, Inc. v. Atlocom Wireless System, Inc.*, 762 Phil. 210 (2015). The Court noted that the "radio spectrum is a finite resource" that is part of the national patrimony and the use thereof is a privilege conferred upon the grantee by the State and may be withdrawn at any time after due process citing *Section 7 of Republic Act No. 10972*.
    *   **NTC Authority:** NTC has the authority to allocate and assign radio frequencies per *Republic Act No. 7925* and the franchise itself acknowledges NTC's regulatory power.
    *   NOW Telecom was a mere prospective bidder and had not shown compliance with the Circular's requirements.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "National Government Project":** The Court's expansive interpretation of "other related and necessary activities" under Section 2(a) of R.A. 8975 to include the selection process for the NMP could potentially broaden the scope of projects shielded from injunctive relief.

**Conclusion:**  The Supreme Court emphasized the government's authority to regulate telecommunications, the limited nature of rights conferred by legislative franchises, and the prohibition on lower courts interfering with national government projects through injunctive relief. The precedent strengthens NTC's regulatory authority in assigning radio frequencies and selecting telecommunications providers.
