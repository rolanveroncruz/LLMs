## Legal Document Summary: *Colegio Medico-Farmaceutico v. Lily Lim* (G.R. No. 212034)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Issue:** Validity of ejectment action filed by Colegio Medico-Farmaceutico de Filipinas, Inc. against Lily Lim. Focus on the validity of the demand letter and the authority of the corporation president to act.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, reinstating the Regional Trial Court's order for Lim to vacate the property and pay damages. The Court held that the president of a corporation (Del Castillo) can sign verification and certification against non-forum shopping without a board resolution. Crucially, the Court found the demand letter was validly issued by the president, even without express board authorization, because it was within the scope of his usual duties (collecting rentals).  Even if the demand letter was unauthorized, the subsequent Board Resolution ratified it.  All elements of unlawful detainer are present.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Existence of a lease agreement between Colegio (lessor) and St. John (later assigned to Lim). The lease term initially ran from June 2005-May 2006.
*   **Demand Letter:** Dr. Del Castillo sent a demand letter on March 5, 2008, demanding payment of back rentals and for Lim to vacate. This is a key element for unlawful detainer.
*   **Unpaid Rentals:** Lim's failure to pay rentals is a breach of the lease agreement.
*   **Possession:** Lim continued to possess the property after the alleged expiration/termination of the lease.
*   **Eviction Order:** The Supreme Court ultimately orders the respondent to vacate the premises.
*   **Damages:** Respondent is ordered to pay unpaid utility bills, reasonable rent (increased to P55,000/month), attorney's fees, and legal costs.
*   **Interest:** Actual damages will accrue interest from March 5, 2008 - June 30, 2013 at 12% per annum and from July 1, 2013 at 6% per annum, until fully satisfied.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lily Lim:** Liable for eviction, unpaid rentals, utility bills, reasonable rent, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Term of Lease:** There is a dispute over the length of the lease. The Colegio argues it was a one-year lease renewed for a period of June 2005-May 2006, whereas Lim claims a 10-year lease from 2003-2013 existed through an assignment of rights. The Court found there was no validity to the 10-year lease claim.
*   **Authority of President:** The core dispute centered on whether Dr. Del Castillo had the authority to issue the demand letter without an explicit board resolution.  While the Supreme Court sided with Colegio, the argument could have gone the other way depending on the interpretation of the corporate bylaws and usual course of business.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 23:**  Governs the powers of the Board of Directors.
*   ***People's Aircargo and Warehousing Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals***:  Cited extensively regarding the implied authority of a corporate president to act within the scope of their usual duties. This case provides the core rationale for upholding the validity of the president's actions.
*   ***Dela Cruz v. Court of Appeals***: This case reiterates the essential requisites of an unlawful detainer.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames***: Citation regarding the changing rates of legal interest.

**Conclusion/Assessment:** The Supreme Court's decision hinges on the broad interpretation of the president's implied authority under *People's Aircargo*. This case highlights the importance of clear corporate governance and delegation of authority through board resolutions. While the Colegio prevailed, the absence of a board resolution initially caused legal challenges.
