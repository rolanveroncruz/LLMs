## Legal Document Summary: *Zenaida V. Sazon vs. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 150873)*

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45. Affirms with Modification

**Core Issue:** Whether Zenaida V. Sazon, a Senior Forest Management Specialist of DENR, is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Robbery Extortion under Articles 293 and 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *affirmed with modification* the Sandiganbayan's decision finding Sazon guilty of Robbery Extortion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Elements of Robbery:** Establishes the elements of robbery as (a) personal property belonging to another, (b) unlawful taking, (c) intent to gain, (d) violence or intimidation of persons. Prosecution sufficiently proved this beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Intimidation:** Defines intimidation as unlawful coercion, extortion, duress, putting in fear. The Court found that Sazon's position at the DENR, her threats of confiscation and prosecution, and her demand for P100,000.00 constituted intimidation of R&R Shipyard, which was represented by Atty. Agbi.
*   **Unlawful Taking:** Sazon unlawfully took 100,000 pesos from R&R by threatening prosecution.
* **Abuse of Public Position (Aggravating Circumstance):** Although not considered by the Sandiganbayan, the Supreme Court determined that this was an aggravating circumstance due to Sazon exploiting her official role at DENR to facilitate the crime.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Found guilty of Robbery Extortion, sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term of Two (2) Years, Ten (10) Months and Twenty-One (21) Days of prision correccional, as minimum, to Eight (8) Years and Twenty-One (21) Days of prision mayor, as maximum. (Modified from previous sentence)
*   **Costs:** Sazon is required to pay the costs of the proceedings.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** Sazon argued the absence of intimidation and denied the prosecution's version of events. However, the SC upheld the Sandiganbayan's factual findings as supported by evidence.
*  **Discrepancies:** Sazon offered 25,000 for Agbi's work, which shows that she did indeed intend to take the money, regardless of what she said.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Articles 293 & 294(5), Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines Robbery and its penalties.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari (only questions of law may be raised).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in determining the penalty.
*   **People v. Francisco (45 Phil. 819):** Similar case involving a sanitary inspector demanding payment under threat of prosecution.
*   **United States v. Sanchez (26 Phil. 83):** Similar case involving police officers demanding money under threat of prosecution.
*   **Fortuna v. People (401 Phil. 545) & Pablo v. People (G.R. No. 152481):** Recent cases involving similar fact patterns and conviction of accused on Robbery Extortion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original issue of the type of wood in question may be questioned, and that is one defense that can be used in the future if something similar happens again.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC upheld the Sandiganbayan's decision, emphasizing the established facts showing Sazon's abuse of her position and the intimidation she employed to extort money from R&R. The factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, the application of Article 294(5) RPC, and the aggravating circumstance of abuse of public position, were all upheld and considered determinative in finding the elements of robbery with intimidation.
