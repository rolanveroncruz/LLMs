## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lusabio, Jr. (G.R. No. 186119, October 27, 2009)

**Type:** Criminal Case - Murder Conviction Appeal

**Case Summary:** The accused-appellant, Pablo Lusabio, Jr., appeals his conviction for murder of Edwin Labini, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, stemming from a stabbing incident. The RTC convicted Lusabio based primarily on the testimony of the victim's wife, Doris Labini, finding her a credible witness. Lusabio claims insufficient evidence and attacks the credibility of prosecution witnesses. He also claims to have been a victim of attempted murder himself on the same night.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Murder Charge (Crim. Case No. 01-459):** Lusabio found guilty of murder due to the treachery involved in the stabbing of Edwin Labini.
*   **Attempted Murder Charge (Crim. Case No. 01-464):** Tomasito de los Santos (co-accused) was acquitted of the attempted murder of Pablo Lusabio, Jr.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' finding that Doris Labini, the victim's wife, was a credible witness, despite her relationship to the victim. Mere relationship does not impair credibility, especially when no ill motive is proven.
*   **Defense of Denial/Alibi:** Lusabio's denial and alibi were rejected in light of the positive identification by Doris Labini and corroboration by Tomasito de los Santos (albeit with minor inconsistencies). Ricardo Cabrera's testimony, intended to corroborate Lusabio's version, was deemed incredible by the trial court and CA.
*   **Treachery:** The Court found the killing was committed with treachery, qualifying it as murder. The sudden and unexpected attack on an unarmed victim, depriving him of any chance to defend himself, constitutes treachery. *People v. Villonez, 359 Phil. 95, 112 (1998)* cited to support treachery even with possible forewarning.
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court modified the CA decision regarding damages.
    *   Civil indemnity: P50,000 affirmed.
    *   Actual damages: Replaced with Temperate Damages of P25,000.
    *   Moral damages: P50,000 affirmed.
    *   Exemplary damages: Awarded P30,000 due to the presence of treachery, aligning with Art. 2230 of the Civil Code and the *People v. Abolidor* ruling.*467 Phil. 709, 722 (2004).*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Pablo Lusabio, Jr.: Found guilty of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua.* He is obligated to pay civil indemnity, temperate, moral, and exemplary damages.
*   State: To ensure the safety and welfare of its citizens by enforcing justice for victims of crime.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Single Witness:** The conviction relies heavily on the testimony of Doris Labini, the victim's wife. Although her testimony was deemed credible, dependence on a single witness, particularly one with emotional ties to the victim, can be a point of contention.
*   **Dissenting Opinion (ABAD, J.):** Justice Abad dissents, questioning the credibility of Doris Labini's testimony based on inconsistencies and improbabilities, highlighting that her testimony should be scrutinized heavily.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies:** While the Court dismissed the inconsistencies between the testimonies of Doris Labini and Tomasito de los Santos as minor, these could be exploited to cast doubt on the prosecution's case. The inconsistencies include:
    * Tomasito De Los Santos claimed he went outside after hearing Doris shout "Enough of that," after which Tomasito saw Pablo Lusabio, Jr. stab Edwin Labini
*   **Attempted Murder of Lusabio:** While the RTC didn't discount entirely the possibility that the other accused Ronnie Dig had inflicted the wounds on the person of Lusabio, the court found the prosecution's evidence insufficient to show that Tomasito de los Santos had anything to do with the infliction of said wounds.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 63(2) (Application of Indivisible Penalties)
*   Civil Code, Art. 2230 (Exemplary Damages)
*   Civil Code, Art. 2224 (Temperate Damages)
*   Republic Act No. 7659 (Imposing Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimes)
*   *People v. Villonez, 359 Phil. 95, 112 (1998)* (Treachery)
*   *People v. Abolidor, 467 Phil. 709, 722 (2004)* (Exemplary Damages)
*   *People v. Rodrigo, G.R. No. 176159, September 11, 2008* (Credibility of Widow)
*   *People v. Romero, 459 Phil. 484, 499 (2003).* (Relationship to Victim does not Impair Credibility)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Lusabio's conviction for murder, upholding the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, particularly the victim's wife, and finding the defense's arguments unpersuasive. The presence of treachery was a key factor in the conviction. However, the dissenting opinion raises valid points regarding the reliance on a single emotionally connected witness, potentially creating grounds for further legal challenges. It might be crucial to analyze Doris' credibility further, considering the inconsistencies and the potential for bias, as noted by the dissenting justice.
