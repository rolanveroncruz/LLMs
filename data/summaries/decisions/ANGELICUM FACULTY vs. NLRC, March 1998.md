Here's a summary of the *Angelicum Faculty and Employees Association vs. National Labor Relations Commission* case:

**Case:** *Angelicum Faculty and Employees Association (AFEA) vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Angelicum School, Inc. (ASI)*, G.R. No. 121304, March 19, 1998.

**Summary:** This case concerns a dispute over the distribution of tuition fee increases and emergency tuition fee assessments (ETFA) collected by Angelicum School, Inc. (ASI) in school year 1991-1992 following Wage Orders NCR-01 and NCR-02 which mandated wage increases. AFEA, the union, argued that ASI failed to properly distribute 70% of the tuition fee increase to its members, as required by R.A. No. 6728, and the CBA between the parties. ASI contended that it had already complied by granting salary increases, including those mandated by the wage orders and included the ETFA in its computation.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **R.A. No. 6728, Sec. 5(2):** Mandates that 70% of tuition fee increases shall go to salaries, wages, allowances, and other benefits of teaching and non-teaching personnel (excluding principal stockholder-administrators).
*   **CBA, Art. X, Sec. 3:** Stipulates that any tuition fee increase approved by the DECS shall be treated per the DECS memorandum/circular, and the portion allotted for salary increase shall be distributed in the ratio of 75:25.
*   **CBA, Art. X, Sec. 4:** Any government-mandated salary or wage increase approved during the life of the agreement shall be implemented per its implementing rules/guidelines. ASI argued this section was applicable.
*   **DECS Order No. 30, Series of 1991:** Provided guidelines for tuition fee increases in response to regional wage orders. Schools were given authority to increase tuition fees based on the prescribed rates.
*   **AFEA's Position:** The union claimed it was entitled to 70% of the prescribed tuition fee increase (P763,021.88), or P534,115.32, in addition to the ETFA collection, and that wage order increases should not be credited against this 70% share.
*   **ASI's Position:** The school argued that DECS Order No. 30 authorized the tuition fee increase to mitigate the effects of the wage orders, and the total salary increases granted (including the wage order increases) exceeded 70% of the combined tuition fee increase and ETFA collections.

**Legal Issues and Holdings:**

*   **Crediting Wage Order Increases:** The core issue was whether ASI could credit wage increases mandated by Wage Order NCR-02 against the 70% of the tuition fee increase due to employees under R.A. 6728.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** The NLRC agreed with ASI that DECS Order No. 30 allowed for crediting the wage increases against the 70% share, but excluded the increase of CBA adjustment, re-ranking, change in pay class and SSS/PERAA/MEDICARE.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC's decision with modifications. The Court held that, based on the text of DECS Order No. 30, schools could increase their tuition fee rates in consideration of the regional wage orders, and crediting the wage increase to the 70% share of the employees was proper. The Court pointed out that Wage Orders NCR-01 and NCR-01-A allowed schools to credit the wage increase to the share of tuition fee increase that may have been effected for school year 1990, but this provision could not be found in Wage Order NCR-02. The Court ultimately computed a slightly lower amount due to a mathematical error in the NLRC's computation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of DECS Order No. 30:** The interpretation of DECS Order No. 30 is crucial. The Court sided with the school's broad interpretation, which allowed crediting wage increases against the 70% share.
*   **CBA Interpretation:** The CBA provisions were subject to differing interpretations. The union focused on the ratio for allocating tuition fee increases, while the school emphasized the provision regarding government-mandated wage increases.
*   **Conflict Between R.A. 6728 and DECS Order No. 30:** There is an implicit tension between the mandatory language of R.A. 6728 (70% "shall" go to employees) and the flexibility allowed by DECS Order No. 30, which the Court resolved in favor of the school.
*   **Compliance with Wage Orders:** Ensuring compliance with minimum wage laws and wage orders is a constant risk for employers. This case highlights the importance of clearly documenting how wage increases are allocated and justified.
