**Case Summary: People v. Cariat, G.R. No. 223565, June 18, 2018 (833 Phil. 345)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment finding Ron Aries Dagatan Cariat (Appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant was charged with rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, alleging he conspired with three co-accused (Magbanta, Pal, and Cutacte) to forcibly have carnal knowledge of the victim ("AAA").
*   **Prosecution's Version:** "AAA" testified that she was invited to a birthday celebration, became intoxicated, and was forcibly dragged to a secluded area by the accused.  Magbanta raped her while Appellant held her legs and pointed a knife at her, with Pal and Cutacte acting as lookouts.
*   **Defense's Version:** Appellant denied the events, claiming "AAA" voluntarily drank and later left with Magbanta.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Appellant guilty based on conspiracy, holding that his act of holding the victim's legs constituted direct participation in the rape.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's judgment.
*   **Issue on Appeal:** Whether Appellant was guilty of rape, specifically challenging the sufficiency of evidence regarding sexual assault, physical assault, and the existence of conspiracy.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Liability:**  The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding that Appellant conspired with the others to commit rape, even though he did not personally commit the act of penetration. As a conspirator, he is equally liable.
*   **Civil Liability:** Appellant is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. As per *People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016)*, because only *reclusion perpetua* was imposed and no ordinary aggravating circumstances were present, the civil indemnity and moral damages were both increased to P75,000, and an additional P75,000 of exemplary damages was imposed. All damages incur interest at 6% per annum from finality of the decision.
*    **Obligation to Pay:**  The Court ordered Appellant to pay the victim "AAA" civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
    *   **Civil indemnity:** P75,000.00
    *   **Moral damages:** P75,000.00
    *   **Exemplary damages:** P75,000.00
    *   **Interest rate:** 6% per annum

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Conspiracy:**  The court found conspiracy based on circumstantial evidence, specifically the Appellant's actions in restraining the victim and holding her legs during the rape. Challenges could be made regarding the interpretation of these actions as demonstrative of a pre-existing agreement or common design.
*   **Credibility of Witness:**  The conviction heavily relies on the testimony of the victim. While the lower courts' assessment of credibility is generally upheld, potential exists to challenge witness credibility if new evidence emerges or flaws in testimony are identified.
*   **Fugitive Co-Accused:** The fact that the other co-accused are fugitives may complicate enforcement of any potential restitution or contribution claims.
*   **No Physical Evidence Presented.** This case relied heavily on testimonial evidence alone, therefore subject to credibility.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape.
*   ***People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016)***:  Dictates the amounts of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages for rape convictions resulting in *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Conspiracy:**  The court's definition of conspiracy relies on established jurisprudence regarding common design towards an unlawful purpose *People v. Hidalgo. 768 Phil. 355, 364 (2015).*

**Conclusion:**

Appellant's conviction for rape was upheld based on the testimony of the victim and the finding of conspiracy. The court increased the amount of damages to reflect jurisprudence regarding the imposition of *reclusion perpetua*. The primary legal risks involve the subjective interpretation of circumstantial evidence regarding conspiracy and reliance of testimonial evidence.
