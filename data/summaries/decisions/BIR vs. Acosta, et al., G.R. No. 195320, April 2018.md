**Legal Document Summary: *Bureau of Internal Revenue v. Hon. Ernesto D. Acosta, et al. and Chevron Philippines, Inc.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 195320, April 23, 2018

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision dismissing a Petition for Certiorari filed by the BIR against Resolutions of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) Special First Division.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Issue:** Chevron claimed a refund for overpaid excise taxes on imported fuel. The CTA partially granted the claim, ordering the BIR to refund P108,585,162.95.
*   **BIR's Procedural Errors:** The BIR filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the CTA decision, but Chevron argued it was *pro forma* due to the BIR's failure to comply with Sections 3 & 6, Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of the CTA, specifically regarding the notice of hearing.
*   **CTA Rulings:** The CTA-Special First Division deemed the BIR's Motion for Reconsideration a "mere scrap of paper" due to the procedural defect and declared its original decision final and executory. The BIR's subsequent Motion for Reconsideration was also denied.
*   **BIR's Strategy:** Instead of appealing to the CTA En Banc, the BIR filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court, arguing grave abuse of discretion by the CTA-Special First Division.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **Supreme Court Dismissal:** The Supreme Court dismissed the BIR's Petition for Certiorari.
*   **Improper Remedy:** Certiorari is a remedy of last resort and not a substitute for a lost appeal. The proper remedy was an appeal to the CTA En Banc under Section 18 of RA 1125 as amended by RA 9282.
*   **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Supreme Court held that the CTA-Special First Division did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The CTA applied the applicable rules regarding motions for reconsideration, and the BIR failed to demonstrate capricious or arbitrary exercise of judgment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **BIR's Obligation:** The BIR is obligated to comply with the CTA's original decision to refund P108,585,162.95 to Chevron.
*   **Procedural Compliance:** Parties before the CTA are obligated to strictly adhere to the Revised Rules of the CTA regarding motions and appeals.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Traps:** Strict adherence to procedural rules in tax litigation is critical. Failure to properly file motions, including the notice of hearing requirement, can be fatal to a party's case. This highlights the importance of meticulous compliance with procedural rules and deadlines.
*   **Remedies and Timelines:** Understanding the hierarchy of remedies and the corresponding timelines is vital. Choosing the wrong remedy, like certiorari instead of appeal to the CTA En Banc, can result in the loss of the case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282:** Establishes the jurisdiction of the CTA. Section 18 specifically governs appeals to the CTA En Banc.
*   **Revised Rules of the CTA:** Governs the procedure before the CTA, including the requirements for motions for reconsideration (Sections 3 & 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court).
* **Gabutan v. Nacalaban, G.R. Nos. 185857-58, June 29, 2016:  Certiorari is a remedy of last resort.
* **Pahila-Garrido v. Tortogo, et al.,[30] 671 Phil. 320 (2011): Final Judgment disposes of the subject matter in its entirety.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision implies a strict application of procedural rules, leaving little room for leniency. This could be considered contentious by parties arguing for a more liberal interpretation of the rules in certain circumstances.
