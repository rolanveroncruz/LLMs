**Case:** *Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office v. Carolina A. Paumig* A.M. No. P-18-3882, December 04, 2018.

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Carolina A. Paumig, a Social Welfare Officer II in the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Tagbilaran City, for serious dishonesty relating to acts committed while she was a Municipal Social Welfare Development Officer in Corella, Bohol. The Public Assistance and Corruption Prevention Office (PACPO) charged her with misappropriating P107,550.00 in Self-Employment Assistance sa Kaunlaran (SEA-K) Loan Program funds.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Misappropriation of Funds:** Paumig admitted in a signed Agreement/Promissory Note that she received loan payments but failed to remit them, using them for personal consumption.  She later claimed the document was only for clearance purposes for her to transfer to the RTC.
*   **Admission:** The Supreme Court (SC) gives significant weight to the Agreement/Promissory Note where Paumig acknowledged the debt and the cause of action. The document was subscribed and sworn to before Mayor Tocmo.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) Decision:** The OMB-Visayas found Paumig guilty of serious dishonesty and ordered her dismissal. However, the OMB's authority to discipline ceases upon her employment with the judiciary. *RA 6770 Section 21* states the Office of the Ombudsman shall have disciplinary authority over all elective and appointive officials of the Government and its subdivisions, instrumentalities and agencies, except over officials who may be removed only by impeachment or over Members of Congress, and the Judiciary.
*   **Supreme Court Jurisdiction:** The SC asserts its plenary disciplinary power over court employees, regardless of when the offense was committed *Office of the Court Administrator v. Ampong, 735 Phil. 14 (2014)*.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended finding Paumig guilty despite the act occurring before her appointment to the judiciary.
*   **Restitution Irrelevant:** Paumig's alleged restitution of the funds and Mayor Tocmo acknowledging the payment does not exculpate her from administrative liability *Vilar v. Angeles, 543 Phil. 135, 144-145 (2007)*.
*   **Penalty:** While serious dishonesty warrants dismissal, the SC considered mitigating circumstances: first-time offender, acknowledgment of fault, and restitution. Instead of dismissal, the penalty was a fine equivalent to three months of her last salary, deducted from her retirement benefits.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Account for Public Funds:** Paumig had a fiduciary duty to remit collected funds to the Municipal Treasurer.
*   **Liability for Serious Dishonesty:** The SC found Paumig liable for serious dishonesty, a grave offense under *CSC Resolution No. 06-0538*.
*   **Financial Liability:** Although retired, she is penalized with a fine equivalent to three months' salary.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** Her argument that the Agreement/Promissory Note was for clearance only is likely barred by the parol evidence rule *Norton Resources and Dev't. Corp. v. All Asia Bank Corp., 620 Phil. 381, 389 (2009)*, which prohibits contradicting the terms of a written instrument with oral testimony.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While the SC acknowledges mitigating factors, the specific weight given to each might be subject to debate.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** Although the OMB decision was unenforceable, the fact that they came to a similar conclusion could be used as a basis for other similar complaints and investigations.
