Okay, here's a legal summary of *United Coconut Planters Bank v. Spouses Walter Uy and Lily Uy*, G.R. No. 204039, January 10, 2018, formatted in markdown:

**Case Summary: *United Coconut Planters Bank v. Spouses Uy***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the CA decision holding UCPB liable for the uncompleted Kiener Hills condominium project.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Uy entered into a Contract to Sell with Prime Town Property Group, Inc. (PPGI) for a condominium unit in Kiener Hills.
*   PPGI and UCPB entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Sale of Receivables and Assignment of Rights and Interests (AIR Agreement) to partially settle PPGI's loan with UCPB.  PPGI assigned its receivables from Kiener Hills unit buyers (including Spouses Uy) to UCPB.
*   PPGI failed to complete the project, and Spouses Uy filed a complaint with HLURB against PPGI and UCPB for sum of money and damages.
*   PPGI went into corporate rehabilitation, suspending proceedings against it.

**Procedural History:**

*   **HLURB Regional Office:** Suspended proceedings; held UCPB not solidarily liable.
*   **HLURB Board:** Reversed; held UCPB solidarily liable as PPGI's successor-in-interest, ordering refund, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Office of the President (OP):** Affirmed HLURB Board.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** Affirmed with modification. UCPB not solidarily liable, but liable *only* for amounts Spouses Uy paid after UCPB's assumption of receivables (April 23, 1998); cited its prior decision in *UCPB v. O'Halloran* (CA-G.R. SP No. 101699).

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the CA erred in applying the *stare decisis* doctrine based on the CA's own *O'Halloran* decision.
2.  Whether the CA erred in holding UCPB liable for amounts Spouses Uy did not pay the bank.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition, modifying the CA decision. UCPB is *jointly* liable with PPGI, but only for the amount *actually received* from the Spouses Uy, as proven by evidence.

**Rationale:**

*   ***Stare Decisis:*** The Supreme Court clarified that *stare decisis* applies only to Supreme Court decisions, not those of the CA. CA decisions only have persuasive effect. *De Mesa v. Pepsi-Cola Products Phils. Inc.,* 504 Phil. 685 (2005).
*   **Assignment of Credit:**  The MOA and AIR Agreement constituted an assignment of credit, not a full assumption of PPGI's obligations. UCPB acquired only PPGI's right to collect receivables, not the obligation to complete the project.  This interpretation is consistent with prior SC decisions: *Spouses Choi v. UCPB,* 755 Phil. 849 (2015), and *Liam v. UCPB,* G.R. No. 194664, 15 June 2016.
*   **Liability Limited to Actual Receipt:**  UCPB's liability is limited to the amount proven to have been *actually received* from the Spouses Uy. The Court found that only P157,757.82 was substantiated as received by UCPB through the demand letter reproduced in spouses' complaint, and ordered payment of this amount with legal interest. The burden of proof rests on the claimant. *Bognot v. RRI Lending Corporation*, 744 Phil. 59, 69 (2014)

**Key Provisions/Clauses of MOA/AIR Agreement:** Explicit exclusion of PPGI's liabilities and obligations under the individual contracts to sell, in favor of a transfer of receivables.

**Obligations/Liabilities:** UCPB has a *joint* liability with PPGI, but only for the amounts that UCPB can be proven to have actually collected from the Spouses Uy.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The document confirms the application of joint liability, emphasizing that liability cannot exceed what UCPB collected.
*   Risk remains for UCPB regarding potential future claims from other unit owners, and similar arguments being made in court based on assignment of receivables.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Article 8
*   *De Mesa v. Pepsi-Cola Products Phils. Inc.,* 504 Phil. 685 (2005) (Stare Decisis)
