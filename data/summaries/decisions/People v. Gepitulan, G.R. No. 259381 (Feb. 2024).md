## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Gepitulan, G.R. No. 259381 (2024)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Jonel Gepitulan for violating Section 16, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Planting and Cultivation of Marijuana). The Supreme Court GRANTED the appeal and acquitted the accused due to the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Sec. 16, Art. II of RA 9165 - Illegal Planting and Cultivation of Marijuana. The definition of "cultivate" is broad enough to include clearing land of underbrush and weeds.
*   **Warrantless Arrest & Search:** The prosecution argued the arrest was valid as *in flagrante delicto* due to the accused being observed clearing land around a marijuana plant. SC initially agreed that based on the testimonies, the accused was caught *in flagrante delicto* and a search incidental to a lawful arrest was valid; however, it later acquitted due to evidentiary issues.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, Art. II, RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):** This was the critical point leading to acquittal. SC found significant breaches in the chain of custody, specifically:
    *   **Marking & Identification:** The description of the marijuana plant differed between the letter-request, chain of custody form, and chemistry report. The inclusion of the weight ("15.9758g") was handwritten on the letter request for forensic examination of the specimen, and there was no record of who made this handwritten intercalation, when it was made, and why it was not indicated at the time that the letter-request was typewritten and prepared. Furthermore, the police officers did not testify to explain this handwritten annotation. No testimony was offered on whether the plant was placed inside a plastic bag.
    *   **Insulating Witnesses (Media & DOJ Representatives):** No media or DOJ representative was present at the *site* of seizure and inventory, despite time to contact them. The second inventory conducted at the police station with media representation was not substantial compliance as the law requires presence during inventory.
    *   **Barangay Official:** The barangay official was only "called in" *after* the arrest, violating the requirement of being readily available to witness the inventory.
    *   **Accused's Signature:** The Certificate of Inventory lacked the accused's signature, and no explanation was given for its absence or indication of a refusal to sign.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:** To prove each element of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including the identity of the seized substance (corpus delicti).
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Strict adherence to the chain of custody requirements in Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640.
* To prove justifiable grounds in non-compliance with Sec 21 Art II of RA 9165 as amended by RA 10640.

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC found Jonel guilty of violating Sec. 16, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165. He was sentenced by the court to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment and fine in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) Pesos.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidentiary Admissibility:** Failure to strictly comply with chain of custody rules can lead to the exclusion of evidence (i.e., the seized marijuana plant), as happened in this case.
*   **Wrongful Conviction:** Non-compliance with the law, coupled with weak justifications, can result in an unjust conviction, as the SC recognized here.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sec. 3(i) defines "cultivate or culture," Sec. 16 outlines the crime of illegal planting.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Sec. 21 of RA 9165, strengthening chain of custody requirements.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Rule 113, Section 5(a) (warrantless arrest - in flagrante delicto).
*   **Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 2:** Right against unreasonable searches and seizures.
*   **Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3(2):** Exclusionary rule (fruit of the poisonous tree).
*   **Hernandez v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 267 Phil. 806, 814 (1990):** Definition of "cultivation" includes clearing land.
*   **People v. Valdez, 395 Phil. 206 (2000):** Inadmissibility of evidence seized without a warrant where no in flagrante delicto exception applies.
*   **Nisperos v. People, G.R. No. 250927, November 29, 2022:** Requirements for insulating witnesses and inventory procedures.
*   **People v. Lim, 839 Phil. 598 (2018):** Mandatory policies on observance of Section 21, RA 9165, as amended (applied prospectively).
*   **People v. Tomawis, 830 Phil. 385, 409 (2018):** "Calling-in" insulating witnesses *after* an arrest is insufficient.
*   **People v. Manabat, 857 Phil. 250 (2019):** Consequences of missing signature on Certificate of Inventory.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Sec. 21. The prosecution's reliance on the area being "out of the way" was deemed insufficient by the SC.
*   The degree of effort required to secure insulating witnesses. The SC emphasized the need for "earnest efforts" beyond mere assertions of unavailability.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the critical importance of strict adherence to chain of custody requirements in drug cases, especially when relying on warrantless arrests. The prosecution's failure to adequately justify deviations from the law's mandated procedures, particularly the irregularities with marking of evidence and with obtaining insulating witnesses, created reasonable doubt and ultimately warranted the accused's acquittal.
