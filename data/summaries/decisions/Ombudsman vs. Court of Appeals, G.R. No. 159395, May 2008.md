**Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Court of Appeals and Dr. Mercedita J. Macabulos*, G.R. No. 159395 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision reversing the Ombudsman's decision to dismiss Dr. Macabulos from government service.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Ombudsman's Investigatory Power:** The document centers on the extent and limitations of the Ombudsman's power to investigate administrative offenses. It specifically addresses the interpretation of Section 20(5) of RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989) regarding the one-year prescriptive period for filing complaints.
*   **Finding of Guilt:** The Ombudsman found Dr. Macabulos guilty of dishonesty, falsification, grave misconduct, conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violation of office rules due to mishandling of a cash advance, submission of a tampered invoice, and a falsified affidavit.
*   **Penalty:** The Ombudsman imposed the penalty of dismissal from government service, carrying with it the cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits due to retirement), and perpetual disqualification for reemployment in government.
*   **Execution of Penalty:** The Supreme Court affirmed that the penalty of dismissal by the Ombudsman is immediately executory pending appeal, overturning the Court of Appeals' ruling.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dr. Macabulos:** Found administratively liable for the aforementioned offenses, leading to dismissal from government service, forfeiture of retirement benefits, cancellation of eligibility, and perpetual disqualification.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Section 20(5) of RA 6770:** The core legal issue is whether the one-year period in Section 20(5) of RA 6770 is a strict prescriptive period. The Supreme Court affirms that the use of "may" in the statute grants the Ombudsman discretion to investigate complaints filed beyond one year. This interpretation expands the Ombudsman's investigatory power, which could be viewed as a risk of potential overreach.
*   **Recanted Affidavit:** The reliance on the recanted affidavit of Dr. Dee is a potential point of contention. However, the Supreme Court emphasizes other substantial evidence, including the tampered invoice and Dr. Macabulos' reimbursement of the cash advance, as supporting the Ombudsman's findings.
