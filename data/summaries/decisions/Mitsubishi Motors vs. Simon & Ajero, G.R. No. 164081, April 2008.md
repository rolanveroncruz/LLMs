**Case Summary: *Mitsubishi Motors Phils. Corporation vs. Rolando Simon and Constantino Ajero***

**Facts:**

*   Rolando Simon and Constantino Ajero, union officers at Mitsubishi Motors Phils. Corp. (MMPC), were dismissed for allegedly extorting money from a rice supplier, Rodolfo Siena, in exchange for continued accreditation under MMPC's rice subsidy program.
*   Siena filed a sworn statement alleging respondents demanded and received P3,000.00, threatening loss of supply contract if he didn't comply.
*   MMPC conducted administrative hearings, found respondents guilty of serious misconduct and breach of trust under **Art. 282(a) and (c) of the Labor Code**, in relation to the company's rules.
*   Respondents filed for illegal dismissal. Labor Arbiter dismissed but awarded financial assistance. NLRC affirmed dismissal but deleted financial assistance.
*   CA reversed, ordering reinstatement with backwages or separation pay. MMPC appealed.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Just Cause for Termination:** MMPC based dismissal on **Art. 282(a) and (c) of the Labor Code** (serious misconduct/breach of trust), specifically alleging extortion which constitutes a crime (**Art. 315(2)(a) and/or Art. 318 of the Revised Penal Code**).
*   **Standard of Proof:** The core issue is whether MMPC presented *substantial evidence* to justify dismissal. CA erred in requiring a higher standard akin to proof beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The CA gave undue weight to self-serving letters from co-employees and criticized the lack of criminal charges. The Supreme Court stated that a criminal charge, let alone conviction, is not necessary to terminate an employee.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal of CA Decision:** The Supreme Court ultimately sided with MMPC, overturning the CA decision and reinstating the NLRC ruling upholding the dismissal of the employees.
*   **Financial Exposure (Potential):** Had the Supreme Court affirmed the CA, MMPC would have faced potential liability for reinstatement, backwages, and potentially separation pay if reinstatement was not feasible.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The ruling underscores the employer's right to terminate for just cause when supported by substantial evidence, even without criminal prosecution.
*   **Damages:** No other damages were mentioned in the decision.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 282(a) and (c):** Grounds for termination by employer (serious misconduct/breach of trust).
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 315(2)(a) and/or Art. 318:** Criminal provisions relating to Swindling or Estafa (extortion) and other deceits.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law.
*   ***Nuez v. NLRC (239 SCRA 518)***: Doctrine on separation pay for dismissals due to serious misconduct.
*   ***Salvador v. Philippine Mining Service Corporation (G.R. No. 148766)***: Defines substantial evidence in labor cases.
*   ***Nicolas v. NLRC (G.R. No. 113948)***: Distinction between proof beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases and substantial evidence in labor cases.
*   ***Ceballos v. Intestate Estate of the Late Emigdio Mercado (G.R. No. 155856)***: Testimony of a handwriting expert is just an opinion and is never conclusive.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity stemmed from the CA's interpretation of "substantial evidence" and its insistence on formal criminal charges. The Supreme Court clarified this by emphasizing that substantial evidence is sufficient and criminal charges are not a prerequisite.
*   The reliance on co-worker testimonies versus the victim's testimony creates a contentious evidentiary issue resolved in favor of direct testimony.
*   It is not explicitly stated what the company rules are only referenced. Par. E.(1) of the Company Rules and Regulation (CRR) for `Commission of an Act which is considered a crime under the Republic of the Philippines. This part would need to be determined to confirm that extortion is mentioned.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found that MMPC had substantial evidence to dismiss Simon and Ajero for serious misconduct and breach of trust due to their extortion activities. The CA erred in requiring a higher standard of proof and in disregarding the sworn statements of the complaining witness. This case reinforces the employer's right to terminate employees for cause, supported by substantial evidence, based on violation of company policy and commission of criminal acts.
