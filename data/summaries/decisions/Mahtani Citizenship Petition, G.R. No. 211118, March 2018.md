## Legal Document Summary: *Mahtani v. Republic*, G.R. No. 211118 (2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's grant of naturalization to Manish C. Mahtani.

**Key Provision:**  Section 2, paragraph 4 of Commonwealth Act No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law) requiring an applicant to have "some known lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation."

**Issue:** Whether Mahtani sufficiently proved that he met the requirement of having a lucrative trade, profession or lawful occupation under CA 473.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, denying Mahtani's petition for naturalization.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Strict Scrutiny:** Naturalization is a privilege and must be granted only upon strict compliance with the law.  Naturalization laws are strictly construed against the applicant.  *Lee Ng Len v. Rep. of the Phils., 121 Phil. 506, 509 (1965).*
*   **"Lucrative" Defined:**  A "lucrative" occupation means more than just covering ordinary necessities or luxuries. It requires an income that provides an appreciable margin over expenses, sufficient to provide adequate support in case of unemployment, sickness, or disability, preventing the individual from becoming a public charge. *Rep. of the Phils. v. Ong, 688 Phil. 136, 150-151 (2012).*
*   **Insufficient Evidence:** Mahtani failed to provide sufficient documentary evidence of his financial status to prove a lucrative occupation. His evidence primarily demonstrated his lifestyle and expenses, not the required margin between income and expenses.
*   **Inadequate Testimony:** Testimony from character witnesses regarding Mahtani's social life and business connections was deemed insufficient to prove a lucrative occupation as strictly defined by law.
*   **Belated ITR Submission:** Income Tax Returns (ITRs) submitted during the Motion for Reconsideration before the CA, while considered, showed an income that, when weighed against Mahtani's lifestyle, did not demonstrate a sufficient margin over expenses. Failure to file ITRs can be seen as not behaving in an irreproachable manner during the period of residency, based on  *Co v. Republic of the Philippines (1960)*
* Concept of a lucrative trade, profession, or lawful occupation in the contemplation of law speaks of adequacy and sustainability.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Lucrative":** The definition of "lucrative" is somewhat subjective and open to interpretation, leading to potential inconsistencies in application.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The strict burden of proof on the applicant for naturalization makes demonstrating "lucrative" status particularly challenging.
*   **Reliance on Documentary Evidence:** The Court's emphasis on documentary evidence over testimonial evidence creates a high evidentiary bar.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   Commonwealth Act No. 473, as amended (Revised Naturalization Law), Section 2, paragraph 4.

**Note:** The case underscores the stringent requirements for naturalization in the Philippines and the high evidentiary standard for proving a "lucrative" occupation.
