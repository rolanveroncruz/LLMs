**Case:** Securities and Exchange Commission vs. PICOP Resources, Inc. (G.R. No. 164314, September 26, 2008)

**Summary:**

This case concerns the correct filing fee for the amendment of PICOP's Articles of Incorporation (AOI) to extend its corporate term. PICOP paid based on SEC Memorandum Circular No. 2, Series of 1994 (P210.00), while the SEC initially assessed P12 Million, later reduced to P6 Million, based on RA No. 3531 (which prescribes the same fees for amended AOI as an original filing and a revised rate of 1/5 of 1% of the authorized capital stock) and the 2001 Circular. PICOP argued that RA No. 3531 was repealed and the 1986 Circular (1/10 of 1% of authorized capital stock, capped at P100,000) should apply. The Office of the President (OP) ruled in favor of PICOP, applying the 1986 Circular and ordering a refund. The SEC's appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA) was dismissed for being filed out of time after a prohibited second motion for reconsideration. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision and the OP ruling on the applicable filing fee.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Filing Fee for Amendment of AOI (Extension of Term):** The central issue is which SEC circular controls the filing fee: the 1986 Circular, the 1994 Circular, or the 2001 Circular, or whether RA No. 3531 applies.
*   **OP Order:** The OP ordered the SEC to refund the amount paid by PICOP exceeding P100,000.
*   **SEC's Obligation to Refund:** The SEC is obligated to comply with the OP's refund order, and the filing fee is capped at P100,000.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **SEC's Liability to Refund:** The SEC is liable to refund the excess filing fees paid by PICOP.
*   **Risk of Non-Compliance by SEC:** Failure to comply with the OP's order could lead to contempt proceedings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA No. 3531:** An Act to Further Amend Section Eighteen of the Corporation Law. The SEC initially relied on this act, which states that in case an amendment of the AOI consists of extending the term of corporate existence, the SEC shall be entitled to collect and receive the same fees collectible under existing law for the filing of AOI.
*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 139:** Authorizes the SEC to collect fees as authorized by law or by rules and regulations.
*   **Presidential Decree 902-A:** Reorganization of the Securities and Exchange Commission with additional powers and placing the said agency under the administrative supervision of the Office of the President (1976).
*   **SEC Memorandum Circular No. 1, Series of 1986:** Prescribes filing fees for amended AOI extending the term of corporate existence (1/10 of 1% of authorized capital stock, not less than P200 or more than P100,000).
*   **SEC Memorandum Circular No. 2, Series of 1994:** New Fees and Charges (2004).
*   **Administrative Order No. 18:** Prescribing Rules and Regulations Governing Appeals to the Office of the President of the Philippines (1987). It limits parties to one motion for reconsideration.
*   **Rule 43, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the CA. Section 4 limits parties to one motion for reconsideration.
*   **Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. v. International Communication Corporation,** G.R. No. 135992, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 163: (1) Whether the delegation of power was valid; (2) Whether the regulation was within that delegation; (3) Whether it was a reasonable regulation under a due process test.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Applicability of RA No. 3531:** PICOP argued it was repealed.
*   **Repeal of 1986 Circular:** The SEC contended the 1986 Circular was superseded by subsequent circulars.
*   **Publication and Effectivity of SEC Circulars:**  The SEC initially argued its 2001 Circular was published. The Court found the 1990 Circular was not properly filed with the UP Law Center, thus violating due process.
*   **Applicability of 1986 Circular versus general circulars**: The OP correctly applied statutory construction that a special rule (1986 circular) cannot be repealed, amended, or altered by a subsequent general rule (1994 or 2001 Circulars)

**Potential Risks & Litigation Strategy:**

*   **SC Confirmed OP jurisdiction**: The SC upheld that the OP has retained its appellate jurisdiction
*   **Procedural Lapse Fatal:** The SEC's failure to file its petition for review on time was a critical error, barring a ruling on the merits in the CA.
*   **SC Emphasized Compliance with procedural rules:** Procedural rules setting the period for perfecting an appeal or filing an appellate petition are generally inviolable

**Conclusion:**

The case confirms that the 1986 Circular governs the filing fee for extending a corporation's term, capping it at P100,000, and obligates the SEC to refund any excess payment by PICOP. However, there are implications for the SEC in terms of reviewing its regulatory procedures and compliance requirements.
