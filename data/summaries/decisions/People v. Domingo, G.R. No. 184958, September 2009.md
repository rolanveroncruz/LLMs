## Legal Document Summary: People v. Domingo, G.R. No. 184958 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Anthony Domingo for Murder with Frustrated Murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Anthony Domingo found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder with Frustrated Murder. Gerry Domingo remains at large and unarraigned, case against him archived.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Treachery and dwelling were present.
*   **Alibi Rejected:** Alibi that Anthony was at Alfredo Dalida's house was dismissed due to proximity to the crime scene.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Credence given to prosecution eyewitnesses Nida de Pedro Domingo, Leopoldo de Pedro, and Gina de Pedro, who positively identified Anthony. Minor inconsistencies in testimonies deemed immaterial.
*   **Motive Irrelevant:** Motive not essential for conviction due to positive identification of the accused.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (in lieu of death due to RA 9346).

**Obligations:**

*   Anthony Domingo is obligated to pay the heirs of Rosemelyn de Pedro:
    *   ₱75,000 civil indemnity *ex delicto* (increased from ₱50,000)
    *   ₱75,000 moral damages (increased from ₱50,000)
    *   ₱10,805 actual damages (supported by receipts)
    *   ₱30,000 exemplary damages (increased from ₱25,000)

**Liabilities:**

*   Anthony Domingo is liable for the death of Rosemelyn de Pedro.
*   Anthony Domingo is liable for the injuries inflicted on Vivian Domingo (frustrated murder).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Appellant argued the incredibility and self-contradictory nature of prosecution witnesses' testimonies. *Court found no reversible error in the lower courts' assessment of the credibility of the eyewitnesses.*
*   **Alibi Weakness:** Reliance on alibi is weak as Alfredo Dalida's house was only 200 meters away from the crime scene. *Court reiterated that accused should demonstrate that he was not at the locus delicti when the offense was committed and it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the approximate time of its commission*
*   **Gerry Domingo:** The unapprehended co-accused, Gerry Domingo, remains a potential risk. If apprehended, his case would be revived, potentially impacting Anthony's liability as a conspirator.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
