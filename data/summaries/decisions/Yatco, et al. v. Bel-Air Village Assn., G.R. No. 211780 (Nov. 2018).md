**Case Summary: *Cezar Yatco Real Estate Services, Inc. vs. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc.*, G.R. No. 211780, November 21, 2018**

**Legal Issue:** Whether Bel-Air Village Association (BAVA) validly extended the Deed Restrictions' term of effectivity beyond its original 50-year period via a majority vote of its members. Subsidiary issues include the validity of proxies used in the vote and the compulsory nature of membership in BAVA.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Deed Restrictions, Article VI (Term of Restrictions):** "The foregoing restrictions shall remain in force for fifty years from January 15, 1957, unless sooner cancelled in its entirety by two-thirds vote of members in good standing of the Bel-Air Association. However, the Association may, from time to time, add new ones, amend or abolish particular restrictions or parts thereof by majority rule."  This is the central clause under dispute.
*   **BAVA By-Laws:**  The document notes the existence of the BAVA by-laws, however the article does not define what the bylaws contain.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which upheld the validity of the term extension. The SC found that the BAVA members, by majority vote, validly extended the Deed Restrictions.

**Rationale:**

*   **Contract Interpretation:** The SC applied Article 1370 of the Civil Code (literal meaning prevails if terms are clear). It interpreted Article VI of the Deed Restrictions holistically, concluding that the "term of restrictions" is a "part" of the restrictions and thus amendable by majority vote. The intent of the parties was determined to be the creation of freedom for lot owners to protect their interests, as stated in the contract.
*   **Ayala Land's Confirmation:**  The SC considered the confirmation from Ayala Land, Inc. (Makati Development Corporation's successor), that it never intended to prohibit the extension of the Deed Restrictions, supporting the interpretation. This confirmation has raised potential Parol evidence concerns as Ayala Land was not a party to the original contract.
*   **Proxies:** The SC held that the proxies used in the special membership meeting were valid despite not being notarized. It gave weight to The Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68), Section 47 (4), which provides the By-Laws as the governing document. In absence of details or bylaws, Section 58 applies.
*   **Compulsory Membership:** The SC reiterated *Bel-Air Village Association, Inc. v. Dionisio* and *PADCOM Condominium Corporation v. Ortigas Center Association, Inc*, holding that compulsory membership in BAVA is valid due to the annotation on the land titles and that such membership does not violate the right to freedom of association, as membership was a condition of buying the property.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   **Definition of "Restriction":** The central argument revolved around whether the "term of restrictions" is itself a "restriction" that can be amended. While the SC ruled in the affirmative, this remains a potentially contentious point, as the petitioners had argued the term is a time frame and not a constraint on property use.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** The admission of Ayala Land's statement about the intent of the original parties raises concerns about the parol evidence rule (evidence outside a fully integrated contract not admissible to vary its terms). Petitioners highlighted this in their reply, as this statement impacts interpretation but was not part of the original agreement.
*   **Vagueness of "General Welfare":** The Deed Restrictions' stated purpose of promoting the "general welfare of the community" can be broadly interpreted, leading to potential disputes over the scope and application of the restrictions.
*   **Continued Enforceability:**  The decision seemingly indefinitely extends the restrictions, making them concurrent with the life of the Association. Whether or not the extension still constitutes a restriction.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1370:** Rules of contract interpretation.
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act), Section 39:** Binding nature of annotations on land titles.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 68 (Corporation Code of the Philippines), Sections 47(4) and 58:** Proxy requirements in corporate meetings.
*   ***Bel-Air Village Association, Inc. v. Dionisio*** (1989): Upholds compulsory membership in homeowners' associations and its limits on right of association.
*   ***PADCOM Condominium Corporation v. Ortigas Center Association, Inc.*** (2002): Affirms validity of automatic membership clauses.
*   ***Abad v. Goldloop Properties, Inc.*** (2007): Principles of contract interpretation.

**Obligations and Liabilities:** Lot owners in Bel-Air Village are obligated to adhere to the extended Deed Restrictions. Failure to do so may result in enforcement actions by BAVA, Makati Development Corporation, or other lot owners.

**Conclusion:** This case reinforces the principle that homeowners' associations have broad powers to regulate properties within their jurisdiction, provided such regulations are based on clear contractual provisions and do not violate fundamental rights. However, the court’s reasoning is potentially vulnerable on the parol evidence rule, and challenges based on a restrictive definition of property “restriction” may arise in future cases.
