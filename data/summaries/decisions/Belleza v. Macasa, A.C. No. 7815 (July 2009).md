### Legal Document Summary: *Dolores C. Belleza vs. Atty. Alan S. Macasa*, A.C. No. 7815, July 23, 2009

**Nature:** Disbarment case against Atty. Alan S. Macasa.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's finding of guilt. Atty. Macasa was found to have violated:
    *   Rule 1.01 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct).
    *   Rules 16.01 and 16.02 (failure to account for client funds and failure to keep funds separate).
    *   Rule 12.03 (failure to submit pleadings despite extensions).
    *   Canons 1, 7, 17, 18 and 19.
    *   Rules 16.01, 16.02, 16.03 and 18.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility
*   **Dishonesty and Professional Misconduct:** The court held Atty. Macasa guilty of dishonesty and professional misconduct for prejudicing Francis John Belleza's right to counsel and to bail under Sections 13 and 14(2), Article III of the Constitution.
*   **Disrespect for Legal Processes:** Atty. Macasa repeatedly ignored orders from the IBP-CBD to answer the complaint. Reference is made to *Sibulo v. Ilagan* (A.C. No. 4711) regarding the importance of complying with IBP orders.
*   **Gross Neglect of Client's Cause:** Despite accepting a retainer, Atty. Macasa failed to provide effective legal assistance to the complainant's son, essentially abandoning the case and violating Canons 17, 18, and 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Islas v. Platon, 47 Phil. 162 (1924) is referenced regarding the duty to provide competent and diligent representation.
*   **Failure to Return Client's Money:** Atty. Macasa failed to return P18,000 entrusted for a bail bond, and did not render services to earn the P30,000 in attorney's fees violating Rule 16.01. *Atty. Navarro v. Atty. Meneses III, 349 Phil. 520 (1998)* establishes the need to account for all money collected for/from the client.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:** Atty. Macasa is disbarred, effective immediately.
*   **Restitution:** Atty. Macasa is ordered to return P30,000 (attorney's fees) and P18,000 (bail bond money) to Dolores C. Belleza, plus 12% interest per annum from the date of the ruling until full payment.
*   **Proof of Payment:** Must submit proof of payment within 10 days. Failure to do so will subject him to criminal prosecution.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The court explicitly threatens criminal prosecution if Atty. Macasa fails to provide proof of restitution, potentially for estafa/swindling. *Pentecostes v. Ibañez, 363 Phil. 624 (1999)* is referenced.
*   **Enforcement of Restitution:** Enforcing the monetary judgment may require further legal action if Atty. Macasa does not comply voluntarily.
*   **Lack of Explanation from Respondent:** The court relies heavily on the complainant's account due to Atty. Macasa's failure to respond, which makes assessing alternative interpretations difficult.
*   **Interest Rate Ambiguity:** The 12% interest rate, though specified, is potentially subject to changes depending on prevailing legal rates for judgments.
