**Case Summary: *Ortega v. People*, G.R. No. 177944 (2008)**

This is a review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Judith P. Ortega for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code. Ortega was found guilty of defrauding Marilou Adorable of P27,450.00 by falsely representing herself as a real estate agent capable of transferring a tax declaration to Adorable's name without a deed of sale.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Estafa (Swindling) through False Pretenses under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Elements Proven:** The Supreme Court (SC) concurred with lower courts that prosecution proved:
    *   Ortega defrauded Adorable through deceit.
    *   Adorable suffered pecuniary damage (P27,450.00).
*   **False Pretenses:** Ortega misrepresented her ability to facilitate the transfer of a tax declaration and used this pretense to obtain money from Adorable. The offered tax declaration was later discovered to be fake.
*   **Credibility:**  The SC deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, finding no reason to overturn their findings.
*   **Defense Rejected:** Ortega's defense that the receipts were prepared to assist Adorable in managing debts was deemed illogical and unsupported.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Ortega is liable for the crime of Estafa.
*   **Indemnification:** Ortega is obligated to indemnify Adorable for the defrauded amount of P27,450.00.

**Penalties Imposed:**

*   Indeterminate Sentence of 1 year 8 months and 21 days of *prision correccional* as minimum, to 8 years of *prision mayor* as maximum.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Penalty Severity:** Ortega argued the 8-year sentence was too harsh and would make her ineligible for probation, impacting her dependent children. However, the court adhered to the *dura lex sed lex* principle, acknowledging the hardship but upholding the law.
*   **Review of Facts:** The petitioner attempted to argue facts that the appellate court already considered.
*   **Missed Witness:** Ortega complained that witness Lila Chin was not permitted to testify at the lower court trial.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315(2)(a):** Defines Estafa through false pretenses.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:**  Governs the imposition of indeterminate penalties.
*   **Bill of Rights, Section 14, paragraph 2 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution:** States that a defendant in a criminal action shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.
*   **Procedural Issues Regarding Factual Findings:**  The Court reiterated the general rule that appellate courts defer to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and factual findings, absent compelling reasons to overturn them (citing *People v. Agliday*, *People v. Canoy*, *Ibasco v. Court of Appeals*, *Ong v. People*, *People v. Vallador*, *Superlines Transportation Co. v. ICC Leasing & Financing Corp*, *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Elements of Estafa:** Dealt with cases *De la Cruz v. Court of Appeals*, *People v. Bautista*, *People v. Ong*, *Garcia v. People* and *People v. Balasa*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There is no significant ambiguity in the legal ruling, and the facts were generally agreed upon.
