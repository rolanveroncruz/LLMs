## Legal Document Summary - *Pag-Asa Fishpond Corporation v. Jimenez et al.*, G.R. No. 164912, June 18, 2008

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a dispute over a fishpond and claim for security of tenure.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Pag-Asa Fishpond Corporation (Landowner/Lessor)
*   **Respondents:** Bernardo Jimenez, et al. (Claimed Tenants of the Civil Law Lessee)

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Civil Law Lease:** Petitioner leased its fishpond to David Jimenez and Noel Hilario via a Contract of Lease. The term was for five years, commencing May 1, 1989, and expiring May 1, 1994.
*   **Prohibition Against Subletting/Assignment:** Paragraph 7 of the lease expressly prohibited subletting, allowing third-party occupation, or assignment of rights.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Respondents were hired by David Jimenez as farmworkers and shared in the fish harvests, claiming security of tenure under agrarian reform laws, specifically R.A. No. 6657 (CARL).
*   **Exemption Application:** Petitioner applied for and obtained an exemption from CARP coverage from DAR (Department of Agrarian Reform).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Lessee's Breach:** David Jimenez violated the lease by hiring respondents as farmworkers without the petitioner's consent.
*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** The petitioner had an obligation to pay the Real property taxes on the leased property
*   **Lessee's Obligation:** The lessees had an obligation to pay the Fees for business licenses and permits and other business taxes be due to the government from the operation of fishponds and saltbeds
*   **No Tenurial Obligation:** Petitioner has no tenurial obligations to the respondents

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Claims of Tenancy:** The central dispute revolves around whether the respondents are *de jure* tenants entitled to security of tenure.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The Supreme Court *motu proprio* raises the question of jurisdiction of the PARAD, DARAB, and the CA, given the exemption of fishponds from CARP coverage under R.A. No. 7881.
*   **Implied Consent/Estoppel:** The document notes *Joya v. Pareja* and *Ponce v. Guevarra* and mentions the principle of landowner consent by negotiating the lease, and estoppel in this type of agreement.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law - CARL):** The primary statute governing agrarian reform and the basis for the respondents' claim.
*   **R.A. No. 7881:** Amended R.A. 6657, expressly exempting private lands used for fishponds from CARP coverage, potentially depriving the DARAB and CA of jurisdiction.
*   **R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Provisions cited by DARAB regarding agricultural leasehold relations and parties thereto. Its application to fishponds is now superseded by R.A. No. 6657 as amended by R.A. No. 7881.
*   **Valencia v. Court of Appeals, 401 SCRA 666:** Key case cited by the petitioner, arguing that a civil law lessee cannot automatically create a tenancy without the landowner's consent.
*   **Sanchez v. Court of Appeals, 129 SCRA 717:**  Cited by the Petitioner and argues that the doctrine was only applicable to hired laborers of a civil law lessee, not to bona fide share or leasehold tenants.
*   **Romero v. Tan, G.R. No. 147570, February 27, 2004, 424 SCRA 108:** Held it was reversible error for the PARAB to have taken cognizance of petitionersâ€™ complaint.
*   **Joya v. Pareja, 106 Phil. 645 (1959)** Argued for extending the terms of the lease and negotiating for better terms with the tenants themselves. They were thus held in estoppel and the tenants considered de jure occupants.
*   **Ponce v. Guevarra, 119 Phil. 923 (1961).** See Argued for extending the terms of the lease and negotiating for better terms with the tenants themselves. They were thus held in estoppel and the tenants considered de jure occupants.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of R.A. No. 3844, Section 6:** The DARAB and CA interpreted this section as allowing a legal possessor (like the civil law lessee) to create a tenancy, which the Supreme Court rejects.
*   **Nature of Occupation:** The determination of whether respondents are truly *de jure* tenants or simply farmworkers hired by the lessee is a key point of contention.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and lack of merit. It held that fishponds are exempt from CARP coverage, that the civil law lessee was not authorized to create a tenancy, and that the respondents' claim of security of tenure was unfounded.
