## Legal Document Summary: *Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Excelsa Industries, Inc.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 152071, May 8, 2009 (605 Phil. 445)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Producers Bank of the Philippines (Bank)
*   **Respondent:** Excelsa Industries, Inc. (Excelsa)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC decision, thereby invalidating the extrajudicial foreclosure of Excelsa's properties by the Bank.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Excelsa executed a real estate mortgage with a "blanket mortgage clause" (dragnet clause) securing a P500,000 loan *and* future credit accommodations (including interest and expenses). Clause stated "as well as those that the MORTGAGEE may hereafter extend to the MORTGAGOR, including interest and expenses or any other obligation owing to the MORTGAGEE".
    *   **Issue:** Validity and scope of the "blanket mortgage clause" in relation to the subsequent export advances.
    *   **Ruling:** The Court affirmed the validity of dragnet clauses citing *Union Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 164910, September 30, 2005), allowing for the inclusion of future debts. The court applied the *Prudential Bank v. Alviar* doctrine (G.R. No. 150197, July 28, 2005) that mortgages securing future advances are valid. Court found the mortgage secured both the original loan *and* the unpaid drafts.

*   **Packing Credit Line & Export Advances:**
    *   Excelsa obtained a packing credit line from the Bank supported by a Letter of Credit (LC).
    *   The Bank purchased drafts drawn by Excelsa under the LC, providing export advances.
    *   The Korean buyer (Shin Sung) refused to pay due to discrepancies, and the export documents were returned to the Bank.
    *   **Issue:** Liability for the dishonored drafts/export documents and the Bank's responsibility as the negotiating bank under the LC.

*   **Respondent Undertaking:** Excelsa signed undertakings (dated 17 March 1987 and 10 April 1987) warranting the validity and acceptance of the drafts and promising to pay on demand any unpaid balance. It contained warranties "warrant that the said draft(s) and accompanying documents thereon are valid, genuine and accurately represent the facts stated therein, and that such draft(s) will be accepted and paid in accordance with its/their tenor"
    *   **Issue:** Validity and enforceability of the undertaking separate and apart from the dishonored LC.
    *   **Ruling:** The Court upheld the validity of the undertakings, relying on *Velasquez v. Solidbank Corporation* (G.R. No. 157309, March 28, 2008), holding Excelsa liable despite potential discharge under the Negotiable Instruments Law due to the separate contractual obligation of the undertaking. Liability subsists on the undertaking.

*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:**
    *   The Bank foreclosed on Excelsa's properties due to unpaid loans and export advances.
    *   **Issue:** Validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure, particularly concerning the required notice to Excelsa under paragraph 12 of the Real Estate Mortgage agreement.
    *   **Ruling:** The Court found the Bank complied with the requirement of sending notice by registered mail, as per paragraph 12, and did not have to ensure the actual receipt of notice.

*   **Notice Requirements:** Paragraph 12 of the Real Estate Mortgage requires notice to the mortgagor sent to a specified address.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Excelsa:** Liable for the underlying loans and the amount of the unpaid drafts based on the undertakings. Obligated to pay the amount of the drafts if dishonored.
*   **Bank:** Obligated to furnish notice of foreclosure sale as per the real estate mortgage; however, not obligated to ensure receipt of notice.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Blanket Mortgage Clause":** While the clause itself is valid, disputes may arise regarding *which* future obligations are truly intended to be covered. Is this ambiguous if not defined?
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law Considerations:** The Court sidestepped potential issues related to notice of dishonor and protest under the Negotiable Instruments Law (Sections 89 and 152) by focusing on the separate undertakings.
*   **Personal Notice of Foreclosure:** While the Court accepted the bank's fulfillment of the contractual notice requirement, future litigation might challenge the adequacy of simply *sending* notice versus ensuring *actual receipt*, especially considering constitutional due process concerns.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (Act No. 2031):** Sections 89 (Notice of Dishonor) and 152 (Protest).
*   **Civil Code provisions on mortgages.**

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the RTC decision, upholding the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure and granting the writ of possession to the Bank. The Court ruled that Excelsa was liable under the undertaking and the real estate mortgage covered the obligation to the drafts that were not accepted and paid.
