## Legal Document Summary: *Linda Uy Lim v. Helen O. Tong, et al.* G.R. No. 177656 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision on annulment of mortgage, injunction, and damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **SPA Granting Mortgage Authority:** Linda Uy Lim granted Philip Ong and Helen Tong the authority to mortgage property (TCT No. T-50103) to secure obligations and remit proceeds to them.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Helen Tong, as attorney-in-fact, executed a Real Estate Mortgage in favor of Propmech Corporation to secure a P1,000,000 obligation.
*   **Mortgage Condition:** Mortgage becomes null and void if P1,000,000 is paid by June 30, 1996, otherwise remains in full force.

**Obligations:**

*   **Mortgagor (Lim):** Obligation to repay P1,000,000 by June 30, 1996.
*   **Attorney-in-Fact (Tong/Ong):** Duty to act within the authority of the SPA.
*   **Mortgagee (Propmech):** Duty to release mortgage upon full payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lim:** Potential liability for the P400,000 Loan.
*   **Saturnino Lim:** Potential liability for the P600,000 Loan.
*   **Tong/Ong:** Potential liability for exceeding the authority of the SPA or breach of fiduciary duty.
*   **Propmech:** Potential liability for improper foreclosure.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fraud in SPA Execution:** Petitioner alleged fraud in obtaining her signature on the SPA.  Court finds no fraud because she is educated and admitted she signed it.
*   **Paraphernal Property:** Petitioner claimed the property was paraphernal and not liable for her husband's debt. Ruled as unnecessary to dwell on as court ruled the loan was from both parties.
*   **Ambiguous Debt:** The P1,000,000 obligation includes a P400,000 loan to the spouses and a P600,000 amount representing alleged defalcation by Saturnino. The court rules only valid for the initial loan.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** The P600,000 debt is not well-documented. Photocopies of Saturnino's letters admitting to taking company funds are considered inadmissible under Rule 130, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 130, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Inadmissibility of secondary evidence (photocopies) of document contents without proper foundation (loss/destruction of original, etc.).
*   *Heirs of Salvador Hermosilla v. Remoquillo, G.R. No. 167320, January 30, 2007, 513 SCRA 403, 412:* The Court cites that fraud must be specifically alleged and proven by clear and convincing evidence, and it is never presumed.
*   *Dalisay v. Mauricio, Jr., A.C. No. 5655, January 23, 2006, 479 SCRA 307, 316:* The Court cites that a party cannot change their theory in the later stage of the proceedings because it is against the rules of fair play, justice, and due process.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court **partially granted** the petition.
*   The Deed of Real Estate Mortgage is **valid only insofar as it secures the P400,000 loan** extended to the spouses.
*   The Deed of Real Estate Mortgage is **null and void** insofar as it secures the P600,000 allegedly representing Saturnino's personal obligation.

**Potential Arguments/Further Investigation:**

*   The SPA's wording regarding the remit of funds "to Philip L. Ong and/or Helen O. Tong" could suggest the money was for their benefit, not for loan to them.
*   Explore if the separation between the spouses could potentially affect their liabilities on the original Loan.
