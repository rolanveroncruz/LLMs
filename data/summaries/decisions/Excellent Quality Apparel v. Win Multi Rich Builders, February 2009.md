**Legal Document Summary: Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc. v. Win Multi Rich Builders, Inc., G.R. No. 175048**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision reversing the Court of Appeals' decision and annulling orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in a construction dispute case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Construction Contract:**  Agreement between Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc. (Owner) and Multi-Rich Builders (Contractor) for the construction of a garment factory.
*   **Arbitration Clause (Article XIX):** Mandates arbitration for disputes arising from the contract, to be governed by the Arbitration Law (R.A. No. 876).  Specifies a three-member Arbitration Committee with decisions being final and binding.
*   **Complaint for Sum of Money:** Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc. (Win) filed a complaint against Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc. seeking P8,634,448.20. Win also obtained a writ of attachment on the property of Excellent Quality Apparel.
*   **Dispute re: Legal Personality:** Excellent Quality Apparel challenged Win's legal standing to sue, asserting that the contract was with Multi-Rich Builders, a sole proprietorship and distinct from Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc. (Win), a corporation.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The decision addresses whether the RTC had jurisdiction given the arbitration clause and the fact that the lawsuit was filed by a party different than the one listed on the original contract.
*   **Disposition:** The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc. by dismissing the case, and ordered Win to return the garnished amount.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc.:** Ordered to return the garnished amount plus legal interest due to the absence of legal standing to file the complaint in the first place.
*   **Excellent Quality Apparel, Inc.:** No obligation to pay Win.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Assignment:** Absence of a formal assignment or transfer of assets/receivables from the sole proprietorship (Multi-Rich Builders) to the corporation (Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc.) is fatal to Win's claim. The court was emphatic that Win failed to present any evidence of such a transfer of assets.
*   **Arbitration Clause:** The presence of the arbitration clause mandated referral to the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) under E.O. No. 1008. The RTC lacked jurisdiction.
*   **Legal Personality of Plaintiff:** The legal personality of Win to file the suit was challenged, specifically that the Win wasn't a party to the original contract. The court found it cannot change the name of the plaintiff mid-trial from a corporation to a sole proprietorship, as a sole proprietorship does not have juridical personality.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Section 2 (Real Party in Interest):**  Cited regarding the requirement that a suit be brought by the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment.
*   **Mangila v. Court of Appeals:**  Emphasizes that a sole proprietorship does not have a separate juridical personality to sue or be sued.
*   **Executive Order No. 1008:**  Establishes the jurisdiction of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) over construction disputes.
*   **Republic Act No. 876:** Philippine Arbitration Law
*   **Republic Act No. 9285:** "Alternative Disputes Resolution Act of 2004," Section 39 further mandates the dismissal of cases involving construction disputes where an arbitration agreement exists.
*   **National Irrigation Authority v. Court of Appeals:** Jurisdiction of the CIAC acquires jurisdiction over a construction contract if the parties have an agreement for voluntary arbitration.
*   **LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc.:** Arbitration clause is binding and parties are expected to abide by it in good faith.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The identity and legal status of the plaintiff was highly contentious. The lack of clarity regarding the relationship between Multi-Rich Builders (sole proprietorship) and Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc. (corporation) was the central issue.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court decision is a strong affirmation of the importance of legal standing and adherence to arbitration agreements. Win Multi-Rich Builders, Inc. lacked standing to sue because it wasn't a party to the original contract and failed to demonstrate a valid assignment of rights.  The presence of a clear arbitration clause divested the RTC of jurisdiction, mandating referral to the CIAC. This case serves as a reminder of the need to properly document business transitions and respect contractual dispute resolution mechanisms.
