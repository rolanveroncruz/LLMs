## Legal Document Summary - *Normandy v. Cabailo* (G.R. No. 264268)

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the Court of Appeals (CA) and dismissing the complaint against Normandy.

**Issue:** Whether the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has jurisdiction over a complaint against an unlicensed contractor under Section 35 of the Contractors' License Law (RA 4566).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the DTI lacks jurisdiction; jurisdiction lies with the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board (PCAB).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 4566, Section 35 (Penalties):**  Criminalizes contracting without a license.
*   **RA 4566, Section 5 & 29 (Powers and duties of the Board, Jurisdiction):** Grants PCAB the authority to investigate actions of *any* contractor (licensed or unlicensed), and issue, suspend, and revoke licenses.
*   **PCAB IRR, Section 11.3:** Explicitly grants PCAB jurisdiction over offenses involving contracting without a license. The Supreme Court relies heavily on this provision.
*   **DTI Department Administrative Order (DAO) No. 07-06:** The CA and DTI relied on this order, asserting that engaging in construction without a license is a Trade and Industry Law violation, thus granting jurisdiction to DTI.
*   **Supreme Court Rationale:**
    *   The term "contractor" in RA 4566 encompasses both licensed and unlicensed individuals.
    *   The law doesn't distinguish between licensed and unlicensed contractors for investigative purposes.
    *   An administrative order (DTI DAO No. 07-06) cannot supersede a statute (RA 4566).  Administrative rules must be consistent with the enabling statute.
    *   Cited case law: *Department of Agrarian Reform v. Carriedo, 778 Phil. 656, 682 (2016)* and *Department of Agrarian Reform v. Uy, 544 Phil. 308, 330 (2007)* in support of above.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Normandy was found by the DTI to have violated RA 4566 and ordered to cease operations, have his business name registration cancelled or application withheld, and pay administrative fines (PHP 50,000 + PHP 1,000 per day of continuing violation).  This is now reversed.
*   Cabailo, as the complainant, is now left without an administrative remedy under the DTI.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Statute of Limitations:**  If Cabailo wishes to pursue the claim before the PCAB, she must ensure the statute of limitations has not run.
*   **Civil Liability:**  While the DTI matter is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, Normandy may still be exposed to civil liability for breach of contract or defective workmanship, subject to defenses and applicable laws.
*   **Conflicting Jurisprudence:**  The SC expressly notes there is a conflict between RA 4566 and DAO 07-06. There's the risk this ruling could be contested or distinguished in future cases with similar fact patterns.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "any contractor" in Section 29 of RA 4566 was the central point of contention. The CA narrowly interpreted it as only applying to licensed contractors, which the SC rejected.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, holding that the DTI lacked jurisdiction over complaints against unlicensed contractors, vesting that jurisdiction with the PCAB based on RA 4566 and its IRR.  The matter before the DTI is dismissed.
