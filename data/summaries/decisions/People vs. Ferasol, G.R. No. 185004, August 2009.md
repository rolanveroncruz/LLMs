**Case Summary: People vs. Ferasol, G.R. No. 185004 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of Appellant Armando Ferasol for Statutory Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** Ferasol was convicted of raping his 9-year-old niece, AAA. The prosecution's case rested primarily on AAA's testimony, alleging the rape occurred at Ferasol's house in August 2001. The defense presented alibi, with Ferasol claiming he was in another location.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, modifying the monetary awards. The court found AAA's testimony credible, despite minor inconsistencies, citing the vulnerability and age of the victim. Alibi was rejected.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Article 266-A, Revised Penal Code:** Defines statutory rape. Appellant is found liable under this provision.
*   **Testimony of Complainant:** The court emphasizes the importance of the complainant's credibility in rape cases, acknowledging the difficulty of proof and the potential for false accusations. Cited *People v. Brondial* and subsequent cases for the importance and scrutiny of the victim's testimony.
*   **Civil Liability:** Appellant ordered to pay civil indemnity (P75,000.00), moral damages (P75,000.00), and exemplary damages (P30,000.00) to the victim, AAA.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The Appellant attempted to raise inconsistencies as to the presence of witnesses and other secondary points in the victim's testimony to undermine her credibility; however, these inconsistencies were minor and adequately explained, not rising to the level to warrant reversal.
*   **Alibi Defense:** While rejected, the appellant presented an alibi which raised the question of his whereabouts on the day in question. The weakness of the evidence in supporting his alibi, coupled with the credible victim testimony, resulted in its proper dismissal by the Courts.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The court references established principles in rape cases, emphasizing the need for careful scrutiny of complainant's testimony (*People v. Abellano*).
*   The court cites jurisprudence regarding the effect of minor inconsistencies in a child witness's testimony.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines statutory rape, the crime of which the appellant was convicted.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610 and R.A. No. 9262:** Protect the identity of the victim and her family.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

* The main contention in the ruling is the appreciation of the victim's testimony in contrast to the defense's alibi.

**Note:** The Supreme Court modified only the monetary awards, increasing the civil indemnity and moral damages and reinstating exemplary damages, indicating the gravity of the offense and the need for full compensation and deterrence.
