**Case Summary: *Del Rosario v. People***

**Citation:** 834 Phil. 419 (G.R. No. 199930, June 27, 2018)

**Issue:**  Whether the prescriptive period for violations of Section 8 of R.A. No. 6713 (failure to file SALN) should be reckoned from the date of filing deadline (commission) or from the discovery of non-filing.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the prescriptive period begins to run from the date of commission (filing deadline) of the violation, *not* from the date of discovery. The Sandiganbayan's application of the "discovery rule" (blameless ignorance doctrine) was reversed.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards):** Section 8 requires public officials to file SALNs. Violation of this section is the basis of the charges. The law itself doesn't specify a prescriptive period.
*   **Act No. 3326 (Prescription for Special Acts):** Governs the prescriptive period as R.A. No. 6713 is silent on the matter. Section 1 provides an 8-year prescriptive period for offenses punished by imprisonment for two years or more, but less than six years (applicable to violations of R.A. No. 6713).
*   **Act No. 3326, Section 2:** Outlines two modes for reckoning the prescriptive period: (1) from the date of the commission of the violation (general rule) and (2) from the date of discovery of the violation (exception â€“ discovery rule).
*   **The Discovery Rule Exception:** Normally applies when the violation is concealed or information is suppressed, making discovery difficult.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **General Rule Applies:** The Court found that the "general rule" under Act No. 3326, Section 2 applied because the failure to file a SALN is *not* inherently concealed. SALNs are accessible to the public.
2.  **No Concealment:** Petitioner did not actively conceal her non-compliance, distinguishing it from cases where concealment or conspiracy prevented timely discovery.
3.  **Government's Duty:** The Court emphasized that the Ombudsman and Civil Service Commission (CSC) have a duty to monitor compliance with R.A. No. 6713.  Memorandum circulars issued by these agencies showed they had established procedures for monitoring SALN filings. Their failure to detect the violation within the prescriptive period was attributed to their own inaction.
4.  **Distinguishing Behest Loans Cases:** The Sandiganbayan incorrectly relied on cases involving "behest loans" where discovery was delayed due to the complex nature of the transactions and potential collusion. Those factors are not present in a simple failure-to-file scenario.
5. R.A. No. 3019 is not relevant.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Potential for Statute of Limitations Defense:** This case strengthens the statute of limitations defense in R.A. No. 6713 cases where the filing violation is readily ascertainable.
*   **Agency Accountability:** It emphasizes the responsibility of the CSC and Ombudsman to actively monitor SALN compliance and initiate actions within the prescriptive period. This case implies that agencies can't claim a lack of resources to justify delayed prosecution if the information was publicly available.

**Case Law Cited:**

*   **Benedicto v. Abad Santos, Jr. & People v. Monteiro:** Distinguished due to absence of concealment in *Del Rosario.*
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee v. Desierto (Behest Loans Cases):** Distinguished as those cases involved active concealment and government suppression, not present here.  These cases typically involved corruption and complex financial schemes.
*   **Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Carpio-Morales:** Provided guidelines for determining when the "discovery rule" applies in R.A. No. 3019 cases, which the Court applied to R.A. No. 6713.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "discovery rule" remains fact-dependent. While this case narrowed its application in SALN cases, the degree of effort required for discovery could still be a point of contention.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the importance of prompt action by government agencies in enforcing R.A. No. 6713. It clarifies that the statute of limitations begins running from the date the SALN was due, unless there is active concealment or suppression of information that prevents timely discovery, imposing more responsibilities to the Civil Service Commission and Ombudsman. The legal precedent of this case means that delayed investigation of SALN violations won't automatically be excused under the discovery rule.
