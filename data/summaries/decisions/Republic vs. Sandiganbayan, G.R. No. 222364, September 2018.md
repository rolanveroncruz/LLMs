**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan (Second Division) and BLMMM Ventures, Inc.* G.R. No. 222364, September 05, 2018.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing the Sandiganbayan's Amended Resolution and Resolution cancelling a Notice of Sequestration on titles held by BLMMM Ventures, Inc. (BVI).

**Background:**
*   Civil Case No. 0004 was filed by the Republic (through PCGG) against Andres Genito, Jr., Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos, et al., for recovery of ill-gotten wealth, specifically two parcels of land.
*   A Notice of Lis Pendens (later deemed a Notice of Sequestration) was annotated on the original titles. The initial Notice of Lis Pendens was lifted, but a subsequent "Notice of Lis Pendens" was issued on Asian Bank Corporation's (Asian Bank) titles after they acquired the properties.
*   BVI purchased the properties from a successor-in-interest of Asian Bank, obtaining new titles. A Notice of Sequestration was carried over to BVI's titles from Asian Bank's titles.

**Key Issue:** Did the Sandiganbayan commit grave abuse of discretion in ruling that the notice annotated on the titles was a Notice of Sequestration (requiring strict compliance with constitutional and PCGG rules) and not merely a Notice of Lis Pendens?

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's decision, dismissing the Republic's petition.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Sequestration vs. Lis Pendens:** The Court agreed with the Sandiganbayan that the notice, despite being labeled "Notice of Lis Pendens," operated as a *de facto* sequestration order.  It analyzed the *effect* of the notice, noting its directive to the Register of Deeds to prevent any disposition of the property, akin to a freeze order under Executive Order No. 2.
*   **PCGG Rules & Constitutional Requirements:** Because the notice was effectively a sequestration, it had to comply with Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution and PCGG Rules.
*   **Validity of Sequestration Order:**  The Court found the notice of sequestration void *ab initio* due to:
    *   Issued beyond the 18-month period following the ratification of the 1987 Constitution (expiring August 2, 1987).
    *   Issued by only one PCGG Director (Parras), not the required two Commissioners as mandated by Section 3 of the PCGG Rules.  *PCGG v. Judge Peña* (243 Phil. 93 (1988)) establishes that quasi-judicial powers cannot be delegated.
*   **Notice to the World:** A lis pendens serves the purpose of a warning to third persons that the property is subject to a pending litigation.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of Constitutional Requirements:** The decision potentially retroactively invalidates other similar PCGG actions taken after the initial 18-month period and not adhering strictly to the two-Commissioner rule.  This could expose other PCGG cases to challenges.
*   **Equitable Considerations:** The court’s focus was based on the purpose or intent of its issuance, rather than the description.
*   **Impact on Recovery of Ill-Gotten Wealth:** This case sets a higher bar for the PCGG's actions, especially regarding properties already transferred to third parties. *Republic of the Philippines v. Sandiganbayan,*(355 Phil. 181, 195-196 (1998)) states that since sequestration tends to impede or limit the exercise of proprietary rights by private citizens, it should be construed strictly against the State.
*   **Lack of Clarification:** The Republic should have asked the Register of Deeds to amend the annotation at a reasonable time after the annotation was placed, but the PCGG failed to do so.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Executive Order No. 1 (Creation of PCGG)
*   Executive Order No. 2 (Definition of Ill-Gotten Wealth; Powers of PCGG)
*   Section 26, Article XVIII, 1987 Constitution (Duration of Sequestration Power)
*   PCGG Rules and Regulations Implementing Executive Order Nos. 1 and 2
*   *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Hon. Sandoval*, 704 Phil. 98 (2013) (Jurisdiction of Sandiganbayan)
*    *Republic of the Philippines v. Sandiganbayan*, 355 Phil. 181, 195-196 (1998)
*   *PCGG v. Judge Peña*, 243 Phil. 93 (1988) (Non-Delegation of Quasi-Judicial Functions)
*   *Republic v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 88228, 27 June 1990, 186 SCRA 864, 871

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the need for strict adherence to constitutional and regulatory requirements when the government seeks to restrict property rights through sequestration. The ruling favors the third-party purchaser (BVI) and establishes stricter standards for PCGG actions, particularly those impacting property held by parties beyond the original Marcos circle. Counsel for the Republic should assess the implications for other pending cases and the validity of existing sequestration orders.
