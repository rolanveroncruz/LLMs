**Case Summary: Ang v. Court of Appeals and Soledad (G.R. No. 177874, September 29, 2008)**

**Facts:** Petitioner Ang and Respondent Soledad engaged in a car-swapping transaction evidenced by Deeds of Absolute Sale. Ang received a Mitsubishi GSR from Soledad, and Soledad received a Mitsubishi Lancer plus P55,000. Ang sold the GSR, but it was subsequently seized via a writ of replevin due to a prior owner's (Panes) unpaid mortgage debt to BA Finance. Ang paid BA Finance to release the vehicle and sought reimbursement from Soledad, which Soledad refused.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Soledad to Ang):** Contains a clause where Soledad covenanted his "absolute ownership...free from all liens and encumbrances" and promised to "defend the same from all claims."
*   **Warranties:** The main legal issue revolves around the nature of the warranty provided by Soledad. The court considered both implied (warranty of title and against eviction) and express warranties.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Soledad's Potential Liability:**  Ang argued breach of warranty. If an express warranty existed, Soledad could be liable for damages. Under an implied warranty, the action may have prescribed. The warranty against eviction also had specific requisites that Ang could not prove.
*   **Ang's Risk:** Ang bore the risk of loss due to the prior encumbrance. The Court of Appeals emphasized that as a used car dealer, he should have exercised due diligence in verifying the vehicle's title. Also, Ang's voluntary payment to BA Finance was seen as an assumption of risk.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:** Art. 1546 (express warranty), Art. 1548 (implied warranty against eviction), Art. 1561 (implied warranty against hidden defects), Art. 1571 (prescription for implied warranty actions), Art. 1144 (prescription on written contract), Art. 1389 (general rule on rescission of contract).
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:**
    *   *Goodyear Phil., Inc. v. Anthony Sy:* Regarding the prescriptive period for breach of warranty.
    *   *Engineering & Machinery Corp. v. CA:* Addressed the prescriptive period for breach of express warranty and the general rule of rescission.
    *   *Carrascoso, Jr. v. Court of Appeals:* Discussed the damages recoverable in case of breach of an express warranty.
    *   *Power Commercial and Industrial Corp. v. CA, et al.:* Defined requisites for breach of warranty against eviction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of the Warranty:** The primary point of contention is whether Soledad provided an express or implied warranty. The clause "I hereby covenant my absolute ownership...free from all liens and encumbrances and I will defend the same from all claims" is ambiguous. Ang argued for express warranty with a longer prescriptive period; Soledad and the CA argued implied warranty with a 6-month prescription.
*   **"Free from all Liens and Encumbrances" vs. Duty to Investigate:** While Soledad warranted the vehicle was free of liens, the court implied a duty for Ang, as a used car dealer, to investigate independently.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* Ang's petition. It agreed with the Court of Appeals that the action had prescribed because Soledadâ€™s warranty was considered implied, and the claim was filed beyond the six-month period prescribed by Art. 1571. Moreover, the requisites for a breach of warranty against eviction were not met.  The court also found that Soledad did not benefit from Ang's payment to BA Finance, negating any unjust enrichment.
