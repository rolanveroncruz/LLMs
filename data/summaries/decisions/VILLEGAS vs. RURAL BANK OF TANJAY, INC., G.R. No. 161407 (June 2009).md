Okay, here's a legal summary of *Joaquin Villegas and Emma M. Villegas vs. Rural Bank of Tanjay, Inc.*, G.R. No. 161407, June 05, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

*   **Parties:** Joaquin and Emma Villegas (Petitioners) vs. Rural Bank of Tanjay, Inc. (Respondent).
*   **Issue:** Can the petitioners recover possession of mortgaged properties given that the initial loan and mortgage contracts are null and void *ab initio* for violating the Rural Banks Act (R.A. No. 720) and were simulated, and can they benefit from a subsequent "Promise to Sell" agreement?

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Petitioners obtained a loan of P350,000 from the Respondent bank, secured by a real estate mortgage. The loan was structured to appear as multiple sugar crop loans under P50,000 each to comply with the Rural Banks Act, despite petitioners not engaging in sugarcane farming.
*   **Foreclosure and Redemption:** Petitioners failed to pay, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure. The bank purchased the property at the foreclosure sale, and the petitioners failed to redeem it within the one-year period.
*   **"Promise to Sell":**  After the redemption period lapsed, the parties entered a "Promise to Sell" agreement where the bank (as vendor) agreed to sell the foreclosed property back to the petitioners (as vendees) for P713,312.72, payable in installments. A P250,000 down payment was made.
*   **Default and Consolidation:** Petitioners failed to make the first yearly installment payment.  The bank consolidated ownership, cancelled the old title, and obtained a new title in its name.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:**  Petitioners filed suit seeking a declaration of nullity of the original loan and mortgage, recovery of possession, accounting, damages, or in the alternative, repurchase of the real estate.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC dismissed the complaint. The CA affirmed but modified, ordering the bank to reimburse the P250,000 down payment but removing the RTC's award of attorney's fees to the bank.

**Legal Analysis and Key Holdings:**

*   **Simulation:** The Supreme Court classified the sugar crop loans as **relatively simulated contracts** under Articles 1345 and 1346 of the Civil Code, where the parties intended to be bound but concealed the true nature of the agreement to circumvent the Rural Banks Act.
*   **Illegality/Public Policy:** The Court held that while the essential requisites of a contract were present, the *purpose* of the contracts was illicit and violated the requirements of the Rural Banks Act regarding agricultural loans to small farmers.
*   **Void Contract (Article 1409, Civil Code):** The loan and mortgage agreements were deemed void *ab initio* under Article 1409 of the Civil Code because their purpose was contrary to law and public policy. These contracts are not subject to ratification.
*   ***In Pari Delicto* (Article 1412, Civil Code):** Critically, the Court found that *both* parties were at fault. The petitioners knowingly participated in the scheme to circumvent the Rural Banks Act. Therefore, the principle of *in pari delicto* applies, barring either party from seeking relief from the court.  Specifically, neither party can recover what they have given under the void contract.
*   **Distinction from *Yuchengco v. Velayo***: The court distinguished this case from *Enrique T. Yuchengco, Inc., et al. v. Velayo* (200 Phil. 703 (1982)), where relief was granted despite equal guilt due to public policy considerations.  The Court found that granting relief to the petitioners would *not* serve the public policy behind the Rural Banks Act.
*   **"Promise to Sell" - Independent Contract:** The Court acknowledged that while the void loan and mortgage contracts barred recovery, the *Promise to Sell* was a separate and independent contract. While it involved the same parties and subject matter, it did not ratify the void agreements. Article 1370 of the Civil Code states that stipulations control if the contract's terms are clear. The Court relied on the express terms of the Promise to Sell, particularly the clause regarding reimbursement of the down payment.
*   **Reimbursement:** The Court upheld the CA's order for the bank to reimburse the petitioners' P250,000 down payment, as stipulated in the "Promise to Sell."

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Application of *In Pari Delicto***: The Court's strict application of *in pari delicto* could be seen as potentially unfair to borrowers in similar situations, particularly if they were less sophisticated than the bank and more vulnerable to the bank's influence. This could be a point of contention if litigating a similar case.
*   **Interpretation of "Promise to Sell":** The court's classification of the Promise to Sell as an independent contract, while technically correct, relies on a fairly formalistic interpretation. An argument could be made that it was inextricably linked to the original, void transaction.
*   **No Ratification of the Void Contract:** It is important to emphasize that even with a valid Promise to Sell, it does not ratify the void loan and mortgage contracts.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutes:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1318, 1345, 1346, 1370, 1409, 1412.
*   **Rural Banks Act (R.A. No. 720):** Sections 5 and 6.
*   ***Tala Realty Services Corp. v. Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank*** (441 Phil. 1 (2002)): Clean hands doctrine.
*   ***Enrique T. Yuchengco, Inc., et al. v. Velayo*** (200 Phil. 703 (1982)): Exception to *in pari delicto*.

**Conclusion:**

The petitioners' claim to recover the property failed due to their participation in the circumvention of the Rural Banks Act, triggering the *in pari delicto* doctrine.  While the "Promise to Sell" did not ratify the original void contracts, it did create an independent obligation on the bank to reimburse the down payment.  The case highlights the risks associated with entering into simulated contracts and the importance of complying with statutory requirements. It also illustrates the court's reluctance to grant relief to parties who do not come to court with clean hands.
