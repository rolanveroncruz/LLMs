## Legal Document Summary: *Edgar Mercado vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 161902

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's affirmance of the RTC's conviction of Edgar Mercado for Homicide (Art. 249, RPC) and Frustrated Homicide (Art. 249 in relation to Art. 6, RPC) stemming from a stabbing incident. Co-accused Romulo Cabiles' conviction is final. The Supreme Court denies the petition and affirms the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Homicide (Art. 249, RPC):** Mercado was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of killing Nelson Docto with an ice pick.
*   **Frustrated Homicide (Art. 249 in relation to Art. 6, RPC):** Mercado was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempting to kill John Gonzales with a broken bottle.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Mercado and Cabiles are jointly and severally liable for P50,000.00 for the death of Nelson Docto.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 7 months of *prision mayor* to 16 years of *reclusion temporal* for Homicide. Indeterminate penalty of 2 years and 6 months of *prison correctional* to 8 years and 6 months of *prision mayor* for Frustrated Homicide.
*   **Civil Liability:** Payment of P50,000.00 to the heirs of Nelson Docto (Homicide). Civil liability arising from the Frustrated Homicide is not specified in the dispositive portion but may be implied.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification:** Mercado argues unreliable identification by prosecution witnesses, citing inconsistencies and suggestive procedures. The court applied the totality of circumstances test from *People v. Teehankee, Jr.* (G.R. Nos. 111206-08, October 6, 1995, 249 SCRA 54, 96) to uphold the positive identification made by John Gonzales as reliable and admissible, noting Gonzales's opportunity to view the accused, his degree of attention, and the large number of photographs used in the identification process. The court discounted the inconsistencies in Gonzales's testimony referring to *Decasa v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 172184, July 10, 2007, 527 SCRA 267, which provided that inconsistencies do not necessarily discredit the witness since ex parte affidavits are almost always incomplete.
*   **Alibi:** Mercado presents an alibi defense, claiming he was in Iloilo at the time of the crime. The court rejects this defense due to its inherent weakness (referring to *People v. Tormis*, G.R. No. 183456, December 18, 2008, 574 SCRA 903, 916) and lack of corroborating evidence.
*   **Suggestive Identification:** Mercado could argue on appeal that despite the seemingly neutral photo array, subtle suggestive elements could have influenced the identification.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 6, 49 (Frustrated Homicide) and Article 249 (Homicide).
*   **People v. Teehankee, Jr.:** Defines the "totality of circumstances" test for evaluating the reliability of out-of-court identifications, including factors like witness opportunity to view the criminal, degree of attention, accuracy of prior description, level of certainty, time elapsed, and suggestiveness of the identification procedure.
*   **Decasa v. Court of Appeals:** Addresses the issue of inconsistencies between witness testimony and sworn statements.
*   **People v. Tormis:**  Reinforces that alibi is an inherently weak defense, especially in the face of positive identification.

**Ambiguities:**

*   While the identification process used with Realista had flaws, the Court considered the impact as minimal given the reliance on Gonzales' identification.

**Conclusion:** Mercado faces significant criminal and civil liability. The primary weakness lies in Mercado's ability to challenge the application of the "totality of circumstances" test regarding the identification process. The Court places great weight on the testimony of Gonzales and deems the alibi unsubstantiated. Future appeals would likely need to focus on challenging the reliability of the identification procedures and potentially introducing new evidence to support the alibi.
