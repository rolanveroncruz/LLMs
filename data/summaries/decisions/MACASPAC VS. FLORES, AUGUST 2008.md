**Case Summary: Macaspac v. Flores, A.M. No. P-05-2072 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 04-1989-P), August 13, 2008**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Ricardo C. Flores, a Process Server of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 3, Balanga City, Bataan, for Serious Neglect of Duty.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Filed by PO1 Rommel N. Macaspac alleging Flores's failure to properly serve a subpoena in Criminal Case Nos. 9038 and 9039, resulting in their dismissal. The cases involved violations of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).
*   **Alleged Neglect:** Flores reported non-service of the subpoena based on information from SPO3 Capuli that Macaspac had been reassigned, but Macaspac was still at his original station when service was attempted.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Flores claimed he acted in good faith, relying on information from SPO3 Capuli and attempted to personally serve the subpoena. He stated he had no reason to doubt the information and his actions were truthful and candid.
*   **OCA Findings:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Flores guilty of neglect of duty for failing to verify the information regarding Macaspac's reassignment and making a perfunctory attempt at service.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Process Server's Duty:** Process servers are obligated to exercise prudence, caution, and diligence in serving court processes (Rule 14, Rules of Court). Service must be made personally or through substituted service by leaving copies of the subpoena at the defendant's residence with someone of suitable age or leaving copies at the defendant's workplace.
*   **Liability for Neglect:** Failure to diligently serve court processes constitutes neglect of duty.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Third-Party Information:** The case highlights the risk of relying solely on third-party information without independent verification, even from fellow law enforcement officers.
*   **Definition of Diligence:** The level of diligence expected of a process server is potentially ambiguous. The court emphasized the need to "double check" information, implying a higher standard than simply accepting a single source.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The underlying criminal cases relate to this law.
*   **Rule 14 and Rule 21, Revised Rules of Court:** Govern service of summons and subpoenas, respectively. Section 6 of Rule 21 refers to the manner of serving subpoena and states that service must be made in the same manner as personal or substituted service of summons. Pertinent sections of Rule 14, Section 6 and 7 of Rule 14, in effect, provide for modes of service, personal and substituted.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Defines Simple Neglect of Duty as a less grave offense.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** The decision cites *Musni v. Morales* (373 Phil. 703 (1999) and several other cases emphasizing the duty of process servers.

**Outcome:**

*   Flores was found guilty of simple neglect of duty.
*   Penalty: Suspension for three (3) months without pay, with a stern warning.

**Legal Advice:**

This case serves as a cautionary tale for process servers and potentially other individuals involved in serving process. It highlights the importance of thorough verification of information, and the potential for administrative liability for failing to exercise due diligence. It also underscores the need for proper documentation of service attempts. Future actions should involve meticulous record-keeping and adherence to the specific requirements of Rule 14 and Rule 21.
