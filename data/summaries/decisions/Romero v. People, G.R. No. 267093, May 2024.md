## Legal Document Summary - *Romero v. People* (G.R. No. 267093)*

**Type:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines on Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Subject Matter:** Criminal Law - Kidnapping with Rape, Forcible Abduction, Rape.

**Date:** May 29, 2024

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Mark Anthony Romero y Flores
*   **Respondent:** People of the Philippines

**Background:** Romero was initially charged with the special complex crime of kidnapping with rape under Art. 267 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The RTC convicted him as charged. The Court of Appeals (CA) modified the decision, finding Romero guilty of Forcible Abduction under Art. 342 of the RPC. Romero appealed seeking acquittal.

**Issue:** Whether, based on the evidence, Romero can be found guilty of the crime charged. The Supreme Court reviews the CA's decision.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, modified the offense, and found Romero guilty beyond reasonable doubt of **Rape** under Art. 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Court sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Initial Charge (Kidnapping with Rape - Art. 267 RPC):** The SC correctly observed CA erred in only convicting of forcible abduction, as initial charge was kidnapping with rape.
    *   Art. 267 RPC defines kidnapping and serious illegal detention. The information included allegations of deprivation of liberty and rape, which are aggravating circumstances increasing the penalty.
    *   The SC correctly noted that intent to deprive the victim of liberty had to be proved.

*   **CA Ruling (Forcible Abduction - Art. 342 RPC):**
    *   The CA found the elements of forcible abduction present: (1) female victim; (2) abduction against her will; and (3) abduction with lewd designs.
    *   The CA erred in acquitting on rape charge.
    *   Art. 342 defines forcible abduction. The element of "lewd designs" is subjective but inferred from Romero's actions. *Amployo v. People* (496 Phil. 747 (2005))* is relevant regarding inferring lewd designs from overt acts.

*   **Supreme Court Ruling (Rape - Art. 266-A(1) RPC):**
    *   The SC finds circumstantial evidence sufficient to convict Romero of Rape
    *   Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction under Rule 133, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, if: (1) more than one circumstance; (2) facts inferred are proven; (3) combination creates conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
    *   The Court found the five enumerated circumstances established by AAA's testimony and Dr. Lizaso-Dy's medical findings sufficient to demonstrate Rape.
    *   The Court rejected the CA's reasonable doubt argument, invoking conspiracy. The companion's actions were found to show shared intent *People v. Peralta (134 Phil. 703 (1968))*

*   **Conspiracy:**
    *   The Court ruled that the companion's actions showed a clear conspiracy to commit the offense, thus both are equally liable. *People v. Evasco, 839 Phil. 612 (2018)*
    *   Implied conspiracy is proved from the acts before, during, and after commission of the crime, indubitably pointing to joint purpose.

*   **Absorption of Forcible Abduction into Rape:**
    *   The Court stated that the elements of forcible abduction were met but rape takes precedence.
    *   *Doctrine: Forcible abduction is absorbed into rape if the main objective is carnal knowledge of the victim, where forcible abduction serves as the means for the rape, and the victim isn't detained after that. This is as opposed to forcibly detaining the victim with lewd designs that resulted in actual rape where it is complexed.*

*   **Penalty:**
    *   The SC applied the penalty for Rape under Art. 266-B of the RPC: *reclusion perpetua*.
    *   Recidivism (prior conviction for Slight Illegal Detention) was not considered due to the indivisible nature of the penalty under Art. 63 RPC.
    *   Civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages were awarded to AAA, with interest as per *People v. Jugueta* (783 Phil. 806 (2016)) and *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* (716 Phil. 267 (2013)).

**Dissent:**
*   The dissenting Justice argues that the proper conviction should be the *complex crime of Forcible Abduction with Rape* under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Citing existing case law.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Reliance on circumstantial evidence for the rape conviction could be challenged based on the sufficiency of the evidence to exclude all other reasonable hypotheses. The "unbroken chain" of circumstances must be thoroughly defensible.
*   **Conspiracy:** The finding of conspiracy, while supported by the circumstantial evidence, could be challenged based on whether the level of shared intent and agreement was sufficiently proven.
*   **Absorption Doctrine:** Dissent is arguing the doctrine was misapplied.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Arts. 48, 63, 266-A, 266-B, 267, 342
*   Rules of Court: Rule 133, Section 4
