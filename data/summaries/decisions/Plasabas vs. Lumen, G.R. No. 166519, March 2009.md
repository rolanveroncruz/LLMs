**Legal Document Summary: Plasabas vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 166519 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a case for recovery of title to property with damages.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Matter:** A parcel of coconut land in Canturing, Maasin, Southern Leyte, originally declared under Tax Declaration No. 3587 in the name of Nieves Plasabas.
*   **Cause of Action:** Petitioners (Nieves Plasabas and Marcos Malazarte) filed suit to recover title and possession, alleging ownership. Respondents (Dominador Lumen and Aurora Aunzo) claimed the land was inherited from a common ancestor, Francisco Plasabas.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Dismissed the case *without prejudice* after both parties rested, citing failure to implead indispensable parties (Nieves' siblings Jose, Victor, and Victoria) as co-owners. The RTC relied on Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court regarding compulsory joinder of indispensable parties and cited *Borlasa v. Polistico, 47 Phil. 345 (1925)*; *Pobre v. Blanco, 17 Phil. 156 (1910)*; *People v. Rodriguez, G.R. Nos. L-14059-62, (1959)*; *Palarca v. Baginsi, 38 Phil. 177 (1918)*; *Sanidad v. Cabataje, 5 Phil. 204 (1905)*.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's dismissal, holding that non-joinder violated due process and that Article 487 of the Civil Code (re: ejectment actions by co-owners) was inapplicable because the action was for recovery of title (reivindicatory action), not ejectment.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the petition, reversed the CA, and remanded the case to the RTC for disposition on the merits.
*   **Basis of SC Ruling:**
    *   Applied Article 487 of the Civil Code, stating it applies to all actions for recovery of possession, including *accion publiciana* and *reivindicatory* actions.
    *   A co-owner can file suit without joining other co-owners as co-plaintiffs as the suit is deemed instituted for the benefit of all. Cites *Baloloy v. Hular, G.R. No. 157767, (2004)*. A judgment favorable to the plaintiff benefits all co-owners, while an adverse judgment does not prejudice the unimpleaded co-owners.
    *   The exception is when the action is solely for the plaintiff's benefit claiming sole ownership, requiring joinder of other co-owners. Cites *Adlawan v. Adlawan, G.R. No. 161916, (2006)*.  However, this exception was not applicable as Petitioners acknowledged co-ownership during trial and authorization to represent the other co-owners.
    *   Non-joinder of indispensable parties is *not* a ground for dismissal, but rather the remedy is to implead them. Cites *PepsiCo, Inc. v. Emerald Pizza, Inc., G.R. No. 153059, (2007)*.
*   **Obligations:** The trial court is obligated to proceed with the case on the merits and decide it with dispatch.

**Liabilities:**

*   The liability relates to the underlying claim of ownership and possession of the subject property, to be determined by the RTC on remand.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Delay:** The case commenced in 1974, indicating significant delays. Remand could further prolong resolution.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The central dispute revolves around ownership and inheritance, which require factual determinations based on evidence presented. These determinations could be complex and contested.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Article 487 of the Civil Code
*   Rule 3, Section 7 of the Rules of Court
*   *Baloloy v. Hular, G.R. No. 157767 (2004)*

*   *Sanidad v. Cabataje, 5 Phil. 204 (1905)*

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court has clarified that the RTC and CA erred in dismissing the case for failure to implead indispensable parties. The suit can proceed even without all co-owners as plaintiffs. The case is now remanded for a decision on the merits, focusing on evidence relating to ownership and inheritance rights.
