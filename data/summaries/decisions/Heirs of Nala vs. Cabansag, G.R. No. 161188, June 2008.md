**Case:** *Heirs of Purisima Nala v. Artemio Cabansag*, G.R. No. 161188, June 13, 2008 (577 Phil. 310)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, dismissing a claim for damages filed by Artemio Cabansag against Purisima Nala and her lawyer, Atty. Del Prado, arising from demand letters sent to Cabansag requesting rental payments or vacating property he purchased from spouses Gomez. Nala believed the property was owned by her late husband and the Gomezes held it in trust.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Basis of Claim:** Cabansag's claim for damages was based on Article 19 of the Civil Code (abuse of rights).
*   **Article 19 Requirements:** The court outlines the requirements for liability under Article 19: (a) existence of a legal right or duty; (b) exercise of that right in bad faith; and (c) sole intent to prejudice or injure another.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original RTC & CA Decisions:** Initially, the RTC and CA found Nala and Atty. Del Prado jointly and severally liable for moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed this, finding no liability because the elements of Article 19 were not met. Nala acted to protect what she believed were her property rights.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Abuse of Rights" Application:** The core issue revolved around whether Nala's actions constituted an abuse of rights. The lower courts initially found that it did, but the Supreme Court disagreed, emphasizing the absence of bad faith or malicious intent on Nala's part.
*   **Fictitious Sale & Trust:** The dispute stemmed from a prior alleged fictitious sale to the Gomezes. Nala believed the property was held in trust. The conflicting claims about ownership were a key factor.
*   **Conflicting Court Decisions (Reconveyance):** The CA initially took note of an RTC decision dismissing Nala's reconveyance case. However, that decision was later reversed by the CA (CA-G.R. CV No. 49163) and affirmed by the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 144148), ordering the reconveyance to Nala. This reversal significantly impacted the Supreme Court's reasoning, supporting Nala's legitimate claim to protect her property interests.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 19:** The foundation of the claim for damages.
*   **Good Faith Presumption:** Cited *Saber v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 132981, August 31, 2004, 437 SCRA 259, 278, emphasizing the presumption of good faith and the burden to prove bad faith.
*   **Elements of Abuse of Rights:** *Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Pacilan, Jr.*, G.R. No. 157314, July 29, 2005, 465 SCRA 372, 382, outlined the requirements for abuse of rights liability.
*   **Distinction Between Injury and Damage:** *Lagon v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 119107, March 18, 2005, 453 SCRA 616, 627-628, clarified that damage without injury (*damnum absque injuria*) does not provide a cause of action.
*   **Rightful Exercise of Property Rights:** The court cites *Pro Line Sports Center, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 346 Phil. 143, 154 (1997) emphasizing that there is no injury when one makes use of his own legal right.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinged on the absence of evidence of bad faith or malicious intent on Nala's part when sending the demand letters. The subsequent reconveyance decision solidified her claim that she had legitimate interests to protect, justifying her actions. The case serves as a reminder of the high bar for proving abuse of rights and the importance of demonstrating bad faith.
