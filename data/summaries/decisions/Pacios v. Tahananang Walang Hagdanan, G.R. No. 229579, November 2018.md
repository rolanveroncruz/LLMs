**Case Summary: *Bernardo B. Pacios, et al. vs. Tahanang Walang Hagdanan and Sister Valeriana Baerts, ICM***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 229579, November 14, 2018 (843 Phil. 312)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision and Resolution denying release of supersedeas bond.  The SC ultimately granted the petition.

**Facts:**

*   Workers (petitioners), PWD employees of Tahanang Walang Hagdanan (respondent), were illegally dismissed.
*   Labor Arbiter (LA) ruled in favor of workers, awarding a monetary judgment.
*   Respondent appealed to NLRC but appeal was initially dismissed for insufficient cash bond (P40,000). They later filed a surety bond.
*   CA reinstated the appeal, finding the combined cash and surety bonds sufficient. This was affirmed by the SC.
*   Workers sought release of the supersedeas bond (10% of the judgment amount) pending appeal, but LA suspended the release due to the reinstated appeal.
*   CA denied the workers' Petition for Mandamus, citing Section 17, Rule XI of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, which suspends execution upon reversal of judgment by the CA.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure, Rule XI, Section 17:** Suspension of Execution Proceedings upon Reversal of Judgment.  The SC found the CA incorrectly applied this rule, noting the suspension applies only "insofar as the reversal is concerned."
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure, Rule XI, Section 3:** Effect of Perfection of Appeal on Execution - Ordinarily an appeal stays the execution of a Labor Arbiterâ€™s decision except for reinstatement. The CA should have applied this rule to the facts of the case.
*   **Propriety of CA's Reinstatement of Appeal (CA-G.R. SP No. 136907):**  The SC found the CA erred in reinstating the respondent's appeal when it did not adequately explain how its refusal to consider allegedly meritorious grounds constituted an exceptional circumstance under Mcburnie that would allow the appeal to proceed despite non-perfection. The SC observed that the respondent's appeal was not perfected with a sufficient amount as appeal bond.
*   **Execution Pending Appeal:**  The Supreme Court ultimately found that execution proceedings should continue, based on the principles articulated in *Aris (Phil.), Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission*. It reasoned that the dire circumstances of the petitioners, coupled with the NLRC's multiple rulings in their favor, justified immediate release of the bond.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent:** Obligation to pay the monetary award determined by the LA (subject to pending motion for reconsideration before NLRC on the affirmed LA decision, that has the effect of staying execution).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent:** Financial liability for back wages, damages, and attorney's fees arising from the illegal dismissal (though individual respondents were relieved of liability by NLRC).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Pending Motion for Reconsideration:** The NLRC's decision affirming the LA decision is currently subject to a motion for reconsideration by the respondent, creating uncertainty. The SC noted that the motion for reconsideration is the only procedural impediment to the execution of the LA Decision.
*   **Conflict between NLRC Rules:** The petition raised a potential conflict between Sections 4 and 17 of Rule XI of the NLRC Rules; the CA's reasoning was based on Section 17, while petitioners argued for the application of Section 4 (effect of certiorari on execution).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Article 223):** Requires posting of a bond for appeals involving monetary awards.
*   **Mcburnie v. Ganzon, 719 Phil. 680 (2013):**  Relaxed the bond requirement upon showing of meritorious grounds and posting of a reasonable bond amount.  Cited by the CA (erroneously, according to SC).
*   **Aris (Phil.), Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 277 Phil. 282 (1991):**  Authorizes execution of decisions reinstating dismissed employees in labor cases pending appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted the Petition, and the National Labor Relations Commission's cashier was directed to release to petitioners the amount deposited by respondents as supersedeas bond. The Labor Arbiter was directed to immediately continue the execution proceedings.
