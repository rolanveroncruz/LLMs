**Case Summary: *Dominga Ruiz, et al. v. Cirila delos Santos***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 166386, January 27, 2009 (597 Phil. 27)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari and Mandamus seeking reversal of Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions dismissing a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Ruiz siblings) owned seven parcels of land.
*   Respondent (delos Santos) was a licensed real estate broker.
*   Olimpio Ruiz verbally authorized respondent to sell the property in 1995, later formalized in writing. The written authority specified commission payment even after expiration if a buyer negotiated during its validity was registered.
*   Respondent introduced Olimpio to Tantiansu (buyer), registering Tantiansu as a prospective buyer.
*   Land was eventually sold to corporations owned by Tantiansu for a lower price than originally discussed, without respondent's involvement in the final negotiation. Deeds of Sale reflected a price of P60/sqm.
*   Respondent demanded broker's commission, which was refused.
*   Respondent sued for collection of sum of money and damages.

**Procedural History:**

*   RTC rendered judgment in favor of Respondent, ordering Petitioners to pay commission, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   Petitioners' appeal was denied by the RTC for failure to pay appellate docket fees on time, pursuant to Section 13, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. RTC ruled that the Decision had become final and executory.
*   Petitioners filed a Petition for Relief from Denial of Appeal, alleging mistake and excusable negligence of counsel. This was also denied.
*   Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus with the CA, seeking to set aside the RTC orders.
*   CA dismissed the petition on procedural grounds (failure to file motion for reconsideration, incomplete names of heirs, lack of SPA), pursuant to Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.
*   Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA's dismissal, but ultimately affirmed the RTC's denial of the Petition for Relief.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Broker's Commission:** Written authority to sell stipulated commission even after the authority expired, provided the prospective buyer was registered in writing. *Civil Code provisions on Agency.*
*   **Perfection of Appeal:** Payment of appellate docket fees within the prescribed period is mandatory. *Rule 41, Section 4, Rules of Court.*
*   **Petition for Relief:** Grounds for relief include fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence preventing the taking of an appeal. *Rule 38, Section 2, Rules of Court.*

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for broker's commission to Respondent, despite selling the property for a lower price through direct negotiations. *Contractual obligations arising from the authority to sell.*
*   Petitioners are bound by the negligence of their counsel in failing to perfect the appeal, although some exceptions exist.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Negligence of Counsel:** The general rule is that clients are bound by their counsel's mistakes, negligence, and omission. *Jurisprudence on the attorney-client relationship.*
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Failure to strictly comply with procedural rules (e.g., payment of docket fees) can be fatal to the appeal.
*   **Damages:** Exposure to moral and exemplary damages if bad faith or malice is proven in refusing to pay the commission.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Villena v. Rupisan*: Motion for Reconsideration as prerequisite to Certiorari
*   *Sevillana v. I.T. (International) Corporation*: Exceptions to motion for reconsideration requirement
*   *M.A. Santander Construction Inc. v. Villanueva*: Perfection of appeal requires timely docket fee payment
*   *De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan*: Exception where counsel's mistake affects client's liberty. (Distinguished)
*   *Samala v. Court of Appeals*: Excusable negligence for late filing of appeal. (Distinguished)
*   *Jaro v. Court of Appeals*: Substantial compliance with procedural rules (Distinguished)
*   *Fukuzumi v. Sanritsu Great International Corporation*: Client bound by counsel's mistakes
*   *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ascot Holdings and Equities Inc.*: Relaxation of procedural rules in order to serve and achieve substantial justice

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The written authority to sell and its interpretation regarding the commission entitlement after its expiration, particularly concerning the changed sales price and direct negotiations.
*   The degree to which Olimpio's (as opposed to the other Ruiz siblings) actions bound all the Petitioners in terms of the agency agreement.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Agency provisions governing the relationship between the Petitioners (as principals) and the Respondent (as agent).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 38, Section 2 (Petition for Relief), Rule 41, Sections 3 and 4 (Perfection of Appeal), Rule 46, Section 3 (Requirements for petitions in the CA)

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   The SC emphasized the importance of strictly adhering to the Rules of Court, particularly concerning the perfection of appeals. Relief from a final judgment based on counsel's negligence is difficult to obtain.
*   This case underscores the need for thorough client communication and diligence on the part of counsel to ensure timely compliance with procedural requirements.
