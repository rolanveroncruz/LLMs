## Legal Document Summary: *Romulo Tindoy v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 157106, September 03, 2008)

**Case Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Petitioner Romulo Tindoy (police officer) for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. The conviction stems from the death of Dominador Viernes, who allegedly sustained fatal head injuries after being taken into police custody following a domestic violence report.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Homicide (Art. 249, RPC) - Allegedly committed in conspiracy with co-accused PO1 Manuel Fernandez and PO3 Ariel Sanchez.
*   **Facts:**
    *   Police officers responded to a domestic violence call involving the victim and his common-law wife, Elsie Fernandez.
    *   Victim resisted arrest, claiming to be a military man.
    *   Victim was taken to the police station.
    *   Prosecution Witness Elsie, alleges that police officers, including the petitioner, mauled the victim at the police station, causing head injuries.
    *   Defense claims the victim sustained injuries when Elsie hit him with a piece of wood during their argument.
    *   Victim died two days later due to traumatic head injuries.
    *   Medical evidence indicated multiple blows to the head.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   RTC: Found Petitioner and co-accused guilty of Homicide. Sentenced to indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of Eight (8) Years and one (1) Day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to Fourteen (14) Years, Eight (8) Months and One (1) Day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum and ordered to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P 71, 900.00, by way of actual damages.
    *   CA: Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The CA erred in relying on the faulty testimony of Elsie, who he argues is the more likely suspect.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Found criminally liable for Homicide and sentenced to imprisonment. Obligated to pay indemnity to the victim's family (P71,900.00).
*   **Co-accused:** Also found criminally liable, but lost the right to appeal after going into hiding.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting testimonies:** Prosecution and defense present vastly different accounts of how the victim sustained his injuries. The core of the case hinges on the credibility of Elsie's testimony.
*   **Chain of Custody:** No issues with the chain of custody were raised.
*   **No witnesses:** Outside of Elsie, there were no witness who saw the police assault the victim.
*   **Factual Dispute:** The Supreme Court notes that the petition primarily raises factual questions which are generally not reviewable.
*   **Doctor's Testimony:** The doctor who initially examined the victim testified that the victim said his wife caused the wound.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes the crime of Homicide.
*   **Section 1, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Governs appeals to the Supreme Court which should only raise questions of law.
*   **People v. Laceste, G.R. No. 127127, July 30, 1998, 293 SCRA 397:**  Reiterates the principle that the trial court's factual findings, especially its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, are generally accorded great weight and respect on appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Elsie's Testimony:**  The central point of contention.  The defense argued Elsie was the actual perpetrator, pointing to the victimâ€™s statement to the initial attending physician.
*   **Cause of Death:** While the autopsy cites "traumatic injury, head," the exact mechanism (single blow vs. multiple blows) is debated, impacting the determination of who caused the fatal injuries.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision, finding no compelling reason to disturb the factual findings of the trial court, particularly the assessment of Elsie's credibility which was corroborated by the medical evidence.
