## Legal Document Summary: People v. Feriol, G.R. No. 232154 (August 20, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the CA decision and **acquitted** the accused, Benjamin Feriol, due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and to adequately justify deviations from the procedural requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Criminalizes the illegal sale, delivery, and distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):** Prescribes the procedure for handling seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items *at the place of seizure or nearest police station*
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, and representatives from the National Prosecution Service *or* the media during inventory and photography
    *   Chain of custody to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving each element of the crime (identity of buyer, seller, object, consideration; delivery and payment) *beyond a reasonable doubt*. It also carries a **positive duty** to prove compliance with Section 21.
*   **Saving Clause:** Non-compliance with Section 21 is *not fatal* if:
    *   There are justifiable grounds for non-compliance
    *   The integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.  The prosecution *must prove* the justifiable grounds as facts; the court will not presume them.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Erroneous Conviction:** Failure to strictly adhere to Section 21 can result in the reversal of a conviction, even if the accused fails to raise the issue during trial (per *People v. Miranda* and similar cases). This emphasizes the prosecutor's proactive duty.
*   **Suppression of Evidence:** Evidence obtained in violation of Section 21 may be deemed inadmissible.
*   **Liability of Apprehending Officers:** Potential administrative or criminal liability for deliberate or negligent non-compliance with Section 21.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable grounds" for non-compliance:**  The interpretation of what constitutes justifiable grounds is fact-specific and can be contentious.  The prosecution must clearly articulate and prove these grounds.
*   **"Properly preserved":**  The standard for demonstrating that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved, despite procedural lapses, is not explicitly defined and requires careful scrutiny of the specific facts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  The primary statute governing illegal drugs.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):**  Modified Section 21 to its current form.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):**  Emphasized the importance of the presence of media or DOJ representatives.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010) and People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 617 (2010):** Discussed the application of the saving clause and the need to prove justifiable grounds.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671 (January 31, 2018) and People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 231383 (March 7, 2018):**  Reiterate the *positive duty* of prosecutors to demonstrate Section 21 compliance, even if the issue is not raised at trial.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Strict compliance with Section 21, RA 9165 is *paramount* in drug cases.
*   The prosecution *must* proactively address and justify any deviations from the prescribed procedures.
*   Failure to secure the presence of mandated witnesses during inventory and photography, *without justifiable reason*, can be fatal to the prosecution's case, even on appeal.
