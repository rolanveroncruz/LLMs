Okay, here is a legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Artemio J. Romares v. National Labor Relations Commission and Pilmico Foods Corporation* (G.R. No. 122327, August 19, 1998)

**Nature:** Illegal Dismissal

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Romares was hired by Pilmico Foods Corporation (Pilmico) multiple times over several years (1989-1993) as a mason in the Maintenance/Projects/Engineering Department.  The engagements were intermittent, ranging from 2-5 months each.
*   Romares performed maintenance work: painting, cleaning, equipment operation, and assisting regular employees.
*   Pilmico terminated Romares, claiming his contract expired. Romares claimed illegal dismissal, asserting regular employee status.

**Lower Court Decisions:**

*   **Executive Labor Arbiter:** Ruled in favor of Romares, finding him a regular employee due to the repeated rehiring for necessary work exceeding one year of service, thus covered by security of tenure. Cited *Kimberly Independent Labor Union v. Drilon* and *National Service Corporation v. NLRC*. Ordered reinstatement, backwages, and attorney's fees.
*   **National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC):** Reversed the Executive Labor Arbiter. The NLRC held that Romares was a contractual employee with fixed-term contracts, thus his termination was valid upon contract expiration. Focused on Article 280, paragraph 1 of the Labor Code.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed the NLRC and reinstated the Executive Labor Arbiter's decision.**
*   Found Romares to be a regular employee.
*   Emphasized that Romares' work as a mason was "usually necessary or desirable" to Pilmico's business, thus making him a regular employee under Article 280 of the Labor Code.
*   Cited *Baguio Country Club Corporation vs. NLRC,* holding that continuous or intermittent performance of a job for at least one year deems the activity necessary to the business.
*   Rejected Pilmico's argument that the employment was for a specific project or undertaking. The court considered the short-term contracts a "subterfuge" to circumvent security of tenure.
*   Cited *Cielo vs. NLRC* and *Samson vs. NLRC,* emphasizing the need to protect employees from contractual schemes designed to prevent regularization.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Article 280 of the Labor Code:** Defined regular and casual employment. The Supreme Court emphasized the "usually necessary or desirable" language.
*   **Security of Tenure:** The central issue. The Court protected the employee's right against circumvention through fixed-term contracts.
*   **Fixed-Term Contracts:** The Court acknowledged the *Brent School, Inc. vs. Zamora* doctrine, allowing fixed-term employment under specific conditions: (1) Knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon, without duress; (2) Employer and employee on equal footing. Found that these conditions were not met.
*   **Bad Faith:** The Court found Pilmico acted in bad faith by repeatedly rehiring and terminating Romares to avoid regularization.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The application of *Brent School* is fact-specific. Employers may still try to use fixed-term contracts, so the voluntariness and equality of bargaining power must be carefully scrutinized.
*   The "necessary or desirable" test under Article 280 can be subject to interpretation, potentially leading to future litigation regarding the nature of work.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Article 280 (Regular and Casual Employment)

**Case Law:**

*   *Kimberly Independent Labor Union for Solidarity, Activism and Nationalism - Olalia v. Hon. Franklin M. Drilon*, G.R. No. 77629 and 78791
*   *National Service Corporation v. NLRC, 168 SCRA 122*
*   *Baguio Country Club Corporation vs. NLRC, 206 SCRA 643*
*   *Cielo vs. NLRC, 193 SCRA 410*
*   *Samson vs. NLRC, 253 SCRA 112*
*   *Brent School, Inc. vs . Zamora, 181 SCRA 702*

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the principle that employers cannot use fixed-term contracts to circumvent employees' right to security of tenure, especially when the work performed is necessary or desirable to the employer's business.  The burden is on the employer to demonstrate that the fixed-term agreement was entered into voluntarily and on equal footing with the employee.
