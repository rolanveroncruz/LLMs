## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Narvasa, et al.*, G.R. No. 128618 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This Supreme Court decision reviews the convictions of Felicisimo Narvasa and Jimmy Orania for aggravated illegal possession of firearms, stemming from the death of SPO3 Primo Camba. The RTC found the accused guilty based on eyewitness testimony, paraffin test results, and recovery of ammunition matching the alleged firearms.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Initial Charges:** Accused were initially charged with Homicide (Crim. Case No. 2629-A), and aggravated illegal possession of firearms (PD 1866) for Felicisimo Narvasa (M-14 Rifle, Crim. Case No. 2648-A) and Jimmy Orania (.30 U.S. Carbine, Crim. Case No. 2646-A), which were allegedly used to kill SPO3 Camba.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC found them guilty of aggravated illegal possession of firearms, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*, and considering homicide an element of the illegal possession charge.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court modified the decision, finding the accused GUILTY of HOMICIDE with the special aggravating circumstance of using unlicensed firearms.
*   **Retroactive Application of R.A. 8294:** The SC applied RA 8294 retroactively, which changed the offense to homicide with the use of an unlicensed firearm as an aggravating circumstance, rather than a separate crime of aggravated illegal possession.
*   **Penalties:** Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused were sentenced to 12 years *prision mayor* (minimum) to 20 years *reclusion temporal* (maximum), and ordered to pay P50,000 in death indemnity to Camba's heirs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for homicide.
*   Civil liability to the heirs of SPO3 Camba for death indemnity.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Reliance on eyewitness accounts, which are subject to scrutiny regarding inconsistencies and potential biases. The defense challenged the credibility of witnesses due to alleged inconsistencies in their testimonies.
*   **Lack of Firearm Presentation:** The firearms themselves were not presented as evidence, raising questions about establishing the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Parol Evidence for Illegal Possession:** The case hinges on establishing illegal possession of firearms through parol evidence, which may be challenged as insufficient.
*   **Conspiracy:** The finding of conspiracy makes each accused liable for the actions of the others, even if it is not definitively proven who fired the fatal shot.
*   **Moral Damages:** The trial court's award of moral damages was deleted by the Supreme Court due to lack of evidence of emotional distress.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of "High Powered Firearm":**  The definition of "high powered firearm" under RA 8294 may be subject to interpretation and further challenge.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court correctly applied RA 8294 retroactively, resulting in a reduced charge and sentence for the accused. However, the reliance on circumstantial evidence and the lack of physical evidence (the firearms) could be points of continued contention for the defense, although likely unsuccessful given the totality of the evidence and existing legal precedent.
