**Case:** SM Investments Corporation v. Mac Graphics Carranz International Corp., G.R. Nos. 224131-32 & Prime Metroestate, Inc. v. Mac Graphics Carranz International Corp., G.R. Nos. 224337-38, June 25, 2018.

**Subject:** Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) grant of a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction (WPMI) in favor of Mac Graphics.

**Facts:**

*   Mac Graphics (Respondent) entered into a 20-year lease agreement with Pilipinas Makro, Inc. (Makro/now PMI) for billboard sites at Makro Cubao and Makati (effective Jan 15, 2007, expiring Jan 14, 2027).
*   The Lease Contract contained stipulations regarding term, necessary permits and licenses, warranties of the Lessee, rescission and pre-termination clause.
*   SM Investments Corporation (SMIC/Petitioner) has substantial interest in Makro (10% stock ownership, Rappel Holdings, Inc. (owned by SMIC) owns 50%).
*   Makro terminated the lease in 2008, citing Mac Graphics' failure to obtain necessary permits and insurance.
*   Mac Graphics filed a complaint for injunction and damages, arguing improper termination without a chance to remedy the alleged breaches.
*   RTC granted a WPMI, ordering Makro and SMIC to restore Mac Graphics' possession.
*   CA affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Term:** 20-year lease, renewable upon mutually acceptable terms.
*   **Lessee's Obligations (Mac Graphics):** Obtain necessary permits and licenses (Barangay, Business, Building/Sign). Obtain sufficient "All-Risk" property insurance with third party liability.
*   **Lessor's Obligations (Makro/PMI):** Assist the Lessee in securing certain licenses and permits (Barangay, Business, Building/Sign).
*   **Pre-termination:** By either party, if the other fails to comply with obligations, and the breach is either not remediable or unremedied for 90 days after written notice.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Makro/PMI:** Potential liability for breach of contract if the termination is deemed wrongful. Risk of specific performance and damages.
*   **SMIC:** Potential liability if deemed to have acted in concert with Makro/PMI, despite not being a party to the contract. Risk of being held jointly liable for damages.
*   **Mac Graphics:** Risk of failing to prove the validity of the Lease Contract and suffering damages as a result of termination. Risk that damages will be deemed speculative.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Assistance" in securing permits:** The extent of Makro/PMI's obligation to "assist" in obtaining permits is not clearly defined and is a point of contention.
*   **Remediability of Breaches:** Whether the failure to obtain permits and insurance before the commencement date of the lease is a remediable breach within the 90-day cure period is heavily disputed.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 58:** Preliminary Injunction.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1191:** Rescission of Reciprocal Obligations.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1266:** Obligations to do becoming impossible
*   **Civil Code, Article 1267:** Obligations becoming manifestly difficult.
*   **Heirs of Melencio Yu v. Court of Appeals, 717 Phil. 284 (2013):** Requisites for WPMI, clear legal right, material/substantial violation, urgent/permanent necessity.
*   **Power Sites and Signs, Inc. v. United Neon, 620 Phil. 205 (2009):** Requirements for injunctive relief. Entitlement to relief, violation of rights, irreparable injury, inadequate pecuniary compensation.
*   **AMA Land, Inc. v. Wack Wack Residents' Association, Inc., G.R. No. 202342, July 19, 2017:** Further clarification of injunctive writ requirements.
*   **Republic v. Principalia Management and Personnel Consultants, Inc., 521 Phil. 718 (2006)**
*   **Semirara Coal Corporation v. HGL Development Corporation, 539 Phil. 532 (2006)**
*   **Searth Commodities Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 64220, March 31, 1992, 207 SCRA 622:** Courts should avoid issuing injunctions that dispose of main case.

**Potential Risks and Strategy Points:**

*   The Supreme Court found that Mac Graphics failed to establish prima facie a clear and unmistakable right due to conflicting interpretations of contract terms and the validity of the lease's pre-termination.
*   SMIC argued it wasn't a party to the lease and its ownership in Makro shouldn't justify joint injunctive relief. The Supreme Court did not resolve these issues and directed the RTC to hear and decide the case on the merits.
*   Key defenses should focus on proving Mac Graphics' material breach of contract (failure to obtain permits/insurance) and justifying the termination. The Supreme Court emphasized that any damage suffered by Mac Graphics may be easily quantifiable and reparable.
*   PMI can argue impossibility/undue hardship to perform the WPMI due to the sale of the property to a third party, Super Shopping Market, Inc.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petitions of SMIC and PMI, reversed the CA decision, and directed the RTC to hear and decide the case on the merits. The Court held that the CA committed grave error for upholding the grant of the WPMI by the RTC in favor of Mac Graphics given the patent absence of a clear and unmistakable right of Mac Graphics and its injury, if any, that is easily quantifiable and reparable.
