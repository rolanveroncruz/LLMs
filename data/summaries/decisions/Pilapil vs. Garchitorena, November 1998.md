Here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Eduardo P. Pilapil v. Hon. Francis E. Garchitorena, et al.* G.R. No. 128790, November 25, 1998 (359 Phil. 674)

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging Sandiganbayan's denial of several motions in Criminal Case No. 16672, for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019.

**Background:** The case stems from a PCSO ambulance donation to Tigaon, Camarines Sur, initially received by Pilapil (then Congressman) but not delivered. Presiding Justice Garchitorena (from Tigaon) brought this to the attention of authorities. The Ombudsman initially found probable cause, filed an Information, then later moved to withdraw it due to lack of evidence.

**Key Issues & Holding:**

1.  **Impartiality:** The Court held that Garchitorena's participation as Presiding Justice, despite being the initial complainant, did not violate due process. The act of reporting a possible transgression is a duty, and prior SC decision (G.R. No. 101978) upheld this.

2.  **Re-Raffling of Case (RA 7975):** The Court upheld the re-assignment of the case to the 2nd Division after Justice del Rosario's inhibition. The court found Administrative Order No. 79-96 valid, as it was based on internal rules, specifically Sec. 2, Rule III of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan. RA 7975 addresses quorum issues due to *legal disqualification*, which is under Rule 137 (related party), while Justice del Rosario's inhibition was discretionary.

3.  **Withdrawal of Information:** The Sandiganbayan's denial of the Ombudsman's motion to withdraw the Information was upheld. *Crespo v. Mogul* and *Martinez v. CA* establish the court's duty to independently assess the evidence, not act as a mere rubber stamp. The Sandiganbayan considered prior SC ruling and found justification to deny withdrawal.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** The alleged violation.
*   **R.A. No. 7975:** Amendment to P.D. No. 1606 concerning the Sandiganbayan's structure and procedures.
*   **P.D. No. 1606:** Original decree creating the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Rule 137, Rules of Court:** Disqualification of Judges
*   **Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan:** Rule III, Section 2 on absence/vacancy and re-raffling.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay:** The Court explicitly notes and condemns Pilapil's dilatory tactics. Further delays could risk sanctions.
*   **"Clean Hands" Doctrine:** The Court invokes the "clean hands" doctrine due to Pilapil's conduct. This could negatively impact future equitable remedies sought by Pilapil in this case.
*   **Balancing Impartiality and Citizen Duty:** The Court's stance that Garchitorena's initial complaint doesn't compromise impartiality needs careful consideration.  While citizen's duty is paramount, perception of bias (even if unfounded) is a potential issue.

**Outcome:** Petition DISMISSED. Sandiganbayan ordered to proceed with arraignment and trial promptly.
