**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Larry and Flora Davis v. Spouses Florencio and Lucrecia Davis* (G.R. No. 233489, March 7, 2018)**

**Core Issue:** Whether the RTC properly denied the Petitioners' motion for execution of a 1998 Decision ordering Respondents to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale, considering the lapse of over five years from the decision's finality, and whether a separate action for annulment of title tolled the execution period.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract to Sell:**  Petitioners (buyers) and Respondents (sellers) entered into a Contract to Sell in 1991 for a 500 sq. m. lot.  Full payment was made.
*   **Initial RTC Decision (1998):** RTC ordered Respondents to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale and pay damages (moral, exemplary, attorney's fees). Affirmed by CA in 2004.
*   **Sale to Third Parties:** Respondents sold the property to third parties (Erana et al.) after the RTC decision but prior to its execution, resulting in a new TCT. The initial TCT had a *lis pendens*.
*   **Annulment Action (Civil Case No. 768-M-08):** Petitioners filed an action to annul the new title. RTC ruled in favor of Petitioners, declaring the third party's TCT null and void, and restored the original TCT in Respondents' names. This became final in 2012.
*   **Motion for Execution (2016):**  Petitioners filed an "Urgent Ex-Parte Manifestation and Motion" to implement the 1998 decision.  Respondents argued the 5-year period for execution had lapsed (Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Court).
*   **RTC Denial:** The RTC denied the motion, stating the annulment action did not toll the execution period.
*   **CA Dismissal:** CA dismissed Petitioners' Petition for Certiorari, citing failure to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC order and submission of mere photocopies of documents.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents were obligated to execute the Deed of Absolute Sale per the 1998 RTC decision.
*   Respondents had an obligation to refrain from any action that would frustrate the implementation of the 1998 decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are liable for Specific Performance (execution of Deed of Absolute Sale).
*   Respondents are liable for the damages awarded in the 1998 RTC decision (moral, exemplary, attorney's fees).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Statute of Limitations:** The central risk is the expiration of the statute of limitations on enforcing the judgment. *Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Court* allows execution within five years of finality or enforcement by action before barred by statute of limitations.
*   **Tolling of the Execution Period:** The critical legal question is whether the filing and resolution of the annulment action tolled or suspended the running of the 5-year period for execution by motion. The court relies on the exception where delay is caused by the judgment debtor.
*   **Third Party Rights:** While the third-party title was annulled, any claims they may have against the Respondents (sellers) are not addressed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Court:**  Governs execution of judgments.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 91885, August 7, 1996, 260 SCRA 344:**  Cited for the principle that delay caused by the judgment debtor allows execution by motion after five years.
*   **Jacinto v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., No. L-66478, August 29, 1988:** Cited regarding computation of time limited for suing out an execution, the time during which execution is stayed should be excluded.
*  **Saint Louis University, Inc., et al. v. Olairez, et al., G.R. Nos. 162299 & 174758, March 26, 2014:**  Cited regarding the exception in the Motion for Reconsideration requirement, where the questions raised have already been passed upon by the lower court.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the Petition, reversed the CA's dismissal, and ordered the RTC to immediately issue a writ of execution. The Court held that the filing of the annulment action tolled the execution period because the delay was caused by Respondents' act of selling the property to avoid the judgment. The Respondents were attempting to benefit from their own wrongdoing, and therefore, the period of the annulment case must be excluded.

**Implications:**

This decision reinforces the principle that judgment debtors cannot benefit from their own actions that delay or prevent the execution of a judgment. The filing of an action for annulment of title, necessitated by the judgment debtor's actions, can toll the prescriptive period for execution.
