## Summary of DAR v. Sarangani Agriculture Co., Inc., et al. (G.R. No. 165547)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Partial Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court decision regarding the DAR's denial of respondents' application for land conversion and the acquisition of land for agrarian reform.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Affirmation of DAR's Denial of Conversion:** The Court affirmed the DAR's denial of the application for conversion of 154.622 hectares of land, whose deferment period had expired.
*   **Remand for Acquisition Proceedings:** The case was remanded to the DAR to properly effect the acquisition of the subject lands for distribution to intended beneficiaries.
*   **Mandatory Notices of Coverage and Acquisition:** The dispositive portion of the prior decision was amended to *explicitly require compliance* with all legal requirements pertaining to the giving of Notices of Coverage (NOC) and Notices of Acquisition (NOA).

**Obligations:**

*   **DAR's Obligation to Issue Proper Notices:** The DAR has a legal obligation to serve separate NOCs and NOAs in compliance with due process requirements. This is directly mandated by the amended decision and is a condition precedent to acquiring the land.
*   **Respondents' Obligation to Cooperate:** While not explicitly stated, the respondents have an implied obligation to cooperate reasonably with the DAR during the acquisition process, including providing necessary information.

**Liabilities:**

*   **DAR's Potential Liability for Non-Compliance:** Failure by the DAR to comply with the notice requirements exposes the agency to potential legal challenges, including injunctions or petitions for certiorari, potentially delaying or preventing the acquisition.
*   **Respondents' Potential Loss of Land:** Upon proper compliance by the DAR, the respondents are subject to the loss of the subject land due to the acquisition for agrarian reform purposes.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Challenges:** Respondents may raise procedural challenges if they believe the DAR has not strictly complied with the notice requirements or other procedural safeguards related to land valuation and compensation.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** Disagreements over the valuation of the land could lead to protracted legal battles.
*   **Beneficiary Disputes:** Challenges may arise regarding the qualification of the intended beneficiaries.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Roxas & Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Cited by the respondents as a basis for requiring separate Notices of Coverage and Acquisition. This case underscores the importance of strict compliance with due process requirements in land acquisition.
*   **Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) (RA 6657):**  The entire proceeding is rooted in CARL and its implementing rules, particularly sections concerning land acquisition and distribution. Compliance with this law is crucial.
*   **Amendments and Revisions to CARL:**  Any amendments to RA 6657 and related regulations pertaining to notice requirements, land valuation, and compensation are also relevant.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Compliance with all requirements in connection with the giving of the Notices of Coverage and Notices of Acquisition as provided by law":** While seemingly straightforward, this clause necessitates careful interpretation of all relevant agrarian reform laws, rules, and regulations. The specific requirements and the DAR's adherence to them are potential sources of contention.

**Legal Advice:**

Prior to engaging in any further action related to land acquisition, the DAR should conduct a thorough review of all existing laws, rules, regulations, and relevant case law to ensure they are compliant with the mandate set forth by the Court. Special attention should be paid to compliance with the notice requirements, land valuation, and compensation procedures.
