## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Glasgow Credit and Collection Services, Inc. and Citystate Savings Bank, Inc.

**Case:** G.R. No. 170281, January 18, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order dismissing a complaint for civil forfeiture.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:**  Civil forfeiture complaint filed by the Republic of the Philippines (represented by AMLC) against Glasgow Credit and Collection Services, Inc. (Glasgow) and Citystate Savings Bank, Inc. (CSBI) to forfeit funds in Glasgow's account at CSBI (CA-005-10-000121-5) based on suspected violations of RA 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001), as amended.
*   **Grounds for Forfeiture:** Allegations of Glasgow engaging in unlawful activities (estafa and violation of the Securities Regulation Code) and money laundering based on Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) filed and AMLC resolutions.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   RTC initially issued a TRO and preliminary injunction freezing Glasgow's account.
    *   Summons to Glasgow returned "unserved."
    *   Republic sought alias summons and leave to serve summons by publication.
    *   RTC archived the case, then reinstated it, but did not act on the motion for service by publication.
    *   Glasgow filed a Motion to Dismiss based on lack of jurisdiction, prematurity/failure to state a cause of action, and failure to prosecute.
    *   RTC granted the Motion to Dismiss based on improper venue, insufficiency of the complaint, and failure to prosecute.
*   **RTC Dismissal Grounds:**
    *   **Improper Venue:** RTC held that the venue should have been Pasig City, where CSBI is located.
    *   **Insufficiency of Complaint:** RTC implied lack of cause of action due to absence of prior criminal conviction for the predicate offenses (estafa/Securities Regulation Code violation).
    *   **Failure to Prosecute:** RTC faulted the Republic for failure to serve summons.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the RTC dismissal, holding:
    *   **Proper Venue:** Venue was proper in RTC Manila, as it falls within the National Capital Judicial Region (NCJR) where the monetary instrument is located, in line with A.M. No. 05-11-04-SC, the Rule of Procedure in Cases of Civil Forfeiture.
    *   **Sufficient Complaint:** The complaint alleged all elements required under Section 4, Title II of A.M. No. 05-11-04-SC.  Specifically, the complaint contained names/addresses, description of the proceeds with particularity (account number/amount), and specific provisions of RA 9160 allegedly violated, and reliefs prayed for.  A prior criminal conviction for the predicate offense is *not* a prerequisite for civil forfeiture (Sec. 27 of Rule of Procedure in Cases of Civil Forfeiture).
    *   **No Failure to Prosecute:** The Republic actively sought to serve summons, including seeking leave to serve by publication. Delay was partly due to Glasgow's failure to update its address.
*   **Action In Rem**: Civil forfeiture is an action in rem, so the court can obtain jurisdiction through jurisdiction over the res (account being forfeited) not the person (Glasgow). Service by publication allowed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Glasgow:**  Obligated to respond to the civil forfeiture complaint.  Potential liability: forfeiture of funds in the subject account.
*   **CSBI:** Obligated to comply with court orders regarding the account. Subject to the preliminary injunction and TRO.
*   **Republic/AMLC:** Obligated to prove the allegations in the civil forfeiture complaint, specifically demonstrating the link between the funds in the account and unlawful activities/money laundering.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Service by Publication:** While allowed, the cost of publication cannot exceed a certain percentage of the assets to be forfeited per Sec. 8, Title II of the Rule of Procedure in Cases of Civil Forfeiture
*   **Tracing & Proving the Link:** Republic/AMLC must establish a clear and convincing link between the funds in the account and the alleged unlawful activities/money laundering for the forfeiture to succeed.
*   **Future Arguments on "Unlawful Activities":** Glasgow could argue that the identified predicate offenses (estafa, violations of Securities Regulation Code) were incorrectly classified as "unlawful activities" as defined by RA 9160, as amended.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001), as amended:** The primary statute governing the case.
