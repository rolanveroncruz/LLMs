## Legal Document Summary: *Domingo Naldo, Jr., et al. v. Corporate Protection Services, Phils., Inc., et al.* (G.R. No. 243139, April 03, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision that upheld the NLRC's finding of no illegal dismissal, but remanded for determination of monetary claims.

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioners were constructively dismissed and are entitled to backwages, damages, and attorney's fees; and the validity and legality of the quitclaims signed.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Domingo Naldo, Jr., et al. (Security Guards)
*   **Respondents:** Corporate Protection Services, Phils., Inc. (CORPS) and/or Buddy Robrigado and Benjamin Sesgundo (Employers)

**Background:** Petitioners filed a complaint for underpayment of wages, nonpayment of benefits, and ultimately, constructive illegal dismissal. They initially filed a Request for Assistance (RFA) with the NCMB through SEnA. During conciliation, CORPS offered checks for trust fund and cash bond savings, contingent on the petitioners signing resignation letters and quitclaims. Petitioners complied, relying on assurances that other money claims would be settled later. These claims never materialized and the employees are no longer employed..

**Court's Holding:** Constructive dismissal affirmed due to deceit/fraud in obtaining resignations and quitclaims.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Voluntary Resignation:** Court reiterated the test of constructive dismissal: whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up their employment under the circumstances. Employer bears burden to prove voluntary resignation. *Doble, Jr. v. ABB, Inc.* (810 Phil. 210 (2017))*
*   **Quitclaims/Releases:** Scrutinized with disfavor, especially if circumstances suggest circumvention of legal procedures and evasion of legitimate claims. Employer has the burden to prove the quitclaim constitutes a credible and reasonable settlement of what an employee is entitled to recover. *Land and Housing Development Corp. v. Esquillo* (508 Phil. 478 (2005)) and *F.F. Cruz & Co., Inc. v. Galandez* (856 Phil. 150 (2019))*
*   **Forum Shopping:** Availing of SEnA is not considered forum shopping, as it is a mandatory prerequisite before filing a labor complaint with the NLRC under the Labor Code, as amended by RA 10396. *London v. Baguio Country Club Corp.* (439 Phil. 487 (2002)) *Heirs of Mampo v. Morada* (888 Phil. 583 (2020))
*   **Remedies for Illegal Dismissal:** Illegally dismissed employee is entitled to (a) backwages and (b) reinstatement, or separation pay if reinstatement is not viable. Moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees may also be awarded if dismissal is attended by bad faith or fraud, or oppression. *Abbott Laboratories, Philippines v. Alcaraz* (714 Phil. 510 (2013))* and *Symex Security Services, Inc. v. Rivera, Jr.* (820 Phil. 653 (2017))

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code of the Philippines
*   Republic Act No. 10396 (Strengthening Conciliation-Mediation)
*   New Civil Code Article 22
*   DOLE Department Order No. (DO) 107-10, Series of 2010

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Computation of Monetary Awards:** The case is remanded to the Labor Arbiter for a revised comprehensive computation of the monetary awards. This may lead to further disputes regarding the specific amounts due to each petitioner, including the exact period for backwages.

**Key Holdings:**

1.  Petitioners are not guilty of forum shopping.
2.  Quitclaims signed by petitioners are void due to deceit and fraud by CORPS.
3.  Petitioners were constructively dismissed by CORPS, as their resignation letters were obtained through fraudulent misrepresentation.

**Outcomes Ordered:**

*   Reinstatement of Petitioners
*   Payment of backwages, including legally mandated 13th-month pay, from the time they were illegally dismissed on March 10, 2015 until the finality of the ruling.
*   Overtime pay, holiday pay, rest day premium, and service incentive leave pay pursuant to the Decision dated December 27, 2016, unless the same were already paid to petitioners in full.
*   PHP 50,000.00 as moral damages
*   PHP 20,000.00 as exemplary damages
*   Attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award due to petitioners.
*   Legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of the Decision until full payment.
