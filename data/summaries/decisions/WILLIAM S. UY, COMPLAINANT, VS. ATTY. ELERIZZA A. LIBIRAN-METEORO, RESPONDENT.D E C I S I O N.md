## Legal Document Summary - A.C. No. 13368

**Case:** *William S. Uy vs. Atty. Elerizza A. Libiran-Meteoro*

**Issue:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Libiran-Meteoro for gross misconduct, specifically issuing bouncing checks and failing to update IBP records.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Gross Misconduct (Canon II, Sections 1 & 2, CPRA):** Atty. Libiran-Meteoro found guilty of gross misconduct for issuing two RCBC Savings Bank checks that were dishonored due to "ACCOUNT CLOSED" and "DAIF," violating Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law).
*   Issuance of the unfunded checks was deemed "unlawful," "dishonest," and "deceitful," per *Saladaga v. Astorga* (748 Phil. 1 (2014)). The Court notes the checks were issued with the assurance that funds were available, constituting a misrepresentation. See, *Ong v. Atty. Delos Santos* (728 Phil. 332 (2014)) where lawyer had to obey constiution and laws.
*   **Violation of IBP Rules (Section 19, Revised IBP By-Laws):**  Atty. Libiran-Meteoro found guilty of violating IBP rules by failing to report her change of address, causing delays in the disciplinary proceedings. The Court notes she moved from an address as early as 2006, failing to report this.
*   **Sanctions:** Disbarment from the practice of law and name stricken from the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately, due to the gross misconduct. A fine of PHP 35,000.00 is imposed for violating IBP rules and issuances.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty to uphold the law and maintain honesty and integrity as a member of the Bar.
*   Obligation to report changes of address to the IBP.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of gross misconduct and violation of IBP rules. The Court finds the lawyer unfit to continue in the profession.
*   **No Civil Liability Adjudicated:** The IBP's prior recommendation for the respondent to pay PHP 245,000 was removed as such monetary claims should be litigated through a separate civil action.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Canon II, Sections 1 & 2, CPRA:** Basis for finding of gross misconduct.
*   **Canon VI, Sections 33, 34(c), 35(a), 37, 38(b)(1), 39 CPRA:** Defines offenses and penalties.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22:** Bouncing Checks Law.
*   **Revised IBP By-Laws, Section 19:** Obligation to report address changes.
*   ***Saladaga v. Astorga*** (748 Phil. 1 (2014)): Defines "unlawful," "dishonest," and "deceitful" conduct.
*   ***Ong v. Atty. Delos Santos*** (728 Phil. 332 (2014)): Lawyer's duty to be aware of the objectives of B.P. Blg 22.
*   ***Barrientos v. Atty. Libiran-Meteoro*** (480 Phil. 661 (2004)): Prior disciplinary case against Respondent for similar conduct (issuing bouncing checks) used as an aggravating factor.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Disbarment:** The most significant risk and outcome of the proceedings. This is a severe consequence that is based on the totality of the facts, notably her previous infractions and the current violation. The court considers this appropriate due to a propensity to defraud people, see *Juni v. Atty. Juni, A.C. No. 11599, August 3, 2021*.
*   **Due Process Concerns (Addressed):** Although Atty. Libiran-Meteoro could not be located, the court determined she was afforded due process as she was given multiple opportunities to respond.

**Ambiguities & Open Issues:**

*   The document does not specify a timeline for payment of the fine imposed for violating IBP rules.
