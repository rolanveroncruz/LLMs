## Legal Document Summary - *Asilo v. Gonzales-Betic* (G.R. No. 232269)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Recognition of a Foreign Divorce Decree (Hong Kong) under Article 26(2) of the Family Code.

**Key Issue:** Whether a foreign divorce decree obtained by a Filipino spouse can be recognized in the Philippines, enabling the Filipino spouse to remarry and revert to her maiden name. More specifically, whether the lower courts seriously erred when they denied the Petition for Recognition of the Foreign Decree due to the failure to prove Hong Kong law and due to the divorce having been obtained by the Filipino spouse.

**Ruling:** Appeal denied. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the petition for certiorari, effectively upholding the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of the Petition for Recognition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 26(2) of the Family Code:** Allows a Filipino citizen to remarry if a valid foreign divorce is obtained by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry.
*   **Rule 39, Section 48 of the Rules of Court:** Foreign judgments are presumptive evidence of a right but can be repelled by evidence of lack of jurisdiction, lack of notice, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake.
*   **Rule 108:** Provides a remedy to seek to establish a status, a right, or a particular fact.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Properly Plead and Prove Foreign Law:** A key deficiency was the failure to allege and prove the *national law* of the *alien spouse* (Tommy Wayne Appling), demonstrating that it recognizes the Hong Kong divorce decree and permits him to remarry. The pleading was silent on his nationality.
*   **Procedural Deficiencies:** The Petitioner initially pursued an incorrect remedy (certiorari instead of ordinary appeal) against the RTC ruling, contributing to the finality of the lower court's denial.
*   **Risk of Res Judicata:** While the SC notes that denial of a petition for recognition of foreign judgment pertaining to a person's status will not constitute res judicata, the delay and expense could have been avoided with proper initial filings and remedy.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic v. Manalo (831 Phil. 33 (2018)):** Clarifies that a Filipino spouse who initiates a foreign divorce proceeding can also benefit from Article 26(2) of the Family Code.
*   **Fujiki v. Marinay (712 Phil. 524 (2013)):** Referenced by the Petitioner, but distinguished by the OSG.
*   **Republic v. Orbecido (509 Phil. 108 (2005)):** Referenced by the Petitioner.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Sections 24 and 25:** States that in Our jurisdiction that the foreign judgment and the applicable national law must be admitted in evidence and proven as a fact.
*   **Rivera v. Republic, G.R. No. 238259 (Notice), February 17, 2021; Kondo v. Civil Registrar General, 872 Phil. 251 (2020) [Per J. Lazaro-Javier, First Division]; Mora√±a v. Republic, 867 Phil. 578 (2019) [Per J. Lazaro-Javier, First Division]; Nullada v. Civil Registrar of Manila, 846 Phil. 96 (2019) [Per J. Reyes, Jr., Third Division]; Juego-Sakai v. Republic, 836 Phil. 810 (2018) [Per J. Peralta, Second Division]; Morisono v. Morisono, 834 Phil. 823 (2018) [Per J. Perlas-Bernabe, Second Division]; and Republic v. Manalo, 831 Phil. 33 (2018) [Per J. Peralta, En Banc].**: Recent jurisprudence where the Court opted to remand the case to the lower court for reception of evidence concerning the national law of the alien spouse.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While *Manalo* clarifies the Filipino spouse's right to initiate divorce, the requirement for pleading and proving the alien spouse's *nationality* and *national law* enabling remarriage remains crucial.
*   The decision emphasizes that Tommy's *national law* and *nationality* should have been pleaded, not just argued. The Court rejected reliance on his subsequent marriage certificate as *proof* of his nationality at the time of the *divorce*.

**Legal Precision & Key Takeaways:**

*   A petition for recognition of a foreign divorce decree *must* explicitly state the alien spouse's nationality at the time of the divorce and plead his national law recognizes the divorce, capacitating him to remarry. This is an "ultimate fact."
*   Failure to properly plead and prove *both* the foreign judgment and the alien spouse's national law is fatal to the petition.
*   Remarriage of the alien spouse in the Philippines is *not* sufficient proof of recognition of the foreign judgment.
*   Choosing the correct procedural remedy and meeting deadlines is critical.

**Recommendations:**

Advise the client that she may refile the Petition for Recognition. Ensure that the new petition explicitly alleges the nationality of the alien spouse at the time of the divorce, and plead his national law recognizes the divorce, capacitating him to remarry. Obtain official documentation of the alien spouse's national law. Ensure proper compliance with procedural rules.
