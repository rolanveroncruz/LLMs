**Case Summary: *People v. Antonio*, G.R. No. 223113 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for rape under Art. 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Marcelo Antonio (Appellant) was charged with rape, along with co-accused Augusto Gonzales and Esmenio Pader, of a 15-year-old minor ("AAA") on December 13, 1999, acting in conspiracy.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** AAA testified that Appellant, Augusto, and Esmenio dragged her to a sandpile where they forcibly removed her clothes. Appellant and Esmenio pinned her down while Augusto removed her clothes. Appellant kissed her and penetrated her vagina. Physical examination confirmed hymenal lacerations, bleeding, and presence of spermatozoa.
*   **Defense's Version:** Appellant claimed he was with Augusto, Esmenio, and Marlon, and AAA followed them. Augusto and AAA disappeared. Appellant later found Augusto on top of AAA and was attacked and lost consciousness.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC convicted Antonio, giving credence to AAA's testimony and finding conspiracy. The CA affirmed the RTC, finding all elements of rape proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the conviction, finding AAA's testimony credible and corroborated by medical evidence.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant has a continuing obligation to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellant has a monetary obligation to pay the victim, "AAA."

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape under Art. 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353), resulting in a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Civil liability to "AAA," including:
    *   P75,000.00 Civil Indemnity
    *   P75,000.00 Moral Damages
    *   P75,000.00 Exemplary Damages
    *   Interest on all damages at 6% per annum from the finality of the Resolution until fully paid, pursuant to *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* (716 Phil. 267 (2013)).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further appeals are unlikely to succeed given the factual findings of the lower courts and the well-established jurisprudence on the credibility of rape victims, especially minors.
*   Non-payment of monetary obligations could result in further legal action, including the potential for asset seizure.

*   **Article 266-A(1), Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines and penalizes rape.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The court noted minor inconsistencies between testimonies of the victim and other witnesses. However, they were deemed immaterial and did not affect the outcome of the case.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court has upheld the conviction based on the RTC and CA's findings. The Court has increased the damage amounts to align with the *Jugueta* ruling. There are no apparent grounds for further appeal.
