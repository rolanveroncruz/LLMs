**Case Summary: *Maca-Angcos Alawiya y Abdul, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. No. 164170, April 16, 2009)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the Secretary of Justice's (SOJ) reversal of the State Prosecutor's finding of probable cause for kidnapping for ransom against respondent police officers, and in requiring prior Ombudsman approval for filing the information.

**Facts:** Petitioners alleged they were kidnapped for ransom by respondent police officers. The State Prosecutor filed an Information for Kidnapping for Ransom (Art. 267, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659). The SOJ reversed, finding the incident a "bungled buy-bust" and ordering the Information's withdrawal, based partially on a witness affidavit contradicting the kidnapping claim. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, citing the necessity of prior Ombudsman approval under OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**
*   **Article 267, Revised Penal Code:** Defines kidnapping and serious illegal detention, with death penalty applicable when committed for ransom.
*   **OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001:** Outlines jurisdiction and control of the Office of the Ombudsman over preliminary investigations and prosecution of offenses committed by public officers in relation to their office.
*   **Power of Control:** The Secretary of Justice's power of direct control and supervision over prosecutors allowing them to affirm, nullify, reverse or modify their rulings.
*   **Role of the Trial Court:** The Trial Court is mandated to independently evaluate or assess the existence of probable cause and it may either agree or disagree with the recommendation of the Secretary of Justice.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**
*   **Respondent Police Officers:** Facing potential criminal liability under Article 267 for kidnapping for ransom if probable cause is established.
*   **State Prosecutor:** Subject to administrative review by the Secretary of Justice regarding their resolution finding probable cause.
*   **Petitioners:** Risk of dismissal of the criminal case against the police officers if the Trial Court finds no probable cause.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Art. 267, Revised Penal Code (RA 7659):** Statutory basis for the kidnapping charge.
*   **OMB-DOJ Joint Circular No. 95-001:** Addressed the issue of jurisdiction between the Ombudsman and the DOJ in cases involving public officials.
*   ***Honasan II v. The Panel of Investigating Prosecutors of the Department of Justice, G.R. No. 159747, 13 April 2004, 427 SCRA 46:*** Confirmed that the Ombudsman's power to investigate public officers is concurrent, not exclusive.
*   ***Marcelo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 106695, 4 August 1994, 235 SCRA 39:*** Affirmed the SOJ's power to review prosecutorial resolutions even after an information is filed.
*   ***Crespo v. Mogul, 235 Phil. 465, 476 (1987):*** Delineated the stages of criminal prosecution, emphasizing the court's control after the Information is filed.
*   ***People v. Mapalao, 274 Phil. 354 (1991):*** Discussed the standing of an accused who is at large to seek relief from the court.
*   **Sec. 15, Republic Act No. 6770 (RA 6770):** Outlines the powers, functions and duties of the Office of the Ombudsman

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **"In Relation to Office":** Interpretation of whether the alleged kidnapping was "in relation to office" for purposes of OMB-DOJ Circular 95-001. The SOJ argued it was, requiring Ombudsman approval; Petitioners argued otherwise.
*   The Secretary of Justice's determination that the alleged incident was a "bungled buy-bust operation" versus the State Prosecutor's finding of kidnapping for ransom.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, holding that:
1.  Prior Ombudsman approval was *not* required, as the Ombudsman's power is concurrent (citing *Honasan II*).
2.  The SOJ had the power to review the State Prosecutor's resolution (citing *Marcelo* and *Crespo*).
3.  *People v. Mapalao* was inapplicable as the accused were not yet under the custody of the law.

**Remand:** The SC remanded the case to the trial court to *independently* assess probable cause for kidnapping for ransom, regardless of the SOJ's resolution.

**Potential Risks Moving Forward:**  The Trial Court could still find no probable cause, resulting in dismissal of the kidnapping charges.  However, if the Trial Court finds probable cause, the respondent police officers will be prosecuted.
