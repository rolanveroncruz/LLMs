## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Jose Sy Bang v. Rolando Sy*; *Iluminada Tan v. Bartolome Sy*

**Case Citations:** G.R. No. 114217, October 13, 2009; G.R. No. 150797, October 13, 2009 (Consolidated)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing CA decisions regarding a partition case and a related guardianship proceeding.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners in G.R. No. 114217:** Heirs of Jose Sy Bang, Heirs of Julian Sy, and Oscar Sy (primarily challenging the Third Partial Decision and appointment of a receiver).
*   **Respondents in G.R. No. 114217:** Rolando Sy, et al. (children of Sy Bang with Rosita Ferrera-Sy).
*   **Petitioners in G.R. No. 150797:** Iluminada Tan, Spouses Julian Sy and Rosa Tan, Zenaida Tan, and Ma. Emma Sy (challenging the Guardianship court's authority to enforce widow's allowance payment).
*   **Respondents in G.R. No. 150797:** Bartolome Sy, et al.

**Background:**
*   Civil Case No. 8578: Complaint for partition of the estate of Sy Bang filed in 1980. Sy Bang died intestate in 1971, leaving real and personal properties, including businesses.
*   Numerous partial decisions were issued, including a Third Partial Decision declaring certain properties as belonging to the estate and identifying the heirs.
*   Rosita Ferrera-Sy, Sy Bang's second wife, filed for widow's allowance.

**Key Provisions & Issues (G.R. No. 114217):**

1.  **Third Partial Decision:** Petitioners challenged the validity, arguing violation of due process as they claimed insufficient opportunity to present evidence.
    *   **Court Ruling:** Upheld the CA's finding that the Third Partial Decision was a valid "several judgment" under Rule 36, Section 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. The court held that the issues related to specific properties held by some petitioners could be resolved separately from other properties, and the judgment against one did not necessarily affect others. *Fernando v. Santamaria, 487 Phil. 351, 357 (2004)* cited in relation to several judgments.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Rule 36, Section 4, Rules of Court.
    *   **Risk:** The petitioners were prematurely bound to the Third Partial Decision. The Sy Bang estate cannot be partitioned or distributed until the final determination of the extent of the estate and only until it is shown that the obligations under Rule 90, Section 1, have been settled.
2.  **Appointment of Receiver:** Petitioners alleged the appointment was made without a hearing and without showing necessity.
    *   **Court Ruling:** Upheld the CA's finding that the appointment was proper to preserve properties under litigation, as supported by evidence of mismanagement.
3.  **Cancellation of Lis Pendens:** Petitioners challenged the cancellation as improper.
    *   **Court Ruling:** Upheld the cancellation, finding evidence that the notice was for the purpose of harassment and that the interests of Oscar Sy, who caused the notice to be annotated, was only 1/14 of the assessed value of the property. Bond posted to protect any interest.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Section 77, Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)
    *   **Case Law:** *Romero v. Court of Appeals, 497 Phil. 775, 784-785 (2005)* cited regarding the effect of *lis pendens*.
4. **Payment of Widow's Allowance**: the trial court granted the payment of the widow's allowance and ordered petitioners to pay it but the petitioners alleged the the motion was filed during a special civil action for partition and that the allowance should be taken from the "common mass of property" during the liquidation of the inventoried properties
**Key Provisions & Issues (G.R. No. 150797):**

1.  **Jurisdiction of Guardianship Court:** The core issue was whether the Guardianship court had jurisdiction to enforce payment of widow's allowance ordered by the Supreme Court in the partition case.
    *   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, holding that the Guardianship court exceeded its jurisdiction.  Citing Rule 83, Sec. 3, of the Rules of Court and Article 188 of the Civil Code, the Court emphasized that only the court hearing the settlement of the estate has jurisdiction to direct the payment of widow's allowance.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Rule 83, Sec. 3, Rules of Court; Article 188, Civil Code.
    *   **Case Law:** *Paciente v. Dacuycuy, etc., et al., 200 Phil. 403, 408-409 (1982)* and *Gomez v. Imperial, 134 Phil. 858, 864 (1968)* cited to emphasize the limited jurisdiction of the guardianship court.
2. "From the estate of Sy Bang": The petition argued that the trial court had jurisdiction only to determine whether or not Rosita was incompetent and not to modify the Supreme Court's Order regarding payment of widow's allowance
**Other Unresolved Incidents**:
1. Petitioners have been ordered to pay Rosita Ferrera-Sy her monthly widow's allowance, which they grudgingly complied with only upon the threat of incarceration
2. Petitioners filed a Motion to include Rosalino Sy, Bartolome Sy, Rolando Sy, and Heirs of Enrique Sy as Likewise Liable for the Payment of Widow's Allowance as Heirs of Sy Bang. This motion was denied.
3. Court found petitioners to be challenging every directive and abused legal/court processes

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   The determination of which properties definitively belong to the Estate of Sy Bang remains contentious, delaying the final partition.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **For Petitioners:** Continued exposure to contempt charges and potential sanctions for non-compliance with widow's allowance payments and obstructionist tactics.
*   **For Respondents:** Further delays in settling the estate and receiving their rightful shares due to the protracted litigation.
*   There is a risk that the case will continue to be delayed for an extended period.
* There is a potential for sanctions to be charged against the petitioners and charged with treble costs

**Outcome:**

*   G.R. No. 114217: Petition DENIED. The CA decision upholding the Third Partial Decision was affirmed.
*   G.R. No. 150797: Petition GRANTED. The CA decision affirming the Guardianship court's order was reversed.
*   The Regional Trial Court of Lucena City was directed to hear and decide Civil Case No. 8578 with dispatch. Treble costs awarded against the petitioners.
*   The Court denied the Motion to include Rosalino Sy, Bartolome Sy, Rolando Sy, and Heirs of Enrique Sy as Likewise Liable for the Payment of Widow's Allowance as Heirs of Sy Bang.
