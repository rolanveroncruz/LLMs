## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 175929

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the CA and RTC convictions for Murder.

**Case Summary:** Accused-appellant Rommel dela Cruz was convicted of murder for the fatal stabbing of his cousin, Rafael Santarin. The prosecution's case rested primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Manny Viscaya, who positively identified Dela Cruz as the assailant. Dela Cruz pleaded denial and alibi.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Positive Identification:** The Court upheld the lower courts' reliance on Viscaya's credible eyewitness testimony. Positive identification outweighed the accused's alibi and denial. Cites *People v. Jackson*, G.R. No. 131842.
*   **Treachery:** The Court found treachery to be present as the attack was sudden, unexpected, and from behind, giving the victim no opportunity to defend himself, fulfilling the conditions set in *People v. Azugue*, G.R. No. 110098.
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** Dela Cruz's actions after the incident (leaving the scene, sleeping elsewhere, fleeing to Cebu and later to other provinces) were construed as flight, indicative of guilt, according to *People v. Cahindo*, G.R. No. 121178.
*   **Sufficiency of Information:** The Court held that the Information adequately informed the accused of the charge of murder, even though it did not use the words "qualifying" or "qualified by" in relation to the aggravating circumstances, in line with the ruling in *People v. Aquino*, 435 Phil. 417. The Information clearly stated the "treachery and evident premeditation".

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve the penalty of *Reclusion Perpetua*, with all accessory penalties.
*   Accused is obligated to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   P50,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   P20,900.00 as actual damages
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages
    *   P25,000.00 as exemplary damages

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liability:** Obligation to pay damages to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **None:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decisions. Any further appeal will have to prove a violation of the constitution.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Rule 110, Sections 8 & 9, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Requirements for Information content, including specifying qualifying and aggravating circumstances.
*   **People v. Aquino, 435 Phil. 417:** Regarding the necessary allegations of qualifying circumstances in an Information.
*   **People v. Azugue, G.R. No. 110098:** Defines elements to sustain a finding of treachery.
*   **People v. Jackson, G.R. No. 131842:** Reiterates that positive identification prevails over denial and alibi.
*   **People v. Cahindo, G.R. No. 121178:** Clarifies that the flight of an accused is an indication of guilt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The accused challenged the lack of specific language ("qualifying") in the Information, the court held that the explicit mention of the circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery are sufficent for conviction of Murder.

**Note:** The court affirmed the lower court rulings due to the reliable eyewitness testimony, established treachery, the accused's flight, and the adequate information provided to the accused. The court finds that a crime of murder was sufficiently proven.
