## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Arces, Jr.*, G.R. No. 225624

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for rape under Article 266-A, par. 1(d), in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provision:** The appellant was charged with and convicted of raping a nine-year-old child.

**Central Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding Arces guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

**Summary of Facts:**
*   Complainant AAA alleged two incidents of rape in April 2006 by her uncle Arces. First incident involved penetration, second involved simulated act.
*   AAA disclosed the incidents to her mother nearly two years later, following an argument between her mother and Arces's sisters.
*   Medical examination showed an intact hymen and no signs of penetration.
*   Arces presented an alibi corroborated by a witness, claiming he was at sea during the alleged incidents. He also presented evidence of motive for false accusation.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted Arces based on reasonable doubt.

**Key Arguments for Reversal:**
1.  **Doubtful Testimony of AAA:** AAA's indifferent demeanor, lack of emotion, and questionable actions after the alleged incidents (especially the second incident) raise significant doubts about the credibility of her testimony. The court emphasized the "straightforward, clear, positive, and convincing" standard for conviction solely based on complainant testimony, citing *People v. Bermejo, 692 Phil. 373 (2012)*.
2.  **Unexplained Delay in Reporting:** The nearly two-year delay in reporting the alleged rapes, without sufficient explanation, discredited AAA's claims. The Court cited *People v. Relorcasa, 296-A Phil. 24 (1993)*, emphasizing that unreasonable and unexplained delay casts doubt on the veracity of a rape charge.  The court acknowledges precedents where convictions were upheld despite long reporting delays but distinguishes this case due to lack of explanation for the delay.
3.  **Alibi and Medical Report Considered:** While alibi is traditionally weak, the Court noted that when the prosecution's case is weak, a corroborated alibi should be thoroughly considered, citing *People v. Manambit, 338 Phil. 57 (1997)*. The intact hymen, though not conclusive, further weakened the prosecution's case, citing *People v. Amarela and Racho, G.R. Nos. 225642-43, 17 January 2018.*
4.  **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterated that the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and its case cannot be strengthened by the weakness of the defense, citing *People v. Amarela and Racho, G.R. Nos. 225642-43, 17 January 2018*.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Article 266-A, par. 1(d), in relation to Article 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code (Rape)
*   *People v. Bermejo, 692 Phil. 373 (2012)* (Credibility of complainant testimony in rape cases)
*   *People v. Relorcasa, 296-A Phil. 24 (1993)* (Impact of delay in reporting rape)
*   *People v. Manambit, 338 Phil. 57 (1997)* (Alibi defense)
*   *People v. Amarela and Racho, G.R. Nos. 225642-43, 17 January 2018* (Medical report's corroborative value and burden of proof)

**Obligations:** The State has the obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities:**  Appellant was initially found liable for *reclusion perpetua* and damages. This was overturned.

**Potential Risks:**
*   The case highlights the difficulty in prosecuting child rape cases when based primarily on the victim's testimony.
*   It underscores the importance of prompt reporting and the need for clear, consistent, and credible testimony.
*   The acquittal may be perceived negatively by the public and advocacy groups for victims of sexual abuse.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The weight given to the medical report and the delay in reporting are particularly contentious, as the court acknowledges that neither factor is automatically disqualifying, but in conjunction with the perceived inconsistencies in the victim's testimony, create reasonable doubt.  Whether the alibi should have been considered more significantly.
