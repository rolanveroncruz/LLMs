## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dacoba*, G.R. Nos. 121995-96 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Joint Decision convicting Francisco Dacoba (Accused-Appellant) of two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** RTC found Accused-Appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping Jonalyn Andaya on two occasions (November 7 & 12, 1992).
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each offense, along with legal disqualifications and an indemnity of P60,000.00 to the victim.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Victim's testimony was deemed credible and consistent, detailing the two instances of rape. Corroborated by the testimony of Josie Andaya (victim's aunt) and medical certificate indicating vaginal lacerations and hematoma.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Accused-Appellant pleaded denial and alibi, claiming the victim fabricated the charges due to family disapproval of his marriage or to extort money.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the RTC decision in *toto*.  Found the prosecution had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay the indemnity of P60,000.00 to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for the two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Financial liability to the victim for damages.
*   Legal disqualifications stemming from the conviction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness Testimony:** The case heavily relies on the complainant's credibility.  The decision emphasizes the trial court's assessment of her sincerity and candor.  While the Supreme Court deferred to the trial court's findings, such assessments are inherently subjective and potentially contestable, albeit unlikely given the affirmation.
*   **Defense Arguments of Fabrication/Extortion:** The defense's attempt to attribute the charges to ulterior motives (family feud, extortion) was rejected. However, future similar defenses could be raised in other cases, potentially requiring a more nuanced examination of the alleged motives.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The medical certificate supports the claim of sexual assault but is non-specific regarding the perpetrator. Reliance on medical evidence to confirm sexual intercourse, not specifically identification of the assailant.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the victim's credible testimony, corroborated by medical evidence, and dismissed the defense's weak alibi and unsubstantiated claims of fabrication. The decision reinforces the principle that in rape cases, a credible complainant's testimony can be sufficient for conviction. The risks are minimal as the decision has been finalized, but it could be used as precedent for future cases involving similar fact patterns and credibility assessments.
