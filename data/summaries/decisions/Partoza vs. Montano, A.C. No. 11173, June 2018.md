**Summary of A.C. No. 11173 (Re: CA-G.R. CV NO. 96282)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Claro Jordan M. Santamaria for willful disobedience to lawful orders of the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Facts:**

*   Spouses Partoza filed a civil case, dismissed by the RTC, appealed to the CA (CA-G.R. CV No. 96282).
*   Original counsel, Atty. Villanueva, filed a Notice of Appeal then Withdrawal of Appearance.
*   Atty. Santamaria filed Appellant's Brief.
*   The CA issued multiple Resolutions directing Atty. Villanueva to provide proof of Honnie Partoza's authority and conformity to the withdrawal, and directing Atty. Santamaria to file Entry of Appearance, client's conformity, and RTC Decision.
*   Atty. Santamaria failed to comply with *five* separate CA Resolutions.
*   The CA cited Atty. Santamaria for contempt and eventually dismissed the appeal.
*   The CA referred the matter to the IBP.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 44, Section 7 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Implicates submission of Appellant's Brief
*   **Section 20(b), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Duty of an attorney to respect courts.
*   **Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Uphold the law and promote respect for legal processes.
*   **Canon 11, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Maintain respect due to the courts and judicial officers.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension, including willful disobedience of a lawful order of a superior court.
*   Atty. Santamaria had an *obligation* to comply with the CA Resolutions, including filing an Entry of Appearance and client conformity, regardless of his perceived lack of "personality" to represent the clients due to the previous counsel's withdrawal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Atty. Santamaria's repeated failure to comply with CA Resolutions constitutes willful disobedience of lawful orders.
*   **Contempt of Court:** Already imposed by the CA (fine of P5,000.00).

**Risks:**

*   **Suspension from Practice:** The Supreme Court adopted the IBP's recommendation to suspend Atty. Santamaria from the practice of law for six (6) months. Repetition of similar conduct will be dealt with more severely.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 138, Rules of Court, Section 27:** Ground for disbarment/suspension.
*   **Cuizon v. Atty. Macalino, 477 Phil. 569, 571 (2004):** Recalcitrant lawyers face consequences.
*   **Salabao v. Villaruel, Jr., 767 Phil. 548, 553-554 (2015):** Lawyer's primary duty is to the administration of justice.
*   **Anudon v. Cefra, 753 Phil. 421, 431-433 (2015):**  Refusal to comply with court orders is disrespect.
*   **In Re: Resolution Dated August 14, 2013... v. Atty. Mortel, 791 Phil. 1 (2016):** Lawyer suspended for ignoring CA Resolutions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   Atty. Santamaria's defense that he believed he lacked "personality" to represent the clients is rejected. The SC implies that he should have clarified the situation with the CA, instead of ignoring the Resolutions.
*   Validity of Atty. Villanueva's Withdrawal of Appearance is questionable since the Court notes concerns about Honnie Partoza's authority and conformity. This added to the confusion, but does not excuse Atty. Santamaria's disregard of the court's directives.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Santamaria's suspension is upheld due to his willful disobedience of the CA's orders. The case underscores the importance of lawyers' duty to respect and comply with court directives, and emphasizes the serious consequences of ignoring such orders. The fact that the Court views the attorney's acts as a betrayal of the administration of justice further strengthens the decision.
