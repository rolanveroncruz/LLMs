**Legal Document Summary: *Median Container Corporation v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company***

**Case:** G.R. No. 166904, August 11, 2008 (583 Phil. 618)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing MCC's petition for certiorari, which in turn assailed the RTC's denial of MCC's Motion to Dismiss.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Sum of Money Complaint:** Metrobank filed a complaint for sum of money against MCC and spouses Ley due to MCC's failure to settle loan obligations.
2.  **Defective Verification and Certification Against Forum Shopping:** MCC argued that Atty. Mendoza lacked authority to sign the verification and certification on behalf of Metrobank *at the time* of signing. They assert that lack of authority is cause for dismissal under Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
    *   **Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the subsequent Board Resolution authorizing Atty. Mendoza *before* the actual filing of the complaint constituted *ratification* of his prior actions, curing any defect. SC cited *NEW CIVIL CODE Articles 1869 and 1910; Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. v. Linsangan* regarding ratification of agency.
3.  **Improper Service of Summons:** MCC claimed defective service of summons because the process server served it on Danilo Ong, an alleged former employee, not the General Manager, violating Rule 14, Section 11 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. This impacts the court's jurisdiction over MCC. MCC relied on *E.B. Villarosa & Partner Co., Ltd. v. Benito.*
    *   **Holding:** The SC upheld the CA's finding of proper service. Despite Ong allegedly being a former employee, the process server indicated service on the "General Manager." The SC doubted the validity of the submitted resignation documents based on signature discrepancies, suggesting possible misrepresentation. The court also noted that the process server went to the correct address. The court held a certificate of service is *prima facie* evidence per *R. Transport Corporation v. Court of Appeals.*
4.  **Jurisdiction:** MCC argued that lack of valid service meant the trial court lacked jurisdiction over its person.
    *   **Holding:** SC held that there was valid service, thus conferring jurisdiction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   MCC has an obligation to respond to the Sum of Money complaint.
*   MCC remains liable for the outstanding loan obligations to Metrobank, subject to the RTC's determination of the actual amount due.

**Potential Risks:**

*   MCC faces the risk of an adverse judgment for the outstanding loan amount plus interest, penalties, and costs.
*   The factual finding on service of summons binds MCC, precluding further challenges on jurisdictional grounds.
*   Failure to present original documents weakens MCC's claims. (*RULES OF COURT, Rule 130, Section 3, Rule 132, Section 20.*)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in the factual dispute over Danilo Ong's employment status at the time of service and the discrepancies in the signatures. This is not so much a contentious clause in the document itself, but in the factual matters presented.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Section 5 (Verification & Certification)**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Section 11 (Service upon domestic private juridical entity)**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 3, Rule 132, Section 20 (Best Evidence Rule)**
*   **NEW CIVIL CODE Articles 1869 and 1910 (Agency and Ratification)**
*   **E.B. Villarosa & Partner Co., Ltd. v. Benito (Improper service on branch manager)**
*   **R. Transport Corporation v. Court of Appeals (Prima facie effect of service)**
*   **Manila Memorial Park Cemetery, Inc. v. Linsangan (Ratification)**
*   **Shipside Incorporated v. Court of Appeals, 404 Phil. 981, 994 (2001), citation omitted. (Verification is a formal not jurisdictional requirement.)**

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding that the verification and certification issues were cured by ratification, and the service of summons was valid. The Court highlighted the *prima facie* validity of the process server's return and the dubious evidence presented by MCC to contradict it. MCC faces a strong likelihood of liability for the debt.
