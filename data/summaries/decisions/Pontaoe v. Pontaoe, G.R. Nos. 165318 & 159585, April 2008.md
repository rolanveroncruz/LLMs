**Case Summary: *Pontaoe v. Pontaoe*, G.R. No. 159585 and 165318**

This case involves consolidated petitions for review on certiorari regarding the validity of property transfers within the Pontaoe family. The core dispute concerns ownership of several parcels of land in Pangasinan, stemming from alleged conveyances involving Juan Pontaoe, Tomasa Aquino, and their children/grandchild (Teodora, Eduardo, Amando, and Dr. Alejandro).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Quieting of Title, Accounting, and Damages:** Teodora (and later, Eduardo) initially filed suit to quiet title, seeking an accounting and damages against Amando, alleging ownership based on deeds they claim vested title in them.
*   **Validity of Deeds:** The central legal question revolves around the validity of three key deeds:
    *   **Deed of Conveyance (Juan to Eduardo):** Found *invalid* by both the RTC and CA due to forgery.
    *   **Deed of Quitclaim (Dr. Alejandro to Eduardo):** Found *invalid* by both the RTC and CA due to forgery.
    *   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Tomasa to Teodora):**  Found *valid* by the CA, reversing the RTC, based on Tomasa's subsequent acquisition of the property from Dagupan Rural Bank after foreclosure.
*   **Forgery Claims:**  Amando and Dr. Alejandro claimed the signatures on the Deeds of Conveyance and Quitclaim were forged. The RTC and CA both agreed.
*   **Ownership of TCT No. 134602:** Disputed. Amando and Dr. Alejandro argued that the CA erred in declaring Teodora the absolute owner, alleging it was initially Juan's property and the parties stipulated to that effect. The CA reasoned Tomasa later became the owner after repurchasing the foreclosed property.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Prove Authenticity of Deeds:** Teodora and Eduardo, as proponents of the deeds, bore the burden to prove their authenticity.
*   **Potential Liability for Accounting:**  The original complaint sought an accounting. However, the focus shifted to title, and the scope of any potential accounting remains unclear from this summary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact of Forgery Findings:** The confirmation of the forgeries on the Deed of Conveyance and Quitclaim is highly detrimental to Eduardo's claims of ownership over the land covered by OCT No. 139, specifically one-half eastern portion of the property covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 139.
*   **Stipulation Issue:** The argument regarding the pre-trial stipulation admitting Juan's original ownership of TCT No. 134602 could be contentious, though the CAâ€™s finding that Tomasa became the owner after repurchasing the foreclosed property seems to overcome this argument.
*   **Lack of Handwriting Expert Testimony:** While the court can make its own determination, the absence of expert testimony on the forgery claims could be challenged, especially if the signatures are only facially dissimilar. The *Jimenez v. COMELEC* case clarifies that expert testimony is not indispensable.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 132, Section 22 of the Rules of Court:** Explicitly authorizes the court to compare disputed handwriting.
*   ***Jimenez v. Commission on Ecumenical Mission and Relations of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA***, G.R. No. 140472, June 10, 2002: Clarifies that handwriting expert opinions are not binding on the court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Scope of Accounting:** While the original complaint included a prayer for accounting, the actual accounting obligations, if any, are not clearly defined in this summary.
*   **Weight of Stipulation:** The effect of the pre-trial stipulation regarding original ownership of TCT No. 134602 is not entirely clear given the subsequent finding that Tomasa reacquired the property. Further investigation into the specific language of the stipulation is warranted.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *affirmed* the CA decision. Teodora is the absolute owner of the parcel covered by TCT No. 134602. The Deeds of Conveyance and Quitclaim are invalid due to forgery. The land of Juan Pontaoe and Alejandro Pontaoe were not validly conveyed to Petitioner Eduardo Pontaoe, and the deed of conveyance in favor of Eduardo Pontaoe is declared null and void.
