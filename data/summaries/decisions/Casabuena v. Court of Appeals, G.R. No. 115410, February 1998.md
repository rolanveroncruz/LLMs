## Legal Document Summary: *Casabuena v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 115410)

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership and possession of a 100 sq. m. lot in Manila, originally part of a city land reform program.

**Key Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Juan Casabuena, transferee of rights from Arsenia Benin, assignee of original grantee Ciriaco Urdaneta.
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Ciriaco and Ofelia Ipil-Urdaneta, original grantees under Manila's "Land of the Landless Program."
*   **Arsenia Benin:** Assignee of Urdaneta's rights, assignor to Casabuena.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Grant:** Urdaneta granted land under Manila's program, subject to a 40-year amortization and potential restrictions (non-alienation clause extended to 20 years after Release of Mortgage).
*   **Deed of Assignment (1965, 1967):** Urdaneta assigned rights to Benin to cover indebtedness. Initially, it was for half of the lot, later for the entire lot. Benin agreed to shoulder the City's amortization payments.
*   **Verbal Redemption Agreement:** Urdaneta purportedly retained the right to redeem the property within three years, failing which, Benin would have possession for fifteen years (without transfer of ownership).
*   **Assignment to Casabuena:** Benin transferred her "right, title, and interest" to the Casabuena brothers for a consideration.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Urdanetas:** Obligated to pay the City of Manila the amortization as per the original agreement.
*   **Benin:** Obligated to fulfill the original amortization obligations to the City after the assignment.
*   **Casabuena:** Claims right to possession based on the assignment from Benin, placing him against the Urdaneta's claim of ownership.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Assignment:** The core issue is whether the assignment could validly transfer ownership, given the potential restrictions imposed by the City's land reform program and the absence of any legal rights to do so.
*   **Nature of the Assignment:** Whether the assignment constituted a true transfer of ownership versus a security for indebtedness. The court determined it was only evidence of indebtedness.
*   **Verbal Redemption Agreement:** Enforceability of the verbal agreement regarding redemption and possession.
*   **Rent Collection by Casabuena:** Raises questions regarding the nature of his possession and whether he was a tenant, contradicting his claim of ownership through the assignment.
*   **Non-alienation Clause:** The extended 20-year non-alienation period could render any attempted transfer invalid.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2085 of the Civil Code:** regarding the essentials to the contracts of pledge and mortgage that the pledgor or mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing pledged or mortgaged.
*   **Civil Code Provisions on Assignment of Credit:** (implicitly referenced in the court's discussion).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Nyco Sales Corp. vs. BA Finance Corps.*** (200 SCRA 637 (1991)):  Establishes that assignment of credit involves no transfer of ownership but merely effects the transfer of rights.
*   ***Koa vs. Court of Appeals*** (219 SCRA 541 (1993)): Assignee subrogated to the rights and obligations of the assignor.
*   ***Gonzales vs. Land Bank of the Philippines*** (183 SCRA 520 (1990)): The act of assignment could not have operated to efface liens or restrictions burdening the right assigned.
*   ***Adlawan vs. Torres*** (233 SCRA 645 (1994)): By mortgaging a piece of property, a debtor merely subjects it to a lien but ownership thereof is not parted with.

**Court Ruling (Affirmed):**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the assignment to Benin was merely security for a debt and did not transfer ownership. The Casabuenas, as assignees of Benin, acquired no greater right than Benin possessed. The Urdanetas remain the rightful owners of the property.

**Legal Analysis:**

The court applied the principle that an assignee cannot acquire a greater right than the assignor (Benin), who was, at most, a creditor holding the property as security. The court's reasoning emphasizes the restrictions attached to the original grant under the land reform program, which the assignment could not circumvent. The extension of the non-alienation period appears to further undermine Casabuena's claim. Casabuena's claim fails because there was no valid transfer of rights from the Urdanetas that could transfer to Benin, and then to Casabuena.
