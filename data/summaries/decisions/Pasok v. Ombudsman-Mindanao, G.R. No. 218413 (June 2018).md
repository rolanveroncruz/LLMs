## Legal Document Summary: *Pasok v. Office of the Ombudsman*

**Case:** *Feliciano S. Pasok, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman–Mindanao and Rex Y. Dua* (G.R. No. 218413, June 06, 2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing Orders of the Office of the Ombudsman–Mindanao finding probable cause against the Petitioner.

**Key Provisions:**

*   The Office of the Ombudsman filed an information against Pasok for Malversation and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) based on irregularities in the implementation of several agricultural programs. Alleged irregularities included non-remittance of funds, non-delivery of goods to intended beneficiaries, and manipulation of the award of agricultural equipment.
*   Initially, Ombudsman found probable cause against Pasok but set aside the findings pending a report from the COA. After reviewing the COA report, the Ombudsman reinstated its finding of probable cause.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Pasok is obligated to face charges for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The element of Sec 3(e) of causing undue injury to the government or giving private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence is alleged to be met.
*   While Pasok has administrative liability for grave misconduct and serious dishonesty, this case concerns the criminal liability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** Potential conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, carrying penalties of imprisonment and disqualification from public office.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contentious point is whether Pasok's right to due process was violated by the Ombudsman's reliance on the COA report without providing him an opportunity to comment on it.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court dismissed Pasok's petition, affirming the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause. It held that the Ombudsman did not commit grave abuse of discretion and that Pasok was not deprived of due process, as he was given an opportunity to present his defense during the preliminary investigation. The Court upheld the Ombudsman's broad discretion in conducting investigations and relying on the COA report.
