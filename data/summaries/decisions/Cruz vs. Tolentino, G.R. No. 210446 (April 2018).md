## Legal Document Summary: Cruz vs. Tolentino, G.R. No. 210446

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of a case for Annulment of Sale & Title.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Angelica G. Cruz, Anna Marie Kudo, Albert G. Cruz, and Arturo G. Cruz (Heirs of Alfredo S. Cruz)
*   **Respondents:** Marylou Tolentino and the Office of the Register of Deeds of Mandaluyong City

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Two parcels of land originally owned by Alfredo S. Cruz, covered by TCT Nos. 461194 and 461195.
*   **SPA:** Alfredo executed an SPA in favor of his wife, Purificacion, to sell/mortgage the properties. Alfredo later died.
*   **Deeds of Absolute Sale:** Two Deeds of Absolute Sale exist. One from Alfredo to Tolentino (July 9, 1992, unnotarized). The other from Alfredo (represented by Purificacion) to Tolentino (December 1, 1992, notarized, citing SPA).
*   **Central Dispute:** Validity of the December 1, 1992 Deed of Absolute Sale in light of Alfredo's prior death and the limitations on Purificacion's authority under the SPA. Petitioners claim the SPA became ineffectual upon Alfredo's death and argue fraud.
*   **Civil Cases:**
    *   **MC00-1300 (Petitioners vs. Tolentino et al.):** Action for Annulment of Sale, Title, Damages & Injunction.
    *   **MC 99-843 (Tolentino vs. Purificacion):** Action for Registration of Deed of Sale, Mandamus and Damages, seeking to validate the sale of Purificacion's share of the property. The validity of the same Deed of Absolute Sale (December 1, 1992) is the subject of this case.
*   **Trial Court Ruling (RTC):** Dismissed MC00-1300 based on *litis pendentia* given MC 99-843. Also noted that the Court already issued a decision in MC 99-843 finding the Deed of Absolute Sale and SPA to be valid.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the dismissal based on *litis pendentia*, despite finding that the elements of res judicata were not strictly met.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Purificacion may be liable to Tolentino for the validity of the share sold in the deed.
*   Heirs are potentially liable for Alfredo's debts if the proceeds of the sale inured to their benefit.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Deed of Absolute Sale:** The central issue is whether the December 1, 1992 Deed of Absolute Sale is valid given Alfredo's death and the potential expiration or ineffectiveness of the SPA. This could impact the title to the properties.
*   **Litis Pendentia/Res Judicata:** The applicability of these doctrines is contentious. While the courts found litis pendentia, Petitioners argue that MC 99-843 lacked a genuine issue. However, the Supreme Court has upheld that the elements of res judicata are now present as the validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 1, 1992 has been decided with finality in Civil Case No. MC 99-843.
*   **Nature of Transaction:** Petitioners contend the Deed was actually a loan with usurious interest, not a sale.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Litis Pendentia:** *City of Makati v. Municipality (now City) of Taguig*, 578 Phil. 773, 783 (2008). Defines the elements required for litis pendentia to apply.
*   **Res Judicata:** *P.L. Uy Realty Corporation v. ALS Management and Development Corporation*, 698 Phil. 47, 59-60 (2012). Discusses the elements of res judicata, which may now apply.
*   **Special Power of Attorney (SPA):** General principles of agency and the effect of the principal's death on the agent's authority (Article 1919 of the Civil Code).

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The actual intent of the parties concerning both Deeds of Absolute Sale.**
*   **The interest rate if the court deems the Deed of Absolute Sale to be a Loan.**

**Concise Summary:**

The heirs of Alfredo Cruz are challenging the validity of a sale of land from their deceased father (represented by their mother, purportedly under an SPA) to Marylou Tolentino. The RTC dismissed the case due to *litis pendentia* arising from a prior case (MC 99-843) filed by Tolentino to validate the sale of the subject property. The CA affirmed this ruling. This Supreme Court decision affirms the CA ruling because the elements of res judicata, as a bar by prior judgment, are now present, as the Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 1, 1992 was already decreed to be valid and legal in Civil Case No. MC 99-843.
