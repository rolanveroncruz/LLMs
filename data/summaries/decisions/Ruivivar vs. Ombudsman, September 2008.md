## Legal Document Summary: Ruivivar v. Office of the Ombudsman and Dr. Bernardo (G.R. No. 165012)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Subject Matter:** Administrative liability for discourtesy in the course of official duties.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Ombudsman Decision:** Found Rachel Beatriz Ruivivar (Petitioner), then Chairperson of the LTO Accreditation Committee on Drug Testing, administratively liable for discourtesy in the course of official duties towards Dr. Connie Bernardo (Private Respondent) and imposed a penalty of reprimand.
*   **Grounds for Complaint:** Private Respondent alleged Petitioner shouted at her in an arrogant and insulting manner during a follow-up on her company's accreditation, supported by witness affidavits.
*   **Petitioner's Defense:** Denied the allegations, stating she merely directed Private Respondent to the appropriate LTO official.
*   **CA Decision:** Initially dismissed the petition for certiorari filed by Petitioner, ruling that Rule 43 was the proper remedy per *Fabian v. Desierto*, and that she had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Found administratively liable for discourtesy. The penalty is reprimand.
*   **Obligation to Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** The Petitioner needed to properly respond to the additional submission by the court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Ombudsman Decision:** The Supreme Court ultimately denied the petition, confirming the finality of the Ombudsman's decision.
*   **Precedent for Discourtesy:** The ruling reinforces the potential for administrative liability for discourtesy by public officials.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Fabian v. Desierto:** Key precedent regarding appeals from the Ombudsman. SC clarified that appeals from the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases should be taken to the CA under Rule 43, EXCEPT when the penalty imposed is final and unappealable according to Section 27 of RA 6770 and Section 7, Rule III of AO No. 7. In such cases, the proper remedy is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act):** Section 27 was partially invalidated by *Fabian v. Desierto* regarding the appeal route.
*   **Administrative Order No. 7 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman):** Section 7, Rule III, was similarly impacted by *Fabian v. Desierto*.
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Outlines the procedure for appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Addresses the procedure for filing a Petition for Certiorari.
*   **People v. Acot, 232 SCRA 406** A party cannot feign denial of due process where he had the opportunity to present his side.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process Argument:** Petitioner claimed denial of due process due to not initially receiving witness affidavits. This was addressed by the Ombudsman providing the affidavits and an opportunity to respond, which the petitioner did not fully utilize, weakening the due process argument.
*   **Mode of Review (Rule 43 vs Rule 65):**  The central issue was whether the CA had jurisdiction, since the remedy to assail the Ombudsman's decision should be a petition for review under Rule 43 as laid down in Fabian, and not a petition for certiorari.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The petitioner argued that the Ombudsman's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.

**Overall Assessment:**

While the CA initially erred in its assessment of the mode of review, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the Ombudsman's decision. The key takeaway is the importance of exhausting administrative remedies and fully utilizing opportunities to present one's case to avoid claims of due process violations. This case also clarifies the correct mode of appeal from Ombudsman decisions based on the nature of the penalty imposed.
