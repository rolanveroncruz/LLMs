Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Jose Concepcion, Jr. v. Commission on Elections (COMELEC)*, G.R. No. 178624, June 30, 2009.

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, Rules of Court, seeking to set aside COMELEC Resolutions dated April 2, 2007, and May 8, 2007. The petitioner, Jose Concepcion, Jr., challenged COMELEC's condition for accrediting NAMFREL (of which he was National Chairman): that he be removed as a member and chairman because he was the incumbent *Punong Barangay* of Barangay Forbes Park, Makati City.

**Key Provisions & Resolutions:**

*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 7798:** Prohibits *barangay* officials (Punong Barangay, *Kagawad*, Secretary, Treasurer, *Tanod*) from being appointed as members of the Board of Election Inspectors (BEIs), official watchers, or members of accredited citizens' arms. This resolution relied on Section 3 of Executive Order No. 94 (EO 94) which was related to a plebiscite and was issued by then President Corazon Aquino.

*   **COMELEC Resolution (April 2, 2007):** Conditionally granted NAMFREL's petition for accreditation as a citizen's arm, subject to the condition that Jose Concepcion, Jr., be removed from his position as National Chairman and member due to his position as *Punong Barangay*, citing COMELEC Resolution No. 7798.

*   **COMELEC Order (May 8, 2007):** Denied NAMFREL's request to re-examine COMELEC's interpretation of the April 2, 2007 Resolution.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   COMELEC acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing Resolution No. 7798, arguing it had no statutory basis because:
    *   EO No. 94 applied *only* to the February 2, 1987, plebiscite.
    *   EO No. 94 doesn't prohibit membership in citizens' arms.
    *   COMELEC's regulation exceeded the scope of the law, as the goal was to prevent interference by barangay officials as poll watchers.

*   Retroactive application of Resolution No. 7798 to NAMFREL's petition was improper, as NAMFREL's petition was filed before the resolution's effectivity.

*   Resolution No. 7798 is an invalid implementing regulation because it is not reasonable, bears no relation to the purpose of the law, and is contrary to laws and the Constitution.

*   Violation of petitioner's right to association and procedural due process, as he was not given an opportunity to be heard regarding Resolution No. 7798.

**Respondent's Arguments (OSG on behalf of COMELEC):**

*   Resolution No. 7798 was a valid exercise of COMELEC's quasi-legislative power to implement election laws; notice and hearing were not required. Citing Section 52(c) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). *Central Bank v. Cloribel* (44 SCRA 307 [1972]) was cited to buttress the point.

*   EO No. 94 applies beyond the 1987 plebiscite, reflecting its underlying spirit and intent.

*   Petitioner had a conflict of interest, given NAMFREL's right to appoint watchers.

*   COMELEC's broad power to administer elections under Section 2(1), Article IX(C) of the Constitution gives it necessary powers to achieve credible elections, citing *Pangandaman v. Comelec*, G.R. No. 134340, November 25, 1999, 319 SCRA 283.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Court *dismissed* the petition for *blatant misuse of Rule 65*.

*   The Court held that petitioner lacked personality/standing to challenge the April 2, 2007, Resolution because he was not a party to the COMELEC proceedings. NAMFREL, the direct party, did not question the resolution and had accepted accreditation. Citing *Tang v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 117204, February 11, 2000, 325 SCRA 394, 402-403, and *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit*, G.R. No. 144516, February 11, 2004, 422 SCRA 459.

*   The petition improperly converted a challenge to an adjudicatory resolution into a challenge to a regulation (Resolution No. 7798) via an original Rule 65 petition.  Petitioner should have used declaratory relief (Rule 63) or prohibition (Rule 65) in the RTC or challenged the adjudicatory order directly had he had the proper standing. Citing *Lozano, et al. vs. Nograles*, G.R. Nos. 187883/187910, June 16. 2009.

**Key Issues & Risks:**

*   **Standing:** The primary legal issue is the petitioner's lack of standing to bring the certiorari petition challenging the COMELEC resolution.

*   **Scope of EO No. 94:** The interpretation of EO No. 94 and whether its prohibition extends beyond the specific 1987 plebiscite. This directly impacts the validity of COMELEC Resolution 7798.

*   **COMELEC's Quasi-Legislative Power:** The extent of COMELEC's authority to issue regulations and whether notice and hearing are required.

*   **Procedural Issues:** The improper use of a Rule 65 petition to challenge a regulation indirectly, rather than using appropriate avenues like declaratory relief.

*   **Potential Abuse of Process:** The Court alluded to the possibility of abuse of process through manipulative reading of the Rules of Court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lasting applicability of EO No. 94 beyond the 1987 plebiscite.  The COMELEC and OSG argued for its broader application based on its spirit and intent, a point directly contested by the petitioner.
