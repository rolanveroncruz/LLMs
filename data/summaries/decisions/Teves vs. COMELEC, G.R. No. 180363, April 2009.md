Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Edgar Y. Teves v. Commission on Elections and Herminio G. Teves*, G.R. No. 180363, April 28, 2009 (604 Phil. 717)

**Issue:** Whether Edgar Y. Teves's prior conviction for violating Section 3(h) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) involves moral turpitude, thereby disqualifying him from holding public office under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code.

**Facts:**
*   Edgar Y. Teves (Petitioner) was convicted in *Teves v. Sandiganbayan* for violating Section 3(h) of R.A. 3019 for possessing a pecuniary interest in a cockpit (prohibited under Section 89(2) of the Local Government Code of 1991 (LGC)).
*   Herminio G. Teves (Respondent) filed a petition to disqualify Edgar from running for Representative based on this conviction, arguing it involved moral turpitude and carried perpetual disqualification.
*   The COMELEC First Division disqualified Edgar; the COMELEC En Banc denied his Motion for Reconsideration as moot because he lost the election.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversed the COMELEC rulings, and declared that Edgar Teves's conviction for violating Section 3(h) of R.A. 3019 *did not* involve moral turpitude.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Moral Turpitude Definition:** The Court reiterates the definition of moral turpitude as "everything which is done contrary to justice, modesty, or good morals; an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes his fellowmen, or to society in general." (Citing *Soriano v. Dizon*).
*   **Section 3(h) R.A. 3019 Analysis:** The Court recognizes two modes of violating Section 3(h): (1) intervening in one's official capacity in a matter where one has financial interest, or (2) holding a prohibited financial interest. Teves was convicted under the *second mode*.
*   **Conviction Mode Not Determinative:** The Court held that a conviction under the *second mode* (prohibited interest) *does not automatically* involve moral turpitude.  A determination of all surrounding circumstances of the violation of the statute must be considered.
*   **Crimes Mala in Se vs Mala Prohibita:** The Court distinguished crimes mala in se and mala prohibita, however, it stated that whether or not a crime involves moral turpitude is ultimately a question of fact and frequently depends on all the circumstances surrounding the violation of the statute.
*   **Lack of Intent:** Crucially, the Court found no evidence that Teves *used* his official capacity to gain the interest, nor that he *intentionally hid* the interest. The transfer of management to his wife occurred *before* the LGC prohibition took effect.  The Court emphasized that under the prior Local Government Code, mere possession of the interest was *not* prohibited. This mitigating factor contributed to the Sandiganbayan imposing only a fine. The downgrading of the penalty is recognition that the violation was not intentionally done contrary to justice, modesty, or good morals.
*   **Legality vs. Morality of Cockfighting:** The Court sidesteps the moral implications of cockfighting, stating the morality or wisdom in legalizing it is not a justiciable issue, citing *Magtajas v. Pryce Properties Corporation, Inc*. The Court stated that Congress has made the choice to permit cockfighting.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 3019, Section 3(h):**  The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Local Government Code of 1991, Section 89(2):** Prohibits local government officials from holding interests in cockpits.
*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 12:**  Disqualifications for candidates due to crimes involving moral turpitude.
*   **Teves v. Sandiganbayan:** The underlying conviction of Edgar Teves for violating R.A. 3019, Sec. 3(h).
*   **Soriano v. Dizon:** Defines moral turpitude.
*   **Dela Torre v. Commission on Elections:** Distinguishes *mala in se* from *mala prohibita* and the need to review facts and circumstances.
*   **IRRI v. NLRC:** Illustrates the need to consider the circumstances of the commission when determining whether or not a crime involves moral turpitude.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The inherent ambiguity in defining "moral turpitude" remains.  The Court relies on a general definition and applies a fact-specific analysis.
*   The concurrence by Justice Brion highlights this definitional challenge and attempts to provide a framework to the definition by employing "approaches" to the definition, but ultimately concluding that depravity remains the standard and that the application of three approaches is the safest way of determining moral turpitude.
*   The Court's decision hinges on the lack of intent and the timing of the violation relative to the LGC prohibition. This could be a contentious point if future cases present similar facts but with stronger evidence of intent or knowledge.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   This decision creates precedent that may make it more difficult to disqualify candidates based on R.A. 3019 violations *unless* there is clear evidence of intent, abuse of office, or concealment.
*   The reliance on the timing of the violation could be challenged in future cases if the facts are more ambiguous.
*   The Court's avoidance of the moral implications of cockfighting could be seen as a weakness in the reasoning.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The *Teves v. COMELEC* case provides a narrow interpretation of moral turpitude in the context of Section 3(h) R.A. 3019 violations. The ruling emphasizes that simply holding a prohibited interest is insufficient for disqualification; evidence of *mens rea* (intent), abuse of office, or deliberate concealment is required.  The decision hinges heavily on the specific facts of the case, particularly the lack of evidence of Teves using his office or intentionally concealing his interest. The key risk is that this precedent may weaken future attempts to disqualify candidates based on similar violations *absent* proof of deliberate malfeasance or intent.
