**Legal Document Summary: *Lopez v. Esquivel* G.R. No. 168734 & *Nordec v. Esquivel* G.R. No. 170621**

**Overview:**

Two consolidated petitions before the Supreme Court regarding a parcel of land (2.6950 hectares) in Antipolo, Rizal, originally part of a larger homestead granted to Hermogenes Lopez.  G.R. No. 168734 concerns a reconveyance action. G.R. No. 170621 concerns a petition to annul the decision in the reconveyance action due to lack of due process. The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals in the reconveyance action and *denied* the petition to annul judgment.

**G.R. No. 168734: Reconveyance Action (Lopez Heirs vs. Esquivel and Talens)**

*   **Key Issue:** Validity of a Quitclaim executed by Hermogenes Lopez in favor of Lauro Hizon regarding the 2.6950-hectare parcel, later sold by Hizon to Esquivel and Talens, and its effect on the Lopez heirs' title.

*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court held the Quitclaim *null and void*, rejecting the lower court's estoppel argument.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   While the Quitclaim was executed outside the prohibitive period of alienation under the Public Land Act (CA 141), it did *not* validly convey the property.
    *   Inclusion of the subject property in Hermogenes' homestead patent, approved by the Director of Lands, carries a presumption of regularity, casting doubt on the "mistake" claim.
    *   Homestead lands, if erroneously included in a patent, revert to the *State*, not a private claimant (Hizon).
    *   Hizon did not demonstrate possession, cultivation, or improvements on the land, as required for a homestead patent.

*   **Statutory References:** Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), Section 118 (prohibition on alienation), Sections 12, 13, & 17 (Homestead applicant policy).
*   **Laches/Statute of Limitations:** The Court also found Esquivel and Talens were barred by *laches* (unreasonable delay) for failing to assert their rights for 25-28 years after the Quitclaim and sale, including the Deeds of Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land.
*   **Estoppel:** The Court rejected the Court of Appeals' application of estoppel *in pais* against the Lopez heirs.
*   **Case Law:** *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 90380), *Cabuay, Jr. v. Lopez* (G.R. No. 123780), and *Lopez v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 127827) regarding validity of homestead grant deemed inapplicable as *law of the case*, as those cases did not involve the same parties or directly tackle the reconveyance action.

**G.R. No. 170621: Annulment of Judgment (Nordec Phil. and Malvar vs. Esquivel and Talens, et al.)**

*   **Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Nordec Phil. and Malvar's Petition for Annulment of Judgment of the RTC decision in Civil Case No. 96-4193 (reconveyance action) on the ground of prematurity.

*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court *affirmed* the dismissal.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   A petition for annulment of judgment is a remedy only against *final and executory* judgments. The RTC decision was still under review by the Supreme Court in G.R. No. 168734; it was not yet final.
    *   The purpose of annulment is to allow for a "renewal of litigation." This could not occur when there was still an active, ongoing litigation.
    *   Nordec Phil. and Malvar had not been parties to the reconveyance action, thus ordinary remedies like motions for new trial and appeal were unavailable.

*   **Grounds Alleged for Annulment:** Nordec alleged *extrinsic fraud* (deliberate failure to implead them despite knowledge of their interest, and conflict of interest of their counsel) and *lack of due process*.  However, since the action was premature, the Court did not decide whether such grounds existed.
*   **Rules of Procedure References:** Rules 37, 38, 41, and 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Validity of the underlying transactions to Nordec/Malvar:** While the case focused on the Quitclaim and reconveyance action, Nordec Phil. and Malvar's claim of ownership rested on purchases from the Lopez heirs *while the reconveyance action was ongoing*. The Court's decision in G.R. No. 168734 invalidating the Quitclaim significantly weakens Nordec/Malvar's claim.  However, that case only decided the Quitclaim was invalid, *not* specifically whether sale to Nordec was itself valid.  Further litigation between Nordec/Malvar and Lopez heirs seems likely.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud Claim:** While unaddressed by the Court due to the procedural issue, the allegations of deliberate non-joinder of parties (Nordec/Malvar) and counsel conflict of interest present a significant basis for future litigation should Nordec/Malvar attempt to re-litigate the property ownership.
*   **Discrepancy in Land Area**: discrepancy in claimed hectares of land need to be considered and resolved in order to determine exact land owner.
*   **Section 38 of Act No. 496:** The Lopez siblings argued that Esquivel and Talens could not have availed themselves of the recourse prescribed by Section 38 of Act No. 496, otherwise known as the Land Registration Act, in their action for reconveyance of the subject property. The legal document did not address this issue.
