**Case Summary: Spouses Padilla v. Velasco, G.R. No. 169956 (2009)**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's ruling in an *accion publiciana* case filed by the Velasco heirs (Respondents) against the Padilla spouses (Petitioners) concerning Lot No. 2161. The RTC ruled in favor of the Respondents, ordering the Petitioners to vacate, account for crop proceeds, and remove structures.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Nature of Action:** *Accion publiciana* - Recovery of the right to possess.
*   **Ownership Dispute:** Respondents claim ownership via deed of sale from original title holders (Sacluti Spouses) to their predecessor, Artemio Velasco, and subsequent possession. Petitioners claim ownership via deed of sale from the Rural Bank of Pagsanjan, which acquired the property (Lot 76-pt) via foreclosure from Valeriano Velasco.
*   **Factual Findings:** RTC & CA found that Petitioners occupied Lot 2161 (belonging to Artemio Velasco/Respondents), whereas the land sold by the bank was Lot 76-pt. Courts found respondents entitled to possession of Lot 2161 based on prior lawful possession. This determination of better possession hinges on RTC and CA's finding that respondents and their predecessors-in-interest had been in possession of the subject realty for a long time. The Court also found that the prior lawful possession by the respondents was adequately established.
*   **Collateral Attack:** Petitioners' argument that Lot 2161 and Lot 76-pt are the same is deemed a collateral attack on the title over the property registered in the name of Artemio Velasco, violating Sec. 48 of PD 1529.  The Court reiterates that a separate action is necessary to raise the issue of ownership.
*   **Prescription:** The SC found that the case was timely filed within the ten-year prescriptive period for *accion publiciana* under Article 555(4) of the Civil Code. The Court found that the petitioners dispossessed respondents of the property in October 1987 and that the Respondents filed the action with the RTC on October 14, 1991.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to vacate the property (Lot 2161), restore possession to Respondents, provide accounting for harvested crops, and remove constructed structures.
*   Petitioners bear the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification of the Land:** The crucial determination rested on whether Lot 2161 and Lot 76-pt are the same. The Petitioners failed to prove this at trial, and the Courts ruled that this amounted to a collateral attack on title. The failure to definitively link the two lots is a significant weakness in the Petitioners' case.
*   **Counsel Incompetency:** Petitioners argued for a new trial due to their counsel's illness and alleged failure to present crucial evidence. The Supreme Court rejected this argument citing *Palanca v. American Food Manufacturing Company* (1968) and *People v. Manzanilla* (1922), stating that counsel's mistakes or failures do not warrant a new trial unless the incompetence is so great that the client is prejudiced. The Court found that the evidence on record adequately established the Respondent's earlier rightful possession of the subject parcel of land and that the testimonial and documentary evidence sought to be adduced in a new trial would not adversely affect the findings of the Court.
*   **Estoppel:** The Court did not find that the respondents were estopped from denying the title of the bank and the Solomon spouses due to inaction over the course of time.
* **Laches:** The court also did not find that respondents were guilty of laches.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Article 555(4) of the Civil Code:** Defines the prescriptive period for real rights of possession.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 48:** Prohibits collateral attacks on certificates of title.
*   ***Refugia v. CA, 327 Phil. 982 (1996):*** Clarifies the jurisdiction of inferior courts to resolve ownership issues in possessory actions where possession hinges on ownership. It states that declarations made affecting ownership are to be regarded merely as provisional, hence, does not bar nor prejudice an action between the same parties involving title to the land.
*   ***Sps. Cruz v. Torres, 374 Phil. 529, 533 (1999):*** Defines *accion publiciana*.
*   ***Natalia Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 440 Phil. 1, 25 (2002):*** Further defines *accion publiciana*.
*   ***Cutanda v. Heirs of Cutanda, 390 Phil. 740, 751 (2000):*** The remedy of *accion publiciana* prescribes after the lapse of ten years.
*   ***Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation v. Gobonseng, Jr., G.R. No. 163562, July 21, 2006, 496 SCRA 305, 316:*** Lists the exceptions to the general rule that the findings of facts of the RTC and the CA are deemed conclusive and binding to this Court.
*   ***Palanca v. The American Food Manufacturing Company, 133 Phil. 872, 882 (1968); People v. Manzanilla, 43 Phil. 167, 169 (1922):*** Discusses the rule of counsel incompetency.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not a specific clause, the determination of whether Lot 2161 and Lot 76-pt are the same is highly contentious and represents the central point of disagreement. The lack of conclusive evidence linking the properties favored the Respondents.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA and RTC's decisions, finding that the Respondents had a better right of possession to Lot No. 2161 and that the Petitioners had not successfully challenged the registered title or proven their claim through the Rural Bank's sale.
