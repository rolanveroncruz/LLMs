## Legal Document Summary: *Tadeo v. People*, G.R. No. 129774

**Nature:** Appeal by certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision dismissing a petition for certiorari which sought to annul a trial court's order denying a demurrer to evidence in 8 cases for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (BP 22).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **BP 22 Violation:** Accusation stems from the issuance of 8 postdated checks by petitioner to settle rental arrears, which were dishonored due to insufficient funds ("DAIF").
*   **Demurrer to Evidence:** Petitioner filed a demurrer to evidence *without* leave of court, arguing insufficient evidence to prove all elements of the BP 22 offense. The trial court denied the demurrer.
*   **Certiorari:** Petitioner filed a petition for certiorari in the Court of Appeals challenging the denial of the demurrer, which was dismissed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To ensure sufficient funds to cover issued checks; liability for violation of BP 22.
*   **Complainant's Role:** Landlord, recipient of checks, and witness for the prosecution.
*   **Presumption of Knowledge:**  Under BP 22, a presumption arises that the drawer (petitioner) had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds upon receiving notice of dishonor.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction:**  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision. Failure to rebut the presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds leaves the petitioner vulnerable to conviction under BP 22.
*   **Loss of Right to Present Evidence:** By filing the demurrer to evidence without prior leave of court, the petitioner potentially loses the right to adduce evidence in his defense (Rule 119, Sec. 15, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (BP 22):** The core statute defining and penalizing the issuance of bouncing checks. Section 2 defines the offense, and Section 3 establishes the prima facie evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds.
*   **Rule 119, Sec. 15, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Addresses the consequence of filing a demurrer to evidence *without* leave of court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:**  Petitioner argued that the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence by not presenting a bank representative. However, the Court found the complainant's testimony sufficient to establish a prima facie case, triggering the presumption of knowledge.  The key contention revolves around whether the prosecution adequately proved all elements of BP 22 based solely on the complainant's testimony and the dishonored checks. The presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds is a crucial point.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. This case hinges on the application of BP 22, the presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds, and the procedural effect of filing a demurrer without leave of court. The case is remanded to the trial court for imposition of sentence. The primary risk for the petitioner is conviction for violating BP 22.
