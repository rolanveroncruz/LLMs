**Legal Document Summary: People v. Aspa, Jr., G.R. No. 229507**

This case concerns the appeal of Domingo Aspa, Jr.'s conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act), specifically the illegal sale of 7.8471 grams of marijuana.  Both the RTC and CA found Aspa guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on a buy-bust operation. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction with a modification to the imposed penalty.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **Facts:** Aspa was apprehended in a buy-bust operation selling marijuana to a poseur-buyer (PO1 Italin).  The prosecution presented evidence including marked buy-bust money, seized marijuana, and testimony from police officers involved.
*   **Defense:** Aspa claimed denial, stating that he was framed and the marijuana was given to him as payment for a loan by a person named Ernie Figuerres.
*   **RTC & CA Rulings:** Both courts found the prosecution's evidence credible and sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. They rejected Aspa's defense of denial. They affirmed the conviction of Life Imprisonment without eligibility of parole and to pay a fine of five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00) .
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. They held that all elements of illegal sale were proven: identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment.
    *   The phrase "without eligibility for parole" need not be appended because parole is extended only to those convicted of divisible penalties and, hence, must be deleted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Aspa:**  Obligated to serve a sentence of life imprisonment and pay a fine of P500,000 for violation of R.A. 9165.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  Aspa argued that the police failed to follow the procedure in Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165 because no representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ) was present during the inventory. The Supreme Court noted the absence but ruled it was not fatal because the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.
*   **Defense of Denial:** Aspa's defense of denial was deemed weak and unsubstantiated, failing to overcome the positive identification by the police officers. The Court emphasized that findings of trial courts are accorded respect when no glaring errors or speculative conclusions can be gathered from such findings.

**Ambiguities & Areas for Further Examination:**

*   The absence of a DOJ representative during the inventory. While the Court deemed it not fatal, the exact reasons for the non-compliance were not definitively established in the evidence. Defense counsel could have pressed more strongly on the operational deficiencies of the buy-bust team.
