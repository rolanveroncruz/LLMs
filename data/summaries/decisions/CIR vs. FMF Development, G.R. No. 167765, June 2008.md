**Case Summary: CIR v. FMF Development Corporation, G.R. No. 167765 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the CTA decision which cancelled the BIR's assessment notice for deficiency income and withholding taxes against FMF Development Corporation (FMF) for taxable year 1995.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 203 NIRC:** General 3-year prescriptive period for assessment of internal revenue taxes from the filing deadline or actual filing date, whichever is later.
*   **Section 222(b) NIRC:** Exception to the 3-year period; allows for a written agreement between the CIR and taxpayer to extend the assessment period.  Subsequent extensions also require written agreement before the prior extension expires.
*   **RMO No. 20-90:**  Implements Sections 203 and 222(b) of the NIRC, outlining specific procedures for executing valid waivers of the statute of limitations.  Non-compliance can lead to administrative action against revenue officials.

**Key Facts:**

*   FMF filed its 1995 income tax return in April 1996 and an amended return in May 1996.
*   BIR issued pre-assessment notices in October 1998.
*   FMF executed a waiver of the prescriptive period in February 1999, extending the assessment period to October 31, 1999.
*   The BIR issued amended pre-assessment notices and a formal assessment notice in October 1999.
*   FMF protested, claiming the waiver was invalid and prescription had set in.

**Court's Holding and Rationale:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the waiver was valid and whether the assessment was time-barred.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the CIR's petition, affirming the CA's decision. The assessment notice was issued beyond the 3-year prescriptive period because the waiver was invalid.

**Reasons for Invalidity:**

1.  **Non-Compliance with RMO No. 20-90:**
    *   Lack of proof that FMF received a copy of the BIR-accepted waiver.
    *   The waiver was signed by a Revenue District Officer (RDO) instead of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), despite the case involving an amount exceeding P1 million and the period to assess not being about to prescribe.
    *   Absence of the date of acceptance by the CIR on the waiver, making it impossible to verify if acceptance occurred before the original prescriptive period expired.
2. **Strict Construction:** The SC emphasized that waivers of the statute of limitations, being in derogation of the taxpayer's rights, must be strictly construed.
3.  **Equivocal Language:** The waiver did not specify a definite expiration date, making it unlimited in time.
4.  **Lack of Consent:** Absence of CIR's signature indicated lack of consent to the waiver.

**Liabilities:**

*   The BIR could not collect the deficiency taxes because the assessment was issued beyond the prescriptive period.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   The case highlights the risk to the BIR of assessments being nullified due to failure to strictly comply with RMO No. 20-90 regarding waivers.
*   The interpretation of "directory" vs. "mandatory" nature of the requirements of RMO No. 20-90 is a contentious point. The Court firmly established that these procedures are mandatory.
*   The case reinforces the protection afforded to taxpayers under the statute of limitations and the need for timely assessments.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Sections 203 and 222(b).
*   **Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 20-90:** Implementing guidelines for executing waivers of the statute of limitations.
*   **Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. CIR, G.R. No. 162852 (2004):** Held that waivers must be carefully and strictly construed and that the waiver of the statute of limitations is not a waiver of the right to invoke the defense of prescription.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*  The "directory vs. mandatory" argument for RMO 20-90
