**Legal Document Summary: *Segovia, Jr. et al. v. Atty. Rolando S. Javier* (A.C. No. 10244)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary case against Atty. Rolando S. Javier for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation of CPR:**  Atty. Javier found guilty of violating Canons 16 and 18, specifically Rules 16.03 and 18.03, for:
    *   Neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him (failure to file the case despite accepting fees).
    *   Failure to account for and return client funds.
    *   Failure to comply with directives from the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD), an arm of the Supreme Court.
*   **Client Relationship:**  Acceptance of money established an attorney-client relationship, imposing a fiduciary duty on Atty. Javier. *Nery v. Atty. Sampana, 742 Phil. 531, 536 (2014)*
*   **Past Offenses:** Noted that this is not the first time Atty. Javier was found liable for similar infractions involving misappropriation and withholding client funds. *Igual v. Javier, 324 Phil. 698, 709 (1996)*; *Adrimisin v. Javier, 532 Phil. 639 (2006).*

**Obligations Imposed on Atty. Javier:**

*   **Suspension:** Suspended from the practice of law for one (1) year, effective immediately upon receipt of the decision.
*   **Restitution:** Ordered to return P30,000.00 to the complainants, with legal interest:
    *   12% per annum from September 10, 2007 to June 30, 2013.
    *   6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until fully paid.
*   **Proof of Restitution:** Must submit proof of restitution to the Court within ten (10) days from payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Demonstrated through the disciplinary action of suspension.
*   **Civil Liability:** Explicitly ordered to restitute funds with interest. *Pitcher v. Atty. Gagate, 719 Phil. 82, 94 (2013)*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Amount:** The complaint alleges P57,000.00 collected, but the Court only recognized P30,000.00 due to lack of supporting evidence. Could be a potential issue if complainants pursue further action for the remaining amount.
*   **Interest Calculation:** Dates and rates clearly defined, but proper accounting and documentation of payments will be crucial to avoid future disputes regarding the final amount owed.

**Overall Assessment:**

The document reflects a serious breach of professional ethics by Atty. Javier. The Courtâ€™s decision is well-supported by evidence and precedent. The key issues are Atty. Javier's failure to provide legal services despite receiving fees, his failure to account for or return the money, and his disregard for the disciplinary process. The order for restitution is clear, and the consequences of failing to comply are severe.
