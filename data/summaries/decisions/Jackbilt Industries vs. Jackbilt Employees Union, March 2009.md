Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, focusing on key aspects for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Jackbilt Industries, Inc. v. Jackbilt Employees Workers Union-NAFLU-KMU*, G.R. Nos. 171618-19, March 13, 2009 (600 Phil. 336).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision regarding illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, and the legality of a strike.

**Facts:**

*   Jackbilt Industries temporarily shut down operations due to economic difficulties in 1997.
*   The Union protested, alleging anti-union motivation and a shutdown to avoid collective bargaining.
*   The Union went on strike on March 9, 1998, obstructing entry/exit to the facility.
*   Jackbilt obtained a TRO from the NLRC (April 14, 1998) to cease obstruction.
*   The NLRC found the Union violated the TRO, and issued a preliminary injunction on July 17, 1998.
*   Jackbilt dismissed Union officers/members for illegal acts during the strike, citing obstruction of ingress/egress.
*   The Union filed complaints for illegal lockout, runaway shop, damages, unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, and refusal to bargain.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Legality of the Strike:** The central issue is whether the employer *must* file a petition to declare a strike illegal before validly terminating employees who committed illegal acts during the strike.
*   **Article 264(a)(3) & (e) of the Labor Code:** Employer's right to terminate employees for illegal acts during a strike, and prohibition of obstruction of ingress/egress during picketing.
*   **Article 263 of the Labor Code:** Requirements for a valid strike, including notice and voting procedures.  Potentially at issue is whether the Union complied with these procedural requirements.
*   **NLRC Injunction (July 17, 1998):** Critical. The NLRC finding that the Union obstructed access to the facility is a key point.
*   **Conclusiveness of Judgment (Rule 39, Section 47(c), Rules of Court):**  The Supreme Court relies heavily on this principle, stating that the NLRC's prior finding of obstruction is binding.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice:** The CA found Jackbilt guilty of ULP, linking the shutdown to anti-union sentiments.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals, finding the dismissals were **legal**.
*   A separate petition to declare the strike illegal was not a *sine qua non* because the NLRC had already found that the Union committed illegal acts (obstruction) during the strike.
*   The principle of conclusiveness of judgment applies.
*   The SC implicitly found the NLRC injunction of July 17, 1998 to be adequate support to take action in relation to the terminated employees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The original Labor Arbiter and NLRC decisions imposed backwages and separation pay obligations on Jackbilt.
*   The Supreme Court's reversal removes these liabilities.
*   The Union has the obligation to comply with the Labor Code regarding strike procedures and the prohibition against obstruction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Requirements for Strike:** The document states that the employer asserted that the union failed to meet strike requirements under Article 263. The Supreme Court does not explicitly rule on whether the union failed to comply with Article 263, focusing on obstruction instead.
*   **"Anti-Union Sentiment":** The CA's finding of anti-union motivation suggests a potential for future ULP claims, although the Supreme Court decision weakens this argument considerably. The CA held most affected employees were union members, however the Supreme Court seems to refute this claim and sides with the NLRC's earlier findings.
*   **Interpretation of "May" in Article 264:** The court notes that Article 264 uses "may" regarding termination of employees involved in illegal strikes, implying employer discretion. The Court's reference to *Pilipino Telephone Corporation v. Pilipino Telephone Corporation Employees Association* strengthens Jackbilt's position that it had the option, not the obligation, to terminate.
