## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Madrelejos y Quililan*, G.R. No. 225328

This is a Supreme Court decision reviewing the conviction of Al Madrelejos for robbery with homicide, initially found guilty by the RTC and subsequently modified to attempted robbery with homicide by the CA. The Supreme Court ultimately reverses the CA's decision and reinstates the RTCâ€™s conviction with modifications to the damage awards.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Accused-appellant was charged with robbery with homicide under the Revised Penal Code. The information alleges conspiracy with a John Doe.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Accused-appellant and an accomplice announced a hold-up in a jeepney. The accomplice attempted to take the belongings of passengers. The victim, Jovel Federeso Jacaban, resisted, and accused-appellant shot him, resulting in his death. Other passengers' belongings were taken.
*   **Defense's Version:** Accused-appellant admits being in the jeepney but claims he shot the victim accidentally during a struggle for a gun with an "enemy." He denies intent to rob.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found accused-appellant guilty of robbery with homicide and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, plus civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Modified the RTC decision, finding accused-appellant guilty of attempted robbery with homicide. The CA reasoned that the prosecution failed to prove consummated asportation of Jovel's bag. The CA sentenced the accused to an indeterminate penalty of 12 years, 5 months, and 11 days to 18 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*, deleted the exemplary damages and increased the civil indemnity award.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court held that all the elements of robbery with homicide were present. The Court emphasized that although it was not clear from the records that the robbers were able to take Jovel's bag, it was established that the belongings of the other passengers were taken. Following *People v. Ebet* 649 Phil. 181 (2010), it is immaterial that the victim of homicide is other than the victim of robbery, as long as homicide occurs by reason of the robbery or on the occasion thereof.
*   Cited *People v. Obedo*, 451 Phil. 529, 538 (2003) for elements of robbery with homicide.
*   Cites jurisprudence to establish elements of robbery with homicide, particularly that the intent to rob need only precede the homicide. The homicide may occur before, during, or after the robbery.
*   Relies on witness testimony, specifically TSNs from August 10, 2010, and March 1, 2011, to establish the asportation of goods from other passengers.
*   Adjusted the damage awards according to the guidelines in *People v. Jugueta*, G.R. No. 202125, April 5, 2016, including civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant found guilty as principal in the crime of robbery with homicide.
*   Obligation to pay damages to the heirs of Jovel Federeso Jacaban: P75,000 as civil indemnity; P75,000 as moral damages; P75,000 as exemplary damages; and P50,000 as temperate damages, all with 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision.
*   Sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for accused-appellant.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The defense consistently argues accidental shooting. Credibility of witnesses and circumstantial evidence are critical.
*   **"On the occasion of the robbery":** The exact temporal and causal connection between the robbery and homicide is crucial. The Court relies on this connection, even though the victim of the homicide was not necessarily the victim of a completed robbery.
* **Re-evaluation based on similar cases:** There are several simlar cases with simlar outcomes.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (Robbery with Homicide, Art. 294).
