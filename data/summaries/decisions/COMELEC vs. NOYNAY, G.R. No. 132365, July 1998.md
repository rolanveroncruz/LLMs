## Legal Document Summary: COMELEC vs. Noynay

**Case:** *Commission on Elections vs. Hon. Tomas B. Noynay, et al.* G.R. No. 132365, July 9, 1998 (354 Phil. 262)

**Issue:** Jurisdiction over election offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six years, specifically violations of Section 261(i) of the Omnibus Election Code.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) retain exclusive original jurisdiction over election offenses, even those punishable by imprisonment of six years or less, despite the amendment to Section 32 of B.P. Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act) by R.A. No. 7691.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Section 268 of the Omnibus Election Code:** Explicitly grants RTCs exclusive original jurisdiction over *all* criminal actions for violations of the Election Code, except for failure to register or vote.
*   **Section 261(i) of the Omnibus Election Code:** Defines the prohibited act of intervention of public officers and employees in an election campaign or partisan political activity.
*   **Section 32 of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended by R.A. No. 7691:** Expands the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTCs), Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs), and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTCs) to include offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six years.
*   **Court's Rationale:**
    *   R.A. No. 7691 is a general law amending the Judiciary Reorganization Act, not a special law on jurisdiction.
    *   The opening sentence of Section 32 of B.P. Blg. 129, as amended, *excepts* cases falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of RTCs or the Sandiganbayan.
    *   Section 268 of the Omnibus Election Code is a *special law* vesting exclusive jurisdiction over election offenses to the RTCs and falls within the exception under Sec. 32 of BP 129.
    *   *Morales v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 126623, 1997) is cited as precedent, affirming that general jurisdictional provisions do not override specific grants of jurisdiction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent Judge Noynay:** Was ordered to resume hearing the cases and admonished for failing to properly interpret the jurisdictional statutes. Found to be in violation of Canons 4 and 18 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics and Rule 3.01, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   **Atty. Jose P. Balbuena (COMELEC Counsel):** Admonished for misquoting and misrepresenting case law. In violation of Rule 10.02 of Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The interaction between general jurisdictional amendments (like R.A. No. 7691) and specific jurisdictional grants in other statutes may continue to cause confusion.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7691:** Amends B.P. Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980)
*   **B.P. Blg. 129:** Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980
*   **Omnibus Election Code:** Sections 261(i), 264, 268
*   ***Morales v. Court of Appeals***: G.R. No. 126623, December 12, 1997 (Precedent on jurisdictional exceptions)
*   ***Alberto Naldoza v. Judge Juan Lavilles, Jr.***: A.M. No. MTJ-94-1009, March 5, 1996 (While cited, information about this case presented by COMELEC counsel was inaccurate)

**Concise Summary:**

The COMELEC successfully challenged an RTC judge's order to transfer election offense cases to the MTC based on an incorrect interpretation of R.A. No. 7691. The Supreme Court reaffirmed that Section 268 of the Omnibus Election Code specifically grants RTCs exclusive jurisdiction over election offenses, overriding the general expansion of MTC jurisdiction under R.A. No. 7691.
