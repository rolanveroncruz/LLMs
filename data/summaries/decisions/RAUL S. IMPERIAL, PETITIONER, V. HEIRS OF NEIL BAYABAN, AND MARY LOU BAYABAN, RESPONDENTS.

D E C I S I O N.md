**Case Summary: Imperial v. Heirs of Bayaban, G.R. No. 197626 (October 3, 2018)**

**Key Issue:**  Vicarious liability of an employer for the quasi-delict of an employee under Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code.  Also, admissibility of unauthenticated original receipts as proof of actual damages.

**Facts:** Petitioner Imperial's employee, Laraga, driving Imperial's van, negligently collided with a tricycle causing injuries to the Bayaban Spouses.  The RTC and CA held Imperial solidarily liable with Laraga.  Neil Bayaban died during the pendency of the case and was substituted by his heirs.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, with modification reinstating the award for temperate damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Establishes liability for quasi-delicts (negligence causing damage).
*   **Article 2180, Civil Code:** Imposes vicarious liability on employers for damages caused by employees acting within the scope of their assigned tasks. The burden of proving that the employee was acting within the scope of his or her assigned tasks rests with the plaintiff. When the plaintiff has discharged this burden, the presumption that the employer was negligent arises and the employer must put forward evidence showing that he or she had exercised the due diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of the employee.
*   **Scope of Assigned Tasks:**  Determined by whether the employee's act was in furtherance of the employer's interests (citing *Filamer Christian Institute v. Court of Appeals*). The Court found that since Laraga was driving in Antipolo, where the Petitioner alleged his greenhouse and garden were located and where he loaned the van for maintenance, the logical conclusion is that Laraga was driving the van in connection with the upkeep of petitioner's Antipolo greenhouse and garden. Laraga was driving the van in furtherance of the interests of petitioner at the time of the accident.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Imperial:**  Solidarily liable with Laraga for actual damages (medical expenses), temperate damages (loss of earning capacity), moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Imperial failed to overcome the presumption of negligence in the selection and supervision of Laraga.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Employment Dispute:**  The key factual issue revolves around whether Laraga was acting within the scope of his employment. Imperial argued that the accident occurred on Laraga's day off and that the van was in the custody of another person, but provided no supporting evidence.
*   **Proof of Actual Damages:**  Imperial challenged the admissibility of the original receipts for medical expenses, arguing that they were not authenticated. The Court held that the testimony of Mary Lou Bayaban as to the circumstances of the accident and the expenses she and Neil incurred as a result of it, to whom the receipts were issued, constituted sufficient authentication under Rule 132, Section 20 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Temperate vs. Actual Damages:** The Court clarified that temperate damages for loss of earning capacity are distinct from actual damages for medical expenses, allowing for recovery of both (citing *Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. v. Paras*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 2176, 2180, 2224, 2225
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 130, sec. 3, Rule 132, secs. 19, 20, 23
*   *Cangco v. Manila Railroad Co.*, 38 Phil. 768 (1918): Explanation of vicarious liability.
*   *Filamer Christian Institute v. Court of Appeals*, 287 Phil. 704 (1992): Definition of "scope of employment."
*   *Castilex Industrial Corporation v. Vasquez, Jr.*, 378 Phil. 1009 (1999):  Burden of proof to establish scope of employment lies with plaintiff.
*   *Pleyto v. Lomboy*, 476 Phil. 373 (2004): Standard of care for overtaking vehicles.
*   *Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. v. Paras*, 686 Phil. 736 (2012): Allows concurrent recovery of actual and temperate damages for distinct pecuniary losses.
*   *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013): Legal interest from finality of decision.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "scope of employment" is fact-specific and subject to interpretation. Here, the Court construed it broadly, finding that Laraga was furthering Imperial's interests despite it being his alleged day off.

**Potential Arguments for Imperial (Hypothetical Based on Loss):**

*   **More Rigorous Proof of Scope:** Argue that the respondents' evidence that Laraga was acting within the scope of his assigned tasks was merely based on the petitioner's allegation that his greenhouse and garden was located where the accident happened.
*   **Mitigation of Damages:** Argue that respondents failed to mitigate their damages, and that the medical expenses were unreasonable or unnecessary.

This case highlights the importance of employers exercising due diligence in the selection and supervision of their employees and underscores the evidentiary burdens in establishing vicarious liability for quasi-delicts. It also provides a framework for authenticating private documents and awarding damages.
