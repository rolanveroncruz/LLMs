## Legal Document Summary: *Bitanga v. Pyramid Construction Engineering Corporation* G.R. No. 173526

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's partial summary judgment.

**Key Issue:** Whether summary judgment was proper despite purported genuine issues of fact, and whether the guarantor, Benjamin Bitanga, can avail himself of the benefit of excussion.

**Facts:**

*   Pyramid Construction (Respondent) sued Macrogen Realty (represented by Benjamin Bitanga as President) for unpaid construction billings.
*   They entered into a Compromise Agreement approved by CIAC, obligating Macrogen to pay P6,000,000.00.
*   Benjamin Bitanga (Petitioner) executed a Contract of Guaranty for Macrogen's obligations.
*   Macrogen defaulted; CIAC issued a writ of execution, but the sheriff found minimal assets.
*   Pyramid demanded payment from Bitanga as guarantor.
*   RTC granted summary judgment against Bitanga and his wife, Marilyn, holding them solidarily liable.
*   CA reversed as to Marilyn, finding she was not party to the contract, but affirmed against Benjamin Bitanga.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** Macrogen's obligation to pay P6,000,000.00.
*   **Contract of Guaranty:** Bitanga's irrevocable and unconditional guaranty of Macrogen's payment.
*   **Article 2058, Civil Code:** Guarantor not compelled to pay unless creditor has exhausted debtor's property. (Benefit of Excussion)
*   **Article 2060, Civil Code:** Conditions for invoking excussion: set it up against creditor upon demand, point out debtor's available property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Benjamin Bitanga:** Held liable as guarantor.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Benefit of Excussion:** Bitanga failed to point out Macrogen's assets despite demand, precluding this defense.
*   **Liability for P6,000,000.00:** Affirmed liability under the Contract of Guaranty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Service of Demand Letter:** Bitanga argued improper service because letter was received at his office by someone he claims wasn't an employee. Court rejected this, citing Rules of Court on service and Bitanga's failure to adequately rebut the presumption of proper service.
*   **Benefit of Excussion:** Bitanga argued he was entitled to excussion because Macrogen had sufficient assets. Court rejected this, finding he failed to comply with Article 2060 and that evidence (Sheriff's return) suggested exhausting Macrogen's assets would be futile (Article 2059(5)).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 35, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Governs summary judgment.
*   **Article 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2062 of the Civil Code:** Relates to Guaranty.
*   **Section 6, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court:** Governs personal service.
*   ***Equitable PCI Bank v. Ong***: Defines conditions for summary judgment.
*   ***Luzon Steel Corporation v. Sia***: Relates to Guaranty
*   ***Ramos v. Court of Appeals***: Declares that a contract cannot be enforced against one who is not a party to it.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the summary judgment, finding no genuine issue of material fact. Bitanga lost the benefit of excussion due to his failure to point out Macrogen's assets and the evidence suggesting such excussion would be fruitless.
