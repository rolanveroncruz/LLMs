## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 2008-12-SC and A.M. NO. P-08-2510

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases regarding improper solicitation and unauthorized use of the Supreme Court letterhead.

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Office of the Court Administrator (OCA)
*   **Respondents:** Rolando H. Hernandez (Executive Assistant I, Legal Office, OCA) and Sheela R. Nobleza (Court Stenographer, Metropolitan Trial Court)

**Key Provisions and Findings of Fact:**

*   **Solicitation:** Hernandez and Nobleza solicited money from bonding companies accredited by the Court, ostensibly for a stenographers' convention (COSTRAPHIL). Only six companies gave an amount of P1,000.00-P2,000.00.
*   **Unauthorized Letterhead:** Respondents used an improvised Supreme Court letterhead (Hernandez) and the Metropolitan Trial Court Stenographers Association (MeTCSA), Manila Chapter letterhead (Nobleza) without authorization.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found that respondents conspired in the solicitation, despite their attempt to deflect blame. Hernandez helped introduce Nobleza to the companies, and Nobleza collected the proceeds.
*   **Misappropriation:** Nobleza admitted she did not attend the convention and used the solicited funds for personal expenses.
*   **Lack of Remorse/Understanding:** Nobleza's defense that solicitation is permissible without pending cases before the court, and Hernandez's claim of simply wanting to help, were deemed unacceptable.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Violation of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (Canon I, Section 2; Canon III, Section 2(e)). Prohibits soliciting or accepting gifts that might influence official actions.
*   OCA Circular No. 4-91. Strictly prohibits all personnel of the lower courts under the Administrative supervision of the Office of the Court Administrator from making any form of solicitation for contributions.
*   Duty to maintain public trust and integrity in the judiciary.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of improper solicitation, serious dishonesty and gross misconduct.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in government service.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Directly cited.
*   **OCA Circular No. 4-91:** Cited re prohibition of solicitation.
*   **Villaros v. Orpiano, 459 Phil. 1 (2003):** Emphasizes the heavy responsibility on court employees.
*   **De Leon-Dela Cruz v. Recacho, A.M. No. P-06-2122, July 17, 2007, 527 SCRA 622:** Reiterates the Court's intolerance of misconduct.
*   **REVISED PENAL CODE, Art. 8:** Referenced for the definition of conspiracy, although the "conspiracy" should not be given its technical meaning in criminal law.
*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 159556, May 26, 2005, 459 SCRA 236:** Referencing conspiracy, it is sufficient that the two respondents by their own respective acts have participated in the realization of the fraudulent and unlawful object and without such collusion the objective could not have been accomplished.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Section 52(A)(11) and Section 58(a) cited regarding penalties for improper solicitation.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Conspiracy" Standard:** The Court acknowledges that the level of proof for conspiracy differs in administrative proceedings compared to criminal law. While this facilitates a finding of liability based on a lower evidentiary threshold, it could be argued that it lowers the bar for a serious accusation.
*   **Severity of Penalty:** The penalty of dismissal and perpetual disqualification is harsh.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Respondents plead for consideration, Hernandez citing long service, advanced age, and remorse, while Nobleza cited her misunderstanding of the solicitation rules. The Court did not find these circumstances persuasive.

**Conclusion:**

This case establishes a zero-tolerance policy against improper solicitation by court personnel. The decision underscores the high ethical standards required of those involved in the administration of justice and imposes a severe penalty for breaches of conduct, even with potential mitigating circumstances. This case can be used as a precedent in similar cases and underscores the importance of due diligence.
