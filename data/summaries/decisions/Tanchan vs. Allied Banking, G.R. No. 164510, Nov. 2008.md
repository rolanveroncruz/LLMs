**Case Summary: *Spouses Santiago and Rufina Tanchan vs. Allied Banking Corporation***

**Citation:** 592 Phil. 252 (G.R. No. 164510, November 25, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Whether the writ of preliminary attachment was validly issued against the properties of the Tanchans, as sureties, and whether the respondent can claim for deficiency judgment on its seventh and eighth causes of action, not having alleged in its complaint that said loans were secured by a real estate mortgage and after the foreclosure there was a deficiency as in fact in its complaint, the respondent sought full recovery of the promissory notes subject of its seventh and eighth cause of action?

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Promissory Notes:** Cebu Foremost Construction, Inc. (Foremost) executed several USD and PHP promissory notes to Allied Banking Corporation (Allied).
*   **Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreements (CG/CSA):** Spouses Santiago and Rufina Tanchan (Petitioners), and Spouses Henry and Julie Ann Tanchan executed CG/CSAs, limiting their liability to Php150,000,000.00. Santiago acted as attorney-in-fact for Rufina.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** The notes were secured by a real estate mortgage over properties in Cebu City.
*   **Default and Demand:** Foremost defaulted. Allied demanded payment from Foremost and the sureties.
*   **Extra-judicial Foreclosure:** Allied foreclosed the real estate mortgage, bidding Php37,745,283.67 which was less than the outstanding amount due.
*   **Collection Suit:** Allied filed a collection suit against Foremost, Spouses Tanchan, and Petitioners, seeking the full amount of the promissory notes.
*   **Writ of Preliminary Attachment:** Allied obtained a writ of preliminary attachment against the properties of all defendants, alleging fraud.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC ruled in favor of Allied, ordering Foremost et al. to pay the outstanding amounts solidarily, subject to the Php150,000,000.00 limit for the sureties. The RTC upheld the writ of preliminary attachment.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Foremost:** Primary obligation to pay the principal loan amounts, interest, and penalties under the promissory notes.
*   **Spouses Tanchan and Petitioners:** Secondary obligation as sureties under the CG/CSAs, limited to Php150,000,000.00. Liability is solidary with Foremost, subject to the aforementioned limit.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Rufina Tanchan's Surety Obligation:** Rufina, through Santiago as attorney-in-fact, is bound by the surety agreement. The scope of the Special Power of Attorney granting Santiago the power to "contract debts and obligations...which may involve, affect or create a liability on the Property" is broad enough to encompass surety agreements (Exhibit N). The key argument against Rufina is whether the SPA authorized Santiago to guarantee loans of *third parties* (Foremost), as opposed to only borrowing *for* the family.
*   **Fraud Allegation and Writ of Preliminary Attachment:** The main risk lies in the wrongful issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment against the Petitioners' property. According to *Allied Banking Corporation v. South Pacific Sugar Corporation* (G.R. No. 163692, February 4, 2008) and *Ng Wee v. Tankiansee* (G.R. No. 171124, February 13, 2008), a writ of preliminary attachment cannot be based on mere general allegations of fraud. There must be specific, factual circumstances showing fraud *at the time of contracting the debt,* demonstrating a pre-conceived plan not to pay. The allegation that the Defendants were disposing/concealing their properties with intent to defraud the Plaintiff is not supported by any evidence in the record.
*   **Claim for Deficiency Judgment:** The complaint must explicitly state that what is sought is the recovery of the deficiency (*Suico Rattan & Buri Interiors, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 138145, June 15, 2006). There is an argument that the intent of the Allied to recover the amount due is borne out of the facts.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Petition for Review to Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Provisional Remedy of Attachment. *Allied Banking Corporation v. South Pacific Sugar Corporation* (G.R. No. 163692, February 4, 2008) highlights the need for specific allegations of fraud for attachment. *Ng Wee v. Tankiansee* (G.R. No. 171124, February 13, 2008) discusses the standard for issuing attachment against corporate officers.
*   **Civil Code Provisions on Suretyship:** Relevant for understanding the nature and extent of the surety's obligation.
*   **Bank of America, NT & SA v. American Realty Corporation,** G.R. No. 133876, December 29, 1999, 321 SCRA 659. The mortgagee has a single cause of action against the mortgagee-debtor which is to recover the debt.
*   **Suico Rattan & Buri Interiors, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,** G.R. No. 138145, June 15, 2006, 490 SCRA 560. Highlights the requirement of a Complaint to explicitly state that what is sought is the recovery of the deficiency.
*   **PCI Leasing & Finance, Inc. v. Dai,** G.R. No. 148980, September 21, 2007, 533 SCRA 611. In the pretrial, the claim must be raised as an issue.
*   **Rule 131 of the Rules of Court:** Each party must prove his own affirmative allegations. Written contracts such as the documents executed by the parties in the present case, are presumed to have been entered into for a sufficient consideration.

**Ambiguities:**

*   Whether Allied's Complaint adequately alleged a deficiency after the foreclosure sale (despite seeking to collect the original amounts due in the absence of specific evidence).
*   The extent of Santiago Tanchan's authority to bind his wife Rufina, under the special power of attorney, specifically whether it extends to guaranteeing loans of third parties.

**Conclusion:**

The strongest argument for the Tanchans is the wrongful issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment. The facts don't reveal the specific, articulated fraudulent practices Allied alleged. Also, Alliedâ€™s actions create a risk of double recovery. The fact that the complaint sought to recover Php7,582,945.85 for Promissory Note No. 0051-97-03688 despite its face value being higher suggest the intent to claim a deficiency.
