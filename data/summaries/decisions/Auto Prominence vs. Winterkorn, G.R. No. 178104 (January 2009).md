**Case Summary: Auto Prominence Corporation vs. Winterkorn et al.**

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Citation:** G.R. No. 178104, January 27, 2009 (597 Phil. 47)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Auto Prominence Corporation (APC) and Proton Pilipinas Corporation (PPC) (Philippine corporations)
*   **Respondents:** Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn et al. (Officers of Audi AG, a German corporation)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the Secretary of Justice's dismissal of a criminal complaint for estafa through falsification of public documents against the Audi AG officers.

**Background:**

PPC entered into agreements (ALTAPS Agreement, License Fee Agreement, Sole Distributorship Contract) with Audi AG for the assembly and distribution of "Audi" vehicles in the Philippines, as per the Philippine Motor Vehicle Development Program (MVDP). PPC/APC claimed Audi AG failed to fulfill its obligations, including establishing a full assembly operation and including the Philippines in its ASEAN Assembly Strategy. They filed a criminal complaint against the Audi AG officers for falsification of public documents (Art. 171, par. 4, in relation to Art. 172, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Alleged Crime:** Estafa through falsification of public documents. The core allegation is that Audi AG misrepresented its intention to fulfill its contractual obligations under the agreements, thereby inducing PPC/APC to invest substantial amounts.
*   **Probable Cause:** The central issue is whether there was probable cause to indict the Audi AG officers. The City Prosecutor initially found probable cause, but the Chief State Prosecutor (DOJ) reversed this, finding no criminal culpability. This decision was upheld by the Secretary of Justice and the Court of Appeals.
*   **Signatories to Agreements:** The respondents were not signatories to the key agreements.
*   **Specific Participation:** The complaint lacked specificity regarding the individual actions of the respondents that constituted the alleged fraud and falsification.
*   **Venue:** Initial challenges were made regarding the proper venue for the preliminary investigation, but these are ultimately not central to the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Mootness:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ultimately dismissed the criminal case (Criminal Case No. 4824-A), finding no basis for the charges. This led the Supreme Court to declare the Petition moot because any ruling on the existence of probable cause by the DOJ Secretary would be rendered irrelevant by the lower court's decision. The trial court reasoned that the Audi AG officers did not participate in the execution or implementation of the agreements. The Court considered the accused were never in Alaminos City, Pangasinan.

*   **People v. Court of Appeals, 361 Phil. 401, 410-411 (1999): **The court may deny or grant a motion to withdraw an information.
*   **Royal Cargo Corp. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, 465 Phil. 719, 725 (2004): **Where a declaration on an issue would have no practical use or value, this Court will refrain from expressing its opinion in a case where no practical relief may be granted in view of a supervening event.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Direct Involvement:** The absence of the respondents' signatures on the agreements and the lack of specific evidence linking their individual actions to the alleged misrepresentations weaken the estafa claim.
*   **Mootness Doctrine:** The RTC's dismissal of the criminal case rendered the Supreme Court's review of the DOJ's probable cause determination moot, precluding a ruling on the merits of the petition.
*   **Pending Motion for Reconsideration:** The Supreme Court acknowledged that PPC/APC's Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC's dismissal order was still pending, further emphasizing its decision not to preempt the RTC's evaluation of the case.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied the petition due to mootness, stemming from the RTC's dismissal of the criminal case. This decision highlights the importance of establishing a direct link between the actions of individual corporate officers and the alleged fraudulent acts, as well as the jurisdictional priority of the trial court once an information has been filed. The fate of PPC/APC rests on the outcome of their Motion for Reconsideration before the RTC.
