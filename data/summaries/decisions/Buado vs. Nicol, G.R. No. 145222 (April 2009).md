## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Buado v. CA and Nicol*, G.R. No. 145222

**Case Summary:** This case involves a dispute over the execution of a judgment against Erlinda Nicol for damages arising from slander. The petitioners, Spouses Buado, sought to execute the judgment against the conjugal property of Erlinda Nicol and her husband, Romulo Nicol (respondent). Romulo Nicol filed a separate action to annul the certificate of sale, claiming the levy on his conjugal property was improper. The core issue is whether Romulo Nicol can file a separate action to protect the conjugal property, challenging the execution of the judgment against his wife.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Judgment Execution:** The case centers around the execution of a judgment obtained by Spouses Buado against Erlinda Nicol for P40,000 (moral damages, attorney's fees, exemplary damages, and costs).
*   **Writ of Execution:** A writ of execution was issued against Erlinda Nicol's assets, and when personal property was insufficient, the Deputy Sheriff levied on real property (TCT No. T-125322), conjugal in nature with her husband.
*   **Third-Party Claim:** Arnulfo Fulo filed a third-party claim, which led to Spouses Buado posting a sheriff's indemnity bond. This event happened before the sale of the property.
*   **Auction Sale:** Spouses Buado were the highest bidder at the auction sale.
*   **Separate Action by Husband:** Romulo Nicol, the husband, filed a separate action for annulment of the certificate of sale and damages, claiming improper levy on conjugal property.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability of Conjugal Property:** The central question is whether the conjugal property is liable for the wife's personal debt (slander). The court emphasizes that under Article 122 of the Family Code, personal debts of a spouse are NOT chargeable to the conjugal partnership unless they benefited the family.
*   **Risk to Petitioners (Spouses Buado):**  The risk is the potential annulment of the certificate of sale and associated damages if the court finds that the levy on the conjugal property was improper.
*   **Risk to Respondent (Romulo Nicol):** The risk is the potential loss of the conjugal property if the court finds that the wife's debt benefited the conjugal partnership or if the separate action is deemed inappropriate.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 122, Family Code:** Crucial statutory provision determining the liability of conjugal property for personal debts.
*   **Rule 39, Section 16, Rules of Court:** Defines the rights and remedies of third-party claimants in execution proceedings.
*   **_Mariano v. Court of Appeals_ (G.R. No. 51283):** Establishes the principle that a husband cannot be deemed a "stranger" to a case against his wife if the obligation benefited the conjugal partnership.
*   **_Spouses Ching v. Court of Appeals_ (G.R. No. 124642):** Affirmed the ruling in _Mariano_.
*   **_Naguit v. Court of Appeals_ (G.R. No. 7675):** Spouses deemed as strangers to the action when levied execution was on her exclusive/paraphernal property.
*   **_Sy v. Discaya_ (G.R. No. 86301):** Spouses deemed as strangers to the action when levied execution was on her exclusive/paraphernal property.
*   **_De Leon v. Salvador_ (No. L-30871):** Discusses the jurisdiction of the court issuing the writ of execution over its implementation.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Benefit to Conjugal Partnership:**  The critical point of contention is whether the wife's slanderous act resulted in any benefit to the conjugal partnership. The court explicitly rejects this notion.
*   **Husband as "Stranger":** The case turns on whether the husband is considered a "stranger" to the suit against his wife. The court, referencing _Mariano_, clarifies this depends on whether the obligation benefited the conjugal partnership. Since the slander did not, the husband can maintain a separate action.
*   **Jurisdiction of RTC Branch:** Petitioners raised that the case should have been filed where the original case was filed, but the court held that the lower court Branch 21, has jurisdiction because it is considered as a separate claim.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision, affirming Branch 21's jurisdiction.  The key takeaway is that conjugal property is not automatically liable for a spouse's personal debts.  A separate action by the non-debtor spouse is appropriate if the debt did not benefit the conjugal partnership, as in this case with slander. This ruling clarifies the application of Article 122 of the Family Code and the rights of spouses regarding conjugal property.
