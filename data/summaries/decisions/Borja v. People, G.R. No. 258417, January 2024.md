## Legal Document Summary: *Rommel Z. Borja v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 258417)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment finding Petitioner Rommel Z. Borja guilty of violating Section 5(a) of RA 9262 (Anti-VAWC Act).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Petitioner found guilty of causing physical harm (punching) to his live-in partner, Aileen Joy G. Adriatico, violating Sec. 5(a) of RA 9262.
*   **Acquittal (by RTC, affirmed by CA):** Acquitted of violating Sec. 5(e)(4) of RA 9262 (threatening to close her business).
*   **Elements of Sec. 5(a) RA 9262 Established:**
    *   Offended party (Aileen) is a woman.
    *   Petitioner and Aileen had a sexual relationship.
    *   Petitioner caused physical harm. Medico-legal report showed hematoma, incapacitating her for 3-9 days.
*   **Defense of Denial Rejected:** Petitioner's denial was deemed weak and insufficient to overcome Aileen's positive identification and corroborating evidence (sworn statement, medico-legal report, text messages).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Imprisonment:** Four (4) months of *arresto mayor*.  The Court declined to replace imprisonment with community service.
*   **Fine:** PHP 100,000.00.
*   **Moral Damages:** PHP 5,000.00 to Aileen (with 6% interest p.a. from finality of judgment).
*   **Psychological Counseling:** Mandatory, with a report of compliance to the RTC within 15 days of completion.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004):** Specifically Sections 3, 5(a), 5(e)(4), and 6.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266(1):** Defines slight physical injuries.
*   **RA 11362 (Community Service Act):** Allows community service in lieu of imprisonment for certain penalties; court has the discretion to impose community service.
*   **Article 2219 (1) of the New Civil Code:** Pertains to moral damages as a result of criminal injuries.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Discretionary Nature of Community Service:** While RA 11362 exists, the court retains discretion in deciding whether to impose imprisonment or community service. This case highlights the court's emphasis on protecting women from violence, leading to the imposition of imprisonment despite the availability of community service.
*   **Psychological Counseling:** Potential difficulties in enforcement and ensuring the efficacy of mandatory psychological counseling.  The success depends on the availability of resources and the petitioner's willingness to engage in treatment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' conviction of the Petitioner for violating Section 5(a) of RA 9262. The decision underscores the importance of protecting women from violence and the court's disinclination towards leniency (e.g., community service) in VAWC cases where physical harm is proven. The petitioner faces imprisonment, a fine, and mandatory psychological counseling.
