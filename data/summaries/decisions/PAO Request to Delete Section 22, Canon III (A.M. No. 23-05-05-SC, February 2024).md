**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court has rendered a decision finding Atty. Acosta liable for indirect contempt of court and violations of the CPRA and has imposed substantial fines. This decision serves as a strong warning against public disparagement of the court and underscores the importance of upholding the integrity of the Judiciary and the legal profession. The impact of this decision on the relationship between the PAO and the Supreme Court, and the potential chilling effect on advocacy against court policies, should be considered.
