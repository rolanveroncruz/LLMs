**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp.* G.R. No. 226138, February 27, 2024.

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Partial Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court Decision regarding Road Right of Way (RROW) compensation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** The case concerns the government's exercise of eminent domain over a 3.5-kilometer property owned by the respondents for use as a national highway.
*   **Just Compensation:** The central issue revolves around the payment of just compensation to Espina & Madarang, Co. and Makar Agricultural Corp. (Respondents) for the expropriated property. The originally determined amount is PHP 218,839,455.00.
*   **COA Approval (Deleted):** The original SC decision mandated Respondents to file a money claim before the Commission on Audit (COA) for satisfaction of the judgment.  *This provision has been deleted* in the current resolution due to subsequent COA Resolutions.
*   **Interest:**  The Court orders the imposition of legal interest at 12% per annum from June 30, 2007 (deemed date of taking) until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Republic, through the DPWH, is liable for the unpaid just compensation and accrued interest.
*   The Republic is not required to obtain prior COA approval for the payment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Availability of Funds:** While prior COA approval is not needed, the payment is still contingent on the "availability of funds and the usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations," creating potential delays.
*   **Recovery from Olarte Heirs:** The Republic still faces the challenge of recovering erroneous payments made to the Olarte heirs, a separate but related legal issue.
*   **Determination of "Date of Taking":** The Court fixed the reckoning date based on the recommended valuation date, not necessarily the actual date of taking. This could be challenged based on factual evidence.
*   **Interpretation of COA Resolution:** The OSG argued that COA Resolution No. 2021-008 should not be interpreted as a sanction of the disbursement of public funds without COA approval, which means the COA can still conduct a post-audit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article III, Section 9, 1987 Constitution:**  Guarantees just compensation for private property taken for public use.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1445, Section 26:** Outlines the jurisdiction of the COA.
*   **COA Resolution No. 2021-008 (May 12, 2021):** Exempts payment of just compensation based on a court judgment in expropriation proceedings from the COA's original jurisdiction.
*   **COA Resolution No. 2021-040 (December 20, 2021):** Clarifies and supplements COA Resolution No. 2021-008.
*   ***Apo Fruits Corp. v. Land Bank of the Phils.*:** Confirms the power of the court to impose legal interest on just compensation due to delays in payment.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase *"usual accounting and auditing rules and regulations"* pertaining to funds availability needs careful scrutiny to ensure that the respondents receive the just compensation due to them without undue delay.

**Summary for Litigation Strategy:**

This is a largely favorable resolution for Espina & Madarang and Makar Agricultural Corp. The key victory is the removal of the COA pre-approval requirement. Monitor government compliance with payment of just compensation and the application of legal interest. Be prepared to address potential delays based on funds availability or accounting procedures. The issue of interest from the date of taking is now crucial. The Republic's recourse against the Olarte heirs is a separate matter. A key focus should now be ensuring the prompt execution of the judgment, given the long history of the case and the potential for further delays.

**Recommendation:** Review the record to determine if a more precise date of taking can be established to argue for a recalculation of the interest award. Also, develop a strategy to expedite the payment process given the remaining contingencies related to funds availability.
