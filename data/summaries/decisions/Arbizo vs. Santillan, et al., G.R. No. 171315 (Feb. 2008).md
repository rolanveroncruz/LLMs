## Legal Document Summary: *Antonio Arbizo v. Sps. Santillan, et al.* (G.R. No. 171315, February 26, 2008)

**Nature:** Review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court (RTC), which had affirmed the Municipal Circuit Trial Court's (MCTC) dismissal of ejectment complaints. This case concerns possession of three adjoining parcels of land.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in ordering petitioner Arbizo to vacate the properties, holding that respondents Sps. Santillan, Sps. Wassmer, and Marcelo had a superior right of possession in a forcible entry case.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Forcible Entry:** The Court ultimately sided with the CA, ruling that the respondents established a case for forcible entry under Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Prior Physical Possession:** The CA and the Supreme Court held that the Respondents had prior physical possession by installing a fence enclosing the same when they purchased the lots in 1998 and subsequently being forcibly dispossessed by the Petitioner in 2000. This aligns with jurisprudence that forcible entry hinges on prior *de facto* possession.
*   **Deprivation Through Force:** The Court stated that the acts of the petitioner in unlawfully entering the subject properties, erecting a structure thereon and excluding therefrom the prior possessor would necessarily imply the use of force.
*   **Certificate of Title and Tax Declaration:** While not directly addressing prior possession in forcible entry, the respondents' Certificates of Title and Tax Declarations bolstered their claim of having taken physical possession by virtue of ownership.
*   **Summary Procedure:** The MCTC initially relied on the petitioner's evidence of historical possession based on inheritance and deeds of sale of undivided shares. However, the Supreme Court emphasized the role of affidavit testimony permitted under the Rules of Summary Procedure.
*   **Ocular Inspection**: The lower court initially considered the presence of huts on the property in the name of the Petitioner. However, the Court of Appeals stated that due to the timing of the ocular inspection, those huts could have been constructed after the alleged illegal dispossession.

**Obligations:**

*   Arbizo is ordered to vacate the subject lots.
*   Arbizo is obligated to pay each respondent P1,000.00 per month from September 2000 until possession is restored, as reasonable compensation.
*   Arbizo must pay each respondent P10,000.00 as attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:** Arbizo is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** The decision is explicitly provisional, pertaining only to possession. The Court acknowledges the possibility of Arbizo pursuing a separate action to annul the sale to respondents and cancel their titles.
*   **Collateral Attack Doctrine:** The Court mentions the Torrens System and the prohibition against collateral attacks on registered titles in forcible entry actions. This limits Arbizo's ability to challenge the respondents' ownership within the context of this ejectment case.
*   **Question of Fact:** The Supreme Court recognized that due to conflicting findings of fact between the MCTC and the Court of Appeals, the exception to the general rule of only reviewing errors or questions of law applies. As such, the Court examined the factual contentions and ultimately sided with the Court of Appeals.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Basis for the review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 70, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Defines forcible entry.
*   **German Management Services, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 177 SCRA 495, 499 [1989]):** Cited regarding the limited probative value of title documents in forcible entry actions, however, they bolstered the stance of the [herein respondents] that they took physical possession of the subject lots by virtue of such ownership
*   **David v. Cordova [G.R. No. 152992, 28 July 2005, 464 SCRA 384, 389-400]:** Defined "force" in the context of forcible entry, clarifying that it includes any wrongful entry and exclusion.
*   **Bank of Commerce v. Serrano,[26] G.R. No. 151895, 16 February 2005, 451 SCRA 484, 492:** Outlines the exceptions to only reviewing questions of law.

**Recommendations:**

Advise Arbizo that this decision only concerns *possession*. Further legal action (e.g., an action to annul the sale and cancel the respondents' titles) would be necessary to pursue any claim of ownership. Investigate thoroughly the validity of the titles held by the respondents and any potential grounds for annulment (e.g., fraud, irregularity in the sale). Evaluate the cost-benefit of pursuing such further litigation, considering the burden of proof required to overcome the presumption of validity afforded to Torrens titles.
