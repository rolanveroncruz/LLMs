## Legal Document Summary: People v. Abella and Sendiong, G.R. No. 213918 (June 27, 2018)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) joint judgment finding Evangeline Abella and Mae Ann Sendiong guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs - *shabu*) and Sendiong guilty of violating Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (illegal possession of dangerous drugs - *shabu*). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately DISMISSED the appeal and AFFIRMED the lower courts' judgments.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Violation of R.A. 9165:** Abella and Sendiong were convicted of selling 0.01 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in violation of Section 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165. Sendiong was also convicted of possessing 0.01 gram of the same substance in violation of Section 11, Art. II of the same law.
*   **Conspiracy:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' finding of conspiracy between Abella and Sendiong in the illegal sale. Their concerted actions (Abella receiving money, Sendiong handing over the drugs) demonstrated a common agreement and intent to commit the felony.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The defense argued instigation, claiming the poseur-buyer induced them to commit the crime. The SC rejected this, finding the evidence demonstrated *entrapment*. The criminal intent originated with the accused, and law enforcement merely facilitated the apprehension.  The court applied the *People v. Doria* test, examining the conduct of officers and predisposition of the accused.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense challenged the chain of custody of the seized drugs. The SC found that the prosecution established an unbroken chain of custody, addressing each link from seizure and marking ("EM-BB" and "MS-P" markings by PO2 Corsame) to laboratory examination (by PCI Llena) to presentation in court. The inventory was conducted at the scene of the crime with required witnesses present.
*   **Marking:** The court emphasized the importance of marking evidence immediately after seizure and noted that PO2 Corsame marked the sachets in the presence of the accused.
*   **Labelling:** The court rejected the argument that PCI Llena's use of masking tape rather than adhesive tape to reseal the sachets after examination invalidated the chain of custody, emphasizing that the means of preserving evidence integrity are not limited to adhesive tape.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC invoked the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement officers, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, particularly the testimony of the poseur-buyer.

**Obligations:**

*   Law enforcement agencies have an obligation to maintain a clear and unbroken chain of custody of seized drugs, as defined in Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and DDB Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002.
*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the offenses charged, including the identity and integrity of the seized drugs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Abella and Sendiong were found criminally liable for violation of R.A. 9165.
*   Abella was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000 for illegal sale.
*   Sendiong was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000 for illegal sale, and an indeterminate penalty of 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and a fine of P400,000 for illegal possession.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   While the SC affirmed the CA decision, cases involving minor inconsistencies in testimonies of police officers and informants are always subject to scrutiny.
*   The reliance on the presumption of regularity can be challenged if there is evidence of serious procedural lapses or bad faith on the part of law enforcement.
*   The court is cognizant of potential issues in cases involving instances of a lapse in the prescribed procedures of RA 9165 (see *People v. Habana*, 628 Phil. 334 (2010), and related cases), and will not automatically acquit the accused.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 and 11, Art. II.
*   **People v. Doria:** Established the test for distinguishing entrapment from instigation.
*   **DDB Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002:** Defines the "chain of custody."
*   **People v. Habana:** Cited by the defense (and distinguished), involving issues with the chain of custody.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The core defense argument focused on demonstrating instigation, which was ultimately unsuccessful.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense raised concerns regarding the sealing of the sachets and minor testimonial discrepancies, but the SC deemed them insufficient to undermine the integrity of the evidence.
* Inadvertent use of "confidential informant" and "poseur-buyer" by police officers when testifying.
