## Legal Document Summary: Cabreza v. Cabreza, G.R. No. 171260

**Case Overview:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's order to sell a property and issue a writ of possession for the dissolution of a conjugal partnership following a declaration of nullity of marriage.

**Key Provisions/Orders in Dispute:**

*   **January 3, 2001 RTC Decision (Final & Executory):** Declared the marriage null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code; dissolved the conjugal partnership, ordering liquidation per Article 129 of the Family Code, subject to prior rights of creditors.
*   **May 26, 2003 RTC Order:** Granted Motion for Execution re: dissolution of conjugal partnership. Specifically, ordered the sale of the property covered by TCT No. 17460 (the family home) and distribution of proceeds (50% to children as presumptive legitime, 50% split between spouses, with a deduction of PHP 1,500,000 from respondent's share).
*   **Writ of Possession:** Issued to BJD Holdings Corporation after it purchased the property pursuant to the RTC's orders.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   The Order of Possession, Writ of Execution/Possession, and Notice to Vacate vary the dispositive portion of the initial RTC decision (January 3, 2001) by authorizing the *sale* of the family home, which wasn't explicitly stated in the original decision.
*   Relies on Article 129(9) of the Family Code, arguing the conjugal dwelling should be awarded to her as the spouse with whom the majority of the (adult) children choose to remain.
*   Claims another property (TCT No. 17461) existed, making Article 129(9) applicable.
*   Challenges the Deed of Sale to BJD Holdings Corporation due to her alleged lack of consent (subject of a separate, pending case: CA-G.R CV No. 8651).

**Respondent's Arguments:**

*   The May 26, 2003 Order authorizing the sale is *final and executory*, precluding further challenge.
*   Article 129(9) applies only when there are multiple conjugal properties.
*   Raises a procedural question of fact.

**Court's Reasoning & Holding:**

*   **Procedural Bar:** Petitioner is estopped from challenging the May 26, 2003 Order because she had previously challenged it in CA-G.R. SP No. 77506 and G.R. No. 162745, both of which were denied and the denial became final. This constitutes *res judicata*.  Her current arguments should have been raised in those prior proceedings.
*   Petitioner is not candid in disclosing the facts of the case.
*   The Court cannot exercise it's equity jurisdiction because the petitioner had the option of engaging the services of a lawyer on previous occasions but chose to do so on her own accord.
*   Denies the Petition for lack of merit. Affirmed CA decision.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Psychological incapacity as grounds for nullity.
*   **Article 129, Family Code:** Liquidation of conjugal partnership.
*   **Article 129(9), Family Code:** Adjudication of conjugal dwelling.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **J.R. Blanco v. Quasha, 376 Phil. 480 (1990):**  Defines the limitation of the court as not being a trier of facts.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The core issue of the property sale was already litigated and decided against the petitioner in prior cases.
*   **Factual Findings:** Both the RTC and CA found that the property under TCT No. 17460 was the sole conjugal asset, undermining the applicability of Article 129(9) of the Family Code. The Supreme Court defers to these concurrent factual findings.
*   **Collateral Attack:** Petitioner attempts to collaterally attack the May 26, 2003 Order, which has become final and executory.
*   **Separate Case:** The validity of the Deed of Sale is being litigated in a separate case (CA-G.R CV No. 86511), making it inappropriate for consideration in this petition.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, denying the petition due to procedural issues (res judicata) and affirming the factual findings that the disputed property was the sole conjugal asset. The ruling highlights the importance of raising all relevant arguments in the initial challenge to the order for sale and confirms that this Court is not a trier of facts.
