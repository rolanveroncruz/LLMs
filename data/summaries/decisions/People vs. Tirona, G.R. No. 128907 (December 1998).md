## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tirona*, G.R. No. 128907 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a trial court conviction for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. 7659), sentencing the accused to death.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Rape of a six-year-old, Vanessa Gil, alleged to have occurred between June 1993 and May 1994, committed by Alberto Tirona, the family driver.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Testimony of the victim implicating the accused in digital penetration and penile penetration ("buntot").
    *   Medical examination revealed reddening of the perineal area and a laceration of the hymen. While Dr. Villena testified that the hymen was intact, she clarified that penetration can still occur without hymenal rupture.
    *   Dr. Villena's testimony suggests that the congestion of the vestibular mucosa could indicate finger or penile penetration.
*   **Defense Arguments:**
    *   Hymen was intact therefore no carnal knowledge. Court rejects this argument citing *People v. Salinas* and related case law, stating hymenal rupture not essential element of rape.
    *   Motion for new trial denied due to lack of newly discovered evidence meeting the requirements of Rule 121, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Ruling:** Trial court conviction affirmed with modification.  Guilty of rape. Death penalty reduced to *reclusion perpetua*. Indemnity to victim (moral damages) affirmed at P50,000. Additional P50,000 awarded as civil liability *ex delicto* based on the crime.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant, Alberto Tirona, is liable for *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay P50,000 in moral damages and P50,000 in civil liability *ex delicto* to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Dating of Offense & Applicable Law:**  The crucial ambiguity lies in the *exact date* of the rape. The Information specifies a range (June 1993 - May 1994). R.A. 7659, which reimposed the death penalty for rape of a child under 7, took effect on December 31, 1993.  Since the specific date within the range is undetermined and the crime could have occurred before R.A. 7659 went into effect, the court resolved the doubt in favor of the accused and reduced the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*. Cited case law *People v. Godoy*. This could have been more damaging to the accused if it was proven that the attack occurred in 1994.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence for Penetration:** While the court reiterates that complete penetration isn't required, the evidence regarding the extent of penetration could be subject to challenge, given the child's age and potentially unreliable testimony. The court relied on *People vs.. Bugayong* G.R. No. 126518, 02 December 1998, to which ruled that and information charging rape before and until October 15, 1994 was sufficient.
*   **Application of *Ex Delicto* Civil Liability:** The imposition of civil liability *ex delicto* is standard, but the specific amount could be scrutinized based on the severity of the crime and the victim's circumstances.
* **Victim's Testimony**: Given the age of the victim, issues of suggestibility and reliability of testimony may arise. The details obtained in camera were deemed credible and persuasive.
