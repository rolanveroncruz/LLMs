**Case Summary: *Achevara v. Ramos*, G.R. No. 175172 (2009)**

**Facts:** A vehicular accident occurred on April 22, 1995, resulting in the death of Arnulfo Ramos. His heirs sued Cresencia Achevara (jeepney operator), Alfredo Achevara (spouse and administrator), and Benigno Valdez (jeepney driver) for damages under Article 2176 of the Civil Code, alleging Valdez's negligence. The RTC initially ruled in favor of the Ramos heirs. The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Basis of the complaint for quasi-delict.
*   **Negligence:** The Supreme Court ultimately found both Valdez and Ramos negligent. Valdez was negligent by failing to take precautions upon seeing Ramos's wiggling vehicle. Ramos was grossly negligent for knowingly driving a mechanically defective vehicle, establishing negligence *per se* by violating implied safety rules.
*   **Last Clear Chance Doctrine:**  The central contentious issue. The RTC initially applied it, holding Valdez liable for failing to avoid the accident after seeing the defective jeep. The Supreme Court REVERSED, holding that last clear chance was inapplicable because Valdez did not have sufficient time to avoid the collision after the owner-type jeep encroached on his lane.  *Pantranco North Express Inc. v. Besa* (1989) is cited, stating the doctrine doesn't apply when instantaneous action is required.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The Supreme Court held that the negligence of both Ramos and Valdez were the proximate causes of the accident, specifically citing *Article 2179 of the Civil Code.* Ramos' negligence was not merely contributory, but, along with Valdez's, prevented recovery of damages.
*   **Due Diligence in Selection and Supervision:**  Although touched upon by the lower courts, the Supreme Court did not explicitly rule on whether the Achevaras exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of Valdez.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The lower courts had held the defendants solidarily liable. The Supreme Court's reversal eliminates this liability.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the lower courts imposed a solidary obligation on the Achevaras and Valdez to pay damages. The Supreme Court overturned this, absolving all defendants of liability.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The precise timing and distances involved in the accident were critical to the last clear chance analysis, and the court determined that Valdez did not have enough time to react after Ramos encroached on the lane. If the facts were slightly different, the outcome might be different.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Picart v. Smith* (1918): Initially cited for the doctrine of last clear chance.
*   *Pantranco North Express Inc. v. Besa* (1989): Used to refute the application of last clear chance doctrine.
*   *National Power Corporation v. Heirs of Noble Casionan*, G.R. No. 165969, November 27, 2008, provides insight into the definition of gross negligence.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Quasi-delicts.
*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Contributory vs. proximate negligence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, finding that both drivers were negligent, negating the applicability of last clear chance. This decision is based on the interpretation that Valdez could not have avoided the collision, and Article 2179 of the Civil Code was applied to reject respondents' claims.
