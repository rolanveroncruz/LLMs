**Legal Document Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Jesus and Anacorita Doyon***

**Case:** G.R. No. 167238, March 25, 2009 (601 Phil. 401)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Jesus and Anacorita Doyon

**Subject Matter:** Validity of extrajudicial foreclosure of real and chattel mortgages; claim of damages.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Respondents obtained loans from DBP secured by real estate and chattel mortgages (JD Bus Lines vehicles). Loans restructured via three promissory notes in 1994.
*   **Default:** Respondents defaulted on the restructured loans.
*   **First Foreclosure Attempt & Withdrawal:** DBP initially filed for extrajudicial foreclosure (1995), but withdrew the application and moved to dismiss the related Civil Case No. 3314-O, which was granted *with prejudice*.
*   **Second Foreclosure & Damages Suit:** DBP subsequently initiated a second extrajudicial foreclosure through a special sheriff, leading to respondents filing a suit for damages (Civil Case No. 3592-O) alleging bad faith, *pactum commissorium*, and irregularities in the auction notices.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of the respondents, awarding significant damages based on DBP's alleged bad faith and improper foreclosure.
*   **CA Ruling:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision with modification.
*   **SC Ruling:** Supreme Court granted the petition. Court found that DBP had the right to foreclose due to respondents' default. DBP did not act in bad faith. The stipulations allowing the mortgagee to take actual or constructive possession of a mortgaged property upon foreclosure is valid.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:** Obligated to repay the loans per the promissory notes.
*   **DBP:** Obligated to exercise its rights in good faith.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC & CA:** Erred in awarding damages to the respondents because respondents did not have a cause of action against petitioner.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   ***"Dismissal With Prejudice" Clause***: DBP's withdrawal of the first foreclosure application *with prejudice* could have been argued as a waiver of its right to foreclose on the *original* basis, although the SC did not interpret it that way. The precise legal effect of this dismissal was a point of contention.
*   ***Pactum Commissorium Allegation***: Respondents argued that the mortgage provision allowing DBP to take possession of the mortgaged properties upon default was a *pactum commissorium* (prohibited under Art. 2088 of the Civil Code). However, the SC cited *Agricultural and Industrial Bank v. Tambunting* (73 Phil. 555 (1942)) found this provision was valid.
*   **Article 19 of the Civil Code:** Lower courts found that the bank acted contrary to Article 19 of the Civil Code; the complainant must prove that:
    *(a) defendant has a legal right or duty; (b) he exercised his right or performed his duty with bad faith and (c) complainant was prejudiced or injured as a result of the said exercise or performance by defendant.*
    **SC: This was not the case.**
*   ***Notice of Sale Irregularities***: Section 4 of Act 3135 requires that public auctions must take place from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., the respondents claimed that the notice of sale irregularities warranted damages. SC citing *Philippine National Bank v. Cabatingan,* found that  a sale at public auction held at any time between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. of a particular day, regardless of duration, was valid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 19**: Good faith in the exercise of rights.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2088 & 2137**: Prohibition of *pactum commissorium*.
*   **Act 3135, Sec. 4**: Requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure sales.
*   **Executive Order No. 81, Sec. 12**: Deputizing Special Sheriffs
*   **Agricultural and Industrial Bank v. Tambunting,** 73 Phil. 555 (1942): Validity of mortgagee taking possession.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Cabatingan:** Validity of sale at public auction conducted between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. of a particular day, regardless of duration.

**Overall Analysis:**

The Supreme Court overturned the lower courts, emphasizing DBP's right to foreclose upon default. The decision clarifies the scope of permissible clauses in mortgage contracts and emphasizes the necessity of proving bad faith to recover damages under Article 19 of the Civil Code. The key takeaway is that, despite an initial withdrawal *with prejudice*, DBP retained the right to foreclose because the respondents remained in default and the withdrawal of the initial action did not constitute a waiver of the underlying debt.
