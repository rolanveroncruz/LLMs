## Legal Document Summary - D.M. Wenceslao & Associates, Inc. vs. Freyssinet Philippines, Inc. (G.R. No. 166857)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals Decision affirming a Regional Trial Court decision regarding unpaid balance for construction services.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract:** Fabrication and delivery of pre-stressed piles for the NHI project.
*   **Payment Terms:** 30% down payment, 70% progress payments, 18% per annum interest on delinquent accounts (explicitly related to the NHI project).
*   **Issue:** Dispute over an unpaid balance of P322,413.15, initially claimed to be related to the NHI project, but later tied to the IBRD account.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **DMWAI (Petitioner):** Originally found jointly and severally liable with Wenceslao, Jr. (later amended to solely liable) for the unpaid balance. The final decision obligates DMWAI to pay the P322,413.15 balance on the IBRD account with interest.
*   **FPI (Respondent):** To provide evidence substantiating DMWAI's debt concerning the IBRD project

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Interest Rate Application:** While the contract stipulated 18% interest, the court applied 6% from the filing of the complaint for the IBRD account (absent specific agreement) and 12% after the judgment became final and executory. This could raise concerns about the applicability of Article 2209 and the lack of specific evidence of an agreed upon interest rate for the IBRD account.
*   **IBRD Account Jurisdictional Issue:** DMWAI argued the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the IBRD account as it was not initially pleaded. The court ruled that jurisdiction was acquired because evidence of the IBRD debt was presented and admitted without objection, thus issues were tried with implied consent.
*   **Lack of Specific Pleading:** The initial complaint focused on the NHI project debt. The shift to the IBRD account as the basis for liability raises procedural concerns, especially regarding adequate notice and opportunity to defend.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Bank of America v. American Realty Corporation (378 Phil. 1279 (1999)):** Cited regarding the principle that issues not pleaded but tried with express or implied consent of the parties can be validly adjudicated.
*   **Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court:**  Permits amendment of pleadings to conform to evidence presented with express or implied consent, even after judgment. This was the basis for the court assuming jurisdiction over the IBRD account.
*   **Article 2209 of the Civil Code:** Governs interest on monetary obligations in the absence of a stipulated rate, setting it at 6% per annum.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Implied Consent to Trial of Unpleaded Issue:** Whether DMWAI's lack of objection and use of FPI's Exhibit "J" as their own Exhibit "7" truly constituted "implied consent" to litigate the IBRD account claim. DMWAI argued the IBRD account was merely mentioned for offset purposes, not as a distinct cause of action.
*   **Factual Basis for IBRD Debt:** The court relied on statements of account. The specific terms and conditions governing the IBRD account, including interest rates, payment schedules, and any potential disputes, are not fully detailed in the summary.
* The interest rates are in compliance with prevailing rates. This is a point of contention that DMWAI may be able to further argue.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case hinges on the application of procedural rules regarding amendment of pleadings and implied consent. While the court found substantial evidence to support the IBRD debt and that DMWAI had the opportunity to refute it, DMWAI may be able to argue that it was deprived of its due process.
