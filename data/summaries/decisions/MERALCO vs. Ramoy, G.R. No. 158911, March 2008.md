## Legal Document Summary: MERALCO v. RAMOY, G.R. No. 158911 (2008)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, regarding a CA decision ordering MERALCO to pay damages for wrongful disconnection of electric service.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Manila Electric Company (MERALCO)
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Leoncio Ramoy (Matilde Macabagdal Ramoy, et al.)

**Background:** MERALCO disconnected power supply to respondents' property based on a request from the National Power Corporation (NPC) and a MTC decision finding respondents to be illegal occupants of NPC property.  Respondents sued for damages, alleging wrongful disconnection. RTC ruled in favor of MERALCO; CA reversed and awarded damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Service Contract:** MERALCO acknowledges a contractual obligation to provide electricity to respondents. Service Contract states customer must show right or proper interest over the property to assure continuous electric service.
*   **Basis for Disconnection:** MERALCO claims justification based on an MTC ejectment decision (NPC v. Ramoy, et al.) and NPC's request.
*   **Liability:** MERALCO's liability is based on *culpa contractual* (Art. 1170, Civil Code) for breach of contract, specifically, failure to exercise utmost diligence in performing its contractual obligations as a public utility (Ridjo Tape, 350 Phil. 184).

**Obligations:**

*   MERALCO, as a public utility, has an obligation to provide electricity with utmost care and diligence.
*   MERALCO has an obligation to ascertain the finality and scope of the MTC decision before disconnecting service.
*   MERALCO has an obligation to coordinate with court officials regarding the MTC decision and which structures are covered.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Moral Damages (Affirmed for Leoncio Ramoy):**  MERALCO's actions constituted bad faith due to its failure to exercise utmost care, causing wounded feelings and loss of tenants.
*   **Exemplary Damages (Deleted):**  MERALCO's actions, while negligent, did not rise to the level of being wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent (Art. 2232, Civil Code).
*   **Attorney's Fees (Deleted):**  Deleted due to deletion of exemplary damages. No other grounds under Art. 2208, Civil Code are present.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Finality of MTC Decision:** The core dispute revolves around whether the MTC decision was final and executory at the time of disconnection. MERALCO failed to provide conclusive evidence of finality.
*   **Scope of MTC Decision:** The geographic scope of the MTC decision and its applicability to the respondents' specific property is contentious. The ocular inspection revealed that the residence of plaintiffs-spouses Leoncio and Matilde Ramoy was outside the NPC property
*   **Due Diligence:** The court emphasizes MERALCO's higher duty of diligence as a public utility (Samar II Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Quijano, G.R. No. 144474). Mere reliance on the NPC's request and the MTC decision was insufficient.
*   **Causation of Damages:**  The document discusses the link between MERALCO's actions and Leoncio Ramoy's injuries. Only Leoncio Ramoy presented testimonial evidence of wounded feelings.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1170, Civil Code (Culpa Contractual):**  Foundation for MERALCO's liability.
*   **Art. 1173, Civil Code (Negligence):**  Defines the standard of care required.
*   **Arts. 2220, 2232, 2233, Civil Code (Damages):** Governs moral, exemplary and attorney's fees.
*   **Art. 2208, Civil Code (Attorney's Fees):** Lists the limited circumstances where attorneys fees are recoverable.
*   **Radio Communications of the Philippines, Inc. v. Verchez (G.R. No. 164349, 2006):** Explains *culpa contractual*.
*   **Ridjo Tape & Chemical Corporation v. Court of Appeals (350 Phil. 184):**  Emphasizes the high standard of care required of public utilities.
*   **Samar II Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. Quijano (G.R. No. 144474, 2007):** Highlights the public interest nature of electricity service.
*   **Mahinay v. Velasquez, Jr. (464 Phil. 146 (2004):** Clear evidence of the mental and moral suffering must be given for moral damages to be awarded.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court partly granted the petition, affirming the CA's finding of liability for MERALCO but deleting the awards for exemplary damages and attorney's fees. The key issue was MERALCO's failure to exercise the required diligence in ascertaining the finality and scope of the MTC decision before disconnecting service, leading to a breach of contract. This case underscores the high standard of care expected of public utilities and the importance of verifying the legal basis for actions that impact service to customers.
