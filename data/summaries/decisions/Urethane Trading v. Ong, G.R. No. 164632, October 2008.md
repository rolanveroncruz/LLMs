**Case Summary: *Urethane Trading Specialist, Inc. v. Edwin Ong and Leticia Ong*, G.R. No. 164632, October 29, 2008**

**Nature of Dispute:** Petitioner seeks reversal of Court of Appeals (CA) resolutions dismissing its petition for certiorari against an RTC order denying its motion to dismiss a petition for annulment of judgment filed by Respondents.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original MTC Judgment:** The Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) initially ruled in favor of Petitioner, ordering Respondents to pay a sum of money, interest, and attorney's fees for an action on collection.
*   **Annulment of Judgment:** Respondents filed a petition for annulment of judgment with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), claiming lack of jurisdiction due to non-receipt of summons and extrinsic fraud.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Petitioner argues for dismissal based on statute of limitations/laches and waiver/abandonment of claim, asserting proper service of summons and implying voluntary submission to MTC jurisdiction.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC denied Petitioner's motion to dismiss the petition for annulment of judgement.
*   **CA Resolution:** CA dismissed Petitioners case because certiorari is not the proper remedy for interlocutory orders.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents' Liability:**  Potential liability for the original MTC judgment (P295,026.01 + interest + attorney's fees) remains if the annulment petition fails.
*   **Petitioner's Risk:** Further delays and expenses in litigating the annulment petition, including the risk of losing on the merits and the MTC judgment being overturned.
*   **Procedural Risk:** Premature filing of a petition for certiorari to the CA, which can delay the process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 (Rules of Court):** Used by Petitioner to appeal the CA's resolutions.
*   **Rule 65 (Rules of Court):** Discussed in relation to the improper use of certiorari for interlocutory orders.
*   **Rule 16, Section 4 (Revised Rules of Court):** Regarding filing answers after motion to dismiss denial.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Service of Summons:**  Dispute revolves around whether summons was properly served, a key jurisdictional issue. The Sheriff's Return of Summons is contested. Petitioner’s claim of substituted service and respondent Edwin’s presence at a hearing is evidence to be threshed out.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud:** Allegation of extrinsic fraud in the original MTC proceedings forms a basis for the annulment petition.
*   **Statute of Limitations/Laches/Waiver:** These defenses depend on the validity of service and whether Respondents knew of and acquiesced to the MTC proceedings.
*   **Interlocutory Order:** Whether the order denying the Motion to Dismiss may be subject of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.

**Legal Analysis & Advice:**

The Court denied the petition because the denial of a motion to dismiss cannot be questioned in a certiorari proceeding. The grounds raised are based on a conclusion of law that needs to be proven by the parties and resolved by the court. The same principle holds true on the issues of laches, abandonment and prescription alleged in the motion. These involve evidentiary matters requiring a full-blown trial on the merits and cannot be resolved in a mere motion to dismiss.
