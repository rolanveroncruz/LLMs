Okay, here's a legal summary of *Dizon v. Philippine Veterans Bank* (G.R. No. 165938, November 25, 2009):

**Case Summary: *Dizon v. Philippine Veterans Bank***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Rogelio Dizon's appeal in a case involving a Petition for Issuance of Owner's Duplicate Copy of Transfer Certificate of Title.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Dizon (petitioner) mortgaged three parcels of land to Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB) as security for a loan.
*   Spouses defaulted, PVB extrajudicially foreclosed, and acquired the properties at public auction.
*   PVB's Certificate of Sale was registered.
*   PVB initially filed and later refiled a Petition for Issuance of Owner's Duplicate Certificate of Title (TCT) after the original was allegedly lost (L.R.C. Case No. A-124-1024). Dizon opposed.
*   PVB separately filed a petition for a writ of possession. The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC and dismissed PVB's petition for the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   The RTC granted PVB's Petition for Issuance of Owner's Duplicate Certificate of Title. Dizon appealed, which the CA dismissed for failure to file appellant's brief.

**Key Provisions/Issues Raised by Dizon:**

1.  **Prescription:** Dizon argued PVB's petition was barred by prescription under Article 1142 of the Civil Code (mortgage action prescribes in 10 years).
2.  **Authenticity of Titles:** Dizon claimed the titles used as collateral were genuine but altered by PVB employees.  He alleged that the "fake" titles were presented in PVB's initial petition and that PVB was concealing this.
3.  **Perjury:** Dizon alleged perjury by PVB's representative (Atty. Sabalburo) for claiming loss of owner's duplicate copies when, according to Dizon, they possessed copies from the Register of Deeds.
4.  **Identity of Titles:** Dizon asserted the certified copies of titles used in PVB's second petition were the same altered copies used in the dismissed initial petition.

**Holding/Rationale:**

The Supreme Court denied Dizon's petition, affirming the CA's dismissal and upholding the RTC's grant of PVB's Petition for Issuance of Owner's Duplicate Certificate of Title.

*   **Prescription:**  Article 1142 doesn't apply because PVB's petition was based on *ownership*, not a mortgage action. The foreclosure had already occurred and PVB owned the property.  Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) does not provide for a prescriptive period to file this petition.
*   **Authenticity of Titles:** Dizon's allegations of altered titles were unsubstantiated and self-serving.  He was *estopped* from challenging the authenticity of titles he himself submitted as collateral.  Cites Articles 1431 of the Civil Code and *Harold v. Aliba*, G.R. No. 130864, October 2, 2007, 534 SCRA 478, 487.
*   **Factual Issues/Perjury:** Questions of fact are outside the scope of a Rule 45 petition. The Court deferred to the RTC's finding that the titles were lost. Further, *Marcelo v. Bungubung*, G.R. No. 175201, April 23, 2008, 552 SCRA 589, 605 clarifies the Courts power.
*   **Compliance with PD 1529:** PVB sufficiently proved compliance with Section 109 of PD 1529 (notice of loss).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual findings:** The Court heavily relied on the RTC's factual findings regarding the loss of the titles.  This could be challenged if there was clear evidence of abuse of discretion by the RTC.
*   **Estoppel:** The application of estoppel against Dizon hinged on the initial submission of titles.  If Dizon could convincingly demonstrate coercion or undue influence in the initial submission, the estoppel argument might be weakened.
*   **Underlying Fraud (Implicit):** While not explicitly argued, the specter of potential fraud by PVB employees in altering the titles (as alleged by Dizon) lingers. If credible evidence of such fraud emerged later, it could potentially reopen the issue, despite the application of res judicata.
