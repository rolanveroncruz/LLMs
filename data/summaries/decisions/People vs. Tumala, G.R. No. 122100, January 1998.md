**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court acknowledged perceived inconsistencies in Mariefe's testimony but dismissed them as inconsequential, attributing them to the trauma and age of the child.
*   The appeal argued that the lack of conclusive physical evidence should have created reasonable doubt, but the Court relied primarily on the victim's testimony and the accused's flight.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of the accused based primarily on the testimony of the victim, despite alleged inconsistencies and the absence of conclusive medical evidence. The Court emphasizes the importance of credibility of witnesses in cases of statutory rape, and that children may make errors due to traumatic circumstances.
