## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 18-07-131-RTC

**Nature:** Administrative Matter concerning the dropping from the rolls of Noel C. Lindo, Sheriff IV, RTC Quezon City, Branch 83, due to Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** Lindo is dropped from the rolls effective November 2, 2017, due to being AWOL since that date. This is based on Section 107(a-1), Rule 20 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS). The provision allows for dropping from the rolls without prior notice after 30 working days of continuous AWOL.
*   **Right to Appeal:** Lindo has the right to appeal his separation within 15 days of receiving the notice of separation.
*   **Benefits and Reemployment:** Lindo remains qualified to receive benefits he's entitled to and can be reemployed in government.
* Submission of DTR
* Filing leave applications

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Pending Administrative Case (OCA IPI No. 13-4112-P):** The dropping from the rolls is *without prejudice* to the outcome of this pending case. This means any findings of liability or sanctions in that case may still apply, independent of this decision.
*   **Potential for Disciplinary Action in Pending Case:** While the dropping from the rolls is *non-disciplinary* according to Section 110, Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS, the *underlying conduct* (AWOL, failure to submit DTRs) might be considered in the pending administrative case and lead to disciplinary action there.
* Impact to court's operations

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 107(a-1), Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS:** This is the primary basis for the dropping from the rolls.
*   **Section 110, Rule 20 of the 2017 RACCS:**  Defines the dropping from the rolls as non-disciplinary.
*   Reference to previous cases highlighting the disruption caused by AWOL: *Re: Dropping From the Rolls of Rowie A. Ouimno* (A.M. No. 17-03-33-MCTC), *Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Mr. Borcillo* (559 Phil. 1, 4 (2007)), *Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Mr. Faraon* (492 Phil. 160, 163 (2005)), *Re: AWOL of Mrs. Borja* (549 Phil. 533, 536 (2007)). These cases underscore the court's stance on the seriousness of AWOL and the importance of public accountability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Without prejudice to the outcome of OCA IPI No. 13-4112-P":**  While Lindo is separated without losing benefits *at this time*, the outcome of the pending case could impact his future eligibility for government employment and potential forfeiture of benefits, depending on the nature and severity of the findings in that case. The scope and nature of OCA IPI No. 13-4112-P should be determined.

**Action Items/Recommendations:**

*   **Investigate OCA IPI No. 13-4112-P:** Determine the nature of the charges and potential penalties.
*   **Advise Lindo on Appeal:** If Lindo wishes to appeal the dropping from the rolls, advise him on the process and potential arguments, focusing on any mitigating circumstances for the AWOL.
*   **Document Receipt of Notice:** Ensure proper documentation of Lindo's receipt of the notice of separation to comply with the 15-day appeal period.
