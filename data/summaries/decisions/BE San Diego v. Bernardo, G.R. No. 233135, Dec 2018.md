**Case Summary: B.E. San Diego, Inc. v. Manuel A.S. Bernardo, G.R. No. 233135, December 5, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's denial of Petitioner's Petition for Relief.

**Facts:** B.E. San Diego, Inc. (Seller) sold land to Manuel A.S. Bernardo (Buyer) on installment. Buyer defaulted. Seller sued for Cancellation of Contract and Restitution, which the RTC initially dismissed due to non-compliance with the Maceda Law (R.A. 6552) requirements regarding grace periods. The Seller's motion for reconsideration was denied due to its new counsel's procedural lapses (failure to provide notice of hearing). The Seller's subsequent Petition for Relief from judgment was also denied by the RTC and CA.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Sale on Installment:** Governed by Maceda Law (R.A. 6552). Seller is obligated to provide the grace period to the Buyer to comply with installment payments.
*   **Buyer's Obligation:** To pay the remaining balance. Failure to do so leads to Cancellation of Contract and Restitution of the premises.
*   **Procedural Rules:** Rules regarding filing motions for reconsideration, including the necessity of a Notice of Hearing, which is a critical element in the case.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Seller's Risk:** Potential loss of property due to the procedural blunder of their counsel and the initial RTC decision.
*   **Buyer's Risk:** Potential loss of property due to breach of contract if the court decides the case on its merits.
*   **Counsel's Potential Liability:** Possible legal malpractice claim against the law firm of Ramirez Lazaro & Associates due to their gross negligence in handling the motion for reconsideration.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   Whether the negligence of counsel, specifically the failure to file a proper Notice of Hearing, should be imputed to the client, especially considering the potential for significant financial loss.
*   Whether the Maceda Law was correctly applied to the original cancellation of contract case.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Maceda Law (R.A. 6552):** Governs sales on installment of real property and provides specific requirements regarding grace periods and cancellation.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 15:** Specifically Sections 3, 4, and 5, regarding the requirements for a valid Notice of Hearing, particularly in motions for reconsideration.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals, et al., 752 Phil. 15, 25 (2015):**  General rule of negligence of counsel binds the client. Exception: gross negligence violating due process rights.
*   **City of Dumaguete v. Philippine Ports Authority, 671 Phil. 610 (2011):** Discusses instances where technical rules of procedure are relaxed in the interest of substantial justice.
*   **Goldloop Properties, Inc. v. CA:** The filing of respondent-spouses' motion for reconsideration did not stop the running of the period of appeal because of the absence of a notice of hearing required in Secs. 3, 4 and 5, Rule 15, of the Rules of Court.
*   **Curammeng v. People, 199 Phil. 575, 582-583 (2016):** The rule, which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client, may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in the outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property, or where the interest of justice so requires.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Petition for Relief:** The Supreme Court granted the petition, remanding the case to the RTC for a hearing on the merits, holding that the gross negligence of counsel should not be imputed to the client in this specific instance.
*   **Focus on Substantial Justice:** Arguments should continue to emphasize the need for a decision on the merits, rather than a dismissal based on procedural technicalities.
*   **Counsel's Malpractice:** Consider pursuing a separate action against the previous counsel for legal malpractice if damages are incurred.
*   **Compliance with Maceda Law:** In the proceedings before the RTC, argue the applicability of the Maceda Law and demonstrate either compliance or non-compliance with its provisions regarding grace periods.
