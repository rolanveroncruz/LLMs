## Legal Document Summary: *Elpidio Bondad, Jr., y Burac v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 173804)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Elpidio Bondad, Jr. for violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale and possession of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Sec. 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** Appellant was convicted for selling 0.02 gram of shabu to a poseur-buyer.
*   **Sec. 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** Appellant was convicted for possessing 0.04 gram of shabu.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 (Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs):**  This is the *central issue*. The case hinges on the apprehending officers' *failure to comply with the mandatory requirements* of Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules: *specifically, the failure to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized drugs in the presence of the accused, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the DOJ, and an elected public official.*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  The core statute violated.
*   **Section 21(1), R.A. 9165:** Details the procedure for handling seized drugs.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9165, Sec. 21(a):** Addresses non-compliance under justifiable grounds if integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.
*   ***People v. Pringas* (G.R. No. 175928):**  Discusses justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Sec. 21 and the preservation of integrity/evidentiary value.  This case is distinguished.
*   ***People v. Laxa* (414 Phil. 156):** Cites the need to identify items seized as the corpus delicti.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

1.  Conviction based on unreliable testimony.
2.  Admission of evidence obtained in violation of Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165. *This is the strongest argument.*
3.  Irregularities in the buy-bust operation.

**Court's Ruling and Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTS** the petition and **ACQUITS** the appellant.
*   The court found that the police *failed to comply with the inventory and photograph requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165.*
*   Crucially, the court found that this *failure compromised the identity of the seized items (the corpus delicti)*.
*   The Court distinguished this case from *People v. Pringas*, because the defense *raised the issue of non-compliance with Section 21 early on*, during cross-examination and during the offer of evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The **absence of justifiable grounds** for the failure to comply with Section 21 is critical. The prosecution failed to demonstrate *any* reason for omitting the required inventory and photographing.
*   The **evidentiary value of the drugs** becomes highly suspect. Without proper documentation and chain of custody, doubt is cast on whether the substances tested were indeed those seized from the defendant.
*   The case highlights the importance of **strict adherence to procedural requirements** in drug cases. Failure to follow these requirements can result in the suppression of evidence and acquittal, even if the facts suggest guilt.

**Conclusion:**

This case emphasizes the critical importance of strict compliance with the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of R.A. 9165 to ensure the integrity and admissibility of evidence in drug-related offenses. The appellant's acquittal stemmed directly from the police officers' failure to adhere to these mandatory requirements. The ruling reinforces the principle that procedural lapses can compromise the entire case, regardless of other evidence presented.
