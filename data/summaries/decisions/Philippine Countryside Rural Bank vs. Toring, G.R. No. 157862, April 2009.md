**Legal Document Summary: Philippine Countryside Rural Bank v. Toring, G.R. No. 157862**

**Case Overview:**
This is a petition for review on certiorari regarding the propriety of a summary judgment. The central issue is whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Toring, preventing Philippine Countryside Rural Bank (PCRB) from foreclosing a mortgage on a parcel of land.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Mortgage Contract:** Toring mortgaged land (TCT No. 26401) to PCRB to secure a loan. The key dispute revolves around whether the mortgage covered the entire 13,890 sq. m. or only 8,890 sq. m., given prior alleged conveyances of portions to a third party and donation to Barangay Basak.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale & Donation:** Toring allegedly sold 5,000 sq. m. to Edwin Jumao-as and Jumao-as allegedly donated 2,000 sq. m. to Barangay Basak, Lapu-Lapu City *before* the loan. These transactions' validity and PCRB's knowledge are critical issues. A prior RTC order (Cadastral Case No. 19) directed annotation of the deed of sale on the title.
*   **Alleged Full Payment:** Toring claims the loan was fully paid based on a "Cancellation and Discharge of Mortgage" document related to a condominium unit mortgage (CCT No. 209). PCRB disputes that this mortgage secured the *same* loan.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   **Toring's Obligations:** To repay the loan secured by the real estate mortgage. Liability hinges on the scope of the mortgage (entire land vs. partial) and whether the loan has been fully satisfied.
*   **PCRB's Obligations:** Alleged obligation to surrender TCT No. 26401 for annotation of prior conveyances per court order (Cadastral Case No. 19) if the loan is fully paid. Risk of improper foreclosure if Toring's claims are valid.

**Potential Risks:**
*   **Improper Foreclosure:** If the mortgage was only for 8,890 sq. m., and the bank was aware, or if the debt was already discharged.
*   **Liability for Damages:** If PCRB wrongfully withholds TCT No. 26401, hindering Toring's compliance with court orders (Cadastral Case No. 19) and his sale agreement.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**
*   **Scope of Mortgage:** Whether the mortgage contract truly reflects the parties' intent regarding the land area covered. Parol evidence rule may be relevant.
*   **Connection Between Loans/Mortgages:** PCRB disputes the Toring's claim that the loan secured by the condominium unit was a payment for the loan secured by the land.
*   **Admissibility of Branch Manager's Testimony:** Lanete's testimony from another case on PCRB's knowledge of the prior conveyances is contentious.  The court addresses the "judicial admission" issue.

**Statutory References:**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (PD 1529):**  Section 58 concerns the registration and annotation requirements where a conveyance involves only a portion of the land.
*   **Rule 35 of the Rules of Court:** governs summary judgments

**Relevant Case Law:**
*   **Summary Judgment Standard:** Cites *Nocom v. Camerino* and *Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. Guerrero* regarding the purpose of summary judgment and the presence of genuine issues of material fact.
*   **"Genuine Issue" Standard:** Requires the presentation of evidence, distinguishing genuine issues from sham/fictitious claims.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the summary judgment.  Genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the extent of the mortgage, the bank's knowledge, and the loan's satisfaction. The case was remanded to the trial court for a full trial.
