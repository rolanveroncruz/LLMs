## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Valentino Ortiz and Camilla Milan Ortiz vs. Court of Appeals and Spouses Francisco and Bernardina Rodriguez* (G.R. No. 127393)

**Overview:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of the Ortizes' (petitioners') petition for review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision which, in turn, affirmed a Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) ruling in an ejectment case filed by the Rodriguezes (respondents). The dismissal was based on the Ortizes' failure to strictly comply with procedural requirements under SC Circular No. 28-91 (non-forum shopping certification) and SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 (submission of duly certified documents).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Non-Forum Shopping Certification:** The CA dismissed the petition because the certification of non-forum shopping was signed by the Ortizes' counsel, not by the Ortizes themselves. The Supreme Court upheld this dismissal, emphasizing that Circular No. 28-91 requires the attestation to be based on the *party's* personal knowledge. The court rejects the argument of substantial compliance and requires reasonable cause for the party's failure to sign personally, which was absent here. Referencing **Circular No. 28-91**.
*   **Defective Documentation:** The CA also dismissed the petition because the copy of the RTC decision was not duly certified and lacked the required dry seal. The Supreme Court affirms this, stating that strict compliance with procedural requirements is necessary for taking an appeal and that "good faith compliance" is insufficient. Referencing **SC Revised Circular No. 3-96**.
* **Procedural Non-Compliance Leading to Finality**: CA did not allow amended annexes, affirming its original ruling and denying appeal due to the finality of the previous rulings.
*   **Appeal as a Statutory Right:** The Supreme Court reiterates that the right to appeal is not a natural right but a statutory privilege, subject to compliance with the rules of procedure. Cites **Villanueva vs. Court of Appeals, 205 SCRA 537, 544**.
*   **Exceptions to Strict Compliance:** The court acknowledges that procedural rules can be relaxed in exceptional circumstances, but finds no compelling reason to do so in this case. Cites **Limpot vs. CA 170 SCRA 367.**

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Ortizes):** Obligated to comply strictly with the Rules of Court, particularly SC Circular No. 28-91 and SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96, when filing a petition for review. Liable for the costs of the suit.
* **Petitioners' Counsel**: Should ensure compliance with procedural requirements, especially regarding certification and authenticating documents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** The Ortizes have lost their opportunity to appeal the ejectment order due to procedural errors.
*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the Supreme Court's strict interpretation of procedural rules, particularly regarding non-forum shopping certifications and document authentication.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Gabionza v. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 192, Loyola v. Court of Appeals, 245 SCRA 477 and Kavinta v. Castillo, 249 SCRA 604:** Petitioners argued that the CA ruling contradicted these cases. The SC found no merit in this argument, upholding the CA's dismissal.
*   **Santos vs. Court of Appeals, 198 SCRA 806:** Cited for the purpose of orderly administration of justice.
*   **Villanueva vs. Court of Appeals, 205 SCRA 537:** Regarding the right to appeal.
*   **Limpot vs. CA 170 SCRA 367.** Regarding exceptions to procedural rules.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The concept of "reasonable cause" for failure to personally sign the certification of non-forum shopping is open to interpretation. This case implies that the bar is high, requiring a compelling explanation beyond mere inconvenience.
*   The definition of "substantial compliance" is not explicitly defined.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Rules of Court, Rule 41: Governing appeals from RTC decisions.
*   SC Circular No. 28-91: Requiring non-forum shopping certifications.
*   SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96: Regarding document authentication.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court decision emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules in appellate practice. Attorneys must ensure that their clients personally sign non-forum shopping certifications and that all submitted documents are properly certified. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of an appeal, regardless of the merits of the underlying case.
