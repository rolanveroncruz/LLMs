## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Mariano*, G.R. No. 168693

**Case Overview:** This is an automatic review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Jessie Mariano for three counts of rape of a minor, the ten-year-old daughter of his common-law wife. The initial RTC decision imposed the death penalty, but this was modified to *reclusion perpetua* due to the passage of R.A. No. 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Three counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. No. 7659)
*   **Accusation:** Accused-appellant was accused of having carnal knowledge of the victim on multiple occasions.
*   **Medico-legal Evidence:** Dr. Bandonil's examination revealed swelling and redness in the victim's hymen, which the court found to be in support that the accused committed rape.
*   **Penalty:** The death penalty, initially imposed, was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* in light of R.A. 9346.
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court orders that AAA be indemnified for each count of rape as follows: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.
*   The accused is obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused is criminally liable for the crime of rape.
*   The accused is civilly liable for the damages resulting from the commission of the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The defense argued that the victim's testimony was inconsistent and contradictory. The defense also argues that she should have shouted for help, and immediately disclosed to her mother what happened to her on October 29, 1997 while the incident occurred on September 6, 1997. The court, however, found the testimony of the complainant to be consistent and given in a straightforward manner.
*   **Medical Findings:** The defense argued that the medico-legal findings did not confirm penetration. The court considered and ultimately rejected this claim.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The accused argued that it was impossible for the rape to have happened without someone seeing him as they slept together in the same room. The Court considers that rape can be committed even where the rapist and the victim are not alone, considering the anxiety of its discovery.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 4, 2004):** This case modified the rules regarding direct appeals to the Supreme Court in cases involving death, *reclusion perpetua*, or life imprisonment.

*   **People v. Mahinay, G.R. No. 122485, February 1, 1999:** mere touching by the male organ of the labia of the pudendum of the woman's private part is sufficient to consummate rape.
*   **People v. Ramon Regalario, et al., G.R. No. 174483, March 31, 2009:** exemplary damages are called for by way of public example and to protect the young from sexual abuse.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Jessie Mariano but modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* in light of the Anti-Death Penalty Law. The court rejected the defense's arguments regarding the victim's credibility and medical findings, upholding the trial court's assessment. The Court considers the fact that the rape was qualified by AAA being below 18 years of age, and Mariano being the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim.
