## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Plaza* G.R. No. 235467 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs - *shabu*).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165. Requires proof of (a) identity of buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (b) delivery and payment. Requires the presentation and identification of the corpus delicti with moral certainty.
*   **Accused's Argument:** Challenges the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation and compliance with Section 21 (chain of custody) of RA 9165.
*   **Court's Ruling:** Reverses CA and acquits accused based on a break in the chain of custody.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Court affirms the validity of the buy-bust operation, despite minor inconsistencies, relying on trial court's credibility assessment of prosecution witnesses (PDEA Agents). Positive identification of accused by the poseur-buyer established the sale.
*   **Chain of Custody (Crucial Issue):** Court finds the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody as required by Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended.
*   **Initial Seizure/Marking:** While immediate marking, inventory, and photographing at the crime scene were not done, the court acknowledged the exception as provided in the IRR of RA 9165, stating that non-compliance is excusable under "justifiable grounds". The prosecution was able to demonstrate a potential threat to safety as "justifiable grounds".
*   **Gap in Fourth Link (Fatal):** The court identifies a critical gap in the fourth link of the chain of custody: the transition of the seized drug from the forensic chemist to the court.
*   **Lack of Witness Testimony:** The testimony of PSInsp. Signar (forensic chemist) was stipulated, but the stipulation lacked details about who received the shabu at the crime laboratory, who had custody before/after examination, and how it was handled, stored, and safeguarded. This mirrors the issues raised in *People v. Prudencio, 800 Phil. 128 (2016)* and *People of the Philippines v. Mola, G.R. No. 226481, April 18, 2018.* where the failure to identify personnel and document handling procedures led to acquittal.
*   **Chain of Custody Document:** Even with presentation of a Chain of Custody Document (Exh. "L"), no witness testified regarding the document's creation, validation, or the procedures followed during the intervening custody period.
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** Court emphasizes that the presumption of regularity in performance of official duty is secondary to the presumption of innocence.

**Obligations:**

*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving *all* elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including an unbroken chain of custody.
*   Law enforcement must meticulously comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 to ensure the integrity of the seized evidence.
*   Chain of Custody must be clearly established by identifying all persons that handled the drugs, and a clear showing of what they did with the drugs and the protection implemented.

**Liabilities:**

*   The State is liable for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, resulting in acquittal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Inadequate documentation and testimony regarding the chain of custody can lead to acquittal, even if the buy-bust operation is otherwise valid.
*   Reliance on stipulations without sufficient detail can be detrimental to the prosecution's case.
*   Failure to adhere strictly to the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, particularly regarding the identification and handling of seized drugs, creates a risk of compromised evidence and a failed prosecution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines the crime of sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:**  Establishes chain of custody requirements.
*   **RA 10640:** Amends Section 21 of RA 9165 (regarding witness requirements at inventory).
*   **People v. AÃ±o, G.R. No. 230070, March 14, 2018:**  Elements required for conviction under Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165
*   **People v. Prudencio, 800 Phil. 128 (2016):**  Illustrates issues with a stipulated testimony of a forensic chemist, where the identities of the people who handled the drugs and the handling procedures were not identified.
*   **People of the Philippines v. Mola, G.R. No. 226481, April 18, 2018.:** Forensic Chemists must state details as to the chain of custody.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception to the strict chain of custody rule can be contentious, requiring strong evidence of the circumstances preventing immediate compliance.

**Legal Advice:**  This case highlights the critical importance of meticulous chain of custody documentation and witness testimony in drug cases. Prosecutors must ensure a clear and unbroken chain, identifying all handlers and detailing procedures. Relying on bare stipulations is insufficient, and detailed information from the forensic chemist and law enforcement personnel is essential to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Failure to do so creates a significant risk of acquittal.
