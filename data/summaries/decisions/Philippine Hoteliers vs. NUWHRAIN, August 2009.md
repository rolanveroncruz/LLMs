## Legal Document Summary: Philippine Hoteliers, Inc. vs. NUWHRAIN-APL-IUF- Dusit Hotel Nikko Chapter

**Case:** *Philippine Hoteliers, Inc., Dusit Hotel Nikko-Manila vs. National Union of Workers in Hotel, Restaurant, and Allied Industries (NUWHRAIN-APL-IUF)- Dusit Hotel Nikko Chapter*, G.R. No. 181972, August 25, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals Decision granting the P30.00 ECOLA under Wage Order (WO) No. NCR-09 to 144 employees and imposing double indemnity under RA 6727, as amended by RA 8188.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Wage Order (WO) No. NCR-09:** Grants P30.00 ECOLA to employees in the NCR receiving daily wage rates of P250.00 to P290.00, effective November 5, 2001, and fully implemented by February 1, 2002.
*   **Section 13 of WO No. 9:** Addresses creditability of wage increases granted 3 months before WO 9's effectivity as compliance, requires express agreement or CBA provision for such creditability.
*   **NLRC Decision (October 9, 2002):** Ordered retroactive salary increases for Dusit Hotel employees effective January 1, 2001, and January 1, 2002.
*   **Republic Act No. 6727, as amended by Republic Act No. 8188 (Double Indemnity Act):** Provides for double indemnity for employers failing to pay prescribed wage increases.

**Obligations:**

*   **Dusit Hotel:** Payment of ECOLA under WO No. 9 to employees earning between P250.00 and P290.00 daily at the time WO went into effect.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, DOLE determined Dusit Hotel was liable for the ECOLA and double indemnity for non-compliance. This was reversed. The CA reinstated this liability.
*   Ultimately, the SC ordered Dusit Hotel to pay the first tranche of ECOLA (P15/day) from November 5, 2001 to December 31, 2001, to the 82 employees with salaries between P250-290 after the January 1, 2001 raise.
*   Double Indemnity **REMOVED** due to lack of proper notice in the Notice of Inspection Result.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in WO No. 9 Application:** The core dispute revolves around whether retroactive salary increases ordered by the NLRC should be considered when determining eligibility for ECOLA under WO No. 9. The Union argued the increases should not be considered because Section 13 of WO No. 9 prohibits crediting wage increases as ECOLA compliance without an explicit CBA provision, which did not exist.
*   **Double Indemnity:** The enforcement of double indemnity relies heavily on proper notice to the employer. DOLE Department Order No. 10 requires specific warning in the Notice of Inspection Result, a factor absent in this case, which led to its removal by the Supreme Court.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The Supreme Court reasoned that not considering the retroactive increases would result in unjust enrichment for the employees.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 96 of the Labor Code of 1991:** Regarding service charges.
*   **DOLE Department Order No. 10, Series of 1998:** on the impositions of double indemnity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Creditability vs. Eligibility:** The central argument hinged on the interpretation of "creditability" under Section 13 of WO No. 9. The Court clarified this section concerns *substituting* wage increases for ECOLA, whereas the case involved *determining* ECOLA eligibility based on increased salaries.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court partially sided with Dusit Hotel. While acknowledging the employees' right to service charges as distinct from ECOLA, the Court ruled that the retroactive salary increases ordered by the NLRC *must* be considered when determining eligibility for ECOLA. The Supreme Court removed the liability of the hotel to pay double indemnity. Dusit Hotel must pay the first tranche of ECOLA to its employees within the prescribed salaries.
