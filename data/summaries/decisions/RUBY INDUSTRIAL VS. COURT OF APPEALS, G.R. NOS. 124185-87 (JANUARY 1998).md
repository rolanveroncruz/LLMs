## Legal Document Summary: *Ruby Industrial Corp. vs. Court of Appeals* (G.R. Nos. 124185-87)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a dispute over the Revised Rehabilitation Plan of Ruby Industrial Corporation (RUBY), focusing on the validity of deeds of assignment in favor of Benhar International, Inc. (BENHAR) and the propriety of BENHAR's inclusion in the RUBY Management Committee. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision setting aside the SEC's approval of the Revised Rehabilitation Plan.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Rehabilitation Plan Disputes:** The central issue revolves around the Revised BENHAR/RUBY Rehabilitation Plan and an alternative plan proposed by minority shareholders.
*   **Deeds of Assignment Validity:** The validity of deeds of assignment from RUBY's creditors to BENHAR is a crucial point. Prior rulings declared these deeds null and void due to violations of SEC orders during RUBY's suspension of payments (P.D. 902-A).
*   **Preference to Creditors:** Concerns arise regarding preferential treatment afforded to BENHAR under the Revised Plan, as it prioritized BENHAR's reimbursement for payments made under the previously invalidated deeds.
*   **BENHAR's Role and Control:** The appropriateness of BENHAR's membership in the Management Committee and the extent of its control over RUBY's operations is debated.
*   **Circumvention of Prior Court Orders:** The CA and SC found that the Revised Plan essentially circumvented prior court decisions nullifying the deeds of assignment, effectively validating BENHAR's unauthorized transactions.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **RUBY's Obligation to Creditors:** RUBY remains obligated to its creditors, but the Revised Plan improperly prioritizes BENHAR's previously voided claims.
*   **BENHAR's Liability:** BENHAR is liable for actions taken in violation of SEC orders during the suspension of payments period. BENHAR faces potential issues regarding corporate powers (ultra vires) if lending credit is outside its authorized business activities.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflict of Interest:** Henry Yu's dual role (director and majority stockholder of RUBY and stockholder of BENHAR) raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and self-dealing.
*   **Circumvention of Rehabilitation Purpose:** The Revised Plan's focus on reimbursing BENHAR undermines the core principle of rehabilitation: fair and equitable treatment of all creditors.
*   **Equality in Equity:** The principle that all creditors should stand on equal footing during rehabilitation is jeopardized by prioritizing BENHAR.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) 902-A:** Governs the SEC's powers in corporate rehabilitation and suspension of payments. Section 6(d)(2) outlines powers of the Management Committee
*   **_Leongson vs. Court of Appeals_:** Affirms the court's power to correct administrative actions that violate the law.
*   **_Olac vs. Court of Appeals_:** Addresses conflicts between the dispositive portion (fallo) and the body of a court decision.
*   **_Ramos, Sr. vs. Court of Appeals_:** Defines forum shopping and identifies requirements for proving the action.
*   **_Araneta vs. Court of Appeals_** and **_Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation vs. IAC_:** Establish the principle of "equality in equity" during rehabilitation.
*   **CA-G.R. SP No. 18310:** CA decision nullifying the deeds of assignment.
*   **G.R. No. 96675:** SC resolution affirming the CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 18310.

**Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Prioritization of BENHAR's Claims:** The provision in the Revised Plan that allows BENHAR to receive P34.068 Million from RUBY's credit facility as reimbursement for payments made under the voided deeds is highly contentious.
*   **BENHAR's Membership in Management Committee:** The SEC's rationale for appointing BENHAR to the Management Committee, based on BENHAR's alleged status as a creditor (despite the invalidated deeds), is questionable.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly upheld the CA's decision, recognizing the SEC's arbitrary actions and the Revised Plan's circumvention of prior court orders. The case underscores the importance of adhering to the principles of equality among creditors and avoiding self-dealing during corporate rehabilitation. Further proceedings at the SEC are required to formulate a rehabilitation plan that complies with the law and existing court orders.
