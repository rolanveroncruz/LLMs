**Nature of the Document:** Decision affirming with modifications the conviction for Murder.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** Accused-appellants Charlie, Daniel, and Sammy Flores were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Court upheld the lower courts' findings.
*   **Elements of Murder Established:** The prosecution successfully proved (1) death of Larry Parcon; (2) accused-appellants caused the death; (3) killing was qualified by abuse of superior strength; and (4) the killing was not parricide or infanticide. *People v. Gaborne, 791 Phil. 581 (2016)*.
*   **Witness Testimony:** The court gave significant weight to the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Eduardo Mabini, who positively identified the accused-appellants as the perpetrators. Lack of ill motive on witness part was emphasized.
*   **Qualifying Circumstance: Abuse of Superior Strength:** The court found that the accused-appellants purposely took advantage of their superior numbers and strength to overpower the victim, fulfilling the requirement for abuse of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance for murder. One accused held victim, while others stabbed him *People v. Beduya, 641 Phil. 399 (2010)* and *People v. Garchitorena, 614 Phil. 66 (2009)*.
