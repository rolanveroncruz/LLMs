Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution in *A.M. No. 08-1982-MTJ, Daniel P. Almaden, Jr. v. Hon. Victorio L. Galapon, Jr.*:

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of an administrative complaint filed by Daniel P. Almaden, Jr. against Judge Victorio L. Galapon, Jr., and held Almaden in contempt of court, fining him P2,000.00, for filing a malicious and unfounded complaint. The Court found Almaden's complaint to be a mere rehash of a previously dismissed administrative case, A.M. OCA IPI No. 03-1402-MTJ, arising from Civil Case No. 66, an ejectment suit.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dismissal of Complaint:** The primary provision is the dismissal of Almaden's administrative complaint against Judge Galapon.
*   **Contempt Finding:** Almaden was found guilty of contempt of court under A.M. No. 03-10-01-SC, a resolution designed to protect the judiciary from baseless administrative complaints.
*   **Fine:** Almaden is obligated to pay a fine of P2,000.00.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Almaden:** Liable for the fine and potentially further administrative or legal action if he continues to file unfounded complaints.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reputational Damage:** Continued filings could further damage Almaden's reputation.
*   **Escalation of Penalties:** Repeated filings could lead to more severe contempt charges or other sanctions.

*   **Libuit-Lewis v. Moralejo, A.M. No. P-06-2229, January 31, 2007:** Court's duty to protect court employees from unfounded suits.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core issue is Almaden's claim that the writ of demolition was improperly applied to his property. While the Court finds his complaint baseless, the specific facts regarding the location and ownership of Almaden's property, in relation to the ejectment suit, remain somewhat ambiguous.
*   The extent of Judge Galapon's discretion in issuing the writ of demolition, given Almaden's claim of not being a named defendant and residing on a separate property, is implicitly challenged by Almaden's repeated filings. However, the Court sides with Judge Galapon citing that Almaden was not able to prove any fraud, dishonesty or bad faith.
