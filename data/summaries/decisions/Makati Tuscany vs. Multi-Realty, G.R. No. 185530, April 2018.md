## Legal Document Summary: *Makati Tuscany Condominium Corporation v. Multi-Realty Development Corporation*

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (G.R. No. 185530, April 18, 2018) affirming the Court of Appeals' Amended Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 44696.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Makati Tuscany Condominium Corporation (MATUSCO)
*   **Respondent:** Multi-Realty Development Corporation (Multi-Realty)

**Subject Matter:** Reformation of Instrument (Master Deed and Deed of Transfer) regarding ownership of 98 parking slots in Makati Tuscany Condominium.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Master Deed & Deed of Transfer:** Documents executed by Multi-Realty transferring ownership of common areas to MATUSCO. The core issue is whether these documents accurately reflected the parties' intentions regarding ownership of 98 parking slots.
*   **Section 5 & 7(d) of Master Deed:** Stipulate assignment of parking slots to individual units and define common areas. Interpretation of these sections is central to the dispute. MATUSCO argues these sections clearly include the 98 parking slots as part of the common areas.
*   **Reformation of Instrument (Article 1359, Civil Code):** Multi-Realty sought reformation, alleging *mistake* led to the incorrect inclusion of the 98 parking slots as common areas. The court must determine if there was a meeting of the minds, the written instrument did not express true intentions, and failure to do so was due to mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident.
*   **Republic Act No. 4726 (Condominium Act)** Law concerning condominiums.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **MATUSCO:** Risks losing claim to the 98 parking slots, potentially impacting unit owner rights and property value. Potential liability arising from past sales by Multi-Realty.
*   **Multi-Realty:** Potential liability if reformation is not granted and past sales are deemed invalid.

**Key Arguments & Court's Holding:**

*   **Multi-Realty's Argument:** Mistake in the drafting of the Master Deed and Deed of Transfer due to inexperience in condominium development. Subsequent acts demonstrate the intention to retain ownership (sales of parking slots, MATUSCO's offers to purchase the slots).
*   **MATUSCO's Argument:** The Master Deed is clear and unambiguous, no grounds for reformation exist (no mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct, or accident). Multi-Realty should be estopped from contradicting the terms of the Master Deed. The Master Deed is a public document and should be followed.
*   **Court's Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' Amended Decision granting reformation of the Master Deed and Deed of Transfer. The court found that the subsequent and contemporaneous acts of the parties supported Multi-Realty's claim that the original intention was to retain ownership of the 98 parking slots. MATUSCO's conduct (failure to object to sales, offers to purchase the parking slots) demonstrated an understanding that Multi-Realty retained ownership. The court rejected MATUSCO's estoppel argument, finding it knew from its inception that ownership of the parking slots remained with Multi-Realty.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***National Irrigation Administration v. Gamit, 289 Phil. 914 (1992)*** Sets out the requisites for an action for reformation of instrument to prosper.
*   ***Multi-Realty Development Corporation v. The Makati Tuscany Condominium Corporation, 524 Phil. 318 (2006)*** Prior related case between the same parties.
*   ***Rosello-Bentir v. Leanda, 386 Phil. 802 (2000)*** Discussed the need to look at the subsequent and contemporaneous acts of the parties to reflect their intentions.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, 183 Phil. 54 (1979)*** Defines the doctrine of estoppel.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Section 5 and 7(d) of the Master Deed:** The core disagreement centers on whether these provisions clearly include the 98 parking slots within the common areas transferred to MATUSCO.

**Potential Risks/Further Actions:**

*   **Impact on Unit Owners:** Clarification of how the reformation will affect the rights and interests of unit owners who may have believed the parking slots were part of common areas.
*   **Future Disputes:** Potential for future disputes regarding management or disposition of the parking slots.
