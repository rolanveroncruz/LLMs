**Case Summary: People v. Aquino, G.R. No. 125906 (1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the trial court's conviction of Juanito Aquino for Murder.

**Facts:** Accused Juanito Aquino was convicted of the murder of Primitivo Lazatin. The prosecution's case hinged on eyewitness testimony from the victim's wife, Florida Lazatin, and a neighbor, Dominador Rosete, who both identified Aquino as the assailant. The accused presented an alibi, claiming to be at Imelda Valley Camp, more than 30km away, at the time of the crime.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Positive Identification:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings that the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses was credible and sufficient for conviction.  The wife of the deceased positively identified the accused, which was corroborated by a neighbor. Reference is made to the trial court's superior position to assess witness credibility. *See People v. Estanislao, G.R. No. 118079, December 24, 1996.*
*   **Alibi:**  The Court rejected the accused's alibi as inherently weak and insufficient to overcome the positive identification. It was not impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime given the distance between the location of the alibi and the crime scene. *See People v. Obzunar, G.R. No. 92153, December 16, 1996.*
*   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of treachery, qualifying the crime as murder.  The sudden attack on the victim at his window, after having lured him to open it by knocking, ensured the execution of the crime without risk to the assailant. *See People v. Isleta, G.R. No. 114971, November 19, 1996.*
*   **Penalty:** The court imposed the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* due to the presence of treachery and the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The crime was committed when the death penalty was constitutionally prohibited. Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable here, *See Serrano v. Court of Appeals, 247 SCRA 203 (1995)*.  The penalty for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code at that time was *reclusion temporal* in its maximum period to death. The court applied the medium period, *reclusion perpetua*

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Accused found guilty of murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused ordered to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   P50,000.00 as indemnity
    *   P20,000.00 as actual damages (funeral and burial expenses)
    *   P10,000.00 as moral damages

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The judgment relies heavily on eyewitness testimony. While the Court emphasizes the trial court's advantage in assessing credibility, the potential for misidentification, even if unintentional, is inherent in eyewitness accounts.
*   While the distances involved in the alibi defence are relatively small, the timeline and travel methods were not fully explored.
*   The court acknowledges that R.A. 7659 had already been enacted at that time but does not directly comment on the penalties prescribed therein.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 248:** Defines murder and its corresponding penalties.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 64:** Regarding application of penalties when neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances are present.

*   **People v. Isleta, G.R. No. 114971, November 19, 1996.:** Treachery is present when the offender employs means, methods or forms which tend to insure the execution of the crime without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.
*   **Serrano v. Court of Appeals, 247 SCRA 203 (1995)** Indeterminate Sentence Law does not apply to persons convicted of offenses punishable with reclusion perpetua.
