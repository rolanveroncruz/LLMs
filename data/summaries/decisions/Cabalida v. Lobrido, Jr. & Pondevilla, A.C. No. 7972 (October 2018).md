## Legal Document Summary: *Cabalida v. Lobrido & Pondevilla* (A.C. No. 7972)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Attys. Solomon Lobrido, Jr. and Danny Pondevilla arising from their representation of opposing parties in an ejectment case (Civil Case No. 30337).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Allegations:** Petitioner Angelito Cabalida claims Respondents colluded to deprive him of property through unethical conduct related to a settlement agreement.
*   **Factual Background:** Cabalida sued Salili for ejectment (represented by Pondevilla). An amicable settlement (Memorandum of Agreement) was reached where Cabalida paid Alpiere (formerly represented by Pondevilla) P250,000, allowing Cabalida to mortgage the property. Lobrido represented Cabalida in filing the ejectment. Cabalida subsequently lost the property to foreclosure and claims damages due to the respondents' actions.
*   **IBP Proceedings:** The IBP initially recommended suspension for both respondents but the Board of Governors reversed, dismissing the case with a warning. This decision lacked a detailed explanation.

**Court's Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Lobrido:** Found liable for violating **Canon 18 (Competence & Diligence)** and **Canon 18.03 (Neglect of Legal Matter)** of the Code of Professional Responsibility for failing to actively assist Cabalida in settlement negotiations. *Cf. Emiliano Court Townhouses Homeowners Association v. Dioneda, 447 Phil. 408, 414 (2003)*, emphasizing duty to client's interest. **Penalty:** 6 months suspension from practice.
*   **Atty. Pondevilla:**
    *   Found liable for violating **Canon 8.02 (Encroachment on Professional Employment)** for negotiating with Cabalida without consulting his counsel, Atty. Lobrido. *Cf. Camacho v. Pangulayan, 385 Phil. 353, 357 (2000).* **Penalty:** 6 months suspension for this violation.
    *   Also found liable for unauthorized practice of law in violation of **Sec. 7(b)(2) of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct & Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees)** and **Memorandum Circular No. 17, s. 1986**, as he engaged in private practice while serving as City Legal Officer without proper authorization. *Cf. Fajardo v. Alvarez, 785 Phil. 303, 316 (2016).* Further violated **Canon 1, Rule 1.01** of the Code of Professional Responsibility.  This finding was based on his admissions.  *Query of Atty. Silverio-Buffe, 613 Phil. 1, 22-23 (2009)* applied *res ipsa loquitur.* **Penalty:** Additional 6 months suspension for this violation, bringing the total to 1 year. *Cf. Lorenzana v. Fajardo, 500 Phil. 382, 390 (2005) and Catu v. Rellosa, 569 Phil. 539, 550 (2008).*
*   **IBP Board of Governors:** The court criticized the IBP-BOG's summary resolution for failing to adequately explain its reasoning, violating **Section 12(b), Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court**. *Cf. Malonso v. Principe, 488 Phil. 1, 15-16 (2004) and Teodosio v. Nava, 409 Phil. 466, 474 (2001).*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Collusion:** Cabalida's allegation of collusion between the lawyers was not substantiated by the evidence.
*   **Damages:** The Court refused to rule on Cabalida's claim for damages, stating the scope of disciplinary proceedings is limited to the lawyer's fitness to practice. *Cf. Heenan v. Espejo, 722 Phil. 528, 537 (2013).*
*   **Atty. Pondevilla's representation and conflict of interest:** He should not have continued representing interests adverse to the opposing party in the same case.
