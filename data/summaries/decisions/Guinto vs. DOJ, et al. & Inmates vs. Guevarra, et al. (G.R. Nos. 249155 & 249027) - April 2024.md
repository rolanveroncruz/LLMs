Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Guinto v. Department of Justice* (G.R. No. 249027 & 249155, April 3, 2024) (Consolidated)

**Issue:** Validity of the 2019 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10592, specifically regarding the exclusion of persons convicted of heinous crimes, recidivists, habitual delinquents, and escapees from Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) benefits.

**Holding:** Petitions GRANTED.  Rule IV, Section 2, Rule VII, Section 2, and the last paragraph of Rule XIII, Section 1 of the 2019 IRR declared NULLIFIED insofar as they disqualify Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs) who are subsequently convicted by final judgment.  Respondents required to compute GCTA for petitioners consistent with the ruling.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The 2019 IRR, by excluding those *convicted* of heinous crimes, exceeds the scope of R.A. No. 10592. They argue that R.A. No. 10592 only excludes those *charged* with heinous crimes. They also claim that persons convicted of heinous crimes are not prevented from earning benefits under R.A. No. 10592.

*   **Respondents' Argument:** The DOJ acted in an administrative, not judicial or quasi-judicial, capacity in issuing the IRR, making certiorari/prohibition improper. Also, Petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies and had another speedy and adequate remedy of filing a petition for habeas corpus. The exclusion is consistent with the intent and purpose of the law.

*   **Court's Reasoning:**

    *   Certiorari/prohibition are proper to review acts by any branch of government showing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Cites *Araullo v. Aquino III*.

    *   Habeas corpus *is* an adequate remedy for unlawful confinement, but the need for factual determination makes a direct recourse to the Supreme Court improper under the principle of the hierarchy of courts. Cites *Gios-Samar v. DOTC* and *Aspacio v. Inciong.*

    *   R.A. No. 10592 amended Article 97 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) via Section 3. This amendment, using the conjunction "or," creates two distinct classes eligible for GCTA:

        1.  Offenders qualified for credit for preventive imprisonment per Article 29 RPC, as amended by Section 1 of R.A. No. 10592; and
        2.  Any convicted prisoner in any penal institution.

    *   The IRR's Rule IV, Section 2, which excludes recidivists, habitual delinquents, escapees, and PDLs convicted of heinous crimes during service of sentence, *contradicts the plain language of R.A. No. 10592* and *exceeds the scope of delegated legislative power*. Rule VII, Section 2, and the last paragraph of Rule XIII, Section 1 are also invalid for the same reasons.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 10592:**  The central statute being interpreted, amending Articles 29, 94, 97, 98, and 99 of the Revised Penal Code.

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**  Specifically, Articles 29, 94, 97, and 98, as amended.

*   **R.A. No. 7659:** Defines heinous crimes in the Philippines, and provides important historical context.

*   **R.A. 9346**: Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines (2006).

*   **Inmates of New Bilibid Prison v. De Lima:** Previous case ordering recomputation of time allowances under R.A. No. 10592.

*   **Araullo v. Aquino III:**  Addresses the scope of certiorari and prohibition.

*   **Gios-Samar v. DOTC:**  Reiterates the doctrine of the hierarchy of courts.

*   **Aspacio v. Inciong:**  Highlights the Supreme Court's role as primarily an applier of law, not a trier of fact.

*   **Calalang v. Williams:**  Establishes the power of subordinate legislation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "this Act" within the exclusionary proviso of Article 29 is a key point of contention. The Court determined that it referred to all of R.A. 10592.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   The ruling *requires* the BuCor, BJMP, and DOJ to recompute GCTA for affected PDLs, potentially leading to the release of individuals convicted of heinous crimes.
*   There could be public backlash due to concerns about public safety.
*   There could be possible legislative action to amend the law to clarify the scope of the GCTA benefits, in response to public concerns.
