## Legal Document Summary: *PO2 Jessie Flores y De Leon v. People of the Philippines*

**Case:** G.R. No. 222861, April 23, 2018 - Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for Simple Robbery (Extortion) under Article 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** PO2 Jessie Flores was charged with simple robbery (extortion) for demanding and receiving P2,000 from Roderick France in exchange for the return of his driver's license which was confiscated after a traffic accident.
*   **Entrapment:** The arrest stemmed from an entrapment operation conducted by the PAOCTF. Marked money was used.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   *Prosecution:* Testimony of France, PO2 Ilao, and PO2 Menor. Photocopies of the Complaint Sheet, Karagdagang Sinumpaang Salaysay, and Traffic Violation Receipt (TVR) were presented. The original marked money was not presented.
    *   *Defense:* Testimony of PO2 Flores, Robert Pancipanci, and Toto Ronaldo, asserting denial and frame-up.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   RTC: Convicted PO2 Flores of Simple Robbery (Extortion).
    *   CA: Affirmed the conviction with modification of the penalty, appreciating the aggravating circumstance of abuse of authority.

**Obligations:**

*   PO2 Flores had the obligation to conduct traffic investigations within legal and ethical bounds, but he was not authorized to withhold an offender's license and receive payments for its return.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of Simple Robbery (Extortion) under Article 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code. Sentenced to a penalty of two (2) years, Four (4) months, and One (1) day as minimum to eight (8) years and One (1) day of prision mayor as maximum.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Best Evidence Rule:** The defense argued that the photocopies presented as evidence violated the Best Evidence Rule. The CA ruled these admissible as exceptions for public records and documents admitted to be authentic.
*   **Non-Presentation of Original Marked Money:** The defense challenged the conviction due to the non-presentation of the original marked money. The Court found this was not fatal, citing *People v. Tandoy*, because the money was only used to establish existence, not content. Serial numbers were recorded.
*   **Failure to Present Forensic Chemist:** The defense argued for acquittal based on the prosecution's failure to present the forensic chemist who tested for fluorescent powder. The court determined the fluorescent powder to not be indispensable evidence
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense highlighted inconsistencies between France's sworn statement and in-court testimony. The Court applied *Kummer v. People*, stating that affidavits are generally less reliable than in-court testimony.
*   **Administrative Case Exoneration:** The defense asserted that exoneration in an administrative case should warrant dismissal of the criminal case, citing *Constantino v. Sandiganbayan*. The Court distinguished this case, emphasizing the independence of administrative and criminal proceedings and the different evidentiary standards required, citing *Paredes v. Court of Appeals*. *Constantino* only applies where the very act being assessed had been factually disproved.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision. The Court ruled that the prosecution sufficiently established all elements of simple robbery (extortion) beyond a reasonable doubt, that the testimonial evidence and the circumstances surrounding the case supported the conviction, and that the exoneration in the administrative case did not preclude the criminal prosecution. PO2 Flores' actions constituted intimidation and abuse of authority for personal gain.
