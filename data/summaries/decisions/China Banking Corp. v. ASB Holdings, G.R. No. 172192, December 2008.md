## Legal Document Summary: *China Banking Corporation v. ASB Holdings, Inc.* G.R. No. 172192

**Subject:** Petition for Review of CA Decision upholding SEC approval of ASB Development Corporation's corporate rehabilitation plan.

**Key Issue:** Whether the ASB rehabilitation plan violates the principles of mutuality of contracts, curtails a party's freedom to contract, and presents an accurate picture of the debtor's financial condition, particularly concerning China Bank's secured creditor status.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, AFFIRMING the CA decision which upheld the SEC's approval of the ASB rehabilitation plan.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dacion en Pago:** The plan includes a *dacion en pago* proposal (transfer of properties in lieu of payment) for secured creditors. However, the plan explicitly states that the *dacion en pago* is *not compulsory* and requires mutual agreement between ASB and the creditor. If no agreement on *dacion en pago*, payment will be settled at selling prices for the general interest of all stakeholders.
*   **Suspension Order:** The SEC's order approving the plan and appointing a receiver suspends actions for claims against ASB, but *does not extinguish* China Bank's secured creditor status or its lien on mortgaged properties.
*   **Debt Restructuring:** The plan contemplates debt restructuring, possible liquidation through *dacion en pago*, transfer, assignment, or outright sale of assets.

**Obligations:**

*   **ASB:** Obligated to follow the approved rehabilitation plan and seek mutual agreement for *dacion en pago*. Has ongoing obligation to address the debt of its creditors and rehabilitate the business.
*   **China Bank:** Subject to the suspension order regarding legal actions but retains its rights as a secured creditor. No obligation to accept the dacion en pago, but must act in good faith to ensure a viable and equitable solution for both parties.

**Liabilities:**

*   **ASB:** Remains liable for its debts to China Bank and other creditors.
*   **China Bank:** Faces potential risk of delayed recovery of its debt but retains priority over unsecured creditors.

**Potential Risks for China Bank:**

*   **Delayed Recovery:** While retaining its secured status, the implementation of the rehabilitation plan might result in a longer timeframe for full recovery of the debt.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** Potential for disputes regarding the "selling price" of mortgaged properties should dacion fail and ASB exercises their right to sell property in order to resolve the debt.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A (as amended):**  Governs corporate rehabilitation and suspension of actions against distressed corporations.  Specifically, Section 6(c) regarding suspension of actions.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. ASB Holdings, Inc.*** **(G.R. No. 166197):**  A prior case involving the same rehabilitation plan, affirming that the plan doesn't impair contract rights, and that dacion is not compulsory.
*   ***Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Securities and Exchange Commission*** **(G.R. No. 164641):**  Reiterates that the SEC's approval of a rehabilitation plan doesn't impair the right to contract, and that dacion is a contractual arrangement requiring consent.
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court** : Confirmed that the action of suspension does not render ineffective the status of a secured creditor as compared to a totally unsecured creditor
*   **Constitutional Provisions:** Referenced concerning the non-impairment of contracts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Selling Prices" Determination:** The method for determining the "selling prices" of mortgaged properties (if the *dacion en pago* fails) is not clearly defined in the summary of the document. This could be a point of contention.
*   **Viability of Rehabilitation:** The document mentions some concerns about the viability of the rehabilitation plan but says that most creditors obligations are met.
*   **Waiver of Penalties and Interest:** The court recognized that the waiver of penalties and interest is not compulsory and only a proposal. However, this remains a point of contention.

**Legal Advice:** China Bank should carefully monitor the implementation of the rehabilitation plan, actively participate in negotiations regarding *dacion en pago* or property valuation, and consider all legal options to protect its interests as a secured creditor. They should be prepared to assert their rights during liquidation proceedings if rehabilitation fails. Further investigation into the specific terms of the rehabilitation plan, particularly the valuation methods and the rights of secured creditors, is recommended.
