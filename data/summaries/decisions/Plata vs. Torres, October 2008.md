## Summary of *Plata v. Torres*, A.M. No. MTJ-08-1721

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Judge Lizabeth G. Torres (MeTC, Mandaluyong City, Branch 60) for grave abuse of discretion, gross negligence, serious inefficiency, and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Incident:** Judge Torres failed to resolve a Motion to Withdraw Information (re: Attempted Homicide charge against Plata) filed by the City Prosecutor on July 29, 1999, pursuant to a DOJ resolution directing the withdrawal.  The motion was not resolved until September 15, 2006, over five years after it was filed and over five years after a manifestation for its early resolution was filed by the complainant.
*   **DOJ Resolution:** Department of Justice (DOJ) Resolution No. 305 directed the withdrawal of the Information. The Motions for Reconsideration were denied by the Secretary of Justice Serafin R. Cuevas.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Judge Torres failed to comment on the administrative complaint despite multiple extensions and a "show cause" order from the Supreme Court, leading to a P1,000 fine. Her explanation and comment were submitted over three years after the initial request.
*   **Defense:**  Judge Torres cited overwhelming workload, lack of court personnel, designation as pairing judge and Executive Judge and marital problems as justification for the delay.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Judge Torres violated Canon 6 of the Code of Judicial Ethics regarding prompt disposition of cases.
*   Judge Torres failed to comply with Supreme Court resolutions directing her to comment on the administrative complaint.

**Liabilities Imposed:**

*   **Undue Delay:** Fined P10,000.00 for undue delay in resolving the Motion to Withdraw Information.
*   **Insubordination/Gross Misconduct:** Fined another P10,000.00 for repeated failure to comply with Supreme Court directives.
*   **Warning:** Any repetition of similar offenses will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court considered the heavy workload and personal problems as mitigating factors, leading to a reduced fine. This suggests a balancing act where workload *may* partially excuse delays, but not completely exonerate.
*   **Disregard of Supreme Court Orders:** The Court emphasized the importance of complying with its directives. This illustrates the potential for serious consequences when judges disregard such orders, potentially leading to more severe penalties in future cases.
* **Rule 140, Section 2 of the Rules of Court**: Undue delay in rendering a decision is considered a less serious charge punishable by either suspension from office without salary for not less than one (1) month or more than three (3) months, or a fine of more than P10,000.00 but not exceeding P20,000.00.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution:** Mandates speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Code of Judicial Ethics, Canon 6:** Requires prompt disposition of matters.
*   **Rule 140, Section 2 of the Rules of Court:** Addresses undue delay in rendering a decision.

*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Espa√±ol, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1872, October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 332:** Highlights the principle that justice delayed is justice denied.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The level of workload and personal problems that would constitute sufficient mitigating circumstances is not precisely defined, leaving room for subjective interpretation in future cases.
