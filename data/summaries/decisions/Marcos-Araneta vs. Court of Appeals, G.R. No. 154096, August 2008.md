## Legal Document Summary: Marcos-Araneta v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 154096, August 22, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision annulling RTC orders that admitted petitioners' amended complaint.

**Key Issue:** Improper venue in a case for conveyance of shares of stock based on a purported trust.

**Background:**

*   Irene Marcos-Araneta (Irene) filed complaints against the Benedicto Group seeking the reconveyance of 65% of shares in FEMII and UEC, alleging Benedicto held the shares in trust for her.
*   The RTC initially dismissed the complaints due to improper venue, finding Irene was not a resident of Ilocos Norte.
*   Irene then filed an amended complaint, adding residents of Ilocos Norte as co-plaintiffs (as trustees). The RTC admitted the amended complaint.
*   The CA reversed the RTC, holding the admission of the amended complaint was erroneous and venue improper.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Trust Claim:** Irene alleges an express or implied trust was created in her favor by Benedicto. The Court notes the uncertainty in whether the trust is implied or express.
    *   **Risk:** The specific nature of the trust (express vs. implied) is critical as express trusts involving immovable property require written proof (Art. 1443, Civil Code).
    *   **Risk:** Art. 1446 of the Civil Code provides the beneficiary of an express trust must accept the trust if it imposes onerous conditions.
*   **Amendment of Complaint:**  The Court reiterates that a party can amend their pleading once as a matter of right before a responsive pleading is served (Rule 10, Sec. 2, Rules of Court). A motion to dismiss is NOT a responsive pleading.
    *   **Finding:** The RTC properly admitted the amended complaint because the defendants had not yet filed an answer.
*   **Venue:** The key issue is whether venue was properly laid in Batac, Ilocos Norte.
    *   **Rule 4, Sec. 2 (Venue of Personal Actions):** Venue is proper where the plaintiff or ANY of the *principal* plaintiffs resides.
    *   **Analysis:** Irene is the *principal* plaintiff, as the real party in interest (Rule 3, Sec. 2). The added co-plaintiffs are merely representatives (trustees) of Irene, and their residency is therefore irrelevant to the venue determination.
    *   **Finding:** Irene is not a resident of Ilocos Norte, as determined by the RTC. Therefore, venue in Batac is improper. The Court cites Justice Feria and Regalado in their interpretation of the term “principal” in Rule 4 Section 2.
*   **Waiver of Improper Venue:** Defendants did *not* waive improper venue because they raised it in their motion to dismiss.

**Obligations:**

*   Irene has the obligation to prosecute her case in the proper venue, where she resides.
*   The trustees (co-plaintiffs) have the obligation to act in the best interest of the beneficiary of the trust (Irene).

**Liabilities:**

*   If Irene continues to pursue the case in an improper venue, she risks dismissal of her case.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Trust:** Irene bears the burden of proving the existence and validity of the alleged trust. If she fails to do so, her case will be dismissed.
*   **Improper Venue:** The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the amended complaint because of improper venue.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 3 (Parties to Civil Actions), Rule 4 (Venue of Actions), Rule 7 (Verification and Certification), Rule 10 (Amendment of Pleadings), Rule 16 (Motion to Dismiss)
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1443, 1446
*   **Relevant jurisprudence:** _Kimberly Independent Labor Union v. Court of Appeals_, _Enopia v. Court of Appeals_, _Cavile v. Heirs of Clarita Cavile_, _Alpine Lending Investors v. Corpuz_, _Romualdez-Marcos v. Commission on Elections_

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The nature of the trust (express vs. implied) is not clearly defined in the complaint, which impacts the evidentiary requirements.
*   Validity and enforceability of the trust agreement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the case due to improper venue. While the Court reversed some of the CA's reasoning, it agreed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to Irene's non-residence in Ilocos Norte. Irene, as the principal plaintiff, was required to file her case in the place of her residence. Moving forward, if Irene wishes to pursue her claim, she must refile the case in the proper venue, and be prepared to adequately prove the existence, nature and terms of the trust agreement.
