**Case Summary: *Henry Dela Rama Co v. Admiral United Savings Bank*, G.R. No. 154740, April 16, 2008**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision reversing the RTC and holding Co liable for a loan deficiency.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Note:** Co executed a promissory note for P500,000.00 payable to Admiral United Savings Bank (ADMIRAL) with 18% interest per annum and 10% service charge, due on or before February 23, 1984.  The note also stipulates 3% per month liquidated damages and collection/legal fees in case of default.
*   **Co-Maker:** Leocadio O. Isip was a co-maker, but the claim against him was dropped due to his death.
*   **Co's Defense:** Co claimed he was merely an accommodation party for Metropolitan Rentals & Sales, Inc. (METRO RENT), received no benefit, the debt was paid (cession of vehicles and condonation/novation), ADMIRAL was guilty of laches, and the case was prematurely filed.  He also filed a third-party complaint against METRO RENT.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Principal Liability:** CA held Co liable for the principal amount of P500,000.00.
*   **Interest:** 18% per annum from February 28, 1984, until fully paid.
*   **Service Charge:** Reduced by the Supreme Court from 10% to 2% per annum (or P10,000/year) from February 28, 1984.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** Reduced by the Supreme Court from 3% per month to a lump sum of P150,000.00.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Reduced by the Supreme Court from 25% of total amount due to a lump sum of P50,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accommodation Party Defense:** The court rejected Co's defense that he was merely an accommodation party. *Ang v. Associated Bank, G. R. No. 146511, September 5, 2007* reinforces that an accommodation party is liable to a holder for value, even without receiving consideration.
*   **Proof of Payment:**  Co failed to prove payment. The Release of Real Estate Mortgage was deemed insufficient as it wasn't directly linked to the promissory note, referencing *Alonzo v. San Juan, G.R. No. 137549, February 11, 2005*.  The burden of proving payment rests on the debtor.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage Release:**  The cancellation of the mortgage did not extinguish the underlying debt, as the promissory note is the principal obligation.
*   **Penalty Clauses:**  While liquidated damages and attorney's fees are stipulated in the promissory note (akin to a penal clause as discussed in *Titan Construction Corporation v. Uni-Field Enterprise, G.R. No. 153874, March 1, 2007*), the Supreme Court exercised its power under Articles 1229 and 2227 of the Civil Code to equitably reduce them due to their unconscionable nature, highlighting the principle of fairness.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1229:** Equitable reduction of penalties.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2227:** Equitable reduction of liquidated damages.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 1:** Burden of proof.

**Case Law:**

*   **Ang v. Associated Bank, G. R. No. 146511, September 5, 2007:**  Liability of accommodation party.
*   **Sierra v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 90270, July 24, 1992:** Promissory note is a solemn acknowledgment of debt.
*   **Alonzo v. San Juan, G.R. No. 137549, February 11, 2005:** Proof of payment.
*   **Bulos, Jr. v. Yasuma, G.R. No. 164159, July 17, 2007:**  Burden of proving payment.
*   **L.M. Handicraft Manufacturing Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 90047, June 18, 1990:** Service charge limits for banks.
*   **Titan Construction Corporation v. Uni-Field Enterprise, G.R. No. 153874, March 1, 2007:** Nature of attorney's fees as liquidated damages (penal clause).

**Conclusion:** Co is liable for the loan, but the Supreme Court mitigated the damages awarded by the CA, particularly the excessive liquidated damages and attorney's fees, based on principles of equity.  His defenses of being an accommodation party and payment were unsuccessful due to lack of evidence. The ambiguous clause relating to service charges was addressed by reducing the rate to a maximum of 2% per annum.
