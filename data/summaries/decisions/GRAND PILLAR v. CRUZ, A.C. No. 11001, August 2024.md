**Legal Document Summary: *Grand Pillar International Development, Inc. v. Atty. Nini D. Cruz***

**Nature of Document:** Decision on an administrative complaint for disbarment against Atty. Nini D. Cruz for malpractice and deceit.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** A prior civil case (Civil Case No. 119-0-2008) involving Grand Pillar, Josephine Lim (represented by Atty. Cruz), resulting in a Compromise Agreement approved by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Compromise Agreement Terms:** Lim was to provide receipts and authorize withdrawal of consigned funds (₱8,037,523.00) by Grand Pillar, and Grand Pillar was to convey 10 properties to Lim.
*   **Dispute:** Lim failed to pay the remaining balance of ₱1,994,769.50. Atty. Cruz tendered a Manager's Check for ₱2,000,000.00 on behalf of Lim to the RTC.
*   **Critical Issue:** The Manager's Check was owned by Gracita Domingo-Agaton, another client of Atty. Cruz. Domingo-Agaton demanded its return from Grand Pillar, initiating separate legal action against both Grand Pillar and Atty. Cruz.
*   **Atty. Cruz's Default:** Atty. Cruz repeatedly failed to respond to Court and IBP directives, including filing comments, attending mandatory conferences, and submitting position papers.
*   **Prior Disbarment:** Atty. Cruz was previously disbarred in *A.C. No. 11023, Domingo-Agaton v. Cruz* for misappropriating Domingo-Agaton's check.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** Initially recommended disbarment, then modified to a fine of ₱100,000.00 given prior disbarment. An additional fine of ₱20,000 was recommended for failure to comply with IBP directives.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Court DISMISSED the disbarment complaint based on *res judicata* (bar by prior judgment), finding identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action with *Domingo-Agaton v. Cruz*.
*   **Sanction for Disobedience:** Although disbarment was barred, the Court imposed a FINE of ₱50,000.00 on Atty. Cruz for her repeated defiance of Court and IBP orders, classified as a less serious offense under Canon VI, Section 34 of the CPRA.

**Obligations:**

*   Atty. Cruz has a continuing obligation to respect the Court and the Integrated Bar, and to comply with their directives (Canon VI of CPRA).
*   Payment of FINE of Php 50,000.00.

**Liabilities:**

*   While not disbarred *again*, Atty. Cruz is liable for the fine of Php 50,000.00 for failing to comply with the lawful orders and processes of the Court and the IBP.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   While the case was dismissed, the Supreme Court is signaling tolerance towards continued non-compliance with directives from the Court and IBP.
*   The imposition of the Php 50,000 fine may open Atty. Cruz to further disciplinary measures, should she continue to disregard the orders of the Supreme Court and IBP.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Res Judicata:** *Heirs of Gabule v. Jumuad, 887 Phil. 575 (2020)*; *Heirs of Elliot v. Corcuera, 880 Phil. 232 (2020)*. These cases define the elements of *res judicata* (both bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment).
*   ***Domingo-Agaton v. Cruz, A.C. No. 11023, May 4, 2021***: This case is central, as it resulted in Atty. Cruz's prior disbarment based on the same underlying facts.
*   **Canon VI, Section 34 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA):** Defines "less serious offenses," including disobedience to court orders.
*   **Canon VI, Section 37(b) of the CPRA:** Outlines sanctions for less serious offenses, including fines.
*   *Kelly v. Robielos III, A.C. No. 13955, January 30, 2024*. Lawyer must maintain respect to courts, judicial officers, and duly constituted authorities, including IBP.
