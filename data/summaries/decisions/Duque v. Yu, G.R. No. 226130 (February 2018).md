**Case:** *Lilia S. Duque, et al. vs. Spouses Bartolome D. Yu, Jr., et al.* G.R. No. 226130, February 19, 2018

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of a Deed of Donation and subsequent Deed of Absolute Sale of a property initially owned by Spouses Duque. Spouses Duque filed suit alleging forgery of the Deed of Donation to their daughter, Capacio, who then sold a portion to Spouses Yu. The RTC dismissed the complaint based on the implied admission rule for failure of the Duques to respond to a request for admission, which the CA affirmed. The Supreme Court reversed, finding no implied admission and ultimately ruling in favor of the Duques, declaring the deeds void due to forgery.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Subject Property:** 7,000 sq. meter lot in Lambug, Badian, Cebu.
*   **Deed of Donation:** Allegedly executed by Spouses Duque in favor of daughter, Delia D. Capacio. Determined to be forged based on expert testimony and Capacio's admission.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:** Capacio sold 2,745 sq. meters of the subject property to Spouses Yu. Declared void due to the invalidity of the underlying Deed of Donation. *Nemo dat quod non habet* principle applied (Cavite Development Bank, et al. v. Spouses Lim, et al., G.R. No. 131679, February 1, 2000).
*   **Tax Declarations:** Original TD restored to Spouses Duque. TDs in names of Capacio and Yu cancelled.

**Obligations:**

*   The order effectively reinstates Spouses Duque’s/ their heirs’ ownership rights over the property, free from claims of ownership under the void deeds.

**Liabilities:**

*   Capacio liable to refund Spouses Yu the purchase price of the portion of the subject property. (See footnote 15)

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Damages:**  Spouses Yu may potentially seek damages against Capacio based on breach of contract or fraud related to the invalid sale.
*   **Ejectment:** Spouses Yu may be subject to ejectment proceedings if they continue to occupy the portion of the subject property.
*   **Title Complications:** Further title complications could arise if Spouses Yu had further transferred or encumbered the property based on the now-invalid deed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 26, Sections 1 & 2, Rules of Court:**  Governs request for admission and implied admission.  The Court clarified the rule: implied admission does not apply when matters have already been denied in prior pleadings (Metro Manila Shopping Mecca Corp. v. Toledo, G. R. No. 190818, June 5, 2013, 697 SCRA 425).
*   **Section 1, Rule 33 of the Rules of Court:** Explains the consequences when a Demurrer of evidence is overruled on appeal (Generoso Villanueva Transit Co., Inc. v. Javellana, No. L-29467, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 755).
*   ***Nemo dat quod non habet*** Cavite Development Bank, et al. v. Spouses Lim, et al., G.R. No. 131679, February 1, 2000.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Deed of Donation itself was at the heart of the dispute, with the core issue being the alleged forgery. No specific clauses are highlighted as being ambiguous beyond the entire document's validity being contested.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The Court focused on the procedural error of the lower courts in applying the implied admission rule when the authenticity of the Deed of Donation had already been disputed in the initial complaint.
*   The SC’s decision relied heavily on the factual finding of forgery. If the factual underpinning of forgery is later challenged or overturned (although unlikely given the prior proceedings), the entire case could be revisited.
