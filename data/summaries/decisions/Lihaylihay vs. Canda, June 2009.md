**Case Summary: *Lihaylihay v. Judge Canda***

**Citation:** 607 Phil. 345 (2009) (A.M. No. MTJ-06-1659, A.M. No. P-06-2254, A.M. No. MTJ-09-1730)

**Facts:** This case involves multiple administrative complaints filed by a court employee, Anna Jane D. Lihaylihay, against Judge Alejandro T. Canda, and a counter-complaint by Judge Canda. The central issue revolves around Judge Canda's conduct towards Lihaylihay following a dispute over a vacant Sheriff position. Key events include threatening text messages, administrative complaints accusing Lihaylihay of misconduct and describing her with derogatory terms like "GRO" and "whore," publication of these accusations in a local newspaper (Mindanao Observer), and Judge Canda filing a libel case against Lihaylihay after she published a reply.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court found Judge Canda guilty of **Gross Misconduct Constituting Violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct** and imposed a fine of P40,000, sternly warning against future similar acts. Lihaylihay was previously admonished for irresponsible behavior.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, Canon 2, Sections 1 & 2:** Judges must ensure their conduct is above reproach and reaffirms public faith in the integrity of the judiciary.
*   **Canon 4, Sections 2 & 6:** Judges must accept personal restrictions, conduct themselves with dignity, and preserve the dignity of the judicial office when exercising their freedom of expression.
*   **Canon 6, Section 6:** Judges should be dignified and courteous.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Gross Misconduct:** Classified as a serious offense under Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Penalty Imposed:** P40,000 fine. Prior offense of violating Circular No. 1-90.
*   The court referenced Sec. 11(A) of Rule 140, noting that a heavier penalty may be imposed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Malicious Imputation":** Judge Canda argued his derogatory descriptions were "formal accusations," not "malicious imputations." The Court rejected this argument.
*   **Causation of Publication:** While Judge Canda claimed the publication of the letter in the Mindanao Observer was a "journalistic endeavor" beyond his control, the Court found he facilitated it by providing the letter to the desk editor.
*   **Indecent Text Messages:** The allegation of sending indecent text messages was deemed unsubstantiated.
*   **Legal Fees:** Allegation of failing to pay legal fees were unsubstantiated.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Dagudag v. Paderanga*, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2017 (2008): Emphasizes the need for judges to be temperate in their language and conduct.
*   *Juan de la Cruz v. Carretas*, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2043 (2007): Highlights the virtue of gravitas and self-restraint expected of judges.
*   *Re: Anonymous Complaint... against Judge Gedorio*, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1955 (2007): Underscores the importance of judges conducting themselves irreproachably.
*   *Barbarona v. Judge Canda*, 409 Phil. 1 (2001): Recalls Judge Canda's previous disciplinary action, setting the stage for a more severe penalty in the current case.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140:** Governs disciplinary proceedings against judges.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary:**  Sets the ethical standards for judges.

**Legal Precision Points:**

*   The Court emphasized that judges must avoid even the *impression* of impropriety.
*   The standard of proof in administrative proceedings is *substantial evidence*.
*   The imposition of a higher penalty was justified by Judge Canda's repeat offense.
