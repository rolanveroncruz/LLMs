## Legal Document Summary: Co v. Rosario, G.R. No. 160671 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) revocation of the appointment of a special co-administrator of an estate.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in revoking the appointment of Alvin Milton Co as special co-administrator.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Discretionary Power of the Court:** The SC reiterated that the appointment and removal of special administrators are matters within the sound discretion of the court (citing *Heirs of Belinda Dahlia A. Castillo v. Lacuata-Gabriel*, G.R. No. 162934 (2005); *Roxas v. Pecson*, 82 Phil. 407 (1948); *Rivera v. Hon. Santos*, 124 Phil. 1557 (1966); *Alcasid v. Samson*, 102 Phil. 735 (1957)). This discretion is not solely governed by the rules for regular administrators (citing Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium).
*   **Grounds for Removal:** Courts can remove special administrators on grounds other than those explicitly enumerated in the Rules of Court (citing Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium).
*   **Fiduciary Duty:** The RTC's decision was based on Alvin Co's compromised ability to discharge his fiduciary duty as special co-administrator due to pending criminal charges against him for falsification of commercial documents. The RTC reasonably questioned his suitability to handle the estate with the necessary fidelity, trust, and confidence.
*   **Abuse of Discretion Standard:** The SC emphasized that its intervention requires a showing of patent and gross capriciousness, pure whim and abuse, arbitrariness, or despotism in the RTC's decision (citing *Machica v. Roosevelt Services Center, Inc.*, G.R. No. 168664 (2006)). The court found no such abuse.
*   **Officer of the Court:** A special administrator is an officer of the court subject to its supervision and control (citing *Heirs of Belinda Dahlia A. Castillo v. Lacuata-Gabriel*, G.R. No. 162934 (2005)).
* **Ordered to appoint regular administrator:** The SC urges the trial court to appoint a regular administrator as soon as possible

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   While the SC upheld the broad discretion of the trial court, it also emphasized that this discretion must be exercised based on reason, equity, justice, and legal principles (citing *Fule v. Court of Appeals*, 165 Phil. 785 (1976)). This creates a potential for challenges based on assertions that the court's discretion was exercised improperly or based on bias, albeit a difficult burden.
*   The decision might be used by other heirs to bring up criminal charges against the appointed administrator.
