**Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Petitions for Adoption of Michelle P. Lim and Michael Jude P. Lim, G.R. Nos. 168992-93***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Regional Trial Court Decision dismissing petitions for adoption.

**Facts:** Monina P. Lim ("Petitioner"), after the death of her first husband (Primo Lim) and remarriage to Angel Olario, filed separate petitions to adopt Michelle P. Lim and Michael Jude P. Lim, children entrusted to her and her deceased husband as infants. The children's births were previously simulated. At the time of filing, Michelle was 25 and married, and Michael was 18. Both children consented to the adoption, as did Petitioner's current husband, Angel Olario. DSWD certified both children as abandoned with unknown parents.

**Trial Court Ruling:** Dismissed the adoption petitions because Petitioner remarried and failed to jointly file the petition with her husband, citing Sec. 7(c), Art. III of RA 8552 (Domestic Adoption Act of 1998) and Art. 185 of the Family Code.

**Issue:** Can a remarried individual singly adopt children under RA 8552?

**Supreme Court Ruling:**  No. The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, Liabilities, and Risks:**

*   **RA 8552, Section 7(c) - Joint Adoption:** Mandates joint adoption by husband and wife, unless specific exceptions apply (adoption of spouse's legitimate child, adoption of one's own illegitimate child with spousal consent, or legal separation). The Court emphasized that **shall** implies mandatory compliance.
*   **RA 8552, Section 7 - Alien Adopter Qualifications:** Outlines requirements for alien adopters, including diplomatic relations, residency, certification of adoption legality in their country, and allowance for the adoptee's entry into the adopter's country. These requirements were not met by the current spouse.
*   **Article V of RA 8552:** Specifies the legal effects of adoption, which include severing ties with biological parents (except in step-parent adoption), conferring legitimacy on the adoptee, and creating reciprocal rights of succession.
*   **Reciprocal Rights and Obligations** - even with adult adoptees (post-emancipation) the effects of legal adoption continue (legitimacy, inheritance, support if needed).
*   **Risk:** Failure to comply with mandatory joint adoption provisions renders the adoption invalid.  Relying solely on spousal consent (via affidavit) is insufficient, particularly with alien spouses, because of the specific statutory requirements.  The existence of a pending divorce case does not negate the requirement for joint adoption until a final decree of dissolution is issued.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8552 (Domestic Adoption Act of 1998):** The cornerstone of the Court's decision, particularly Section 7 regarding who may adopt and the exceptions to joint adoption.
*   **Family Code:** Referenced in connection with parental authority and the definition of legitimacy.
*   **Republic v. Toledano, G.R. No. 94147, 8 June 1994, 233 SCRA 9:** Cited for the concept of harmony between the spouses.
*   **Republic Act No. 6809:** Referenced for the age of emancipation.
*   **Republic v. Vergara, 336 Phil. 944 (1997):** Reiteration that adoption statutes should be construed liberally, but the Court cannot legislate if the law is clear.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Arguments (Although Unsuccessful):**

*   **Waiver of Joint Adoption:** Petitioner argued that because the adoptees were adults, joint parental authority was unnecessary. The Court rejected this, emphasizing that adoption creates legitimacy and reciprocal rights beyond just parental authority.
*   **Husband's Consent:** Petitioner asserted that her husband's consent sufficed, but the Court held that compliance with RA 8552's alien adopter requirements was mandatory.
*   **Change in Circumstances:** Petitioner argued that a pending divorce action made joint adoption impossible. The Court held that until a final decree is issued, the marriage subsists, and the joint adoption requirement remains.

**Conclusion:**

The decision highlights the strict construction of RA 8552 regarding joint adoption, particularly where a remarried individual is seeking to adopt. The failure to comply with the mandatory requirements for joint adoption, especially the qualifications for an alien adopter, is fatal to the petition. The Court emphasized that it cannot legislate to accommodate individual circumstances, even in adoption cases where the welfare of the child is paramount. This case underscores the need for meticulous compliance with adoption laws.
