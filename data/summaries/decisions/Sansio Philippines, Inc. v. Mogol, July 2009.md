**Legal Document Summary: *Sansio Philippines, Inc. v. Spouses Mogol***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of respondents' Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and/or Injunction.  The core issue is the validity of summons served on the respondents.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Sansio Philippines, Inc. (petitioner) filed a complaint for Sum of Money and Damages against Spouses Mogol (respondents) in the MeTC of Manila due to unpaid purchase of air-conditioning units and fans.

*   **Service of Summons:** The MeTC process server attempted personal service on the Mogols at MeTC Branch 24 (where they were present for related BP 22 cases). Respondents, on advice of counsel, refused to receive the summons, arguing it should be served at their Lucena City residence. Process server returned the summons "UNSERVED."

*   **MeTC Default Order:** MeTC Branch 25 declared the Mogols in default, reasoning personal service can be anywhere the defendant is found per Rule 14, Section 6, and that their refusal to receive was equivalent to valid service.

*   **RTC Upholds MeTC:** RTC Manila dismissed the Mogols' petition questioning the MeTC's default order, agreeing personal service was valid.

*   **CA Reverses:** CA reversed, stating there was no valid service as the Mogols never "received" the summons, and the Return of Service stated "UNSERVED."  The CA found that no further efforts were made to serve the summons.

*   **Subsequent Events:**  The MeTC rendered a decision in favor of Sansio.  The RTC affirmed this decision on appeal and the Mogol's did not appeal beyond the RTC decision.

**Legal Issues:**

1.  **Validity of Service:** Was service in the courtroom valid under Rule 14, Section 6?
2.  **Interpretation of "Tendering":** Does "tendering" under Rule 14, Section 6 require leaving the summons at the premises?
3.  **Duty to Re-Serve:** When a defendant refuses summons on advice of counsel, must the summons be served anew?
4.  **Binding Effect of Process Server's Conclusion:** Is the court bound by the process server's conclusion in the Return of Service?
5.  **Mootness:** Did the RTC's decision on the merits (and subsequent finality) render the CA appeal moot?

**Holding/Decision:**

The Supreme Court *grants* Sansio's petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the RTC's dismissal of the Mogols' petition. The Court holds that valid personal service *did* occur when the summons was presented to the Mogols and their counsel read it on their behalf, constituting "handing" as per Rule 14, Section 6.  The Court stated that the key issue is not the refusal to sign for the summons. Subsequent refusal and the "UNSERVED" statement in the return are immaterial.  The Court criticized the counsel's advice to refuse service as a delaying tactic.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7 of the Rules of Court:**  Central to the dispute concerning personal vs. substituted service.  *Lazaro v. Rural Bank of Francisco Balagtas (Bulacan), Inc.* [456 Phil. 414, 424 (2003)] highlights that personal service does not require the summons to be served at the defendant's residence.

*   **Spouses Madrigal v. Court of Appeals [G.R. No. 129955, 26 November 1999]:**  Regarding the evidentiary value of the sheriff's/process server's certificate of service and presumption of regularity.

*   **Due Process Requirements:** The court emphasizes that the essential requirement of due process is notice reasonably expected to apprise the defendant of the action.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent Spouses Mogol:**  Liability for the debt owed to Sansio Philippines, Inc. (P87,953.12 with legal interest, attorney's fees, and costs of suit) is reaffirmed by the upholding of the MeTC judgment. There is no remaining legal recourse available to the Mogols since the case has been decided.

*   **Process Server Error:** Inadvertent error in the return can cause confusion and delay, but if facts show proper service then the judgment will be valid.

*   **Legal Strategy:** The Court views the Respondent counsel's actions as a possible delay tactic, opening the potential for ethical considerations and scrutiny of the overall approach.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The statement of the process server stating "UNSERVED" in the return on service of summons.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case clarifies the application of Rule 14, Section 6 regarding personal service of summons.  It emphasizes that actual *notice* is the crucial element, and that defendants cannot avoid jurisdiction by merely refusing to sign for or receive the summons after it has been presented to them and its nature is known. The presumption of regularity of official functions of the process server weighed heavily in the Supreme Court's decision. This case is of high precedential value regarding valid summons and can be cited to validate summons that are returned as unserved but where there is reasonable certainty that the defendant knows of the summons.
