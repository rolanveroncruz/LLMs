## Legal Document Summary: People v. XXX, G.R. No. 226467

**Nature:** Appeal assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC conviction of the accused-appellant, XXX, for Statutory Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 (a) and (d) of RA 8353 in relation to RA 7610.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC and CA erred in convicting XXX of Statutory Rape, specifically considering the discrepancy in the date of the alleged incident.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court partially grants the appeal, modifying the conviction from Statutory Rape to Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Accusation:** Information charges XXX with Statutory Rape for an incident in July 2003, alleging sexual intercourse with his 10-year-old daughter, AAA.
*   **Proof of Statutory Rape:** Requires proving the victim's age, the accused's identity, and sexual intercourse. Force/Intimidation is irrelevant due to victim's age.
*   **Defense:** XXX admits to sexual intercourse with AAA, but claims it occurred in 2007 and was consensual.
*   **Variance Doctrine:** Invoked under Section 4, Rule 120, allowing conviction for a lesser included offense.
*   **Conviction for Acts of Lasciviousness:** Elements are: (1) act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) done under specified circumstances, including when the offended party is under 12 years of age.
*   **Damages:** Awarded to the victim with specific monetary amounts and imposed interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** XXX is held liable for Acts of Lasciviousness.
*   **Monetary Liability:** XXX is liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Date Discrepancy:** The discrepancy between the alleged date of the rape (July 2003) and the defense's claim (2007) is crucial. The court highlights the potential violation of due process by relying on facts outside the timeframe specified in the Information.
*   **Due Process Concerns:**  The court notes that conviction for an act outside the scope of the information would offend the accused's due process rights to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation.
*   **Limited Scope:**  The court makes no judgement concerning alleged acts committed in 2007. Records forwarded to DOJ to assess further prosecution concerning these admitted acts.
*   **Prosecutorial Error:** The Court criticizes the prosecution for failing to properly establish the elements of statutory rape and for inadequately questioning the victim during trial.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A, RPC (as amended by RA 8353):** Rape.
*   **RA 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
*   **Article 336, RPC:** Acts of Lasciviousness.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Section 9:** Requirements for valid information.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 120, Sections 4 & 5:** Variance doctrine.
*   **People v. Manaligod, G.R. No. 218584, April 25, 2018:** Statutory Rape elements.
*   **People v. Caoili, G.R. Nos. 196342 & 196848, August 8, 2017:** Guidelines for designating proper offense in cases of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.
*   **People v. Poras, 626 Phil. 526 (2010):** Acts of lasciviousness is necessarily included in a complaint for rape.
*   **People v. Lumibao, 465 Phil. 771, 780 (2004).** Guiding Principles in reviewing rape cases.
*   **People v. Jugueta, [783 Phil. 806 (2016)].** Amount of damages in attempted qualified rape cases, applied by analogy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity centers around the date of the alleged rape. The prosecution based its case on an incident in July 2003. The court heavily relies on the discrepancies to support its reversal.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The accused was initially convicted of Statutory Rape, but the Supreme Court overturned this due to a significant date discrepancy. The prosecution alleged the crime occurred in July 2003, when the victim was 10. However, the evidence presented did not conclusively prove sexual intercourse occurred on that date. The court invoked the variance doctrine and convicted the accused of the lesser included offense of Acts of Lasciviousness under RA 7610 because the evidence *did* show an act of lasciviousness against a minor (putting the victim's hand on the accused's penis). Key issues for future consideration: the impact of the date discrepancy on due process, potential prosecutorial errors, and the possibility of prosecuting the alleged 2007 incident. Further action is recommended at the DOJ.
