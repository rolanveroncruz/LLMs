**Case Summary: *Dela Cruz v. Dimaano*, A.C. No. 7781 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Disbarment proceeding against Atty. Jose R. Dimaano, Jr. for violation of the Notarial Law and making untruthful statements in the acknowledgment of an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Factual Background:** Atty. Dimaano notarized a document purporting to be an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights, allegedly executed by the complainants (Dela Cruz, et al.) and their sister, Navarro. Complainants claim their signatures were forged, they did not appear before Dimaano, and the community tax certificates indicated were not theirs.
*   **Respondent's Admission:** Dimaano admitted preparing and notarizing the document. He claimed reliance on Navarro's representation that the signatures and community tax certificates were genuine, citing a long-standing neighborly relationship.
*   **IBP Findings:** The IBP found that the complainants did not appear before Dimaano, and he notarized the document solely based on Navarro's assurance without verifying the authenticity of the signatures.
*   **Violation of Notarial Law:** Dimaano violated the Notarial Law by falsely stating in the acknowledgment that the complainants "personally came and appeared before him" and that they acknowledged the document as their free act and deed. This misrepresentation allowed Navarro to allegedly assume full ownership of the estate property.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty of Notary Public:** Notaries public have a duty to verify the identity of individuals appearing before them and ensure the genuineness of their signatures (P.A. No. 2103, Sec. 1; 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Sec. 12). Failure to do so constitutes a breach of professional responsibility.
*   **Liability for False Acknowledgment:** A notary public is liable for making false statements in the acknowledgment, which undermines the integrity of the notarized document (citing *Gonzales v. Ramos*, A.C. No. 6649 (2005)).
*   **Standard of Care:** Lawyers acting as notaries public must discharge their duties with fidelity and are held to a high standard of care due to the public interest involved in notarization.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** Dimaano's reliance on Navarro's representations was deemed insufficient and did not excuse his failure to verify the signatures independently. The case clarifies that "good faith" based solely on personal relationships is not a valid defense against improper notarization.
*   **Ambiguity:** while not explicitly stated, the document benefitted one heir over others which should have put the lawyer on notice.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Public Act No. 2103 (Notarial Law):** Sets forth the requirements for acknowledgment and certification by notaries public.
*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Sec. 12:** Defines "competent evidence of identity" and the required forms of identification for notarization.
*   ***Gonzales v. Ramos*, A.C. No. 6649 (2005):** Cited as precedent for the appropriate penalty for violating the Notarial Law.
*   ***Domingo v. Reed*, G.R. No. 157701 (2005):** Highlights the importance of the personal appearance of individuals before the notary to verify signatures.

**Disposition:**

The Supreme Court adopted the IBP's recommendation. Atty. Dimaano's notarial commission was revoked, he was disqualified from reappointment as a notary public for two years, and he was suspended from the practice of law for one year.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the stringent duties of notaries public and emphasizes the consequences of failing to properly verify the identity of individuals and the authenticity of their signatures before notarizing documents. It serves as a warning that reliance on representations, even from trusted individuals, is not sufficient to excuse a breach of the Notarial Law.
