## Legal Document Summary: *American Express International, Inc. vs. Hon. Judge Marlene Gonzales Sison and Maria Teresa Fernando* (G.R. No. 172901)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of American Express International, Inc.'s (Amex) Notice of Appeal.

**Key Issue:** Whether Amex perfected its appeal by timely payment of docket fees, despite the RTC not receiving the payment purportedly mailed within the reglementary period.

**Summary:**

*   **Background:** Celia Silang-Cruz sued Maria Teresa Fernando for unpaid charges on a supplementary Amex card. Fernando filed a third-party complaint against Mandarin Hotel, Amex, and Rodriguez. The RTC ruled in favor of Fernando, awarding substantial damages against Cruz, Mandarin, Amex, and Rodriguez.

*   **Amex's Appeal:** Amex filed a Notice of Appeal but the RTC denied it, finding that Amex failed to pay the appeal docket fees within the prescribed period. Amex claims it sent payment via registered mail within the deadline.

*   **CA Ruling:** The CA upheld the RTC's decision, finding that Amex failed to prove timely payment of docket fees as the Office of the Clerk of Court (OCC) did not receive the payment. Amex didn't provide sufficient proof of mailing and receipt, as per Rule 13, Section 12 of the Rules of Court.

*   **SC Ruling:** Affirms the CA ruling, DENYING Amex's petition. The Supreme Court emphasizes that the right to appeal is statutory and strict compliance with procedural rules is required. Failure to pay docket fees on time is generally fatal to an appeal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 41, Sec. 4, Rules of Court:** Mandates payment of appellate court docket fees within the appeal period. Failure warrants dismissal of appeal.
*   **Rule 13, Sec. 12, Rules of Court:** Specifies acceptable proof of filing/payment via mail. Requires registry receipt *and* affidavit of the mailing person with specific details.
*   **Amex's Obligation:** To prove timely payment of docket fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Amex is liable for damages awarded to Fernando by the RTC, as the RTC decision has become final and executory with respect to Amex.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** The RTC decision against Amex is now final and executory, and the company must pay the assessed damages.
*   **Damages:** These damages include moral and exemplary damages, plus attorney's fees, potentially resulting in a significant financial burden.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rules 13, 41, and 45:** Governing pleading filings, appeals from RTC to CA, and appeals to the Supreme Court, respectively.
*   **_Buenaflor v. Court of Appeals_, 400 Phil. 395 (2000):** Discusses the discretionary nature of dismissing an appeal due to non-payment of docket fees, but distinguishes it from the present case where there was no evidence of payment sent and/or received.
*   **_M.A. Santander Construction, Inc. v. Villanueva_, G.R. No. 136477, November 10, 2004, 441 SCRA 525, 528**: Reiterates that the right to appeal is statutory and must be strictly complied with.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity hinges on whether sending the payment via registered mail, even if not received, constitutes sufficient compliance with the payment requirement. The Court found it did not, particularly in light of insufficient evidence submitted as outlined by Rule 13.
*   While _Buenaflor_ allows for discretionary dismissal based on equity, the absence of even *receipt* of payment distinguishes this case.

**For the Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules, especially regarding the payment of docket fees. Amex's failure to provide sufficient proof of payment, as required by the Rules of Court, proved fatal to its appeal. The case reaffirms that the burden of proof lies with the appellant to demonstrate timely payment and that the court will not liberally construe the rules in the absence of compelling reasons. This serves as a caution against relying solely on registered mail without ensuring proper documentation and compliance with the rules. Further examination of Mandarin's appeal may be warranted, as the CA has noted that the trial court cannot execute its decision with respect to the judgment against Amex pending Mandarin's appeal. This could present a future legal challenge to consider.
