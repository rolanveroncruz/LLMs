Here's a legal summary of the provided decision in *Bio Quest Marketing Inc. v. Edmund Rey* (G.R. No. 181503, Sept. 18, 2009):

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Bio Quest Marketing Inc. (Petitioner) illegally dismissed Edmund Rey (Respondent) due to a failed retrenchment defense under Art. 283 of the Labor Code. The Court held the petitioner failed to meet the evidentiary burden to prove actual or imminent serious business losses, or that retrenchment was a measure of last resort after other less drastic alternatives proved inadequate.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 283, Labor Code:** Justifies termination of employment for retrenchment to prevent losses. The employer must serve written notice to the employee and the DOLE one month prior to termination. Separation pay is required.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The employer bears the burden to prove the retrenchment was justified.
*   **Retrenchment Requirements:**  To justify retrenchment, the employer must prove (1) it is reasonably necessary to prevent substantial losses, (2) written notice was served to both employee and DOLE at least one month prior, (3) separation pay is paid, (4) the employer acted in good faith for its interests, and (5) fair and reasonable criteria were used to select employees to be retrenched. (Citing *Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.*)
*   **Reinstatement/Separation Pay & Backwages:**  The ruling orders reinstatement of the employee, or separation pay if reinstatement is impossible, plus backwages, and the 13th month pay.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  Petitioner is liable for illegal dismissal.
*   **Monetary Awards:**  Petitioner must pay reinstatement with full backwages from dismissal until reinstatement (or separation pay if reinstatement is impossible), plus 13th month pay.
*   **Costs:** Petitioner must pay the cost.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Losses:**  The core issue is the adequacy of Petitioner's proof of losses.  The Court found the sales and collections report insufficient, as decreasing gross revenues, alone, do not justify retrenchment. Self-serving documents (unsigned by a CPA or not independently audited) are considered unreliable.
*   **Last Resort:**  Petitioner failed to prove retrenchment was a last resort. The court emphasized other measures should have been tried and failed before retrenchment was implemented (citing *Polymart Paper Industries, Inc. v. NLRC*). Failure to attempt other cost-cutting measures before termination is a potential fatal flaw in a retrenchment defense.
*   **Reinstatement Impracticability:** The determination of whether reinstatement is "no longer possible" will be a critical point for compliance. If reinstatement is impossible, the employer must pay separation pay.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.:** Set of requirements to justify retrenchment.
*   **Polymart Paper Industries, Inc. v. NLRC:** Retrenchment should only be resorted to after less drastic measures have been tried and found to be inadequate.
*   **Clarion Printing House, Inc. v. NLRC:** Sliding incomes or decreasing gross revenues alone do not necessarily indicate business losses within the meaning of Article 283.
*   **Oriental Petroleum and Minerals Corp. v. Fuentes, et al.:** Emphasizing the need for substantial and continuing losses with no immediate prospect of abating.

**Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of backwages:**  Remand to the Labor Arbiter for computation leaves room for dispute regarding the precise amount owed.
