**Legal Document Summary**

**Case:** Re: Report of Judge Maria Elisa Sempio Diy, A.M. No. 04-8-198-MeTC

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** January 31, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Administrative liability of Clerk of Court Celestina D. Rota for loss of a firearm (evidence in a criminal case) and a cellular phone within court premises.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Custody of Exhibits:** Clerks of Court are responsible for the control and management of court records, exhibits, documents, properties, and supplies. (*Vol. I, The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court 620 (2002)*)
*   **Duty of Care:** Clerks of court must perform their duties with diligence and competence to uphold the judiciary's integrity. (*Reyes-Domingo v. Morales, A.M. No. P-99-1285*)
*   **Non-Adjudicative Functions:** Handling of case exhibits is a non-adjudicative function of the clerk of court.
*   **Statutory Penalty:** Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 99-1936 (1999) Rule IV, Section 52 B(1) outlines penalties for neglect of duty.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** Rota found guilty of simple neglect of duty for failing to properly safeguard the firearm. This arose from her refusal to accept custody of the gun from the clerk assigned for criminal cases, as well as her failure to put it somewhere safe with a functional lock.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The subsequent recovery of the firearm mitigated the penalty.
*   **Humanitarian Considerations:** The Court considered humanitarian reasons to impose a penalty less severe than dismissal, despite this being Rota's second offense.
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Cellular Phone:** Lack of interest and presence of the supposed owner (Zamora) led to the decision of taking no further action.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Re: Loss of Court Exhibits at RTC, Br. 136, Makati City, A.M. No. 93-9-1237-RTC:** Clerks cannot slacken on their jobs due to their vital role in the court.
*   **Arevalo v. Loria, A.M. No. P-02-1600:** Highlights prior instances where Rota has been found negligent.
*   **Seangio v. Parce, A.M. No. P-06-2252:** The court balances disciplinary action with mercy.

**Conclusion:**

Rota was found guilty of simple neglect of duty and suspended for three months without pay.  The Court tempered the prescribed penalty of dismissal with mercy due to the gun's recovery and humanitarian considerations. This case emphasizes the clerks of court's responsibility for safeguarding court exhibits and the importance of diligence in their duties.
