## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Reyes y Paulina*, G.R. No. 225736

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Alglen Reyes y Paulina for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically for the illegal sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Reyes was charged with selling "shabu" without authority, contrary to Section 5, Article II, of RA 9165.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Apprehending officers conducted a buy-bust operation based on an informant's tip. Poseur-buyer exchanged marked money for a sachet of "shabu" from Reyes. Subsequent frisking yielded additional sachets.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Alleged procedures were followed: marking, confiscation receipt, laboratory examination, and presentation in court. Forensic Chemist testified to the identity of the substance.
*   **Defense:** Reyes claimed he was refueling his motorcycle when apprehended and denied possession, alleging the planted evidence.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:** To prove all elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs (identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment) beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 regarding inventory and photographing of seized items in the presence of the accused, an elected public official, a representative from the media, and a representative from the DOJ.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC:** Erred in convicting Reyes based on a defective information and failure to demonstrate adequate compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC conviction, relying on the presumption of regularity and a flawed interpretation of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21 requirements.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defective Information:** The Supreme Court highlights that the Information lacked specifics, omitting the buyer's identity, the quantity of drugs, and the consideration. Cites *People v. Posada*, 684 Phil. 20 (2012) as precedence where Information failed to identify the corpus delicti.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The prosecution failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165, specifically the immediate inventory and photographing of the seized items in the presence of all mandatory witnesses (elected official, media rep, DOJ rep).
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:** The prosecution failed to acknowledge or justify the absence of the mandatory witnesses or to provide any valid reason for non-compliance. This failure undermined the integrity of the chain of custody and the evidentiary value of the seized items. Cites *People v. Tomawis* and *People v. Umipang*, emphasizing the essential purpose of the witness requirements.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The lower courts' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties was insufficient to overcome the documented procedural lapses.
* **Reference to R.A. No. 6425** This reference shows the possibility of abuse that exists within anti-narcotics operation, especially, the possibility that the prosecution evidence may have been planted or contaminated.
**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Section 5 (Illegal Sale), Section 21 (Chain of Custody)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 110, Sections 8 & 9 (Sufficiency of Information)
*   **People v. Posada, 684 Phil. 20 (2012):** Defective Information lacking specific details of the *corpus delicti*.
*   **People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018:** Emphasizes importance of mandatory witnesses to protect against planting or contamination.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):** Insufficient effort to secure required witnesses.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018:** Lists acceptable excuses for lack of mandatory witnesses
*   **People v. Reyes, 797 Phil. 671 (2016):** Requirement for prosecution to acknowledge and justify procedural lapses.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted Reyes due to the defective Information and the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody, violating Section 21 of RA 9165.
