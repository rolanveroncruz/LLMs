## Legal Document Summary: *Tan vs. Republic (Bureau of Customs)*, G.R. No. 216756

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision reinstating Bureau of Customs' (BOC) claim against Genoveva Tan (substituted by Melchor Tan) for recovery of funds due to the alleged use of spurious Tax Credit Certificates (TCCs) by Mannequin International Corp.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **BOC's Claim:** BOC seeks to recover P55,664,027.00 from Mannequin, and subsequently, Tan as a corporate officer, based on alleged fraudulent use of TCCs.
*   **Tan's Argument:** Tan argues she was no longer connected with Mannequin when the fraudulent acts occurred, presenting documents indicating transfer of shares. She filed a Motion to Exclude herself from the case.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The RTC granted Tan's Motion to Exclude.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA reversed the RTC decision, finding grave abuse of discretion. It held that the RTC erred in relying solely on the presumption of regularity of public documents presented by Tan, and that BOC had presented sufficient evidence (testimony and documentary inconsistencies) to overcome this presumption. The CA reinstated the Writ of Preliminary Attachment against Tan's properties.
*   **SC Ruling:** SC denied the Petition, adopting CA’s decision in toto. SC also holds that BOC’s case against Tan survives even after her death, as it is an action to recover damages for an injury to the State under Rule 87, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability for Tan's Estate:** Tan's estate remains potentially liable for the sum of money sought by BOC if found responsible for Mannequin's fraudulent actions.
*   **Liability as Corporate Officer:** The key issue revolves around whether Tan can be held personally liable for the corporate obligations of Mannequin. The CA suggests her direct involvement ("principal orchestrator") may warrant piercing the corporate veil.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **"Piercing the Corporate Veil":** The central risk is the possibility of the court piercing the corporate veil and holding Tan (or her estate) directly liable for the company's debt. The evidence presented by the BOC aimed to overcome the defense of limited liability. SC affirms that there is documentary evidence which points to Genoveva’s significant participation in Mannequin’s affairs during the time material to the suit.
*   **Ambiguity in Share Transfer Documents:** The CA points to questionable timing and inconsistencies in the documents purporting to show Tan's divestment from Mannequin. The SC affirmed the CA ruling, stating the public documents revealed palpable inconsistencies that warrants a scrutiny of said documents and Tan’s participation in the company’s affairs. The failure to immediately report the change in board composition to SEC also casts suspicion.
*   **Procedural Issue (Filing of Certiorari):** Petitioner argued that the BOC's petition for certiorari was filed out of time, and as such, the lower court ruling should have been upheld. SC ruled that petitioner has waived its right to question propriety of the reinstatement of the BOC’s Petition for Certiorari by actively participating in the process after the CA reinstated the case.
*   **Representation by Counsel:** The CA addressed the argument that Tan was not properly represented by counsel. It found that Atty. Reyes-Eleazar was properly representing Tan, thus rendering the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Atty. Simbillo as moot.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 87, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Defines actions that survive against a decedent's estate.
*   **Rule 65, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Governs the filing period for petitions for certiorari (and amendments thereto by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC).
*   **Jurisdiction by Estoppel:** Marquez v. Secretary of Labor (253 Phil. 329, 336 (1989)) - Supports the concept that active participation in proceedings waives the right to later challenge jurisdiction.
*   **Director’s Certificate and Assignment of Shares:** The court heavily relied on the Director’s Certificate and Assignment of Shares to question Tan’s Motion to Exclude.
*   **Logronio v. Taleseo, 370 Phil. 907, 910 (1999)** Supports the general rule of procedure that courts can take cognizance only of the issues pleaded by the parties.

**Recommendations for Lawyer:**

*   Thoroughly examine the documentary evidence related to Tan's alleged share transfer.
*   Assess the strength of the BOC's evidence suggesting Tan's personal involvement in the fraudulent scheme, and whether it meets the threshold for piercing the corporate veil.
*   Prepare a defense strategy focused on refuting the allegations of direct involvement, or proving that the Estate should not be held liable.
*   Review the timeline of filings and counsel representation to fully assess procedural defenses, and determine whether a Motion for Reconsideration before the Supreme Court is warranted.
