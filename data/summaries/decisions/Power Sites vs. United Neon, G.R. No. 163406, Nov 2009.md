**Case Summary: Power Sites and Signs, Inc. vs. United Neon**

**Citation:** 620 Phil. 205 (G.R. No. 163406, November 24, 2009)

**Legal Issue:** Propriety of a preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the RTC ordering United Neon to dismantle its billboard.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision nullifying the RTC's preliminary mandatory injunction. The Court found that Power Sites failed to demonstrate a clear right to the relief sought and that the alleged injury was not grave and irreparable.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Preliminary Injunction Requirements:** The Court reiterates the standard for granting injunctive relief (citing *Golding v. Balatbat, 36 Phil. 941 (1917)*): (1) entitlement to relief; (2) actual or threatened violation of rights; (3) probability of irreparable injury; and (4) inadequacy of pecuniary compensation. These are codified under Rule 58 of the Rules of Court

*   **Mandatory Injunction Standard:** Higher standard for preliminary mandatory injunctions. Requires extreme urgency, clear right, significant relative inconvenience in the applicant's favor, willful and unlawful invasion of the applicant's right, and maintenance of a pre-existing relationship. (*Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company v. Del Rosario, 22 Phil. 433 (1912)*)

*   **OAAP Code of Ethics/Guidelines:** Reference to the Outdoor Advertising Association of the Philippines (OAAP) Code of Ethics/Guidelines, specifically regarding registration of lease agreements to secure exclusive rights to line-of-sight. (Arts. 11, Sec. 3.6 & 3.7)

*   **Irreparable Injury:** The Court defines "irreparable injury" as an injury where there is no standard to measure its amount with reasonable accuracy, and not merely quantifiable damages. (*Social Security Commission v. Bayona, 115 Phil. 105 (1962)*)

*   **National Building Code:** reference to compliance with code of ethics for advertising and promotions

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Clear Right:** Power Sites' claim to exclusive right to the line of sight was heavily contested. Both parties claimed priority in construction, which created a factual dispute that needed to be resolved in trial. Also, the permits were granted to HCLC Resources and Development Corporation and Mr. Renato Reyes So, not to Power Sites.

*   **Quantifiable Damages:** The alleged damages (lost profits, potential client claims, and billboard costs) were quantifiable, negating the "irreparable injury" requirement for injunctive relief.

*   **Corporate Veil:** The Court flagged the issue of Power Sites’ reliance on permits issued to HCLC Resources and Development Corp, noting it "flies in the face of the basic principle in corporation law - that a corporation has a personality separate and distinct from those of its stockholders and other corporations to which it may be connected." This could expose Power Sites to further challenges regarding its standing to sue and ownership of the billboard.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Case Law:**

*   **Priority of Construction:** The factual dispute over which party began construction first. The conflicting claims created a cloud over Power Sites’ right to the claimed line-of-sight.
*   **OAAP Registration:** The validity and applicability of the OAAP Code of Ethics/Guidelines, specifically whether registration with the OAAP grants exclusive line-of-sight rights and its binding effect on non-members.
*   **Procedural Issue:** Discretion of the Court of Appeals in accepting a petition for certiorari with seemingly insufficient documentation. The Supreme Court affirmed that such decision is within the appellate court’s discretion. (Condes v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 161304, July 27, 2007, 528 SCRA 339, 349-350.)

*   **Rule 58, Rules of Court:** Governing preliminary injunctions.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Governing certiorari.
*   **Presidential Decree 1096: National Building Code**

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court's decision emphasizes the strict requirements for granting preliminary injunctive relief, particularly mandatory injunctions. The lack of a clear right and the availability of monetary damages were fatal to Power Sites' application. Furthermore, the corporate structure of HCLC Resources and Power Sites introduces complexities regarding ownership and standing to sue, which the trial court needs to address.
