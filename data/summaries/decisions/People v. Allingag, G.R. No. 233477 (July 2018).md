**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Jowie and Elizabeth Allingag***

**Case:** G.R. No. 233477, July 30, 2018 (Illegal Sale and Possession of Dangerous Drugs)

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted the Appellants, Jowie and Elizabeth Allingag, of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Appellants were charged with:
    *   Violation of Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, 0.13g of methamphetamine hydrochloride)
    *   Violation of Section 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, 0.32g of marijuana by Jowie; 0.13g of methamphetamine hydrochloride by Elizabeth)
*   **Chain of Custody:** The central issue is the integrity of the chain of custody, particularly the failure to comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules.
*   **Missing Witness:** Critical is the lack of a Department of Justice (DOJ) representative during the post-seizure inventory and photography of the drugs.
*   **Justifiable Grounds:** The prosecution failed to provide any justifiable reason for the absence of a DOJ representative. The Court cites *People v. Angelita Reyes, et al., G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018* and *People v. Vicente Sipin y De Castro, G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018* regarding circumstances justifying the absence of required witnesses.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5 and 11:** Defines the offenses of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21:** Prescribes the procedure for handling seized drugs, including inventory and photography in the presence of the accused and representatives from the media and DOJ/elected public official. This provision is the crux of the appeal.
*   **R.A. 10640:** Amendment to R.A. 9165 that amended Sec. 21. However, the old provision of Section 21 and its IRR applied in this case since the crime was committed before the amendment.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. 9165, Section 21(a):** Details the requirements of Sec. 21.
*   **People v. Gatlabayan, 699 Phil. 240, 252 (2011):** Establishes the importance of identifying the dangerous drug beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **People v. Salim Ismael y Radang, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017:** Elements of illegal sale of prohibited drugs and illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Angelita Reyes, et al., G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018:** Enumerates instances where absence of required witnesses may be justified.
*   **People v. Vicente Sipin y De Castro, G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018:** reiterates prosecution must prove justifiable cause for non-compliance.
*   **Legislative Intent (Senate Journal):**  The Court refers to Senate discussions surrounding RA 10640 to illustrate the complexities and practical difficulties in strict compliance with the original Section 21.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018:** Clarifies under varied field conditions that strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 may not always be possible.
*   **Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code:** referred to in *People v. Angelita Reyes, et al.* which pertains to the timely delivery of prisoners.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Obligation to strictly comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 or provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance.
*   **Prosecution:** Burden to prove the chain of custody and justifiable grounds for deviations from established procedures. Failure to do so can result in acquittal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court found that relying on the presumption of regularity in the police officers' performance of duty was misplaced because there was no compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  The absence of a DOJ representative created reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Planting of Evidence:** Without strict adherence to procedures, the risk of planting, tampering, or alteration of evidence increases, especially when small quantities of drugs are involved.
*   **Justifiable Grounds Argument:** It is unclear what, specifically, constitutes "justifiable grounds" and how they should be proven.

**Conclusion:**

The acquittal was based on the prosecution's failure to justify the non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165. The absence of a DOJ representative during the inventory and the lack of explanation for this absence were fatal to the prosecution's case.
