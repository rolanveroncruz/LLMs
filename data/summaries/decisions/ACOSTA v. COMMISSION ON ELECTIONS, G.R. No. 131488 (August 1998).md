## Legal Document Summary: Acosta v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 131488

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing a COMELEC En Banc resolution in SPR No. 13-97 concerning a barangay election protest.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dispute:** Election protest filed by Rivera against Acosta, contesting the results of the Punong Barangay election based on allegations of misreading/mistallying of ballots.
*   **MCTC Decision:** MCTC initially denied Acosta's motion for time to answer and ordered ballot box revision. Subsequently, ruled in favor of Rivera, nullifying Acosta's proclamation.
*   **COMELEC Resolution:** The COMELEC En Banc affirmed the MCTC's May 21 order and May 30 decision.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted Acosta's petition, nullifying the COMELEC En Banc resolution.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **COMELEC:** Duty to hear and decide election cases in division (Art. IX-C, Sec. 3, Constitution).
*   **MCTC:** Proper exercise of jurisdiction over election protests.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The COMELEC exceeded its jurisdiction by affirming the MCTC's decision (subject of an appeal UNDK No. 5-97) in SPR No. 13-97, which only pertained to the MCTC's interlocutory order. The two cases were not consolidated.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Affirming the decision in UNDK No. 5-97 when the parties had not yet submitted any evidence relating to the election protest.
*   **Constitutional Violation:** The COMELEC En Banc decided the case instead of a Division, violating Art. IX-C, Sec. 3 of the Constitution, which requires division decisions with En Banc deciding motions for reconsideration.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. IX-C, Sec. 3 of the Constitution:** Mandates COMELEC to hear election cases in division. Cited in *Sarmiento v. COMELEC*, 212 SCRA 307, 313-14 (1992); *Ong v. COMELEC*, 216 SCRA 806, 812 (1992); *Ong v. COMELEC*, 221 SCRA 475, 482-483 (1993).

Cayetano*, 78 SCRA 485 (1977).

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The entire COMELEC resolution is contentious due to the aforementioned jurisdictional and constitutional violations.
*   The COMELEC's justification for affirming the MCTC decision in the SPR No. 13-97 despite it being the subject of a separate appeal.

**Outcome:**

*   The SC nullified the COMELEC En Banc resolution and remanded the cases (SPR No. 13-97 and UNDK No. 5-97) to a Division of the COMELEC for proper disposition.
