## Legal Document Summary: *National Mines and Allied Workersâ€™ Union (NAMAWU) vs. San Ildefonso College-RVM Sisters Administration*, G.R. No. 125039 (1998)

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari under Rule 65 challenging the NLRC decision dismissing illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice complaints.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Court differentiates between regular (permanent) and non-regular (probationary/part-time) employees. It reiterates the three-year rule from *University of Sto. Tomas v. NLRC* (182 SCRA 371 [1990]), citing the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools, for teachers to attain permanent status. Reinstatement and backwages are standard remedies for illegal dismissal.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice (ULP):** Allegations of ULP, specifically interference with union activities, must be supported by substantial evidence. Coincidence of non-renewal of contracts with union formation is insufficient without proof of anti-union motive.
*   **Minimum Wage/Salary Differentials:** The Court applies the formula under R.A. 6727 and its Implementing Rules for calculating monthly minimum wage, considering actual working days. The Court cites the case of *Philippine Air Lines Employees Association (PALEA) v. Philippine Air Lines, Inc. (PAL)* to support the formula.
*   **Due Process in Termination:** Permanent employees are entitled to substantive (just cause) and procedural due process (two notices) before termination, as per Article 277(b) of the Labor Code.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (San Ildefonso College):** Obligated to observe due process in terminating permanent employees. Liable for reinstatement, back wages, and other benefits for illegally dismissed employees. Must also comply with minimum wage laws.
*   **Employee (NAMAWU et al.):** Burden of proving ULP rests on the employee/union.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fixed-Term Contracts:** While annual renewals can be valid for probationary employees, prolonged renewals may lead to arguments for regularization based on *Sonza vs. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp.* (2004) and other similar cases. The Court's decision in this case did not consider this angle for the probationary teachers.
*   **Part-Time Status:** The Court's finding that Arroyo did not relinquish her permanent status is fact-specific. Future cases involving changes from full-time to part-time employment may raise questions about continuity of tenure and the presence of *just cause* if terminated.
*   **Insufficient Data for Part-Time Employees:** The Labor Arbiter was not able to calculate the amount of salary differentials due to insufficient data. Incomplete documentation can leave gaps in the record.
*   **Good faith compliance is a possible defense.**

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 277(b) and 279 (security of tenure, due process, remedies for illegal dismissal).
*   **R.A. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act):** Minimum wage requirements and computation formulas.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Petition for certiorari.
*   **University of Sto. Tomas v. NLRC (182 SCRA 371 [1990]):** Establishes the three-year rule for teachers in private schools to acquire permanent status.
*   **Philippine Air Lines Employees Association (PALEA) v. Philippine Air Lines, Inc. (PAL):** Computation of basic daily wage for monthly-salaried employees.
*   **Manual of Regulations for Private Schools:** Defines the rights and obligations of teachers and private schools.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools vs. the Labor Code has been a point of contention over the years. The manual is limited to teachers of private schools.
