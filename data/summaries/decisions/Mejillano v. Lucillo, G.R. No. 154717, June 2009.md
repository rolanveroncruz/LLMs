**Case:** *Bonifacio M. Mejillano v. Enrique Lucillo, et al.* G.R. No. 154717, June 19, 2009 (607 Phil. 660)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of an appeal from the MTC in an action for recovery of possession.

**Facts:**
*   Dispute over Lot No. 9014 arising from conflicting claims of inheritance and subsequent sales.
*   Respondent Lucillo acquired ownership through purchase from heirs of Felix and Hospicio Loteri√±a.
*   Petitioner Mejillano occupied the land, claiming ownership through an Extrajudicial Partition and Sale by the heirs of Jesus Lorente.
*   MTC ruled in favor of Lucillo.
*   Mejillano appealed to the RTC but failed to file a required appeal memorandum within the prescribed period.
*   RTC dismissed the appeal. CA affirmed the dismissal.

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision upholding the RTC's dismissal of the appeal, due to the appellant's failure to file the required appeal memorandum within the mandatory period specified in Rule 40, Section 7(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Key Provisions/Rules:**

*   **Rule 40, Section 7(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Mandates the appellant to submit an appeal memorandum within 15 days of notice; failure to do so is grounds for dismissal of the appeal. The court emphasized the mandatory nature of the rule.
*   The Supreme Court cited *Enriquez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 140473, January 28, 2003* holding that the use of "shall" in a statute or rule expresses what is mandatory and compulsory. Further, the Rule imposes upon an appellant the "duty" to submit his memorandum. A duty is a "legal or moral obligation, mandatory act, responsibility, charge, requirement, trust, chore, function, commission, debt, liability, assignment, role, pledge, dictate, office, (and) engagement."
*   The Court also reiterated that procedural rules exist to provide order and efficiency in the judicial system and must generally be followed strictly. The right to appeal is statutory and subject to compliance with the Rules.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant has a mandatory duty to file an appeal memorandum within 15 days of notice.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   Failure to file the appeal memorandum on time results in dismissal of the appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Court rejected arguments based on ignorance, excusable negligence, or substantial justice to excuse non-compliance with the rules of procedure.
*   Arguments that the sale to the private respondent is null and void are not considered since the appeal was dismissed on procedural grounds. The substance of the case was never properly considered in the RTC or CA.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None identified, as the ruling is based on the clear and unambiguous requirements of Rule 40, Section 7(b).
