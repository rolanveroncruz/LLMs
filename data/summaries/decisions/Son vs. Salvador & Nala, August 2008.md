## Legal Document Summary: *Son v. Salvador & Nala*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-08-2466 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 07-2477-P)

**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division

**Date:** August 13, 2008

**Parties:**

*   Complainant: Ben G. Son
*   Respondents: Concepcion B. Salvador (Court Interpreter) & Jose V. Nala, Jr. (Clerk II)

**Subject Matter:** Administrative complaint for violation of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC).

**Summary of Allegations:**

Complainant alleges that respondents abused their positions to influence cases against him in favor of the Torrente family, specifically citing:

1.  Respondent Salvador's (Court Interpreter) visit by Nerrie Torrente-Ungsod regarding legal assistance, implying influence peddling in I.S. No. 05-I-11140-42.
2.  Respondent Salvador and Nala being seen together inside a Branch 141 courtroom where Complainant's case was pending.
3.  Miranda and Saldo overheard someone suggesting a "budget" for following up a case, supposedly ordered by "Ate Connie," identified as Respondent Nala following up with the Branch Clerk.
4.  Respondent Salvador's involvement in "e-load" business and money lending to court employees, implying unethical conduct.

**Respondents' Defense:**

*   Denied allegations, claiming the complaint is based on conjecture and lacks substantial evidence.
*   Salvador admits Nerrie's visit for legal advice but denies fixing cases or influencing Br. 141.
*   Belen et. al (employees of Branch 141) submitted a joint affidavit denying that the respondents interfered with court records.
*   Nala denied the allegations of following up or bribing court personnel.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** The basis of the complaint. Violation implies ethical breaches and potential disciplinary action.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court emphasizes the burden of proof rests on the complainant to substantiate the allegations (citing *Tam v. Regencia*, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1604). The Court found Complainant's testimony weak, relying on conjectures and hearsay.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court invokes the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties (citing *Tam v. Regencia*). This favors the respondents in the absence of convincing evidence of misconduct.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Testimony considered "hardly making a case against respondents" due to subjective interpretations.
*   **OCA Investigation:** The OCA's initial report acknowledged the seriousness of the charges but recommended further investigation due to conflicting versions. This highlights potential concerns about corruption among court personnel, though ultimately unsubstantiated in the Supreme Court's view.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court *DISMISSED* the administrative complaint against Salvador and Nala for failure of complainant to substantiate the charges. A general admonition was issued to all employees to avoid any act giving rise to the suspicion that they are interested in any case pending in court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Concrete Evidence:** The dismissal was primarily due to insufficient evidence. The Court relied on presumptions rather than direct proof of misconduct.
*   **Hearsay Testimony:** The evidence presented was based on hearsay. The court could have been more rigorous on the admissibility of this evidence
*   **Subjective Interpretation:** The interpretation of events by the complainant was deemed subjective, highlighting the need for objective and verifiable evidence in administrative proceedings.

**Relevance to a Lawyer:**

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of:

*   Substantial evidence in administrative cases against court personnel.
*   Overcoming the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
*   Avoidance of speculation and conjecture, and the presentation of factual, verified information.
*   Burden of proof as assigned to the complainant.

The dismissal in this case hinged on the failure to meet the burden of proof and the reliance on circumstantial evidence, ultimately favoring the presumption of regularity.
