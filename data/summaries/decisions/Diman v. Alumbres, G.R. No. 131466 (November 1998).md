Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Diman vs. Alumbres*, G.R. No. 131466, November 27, 1998, focusing on key issues, potential risks, and legal arguments:

**Case Summary: *Diman vs. Alumbres***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the trial court's denial of the Dimans' (petitioners) Motion for Summary Judgment and Demurrer to Evidence in a "Quieting of Title and Damages" case filed by the Lacalle Heirs (respondents).

**Key Issue:** Whether the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the Dimans' Motion for Summary Judgment and Demurrer to Evidence, particularly given the Lacalle Heirs' failure to respond to a Request for Admission under Rule 26 and their failure to present credible evidence of ownership.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and dismissed the Lacalle Heirs' case. The Court held that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in denying the motions.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 26 (Request for Admission):** This case extensively discusses the legal effect of failing to respond to a Request for Admission. The Lacalle Heirs' failure to respond to the Dimans' Request for Admission resulted in implied admissions of the truth of the matters specified in the request. *This is a critical point and a significant risk for parties who fail to diligently respond to discovery requests.*
*   **Rule 34 (Summary Judgment):**  (Now Rule 35 under the 1997 amendments): The Court clarified the distinction between Summary Judgment and Judgment on the Pleadings. A summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings appear to raise issues of fact, but those issues are demonstrably sham, fictitious, or not genuine, as evidenced by admissions, depositions, or affidavits. *The court emphasized that despite the appearance of conflicting claims, a summary judgment is warranted if it's clear no genuine issue exists.*
*   **Rule 35 (Demurrer to Evidence):** (Now Rule 33 under the 1997 amendments): The Court emphasizes the need for the Trial Judge to assess the evidence to ascertain whether or not "upon the facts and the law the plaintiff(s) ** (have) shown no right to relief."

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Implied Admissions:** Failure to respond to a Request for Admission results in implied admission of the facts stated in the request, which can be detrimental to a party's case.
*   **Improper Denial of Summary Judgment/Demurrer:** Protracted litigation and wasted resources can result from a trial court's failure to properly apply the rules on summary judgment and demurrer to evidence.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Ownership:** The Lacalle Heirs' failure to produce a valid title or evidence of ownership was fatal to their claim.
*   **Unregistered Deed:** Reliance on an unregistered deed for registered land creates a high risk, as it cannot affect third parties or bind the land.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court (Rule 26, Rule 34, Rule 35):** The decision heavily relies on and interprets the Rules of Court relating to discovery (particularly Request for Admission), Summary Judgment, and Demurrer to Evidence.
*   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 51 regarding the effect of unregistered instruments on registered land is cited.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 204 SCRA 211:** Cited for the court's observations of "regrettable unfamiliarity and even outright ignorance about the nature, purposes and operation of the modes of discovery, at least a strong yet unreasoned and unreasonable disinclination to resort to them."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolved around the validity of the Lacalle Heirs' title and their ability to prove ownership. The court found the evidence presented by the Heirs as spurious, resulting in the dismissal of the case.

**Potential Legal Arguments & Strategies:**

*   *For parties serving a Request for Admission:* Ensure clear and concise phrasing in the request. If no response is received, vigorously pursue summary judgment or a demurrer to evidence.
*   *For parties receiving a Request for Admission:* Respond promptly and specifically, either admitting, denying, or explaining the inability to admit or deny each request. Failure to do so can result in deemed admissions.
*   *Motions for Summary Judgment:*  Emphasize the lack of a genuine issue of material fact and the opposing party's implied admissions.
*   *Demurrer to Evidence:*  Focus on the plaintiff's failure to present sufficient evidence to establish their claim, especially when implied admissions support the defendant's position.

**In Conclusion:**

*Diman vs. Alumbres* serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding and properly utilizing the rules of discovery and motion practice. It underscores the severe consequences of failing to respond to a Request for Admission, and the need for trial courts to apply the rules on summary judgment and demurrer to evidence to expedite litigation when there is a clear absence of a genuine factual dispute. This case emphasizes the necessity of possessing and presenting credible evidence of ownership, particularly when dealing with registered land.
