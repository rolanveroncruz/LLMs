## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Col. Noel P. Mislang* (G.R. No. 207926)

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on *certiorari* challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the Ombudsman's Joint Decision finding Col. Mislang guilty of Grave Misconduct and dismissing him from service. The CA reversed based on res judicata, arguing that Mislang was acquitted by a General Court Martial (GCM) for the same acts.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Grave Misconduct stemming from allegations of plotting the assassination of a former mayor and involvement in the shooting of soldiers.
*   **Ombudsman's Decision:** Found Mislang guilty of Grave Misconduct and ordered his dismissal.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the Ombudsman's decision based on res judicata due to Mislang's acquittal by a GCM on the same charges. The CA also addressed due process concerns, noting that the CA considered respondent’s assertion that neither copies of the complaint­-affidavits, nor any order from the petitioner to file his counter-affidavits were received by him.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mislang:** Originally found liable by the Ombudsman for Grave Misconduct, subject to dismissal from service. Subsequently, absolved by the CA's reversal.
*   **Ombudsman:** Obligated to conduct investigations with due process and to recognize concurrent jurisdiction with the GCM.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The CA's application of res judicata based on the GCM's acquittal poses a risk of precluding the Ombudsman from pursuing administrative cases against military personnel for the same actions already adjudicated by a military court.
*   **Due Process Violations:** The risk of decisions being overturned if proper due process (notice and opportunity to be heard) is not afforded to the respondent.
*   **Jurisdictional Conflict:** Potential for conflicting decisions between the Ombudsman and the AFP if concurrent jurisdiction is not properly managed.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** Heavy reliance on affidavits of self-confessed killers, without independent corroborating evidence, raises concerns about the substantiality of evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on *certiorari* to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 43, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.
*   **R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):** Defines the powers and functions of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   **C.A. No. 408 (Articles of War) in relation to R.A. No. 7055:** Governs military justice and the jurisdiction of courts-martial.
*   ***Lt. Gonzales v. Gen. Abaya, 530 Phil. 189 (2006)*:**  Discusses the concurrent jurisdiction of the Ombudsman and GCM over service-connected offenses.
*   ***Primo C. Miro v. Maarilyn Mendoza Vda. De Erederos, et al., 721 Phil. 772 (2013)*:** Discusses the weight given to Ombudsman's factual findings, the requirement of substantial evidence, and administrative due process.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) dated January 28, 2004, between AFP and Ombudsman:** Aims to coordinate jurisdiction and avoid conflicting decisions.
*   **Rule of *res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet***: (Things done between strangers ought not to injure those who are not parties to them).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of the MOA:** The MOA's provisions regarding the endorsement of non-graft cases to the AFP is subject to interpretation regarding whether it divests the Ombudsman of jurisdiction or merely provides a mechanism for coordination. The Supreme Court held that the MOA was merely for coordination and did not remove the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** Whether the Ombudsman's decision was supported by substantial evidence, considering the reliance on affidavits of accomplices and the alleged due process violations.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Focus on Concurrent Jurisdiction:** Emphasize the principle of prior jurisdiction. The GCM took cognizance of the case earlier; therefore, Ombudsman should have deferred.
*   **Due Process Argument:** Due process violations by the Ombudsman are a strong defense.
*   **Evidentiary Scrutiny:**  Challenge the weight and admissibility of the evidence presented by the Ombudsman, highlighting the lack of independent corroboration and violation of res inter alios acta.
