Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Premiere Development Bank vs. Alfredo C. Flores, Arizona Transport Corporation, and Panacor Marketing Corporation* G.R. No. 175339, December 16, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's order granting a writ of execution for damages awarded to respondent corporations in a prior Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 159352).

**Facts:**

*   Panacor obtained a credit line, secured by Arizona's property. Premiere Bank refused to release the mortgage documents after IBA-Finance paid off Arizona's loan, causing Panacor damages due to the loss of their Colgate distributorship agreement.  This led to the prior case and the award of damages.
*   Premiere Bank foreclosed on Arizona's property.
*   Premiere Bank opposed the execution of the damage award, claiming it was entitled to compensation/set-off due to a pending case (Civil Case No. MC03-2202) involving a deficiency claim against respondent corporations after the foreclosure.
*   Premiere bank claimed that a separate trial to award the penalties would be iniquitous since the respondent corporations are undergoing a dissolution and the court proceedings will prove an inefficient use of judicial time

**Issue:** Was the RTC correct in granting the writ of execution for the damages awarded in G.R. No. 159352?

**Holding:** Yes. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the grant of the writ of execution.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Final and Executory Judgment:**  The SC emphasized that a final judgment must be executed as a ministerial duty of the court. Exceptions to this rule are not applicable in this case. (Rule 39, Section 1, Rules of Court; *City of Manila v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 100626, 29 November 1991, 204 SCRA 362, 366; *Cruz v. Leabres*, 314 Phil. 26, 34 (1995)).
*   **Compensation/Set-Off (Art. 1278, 1279 Civil Code):** The Court rejected Premiere Bank's argument for compensation/set-off.  A key requirement for compensation is that both debts must be *liquidated and demandable*. Premiere Bank's deficiency claim was merely a claim, not a debt, and the court would be using judicial time inefficiently.
    *   Difference between "debt" and "claim" (*Vallarta v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. L-36543, 27 July 1988, 163 SCRA 587, 594).
*   **Compulsory Counterclaim (Section 7, Rule 6, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure):** Premiere Bank's deficiency claim should have been raised as a compulsory counterclaim in Civil Case No. MC03-2202 in Mandaluyong. The SC reiterated that the existence of a "logical relationship" between the main claim and counterclaim would make it compulsory, this is not the case in this instance.
    *   "Compelling test of compulsoriness" (*Quintanilla v. CA*, 344 Phil. 811 (1997); *Alday v. FGU Insurance Corporation*, 402 Phil. 962 (2001)).
*   **Corporate Dissolution:** The SC found that the involuntary dissolution of the respondent corporations did not bar enforcement of the judgment.  Trustees can manage the affairs of a dissolved corporation in liquidation (Sections 122 & 145, Corporation Code).
    *   *Sumera v. Valencia*, 67 Phil. 721, 726 (1939); *Reburiano v. Court of Appeals*, 361 Phil. 294, 307 (1999).
*   **Consignation:** Premiere Bank's offer to deposit the P800,000 with the RTC was not a valid consignation because it was not preceded by a tender of payment.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Deficiency Claim:** The Court's analysis strongly suggests that Premiere Bank's opportunity to pursue its deficiency claim against respondent corporations has been waived by failing to assert it as a compulsory counterclaim in the earlier Mandaluyong case. This exposes Premiere Bank to a significant financial loss beyond the initial damages.
*   **Factual Basis of Damages in G.R. No. 159352:** While not directly addressed in this case, the underlying factual basis for the award of damages in the prior case should be examined to ensure its ongoing validity.
*   **Winding Up Process:** The potential complications of enforcing a judgment against a corporation in the process of winding up should be considered. While the Court states that it is permissible, there may be practical hurdles.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 1
*   Civil Code, Articles 1278, 1279
*   Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 6, Section 7
*   Corporation Code, Sections 122, 145
