## Legal Document Summary: *C.F. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Santos* (G.R. No. 213731)

This is a *certiorari* appeal from a CA decision reversing the NLRC and reinstating the LA's award of permanent and total disability benefits to seafarer Jowell Santos, who was diagnosed with Diabetes Mellitus II and hypertension. The Supreme Court (**SC**) granted the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the NLRC's decision *with modification* â€“ awarding only partial disability benefits based on the company-designated physician's Grade 12 disability rating, and adding interest.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **POEA-SEC Compliance:** The central issue is whether the POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC) provisions regarding medical assessment and disability benefits were correctly applied.
*   **Disability Determination:** The SC emphasizes that *mere* inability to work for 120 days does not automatically equate to permanent total disability. *Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.* (765 Phil. 341 (2015)) and *Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias* (773 Phil. 428 (2015)) are cited to reiterate that the company-designated physician's timely medical assessment (within 120/240 days) is crucial.
*   **Third Doctor Referral:** The SC notes the seafarer's failure to initiate the third-doctor referral process under Sec. 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC when his own doctor (Dr. Donato-Tan) disagreed with the company-designated physician's assessment. This omission undermines his challenge to the company doctor's findings, relying on *INC Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Rosales* (744 Phil. 774, 785-786 (2014)) and *Bahia Shipping Services, Inc. v. Constantino* (738 Phil. 564 (2014)).
*   **Work-Relatedness and Compensability:** The SC underscores that neither essential hypertension nor diabetes automatically equates to permanent total disability under the POEA-SEC. While essential hypertension is a listed occupational disease (Sec. 32-A), it requires organ impairment resulting in permanent disability, referencing *Manansala v. Marlow Navigation Phils., Inc.* (G.R. No. 208314, August 23, 2017). Diabetes, not being a listed disease, is not presumed work-related.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The Court finds that the company-designated physicians performed rigourous medical diagnosis, thus their medical assessment should be given weight and credibility by the Court.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** To provide timely medical assessment through company-designated physician (120/240 days). To initiate 3rd doctor referral process when notified that the seafarer disagrees with the company doctor's assessment. To pay for medical expenses and sickness allowances until the seafarer is declared fit to work or a disability assessment is given.
*   **Seafarer:** To undergo medical examinations with the company-designated physician.  If disagreeing with company doctor's assessment, to notify the company and signify intention to resolve conflict by referring the assessment to a third doctor.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioners are liable for the sickness pay of US$1,633.66 and Grade 12 partial disability benefit of US$5,225.00 based on the POEA-SEC schedule.
*   Monetary awards will earn a legal interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of the judgment until full satisfaction based on *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* (716 Phil. 267, 283 (2013)).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Clauses:** The POEA-SEC provisions regarding the third-doctor referral process and the definition of "permanent total disability" can be ambiguous, leading to disputes. The lack of a concrete definition of organ impairment as it relates to hypertension leaves room for interpretation.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof regarding work-relatedness and the severity of hypertension rests on the seafarer. Failure to provide sufficient medical evidence can lead to denial of full benefits.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the final judgment, particularly the interest calculation, may require further legal action.
