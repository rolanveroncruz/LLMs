**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 230687**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that reversed the RTC and reinstated the MTC's decision regarding ownership of a parcel of land (Cadastral Lot No. 286).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** Dispute over ownership of Cadastral Lot No. 286, claimed by both Erlinda Igot (Petitioner) and the Valenzonas (Respondents). Respondents claim through inheritance from Spouses Julian and Sotera Valenzona. Petitioner claims through purchase from Elena Santome, who claimed ownership deriving from Gorgonio Santome.
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. 418):** A prior case (Civil Case No. 418) declared Elena Santome (Petitioner's mother) as the owner of the property against Agapito Valenzona (one of the Valenzona heirs). This is the crux of the appeal.
*   **Res Judicata:** The central issue is whether Civil Case No. 418 constitutes *res judicata* barring the present action. The Supreme Court held that res judicata applies. It reversed the Court of Appeals decision and reinstated the decision of the RTC. The Supreme Court determined that all the elements of res judicata were present, there was a final judgement in Civil Case No. 418 rendered by a court with competent jurisdiction. The subject matter of the decision was the subject property (Cadastral Lot No. 286) and finally the Supreme Court found that there was an identitiy of parties and the same causes of action.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription:** The MTC and CA found that the respondents had acquired ownership through acquisitive prescription by possession for more than 30 years in the concept of owner.

**Parties & Representation:**

*   **Petitioner:** Erlinda S. Igot (claims ownership).
*   **Respondents:** Pio Valenzona, Francisco Valenzona Nunez, Katherine Valenzona Ramirez, Arturo Valenzona, and Aida Valenzona (all represented by Arturo Valenzona).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Valenzonas are obligated to vacate the land in question.
*   Valenzonas are obligated to remove their house and other improvements from the property.
*   Valenzonas are liable to pay the rent at P800 per month from February 2003.
*   Valenzonas are also liable to pay for attorney's fees in the amount of P20,000 and the costs of litigation.

*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al., 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Cites the rule for legal interest.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether there is "substantial identity" of parties for purposes of res judicata, particularly given that not all Valenzona heirs were parties to Civil Case No. 418.
*   The question of whether Agapito Valenzona's actions in Civil Case No. 418 bind the other heirs.

**Potential Risks & Concerns:**

*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the order to vacate and remove improvements, as well as collecting the rent and other monetary awards.
*   **Future Litigation:** Risk of future claims by the Valenzona heirs not explicitly bound by Civil Case No. 418, though the Court holds they *are* bound due to a shared interest.
