## Legal Document Summary: Aguirre v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 170723

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the DOJ Secretary's resolutions, which upheld the dismissal of criminal complaints (falsification, mutilation, and child abuse under Articles 172 & 262 RPC, RA 7610) against respondents for lack of probable cause.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Parties:** Petitioner: Gloria Pilar S. Aguirre; Respondents: Secretary of Justice, Michelina S. Aguirre-Olondriz, Pedro B. Aguirre, Dr. Juvido Agatep, and Dr. Marissa B. Pascual.
*   **Background:** Pedro Aguirre (legal guardian of Laureano "Larry" Aguirre), obtained psychiatric evaluation (Dr. Pascual) and urological services (Dr. Agatep) to perform a vasectomy on Larry. Gloria alleges falsification in Dr. Pascual's psychiatric report, which recommended parental consent for Larry's vasectomy due to mental deficiency. She also alleges that the vasectomy constitutes mutilation and that Lourdes Aguirre (Pedro's spouse) was falsely diagnosed as suffering from Bipolar Mood Disorder.
*   **DOJ Ruling:** The DOJ affirmed the City Prosecutor's dismissal of the criminal complaint due to insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for falsification or mutilation.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the DOJ's resolutions, finding no grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The central question is whether the respondents committed the crimes of falsification (Art. 172, RPC) and mutilation (Art. 262, RPC) with respect to Larry Aguirre.
*   The psychiatric evaluation and subsequent vasectomy must be assessed under the lens of the laws mentioned above to see if it may be considered an abuse.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Falsification Charge:** The core risk lies in the allegation that Dr. Pascual's psychiatric report contained untruthful statements, particularly the implied consent of Larry to the vasectomy, and an incorrect diagnosis of Lourdes Aguirre. Requires analysis under Art. 171, RPC. Issue: Did the report contain any false narration of facts, or falsely claim any involvement from others that did not participate? Was there any intent to cause harm to another?
*   **Mutilation Charge:** Key issue: Whether vasectomy constitutes "mutilation" under Art. 262, RPC, specifically whether it involves deprivation of an "essential organ for reproduction." The Court distinguishes between sterilization and castration, citing *United States v. Esparcia, 36 Phil. 840*.
*   **Standing:** The petitioner, Gloria Pilar, may not have had a standing to bring this case, as she is not a legal guardian nor the injured party.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Articles 171, 172, 262. Defines the crimes of falsification and mutilation, and outlines corresponding penalties.
*   Republic Act No. 7610 ("Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act"): Cited, but not substantially relevant as the court determined the victim was not a child.
*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court: Used by the petitioner.
*   Rule 65 of the Rules of Court: Petition to the Court of Appeals.

**Case Law:**

*   *United States v. Esparcia, 36 Phil. 840:* Used to interpret the meaning of "mutilation" and "castration."
*   *R.R. Paredes v. Calilung, G.R. No. 156055, 5 March 2007, 517 SCRA 369, 394:* Discusses the definition and parameters of "probable cause."

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision. The court found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOJ and City Prosecutor in finding a lack of probable cause. The vasectomy did not constitute mutilation under the RPC, and the allegedly false statements in the psychiatric report did not meet the elements of falsification. Given Gloria's lack of legal standing and a failure to prove a lack of probable cause, the SC affirmed the dismissal of her complaint.
