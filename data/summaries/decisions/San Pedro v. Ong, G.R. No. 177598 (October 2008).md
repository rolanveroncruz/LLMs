**Case:** *Robert San Pedro vs. Willy Ong and Normita Caballes* (G.R. No. 177598, October 16, 2008)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of real estate mortgages constituted by an agent, Adora Dela Peña, on properties previously sold to Petitioner Robert San Pedro. Dela Peña, using fraudulently obtained Special Powers of Attorney (SPAs), mortgaged the properties to Respondent Willy Ong. San Pedro filed an action for Nullification of Mortgage with Damages against Ong, Dela Peña, and others. The RTC initially ruled in San Pedro's favor, declaring the mortgages void. The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, citing lack of jurisdiction over Dela Peña due to improper service of summons. The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the RTC's decision (with a modification).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Quasi in Rem Action:** The Supreme Court held that the action for nullification of mortgage is a quasi in rem action, meaning jurisdiction over the person of Dela Peña was not essential as long as the court had jurisdiction over the res (the properties). *Portic v. Cristobal* (G.R. No. 156171, 22 April 2005) cited as authority.
*   **Improper Service of Summons:** The Supreme Court agreed that service of summons on Dela Peña was defective due to the sheriff's failure to properly effect personal service before resorting to substituted service per Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court. *Spouses Jose v. Spouses Boyon* (460 Phil. 354, 363 (2003)) cited.
*   **Indispensable Party:** The Supreme Court disagreed with the CA, finding that Dela Peña was *not* an indispensable party. The core issue was the validity of the mortgage lien on San Pedro's title, not Dela Peña's personal liability. *Philippine National Bank v. Heirs of Estanislao Militar and Deogracias Militar* (G.R. No. 164801, 18 August 2005) defined indispensable party.
*   **Mortgagee in Good Faith:** The Supreme Court found that Ong was *not* a mortgagee in good faith. He failed to exercise due diligence in verifying Dela Peña's authority to mortgage the properties, especially since she was not the registered owner. Higher diligence is required when dealing with an agent, citing *Abad v. Guimba* (G.R. No. 157002, 29 July 2005) and *Bank of Commerce v. San Pablo, Jr.* (G.R. No. 167848, 27 April 2007).  Reliance on Caballes' representations was insufficient.
*   **Forged SPA:** The fraudulent nature of the SPAs renders the mortgages void ab initio. *Veloso and Rosales v. La Urbana* (58 Phil. 681, 683 (1933)) cited.

**Obligations:**

*   Registry of Deeds for the Province of Bulacan to cancel the recordings of mortgages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ong is *not* entitled to the benefits of a mortgagee-in-good-faith and cannot claim a superior right to the properties.  The SC deleted RTC's order for Dela Peña to pay Ong as this would require jurisdiction over Dela Peña.
*   The ruling is without prejudice to Ong pursuing a separate action against those who committed the fraud.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Ong faces the risk of non-recovery of the loan amount from Dela Peña, absent a separate action and valid service of summons.
*   Further litigation is possible if Ong pursues claims against Dela Peña and/or seeks damages from Caballes for their roles in the fraudulent scheme.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 476:** Action to quiet title.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sec. 6:** Service of summons in personam.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 14:** Substituted service of summons.
*   ***Portic v. Cristobal*** (G.R. No. 156171, 22 April 2005): Quasi in rem action.
*   ***Spouses Jose v. Spouses Boyon*** (460 Phil. 354, 363 (2003)): Substituted service requirements.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Heirs of Estanislao Militar and Deogracias Militar*** (G.R. No. 164801, 18 August 2005): Indispensable party definition.
*   ***Abad v. Guimba*** (G.R. No. 157002, 29 July 2005): Due diligence requirement for mortgagees dealing with agents.
*   ***Bank of Commerce v. San Pablo, Jr.*** (G.R. No. 167848, 27 April 2007): Diligence required when lending against mortgaged property with a non-owner.
*   ***Veloso and Rosales v. La Urbana*** (58 Phil. 681, 683 (1933)): Effect of forged power of attorney.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of Caballes' knowledge and involvement in the fraud, while implied, could be a subject of dispute in future litigation.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the importance of due diligence for mortgagees, particularly when dealing with individuals other than the registered owners of the property.  The decision reinforces established jurisprudence on proper service of summons and the distinction between actions in personam and quasi in rem. While San Pedro's title is secured, the question of Ong's recourse against the perpetrators of the fraud remains.
