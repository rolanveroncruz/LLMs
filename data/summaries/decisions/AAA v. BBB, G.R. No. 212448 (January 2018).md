**Case:** *AAA v. BBB*, G.R. No. 212448, January 11, 2018 (823 Phil. 607)

**Issue:** Whether Philippine courts have jurisdiction over a violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004) when the predicate act (marital infidelity) occurred outside the Philippines.

**Holding:** Yes, Philippine courts can exercise jurisdiction in this scenario. The Supreme Court reversed the RTC's decision to quash the information.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **R.A. No. 9262, Section 5(i):** Criminalizes acts causing mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule, or humiliation to a woman or her child, *including* marital infidelity. The Court clarifies that the law criminalizes the psychological violence and its effect (mental/emotional anguish), and that the act of infidelity is just one of the means by which psychological violence may be committed.
*   **R.A. No. 9262, Section 3(a)(C):**  Defines psychological violence as acts or omissions causing or likely to cause mental or emotional suffering of the victim.
*   **Elements of the crime (Dinamling v. People, 761 Phil. 356 (2015)):**
    1.  Offended party is a woman and/or her child.
    2.  The woman is the wife/ex-wife of the offender or has had a sexual or dating relationship with the offender, or has a common child.
    3.  The offender causes mental or emotional anguish on the woman and/or child.
    4.  The anguish is caused through acts of public ridicule, humiliation, repeated abuse, denial of support/custody, or similar acts. The Court specifically notes that psychological violence is the means, and emotional anguish is the effect/damage.

*   **R.A. No. 9262, Section 7 (Venue):** Family Courts have jurisdiction. In absence of such court, the case may be filed where the crime *or any of its elements* was committed, at the complainant's option. This section, when construed liberally (R.A. 9262, Section 4), implies that the crime may be transitory or continuing in nature, allowing venue where *any* essential element occurs.

*   **Jurisdiction:** Venue is jurisdictional in criminal cases. The Court likens the mental/emotional anguish element to the *damage* element in estafa cases, which is an essential element for jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that the *anguish* suffered by the wife, being a resident of Pasig City, is a sufficient element occurring within the court's jurisdiction for R.A. 9262 to apply.

*   **Territoriality:**  The Court clarifies that the *actus reus* (infidelity) need not occur within the Philippines to establish jurisdiction, as long as the *anguish* (a material element) is experienced by the victim within Philippine territory. This does not preclude the need to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the accused.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The respondent, BBB, is potentially liable for violation of Section 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262. Prosecution must still prove probable cause for charging, and guilt beyond reasonable doubt for conviction.
*   The confidentiality provisions of R.A. 9262 must be strictly observed.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Psychological Violence & Anguish:** Establishing a causal link between the extra-marital affair and the mental/emotional anguish will be crucial. The victim's testimony is essential. This will also be important for proving proximate cause if the court views the affair as a remote cause of the anguish.
*   **Personal Jurisdiction:** The ruling hinges on establishing personal jurisdiction over BBB. If BBB is not present in the Philippines and contests jurisdiction, challenges may arise regarding service of summons and enforcement of any judgment.
*   **Constitutional Challenges:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the decision, the novel application of territorial jurisdiction could potentially face challenges based on due process, particularly if BBB lacks sufficient minimum contacts with the Philippines.
*   **Transitory/Continuing Crime Interpretation:** The application of transitory/continuing crime doctrine could be challenged.
*   **Ambiguity:** As recognized by the lower court, the ambiguity within the law allows room for interpretation that could potentially have detrimental effects.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *Dinamling v. People*, 761 Phil. 356 (2015) - Elements of Section 5(i) violation.
*   *Tre√±as v. People*, 680 Phil. 368 (2012) - Venue as jurisdictional.
*   *Tuzon v. Judge Cruz*, 160 Phil. 925 (1975) - Estafa as analogous to the present crime.
*   *Morillo v. People*, 775 Phil. 192 (2015) - Right to be represented by OSG.
*   *Garcia v. Judge Drilon*, 712 Phil. 44 (2013) - Psychological abuse
*   *People v. Salico*, 84 Phil. 722 (1949) - Dismissal vs Acquittal
*   *Del Socorro v. Van Wilsem*, 749 Phil. 823 (2014) - Appeals in relation to questions of law
*   *Rep. of the Phils., et al. v. Sunvar Realty Development Corp.*, 688 Phil. 616 (2012) - Appeals in relation to questions of law
*   *Isip v. People*, 552 Phil. 786 (2007) - Venue as jurisdictional

**Conclusion:**

This case expands the potential reach of R.A. No. 9262 to include situations where the acts causing psychological violence originate outside the Philippines, provided the victim experiences the resulting anguish within Philippine territory. This raises complex issues of jurisdiction and proof, particularly regarding personal jurisdiction over the accused and establishing the requisite causal link between the act and the anguish.
