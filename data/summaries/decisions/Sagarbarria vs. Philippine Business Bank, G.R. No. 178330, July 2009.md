**Case Summary: Sagarbarria v. Philippine Business Bank (PBB), G.R. No. 178330, July 23, 2009**

**Nature:** Resolution denying Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's decision affirming the CA's ruling upholding the RTC's issuance of a Writ of Possession in favor of PBB after extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Facts:**

*   Petitioner Sagarbarria executed a real estate mortgage over his property to secure a loan for Key Commodities.
*   Key Commodities defaulted, leading PBB to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   Petitioner filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 03-312) to annul the mortgage and foreclosure, seeking an injunction. PBB withdrew its initial application for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   PBB filed an Answer with counterclaim for payment of the loan.
*   While the annulment case was pending, PBB *revived* the extrajudicial foreclosure (alleging the debt ballooned). Property sold to PBB as sole bidder.
*   PBB filed an ex parte petition for Writ of Possession (LRC Case No. M-4676), which the RTC granted.
*   Petitioner challenged the Writ via Certiorari, arguing lack of notice, forum shopping (due to the pending annulment case with counterclaim), and invalidity of the foreclosure.
*   CA affirmed the RTC, holding that the Writ issuance was ministerial, no forum shopping occurred, and Certiorari was not the proper remedy (Act 3135 Sec 8).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** The basis for PBB's right to foreclose. The validity of the mortgage itself is a potential point of contention.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure (Act No. 3135):** PBB's primary remedy. Compliance with Act 3135 is critical.
*   **Writ of Possession (Act No. 3135, Sec. 7):** The central issue. PBB's entitlement after the redemption period expired.
*   **Redemption Period:** Petitioner's failure to redeem the property within one year extinguished his rights of ownership.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks for Petitioner:**

*   **Loss of Property:** Foreclosure was upheld and the redemption period has expired.
*   **Deficiency Claim:** If the proceeds from the foreclosure sale did not fully satisfy the debt, PBB can pursue a deficiency claim against Key Commodities and potentially Sagarbarria as guarantor.
*   **Adverse Possession:** PBB can take possession of the property and eventually sell or otherwise dispose of it.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks for Respondent (PBB):**

*   **Risk of Invalid Foreclosure:** A cloud on the title if the initial foreclosure was not done correctly, i.e., notice requirements, valid publication, etc.
*   **Protracted Litigation:** Despite the ruling in their favor, a clever litigation strategy by the petitioner could result in a prolonged and costly legal battle, which could affect the value of the security.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act No. 4118):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.  Crucial for compliance.
*   **Section 7, Act No. 3135:** Authorizes the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   **Section 8, Act No. 3135:** Provides a mechanism for the debtor to challenge the sale and writ of possession.
*   ***Fernandez v. Espinoza, G.R. No. 156421, April 14, 2008*** (cited in ruling):  Confirms that a pending action for annulment of mortgage or foreclosure does *not* stay the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   ***Saguan v. Philippine Bank of Communications, G.R. No. 159882, November 23, 2007*** (cited in ruling): Discusses the ministerial duty of the court to issue a writ of possession after consolidation of title.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Validity of the Foreclosure Process:** The petitioner's initial complaints about improper notification and forum shopping related to the validity of the foreclosure process.
*   **Forum Shopping Claim:** The petitioner argued that PBB was forum shopping by proceeding with extrajudicial foreclosure while pursuing a counterclaim in the annulment case. The Court rejected this argument.
*   **Proper Remedy:** The CA determined that certiorari was not the appropriate remedy; the petitioner should have filed an appeal under Section 8 of Act 3135. This is important for determining if any further avenues of recourse exist.

**Legal Strategy Considerations for Petitioner (if further action is contemplated):**

*   **Focus on Procedural Defects:** Closely examine the foreclosure proceedings for any procedural defects under Act 3135. If the foreclosure can be invalidated, it may undo the transfer of title and possession.
*   **Damages for Wrongful Foreclosure:** If a claim for annulment fails, a separate claim for damages based on wrongful foreclosure could be considered, if factual and legal basis exists.
*   **Remedies Under Section 8 Act 3135:** Consider whether a claim under Section 8 of Act 3135 remains viable, if the 30-day deadline hasn't passed.

**Legal Strategy Considerations for Respondent (PBB):**

*   **Ensure Clean Title:** Take all necessary steps to ensure that the title to the property is clear and marketable. Address any potential claims by the petitioner or third parties.
*   **Vigilant Monitoring:** Carefully monitor any further legal actions taken by the petitioner and respond promptly and effectively.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld PBB's right to possession of the property. The key issue is whether any actionable procedural defects occurred during the foreclosure process. While the Petitioner's legal options appear limited due to the failure to redeem and the procedural posture of the case, a thorough review of the foreclosure process is warranted to determine if there are any remaining avenues of recourse.
