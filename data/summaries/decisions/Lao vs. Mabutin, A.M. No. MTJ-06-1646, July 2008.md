**Case Summary: *Antonieta Lao v. Judge Odelon S. Mabutin and Efren F. Varela*** (A.M. No. MTJ-06-1646, July 16, 2008)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a judge and clerk of court for (1) simple neglect of duty (Varela) and (2) undue delay in transmitting records (Mabutin) regarding a forcible entry case (Civil Case No. 789).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 40, Section 6, Rules of Court:** Imposes a 15-day deadline on the clerk of court (Varela) to transmit records to the RTC upon perfection of appeal.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41, Section 9:** States that the appeal was perfected when the notice of appeal was filed on 29 July 2002.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 3.08 & 3.09:** Obligates judges (Mabutin) to diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain court management competence, and supervise court personnel to ensure prompt and efficient dispatch of business.

**Findings of Fact:**

*   Lao filed a Notice of Appeal on July 29, 2002.
*   Judge Mabutin granted due course to the appeal on August 12, 2002, ordering the records transmitted to the RTC.
*   Varela only transmitted the records on December 4, 2003, after Lao made follow-ups, exceeding the 15-day deadline.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Varela (Acting Clerk of Court):** Guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty. Sanction: Suspension for one month and one day, with a stern warning. Defined as failure to give attention to a task resulting from carelessness or indifference. The court rejected workload and lack of intention as valid defenses, citing *De Leon-Dela Cruz v. Recacho* and *Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 134, Makati City*. Mitigating circumstances only affect the penalty.
*   **Judge Mabutin:** Guilty of Undue Delay in Transmitting the Records. Sanction: Fine of P11,000, with a stern warning. The Court emphasized that judges are responsible for ensuring timely execution of court orders and cannot delegate away supervisory responsibility. The defense of lack of follow-ups and manpower shortage were rejected. The court cited *Bellena v. Perello* as a relevant precedent and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Garcia-Blanco* regarding the need to promptly administer justice.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Undue Delay":** While the delay was significant (over one year and four months), the determination of what constitutes "undue delay" can be fact-specific and subject to interpretation. *Bellena v. Perello* served as a benchmark, but slight variations in circumstances could be argued.
*   **Reliance on OCA Recommendations:** The Court heavily relied on the Office of the Court Administrator's (OCA) findings and recommendations. Any challenges to the OCA's methodology or factual basis could impact the strength of the decision.
*   **Good Faith as Mitigation, Not Exculpation:** The Court consistently emphasized that good faith is merely a mitigating factor, not a complete defense against administrative liability. This highlights the strict liability imposed on court personnel for fulfilling their duties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 40, Section 6**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 41, Section 9**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140, Sections 9 and 11(B)(2)**
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, Canon 6, Section 2**
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 53**
*   *De Leon-Dela Cruz v. Recacho, A.M. No. P-06-2122, 17 July 2007, 527 SCRA 622*

*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Garcia-Blanco, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1941, 25 April 2006, 488 SCRA 109*

**Conclusion:** The decision underscores the importance of timely execution of court orders and diligent performance of duties by court personnel. It highlights the principle that good faith and heavy workload are not valid excuses for dereliction of duty, serving as a deterrent against similar lapses in the future.
