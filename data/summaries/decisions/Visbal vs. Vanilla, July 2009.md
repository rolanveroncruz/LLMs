Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Provincial Prosecutor Robert M. Visbal vs. Judge Wenceslao B. Vanilla* (A.M. No. MTJ-06-1651)

**Court:** Supreme Court, Special Second Division

**Date:** July 15, 2009

**Subject Matter:**  Administrative matter regarding a judge's alleged ignorance of the law.

**Summary:**

This Resolution concerns a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Judge Vanilla, after the Court initially found him guilty of ignorance of the law and imposed a fine of P10,000 for archiving a criminal case immediately after issuing a warrant of arrest.  The Motion argues that Prosecutor Visbal failed to exhaust available judicial remedies before filing the administrative complaint, citing *Benjamin M. Mina, Jr. v. Judge B. Corales, etc.* (A.M. No. RTJ-07-2083, September 27, 2007, 534 SCRA 200, citing *Flores v. Abesamis, 279 SCRA 303 (1997)*).  The Motion also attempts to demonstrate a pattern of Prosecutor Visbal filing administrative cases against judges, presenting a decision in *Provincial Prosecutor Robert M. Visbal v. Judge Marino S. Buban* (A.M. No. MTJ-02-1432, September 3, 20094, 437 SCRA 520).

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Denial of Motion for Reconsideration:** The Court *denies* Judge Vanilla's Motion for Reconsideration with finality.
*   **Exhaustion of Judicial Remedies Not a Bar:** The Court holds that the doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies is *not* a mandatory prerequisite to filing an administrative complaint against a judge for gross ignorance of the law. This is because an administrative case seeks disciplinary action, separate from challenging the underlying case's ruling.
*   **Waiver Argument:** The Court notes that Judge Vanilla already participated in the OCA investigation, thereby implicitly waiving any argument regarding exhaustion of remedies. He submitted a comment and a manifestation, both requesting dismissal.
*   **Disciplinary Action as a Separate Matter:** Filing an administrative case is not a required "remedy" to challenge or reverse the ruling in the underlying case of gross ignorance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judge Vanilla remains liable for the fine of P10,000 imposed in the initial decision for ignorance of the law.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact of Prior Actions:** Judge Vanilla's failure to raise the exhaustion of remedies argument earlier in the proceedings proved fatal to his motion.
*   **No Ambiguity:** The Court is clear in its holding that exhaustion is not a *sine qua non* for administrative actions against judges.
*   **Prosecutorial Misconduct (Counter-Argument):** Judge Vanilla attempted to portray Prosecutor Visbal as vexatious. While unsuccessful in this case, this may raise a question of prosecutorial misconduct that could be explored in other appropriate venues.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   *Benjamin M. Mina, Jr. v. Judge B. Corales, etc.* (A.M. No. RTJ-07-2083, September 27, 2007, 534 SCRA 200, citing *Flores v. Abesamis, 279 SCRA 303 (1997)*)
*   *Provincial Prosecutor Robert M. Visbal v. Judge Marino S. Buban* (A.M. No. MTJ-02-1432, September 3, 20094, 437 SCRA 520).
*   *Flores v. Abesamis* (A.M. No. SC-96-1, July 10, 1997, 275 SCRA 302)
*   Rule 65 (Certiorari) Rules of Court
