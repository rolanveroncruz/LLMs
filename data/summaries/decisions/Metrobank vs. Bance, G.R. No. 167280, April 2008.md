## Legal Document Summary - *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company vs. SPS. Elmor V. Bance and Rosario J. Bance* (G.R. No. 167280, April 30, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision annulling a Writ of Possession issued by the RTC.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Respondents (Bances) obtained loans from Petitioner (Metrobank), secured by mortgages on their real properties.
*   **Foreclosure:** Respondents defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure by Metrobank, who was the highest bidder at the public auction.
*   **Writ of Possession:** Metrobank obtained a Writ of Possession from RTC Branch 4.
*   **Action for Nullity:** Respondents filed a separate action (Civil Case No. 00-97252) in RTC Branch 32, seeking to nullify the loans, mortgages, and foreclosure proceedings, initially obtaining a TRO.
*   **Annulment of RTC Order:** The Court of Appeals annulled the RTC Branch 4 order granting the Writ of Possession, citing extrinsic fraud and forum shopping.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:** Obligated to repay the loans. Failure resulted in foreclosure.
*   **Petitioner:** Obligated to follow proper procedures for foreclosure under Act No. 3135.

**Liabilities:**

*   The central issue revolves around whether Metrobank followed proper procedure for issuing the Writ of Possession. If it didn't, the foreclosure will be deemed invalid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential Invalidity of Foreclosure:** If the CA's annulment of the Writ of Possession stands, it could jeopardize Metrobank's acquisition of the mortgaged properties.
*   **Damages:** Respondents could potentially seek damages if the foreclosure was deemed improper.
*   **Continued Litigation:** A win for the bank does not mean an end to litigation. As the ruling states, the Writ of Possession is ministerial, but subject to the outcome of Civil Case No. 00-97252.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** *An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted in or Annexed to Real Estate Mortgages.* Crucial for procedures on extrajudicial foreclosure and issuance of writs of possession.
    *   **Section 7:** Pertains to petitioning the court for possession during the redemption period and furnishing a bond. The court says that a bond is unnecessary in this case because of the redemption.
    *   **Section 8:** Relates to the mortgagor's remedy for irregular issuance of the Writ of Possession (petition to set aside sale and cancel the writ within 30 days). Respondents did not pursue this.
*   **1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 7, Section 5:** Pertains to forum shopping.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extrinsic Fraud:** The CA's finding of extrinsic fraud is contentious. The Supreme Court found none because of the ex parte nature of the Writ of Possession application.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision, finding that Metrobank was entitled to the Writ of Possession. The court reasoned that an application for the issuance of a Writ of Possession is an ex parte proceeding, and that any issues regarding the validity of the mortgage should be challenged within a certain period. The court also found that Metrobank did not engage in forum shopping. The case hinges on the proper interpretation and application of Act No. 3135 and the nature of the Writ of Possession proceedings. While the bank secured the writ, there is still a pending case that may affect the bank's win.
