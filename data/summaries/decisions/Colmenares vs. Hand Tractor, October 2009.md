**Legal Document Summary: *Colmenares v. Hand Tractor Parts and Agro-Industrial Corp.*, G.R. No. 170790 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Action for sum of money based on unpaid account for paddle wheels.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sale on Credit:** Petitioner (Colmenares) purchased paddle wheels from Respondent (Hand Tractor Parts) on credit. Delivery evidenced by delivery receipts. Invoice issued.
*   **Partial Payments:** Petitioner made partial payments, evidenced by official receipts, leaving a balance.
*   **Interest:**  The charge invoice stipulates 12% interest per annum on overdue accounts.  A handwritten modification to 3% *per month* (36% annually) was not substantiated by Respondent.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The charge invoice includes a clause imposing 25% of the amount due as attorney's fees and cost of collection in case of suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court held the Petitioner liable for the remaining balance on the purchase price, plus 12% interest per annum, and 25% of the total amount due for attorney's fees and costs of collection, based on a stipulation found in the charge invoice.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interest Rate:** The key contentious issue was the interest rate. Respondent failed to adequately explain or prove the handwritten alteration on the invoice increasing the interest rate. The Court applied the originally stated 12% per annum.
*   **Proof of Debt:** Petitioner argued insufficient evidence to prove the existence of the debt. The Court rejected this, citing delivery receipts, the invoice, and the Petitioner's own letter acknowledging the debt (though disputing the amount) as sufficient proof.
*   **Reliance on Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court relied heavily on the factual findings of the lower courts, especially the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's assessment of the evidence. This is standard practice under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, which generally restricts the Supreme Court to questions of law.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law when reviewing CA decisions.  Cited extensively because Petitioner raised factual issues.
*   **Article 2208, Civil Code:**  Governs the award of attorney's fees.  The Court based the attorney's fees award on the stipulation in the charge invoice, which is an exception to the general rule against awarding attorney's fees absent a contractual provision.
*   **Doctrine of Preponderance of Evidence:** The Court held that the Respondent met its burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence.
*   *Reyes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 147758 (2002) (Definition of Preponderance of Evidence)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The handwritten modification of the interest rate on the charge invoice was a significant point of contention. The court did not uphold the modification because it was not clearly explained or justified by the respondent.

**Key Takeaways/Advice:**

*   The Court heavily relied on the existing documentary evidence as well as admissions made by the Petitioner in determining the existence of the debt.
*   The importance of documenting and being able to substantiate any contractual modifications is highlighted.
*   Contractual stipulations regarding interest and attorney's fees will generally be enforced.
