## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dimapilis* (G.R. Nos. 128619-21)

**Case Overview:** This is an automatic review of a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Eleuterio Dimapilis of three counts of rape against his step-daughter, Sharon Salas, and sentencing him to death for each count. The incidents allegedly occurred in September 1994, February 1996, and May 1996.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Rape Conviction:** The trial court found Dimapilis guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on the victim's testimony and medical evidence (healed superficial hymenal laceration).
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The trial court imposed the death penalty based on the victim being under 18 and the offender being the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim, which under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659) allows the imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Supreme Court Modification:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the sentence from death to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Defective Informations:** Accused-appellant alleges that the informations are defective for failing to allege specific dates of commission of rape. The Court held that it has been "substantial observance of the rules" on time of commission and that Dimapilis has been properly apprised of the charges proffered against him. The failure to object to the form or substance of the informations earlier constitutes waiver.
*   **Relationship Mischaracterization:** The Information described the victim as the *step-daughter*, but the Court clarifies she is the *daughter of the common-law spouse*. This discrepancy proved crucial.
*   **Allegation of Qualifying Circumstance:**  Since the information described the victim as "step-daughter," the true relationship, which would trigger the capital penalty was not alleged in the information.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Dimapilis):**
    *   Found guilty of three counts of rape.
    *   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* per count.
    *   Ordered to pay moral damages of P100,000.00 per count.
    *   Ordered to pay exemplary damages of P50,000.00 per count.
    *   Ordered to pay civil indemnity ex delicto of P50,000.00 to Sharon Salas for each count.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Victim Testimony:** The case heavily relies on the victim's testimony, which while deemed credible, could be challenged on appeal (if future appeals are pursued) based on inconsistencies or lack of corroboration.  However, the Court has ruled that the positive identification of the offender given by the complainant outweighs accused-appellant's alibi.
*   **Hymenal Laceration:** Although the medical certificate confirmed the presence of an old healed hymenal laceration, this is not conclusive proof of rape and could be subject to challenges.

**Relevant Law & Case Law:**

*   **Art. 335, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659):** Defines and punishes rape and specifies aggravating circumstances leading to the death penalty.
*   **Rules 110 and 117 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Sec. 6 and Sec. 11 provides for the sufficiency of complaint or information and time of the commission of offense. Sec. 8 discusses failure to move to quash or to allege any ground therefor.
*   **Case Law cited within:** This case references several other Supreme Court decisions regarding the credibility of rape victim testimony, the definition of rape, and the requirements for proving alibi.

**Legal Precision & Ambiguity:**

*   **Key Ambiguity Resolved:** The ambiguity regarding the exact relationship between the victim and accused was crucial in mitigating the sentence. The Court clarified that the prosecution's mischaracterization of the relationship as "step-daughter" was not enough to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Circumstances for mandatory death penalty:** Republic Act 7659 mandates a single indivisible penalty of death upon attendance of certain aggravating circumstances which are in the nature of qualifying circumstances, which therefore need to be stated in the information to warrant the imposition of the death penalty.
