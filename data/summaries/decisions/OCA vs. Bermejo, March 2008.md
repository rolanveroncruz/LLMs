## Case Summary: OCA vs. Bermejo, A.M. No. P-05-2004

**Nature:** Administrative case for Dishonesty against Lourdes F. Bermejo, a Court Stenographer II, for allegedly using another person to take her Civil Service Eligibility Exam.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Allegation:** Bermejo is accused of allowing another person to impersonate her during the Civil Service exam.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Anonymous letter and CSC Memorandum highlighting discrepancies between Bermejo's photograph and the person who took the exam under her name.
    *   Certified copy of the Seat Plan indicating a different person taking the exam using Bermejo's name.
    *   Evidence of travel to Pampanga to take the exam
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Bermejo denied the allegations, blaming her husband's mistress and claiming she personally took the exam. She admitted that she did take the exam, but denies impersonation
*   **OCA Finding:** The OCA recommended dismissal based on evidence suggesting impersonation and Bermejo's inconsistent statements.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Duty of honesty and integrity expected of a court employee.
*   Violation of Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19-99, classifying dishonesty as a grave offense.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   Reliance on anonymous complaint, though corroborated by documentary evidence.
*   Bermejo's claim of a vindictive motive by her husband's mistress is circumstantial, but the court has said is is not enough to discard the evidence.
*   Discrepancy in the birthdate that Bermejo claimed responsibility for

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **CSC vs. Sta. Ana (450 Phil. 59):** Similar case involving discrepancies in Personal Data Sheets and exam applications, resulting in a finding of dishonesty. It states that procedures during examinations are followed, and a mixing up of signatures and pictures is unlikely to occur.
*   **Donato v. Civil Service Commission Regional Office No. 1 (G.R. No. 165788):** Case involving impersonation and falsification of documents, highlighting the active participation of both the impersonator and the impersonated. There will always be two people involved in the offense of impersonation.
*   **Concerned Citizen v. Gabral, A.M. No. P-05-2098:** Defines "dishonesty" as intentionally making a false statement on any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, appointment or registration.
*   **Re: Spurious Certificate of Eligibility of Tessie G. Quires, Regional Trial Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 05-5-268-RTC:** The judiciary demands for moral righteousness from an employee.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** Defines penalties for dishonesty.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19-99:** Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Contentious Issues:**

*   Bermejo's alleged inability to explain the discrepancies in the Seat Plan and her failure to locate the alleged impersonator.
*   The question of whether the prosecution has proved the identity of Bermejo being impersonated beyond reasonable doubt.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court found Bermejo GUILTY of dishonesty and DISMISSED her from service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and with prejudice to reemployment in any government branch or instrumentality.
