## Legal Document Summary: RBC Cable Master System vs. Baluyot, G.R. No. 172670

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal and award of separation pay and backwages to respondent Baluyot.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's finding of illegal dismissal. The Court ruled against the petitioner RBC Cable Master System’s contentions that Baluyot abandoned his work and that he was dismissed for just cause based on Article 282 of the Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended. The fact of illegal dismissal was supported by the following reasoning:

    *   **No Abandonment:** Baluyot's actions, including filing a case for illegal dismissal, were inconsistent with an intention to abandon his employment. Failure to send a notice of termination on the ground of abandonment. (Icawat vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 334 SCRA 75, 81 [2000]).
    *   **Condonation:** The Court of Appeals was correct that the infractions made were condoned. The execution of a promissory note by Baluyot after his suspension was interpreted as a condonation of his previous infractions, negating the claim that these justified termination.
    *   **Insufficient Evidence of Just Cause:** The petitioners failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that Baluyot was properly terminated for just cause.

*   **Backwages and Separation Pay:** The Court affirmed the award of backwages from the date of illegal dismissal (March 1, 2001) until the finality of the decision. Due to the strained relations between the parties, reinstatement was deemed not viable, and separation pay was awarded at a rate of one (1) month's salary for every year of service from the date of dismissal to the finality of the decision.

**Obligations:**

*   **RBC Cable Master System:** Obligated to pay Baluyot backwages and separation pay as computed from March 1, 2001, until the date of the final decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RBC Cable Master System:** Liable for the financial consequences of the illegal dismissal, including backwages, separation pay.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Quantification of Backwages & Separation Pay:** The precise monetary amount of backwages and separation pay could become contentious and may require further proceedings for accurate computation, considering factors like allowances and other benefits.
*   **Strained Relations:** The finding of "strained relations" precluding reinstatement is a common issue in illegal dismissal cases and can be challenged if circumstances change.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282, Labor Code of the Philippines (Just Causes for Dismissal):** Used by petitioners to argue dismissal was valid. The Court ultimately rejected this argument.
*   **Rule IV, Section 3-C of the 1990 NLRC Rules of Procedure:** Pertains to the scope of NLRC review, cited by petitioners.
*   **Republic Act No. 6715 (Amendments to the Labor Code regarding Backwages):** Established the employee’s entitlement to full backwages and benefits.
*   **Supreme Court jurisprudence on abandonment (Labor v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 110388, September 14, 1995, 248 SCRA 183):** Definition of Abandonment.
*   **Supreme Court jurisprudence on strained relations. (Globe Telecom, Inc. vs Florendo-Flores, 390 SCRA 201, 2002[sic]-203 [2002]).**
