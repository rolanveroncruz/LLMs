## Legal Document Summary: Montuerto v. Ty

**Case:** *Montuerto v. Ty*, G.R. No. 177736, October 10, 2008 (588 Phil. 954)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's affirmation of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) resolution recalling Montuerto's appointment as Municipal Budget Officer.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Montuerto's appointment as Municipal Budget Officer, *de facto* for almost ten years and approved by the CSC, can be revoked due to lack of written Sangguniang Bayan (SB) concurrence.

*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CSC's recall and the CA's affirmation.

*   **Basis:** The Court emphasized the mandatory requirement of Section 443(a) and (d) of the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160) that the appointment of heads of municipal departments/offices (like the Municipal Budget Officer) by the Mayor *must* have the concurrence of the majority of SB members, subject to civil service laws.

*   **Absence of Concurrence:** The SC affirmed the factual finding that Montuerto's appointment lacked the required SB concurrence, either through formal submission or documented approval. The SB Secretary's Certification and minutes confirmed the lack of record.

*   **Verbal Concurrence Insufficient:** The Court rejected the argument of a "verbal concurrence," holding that the SB acts through resolution or ordinance. (See *Municipality of La Libertad, Negros Oriental v. Penaflor*, G.R. No. 155477, March 18, 2005, 453 SCRA 833, 841).

*   **CSC Authority to Recall:** As Montuerto's appointment was invalid *ab initio* due to lack of SB concurrence, the CSC had the authority to recall it, irrespective of her length of service.  (See *Sales v. Carreon, Jr.*, G.R. No. 160791, February 13, 2007, 515 SCRA 597, 607).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Montuerto):** Obligated to vacate the position of Municipal Budget Officer. No legal claim to the office.
*   **Mayor:** Duty to comply with statutory requirements for appointments, including obtaining SB concurrence.
*   **Sangguniang Bayan:** Obligation to formally act on mayoral appointments within fifteen (15) days of submission as stipulated in the law.
*   **Civil Service Commission:** Authority and responsibility to ensure compliance with civil service laws and regulations, including verifying the validity of appointments.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Ambiguity:** The document only states that the SB shall act on the appointment within fifteen days of submission. It doesn't specify whether the *absence* of action within 15 days constitutes a deemed confirmation.
*   **Impact on Previous Actions:** The ruling implies that all actions taken by Montuerto as Municipal Budget Officer without valid appointment could be challenged. This could create potential administrative or financial liabilities for the Municipality.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Section 443(a) and (d):** Mandatory requirement for mayoral appointments to have SB concurrence.
*   ***Municipality of La Libertad, Negros Oriental v. Penaflor*, G.R. No. 155477, March 18, 2005, 453 SCRA 833, 841:**  Affirms that the SB acts through resolution or ordinance.
*   ***Sales v. Carreon, Jr.*, G.R. No. 160791, February 13, 2007, 515 SCRA 597, 607:** Upholds the CSC's authority to recall invalid appointments.

**Legal Analysis:**

The case underscores the strict interpretation and enforcement of statutory requirements for government appointments. The requirement of formal SB concurrence is crucial for ensuring local autonomy and checks and balances in appointments. The Court's rejection of the "verbal concurrence" argument emphasizes the importance of documented evidence in administrative proceedings. The ruling has implications for other local government appointments where compliance with statutory requirements may be questionable.
