## Legal Document Summary: *De La Cruz v. Maersk Filipinas Crewing, Inc.* G.R. No. 172038

**Case Overview:**
This case involves a claim for illegal dismissal filed by Dante D. de la Cruz, a seafarer, against Maersk Filipinas Crewing, Inc. and Elite Shipping A.S. The petitioner was hired as a third engineer but was discharged during his probationary period due to alleged poor performance. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in favor of the petitioner, finding the dismissal illegal due to lack of due process and just cause.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Nine-month contract as third engineer with Elite Shipping A.S., facilitated by Maersk Filipinas Crewing.
*   **CBA Article 1 (7):** Allows termination during the first 60 days (probationary period) with 14 days written notice based on dissatisfaction from the vessel master.
*   **POEA Revised Standard Employment Terms and Conditions (Section 17):** Outlines disciplinary procedures requiring (1) written notice of charges with grounds, date, time, and place of investigation, (2) investigation with opportunity to be heard, and (3) written notice of penalty with reasons.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** To prove just cause for dismissal and compliance with procedural due process (two-notice rule under POEA guidelines).

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents were found liable for illegal dismissal, entitling petitioner to monetary compensation.
*   **Damages:** Although initially awarded by the LA, moral and exemplary damages were deleted by the NLRC. This aspect was not directly addressed by the SC.
*   **Monetary Equivalent:** Reinstatement of the NLRC resolution implies liability for the monetary equivalent of the unexpired portion of the contract.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of CBA Article 1 (7):** The CBA provision on probationary dismissal was deemed insufficient to override POEA requirements for due process and just cause. The SC deemed the petitioner was illegaly dismissed even during his first sixty days of service.
*   **Sufficiency of Notice:** The vagueness of the logbook entries, lacking specific details of the alleged performance deficiencies, failed to meet the requirement of a written notice of charges as required by the POEA guidelines.
*   **Probationary vs. Contractual Employment:** While the CBA stipulated a probationary period, the SC emphasized that seafarers are contractual employees whose rights are primarily governed by the POEA Standard Employment Contract and RA 8042, not necessarily by the CBA. This clarifies that "probationary" in this context means "eligible for re-hire."
*   **Failure to Conduct Formal Investigation:**  The absence of a formal investigation and opportunity for the seafarer to present his side violated procedural due process.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995):** Governs the rights and obligations of overseas Filipino workers.
*   **POEA Revised Standard Employment Terms and Conditions:** Establishes standard employment terms and conditions for Filipino seafarers.
*   **Skippers United Pacific, Inc. v. NLRC:**  Cited to support the employer's burden of proving just cause and compliance with due process in dismissal cases.
*   **Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora:** Establishes that seafarers are not covered by the Labor Code's definition of regular employment but are contractual employees.
*   **Millares v. NLRC:** Clarifies the meaning of "permanent and probationary masters and employees" in the context of seafarer contracts, explaining it as "eligible for re-hire."
*   **Luz v. National Amnesty Commission:** Case cited for computation of time when motion of extension is granted.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The CBA clause regarding the probationary period's effect and rights was ultimately overridden by POEA provisions.
