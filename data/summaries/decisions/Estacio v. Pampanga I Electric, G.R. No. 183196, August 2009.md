Here's a concise legal summary of the provided *Estacio v. PELCO I* case:

**Case:** *Chona Estacio and Leopoldo Manliclic v. Pampanga I Electric Cooperative, Inc., and Loliano E. Allas* (G.R. No. 183196, August 19, 2009)

**Issue:** Validity of dismissal of Chona Estacio (bill custodian) and Leopoldo Manliclic (bill collector) by PELCO I.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding *valid cause* for the dismissal of both employees.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Estacio's Dismissal:**
    *   **Cause:** Gross and habitual neglect of duty under Section 6.6.6 of PELCO I's Board Policy No. 01-04.  Specifically, failure to maintain accurate records of bills, leading to P123,807.14 in unremitted funds.
    *   **Estacio's Defense:** Claimed flooding prevented her from updating records. Court found this unpersuasive.
    *   **Court's Reasoning:**  Consistent failure to perform duties, disregarding fundamental responsibilities. *JGB and Associates, Inc. v. NLRC* (324 Phil. 747 (1996)) cited re: definition of "Gross negligence connotes want of care in the performance of one's duties. Habitual neglect implies repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time, depending upon the circumstances."
*   **Manliclic's Dismissal:**
    *   **Cause:**  Offenses against PELCO I properties, specifically misappropriation of funds (P4,813.11), violating Section 2.1 of Board Policy No. 01-04.  Admitted using collection money for personal reasons and lending some to a co-employee.
    *   **Court's Reasoning:** Breach of trust inherent in his position as a bill collector, *Piedad v. Lanao del Norte* (G.R. No. L-73735, 31 August 1987, 153 SCRA 500) is cited for the proposition that an employee's actions need not have resulted in material damage or prejudice before his dismissal on grounds of loss of confidence may be effected and *Garcia v. NLRC* (327 Phil. 1097 (1996)) is cited for the proposition that "the position of cashier is a highly sensitive position, requiring as it does the attributes of absolute trust and honesty because of the temptations attendant to the daily handling of money."

*   **Due Process:**  Both employees were given notice and opportunity to explain their actions. Estacio even had a formal hearing.

*   **Board Resolutions:** PELCO I Board initially passed resolutions (Nos. 38 & 39) reinstating the employees. Later, a new resolution (No. 53-06) authorized the General Manager (Allas) to file a Petition for Certiorari challenging the NLRC decision.
    *   **Petitioners' Argument:** PELCO I was estopped from reversing its position.
    *   **Court's Reasoning:**  No estoppel. Petitioners had knowledge of the facts. No false representation by the Board. *Philippine National Bank v. Palma, G.R. No. 157279, 9 August 2005, 466 SCRA 307, 323-325*, *The Insular Life Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Asset Builders Corp., 466 Phil. 751, 773 (2004)*, *Republic Glass v. Qua, 479 Phil. 393 (2004)*, *Philippine Stock Exchange, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 346 Phil. 218, 234 (1997)*, *Mijares v. Court of Appeals, 338 Phil. 274, 289 (1997)*, *The Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. v. Asset Builders Corporation, supra note 41 at 772*, also questions of policy and of management are left to the honest decision of the officers and directors of a corporation (or in this case, cooperative), and the courts are without authority to substitute their judgment for the judgment of the board of directors

*   **Legal Personality:** Allas had legal standing to file the Petition for Certiorari on his own behalf (as a named respondent) and on behalf of PELCO I (supported by Board Resolution 53-06).
*   **Statutory Reference:**  Article 282 of the Labor Code (valid causes for termination) is referenced.  Also Articles 283 and 284.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   The initial Board resolutions reinstating the employees, while ultimately superseded, could have created a basis for reliance, although the court found the elements of equitable estoppel lacking.
*   The case highlights the importance of clear and consistently enforced company policies regarding handling of funds and reporting duties. The reliance on Board Policy 01-04 was crucial to the court's reasoning.
