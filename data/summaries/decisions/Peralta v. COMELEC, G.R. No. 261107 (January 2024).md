## Legal Document Summary: Peralta v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 261107 (January 30, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC Resolutions finding probable cause for election overspending.

**Key Issue:** Whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause for election overspending due to inordinate delay in the preliminary investigation, violating petitioner's right to a speedy disposition of cases.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition, NULLIFIED the COMELEC resolutions (Resolution No. 18-0656 dated August 8, 2018, and Resolution No. 21-0472-57 dated July 14, 2021), and DISMISSED the complaint against Ana Liza Arriola Peralta.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 100, Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code, as amended by RA 7166):** Limits campaign expenditures per registered voter.
*   **Section 262, Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code):** Defines violation of Section 100 as an election offense.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 34, Sec. 8:** Mandates termination of preliminary investigation within 20 days of receiving counter-affidavits and a resolution within 5 days thereafter.
*   **Constitutional Right to Speedy Disposition of Cases (Article III, Section 16):** Guarantees all persons the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Election Overspending (Violation of OEC Sec. 100 in relation to Sec. 262):**  Potential criminal prosecution for exceeding campaign expenditure limits.

**Reasons for Ruling:**

*   **Inordinate Delay:** The COMELEC took over six years (May 9, 2015 to July 14, 2021) to resolve the preliminary investigation, far exceeding the 20-day period prescribed by its own rules.
*   **Lack of Justification:** The COMELEC failed to adequately explain or justify the delay, especially given the relatively simple nature of the case.
*   **Violation of Right to Speedy Disposition of Cases:** The unreasonable delay prejudiced the petitioner, warranting dismissal of the complaint.
*   **Relied on *Peñas v. COMELEC* and *Ecleo v. COMELEC*** The court looked back at the cases which involved similar facts and issues to arrive at its decision.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Errors in SOCE:** The petitioner argued that discrepancies in the SOCE were due to errors by her secretary and corrected by affidavits from contributors. The COMELEC initially rejected this as an afterthought.
*   **Inadvertence vs. Confession:** The COMELEC treated the initial SOCE, despite alleged errors, as a *prima facie* admission of overspending.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Cagang v. Sandiganbayan:** Provides the guidelines for determining whether the right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated.
*   **Peñas v. Commission on Elections:**  A case with similar facts and issues, where the Supreme Court ruled that COMELEC's delay constituted grave abuse of discretion. The Court based their decision off of this specific case.
*   **Ecleo v. Commission on Elections:** Case was used to show that her right to a speedy disposition of cases had been violated.
*   **Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan, et al.:** States that any party to a case may demand expeditious action from all officials who are tasked with the administration of justice.
*   **Enriquez v. Office of the Ombudsman:** States that the factors that may be considered and balanced when the right has been violated is the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the aggrieved party's assertion or failure to assert such right, and the prejudice caused by the delay.

**Potential Risks Moving Forward:**

*   While the case was dismissed due to inordinate delay, the COMELEC could potentially investigate the contributors for false statements if it believes that the affidavits are not truthful.
*   This ruling reinforces the importance of the COMELEC adhering to its procedural rules and respecting the constitutional right to a speedy disposition of cases.
