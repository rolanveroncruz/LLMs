*   **Effect of Annotation on TCT No. RT-20895 after enactment of PD 957, PD 1344 and EO 648.** The court argued that it was impliedly modified.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the HLURB has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute because it involves enforcement of statutory and contractual obligations related to subdivision development. The Court also noted that the petitioners raised only a question of law, which should have been appealed directly to the Supreme Court via certiorari, not to the Court of Appeals. Finally, the Court clarified that a petition for certiorari cannot substitute for a lost appeal due to an erroneous choice of remedy.
