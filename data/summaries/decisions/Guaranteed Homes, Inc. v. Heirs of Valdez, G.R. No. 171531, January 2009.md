**Case:** Guaranteed Homes, Inc. vs. Heirs of Maria P. Valdez, et al., G.R. No. 171531, January 30, 2009 (597 Phil. 437)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order dismissing the complaint filed by the respondents (heirs of Pablo Pascua) seeking reconveyance of land covered by OCT No. 404 in Pablo Pascua's name. The petitioner, Guaranteed Homes, Inc. (GHI), acquired the land from spouses Rodolfo, who held TCT No. T-8242. The respondents claimed Pablo's son, Cipriano, fraudulently claimed to be the sole heir and confirmed prior sales, leading to the issuance of titles eventually held by GHI.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Cause of Action:** The SC ruled the complaint fails to state a cause of action against GHI.
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value (IPV):**  GHI is deemed an IPV. The complaint did not allege any defect in the title of GHI's predecessors (spouses Rodolfo) or any circumstance that should have put GHI on inquiry.  A purchaser dealing with registered property need not go beyond the title. *See Fule and Aragon v. De Legare and CA, 117 Phil. 367, 377 (1963).* *See also Co v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 93687, 6 May 1991, 196 SCRA 705, 713*
*   **Cancellation of OCT:** The SC stated that OCT No. 404 was expressly cancelled by TCT No. T-8241.
*   **Extrajudicial Settlement:** While the extrajudicial settlement by Cipriano was not binding on other heirs, it had operative effect under Section 44 of the Property Registration Decree as GHI purchased in good faith.
*   **Forged or Fraudulent Deed:** Even if the extrajudicial settlement was a forgery, GHI is protected as the certificate of title was transferred to the forger and then sold to an IPV. *See Director of Lands v. Addison, 49 Phil. 19 (1926)*.
*   **Quieting of Title:** Respondents lack a cause of action for quieting of title because OCT No. 404 was cancelled. They did not specify possession of the property.
*   **Statute of Limitations/Laches (Implied Trust):** The other heirs of Pablo should have filed an action for reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust within ten (10) years from the date of registration or issuance of the title. *See Vda de Portugal v. Intermediate Appellate Court, No. L- 73564, 159 SCRA 178*
*   **Assurance Fund:** Claim against the Assurance Fund cannot prosper, as Section 101 of P.D. No. 1529 exempts the fund from liability for breaches of trust and the action has prescribed after 6 years.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review.
*   **Section 44, Property Registration Decree (P.D. No. 1529):**  Good faith purchaser protected from encumbrances not on title.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529:** Land Registration.
*   **Act No. 496, Section 56:** Relates to Registration Procedures.
*   **Civil Code, Article 477:** Pertains to Actions for Quieting of Title
*   **Civil Code, Article 1456:** Establishes implied trust in cases of mistake or fraud.
*   **P.D. No. 1529, Sections 52, 56, 101, 102:** Provisions relating to public registry, Assurance Fund, and limitation of actions.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Forgery:** Although the Court finds GHI's title valid even assuming forgery, the allegation of forgery in the extrajudicial settlement could potentially be re-litigated in a different context, depending on the actions of other affected parties.
*   **Good Faith Determination:** While the Court determined GHI to be an IPV, future challenges could hinge on arguments that GHI had constructive notice of defects, however unlikely.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC affirms the validity of GHI's title based on its status as an innocent purchaser for value relying on a clean title.  The respondents' claims are time-barred and fail to establish a viable cause of action. The possibility of GHI losing title is considered low as it is deemed an innocent purchaser for value.
