Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, focusing on the key procedural issues:

**Case:** *PNB-Republic Bank (now Maybank Philippines, Inc.) vs. Spouses Jose and Salvacion Cordova*

**Citation:** G.R. No. 169314, March 14, 2008 (572 Phil. 326)

**Subject Matter:** Procedural issue regarding perfection of appeal and jurisdiction of the trial court after modification of a decision.

**Background:**

*   The RTC initially dismissed Maybank's (PNB-Republic Bank) complaint for rescission of a lease contract but granted the Cordova's counterclaim.
*   Maybank filed a timely Notice of Appeal (First Notice).
*   The Cordovas moved for reconsideration, which the RTC granted, increasing the damages awarded.
*   Maybank then filed a Motion for Reconsideration and subsequently a Second Notice of Appeal.
*   The CA dismissed Maybank's appeal, holding that the first notice was ineffective and the second notice was filed late.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Perfection of Appeal (Rule 41, Section 9, Rules of Court):** The Supreme Court (SC) reaffirms that an appeal is perfected upon the timely filing of the notice of appeal (or approval of record on appeal). Maybank's first notice of appeal was deemed perfected as to them.
*   **Effect of Motion for Reconsideration on Appeal:** The SC held that Maybank did not need to file a second notice of appeal after the RTC modified its decision because they already perfected their appeal with the first notice. The filing of a second notice is considered a "superfluity".
*   **Trial Court Jurisdiction:** The trial court lost jurisdiction over the *subject matter* of the appeal upon perfection of Maybank's appeal (Rule 41, Sec. 9). The issue of the correctness of the decision was now the subject of the perfected appeal.
*   **Abandonment of Appeal:** The Cordovas argued that Maybank abandoned its perfected appeal by filing a motion for reconsideration of the modified decision. The SC rejected this, stating that the Motion for Reconsideration and second notice merely manifested Maybank's "continuing desire to question the adverse decision" and do not constitute a waiver.
*   **Technicality vs. Merits:**  The SC emphasizes that appeals should not be dismissed on mere technicalities, citing *Pacific Life Assurance Corporation v. Sison*. All litigants must be afforded a "fullest opportunity" for adjudication on the merits.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Maybank:** Obligation to pursue its appeal on the merits in the CA.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Obligation to resolve the appeal on the merits, despite the procedural issues raised.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The CA had initially ruled against Maybank based on a perceived technicality. This underscores the risk of appeals being dismissed on procedural grounds.
*   The case highlights the importance of meticulously observing procedural rules, even when subsequent events might seem to render strict compliance less critical.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 41, Section 9 of the Rules of Court:** Perfection of Appeal; Effect Thereof
*   ***Pacific Life Assurance Corporation v. Sison***, 359 Phil. 332 (1998): Addressed the effect of not filing another Notice of Appeal when the decision, as modified, substantially increased petitioner's liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court did not find any contentious clauses. The only contentious issue was the interpretation of the rules on perfection of appeal and whether the first notice of appeal remained valid after the RTC's decision was modified.

**Overall:**

The SC ruled that Maybank's appeal was valid despite the subsequent modification of the RTC decision and Maybank's filing of a second notice of appeal. The CA was directed to resolve the appeal on its merits. The decision emphasizes the preference for resolving cases on their merits rather than dismissing them on technicalities. The issue of the day was technicalities regarding the second notice of appeal.
