## Legal Document Summary - *People v. YYY* (G.R. No. 234825)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal to the Supreme Court regarding the conviction of YYY for Qualified Rape (Crim. Case No. 10648) and his acquittal for another count of Qualified Rape (Crim. Case No. 10649), stemming from incidents allegedly occurring in 1993 and 2001, respectively, involving his daughter, AAA.  The CA affirmed the RTC conviction for the 1993 incident but acquitted YYY for the 2001 incident due to insufficient evidence.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Crim. Case No. 10648 (Qualified Rape - 1993 Incident):**
    *   **Conviction Upheld:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's conviction based on circumstantial evidence.
    *   **Elements of Rape (Art. 266-A(l)(a) RPC) & Qualified Rape (Art. 266-B(l) RPC) met:** Carnal knowledge, force/intimidation (rendering victim unconscious), minority of victim (15 years old), and offender's parental relation to the victim were established.
    *   **Circumstantial Evidence Relied Upon:**  Accused hitting victim's head with broom, victim's loss of consciousness, pain in vagina upon regaining consciousness, accused's threat to kill family, and corroborating medico-legal report indicating healed hymenal lacerations.
    *   **Delayed Reporting:** Delay in reporting was excused due to death threats by father and moral ascendancy over daughter. The court cited relevant jurisprudence regarding the delay in reporting rape incidents.
    *   **Defenses Rejected:** Alibi and denial are deemed weak and unsubstantiated.
    *   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole, plus civil indemnity (₱100,000), moral damages (₱100,000), and exemplary damages (₱100,000).  All monetary awards earn 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment.

*   **Crim. Case No. 10649 (Qualified Rape - 2001 Incident):** The SC upheld the CA's acquittal for this incident.

**Obligations:**

*   YYY is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay the specified damages.
*   The state has an obligation to provide due process and fair trial, while ensuring protection to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   YYY is criminally liable for Qualified Rape in Crim. Case No. 10648. He is also civilly liable to AAA for the awarded damages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction relies heavily on circumstantial evidence. While the court found it sufficient, it could be open to further legal challenges.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The core of the case hinges on the credibility of AAA's testimony.
*   **Medico-Legal Report:** The medico-legal report, while corroborating sexual intercourse, doesn't definitively pinpoint the 1993 incident. The doctor admitted the lacerations could have happened years prior to the examination.
*   **Lack of Direct Testimony:** The lack of direct testimony about the act of rape due to the victim's unconsciousness raises a potential challenge to the sufficiency of evidence.
