## Legal Document Summary: *Angelita Valdez v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 180863

This case concerns Angelita Valdez's petition for the declaration of presumptive death of her husband, Sofio Polborosa, to validate her subsequent marriage to Virgilio Reyes. The RTC dismissed the petition.

**Key Provisions and Rulings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the Family Code (Art. 41) or the Civil Code (Arts. 83, 390) applies to determine the validity of Valdez's second marriage.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that the Civil Code applies because Valdez's marriage to Sofio (1971) and to Reyes (1985) occurred before the Family Code's effectivity. Therefore, the stricter "well-founded belief" requirement of Art. 41 of the Family Code does not apply.
*   **Presumption of Death:** Under Art. 390 of the Civil Code, Sofio is presumed dead after seven years of absence (since October 1975), without news of his whereabouts or if he was alive. This presumption arose by operation of law.
*   **Validity of Second Marriage:** Because the presumption of Sofio's death arose in 1982, Valdez was capacitated to marry Reyes in 1985. The marriage to Reyes is declared legal and valid.
*   **Rejection of Petition:** While the Court affirmed the RTC's dismissal of the Petition, it did so on different grounds. The Court rejected the Petition because the presumption of death of her first husband occurred automatically through the provision of the Civil Code.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 83, 390 (presumption of death after seven years' absence).
*   **Family Code:** Article 41 (requiring "well-founded belief" in spouse's death for remarriage).
*   **_Jones v. Hortig√ºela_**: Reiterates the requirements for validity of second marriage when first spouse has disappeared without being declared as an absentee.
*   **_In re Szatraw_**: Establishes the principle that independent court petitions for declarations of presumption of death cannot be sustained under the Civil Code; it is merely a presumption.
*   **_Lukban v. Republic_**: Follows the rule that proceedings in court are not authorized for the presumption of death.
*   **_Gue v. Republic_**: Follows the rule in _Szatraw_ and _Lukban_ that there should not be any court proceedings to declare that a person is presumed dead.

**Obligations:**

*   There are no explicit ongoing obligations, as the central determination is the status of Valdez's marriage.

**Liabilities:**

*   No liabilities are created by this decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reappearance of Sofio:** Although the marriage to Reyes is declared valid, the reappearance of Sofio could raise legal questions regarding inheritance and marital property rights.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** While the presumption of death arose by operation of law, the absence of any formal notice or inquiry into Sofio's whereabouts might be challenged on due process grounds, although the court did not deem this as a necessary step in this case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "well-founded belief" provision under the Family Code was the central point of contention. The Court clarified that the relevant law at the time of the marriages governs.

**Overall, the Supreme Court clarified the application of the law and validated Valdez's second marriage. However, the inherent nature of a 'presumption' leaves open the theoretical possibility of future legal challenges should Sofio reappear.**
