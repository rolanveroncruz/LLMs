**Legal Document Summary: *Mactan Rock Industries, Inc. and Antonio Tompar vs. Benfrei S. Germo*, G.R. No. 228799**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's ruling which held Mactan Rock Industries, Inc. (MRII) and Antonio Tompar (President/CEO) solidarily liable for unpaid commissions, damages, and attorney's fees to Benfrei S. Germo arising from a Technical Consultancy Agreement (TCA).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **TCA (September 21, 2004):**  MRII engaged Germo as a marketing consultant; no employer-employee relationship; compensation on a purely commission basis plus a monthly allowance.
*   **ICTSI Contract:** Germo successfully negotiated a supply contract with ICTSI for MRII.
*   **Commissions:**  Germo claimed unpaid commissions of P4,499,412.84 from February 2007 to March 2012.

**Obligations:**

*   **MRII:**  Obligation to pay Germo agreed-upon commissions for the ICTSI contract.
*   **Germo:** Obligation to serve as marketing consultant and negotiate contracts.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Decision:**  MRII and Tompar held solidarily liable for unpaid commissions (P4,499,412.84), moral damages (P100,000.00), exemplary damages (P100,000.00), and attorney's fees (P50,000.00), plus interest.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC ruling.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** MRII solely liable for all damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdictional Argument:**  MRII and Tompar argued (belatedly) that the NLRC had jurisdiction due to an alleged employer-employee relationship.  The Court rejected this argument, citing the prohibition against raising new theories on appeal and considering the prior admission in the Answer.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* *Maxicare PCIB CIGNA Healthcare v. Contreras, 702 Phil. 688, 696 (2013).* This case discusses the prohibition of raising new theories on appeal.
*   **Legal Personality Argument:** MRII and Tompar argued (belatedly) that Germo lacked the legal personality to sue because he allegedly signed the TCA as a representative of another entity.  This was also rejected as a new theory and contradicting their earlier admission.
*   **Solidary Liability of Tompar:** The Supreme Court overturned the lower courts and deleted Tompar's solidary liability with MRII.  Citing that personal liability cannot be imposed on the CEO, director, or employee of a corporation unless a specific showing of negligence or bad faith that was not alleged in Germo's complaint.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* *Arco Pulp and Paper Co., Inc. v. Lim, 737 Phil. 137, 154 (2014)* This case requires the complainant to both allege and clearly prove such unlawful acts, negligence or bad faith.
*   **Interest Rate:** The court adjusted the legal interest to twelve percent (12%) per annum from judicial demand (filing of the complaint on February 28, 2011) until June 30, 2013, and thereafter, at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this Decision.
    *   *Relevant Case Law:* *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267, 278-283 (2013).* The Court cited this case in determining appropriate interest rates.
*   **Indigency Status/Lien:** Germo litigated as an indigent party.  The Court correctly imposed a lien on the monetary awards for appropriate filing fees.
    *   *Statutory Reference:* Section 21, Rule 3 and Section 19, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the liability of MRII for breach of the TCA and non-payment of commissions. However, the liability was not solidary as Tompar was not responsible under the specific context of the TCA. The key risk here was the potential imposition of personal liability on a corporate officer, which the SC corrected. MRII is liable for the specified amounts, plus adjusted interest, subject to a lien for unpaid filing fees. The initial admissions made by MRII in its Answer were legally binding and became a major factor in the Court's decision.
