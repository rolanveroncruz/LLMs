## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mercado (G.R. No. 218702)

**Document Type:** Philippine Supreme Court Decision (Appeal)
**Date:** October 17, 2018
**Citation:** 842 Phil. 327; 115 OG No. 26, 6266 (July 1, 2019)

**Parties:** People of the Philippines (Plaintiff-Appellee) v. Patrick John Mercado y Anticla (Accused-Appellant)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for Double Murder.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Patrick John Mercado guilty of Double Murder for the deaths of Alicia Mercado-Lusuriaga and Evelyn Santos.
*   **Dying Declaration:** The Court upheld the admissibility of Evelyn Santos' statements as a dying declaration under Rule 130, Section 37 of the Rules of Court. Key requisites are met, specifically focusing on Evelyn's belief in impending death (as inferred from the severity of her injuries) and statements concerning the cause and circumstances of her death. Cites *People v. Umapas* for the elements of dying declaration.
*   **Res Gestae:** Alternatively, Evelyn's statements are admissible as part of the *res gestae* under Rule 130, Section 42, given the startling event (fire, injuries, death), the spontaneity of the statements, and their relation to the incident. Cites *People v. Nartea* for the explanation of res gestae
*   **Defense of Denial Rejected:** Mercado's denial and the testimony of Dan Dacallos (witness stating he saw a bloodied man) were deemed insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence, particularly Evelyn's dying declarations.
*   **Qualifying Circumstance - Use of Fire Upheld:** The Court held that the Information sufficiently alleged the qualifying circumstance of "use of fire" despite not explicitly naming it as a qualifying circumstance. The information stated, "pour gasoline into their bodies and light them thereby causing upon them third degree burns." This, therefore, satisfies the requirement for due process and notice to the accused.
*   **No Voluntary Surrender:** The Court rejected Mercado's claim for the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. Mere non-resistance during arrest is not equivalent to a voluntary, spontaneous, and unconditional surrender. Cites *People v. Saul* for the elements of voluntary surrender.
*   **Penalty Modification:** The CA's modification of the penalty to two counts of *reclusion perpetua* was deemed incorrect. The Court reinstated the RTC's penalty of a single *reclusion perpetua* due to the crime being a complex crime of double murder; a single criminal act (arson) resulting in two deaths. Art. 48 RPC
*   **Damages Modified:** In accordance with *People v. Jugueta*, the Court modified the monetary awards to P100,000.00 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, and P50,000.00 for temperate damages, for each victim.
*   **Parole Ineligibility:** Due to the penalty of reclusion perpetua, Mercado is ineligible for parole under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9346.

**Obligations:**

*   Mercado is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Mercado is obligated to pay the specified damages to the heirs of the victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Double Murder.
*   Civil liability for damages resulting from the Double Murder.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Use of fire" as a Qualifying Circumstance:** Although the court holds that the Information sufficiently alleged the qualifying circumstance, this area could be subject to future challenge based on due process arguments (fair notice) if other Informations are similarly worded without explicitly stating the qualifying circumstance.
*   **Future Parole Changes:** Any future legislative changes impacting parole eligibility could affect Mercado's situation, though unlikely given the current statutory restriction.
