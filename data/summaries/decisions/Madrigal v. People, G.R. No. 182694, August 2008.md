## Legal Document Summary: *Igmidio Madrigal vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 182694

**Nature of the Document:** This is a Resolution from the Supreme Court of the Philippines partially granting a petition for review on certiorari concerning convictions for illegal possession of firearm (PD 1866 as amended by RA 8294) and violation of the Omnibus Election Code (Gun Ban, RA 7166).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Facts:** Petitioner was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm with live ammunition during the election period. He was charged and convicted by the RTC for both violations of PD 1866 (illegal firearm possession) and the Omnibus Election Code (gun ban).
*   **Issue:** Can a person be convicted for both illegal possession of firearm and violation of the election gun ban when the offenses arise from the same set of facts?
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for violation of the Omnibus Election Code (Gun Ban), but reversed the conviction for illegal possession of firearm (PD 1866 as amended by RA 8294).
*   **Legal Basis:** Section 1 of RA 8294 provides that a person cannot be convicted for illegal possession of firearm if another crime was committed (the Gun Ban violation in this case).
* **Obligations**: The primary legal obligations discussed revolve around compliance with laws related to firearm possession, particularly during election periods. These obligations fall on private individuals to ensure they are not in unlawful possession of firearms.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner remains liable for the penalty imposed for violating the Omnibus Election Code, including imprisonment and accessory penalties. He is relieved of the financial penalty (fine) and imprisonment stemming from the PD 1866 conviction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on RA 8294's "Proviso":** The outcome hinges on the interpretation of the proviso in RA 8294, Section 1: "Provided, That no other crime was committed." The Court interpreted this to mean that the illegal possession charge is subsumed by another crime committed simultaneously (in this case, violating the Omnibus Election Code).
*  **No actual ambiguities or contentious clauses identified as is, other than proper interpretation**

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1866 (as amended by RA 8294):** Law penalizing illegal possession of firearms. Specifically, the amended Section 1 dealing with unlawful possession of firearms, ammunition, etc.
*   **RA 7166 (Omnibus Election Code - Gun Ban):** Law prohibiting carrying firearms during the election period.
*   **RA 8294:** The amendment to PD 1866 is critical because it contains the provision preventing conviction for both illegal possession and another crime.
*   **_Agote v. Lorenzo_, G.R. No. 142675, 22 July 2005, 464 SCRA 60:** This case is cited as precedent for applying Section 1 of RA 8294 to set aside a conviction for illegal possession when another crime (violation of election gun ban) was committed.
*   **_Tan v. People of the Philippines_, G.R. No. 153460, 29 January 2007, 513 SCRA 194, 201-202:** Cited as a basis for the court to not disturb the factual finding of the lower courts, as long as there is no clear showing that the lower courts overlooked certain facts and circumstances which would substantially affect the disposition of the case

**Note:** This is a narrow application of RA 8294 tied directly to the simultaneous commission of another crime. This ruling reinforces that possession of an unlicensed firearm can still lead to conviction, but it could be vacated if another crime has been proven.
