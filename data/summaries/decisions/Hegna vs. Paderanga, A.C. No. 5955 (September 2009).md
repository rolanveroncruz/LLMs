## Legal Document Summary: *Hegna v. Paderanga*, A.C. No. 5955

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Goering G.C. Paderanga for alleged falsification of documents and ethical violations.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant Hegna obtained a favorable judgment in a forcible entry case (Civil Case No. R-45146) against Spouses Panaguinip.
*   Respondent Paderanga, allegedly acting on behalf of the Spouses Panaguinip, filed an Affidavit of Third-Party Claim asserting ownership over properties levied for execution of the judgment, based on Deeds of Absolute Sale from the Spouses.
*   Hegna alleged irregularities in the deeds, including discrepancies in notarization and the failure of Paderanga to register the transfers, leading to a delay in the execution of the judgment.
*   Hegna filed a criminal complaint for falsification against Paderanga, dismissed for lack of *prima facie* evidence.
*   IBP found Paderanga in violation of the Canons of Professional Responsibility, particularly Article 1491 of the Civil Code, prohibiting lawyers from acquiring property subject to litigation in which they participate.

**Key Provisions/Obligations Violated:**

*   **Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Mandates lawyers to support the Constitution, obey laws, and refrain from falsehoods.
*   **Article 1491 of the Civil Code:** Prohibits lawyers from acquiring by purchase, either in person or through the mediation of another, the property and rights which may be the object of any litigation in which they may take part by virtue of their profession.
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.02 Code of Professional Responsibility**: Refraining from counseling or abetting activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.

**Liabilities/Sanctions:**

*   The Supreme Court found Paderanga guilty of engaging in dishonest and deceitful conduct.
*   Paderanga was **suspended from the practice of law for one (1) year.**

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Falsification:** While Hegna alleged falsification, this was not conclusively proven. The Court based its decision primarily on Paderanga's *conduct* surrounding the transactions and his failure to register the properties, inferring a dishonest intent and violation of ethical duties.
*   **Acquisition of Property in Litigation:** The crucial issue is whether the purported sale to Paderanga was a legitimate transaction or a scheme to evade the judgment. The Court's finding hinges on the IBP Investigating Commissioner's belief that the transfer documents were irregular and the Affidavit of Third Party Claim was simulated.
*   **Estate Planning Defense:** Paderanga's defense of legitimate estate planning to justify the non-registration of sale was unsuccessful and construed as an intent to defraud the government of taxes.
*   **Application of Article 1491:** The determination of whether the properties were considered "in litigation" at the time of the alleged transfer is critical. The Court considered it so since the properties became subject to judicial execution.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension.
*   **Article 1491 of the Civil Code:** Prohibition on certain persons acquiring property involved in litigation.
*   *Spouses Donato v. Asuncion, Sr.*, A.C. No. 4914: cited as precedent for suspending lawyers for misconduct.
*   *Yap-Paras v. Paras*, A.C. No. 4947: cited as precedent for suspending lawyers for making falsehoods.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case demonstrates the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny of lawyers' conduct, both professional and private. The Court is willing to infer dishonest intent from questionable transactions, even in the absence of conclusive proof of falsification, when such conduct violates ethical duties and undermines the integrity of the legal system. Paderanga's failure to register the properties, coupled with the timing of the transactions and the irregularities surrounding the Deeds of Sale, created a strong inference of a scheme to evade the judgment, justifying his suspension.
