**Legal Document Summary: *Najarro v. Jarson Development Corporation* (G.R. Nos. 142627 & 172750)**

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 concerning a construction dispute and related damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Agreement to Reconstruct:** Respondents (JDC, Mabugat, and Galang) agreed via court order (July 11, 1994) to reconstruct petitioners' (Najarro family) damaged residential building, restore the caved-in foundation, and pay for any damages arising from defects or collapse. This agreement superseded the initial injunction request. This order was based on agreement between the parties to dispense with the issue of injunction.
*   **Liability Clause:** Respondents bound themselves jointly and severally to pay for any damage in case of any defect in the construction of petitionersâ€™ residence and/or the collapse or any damage thereof as a result and by reason of the foundation or condition of the soil.
*   **Damage Awards:** Trial court initially awarded moral damages (P500,000), exemplary damages (P200,000), attorney's fees (P50,000), litigation expenses (P5,000), and ordered the reconstruction/restoration work. The Court of Appeals later reduced the moral damages to P300,000.
*   **Finality of Judgement:** The ruling tackles the issue of when the judgement became final and executory. The Court of Appeals deemed that the finality was achieved despite Respondent's claims that they did not receive a copy of the decision, and therefore the period to appeal was still ongoing.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents have an obligation to fully restore the foundation, reconstruct the building, and secure the necessary permits.
*   Respondents have a monetary obligation to pay damages, as modified by the appellate court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Joint and several liability exists amongst the respondents (JDC, Mabugat, and Galang) for the financial damages awarded.
*   Potential liability for further damages if the reconstruction is defective or causes further harm.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Issues:** Ensuring full compliance with the reconstruction order could be problematic.
*   **Continuing Liability:** The "any defect" clause could lead to future claims if issues arise post-reconstruction.
*   **Appeal Issues:** The main issue is whether the judgement was finalized and executory

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Engineering Construction Inc. v. NPC, 163 SCRA 9 (1988); Valencia v. CA, 184 SCRA 561 (1990); Echauz v. CA, 199 SCRA 381 (1991); RCPI v. Lantin, [985]:** Cited by the Court of Appeals when denying petitioners' motion for execution pending appeal, specifically relating to moral damages.
*   **Section 3, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court:** Failure to notify the court of a change of address.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Any defect in the construction":** This phrase lacks specificity and could be interpreted broadly, potentially leading to future disputes over the scope of liability.
*   The Respondents' legal counsel failing to notify the court of the change of address.

**Summary Judgment:** The Supreme Court denied both petitions. In G.R. No. 142627, the petition was moot. In G.R. No. 172750, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision deeming the case final and executory, citing negligence of counsel as the finality of judgment issue. The original decision against Jarson Development Corp. stands.
