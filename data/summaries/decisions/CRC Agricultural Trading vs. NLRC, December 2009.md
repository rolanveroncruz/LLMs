## Legal Document Summary - *CRC Agricultural Trading v. NLRC and Obias* (G.R. No. 177664)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's decision which reversed the NLRC and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's ruling finding Roberto Obias illegally dismissed by CRC Agricultural Trading and Rolando Catindig. The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court affirmed the existence of an employer-employee relationship based on the four-fold test: (1) selection and engagement, (2) payment of wages, (3) power of dismissal, and (4) control of employee's conduct. (Citing *Chavez v. NLRC*, 489 Phil. 444 (2005)).
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Obias was deemed illegally dismissed.
*   **Abandonment:** The Court found no abandonment of work by Obias. Abandonment requires (1) failure to report for work without valid reason and (2) clear intent to sever the employer-employee relationship. The employer bears the burden of proof. (Citing *Pentagon Steel Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 174141, June 26, 2009). Obias filing a complaint for illegal dismissal negated abandonment.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Obias was constructively dismissed. Constructive dismissal occurs when continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable, or unlikely, forcing the employee to resign.
*   **Due Process:** Petitioners failed to comply with the twin-notice requirement for termination. The employer must provide two written notices: (1) a notice of the grounds for dismissal and (2) a notice of the employer's decision to dismiss. (Citing *Mendoza v. NLRC*, 350 Phil. 486 (1998)).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Backwages:** CRC Agricultural Trading and Rolando Catindig are liable for full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other benefits, from the date of dismissal to the finality of the decision. (Art. 279, Labor Code).
*   **Separation Pay:** Due to strained relations, reinstatement is not feasible. Therefore, separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service from engagement to the finality of the decision is awarded.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded at 10% of the total monetary award. (Citing *Macasero v. Southern Industrial Gases Philippines*, G.R. No. 178524, January 30, 2009).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Monetary Computation:** The exact monetary award requires computation based on the respondent's salary, allowances, and years of service. The case was remanded to the Labor Arbiter solely for this purpose.
*   **"No Work, No Pay" Argument:** The Court dismissed the "no work, no pay" argument as merely a method of computing compensation and not a basis to negate the employer-employee relationship.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Art. 282(b) of the Labor Code (just cause for termination - neglect of duty related to abandonment).
*   Art. 279 of the Labor Code (remedies for illegal dismissal - reinstatement and backwages).

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   Strained relationship between the parties which makes reinstatement no longer an option. This could lead to disputes about what exactly strained relations means.
