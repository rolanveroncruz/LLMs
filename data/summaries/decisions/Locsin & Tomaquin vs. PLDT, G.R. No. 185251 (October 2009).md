## Legal Document Summary: *Locsin v. PLDT* (G.R. No. 185251)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting the CA decision that reversed NLRC's ruling of illegal dismissal against PLDT.

**Key Issue:** Whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Raul Locsin & Eddie Tomaquin (Petitioners/Security Guards) and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (Respondent/PLDT) *after* the termination of the Security Services Agreement (Agreement) between PLDT and Security and Safety Corporation of the Philippines (SSCP).

**Background:**

*   Petitioners were initially assigned to PLDT by SSCP under a valid Security Services Agreement.
*   PLDT terminated the Agreement with SSCP, effective October 1, 2001.
*   Petitioners continued to provide security services at PLDT's premises until September 30, 2002.
*   Petitioners were then terminated and filed for illegal dismissal and monetary claims against PLDT.

**Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, finding that an employer-employee relationship existed between the Petitioners and PLDT *after* the termination of the Agreement. CA decision was reversed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agreement Termination:** The Agreement between PLDT and SSCP was terminated, absolving SSCP of contractual obligations *except* to former employees who served PLDT.
*   **Post-Termination Service:** Petitioners continued to work at PLDT premises *after* the agreement ended.
*   **Control Test:** The Supreme Court emphasized the "control test" as the most important indicator of an employer-employee relationship, citing *Tongko v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.* It focused on PLDT's *de facto* control over the Petitioners, inferring that PLDT instructed them to remain at their posts.
*   **Art. 106, Labor Code and DO 18-02:** While initially SSCP was an independent contractor, post termination, the Court used Art. 106 and DO 18-02 as support. It pointed to a situation analogous to labor-only contracting wherein PLDT exercised direct control of the employees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PLDT:** Liable for illegal dismissal due to its failure to observe due process requirements prior to termination.  Must pay separation pay and back wages as per the Labor Arbiter's decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence & Inference:** The Court's finding of control relies heavily on circumstantial evidence and inferences, particularly the fact that Petitioners continued to work at PLDT's premises *without* a clear contractual basis after the agreement was terminated.
*   **PLDT's Failure to Act:** The court emphasizes that PLDT failed to explain why these former contracted employees were not removed from their post following the termination of the contract.
*   **Dissenting Arguments:** The CA placed weight on the previous relationship, lack of evidence of payments being made directly by PLDT, and no formal contract directly engaging the employees. These factors could be points of contention should the issue be taken further.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Abella v. PLDT:** Distinguishes the period *before* the Agreement termination, where no employer-employee relationship existed.
*   **Tongko v. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. (Phils.) Inc.:** Reinforces the importance of the "control test."
*   **Lee Eng Hong v. Court of Appeals:** Emphasizes the requirement of credibility in evidence.
*   **Article 106 of the Labor Code:** Addresses contractor or subcontractor liability.
*   **Department Order No. 18-2002:** Implementing rules of Art. 106 and defining labor-only contracting.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(y) of the Rules of Court:** Used to establish presumption of ordinary course of business.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of clear evidence regarding *who* directed the Petitioners to remain at their posts and *who* ultimately paid their salaries after the Agreement termination created ambiguity that the Court resolved by drawing inferences against PLDT.
