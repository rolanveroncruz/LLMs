**Nature:** Administrative case against Atty. Cesar V. Lledo, Branch Clerk of Court, RTC Quezon City, for immorality, abandonment, and conduct unbecoming a public official.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Immorality & Abandonment:**  Respondent found to have abandoned his wife and legitimate children and cohabited with Katrina Narvaez, with whom he had children, without the benefit of marriage.
*   **False Representation:** Respondent falsely represented Katrina Narvaez as his wife in a sworn affidavit (Exhibit J).
*   **Lack of Support:**  Implicit finding of inadequate support for legitimate children despite respondent's claims to the contrary.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Duty to Maintain Good Name of Judiciary:** Respondent failed in his duty to uphold the prestige and integrity of the judiciary through his conduct, both official and personal.
*   **Obligations to Legitimate Family:**  Respondent failed in his fundamental obligations to his wife and children (support, fidelity).
*   **Compliance with R.A. 6713:** Respondent violated the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   **Dismissal from Service:** Dismissed from his position as Branch Clerk of Court, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in government.
*   **Referral to IBP:**  Case referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for disciplinary proceedings under Rule 139-B, Section 1, as the conduct also affects his fitness as a member of the bar.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** While the Court found the complainant's evidence more credible, the respondent denied the allegations, leading to a factual dispute resolved against him.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The case was decided based on the standard of proof required in administrative proceedings (substantial evidence), which is lower than that in criminal cases.
*   **IBP Proceedings:** The IBP may initiate separate disciplinary proceedings that could result in suspension or disbarment.
*   **Due Process:** While the court record claims that the defendant had been given an opportunity to present the evidence and cross-examine, defense counsel may dispute the credibility of the process.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (P.D. 807) & R.A. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Cited as the statutory bases for the complaint.
*   **Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court:**  Basis for referral to the IBP.
*   **Case Law on Morality and Conduct of Court Personnel:** The decision relies heavily on precedent establishing the high standard of conduct required of judiciary employees, citing cases such as *Sicat v. Alcantara*, *Castillo v. Calanog*, *Dy Teban Hardware & Auto Supply v. Tapucar*, and others.
*   ***Gacho v. Fuentes,* AM No. P-98-1265, June 29, 1998** is cited multiple times as supporting precedent that supports the duty to maintain good name of judiciary
*   ***Flores v. Caniya, 256 SCRA 518, April 26, 1996; Office of the Court Administrator v. Fuentes et al., AM No. RTJ-94-1270, August 23, 1995; Ong v. Meregildo, 233 SCRA 632, July 5, 1994; GVM, Inc. v. De Guzman, 227 SCRA 684, November 11, 1993.*** further supports the ruling of the duty to maintain good name of judiciary.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Adequate Support":** The determination of whether the respondent provided "adequate support" is somewhat subjective and relies on factual findings. While the decision asserts inadequate support, the specific details of support provided (or not provided) could be further scrutinized.
