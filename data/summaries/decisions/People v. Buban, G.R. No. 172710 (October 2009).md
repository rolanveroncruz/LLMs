**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Buban*, G.R. No. 172710, October 9, 2009**

This is an automatic review of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Alberto Buban for four counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659). The victim, AAA, was found to be a minor at the time of the offenses.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Four counts of rape committed on October 12, 1995; November 15, 1995; January 29, 1996; and February 24, 1996.
*   **Elements of Rape:** The Court affirms that the prosecution successfully proved carnal knowledge of a woman through force and intimidation, which were all present in the case.
*   **Victim's Credibility:** The Court upheld the lower courts' assessment that AAA's testimony was credible, consistent, and unwavering.
*   **Force and Intimidation:** The Court found the force and intimidation used by accused-appellant sufficient to consummate the rapes, given the disparity in age and physical strength between the parties.
*   **Defense's Argument:** The defense's claim of consensual intercourse due to a "sweetheart" relationship was rejected for lack of substantiating evidence.
*   **Failure to Immediately Report:** Delay in reporting the rapes was excused due to threats of physical violence.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Alberto Buban):**
    *   Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt on four counts of rape.
    *   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count.
    *   Ordered to pay P200,000 as civil indemnity and P200,000 as moral damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility Issues:** While the courts found the victim's testimony credible, rape cases often hinge on the victim's credibility, which can be a point of contention.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The case relies heavily on testimonial evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The Court cited and applied the jurisprudential guidelines for reviewing rape cases as articulated in *People v. Nazareno* (G.R. No. 167756, April 9, 2008).
*   The Court also cited and applied the jurisprudence that established delay in reporting rape because of threats of physical violence should not be taken against the victim.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659) defines rape and its penalties.
*   Section 11 of Rule 110, Rules of Court, addresses the date of commission of offense.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of the victim due to the "sweetheart" claims. The failure of the defense to prove this claim and the victim's testimonies disproving the claim was a major issue on appeal.
