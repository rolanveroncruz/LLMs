## Legal Document Summary: *Giduquio v. People*, G.R. No. 165927

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing Sandiganbayan conviction for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Parties:** Ernesto Z. Giduquio (Petitioner/Accused) vs. People of the Philippines (Respondent/Prosecution).

**Key Issue:** Whether Giduquio, as Vice-President and Manager of Small Island Grid, National Power Corporation (NPC), violated Section 3(e) of RA 3019 by awarding *pakiao* contracts without public bidding and causing payment despite construction deficiencies.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Initially found Giduquio guilty of awarding contracts without public bidding and causing payment despite deficiencies but acquitted him on other charges (splitting contracts, inflating cost estimates). Sentenced to imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the Sandiganbayan's decision and acquitted Giduquio.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** The core of the case. Requires proof of undue injury to the government *or* unwarranted benefit/advantage/preference given to a private party, *coupled with* manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Dispensing with Public Bidding:** SC held that public bidding was reasonably dispensed with due to the power crisis urgency (citing *Purefoods v. Court of Appeals*). Defense witness Agtarap corroborated this justification.
*   **Giduquio's Participation in Awarding Contracts:** SC emphasized that Giduquio did not participate in the award of the *pakiao* contracts, as those were prepared and awarded by the Head Office. His superior, Mr. Ramas, signed the contracts.
*   **Premature Payment:** SC deemed the payment justifiable because construction was substantially complete (99%) and the workers gave a Letter of Guarantee to finish the small outstanding balance.
*   **Lack of Manifest Partiality/Bad Faith:** SC found no evidence of manifest partiality or bad faith. Instead, Giduquio acted out of sympathy for the workers, imposing safeguards. Cites *Sistoza v. Desierto* regarding the required level of evidence for partiality/bad faith.
*   **No Undue Injury:** Even with some deficiencies, the construction was eventually completed, showing no actual injury to the government.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks (if the SC had affirmed):**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) month as minimum, up to ten (10) years and one (1) month as maximum, under RA 3019.
*   **Perpetual Disqualification from Public Office:** A severe consequence barring future government employment.
*   **Potential Civil Liability:** Although not assessed in this case due to lack of evidence, civil liability for damages could have been imposed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   ***Purefoods v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 128069:** Cited for the context of the power crisis.
*   ***Sistoza v. Desierto, et al*, G.R. No. 144784:**  Key case establishing that "mere" bad faith or partiality is not sufficient; it must be "evident" or "manifest."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses (resolved in Petitioner's favor):**

*   **Necessity of Public Bidding:** The prosecution argued for mandatory public bidding, while the defense successfully argued for the "urgency exception".
*   **Justification for Early Payment:** The prosecution alleged premature payment as evidence of corruption, but the defense successfully demonstrated substantial completion and mitigating factors.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court overturned the conviction due to the lack of sufficient evidence to prove manifest partiality, bad faith, or undue injury, highlighting the crucial elements required for a conviction under Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
