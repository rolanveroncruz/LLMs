## Legal Document Summary: People v. Manansala (G.R. No. 229092)

**Nature:** Ordinary appeal assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC's conviction of Manansala for Illegal Sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165) and Illegal Possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165) of dangerous drugs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sections 5 & 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Define and penalize illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, respectively. These are the statutes under which Manansala was charged.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):**  Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value. Requires immediate physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media and the DOJ, and an elected public official. Drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Saving Clause (IRR of RA 9165, now codified by RA 10640):**  Non-compliance with Section 21 is not fatal if the prosecution proves justifiable grounds for non-compliance and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for both offenses. Specifically, must prove:
    *   *Illegal Sale:*  Identity of buyer, seller, object (drugs), consideration (money), delivery of drugs, and payment.
    *   *Illegal Possession:* Accused possessed prohibited drug; possession unauthorized by law; accused freely and consciously possessed the drug.
    *   Most importantly: unbroken chain of custody and proper preservation of the drugs' integrity.
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165 or providing justifiable reasons for non-compliance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-compliance with Section 21:** The prosecution failed to demonstrate strict compliance with Section 21. Crucially, the inventory and photography of seized items were not done in the presence of the required representatives (DOJ, media, elected official). No inventory nor photographs were submitted in court.
*   **Insufficient Justification for Deviations:** The provided justifications for non-compliance (i.e., "commotion," lack of camera) were deemed insufficient and lacked specific details to excuse the procedural lapses.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** Unjustified deviations from Section 21 raised significant doubts regarding the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   **Evidentiary Value of Barangay Blotter:** The Court explicitly states that a barangay blotter cannot substitute for a physical inventory. Its entries are only prima facie evidence.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  Basis for the charges.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):** Codified the "saving clause" from the IRR of RA 9165, allowing for deviations from Sec. 21 under certain conditions.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):**  Highlights the importance of the presence of representatives from media, DOJ, or elected public officials to prevent evidence tampering.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** States that for the saving clause to apply, the prosecution must explain procedural lapses, and that integrity of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):**  Emphasizes that justifiable grounds for non-compliance must be proven as fact, not presumed.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):**  Sec. 21 RA 9165, is substantive law.
*   **People v. Go, 457 Phil. 885 (2003):** Court supports government campaign against drug addiction, but compulsions of the Bill of Rights must be equally observed.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Manansala due to the prosecution's failure to adequately establish an unbroken chain of custody and provide sufficient justification for non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
