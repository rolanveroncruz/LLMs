## Legal Document Summary: Reyes v. Samsung Electronic Phils. Corp.

**Case:** G.R. No. 258269, April 15, 2024

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Jose Antonio Paulo I. Reyes (former WLAN Head/National Sales Manager)
*   **Respondents:** Samsung Electronic Phils. Corp. (Samsung), Kevin Lee, Minsu Chu, and Silver Fungo (officers of Samsung)

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the NLRC's ruling that Reyes was validly dismissed from his *probationary* employment for failing to meet reasonable standards for regularization.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the CA's decision. Reyes was deemed validly dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Probationary Employment:** Reyes was hired on a probationary basis with an agreed-upon monthly salary. A "Probationary Contract of Employment" was signed.
*   **Regularization Standards:** The central point of contention is whether Samsung adequately communicated the reasonable standards for regularization to Reyes *at the time of his engagement*. Art. 296 (formerly 281) of the Labor Code requires standards be communicated to the probationary employee at the time of the engagement.
*   **Performance Evaluation:** Samsung terminated Reyes' employment citing failure to meet performance standards, as indicated in his "Performance Evaluation Form," resulting in a "needs improvement" rating.
*   **13th Month Pay:** Samsung was ordered to pay Reyes proportionate 13th month pay, as provided in his employment contract.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal Claim (Reyes):** Reyes claimed illegal dismissal, seeking reinstatement, backwages, damages, and attorney's fees. This claim was *dismissed*.
*   **Samsung's Defense:** Samsung argued Reyes was informed of standards, failed to meet them (qualitative and quantitative), and his termination was justified even if he were a regular employee due to loss of trust and confidence. Samsung was ultimately successful in defending against the illegal dismissal claim.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Samsung avoided liability for illegal dismissal by demonstrating (to the satisfaction of the LA, NLRC, and CA) that it communicated the standards for regularization, even if those standards included implied or inherent criteria related to managerial positions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 296 (Probationary Employment):**  Establishes the requirements for valid probationary employment, specifically the communication of reasonable standards for regularization *at the time of engagement*. Failure to meet this requirement results in regular employment.
*   **Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, Sec. 6(d), Book VI, Rule I:** Reinforces the requirement that regularization standards be made known to the employee *at the time of engagement*.
*   **Montoya v. Transmed (613 Phil. 696 (2009)):** Discusses the scope of review under Rule 45, limiting it to questions of law unless grave abuse of discretion is shown.
*   **Abbott Laboratories, Phils. v. Alcaraz (714 Phil. 510 (2013)):**  Addresses the standard for probationary employees and the implied standard based on the performance of one's job. Notes that the standard for regularization need not be enumerated or specified in every case if adequate performance of one's duties serves as an inherent and implied standard for a probationary employee to be regularized.
*   **Moral v. Momentum Properties Management Corp. (848 Phil. 621 (2019)):** Discusses security of tenure for probationary employees and the employer's right to determine suitability for permanent employment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Communication of Standards:** Whether Samsung *actually* communicated the regularization standards to Reyes at the time of engagement was the central point of contention. Reyes argued that it was not done, resulting in the allegation that his employment was regular from the start.
*   **Implied Standards:** Samsung's argument that certain "qualitative" standards (leadership, professionalism) were inherent in the National Sales Manager position and did not need to be explicitly communicated to Reyes.
*   **Applicability of Two-Notice Rule:** The lower courts determined that the two-notice rule doesn't apply to probationary employees terminated for failing to meet regularization standards, unlike regular employees terminated for cause.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidentiary Burden:** The employer bears the burden of proving that reasonable standards were communicated to the employee at the time of engagement. Weak or ambiguous evidence in this regard can expose the employer to liability for illegal dismissal.
*   **Specificity of Standards:** Vague or subjective performance standards may be challenged as unreasonable or discriminatory.
*   **Due Process:** Potential challenges based on a lack of due process if a probationary employee is not given a fair opportunity to understand and address performance deficiencies.

**Dissenting Opinion (Kho, Jr., J.):**

*   Argued the standards were not adequately communicated to Reyes and that the one-notice rule is unconstitutional and goes against the constitutional protection to labor.
*   Argued Reyes's right to due process was violated as he was not given an opportunity to be heard regarding his alleged failure to meet the standards for regularization.
