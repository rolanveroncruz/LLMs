## Legal Document Summary: RTG Construction, Inc. vs. Roberto Facto

**Case:** G.R. No. 163872, December 21, 2009 (623 Phil. 511)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** RTG Construction, Inc. and/or Rolito Go/Russet Construction and Development Corporation
*   **Respondent:** Roberto Facto

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding an illegal dismissal complaint.

**Key Issue:** Whether Roberto Facto's dismissal was illegal and whether he is entitled to backwages, separation pay, service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay and attorney's fees.

**CA Holding:** Modified the Labor Arbiter's decision by declaring Facto's dismissal *legal*, but still awarded him backwages, 13th-month pay, service incentive leave pay, and attorney's fees. Remanded to Labor Arbiter for computation.

**Supreme Court Holding:** **Partly Granted** the petition. Affirmed the CA decision except for the award of backwages. Instead, the SC ordered petitioners to pay Facto nominal damages of P30,000.00 for failure to observe procedural due process.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Procedural Due Process (Labor Code & Implementing Rules):** The core of the case hinges on the employer's failure to comply with procedural due process requirements for termination. Specifically, the lack of a first notice specifying the grounds for termination and a reasonable opportunity for the employee to explain his side, present evidence, and rebut charges. *See* Section 2(d), Rule 1, Book VI of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code. The employer must furnish the employee two written notices before termination may be effected. *Herminigildo Inguillo v. First Philippine Scales, Inc., et al., G.R. No. 165407, June 5, 2009*.
*   **Just Cause:** The CA found the dismissal to be based on just cause (employee's infraction of company rules on August 9, 2000).
*   **Service Incentive Leave Pay (Labor Code Art. 95):** An employee with at least one year of service is entitled to a yearly incentive leave of five days with pay.
*   **13th Month Pay (PD 851):** An employee whose services are terminated is entitled to 13th month pay proportionate to the time worked during the year.
*   **Attorney's Fees (Labor Code Art. 111; Civil Code Art. 2208):** Awarded when an employee is forced to litigate to protect his rights and interests in actions for recovery of wages.
*   **Nominal Damages (Agabon v. NLRC, 485 Phil. 248 (2004)):** Where a dismissal is for just cause but lacks procedural due process, backwages are not awarded. Instead, nominal damages are assessed at the court's discretion.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTG Construction, Inc. and/or Rolito Go/Russet Construction and Development Corporation:** Liable jointly and severally for the nominal damages (P30,000.00), service incentive leave pay, 13th month pay, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Payment:** The employer failed to provide sufficient proof of payment for service incentive leave pay and 13th-month pay. In cases of nonpayment of claims, the burden of proof rests on the employer to prove payment rather than on the employee to prove nonpayment. *Mantle Trading Services, Inc. and/or Bobby del Rosario v. NLRC and Pablo S. Madriaga, G.R. No. 166705, July 28, 2009*.
*   **Computation of Monetary Awards:** The CA remanded the case to the Labor Arbiter for computation. The specific amounts due for service incentive leave pay and 13th-month pay are subject to computation and may be contentious.
*   **Good faith is irrelevant in wage cases:** The court emphasizes that attorney's fees can be awarded even if the employer did not act maliciously or in bad faith when withholding wages.
*   **Abandonment of Serrano Doctrine:** This case highlights the shift from Serrano's ruling on backwages in procedural due process cases, adopting Agabon's nominal damages approach instead.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines:** Articles 95 (Service Incentive Leave), 111 (Attorney's Fees).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 851:** 13th Month Pay Law.
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Article 2208 (Attorney's Fees).
*   **Agabon v. NLRC, 485 Phil. 248 (2004):** Established the doctrine of nominal damages for dismissals with just cause but lacking procedural due process.
*   **Herminigildo Inguillo v. First Philippine Scales, Inc., et al., G.R. No. 165407, June 5, 2009**
*   **Mantle Trading Services, Inc. and/or Bobby del Rosario v. NLRC and Pablo S. Madriaga, G.R. No. 166705, July 28, 2009**

**Conclusion:**

The court upheld the legality of the dismissal but penalized the employer for procedural lapses in its termination process by awarding nominal damages to the employee. The employer is also liable for unpaid service incentive leave and 13th-month pay, as well as attorney's fees, as it failed to prove that it had paid these amounts. The critical takeaway is the strict adherence to procedural due process in termination cases, even when just cause for termination exists.
