## Legal Document Summary: Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc. (G.R. No. 174116)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision which held Eastern Shipping Lines (ESL) solely liable for damages to a shipment of Nissan auto parts insured by Prudential Guarantee (PGA). PGA, as subrogee of Nissan, sued ESL and Asian Terminals, Inc (ATI) for reimbursement after paying Nissan's claim for damages. The CA exonerated ATI.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Shipment Contract:** ESL, as carrier, was responsible for the safe delivery of the cargo from Nagoya, Japan to Manila.
*   **Insurance Policy:** PGA insured the shipment under Marine Open Policy No. 86-168 and Marine Cargo Risk Note No. 3921/95. (However, the Marine Insurance Policy itself was not presented as evidence)
*   **Subrogation:** PGA claims the right to subrogation to Nissan's rights against ESL due to the insurance payout.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial RTC Ruling:**  RTC initially held ESL and ATI jointly and solidarily liable to PGA for the damages, attorney's fees and costs.
*   **CA Ruling:** CA held ESL solely liable for the loss of the cargo, deleting attorneyâ€™s fees and dismissing the complaint against ATI.
*   **SC Ruling:** SC reversed the CA decision and dismissed the complaint against ESL.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Presentation of Marine Insurance Policy:** The core issue is the failure of PGA to present the actual Marine Insurance Policy (No. 86-168) at trial. The SC emphasizes that the Marine Cargo Risk Note alone is insufficient to prove PGA's right of subrogation.
    *   The Risk Note (issued on the arrival date) raises questions about whether the cargo was insured *during the voyage*.
    *   Crucially, the terms of the Marine Open Policy, alluded to in the Risk Note (Institute Cargo Clauses "A" and other conditions), are unknown without the Policy itself, making it impossible to determine if PGA complied with the insurance prerequisites.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of Subrogation:** The SC relies on *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.* and *Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. v. Prudential Guarantee & Assurance, Inc.* emphasizing that establishing the legal basis for subrogation requires presenting the insurance contract. The absence of this contract is a fatal flaw in PGA's case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari, generally limited to questions of law.
*   **Section 7, Rule 9 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Requires that when an action is based on a written instrument, the instrument or a copy thereof shall be attached to the pleading.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Philippine American General Insurance Co.* (nature of marine risk note).
    *   *International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. FGU Insurance Corporation* (nature of marine risk note and exceptions to the marine insurance policy presentation requirement).
    *   *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.* (critical case regarding the necessity of presenting the marine insurance policy and actionable documents).
    *   *Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. v. Prudential Guarantee & Assurance, Inc.* (further emphasized need to present insurance contract to determine extent of coverage for subrogation).
    *   *Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals* (Exception where loss occured while on board the petioner's vessel).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The terms and conditions of the Marine Open Policy No. 86-168 referenced in the Marine Cargo Risk Note, which are crucial in determining the extent of coverage and compliance therewith.
*   The date and time when the alleged insurance contract was constituted (i.e., Marine Open Policy) is missing from the Marine Cargo Risk Note.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The primary risk is the lack of a valid claim for subrogation due to PGA's failure to present the Marine Insurance Policy. Without the policy, the Court cannot determine if PGA had a legitimate basis to pay Nissan's claim and subsequently seek reimbursement from ESL.
*   Estoppel may have been argued if the case were not reversed, as it seemed ESL was not remiss to open objections during the RTC hearing, and it failed to insist in presenting the marine policy.

**Conclusion:**

The SC correctly reversed the CA decision because PGA failed to adequately prove its right to subrogation. The non-presentation of the Marine Insurance Policy is a critical evidentiary deficiency that undermines PGA's entire claim. While the Marine Cargo Risk Note establishes a potential insurance relationship, it is insufficient without the underlying policy to define the scope of coverage, the policy's terms and conditions, and evidence of compliance. *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.* is a key precedent supporting this conclusion. ESL is ultimately not liable due to PGA's failure to meet its burden of proof.
