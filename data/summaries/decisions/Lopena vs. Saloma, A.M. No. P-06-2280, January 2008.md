**Legal Document Summary: _Lopena v. Saloma_ A.M. No. P-06-2280**

**Nature:** Disciplinary administrative case against Mary Jane L. Saloma, Clerk of Court IV, MTC Marikina City, for dishonesty and misrepresentation, stemming from allegations of misrepresentation as a lawyer, unethical behavior, and unauthorized absences during office hours to attend personal hearings.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Dishonesty Claim Dismissed:** The Court found no cogent proof to support the claim that Saloma misrepresented herself as a lawyer, thus the scope of the investigation was limited.
*   **Unauthorized Absences (Loafing):** Saloma was found guilty of loafing â€“ unauthorized absences from duty during regular office hours (specifically, attending barangay and prosecutor hearings for personal cases). This violates Rule IV Section 52 A(17) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service or CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19-99.
*   **No Valid Justification:** Her claims of making up the time later or receiving permission from the Executive Judge were deemed insufficient. Saloma did not properly apply for leave nor reflect absences on her time card. Section 9 Rule XVII of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 prohibits offsetting of tardiness or absence by working beyond regular hours.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 2-99 (Saturday Duty):** Her attempted justification for a half-day absence (June 20, 2006) as an offset for Saturday duty (June 17, 2006) was found to be non-compliant with the specific requirements outlined in Administrative Circular No. 2-99 regarding prior approval and full day off.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty to devote official time to government service.
*   Obligation to adhere to Civil Service Rules regarding office hours and leave applications.
*   Obligation to strictly observe prescribed office hours.

**Liabilities:**

*   Found guilty of loafing/frequent unauthorized absences.

**Penalty:**

*   Suspension for three (3) months without pay.
*   Severe warning against future repetition of similar acts.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule IV Section 52 A(17) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service or CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19-99:** Defines the offense of loafing and its penalties.
*   **Section 9, Rule XVII of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** Prohibits offsetting tardiness or absence by working additional hours.
*   **Section 1, Rule XVII of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** Requires proper leave application and time card notations for absences during office hours for non-official business.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the penalty was mitigated due to her long service record and first offense, any further similar infractions will be dealt with more severely.
*   The decision underscores the importance of proper documentation (time cards, leave applications) and adherence to Civil Service Rules.
*   Reliance on verbal permission, without proper documentation, is insufficient to excuse absences.
*   The definition and consequences of Saturday duty and off-setting time are clarified in the context of Administrative Circular 2-99.
