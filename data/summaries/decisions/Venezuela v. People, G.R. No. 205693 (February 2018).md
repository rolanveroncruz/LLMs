**Case:** *Manuel M. Venezuela v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 205693, February 14, 2018. (826 Phil. 11)

**Holding:** Affirmed the Sandiganbayan's conviction of Manuel M. Venezuela for Malversation of Public Funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 10951. Penalty modified to reflect the amended law.

**Facts:**

*   Manuel M. Venezuela was the Municipal Mayor of Pozorrubio, Pangasinan (1986-June 30, 1998).
*   A COA audit (June 10, 1998) revealed a shortage of Php 2,872,808.00 in the joint accounts of Venezuela and then-Municipal Treasurer Pacita Costes. 17 cash advances by Venezuela were deemed illegal due to missing documentation.
*   Venezuela was neither bonded nor authorized to receive cash advances. Vouchers were improperly paid in cash despite exceeding Php 1,000.
*   COA issued demand letters. Venezuela acknowledged accountability for Php 943,200.00.
*   Information filed (March 20, 2000) charged Venezuela with malversation in violation of Article 217, RPC. Costes was implicated as a co-conspirator.
*   Venezuela surrendered and posted bail. Costes remained at large.
*   At trial, prosecution presented evidence of the shortage, illegal cash advances, and Venezuela's signature on disbursement vouchers. Defense claimed liquidation and presented receipts as proof.
*   Prosecution rebutted the receipts, showing they were issued to different payees, for different purposes, and during a time when Costes was no longer treasurer.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:**

*   Convicted Venezuela of malversation.
*   Prosecution proved all elements beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   Venezuela was a public officer, received public funds, and could not account for the shortage.
*   Defense of payment was unsubstantiated. Receipts discredited. Even if payment was proven, it isn't a defense for malversation.
*   Partial refund of Php 300,000.00 was considered a mitigating circumstance.
*   Sentenced to imprisonment, fine, and perpetual special disqualification.
*   Case against Costes was archived.

**Issue on Appeal:**

*   Whether the prosecution failed to establish Venezuela's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Court's Analysis/Reasoning:**

*   Upheld the Sandiganbayan's findings of fact.
*   Elements of malversation proven: (1) public officer, (2) custody/control of funds, (3) public funds, (4) misappropriation.
*   *Prima facie* evidence of malversation established by failure to account for funds upon demand, which the accused failed to overturn.
*   Payment/reimbursement is *not* a defense to malversation, although it can be a mitigating factor analogous to voluntary surrender. *Perez v. People, 568 Phil. 491 (2008)*
*   Receipts offered by Venezuela were successfully challenged, casting doubt on the defense of payment.
*   **Demand is not an element of malversation itself**, merely raises *prima facie* presumption of personal use. *Nizurtado v. Sandiganbayan, 309 Phil. 30 (1994)*. Timing of the demand letter immaterial.
*   Archiving the case against Costes did not absolve her. Criminal liability does not require all co-conspirators to be charged or convicted. *People v. Dumlao, 599 Phil. 565 (2009)*
*   Applied RA 10951 retroactively, as it was more favorable to the accused regarding the penalty. *RPC, Article 22*

**Holding and Disposition:**

*   Petition denied.
*   Sandiganbayan's decision affirmed with modification to the penalty to conform with RA 10951: indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*; fine of Php 2,572,808.00 with 6% legal interest from finality; perpetual special disqualification.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   Article 217 of the RPC (Malversation of Public Funds): Establishes the crime, elements, and penalties.
*   RA 10951: Amended Article 217, adjusting the amount thresholds and penalties.
*   Obligation of public officers to properly account for public funds.
*   Obligation of accountable officers to liquidate cash advances.
*   Requirement for proper documentation of cash disbursements.
*   Requirement for payment by check for amounts exceeding Php 1,000.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for malversation of public funds (imprisonment, fine, disqualification).
*   Civil liability for the amount malversed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to adequately document cash advances** leading to accusations of misappropriation.
*   **Reliance on potentially fraudulent documents** as proof of payment or liquidation.
*   **Lack of proper oversight** of municipal finances by relevant officials.
*   **Difficulty in proving a negative** (i.e., that funds *were* properly used).
*   *Prima facie* evidence and burden shift to accused once a shortage is established and demand is made, making a strong defense essential.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of what constitutes a "satisfactory explanation" for a shortage of public funds.  This is inherently fact-dependent and could be subject to interpretation.
*   While *demand* is not an element of malversation, the lack of demand could potentially impact the *prima facie* presumption of personal use. (Though the court clearly sides on that this has no effect, the argument could be tried.)

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 217 (Malversation) and Article 203 (Definition of Public Officer)
*   Republic Act No. 10951 (Amendment to RPC re: Penalties)
*   Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, Section 102
*   Local Government Code, Section 340

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Perez v. People, 568 Phil. 491 (2008)* (Payment/reimbursement is not a defense)
*   *Nizurtado v. Sandiganbayan, 309 Phil. 30 (1994)* (Demand is not an element of Malversation)
*   *People v. Dumlao, 599 Phil. 565 (2009)* (Liability can stand despite lack of conviction of co-conspirators)
*   *People v. Pantaleon, Jr., 600 Phil. 186 (2009)* (Municipal Mayor is accountable for public funds)
