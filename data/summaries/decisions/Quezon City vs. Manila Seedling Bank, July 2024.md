Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the consolidated cases, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Name:** *Quezon City Government vs. Manila Seedling Bank Foundation, Inc. (MSBF)* (G.R. No. 208788 & G.R. No. 228284), July 23, 2024

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari concerning zoning ordinances and property rights.

**Parties:**
*   *Petitioners:* Quezon City Government
*   *Respondent:* Manila Seedling Bank Foundation, Inc.

**Facts:**

*   In 1977, Proclamation No. 1670 granted MSBF usufructuary rights over a 7-hectare property (owned by NHA) in Quezon City.
*   In 2000 (amended in 2003), Quezon City enacted a Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance Nos. SP-918 and SP-1369) reclassifying the property as Metropolitan Commercial and Institutional Zone.
*   MSBF was initially granted Certificates of Non-Conformance, but renewal was denied in 2012 due to the zoning ordinance.
*   The Quezon City government foreclosed on the property for non-payment of realty taxes and took possession. MSBF disputes liability for these taxes.
*   SEC revoked MSBF's corporate registration in 2002, but the revocation was lifted in 2015.
*   MSBF filed two separate petitions with the RTC: one against the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance (G.R. No. 208788) and another against the Quezon City Government's possession and foreclosure of the property (G.R. No. 228284).

**Issues:**

1.  Propriety of direct appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) re: First Case.
2.  Whether MSBF had the legal capacity to sue despite the SEC's revocation of its registration.
3.  Whether MSBF may assail the validity of the Zoning Ordinance through a petition for prohibition.
4.  Whether Quezon City can assess realty taxes on NHA property and foreclose for non-payment, considering NHA's tax-exempt status.
5.  Whether the City can, in the guise of a Zoning Ordinance, reclassify or regulate the use of the subject property on which the Foundation exercises its usufructuary rights.

**Ruling:**

1.  **SC Jurisdiction:** The SC accepted jurisdiction due to genuine issues of constitutionality involved.
2.  **Legal Capacity:** Although MSBF lacked the legal capacity to sue *at the time of filing the petitions* due to its SEC revocation (operative between Feb 21, 2002 - Oct 14, 2015) , the Quezon City Government is **estopped** from raising this defense. *Rationale: The Quezon City Government consistently dealt with MSBF as a valid corporation, issuing permits and collecting fees. This recognition precludes the City from later challenging MSBF's corporate existence.*
3.  **Validity of the Remedy:** MSBF's petition assailing the ordinance is treated as a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The SC has power under expanded jurisdiction to undo acts with grave abuse of discretion.
4.  **Real Property Tax and Foreclosure:** The City cannot foreclose on the *NHA property* for MSBF's tax delinquency; NHA is tax-exempt. However, MSBF, as the *beneficial user*, is liable for real property taxes on the land, citing *BIR Revenue Regulation No. 9-93* and *Manila Seedling Bank Foundation, Inc. v. City Treasurer Victor B. Endriga, Quezon City, et al., docketed as G.R. No. 191335.* The SC cited *Light Rail Transit Authority v. Quezon City* reiterating that though the tax exemption does not extend to the beneficial user, the local government may not foreclose. But, granting the Foundation's petition for prohibition is not an appropriate remedy since it has become fait accompli.
5.  **Zoning Ordinance - Ultra Vires and Unconstitutional:** Portions of the Zoning Ordinance conflicting with MSBF's usufructuary rights under Proclamation No. 1670 are **ultra vires, and thus null and void**:
    *   The Court ruled that the Quezon City Zoning Ordinance contravened Proclamation No. 1670.
    *   It violates vested rights, citing *Buklod Nang Magbubukid sa Lupaing Ramos, Inc. v. E. M. Ramos and Sons, Inc.*
    *   Invalid exercise of police power as there's no imminent danger to public welfare, referring to *City of Batangas v. Philippine Shell Petroleum Corporation*
    *   The City cannot force compliance through threat of penalties.
    *   An ordinance is deemed ultra vires when it is contrary to the laws of the national government.

**Disposition:**

*   **G.R. No. 208788:** Petition DENIED. The Quezon City Government is estopped. Zoning Ordinance provisions infringing on MSBF's usufruct under Proclamation No. 1670 are declared NULL and VOID. However, the injunction for issuing permits is dissolved as moot.
*   **G.R. No. 228284:** Petition DISMISSED as moot because the Quezon City Government already seized possession of the subject property, citing Co, Sr. v. The Philippine Canine Club, Inc.. MSBF is *not precluded* from filing a separate action to nullify the foreclosure, recover possession, and/or seek damages.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Proclamation No. 1670:** Grants MSBF usufructuary rights.
*   **Quezon City Zoning Ordinance (SP-918 and SP-1369):** Reclassifies the property, requiring conformity.  The key contention revolves around whether this is a valid exercise of police power or an unlawful infringement on established property rights.
*   **Section 234(a) LGC:** NHA (the owner) remains tax-exempt, but MSBF (the beneficial user) is liable for real property taxes, but cannot be foreclosed.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The effect of the SEC revocation on MSBF's capacity to sue, *before* the revocation was lifted, is a major point of contention.  The SC resolves this through estoppel and deems null and void the Zoning Ordinance in question.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Buklod Nang Magbubukid sa Lupaing Ramos, Inc. v. E. M. Ramos and Sons, Inc.* – Vested rights.
*   *Light Rail Transit Authority v. Quezon City* – The local government may satisfy its tax claim by assessing the taxable beneficial user but may not foreclose.
*   *Social Justice Society v. Atienza, Jr.* - Exercise of police power should have a reasonable relation to the end in view.
*   *Co, Sr. v. The Philippine Canine Club, Inc.*: Injunction cannot be issued where the act sought to be enjoined has already become fait accompli.
*    *Magna Ready Mix Concrete Corp. v. Andersen Bjornstad Kane Jacobs, Inc.* To put it in another way, a party is estopped to challenge the personality of a corporation after having acknowledged the same by entering into a contract with it.
* *The Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Fatima v. Alzona*. The doctrine of corporation by estoppel is founded on principles of equity and is designed to prevent injustice and unfairness.
* *Estate of Yujuico v. Republic*:Estoppels against the public are little favored. They should not be invoked except in rare and unusual circumstances, and may not be invoked where they would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy adopted to protect the public. They must be applied with circumspection and should be applied only in those special cases where the interests of justice clearly require it.
* *City of Batangas v. Philippine Shell Petroleum Corporation*: Police power is the power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order, safety, and general welfare of the people.
