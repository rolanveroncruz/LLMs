## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Delociembre y Andales and Adam y Danga*, G.R. No. 226485

**Type of Document:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration reversing prior conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the motion for reconsideration, REVERSING the CA decision and ACQUITTING the accused-appellants due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs and its failure to offer justifiable grounds for deviation from the mandatory procedures outlined in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. The prosecution must prove (a) the identity of the buyer and seller, object, and consideration, and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165:** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs, including immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official. This is to maintain the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the crime, including the identity of the drugs and the unbroken chain of custody.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Previous Conviction:** Accused-appellants were previously convicted by the RTC and CA but were acquitted on appeal to the Supreme Court.
*   **Risk of Reversal:** The initial conviction highlights the risk of erroneous convictions in drug cases if mandatory procedures are not strictly followed.
*   **Liability for Law Enforcement:** The resolution implicitly criticizes the police officers' failure to comply with statutory procedure and to provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance.
*   **Potential for Civil Action:** Though not directly addressed, the unlawful arrest and prosecution could potentially give rise to civil actions against the apprehending officers or the State.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The foundational statute for the crime charged and the procedural requirements for handling evidence.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):** This amendment relaxes the strict requirements of Section 21 under justifiable circumstances. The Court notes that it clarifies and ratifies the interpretations previously present in IRR of RA 9165.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of media and DOJ representatives during seizure and marking.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** Requires the prosecution to explain reasons behind procedural lapses to invoke the saving clause.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** States that justifiable grounds for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, not presumed.
*   **People v. Dahil, 150 Phil. 212, 225 (2015):** States that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception:** The exception to strict compliance with Section 21 based on "justifiable grounds" is inherently ambiguous and subject to interpretation. The Court emphasized that the *prosecution* bears the burden of *proving* such justifiable grounds. This highlights the need for clear, documented explanations for any deviations from the procedure.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The specific details of the chain of custody are not explicitly detailed in the summary but are crucial to the outcome of the case. The resolution implies that these details were lacking or questionable, necessitating a closer examination of the original trial records.

**Overall Assessment:**

The document is a resolution highlighting the strict requirements for drug cases, particularly those mandated by Section 21 of RA 9165. The acquittal underscores the importance of adherence to procedural rules and the need for law enforcement to provide clear and convincing explanations for any deviations. The decision serves as a warning against procedural shortcuts and emphasizes the protection afforded by the Bill of Rights, even to those accused of serious crimes. The Court effectively shifted the burden to the prosecution to justify deviations from established procedures, rather than requiring the defense to prove prejudice.
