**Legal Document Summary: *Keld Stemmerik v. Atty. Leonuel N. Mas, A.C. No. 8010, June 16, 2009***

**Nature:** Disbarment proceeding against Atty. Leonuel N. Mas.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Complainant, a Danish citizen, sought Atty. Mas's legal advice on purchasing land in the Philippines.
*   Atty. Mas falsely advised complainant that he could legally acquire land, specifically a property in Zambales.  He received a P400,000 legal fee.
*   Atty. Mas prepared a contract to sell between the complainant (represented by Atty. Mas) and the purported owner, Bonifacio de Mesa. He also drafted and notarized a deed of sale from de Mesa to Ailyn Gonzales and a separate agreement between complainant and Gonzales stating that it was complainant who provided the funds for the purchase of the property.
*   Complainant paid Atty. Mas P3.8 million for the purchase.  Atty. Mas issued an acknowledgment receipt.
*   The land turned out to be inalienable, situated within a former US Military Reservation, according to the CENRO of the DENR. Furthermore, foreigners are constitutionally prohibited from owning land in the Philippines (Art. XII, Sec. 7 of the Constitution, *Krivenko v. Register of Deeds*, 79 Phil. 461 (1947)).
*   Atty. Mas became unreachable and absconded with the P3.8 million.
*   Atty. Mas abandoned his law practice.
*   IBP Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) recommended disbarment, finding Atty. Mas misrepresented the law, prepared falsified documents, and embezzled funds.
*   IBP Board of Governors adopted the recommendation, adding a requirement to return P4.2 million.
*   The Supreme Court agreed with the IBP.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Mas (Respondent):**
    *   **Disbarment:** Permanent removal from the Roll of Attorneys.
    *   **Financial Liability:** Ordered to return P4.2 million to Complainant Keld Stemmerik with 12% interest per annum from the date of the resolution until full payment.
    *   Potential Criminal Liability: The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is ordered to locate Atty. Mas and file appropriate criminal charges.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Notice:**  A key procedural issue was whether Atty. Mas received proper notice of the disbarment proceedings.  The Court held that service at his last known address was sufficient, even though he had abandoned his practice.  This is justified based on the principle of *Nemo tenetur ad impossibile* and the lawyer's obligation to keep contact information updated with the IBP.
*   **Circumvention of Anti-Dummy Law (Commonwealth Act No. 108):**  The arrangement involving de Mesa and Gonzales appears to be a scheme to circumvent the constitutional prohibition on foreign land ownership, potentially violating the Anti-Dummy Law, especially given Atty. Mas prepared documents that implied an ultimate transfer of beneficial ownership to Complainant Stemmerik. This implicates Rule 1.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Breach of Lawyer's Oath and Code of Professional Responsibility:** Atty. Mas violated his oath and several Canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility, including:
    *   Canon 1 (Upholding the Constitution and laws).
    *   Rule 1.01 (Unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct).
    *   Canon 7 (Integrity and dignity of the profession).
    *   Canon 15 (Candor, fairness, and loyalty to clients).
    *   Canon 16 (Holding client's money in trust).
    *   Canon 17 (Fidelity to the client).

**Statutory References:**

*   Constitution, Art. XII, Sec. 7 (Prohibition on alien land ownership)
*   Commonwealth Act No. 108 (Anti-Dummy Law)
*   Republic Act No. 141 (Public Land Act)
*   Code of Professional Responsibility

**Case Law:**

*   *Krivenko v. Register of Deeds*, 79 Phil. 461 (1947) (Aliens cannot acquire private or agricultural lands).
*   *Santos, Jr. v. PNOC Exploration Corporation*, G.R. No. 170943, 23 September 2008 (*Nemo tenetur ad impossibile*).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The circumstance of the fictitious sale to Gonzales was never adequately discussed by the complainant.
*   The precise mechanism of how this sale violated the Anti-Dummy Law, while clear in intent, requires further investigation into who ultimately benefitted financially from Gonzales.
* There were no objections from the respondent to the information provided by the complainant because the respondent abandoned the proceedings and the information was found to be accurate by the investigating commissioner.
