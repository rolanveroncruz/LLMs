## Legal Document Summary: NGO SIN SING vs. LI SENG GIAP & SONS, INC.

**Case:** NGO SIN SING AND TICIA DY NGO vs. LI SENG GIAP & SONS, INC., AND CONTECH CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, G.R. No. 170596, November 28, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Court of Appeals Decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** Owners (Ngo) contracted Contech to build a 5-story building adjacent to Li Seng Giap's (LSG) building. Excavation caused damage to the LSG building.
*   **Issue:** Liability for damages to LSG Building due to excavation during the construction of adjacent NSS Building.
*   **Holding:** Contech, the contractor, solely liable for the damages, due to negligence in providing sufficient lateral support during excavation.
*   **Civil Code Art. 684:** Excavations should not deprive adjacent land of sufficient lateral or subjacent support.
*   **Civil Code Art. 2176:** Quasi-delict; fault or negligence causing damage, is the base of the claim.
*   **Civil Code Art. 2194:** Solidary liability of two or more persons for quasi-delict.

**Obligations:**

*   **Contech:** To pay Li Seng Giap & Sons, Inc., the sum of P4,010,843.50 due to damages caused by negligent excavation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Contech:** Liable for damages to LSG building because the proximate cause of the damages was the negligent excavation, as the building was affected by the excavations done near the property.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Third Party Claims:** Despite a contractual clause seemingly shifting liability to Contech, the owners (Ngo) were initially held jointly and severally liable, highlighting the risk owners face in construction projects.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The potential for solidary liability under Art. 2194 means each party could be held liable for the entire amount of damages, creating a significant financial risk.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 684, New Civil Code:** Defines duty of lateral and subjacent support.
*   **Art. 2176, New Civil Code:** Establishes the basis for quasi-delict.
*   **Art. 2194, New Civil Code:** Defines solidary liability in quasi-delicts.
*   **Worcester v. Ocampo:** Established the solidary liability of joint tortfeasors.
*   **Lafarge Cement Philippines, Inc. v. Continental Cement Corporation:** Reinforced the solidary nature of obligations arising from tort.
*   **Citytrust Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Discussed determination of rights of co-defendants.
*   **Valenzuela v. Court of Appeals:** Define Contributory Negligence.
*   **Chan, Jr. v. Iglesia ni Cristo, Inc.:** Quoted the requisites of quasi-delict.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original contract clause seemingly absolving the owners (Ngo) from liability for third-party claims was not fully upheld, leading to initial solidary liability. The reliance of the owners on their construction contact would be scrutinized by the court.

**Summary of Findings and conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners (Ngo), finding that the contractor (Contech) was solely liable for damages due to negligence. The Supreme Court emphasized that there was contributory negligence on the part of the owners of Li Seng Giap Building for adding floors to a foundation without reinforcing it to accomodate the additional floors.
