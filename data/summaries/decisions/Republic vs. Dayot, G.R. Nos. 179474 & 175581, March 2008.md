Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided decision in *Republic of the Philippines vs. Dayot* and *Tecson-Dayot vs. Dayot*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Dayot; Tecson-Dayot vs. Dayot* (G.R. Nos. 175581 & 179474)**

**Core Issue:** Validity of a marriage celebrated without a marriage license based on a false affidavit claiming 5 years of cohabitation, pursuant to Article 76 of the Civil Code.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' Amended Decision, declaring the marriage between Jose Dayot and Felisa Tecson-Dayot void *ab initio* due to the absence of a valid marriage license and failure to meet the requirements for an exception under Article 76 of the Civil Code.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Civil Code Applicability:** The marriage occurred in 1986, prior to the Family Code, thus governed by the Civil Code.
*   **Marriage License Requirement:** Article 53 of the Civil Code requires a marriage license as an essential requisite, except in marriages of exceptional character (Art. 58, 80(3)).
*   **Article 76 Exception (Cohabitation):** Article 76 provides an exception for couples who have "lived together as husband and wife for at least five years" and execute an affidavit to that effect.
*   **Strict Interpretation of Exception:** The Court adopted a strict but reasonable construction of Article 76, emphasizing the mandatory nature of the five-year cohabitation requirement. Reference is made to Niñal v. Bayadog (384 Phil. 661 (2000)).
*   **Falsity of Affidavit:** The Court found as fact that Jose and Felisa had not cohabited for five years prior to their marriage, rendering their affidavit false.  The Republic admitted they only started living together approximately five months before the wedding. The Court held that it is a question of fact and is subject to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Effect of False Affidavit:** The false affidavit did not meet the requirements under Art. 76 of the Civil Code, is as if no affidavit was made. The affidavit cannot substitute a marriage license in this case.
*   **No Presumption of Marriage:** The presumption of marriage does not apply because a marriage contract had been produced as evidence.
*   **Estoppel & Equity Inapplicable:** The Court rejected the Republic's arguments based on estoppel and equity, noting that these principles do not override statutory law. An action for nullity of marriage is imprescriptible.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code (Specifically Articles 53, 58, 76, 80(3))**
*   **Family Code (for comparative purposes, Article 7)**
*   **Niñal v. Bayadog, 384 Phil. 661 (2000):**  Emphasized the need for strict compliance with the cohabitation requirement, interpreting it as a "legal union" had it not been for the absence of marriage. The 5 years immediately before the day of the wedding and that it should be a period of exclusivity and continuity.
*   **Hernandez v. Court of Appeals, 377 Phil. 919 (1999)** Citing the general proposition that any doubt should be resolved in favor of the validity of marriage.
*   **Act No. 3613** The Marriage Law.
*   **Vda. de Jacob v. Court of Appeals, 371 Phil. 693, 708 (1999)**.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court**

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The Court explicitly stated that the declaration of nullity is without prejudice to any potential criminal liability for falsification or other related offenses.
*   **Bigamy Charges:** Although not directly addressed in the *ponencia*, the underlying factual context involves Felisa filing bigamy charges against Jose. The nullity of the first marriage potentially impacts these charges.
*   **Property Disputes:** The decision has implications for the parties' property relations, as a void marriage does not create conjugal property rights.  Liquidation of any jointly acquired assets will likely be governed by principles of co-ownership.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court's strict interpretation of "lived together as husband and wife" in Article 76 may create uncertainty in future cases regarding the nature of the cohabitation required (e.g., whether occasional separations negate the "continuous" requirement).
*   This decision does not elaborate the meaning behind the declaration of the Civil Code that every intendment of law or fact leans towards the validity of marriage.
