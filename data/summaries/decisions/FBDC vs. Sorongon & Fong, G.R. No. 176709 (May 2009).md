## Legal Document Summary: *Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation vs. Hon. Edwin D. Sorongon and Valentin Fong* (G.R. No. 176709, May 08, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's jurisdiction over a claim for sum of money.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation (FBDC) - Real estate developer.
*   **Respondent:** Valentin Fong - Assignee of Maxco's (L & M Maxco Specialist Construction) retention money.
*   **Third Party:** L & M Maxco Specialist Construction (Maxco) - Contractor of FBDC.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Trade Contract:** FBDC and Maxco entered into a trade contract for construction work (structural and partial architectural package) on the Bonifacio Ridge Condominium Phase 1 (BRCP 1).
*   **Termination & Retention Money:** FBDC terminated the contract with Maxco, citing delays. Maxco was entitled to retention money.
*   **Assignment:** Maxco, facing creditor lawsuits (including respondent Fong), assigned its receivables (retention money) from FBDC to Fong to settle debts.
*   **Notice & Refusal:** Fong notified FBDC of the assignment, seeking confirmation and payment. FBDC initially acknowledged the receivables but stated they were not yet due. Later, FBDC denied any further amounts were due to Maxco due to rectification costs and garnishments.
*   **RTC Complaint:** Fong filed a complaint for sum of money against FBDC and Maxco in RTC Mandaluyong, claiming FBDC wrongfully paid other creditors despite notice of the assignment.
*   **Motion to Dismiss:** FBDC filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing lack of jurisdiction, claiming CIAC had exclusive jurisdiction based on the arbitration clause in the trade contract with Maxco.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC denied the Motion to Dismiss. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision, holding that the case involves the enforcement of the deed of assignment and not a construction dispute falling under CIAC jurisdiction.

**Holding and Reasoning:**

*   The Supreme Court denied FBDC's petition, affirming the CA decision.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court held that the Regional Trial Court (RTC) has jurisdiction, not the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC). The Court reasoned that Fong's claim arises from the *assignment* of Maxco's retention money, not from the Trade Contract itself. While Fong "stepped into the shoes" of Maxco, the validity of the contract itself isn't in dispute. The central issue is FBDC's alleged wrongful preference of other creditors after notice of the assignment to Fong. (EO 1008 Sec. 4). Relevant Case Law: Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Domingo, G.R. No. 180765, 27 February 2009
*   **Cause of Action:** The Court found that Fong's complaint states a cause of action, specifically alleging undue preference given to other creditors of Maxco over the retention money.
*   **Extinguishment of Claim:** The Court stated the resolution on extinguishment of claim needed a full blown trial as well as addressing the issue of why the payments to the other garnishing creditors were preffered over the payments to the respondent, FONG
*   **Indispensable Parties:** The Court rejected FBDC's argument that the other judgment creditors and the CIAC should have been impleaded as indispensable parties. The other creditors' rights are distinct and unaffected by the outcome.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Assignment:** While the SC stated that the validity of the trade contract was not in question, the validity and enforceability of the Deed of Assignment itself is crucial.  Any challenges to the assignment (e.g., lack of consideration, fraud) would impact Fong's claim.
*   **Priority of Claims/Garnishment:** The main contention centers around the priority of claims to the retention money.  The SC referenced that this would need to be resolved through trial and application of statues. The garnishment notices pre-dated the assignment notice, which will give FBDC a stronger position.
*   **Interpretation of "Construction Dispute":** FBDC unsuccessfully argued the CIAC's exclusive jurisdiction. The case highlights the fine line between a claim directly arising from a construction contract and one related to it through assignment. This interpretation could be challenged if new facts arise demonstrating a connection to the original agreement.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Executive Order No. 1008 (E.O. No. 1008):** Section 4 defines the jurisdiction of the CIAC.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 3, Section 7:** Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties.

**Recommendations:**

*   Analyze the validity and enforceability of the Deed of Assignment, and the timing of the assignment relative to the contract termination.
*   Thoroughly investigate the garnishment notices to determine their validity and priority.
*   Prepare evidence to support the claim that FBDC had sufficient notice of the assignment before paying other creditors.
*   Research relevant jurisprudence regarding priority of claims in the context of assigned receivables and garnishments.
