**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 12535-Ret**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution regarding the application for retirement/gratuity benefits of the late Judge Jimmy R. Butacan under R.A. No. 910 as amended, filed by his surviving spouse, Cecilia Butacan.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Grant of Gratuity Benefits:** The Court grants gratuity benefits to the heirs of Judge Butacan under R.A. No. 910, as amended.
*   **Period of Coverage:** Benefits are calculated based on service from June 19, 1995 (date of appointment as MTCC Judge) until September 11, 2004 (date the CA decision affirming his dismissal by the CSC became final and executory).
*   **Deduction:** A deduction of P10,000.00 is to be made from the gratuity benefits, representing an unpaid fine from A.M. No. MTJ-00-1320 (Gross Misconduct and Grave Abuse of Discretion case).
*   **Dismissal of Administrative Case (A.M. No. MTJ-96-1101):** The administrative case against Judge Butacan before the Court, based on the CSC dismissal, was considered closed and terminated due to his death, following the principle in *Bote v. Judge Eduardo*.
*   **Conditional Appointment:** The Court characterizes Judge Butacan's appointment as conditional, pending the resolution of the CSC administrative case. This is based on the ruling in *Heck v. Santos* which states that the Court may discipline a judge even for infractions prior to their appointment to the bench.

**Obligations:**

*   The Court's obligation is to compute and release gratuity benefits in accordance with R.A. 910 as amended, considering the specified period of service and the deduction.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability regarding the unpaid fine (P10,000.00) from A.M. No. MTJ-00-1320, which is to be deducted from the gratuity benefits.
*   The document addresses the issue of forfeiture of benefits in the CSC case. The forfeiture of benefits refers only to those earned while with the CSC, and not those earned while in the judiciary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Benefits:** Precise calculation of the gratuity benefits under R.A. 910, as amended, requires further computation based on Judge Butacan's salary and service record.
*   **CSC Forfeiture vs. Judicial Benefits:** The scope and impact of the CSC's forfeiture of benefits clause should be carefully analyzed to ensure it does not inappropriately encroach on the benefits accruing from his judicial service.
*   **Conditional Nature of Appointment:** The assertion of conditional appointment introduces a potential challenge in future scenarios.
*   **Retroactivity:** Though it addresses the retroactivity, there could be questions to determine if there will be any benefits being granted under the CSC.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 910 (as amended by R.A. No. 5095 and P.D. No. 1438):** Law governing retirement benefits for judges.

**Case Law:**

*   **Bote v. Judge Eduardo:** Cited as precedent for dismissing the administrative case due to the judge's death, for humanitarian reasons.
*   **Heck v. Santos:** Cited to support the Court's authority to discipline a judge for misconduct committed prior to their judicial appointment.

**Next Steps:**

*   Calculate the precise amount of gratuity benefits payable under R.A. 910, considering the defined period of service.
*   Ensure proper documentation and clearance regarding the P10,000.00 fine deduction.
*   Distribute the net gratuity benefits to the rightful heirs of Judge Butacan.
