## Summary of A.M. No. 07-10-254-MeTC (Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Merlie N. Yuson)

This resolution concerns the administrative matter of Merlie N. Yuson, a court stenographer, who went AWOL from her position in the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 1, Manila, starting April 2007.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **AWOL Defined:** Yuson failed to submit bundy cards, report to work, or file leave applications since April 2007, constituting Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL).
*   **Reporting Requirement:** Court employees are obligated to report for work and properly file leave applications for absences.
*   **Notification:**  The Employees Leave Division (ELD-OAS) sent a telegram requesting her bundy cards.
*   **Separation from Service:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended and the Supreme Court approved dropping Yuson from the rolls, declaring her position vacant, effective April 1, 2007.
*   **Notification Obligation:** Rule XVI, Section 63 of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, as amended by Circular No. 14, s. 1999, dictates that Yuson should be informed of her separation at her last known address within 5 days of effectivity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Yuson is liable for violating Civil Service Rules and Regulations regarding attendance and leave.
*   Her actions prejudiced the public interest by disrupting court operations and delaying the administration of justice.
*   She is deemed to have failed to adhere to the high standards of public accountability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Future employment prospects within the government sector may be negatively impacted by this AWOL record.
*   Potential for legal challenges if the procedural requirements of notification (Rule XVI, Section 63) were not strictly followed, although unlikely to reverse the decision given the prolonged absence.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule XVI, Section 63 of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, as amended by Circular No. 14, s. 1999:** This rule is the central basis for the decision, defining AWOL and its consequences (separation from service).
*   **Cited Cases:** *Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Ms. Fernandita B. Borja* (A.M. No. 06-1-10-MCTC, 13 April 2007); *Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Mr. Robert L. Borcillo* (A.M. No. 07-7-343-RTC, 05 September 2007); and *Re: Absence Without Official Leave of Mr. Basri A. Abbas* (A.M. No. 06-2-96-RTC, 31 March 2006, 486 SCRA 32). These cases establish precedent for dismissing employees for prolonged AWOL, emphasizing disruption of court functions and prejudice to public service.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious point (if any) would revolve around whether Yuson received proper notification as required by Rule XVI, Section 63.  If notification was not properly attempted at her address on file, there could be a procedural challenge, although the long period of absence would likely negate any successful challenge. The burden would be on Yuson to prove lack of notification.

**Overall:** The ruling is straightforward and follows established jurisprudence regarding AWOL in government service. The Court found no basis to excuse Yuson's prolonged and unexplained absence and acted appropriately in terminating her employment. The only potential vulnerability lies in strict compliance with the notification requirement.
