**Case Summary: *Mayon Estate Corporation and Earthland Developers Corporation vs. Lualhati Beltran***

**Citation:** 623 Phil. 369 (G.R. No. 165387, December 18, 2009)

**Core Issue:** Finality and executory nature of HLURB Arbiter decisions (dated January 25, 2002, and February 21, 2002) in two consolidated HLURB cases concerning the completion of development and ownership rights within Peñafrancia Hills Subdivision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 (25 January 2002 Decision):** Orders Mayon and Earthland to:
    *   Complete development of Peñafrancia Hills per approved plan (PD 957 compliance).
    *   Surrender possession of specific lots (Lot 1, Block 43 and Lot 27, Block 49 Annex II) to Beltran.
    *   Cease harassment of Beltran.
    *   Upon Beltran's payment of amounts due, execute Deeds of Sale and deliver titles free from liens.
    *   Pay Beltran damages: Actual (P200k + legal interest), moral (P100k), exemplary (P100k), and attorney's fees (P100k).
    *   Pay HLURB an administrative fine for violations under PD 957.
*   **HLURB Case No. REM-051702-11905 (21 February 2002 Decision):**
    *   Declares sale of Lot 1, Block 43, Annex II to Carmelita Cruz null and void.
    *   Orders Register of Deeds to cancel Cruz's TCT and reinstate previous TCT, annotating Beltran's rights.
    *   Orders Cruz, Roxas, NBC-Agro, and Earthland to restore Beltran's possession.
    *   Orders Cruz, Roxas, and NBC-Agro to pay Beltran damages: Moral (P100k), exemplary (P100k), and attorney's fees (P50k).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Mayon and Earthland:** Primarily liable in HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 for development completion, property surrender, and damages related to harassment and unlawful structure construction.
*   **Cruz, Roxas, and NBC-Agro:** Jointly and severally liable in HLURB Case No. REM-051702-11905 for damages resulting from the unlawful sale of the property.
*   **Earthland Developers Corporation:** Liable in HLURB Case No. REM-051702-11905 for restoring Beltran to the subject lot, and in HLURB Case No. REM-071597-9831 for the amount of the damages due to the demolition of the houses.

**Key Legal Arguments & Rulings:**

*   **Failure to Perfect Appeal:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed that Mayon and Earthland failed to perfect their appeal of the January 25, 2002 Decision due to non-compliance with Section 3(b), Rule XII of the HLURB Rules (specifically, the absence of a joint verified certification against forum shopping).
*   **Finality of Arbiter Decisions:**  Because the appeal was not properly perfected, the HLURB Arbiter's original decisions (January 25, 2002, and February 21, 2002) became final and executory.
*   **Res Judicata/Mootness:** The Supreme Court noted its prior denial of Cruz's petition (G.R. No. 177543), which challenged the same HLURB decisions, rendering the present petition moot. The ruling in G.R. No. 177543 affirmed the finality of the HLURB Arbiter's decisions.
*   **Office of the President:** Because the decision of the Arbiter became final, the Office of the President could not reverse those final orders, as the Office of the President has no authority to modify, annul, or set aside a final order.

**Statutory References:**

*   **PD 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree):** Section 20 and 38 relevant to violations leading to administrative fine. This law dictates the completion and development obligations of subdivision developers.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 (as amended):** Regarding certification against forum shopping.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement of Development Obligations:** The order to complete the development of Peñafrancia Hills could be subject to interpretation and potential disputes regarding the scope and specifics of the "approved subdivision plan."
*   **Damage Calculation:** There may be difficulty in the precise valuation of actual damages from demolition, leading to future disputes.
*   **Successors-in-Interest:** The decision impacts not just the named parties, but also potentially successors-in-interest or those acting on their behalf, potentially leading to future litigation.
*   **Third-Party Claims:** The rights of Carmelita Cruz were determined void.
*   **Lack of Proper Verification:** The issue regarding the lack of verification of the appealed documents is a continuing risk for the client if they are not properly following and complying with the applicable rules of court, as well as regulations set in place by HLURB.
