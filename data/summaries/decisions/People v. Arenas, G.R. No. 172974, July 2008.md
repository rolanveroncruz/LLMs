## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Arenas, G.R. No. 172974

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of the appellant, Cesar Arenas, for murder.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by Section 6 of Republic Act (RA) 7659.
*   **Accusation:** Arenas allegedly shot Noli Pe単afiel in the head on June 1, 1997, in Caloocan City, resulting in Pe単afiel's death. The information charged treachery and evident premeditation.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony identifying Arenas as the shooter. Defense presented denial and alibi (claiming he was in Dasmari単as, Cavite).
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** RTC found Arenas guilty beyond reasonable doubt, rejecting his denial and alibi based on positive identification by witnesses.  Sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered payment of civil indemnity (P50,000) and funeral expenses (P20,000).
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction but modified the judgment by adding moral damages (P50,000), exemplary damages (P25,000), and damages for loss of earning capacity (P1,943,868).
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals decision in toto, upholding the conviction and damage awards.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Cesar Arenas):** Obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*. Liable to pay the heirs of Noli Pe単afiel P50,000 civil indemnity, P50,000 moral damages, P25,000 exemplary damages, P20,000 reimbursement for funeral expenses, and P1,943,868 for loss of earning capacity.
*   **State:** Obligated to ensure Arenas serves his sentence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification Issue:** The primary issue revolves around the reliability of the eyewitness identification. Any discrepancies in the eyewitness accounts, or challenges to their credibility, could be a point of contention, although the lower courts found the testimony credible.
*   **Alibi:** The alibi defense was deemed weak and insufficient to overcome positive identification. Successfully challenging the positive identification could potentially revive concerns about the alibi, but given the consistent rulings against its credibility, such a scenario appears unlikely.
*   **Damage Calculations:** The calculation of damages, particularly the loss of earning capacity, could be subject to scrutiny regarding the evidentiary basis used to determine the victim's potential income. However, the Supreme Court found sufficient evidence to support the award.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes the crime of murder.
*   **Section 6, Republic Act (RA) 7659:** Amended Article 248 of the RPC regarding the penalty for murder.
*   **RA 9346, Section 3:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty and clarifies that individuals sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* are not eligible for parole.

**Case Law References:**

*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 04 July 2004, 433 SCRA 658:** Outlines the procedure for appeals from Regional Trial Courts in criminal cases, leading to the referral of this case to the Court of Appeals.

**Overall Assessment:**

The conviction appears solid, given the eyewitness identification and the weakness of the defense's alibi. The damage awards are also in line with established jurisprudence. The primary risk would be a successful challenge to the credibility of the eyewitnesses or a demonstration of a serious error in the calculation of damages for loss of earning capacity, but neither seems likely given the Supreme Court's affirmation of the lower court decisions. The appellant has exhausted his avenues of appeal.
