**Case Summary: *Gubaton v. Amador*, A.C. No. 8962, July 9, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative case for disbarment filed by Jildo Gubaton against Atty. Augustus Serafin D. Amador based on allegations of gross immoral conduct/immorality for having an illicit relationship with the complainant's wife.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Allegations:** Complainant alleged respondent, a former Assistant Prosecutor, engaged in an extramarital affair with his wife. Evidence presented included personal observations, affidavits from third parties, and love letters.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent denied the affair, claiming only acquaintance with the wife and innocent encounters.
*   **IBP Findings:** Initially, the IBP's Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) recommended dismissal for insufficient evidence, deeming much of the evidence hearsay. The IBP Board of Governors reversed this, suspending the respondent for two years.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's finding of administrative liability but modified the penalty. Respondent was found guilty of gross immorality and suspended from the practice of law for one year.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The Court emphasized the standard of substantial evidence in administrative cases. While some evidence was hearsay, the court applied the doctrine of independently relevant statements and considered the corroborated evidence (complainant's testimony, Navarez's affidavit, sister's statements) sufficient to prove the affair. The Court highlighted Navarez being a neutral witness.
*   **Respondent's Denial:** The Court deemed respondent's denial a weak defense, unsubstantiated by credible evidence.
*   **Violation of Code of Professional Responsibility:** The Court found that the respondent's conduct violated Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03, of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Obligations:**

*   Atty. Amador is obligated to adhere to the standards of moral character and integrity required of members of the bar, as outlined in the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   Atty. Amador is obligated to cease the practice of law for one year immediately upon receipt of the Decision.
*   Atty. Amador is obligated to file a Manifestation to the Court stating that his suspension has started, furnishing copies to all courts and quasi-judicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for gross immorality.
*   Suspension from the practice of law for one year.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Reliance on hearsay evidence, even when corroborated, presents a potential point of contention, though the Court addresses this with the independently relevant statement doctrine and corroboration. The strength of corroboration may be subject to interpretation.
*   **Interpretation of "Gross Immorality":** The definition and application of "gross immorality" can be subjective, relying heavily on the specific facts and circumstances presented in the case.
*   **Neutral Witness:** The Court considered Navarez a neutral witness which may subject to scrutiny due to his workplace and proximity to the subject of the case.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Rule 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03, which are the basis for the disciplinary action.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** Cited *Torres v. Dalangin, A.C. No. 10758, December 5, 2017* and *Advincula v. Macabata, 546 Phil 431, 445-446 (2007)* regarding the required quantum of evidence.
