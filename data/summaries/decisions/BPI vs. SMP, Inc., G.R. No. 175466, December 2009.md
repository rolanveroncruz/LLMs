## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. SMP, Inc. (G.R. No. 175466)

**Case:** Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), as successor-in-interest of Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC), vs. SMP, Inc.

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the RTC's finding of wrongful attachment, ruling that SMP, Inc. retained ownership of goods attached by FEBTC, not Clothespak.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied BPI's petition, affirming the CA decision. The SC held that the transaction between SMP and Clothespak was a **contract to sell**, not a contract of sale.  Therefore, ownership remained with SMP until the checks cleared.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Provisional Receipt:** Explicit reservation of ownership by SMP, stating "Materials belong to SMP Inc. until your checks clear."
*   **Contract to Sell:** Ownership retained by seller (SMP) until full payment (cleared checks), a positive suspensive condition.
*   **FOB (Free on Board) Clause:** The SC ruled that the F.O.B. clause regarding risk of loss during transit doesn't negate the existence of a valid Contract to Sell.

**Liabilities:**

*   **BPI (as successor of FEBTC):** Liable to SMP for actual damages of P2,963,041.53 due to wrongful attachment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Admissibility of Triplicate Copy:** BPI challenged the admissibility of the triplicate copy of the provisional receipt under the Best Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Sec. 3 of the Rules of Court).  The SC considered the triplicate copy as an original under Rule 130, Sec. 4(b) because it was executed simultaneously with the other copies.
*   **Interpretation of Provisional Receipt:** FEBTC argued the phrase regarding ownership retention was a fraudulent insertion.  The lower courts and SC found the receipt and testimony regarding it credible.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:**
    *   Art. 1478: Implied reservation of ownership by seller until full payment.
*   **Rules of Court:**
    *   Rule 130, Sec. 3: Best Evidence Rule.
    *   Rule 130, Sec. 4: Definition of "Original" document, including simultaneous copies.
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:**
    *   *Rivera v. del Rosario, 464 Phil. 783 (2004):* Distinction between a contract to sell and a contract of sale.
    *   *Spouses Dijamco v. Court of Appeals, 483 Phil. 203 (2004):* Clarifies the nature of the contract to sell.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case reaffirms the importance of clear contractual language regarding ownership retention. The *provisional receipt* was crucial in establishing SMP's intent to retain title until payment. The SC interpreted the facts and the receipt as evidence of a valid contract to sell. BPI's challenge to the admissibility of the receipt highlights the need to rigorously examine the authenticity and context of documentary evidence. Future actions should meticulously analyze the elements of the transaction, including the explicit language used and the intent of the parties, to determine whether a contract is a sale or a contract to sell. The key is to discern if the transfer of ownership is immediate upon delivery (sale) or contingent upon full payment (contract to sell).
