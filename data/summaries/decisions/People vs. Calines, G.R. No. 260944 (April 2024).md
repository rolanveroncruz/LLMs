**Case Summary: People v. Calines (G.R. No. 260944, April 3, 2024)**

This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of Fernan Calines for murder (of a minor, Sky Sabado) and attempted homicide (of Nida Sabado). The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Murder (Crim. Case No. 17-CR-11741):** Calines found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Killing was qualified by **treachery** due to the victim being a child of tender years (3 years old), thus defenseless. Abuse of superior strength was considered absorbed in treachery. Penalty: *Reclusion Perpetua*. Damages awarded to the heirs of Sky Sabado: PHP 75,000 Civil Indemnity, PHP 75,000 Moral Damages, PHP 75,000 Exemplary Damages, PHP 50,000 Temperate Damages, plus 6% legal interest p.a. from finality.
*   **Attempted Homicide (Crim. Case No. 16-CR-11674):** Calines found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempted homicide under Art. 6 and 249 of the RPC. The CA correctly downgraded the RTC's ruling of frustrated homicide based on failure of the prosecution to prove that Nida would have died from her wounds if not for medical intervention. No evidence presented to prove nature and extent of injury. Penalty: imprisonment for an indeterminate period of six months of *arresto mayor*, as minimum, to four years and two months of *prision correccional*, as maximum. Damages awarded to Nida Sabado: PHP 20,000 Civil Indemnity, PHP 20,000 Moral Damages, plus 6% legal interest p.a. from finality.
*   **Defense of Insanity (Art. 12, RPC):**  Rejected. Calines claimed insanity as an exempting circumstance. The Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings that the defense failed to prove that Calines was insane *at the time of the commission of the crimes*. The psychiatric evaluation report (by Dr. Gamueda) was deemed unreliable as it was based on examinations done *two years after* the incident and based largely on Calines's self-reporting. Calines's actions after the event (attempting to flee) indicated awareness of wrongdoing. Defense failed to satisfy the three-way test per *People v. Paña* (2020): (1) insanity must be present at the time of the commission of the crime; (2) insanity, which is the primary cause of the criminal act, must be medically proven; and (3) the effect of the insanity is the inability to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of the act.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The SC emphasized the RTC's superior position in assessing witness credibility (*Cahulogan v. People*, 2018). The prosecution's failure to present medical records or the attending physician's testimony on the extent of Nida's injuries led to the downgrade of the charge from frustrated to attempted homicide.
*   **Applicable Case Law:** *People v. Paña* (2020) - insanity defense; *People v. Pilen*, *People v. Pentecostes* - treachery in killing of minor; *Etino v. People* - doubt should be resolved in favor of the accused if character of wound is doubtful; *People v. Haloc* - surrounding circumstances that may show insanity; *People v. Jugueta* - Damages.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL):** Applied for attempted homicide but is inapplicable in the crime of Murder.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence for Sanity:** The court relies heavily on Calines's actions (fleeing) as evidence of sanity. This could be challenged by arguing alternative interpretations (e.g., fear, panic) consistent with mental instability, particularly in light of his past psychiatric history.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Dr. Gamueda's testimony regarding Calines's 2014 psychiatric diagnosis was based on hearsay, as she was not the diagnosing physician.
*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Intent to Kill":** While the use of a deadly weapon (alnos wood) is indicative, demonstrating the *specific intent* to kill Nida could be debated, particularly without detailed medical testimony on the potential lethality of the inflicted blows.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 6 (Attempted Felony), Art. 12 (Exempting Circumstances - Insanity), Art. 248 (Murder), Art. 249 (Homicide), Art. 51, Art. 63(2)
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL)

**Next Steps:**

*   A motion for reconsideration could be considered, but success is unlikely given the strength of the evidence and consistent findings of the lower courts.
*   A potential avenue for relief, albeit slim, might be appealing to executive clemency based on mitigating circumstances related to his mental health history, although this would require acknowledging guilt.
