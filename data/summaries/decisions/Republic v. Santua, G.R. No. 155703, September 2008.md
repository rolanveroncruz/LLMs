**Case Summary: Republic v. Santua, G.R. No. 155703, September 08, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) grant of a petition for judicial reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-22868.

**Key Issue:** Whether tax declarations, technical descriptions, and survey plans are sufficient bases for the reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title under Republic Act (RA) No. 26.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, holding that tax declarations, technical descriptions, and survey plans are *insufficient* bases for reconstitution under RA No. 26. The petition for reconstitution was denied.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **RA No. 26, Section 3:** Enumerates the documents that may serve as valid bases for reconstitution, prioritizing (a) owner's duplicate, (b) co-owner's/mortgagee's/lessee's duplicate, (c) certified copy from the Register of Deeds, (d) deed of transfer on file with description, (e) document on file with mortgage/lease, and (f) "any other document."
*   **Interpretation of "Any Other Document" (Section 3(f)):** Applying *ejusdem generis*, the Court ruled that "any other document" refers only to documents similar in nature to those listed in Section 3(a)-(e). The Court emphasizes that the documents in subsections a-e had been issued or are on file with the Register of Deeds, thus, have high credibility.
*   **Tax Declarations:** The Court relied on *Heirs of Eulalio Ragua v. Court of Appeals* and stated that a tax declaration is primarily for taxation purposes and prepared by the owner, rendering it unreliable for proving ownership or title. At most, the tax declaration can only be *prima facie* evidence of possession, and the question is not possession but reissuance. Reference to Section 202, Chapter II, Local Government Code, is implied.
*   **Survey Plans and Technical Descriptions:** The Court cited *Lee v. Republic* and held that these are merely additional documents required under Section 12 of RA No. 26 and Land Registration Commission Circular No. 35, not independent bases for reconstitution. The Supreme Court had declared reconstitution based on a survey plan and technical descriptions void for lack of factual support in this case. Cites *Rizal Cement Co., Inc. v. Villareal*, stating that a survey plan or technical description prepared at the instance of a party cannot be considered in their favor, as it would be considered self-serving.
*   **Reconstitution vs. Confirmation of Title:** The Court reiterated that reconstitution proceedings *do not* adjudicate ownership.  If reconstitution fails due to insufficient evidence, the petitioner can still pursue confirmation of title under the Land Registration Act. Reference to Section 15, RA No. 26, is implied.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner (Republic) has an obligation to ensure strict adherence to the requirements of RA No. 26 in reconstitution proceedings.
*   The Register of Deeds has an obligation to act only based on the documents as bases of reconstitution.

**Liabilities:**

*   Hasty and reckless grant of reconstitution petitions exposes the judiciary to criticism, and can cause prejudice to the public.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Fraudulent Claims:** Relaxed reconstitution standards can enable illegal acquisition of Torrens titles over land already covered by existing titles.
*   **Third-Party Rights:** Incorrectly re-issuing titles can infringe on the rights of legitimate landowners.
*   **Legal Challenges:** Improperly granted reconstitutions are vulnerable to legal challenges.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Heirs of Eulalio Ragua v. Court of Appeals, 381 Phil. 7 (2000)* - Regarding the unreliability of tax declarations.
*   *Lee v. Republic, 418 Phil. 793 (2001)* - Reconstitution based on survey plans and technical descriptions is void.
*   *Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. L-68303, January 15, 1988, 157 SCRA 62, 66* - Regarding the nature of reconstitution as a land registration proceeding.
*   *Rizal Cement Co., Inc. v. Villareal, No. L-30272, February 28, 1985, 135 SCRA 15, 23* - Regarding self-serving plans as invalid bases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "any other document" under Section 3(f) of RA No. 26 is often litigated, requiring a case-by-case analysis based on the specific documents presented.
*   Whether a document is "similar" to those in Section 3(a)-(e) can be subjective and open to differing judicial interpretations.
