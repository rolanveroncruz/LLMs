## Legal Document Summary: *Re: Judge Hector B. Barillo vs. Clerk of Court Carmel A. Cuizon and Sheriff Pershing T. Yared* (A.M. No. 05-12-372-MTCC)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative matter regarding grave abuse of authority charges against a Clerk of Court and Sheriff.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Judge Barillo filed a complaint against Clerk of Court Cuizon and Sheriff Yared for releasing a levied vehicle (Strada) without his knowledge or authority, after receiving payment from a third party (the judgment obligor).
*   **Procedural Irregularity:** Judge Barillo directed Yared to auction the Strada after a resolution became final. Yared did not conduct the auction. Instead, he accepted payment, with Cuizon's conformity, from a third party and released the vehicle, directly to the judgement obligor, Jose Calderon Jr.
*   **Respondents' Justification:** Yared and Cuizon claimed they acted to expedite settlement. Yared relied on Rule 39, Section 18 of the Rules of Court (payment prevents sale), arguing the auction became moot. Cuizon argued that payment by a third party is valid under Article 1238 of the Civil Code. The City Prosecutor initially saw no issues with their actions.
*   **OCA Report:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Yared liable for misconduct for defying a lawful court order, and Cuizon for unduly exercising a judicial function. The OCA stated that while the judgment obligor may pay to prevent sale, the property cannot be released without specific court authorization.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court found both Yared and Cuizon guilty of **simple misconduct**. While acknowledging the lack of malice or intent to gain, the Court held that Yared exceeded his authority under Canon IV, Sec. 6 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, and Cuizon usurped judicial authority by conforming to the vehicle's release. The Court further said that neither should have exercised discretion that solely belongs to a judge.
*   **Penalty:** Suspension without pay for one (1) month and one (1) day, with a stern warning.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff (Yared):** Obligated to follow court orders regarding execution and sale. Liable for releasing property without court authorization, even after judgment debt payment.
*   **Clerk of Court (Cuizon):** Obligated to perform administrative functions without usurping judicial authority. Liable for participating in the release of the property without court authorization.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The decision highlights the fine line between facilitating settlement and exceeding delegated authority. While Rule 39, Section 18 allows for preventing sale via payment, it doesn't automatically authorize release without court approval. This creates potential ambiguity for sheriffs in similar situations.
*   **Usurpation of Judicial Authority:** This is a critical point. The decision underscores that even well-intentioned actions can be deemed an encroachment on the judge's exclusive domain of judicial discretion, particularly regarding the release of levied assets.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 18, Rules of Court:**  Discussed regarding the effect of payment before execution sale. The Court made it clear that while the sale may be prevented, the sheriff must still obtain leave of court to release the levied property to the obligor.
*   **Article 1238, Civil Code:** Cited by Cuizon to justify payment by a third party, which the Court did not reject. However, that fact did not excuse the failure to obtain leave of court before releasing the vehicle.
*   **Canon IV, Sec. 6, Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Cited as violated by Yared.
*   **Solidbank Corporation v. Capoon, Jr. (A.M. No. P-98-1266):** Defines the role of Clerks of Court.
*   **Biag v. Gubatanga (A.M No. P-99-1341):** Cited by the OCA, describing the release of property without court authorization as usurpation of judicial authority.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** defines punishment for simple misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

This decision serves as a cautionary tale for court personnel regarding the strict boundaries of their authority and reinforces the exclusive nature of judicial discretion. It highlights the importance of adherence to court orders and procedures, even when attempting to expedite settlement and is a good reminder of the importance of adhering to procedure, even in what seems to be a good-faith attempt to comply with the law.
