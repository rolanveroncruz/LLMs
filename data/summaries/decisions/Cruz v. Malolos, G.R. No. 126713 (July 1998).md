## Legal Document Summary: *Cruz v. Court of Appeals, 354 Phil. 1036 (1998)*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision reversing the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Antipolo, Rizal, and CA Resolution denying reconsideration.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Delfin and Adoracion Cruz had children Thelma, Nerissa, Arnel, and Gerry. Upon Delfin's death, Adoracion and the children executed a Deed of Partial Partition (DPP) allocating shares of land in Taytay, Rizal.
*   The next day, they executed a Memorandum Agreement (MOA) stating their intention to share equally the proceeds from the sale of any lot from the DPP, regardless of individual ownership. The MOA was annotated on the land titles.
*   Nerissa Cruz Tamayo was issued titles based on the DPP, subject to the MOA annotation.
*   Spouses Eliseo and Virginia Malolos obtained a judgment against Nerissa and Nelson Tamayo and levied/executed on the lots registered in Nerissa's name.  The Malolos's purchased the properties at auction when Nerissa failed to redeem.
*   Adoracion, Thelma, Gerry, and Arnel Cruz (Petitioners) filed a complaint for partition against the Malolos spouses, claiming co-ownership based on the MOA.
*   RTC ruled for Petitioners, ordering partition. CA reversed, dismissing the complaint without prejudice to claims for proceeds from the auction sale against Nerissa Cruz Tamayo, finding the MOA did not supersede the DPP.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Deed of Partial Partition (DPP):**  The DPP conveyed individual ownership of specific lots to each heir, including Nerissa Cruz Tamayo.
*   **Memorandum Agreement (MOA):** The MOA contains clauses stating that the parties are co-owners *pro-indiviso* but also contains clauses indicating that the DPP remained in effect, and its parties would simply share in the proceeds of any sale of individually-owned property.
*   **Novation (Art. 1292, Civil Code):** The Court held that the MOA did *not* novate the DPP.  It stated the MOA did not expressly state intent to extinguish the previous obligation, nor was it entirely incompatible with it. The court held that sharing proceeds of sale is not incompatible with individual land ownership. *Fortune Motors (Phils.) Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 267 SCRA 653, 668*. This highlights the requirement for either express or complete incompatibility for implied novation.
*   **Co-ownership (Art. 484, Civil Code):**  The Court held that MOA did not create a co-ownership because the MOA stipulated that the registered owner can dispose of the land, an act which is inherently indicative of ownership and contradicts co-ownership.
*   **Estoppel by Deed:** Petitioners, in dealings related to other properties covered by the DPP, represented themselves as absolute owners. The court found the presentation of this information was relevant, and therefore there was an exception for the *res inter alios acta* rule because they were probative of the question of ownership. This inconsistent conduct bars them from now claiming co-ownership. *Roblett Industrial Construction Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 266 SCRA 71*.
*   **Res Judicata:** Petitioners argued a prior Quezon City RTC order confirmed their co-ownership. The Court rejected this, holding that the order was in a case for collection of sum of money, and any disquisition on co-ownership was only incidental to levying/executing on the properties. The court's decision in the present case held that res judicata could not apply because there was no identity between the causes of action. *Mangoma vs. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 21*.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Nerissa Cruz Tamayo has an obligation under the MOA to share proceeds from the sale of the covered lands with the petitioners, but is the sole owner.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Petitioners' potential claim for proceeds from the sale against Nerissa is preserved, but dependent on her ability to satisfy such a claim.
*   The Malolos spouses now hold title to the property without the need for partition.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code Articles 428, 484, 1292
*   Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 34
*   *Reyes vs. Court of Appeals, 264 SCRA 35, 43*
*   *Fortune Motors (Phils.) Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 267 SCRA 653, 668*
*   *Tanguilig vs. Court of Appeals, 266 SCRA 78, 83*
*   *Republic vs. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 712, 722*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The MOA's introductory statement declaring co-ownership *pro-indiviso* alongside provisions preserving individual title and granting the right to dispose is internally inconsistent, resulting in differing interpretations. The court resolved this ambiguity by focusing on the operative provisions confirming separate ownership.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that the MOA did not novate the DPP, nor did it create a co-ownership. The Court also applied the principle of estoppel to bar petitioners from claiming co-ownership. The case highlights the importance of clear and unambiguous language in contracts, and the principle that courts will interpret contracts based on their plain meaning and the parties' demonstrable intent.
