## Legal Document Summary: *Pascual v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 120575, December 16, 1998*

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision denying a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Core Issue:** Whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) had jurisdiction to award attorney's fees to Atty. Santos after the death of his client (Doña Adela) and whether the heirs of Doña Adela were deprived of due process. The Petitioner also questions the factual and legal basis for the award.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Award of Attorney's Fees:** The RTC awarded Atty. Santos 15% of the ¾ share of the estate of Doña Adela Soldevilla Pascual as attorney's fees.
*   **Writ of Execution:** The RTC ordered a writ of execution for P2,000,000.00 in favor of Atty. Santos, to be implemented against Doña Adela's share.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** A prior compromise agreement stipulated the distribution of the estate: ¾ to Doña Adela and ¼ to the other heirs of Don Andres.
*   **Payment of Docket Fees:** The court requires the payment of docket fees for the claim of attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   The estate of Doña Adela is liable for the attorney's fees owed to Atty. Santos.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Attorney's Fees:** The heirs of Doña Adela, represented by the petitioner, challenged the validity and amount of the attorney's fees award.
*   **Intervention by Other Heirs:** Other heirs of Doña Adela attempted to intervene, alleging a conspiracy involving the judge, petitioner, and Atty. Santos.

**Holding/Outcome:**

The Supreme Court denied the Petition and affirmed the CA's decision. The Court held that the RTC had jurisdiction to award attorney's fees, the heirs were not deprived of due process, and there were sufficient factual and legal bases for the award. The Court also denied the Omnibus Motion for Intervention as it was filed beyond the prescribed period and lacked merit.
