## Legal Document Summary: *Maersk-Filipinas Crewing, Inc. vs. Lumagas* (G.R. Nos. 256137 & 256154)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the NLRC decision granting Eugenio T. Lumagas (Seafarer) permanent and partial disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Work-Relatedness & Compensability:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the lower courts' finding that the seafarer's Deep Vein Thrombosis, Ischemic Heart Disease, and Protein-S Deficiency are work-related and compensable under the POEA-SEC (Sec. 32-A). The SC reiterated that compensability depends on the work connection, not pre-existing conditions aggravated by work (**Fil-Pride Shipping Company, Inc. v. Balasta** and others). They were not pre existing, or aggravated by his work.
*   **Pre-existing Condition:** The SC rejected the employer's argument that the seafarer concealed his Hepatitis B condition, referencing the Pre-Employment Medical Examination where he disclosed the illness, therefore, did not violate terms of POEA SEC (**More Maritime Agencies v. NLRC**).
*   **Disability Assessment:** The SC upheld the Grade 7 disability assessment (moderate or residual disorder) by the company-designated physician as final and controlling. The assessment was deemed final because it was the basis for the end of his treatment.
*   **Third Doctor Rule (Sec. 20(A)(3) POEA-SEC):** The SC emphasized the mandatory nature of the third doctor referral process in case of conflicting medical assessments. The seafarer's failure to comply by immediately filing his complaint after seeking a second opinion, without seeking a joint third doctor's opinion made company doctor final and binding on the seafarer, even against a contrary opinion (**Philippine Hammonia [v. Dumadag]**).
*   **Monetary Awards:** The SC affirmed the award of attorney's fees, citing the unjustified withholding of disability benefits by the employer, and the award of sickness allowance, finding the employer's proof of payment unpersuasive.

**Obligations:**

*   Maersk-Filipinas and A.P. Moller are obligated to pay Lumagas permanent and partial disability benefits of USD 20,900.00.
*   Maersk-Filipinas and A.P. Moller are obligated to pay attorney's fees.
*   Maersk-Filipinas and A.P. Moller are obligated to pay sickness allowance due

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to pay in accordance with the final and binding decision will result in standard enforcement remedies.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the SC's decision may lead to further legal action, including garnishment and attachment of assets.
*   **Future Claims:** While the assessment is final, new conditions directly attributable to employment could generate subsequent claims.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*The very wording of the company-designated physician's report demonstrates its final and definite character: "If patient is entitled to disability, his final disability grading is Grade 7 – moderate [or residual] disorder."[77] Notably, the same October 13, 2015 medical report marked the end of the company-designated physician's treatment of Lumagas* this phrase **"If patient is entitled to disability, his final disability grading is Grade 7 – moderate [or residual] disorder."** This is contingent and is not binding.

    *   Section 20(A)(3) - Dispute Resolution (Third Doctor Rule)
