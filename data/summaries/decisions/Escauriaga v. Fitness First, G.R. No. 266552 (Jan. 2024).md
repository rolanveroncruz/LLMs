**Case:** *Rico B. Escauriaga, et al. vs. Fitness First, Phil., Inc., and Liberty Cruz* (G.R. No. 266552, January 22, 2024)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that Petitioners, former freelance personal trainers, are regular employees of Fitness First. The Court held that the company exercised control over the petitioners, negating the status of independent contractors.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Petitioners are independent contractors or regular employees.
*   **Ruling:** Petitioners are regular employees of Fitness First.
*   **Four-Fold Test:** The Court applied the four-fold test and the economic dependence test.
    *   *Selection and Engagement:* While initially engaged as fitness consultants, the repeated fixed-term "independent contractor" agreements indicated an attempt to circumvent security of tenure. Cites *Dumpit-Murillo v. Court of Appeals*.
    *   *Payment of Wages:*  Though paid on a commission basis, the Labor Code recognizes commission as a form of wage.
    *   *Power to Dismiss:*  Fitness First retained the power to terminate based on lack of qualification, just cause, or failure to meet minimum performance standards as per contract terms.
    *   *Power to Control:* Fitness First exercised control, by requiring performance of services integral to its business, educational training, and imposition of minimum performance standards. Their actions did not allow them to work as they saw fit, as their actions were under the supervision of the corporation.
*   **Economic Dependence Test:** The extent of workers investment in equipment and facilities was not considered. But the integral part of the employer's business was considered. As well as the exclusivity clause.
*   **Freelance Personal Trainer Agreement:** Despite clauses suggesting independence, the agreement contained provisions granting Fitness First significant control (e.g., assignment to health clubs, adherence to rules, attendance at training sessions, minimum sales quotas, unilateral revisions to standards).
*   **Remedies:** Fitness First must reinstate Petitioners to their former positions, pay full backwages, overtime pay, 13th-month pay, and other benefits and privileges from the time of dismissal to reinstatement, plus attorney's fees (10%).
*   **Liberty Cruz's Liability:** Respondent Liberty Cruz, the Senior HR Manager, is *not* held solidarily liable because Petitioners failed to demonstrate malice or bad faith on her part.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Court acknowledges the NLRC was erroneously impleaded, and dismisses the issue.
*   **Immutability of Judgement:** A departure from the doctrine of immutability of judgement is warranted because the strict application would defeat the constitutional policy on the protection of labor.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 294 [279] (Security of Tenure), Definition of wage.
*   **1987 Constitution:** Article XIII, Section 3 (Labor rights and security of tenure).
*   **BIR Regulation No. 4-2014:** re: Guidelines and Policies for the Monitoring of Service Fees of Professionals.
*   **Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Failure to include the lower courts as petitioners or respondents.

**Case Law:**

*   **Sonza v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp.:** Respondents relied on this case to argue independent contractor status; the Supreme Court distinguished it.
*   **Dumpit-Murillo v. Court of Appeals:**  Fixed-term contracts used to circumvent security of tenure are invalid.
*   **Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Economic dependence test factors considered.
*   **Altres v. Empleo:** On signing the verification and certification against forum shopping.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Monetary Awards Calculation:** The specific calculation of backwages, overtime pay, and other benefits may be subject to dispute, especially in light of the commission-based payment system.
*   **Feasibility of Reinstatement:** The feasibility of reinstatement after a significant period may be contested by Fitness First based on operational changes or other valid grounds.
*   **Definition of Control:** The degree of control exercised by Fitness First was a key point of contention. The Court viewed several contractual and practical requirements as indicative of control, despite language seemingly granting independence. The extent to which similar clauses in other agreements might be interpreted as control remains a risk.
*   **Prescriptive Period:** The case also notes that the illegal dismissal claim was not prescribed. As the claim did not occur at engagement as freelance trainers, as claimed.
