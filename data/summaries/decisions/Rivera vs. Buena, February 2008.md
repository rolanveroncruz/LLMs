**Case Summary: Rivera v. Buena, A.M. No. P-07-2394 (Feb. 19, 2008)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a Clerk of Court, Danver A. Buena, for gross neglect of duty, inefficiency, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, stemming from the loss of a Formal Offer of Evidence in a criminal case.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Edgardo C. Rivera (Complainant) alleged that Buena (Respondent), as Branch Clerk of Court, failed to properly manage court records, resulting in the loss of the prosecution's formal offer of evidence.
*   **Procedural History:**  The prosecution rested its case in 2004. An ex parte motion for early resolution filed in 2005 was not acted upon. A 2006 Order incorrectly stated the prosecution hadn't offered evidence.  A subsequent order deemed the prosecution to have waived its right to offer evidence due to the missing document.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Buena claimed a voluminous workload (acting as officer-in-charge and legal researcher), blaming subordinates for the missing document and failure to properly notify the complainant of orders. He also claimed that he instructed several court personnel to locate the formal offer of evidence filed by the prosecution but despite diligent efforts, they failed to locate the same.
*   **OCA Findings:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Buena guilty of simple neglect of duty, noting his failure to monitor pending cases and properly supervise subordinates. The OCA relied on the fact that based on office records, specifically the transmittal of pleadings that the prosecution had filed, it appeared that complainant’s formal offer of evidence was received by the trial court on 26 April 2004.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the OCA's findings, holding Buena guilty of simple neglect of duty for the loss of the prosecution's formal offer of evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Clerk of Court's Duty:**  Clerks of Court have a duty to diligently maintain court records and supervise subordinates, per Rule 136, Sec. 7 of the Rules of Court and *Atty. Bandong v. Ching, 329 Phil. 714, 719 (1996)* (citing MANUAL FOR CLERK OF COURT).
*   **Liability for Neglect:** Failure to properly attend to duties due to carelessness or indifference constitutes simple neglect of duty, as defined in *Pascual v. Alvarez, A.M. No. P-04-1882, 30 September 2004, 439 SCRA 545, 552.*
*   **No Delegation of Responsibility:** A Clerk of Court cannot evade liability by blaming subordinates (*Solidbank Corp. v. Capoon, Jr., 351 Phil. 936, 942 (1998)*).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defenses Rejected:**  The Court rejected defenses of voluminous workload and delegation of responsibility.
*   **Lack of a Formal Offer:** The order dated 11 September 2006 states that the case was submitted for decision on August 17, 2004 without offer of evidence by the prosecution.
*   **Standard of Diligence:** The case highlights the high standard of diligence expected of court personnel and emphasizes their administrative liability for negligence.
*   **Simple Neglect Penalty:** The penalty for simple neglect of duty is suspension for one month and one day to six months for the first offense under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. Buena received a two-month suspension.
