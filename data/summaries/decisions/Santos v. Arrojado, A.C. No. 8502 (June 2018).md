**Summary of *Santos v. Arrojado*, A.C. No. 8502 (2018)**

**Issue:** Whether Article 1491(5) of the Civil Code, which prohibits lawyers from acquiring property involved in litigation they participated in, extends to their immediate family members.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant Santos filed a disbarment complaint against Atty. Arrojado, alleging violation of Article 1491 of the Civil Code.
*   Atty. Arrojado represented Lilia in an unlawful detainer case against Santos, which eventually reached the Supreme Court.
*   While the case was pending before the Supreme Court, Lilia sold one of the properties in *litis pendentia* to Atty. Arrojado's son, Julius. Atty. Arrojado witnessed the sale.
*   Santos claimed Atty. Arrojado committed malpractice by acquiring an interest in the litigated property through his son.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court dismissed the disbarment complaint, holding that Article 1491(5) does not extend to immediate family members of lawyers.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Article 1491(5) of the Civil Code:** This article prohibits justices, judges, prosecuting attorneys, clerks of court, and other officers and employees connected with the administration of justice, as well as lawyers, from acquiring property and rights in litigation in which they participated due to their profession. This is based on public policy to prevent abuse of fiduciary relationships and undue influence.
*   **Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius:** The Court applied this maxim, meaning the express mention of one thing excludes all others. Since Article 1491(5) specifically lists individuals prohibited from purchasing litigated property and does not mention relatives, the prohibition does not extend to relatives.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Conduit:** The Court emphasized the lack of evidence showing Julius acted as a conduit or nominee for Atty. Arrojado. The son was an adult, independent, and capable of acquiring property on his own.
*   **Fiduciary Relationship:** While a fiduciary relationship exists between a lawyer and client, the Court found insufficient proof that Atty. Arrojado used this relationship to influence the sale or benefit personally.

**Obligations:**

*   Lawyers must refrain from directly acquiring property involved in litigation they are handling as per Article 1491(5).

**Liabilities:**

*   Violation of Article 1491(5) may constitute unethical conduct and subject a lawyer to disciplinary action, including disbarment. However, this case clarifies that the prohibition does not extend to family members acting independently.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appearance of Impropriety:** Even though not explicitly prohibited, a lawyer's involvement in a transaction where a close family member acquires property related to the lawyer's legal work can raise ethical concerns and damage the lawyer's reputation.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While the Court required concrete evidence of acting as a conduit, the absence of clear evidence doesn't necessarily negate the risk. If there is significant indication or circumstantial evidence proving the lawyer benefitted from the transaction through the relative, the lawyer could face scrutiny.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** The Court does not dive into the argument of possible conflict of interest, it is important to remember that representing a client and potentially assisting a family member to acquire property belonging to the client is a serious case of conflict of interest, especially if it results in prejudice to the client.
