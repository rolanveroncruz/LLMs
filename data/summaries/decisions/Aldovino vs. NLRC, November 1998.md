## Legal Document Summary: *Aldovino v. NLRC, G.R. No. 121189*

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for certiorari regarding the NLRC's application of *res judicata* to the illegal dismissal claims of Gaudencio Aldovino and Anacleto Pimentel, former employees of Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Company of Manila, Inc. (AG&P). The employees argue their layoffs were illegal, while AG&P contends the issue was already resolved in a prior voluntary arbitration.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Presidential Directive No. 0191:** AG&P issued this directive outlining emergency measures, including a 40% temporary layoff due to severe financial losses. This is the basis for the company's actions.
*   **Voluntary Arbitration (Batino Decision):** A prior voluntary arbitration, initiated by the United Rank and File Association (URFA) union (to which Aldovino and Pimentel belonged), upheld AG&P's right to temporarily lay off employees due to substantiated financial losses. This is the central point of contention regarding *res judicata*.
*   **7 September 1991 Agreement:** An agreement between AG&P and its unions (including URFA) outlined financial assistance for laid-off employees. Aldovino and Pimentel received assistance.
*   **Petitioners' Claims:** Aldovino and Pimentel claim unfair labor practice, illegal layoff/dismissal, and non-payment of CBA benefits. They seek reinstatement and back wages.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **AG&P's Obligation (Prior to NLRC Decision):**  The Labor Arbiter initially ordered AG&P to reinstate Aldovino and Pimentel and pay back wages, finding the extended layoff akin to illegal dismissal.
*   **Union's Obligation:** The Union is obligated to represent its members.

**Potential Risks:**

*   ***Res Judicata* Application:** The central legal risk revolves around the application of *res judicata*. The Supreme Court sided with the NLRC and held that the prior voluntary arbitration decision bars the current claims. The court finds sufficient identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action between the arbitration and the employee's individual claims, as the employees were members of the union when the prior case was filed.
*   **"Law of the Case" Doctrine:** The finality of the voluntary arbitrator's decision created the "law of the case," preventing relitigation of the layoff's legality. *Zebra Security Agency and Allied Services v. NLRC* is cited to support this.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Art. 242):** Confirms the right of a legitimate labor organization (URFA) to represent its members.
*   **Labor Code (Art. 286):**  (Mentioned by petitioners but found to be misapplied) Addresses the obligations upon resumption of operations after a layoff period.
*   ***Davao Free Workers Front v. Court of Industrial Relations:***  Supports the union's right to represent its members without joining each member as a separate party.
*   ***Philippine Land-Air-Sea Labor Union (PLASLU), Inc. v. CIR:***  Outlines the right of union members to withdraw from a case filed by the union.
*   ***Revidad v. NLRC:*** A prior case involving the same layoff event, clarifying that the voluntary arbitration covered all layoffs stemming from the president's directive, not just the initial one.
*   ***Zebra Security Agency and Allied Services v. NLRC:***  Cited to explain the "law of the case" doctrine.
*   ***Nacuray v. NLRC:*** Outlines the four elements necessary for res judicata to apply.
*   ***Sunflower Umbrella Mfg. Co., Inc. v. De Leon:*** Addresses the identity of parties requirement for res judicata.
*   ***Nabus v. Court of Appeals:*** Regarding identity of the cause of action.
*   ***Ibabao v. Intermediate Appellate Court:*** Public policy mandates to end a litigation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Voluntary Arbitration:** The central dispute was whether the voluntary arbitration covered all layoffs resulting from the Presidential Directive or only the initial layoff. The Court accepted AG&P's position that it covered all the layoffs.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court upheld the NLRC's decision, dismissing the petition and affirming the application of *res judicata*. The employees' claims are barred.
