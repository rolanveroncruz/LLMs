**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-15-3342 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3074-P)**

**Case:** Judge Tomas D. Lasam vs. Ronald L. Mamauag, Clerk of Court II, Municipal Trial Court, Rizal, Cagayan.

**Nature:** Administrative case for Serious Dishonesty and Falsification of Official Documents.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Core Issue:** Respondent Mamauag failed to submit DTRs, then submitted DTRs with discrepancies compared to the logbook. Judge Lasam refused certification.
*   **Falsification:** Handwriting in the logbook for the questioned period (Feb-Oct 2008) was not Mamauag's, based on handwriting comparisons. Discrepancies existed between logbook entries and submitted DTRs for time in/out and dates worked. The Court cites specific dates and examples of falsified logbook entries.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Claims of "human miscalculation" and inadvertent deviation from handwriting were rejected as flimsy.
*   **Materiality:** The falsifications relate directly to Mamauag's attendance and potential compensation, making the dishonesty "serious" under A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC.
*   **Jurisprudence/Statutory References:**
    *   **A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC (Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court):**  Defines dishonesty and outlines penalties for serious offenses. Applied retroactively as per Section 24.
    *   **Definition of Dishonesty:**  Cites existing jurisprudence defining dishonesty as intentional false statement, deception, or fraud.
    *   **Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct Committed by Bulaong, 900 Phil. 372 (2021):** Reiterates definition of dishonesty and the need to consider intent.
    *   **Re: Alleged Violation by Mr. Efren Ascrate of Civil Service Rules on Absenteeism and Tardiness, 484 Phil. 426, 435 (2004):** Similar case where falsification of attendance records led to dismissal.
    *   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Almanoche, A.M. No. P-19-3923, January 30, 2024:** Upholds dismissal despite mitigating circumstances due to high ethical standards required of judiciary personnel.
    *   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Jotic, 593 Phil. 8, 16 (2008):** Cites that willful concealment of fact in the logbook constitutes mental dishonesty amounting to misconduct

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Mamauag had a duty to truthfully and accurately record his attendance. His failure to do so constitutes a breach of his obligations as a public servant.
*   Mamauag is held liable for Serious Dishonesty and Falsification of Official Documents.

**Penalties:**

*   Dismissal from service.
*   Forfeiture of all retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits.
*   Disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or -controlled corporations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While a first offense could be considered mitigating, the Court determined that the repeated nature and severity of the falsifications outweighed any potential mitigation.
*   **Subjectivity in Handwriting Analysis:**  Reliance on handwriting comparisons, while supported by testimony, could be subject to challenge, although the Court appeared convinced by the visual evidence.
*   **No direct Evidence of Monetary Gain:** The document doesn't explicitly state that Mamauag gained financially from the falsified records, although the clear implication is that it was to receive unwarranted compensation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the findings of the JIB and the Investigating Judge, finding Mamauag guilty of serious dishonesty and falsification of official documents due to discrepancies between his DTRs and the logbook entries, as well as the finding that the logbook entries during the questioned period were not in his handwriting. The Court emphasized the importance of honesty and integrity in the judiciary and imposed the penalty of dismissal with forfeiture of benefits and disqualification from public office.
