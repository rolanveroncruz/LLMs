**Subject:** Summary of A.M. No. MTJ-08-1697 (Formerly OCA-I.P.I. No. 05-1784-MTJ) - Estanislao v. Avelino

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution in an administrative complaint against Judge Henry B. Avelino.

**Key Issue:** Gross neglect of duty due to undue delay in rendering a pre-trial order in Civil Case No. 405, an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation of A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC, Paragraph 8, Title I (A):** This provision mandates judges to issue a pre-trial order within ten (10) days after the termination of the pre-trial conference. Judge Avelino issued the order over four (4) months after termination.
*   **Rules on Summary Procedure:**  The case was an unlawful detainer case and should have been handled promptly. The delay undermined the purpose of the Rules on Summary Procedure.

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   **Undue Delay in Rendering an Order:** Classified as a less serious charge under Section 9(1), Rule 140, as amended, of the Revised Rules of Court.
*   **Penalty:**  Suspension from office without salary and other benefits for a period of two (2) months.
*   **Warning:**  A repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.
*   **Precedent Penalties:** The Judge had already been fined in A.M. No. MTJ-05-1583 and A.M. No. MTJ-05-1606 for gross inefficiency.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances (Respondent's Argument):**  The judge argued he was prioritizing cases with approaching deadlines under A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC. This defense was rejected.
*   **Procedural Due Process of the Amended Pre-trial Order:** The Complainant alleged lack of notice and opportunity to comment on the Motion for Correction to the Pre-trial order dated 6 February 2006, and the issued Amended Pre-trial Order dated 2 January 2006.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC (Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures), Paragraph 8, Title I (A).**

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court found Judge Avelino liable for undue delay, emphasizing the importance of adhering to procedural timelines, especially in summary procedure cases.  The prior disciplinary actions against the judge were considered in determining the appropriate penalty.
