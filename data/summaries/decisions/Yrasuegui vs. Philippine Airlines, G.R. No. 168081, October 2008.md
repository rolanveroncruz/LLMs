**Case:** *Armando G. Yrasuegui v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.* G.R. No. 168081, October 17, 2008.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of a Philippine Airlines (PAL) international flight steward, Yrasuegui, for failing to meet the airline's weight standards. While affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, the Court *modified* it to include separation pay for Yrasuegui.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Grounds for Dismissal (Art. 282(e), Labor Code):** The Court determined that Yrasuegui's failure to maintain his weight constituted an "analogous cause" under Article 282(e) of the Labor Code, justifying dismissal. The Court considered the safety standards of the airlines and reasonable weight requirements for flight crew. The court rejected his claim that obesity is an illness.
*   **Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ):** The Court held that PAL's weight standards are a valid BFOQ, as they are reasonably related to the essential operation of ensuring passenger safety. The Court applied a test of reasonableness akin to BFOQ, emphasizing the importance of crew agility and mobility in emergency situations. The court held that overweight cabin attendants impeded passengers.
*   **Discrimination:** The Court dismissed Yrasuegui's claim of discrimination, stating he failed to provide substantial evidence that other overweight employees were treated differently under similar circumstances.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employee's Obligation:** To comply with reasonable company standards, including weight requirements, when such standards are a continuing qualification for employment.
*   **Employer's Right:** To terminate employment for failure to meet valid BFOQs and other analogous causes as outlined in the Labor Code.
*   **PAL's Liability:** While the dismissal was deemed legal, PAL was ordered to pay separation pay as an act of social justice, since the dismissal was not for serious misconduct and did not reflect on the employee's moral character.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Analogous Cause":** The interpretation of "analogous cause" under Article 282(e) may be subject to varying interpretations and potential challenges in future cases. Employers must demonstrate a clear and rational connection between the employee's deficiency and the employer's business needs (e.g., safety).
*   **BFOQ Application:** The application of BFOQ requires careful consideration of the specific job requirements and a factual basis for believing that a disqualifying characteristic (in this case, being overweight) would prevent performance of the job duties.
*   **Enforcement:** The order for separation pay will require calculation and potential enforcement.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Nadura v. Benguet Consolidated, Inc.* (G.R. No. L-17780, August 24, 1962, 5 SCRA 879): Distinguished; deemed inapplicable due to differences in factual circumstances and the absence of flight safety considerations.
*   *British Columbia Public Service Employee Commission (BSPSERC) v. The British Columbia Government and Service Employee's Union (BCGSEU)* (3 SCR 3 (1999)): Cited for the "Meiorin Test" for determining employment standards.
*   *Star Paper Corporation v. Simbol* (G.R. No. 164774, April 12, 2006, 487 SCRA 228):  Cited for the test of reasonableness of company policy.
*  *Duncan Association of Detailman-PTGWTO v. Glaxo Wellcome Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 162994, September 17, 2004, 438 SCRA 343):  Company policy regarding employees of rival companies can be reasonable.
*   *Western Air Lines v. Criswell* (472 US 400 (1985)): Distinguished; age-based BFOQ and overweight are not the same.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines, Article 282(e):** Termination by employer, analogous causes.
*   **Republic Act No. 7277 (Magna Carta for Disabled Persons):** Cited, containing provisions similar to BFOQ, in addition to the Constitution and the Labor Code.
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code** An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages.
*  **Article 223 of the Labor Code** The decision of the Labor Arbiter reinstating a dismissed or separated employee, insofar as the reinstatement aspect is concerned, shall immediately be executory, even pending appeal

**Conclusion:**

The ruling confirms the employer's right to enforce reasonable weight standards as a BFOQ for flight attendants, emphasizing passenger safety. However, it underscores the need for a rational nexus between the weight standard and job performance. The requirement of separation pay balances employer rights with social justice considerations.
