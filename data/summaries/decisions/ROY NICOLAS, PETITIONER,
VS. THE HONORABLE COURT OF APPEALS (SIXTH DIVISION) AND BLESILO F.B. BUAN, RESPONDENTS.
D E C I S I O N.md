**Legal Document Summary: *Roy Nicolas v. Court of Appeals and Blesilo F.B. Buan***

**Case Citation:** 351 Phil. 548 (G.R. No. 122857, March 27, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision, involving a collection of sum of money suit based on a Portfolio Management Agreement.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Portfolio Management Agreement (PMA):** Nicolas (Portfolio Manager) managed Buan's (Investor) stock transactions.
    *   **Management Fee:** 20% of "realized profits" payable monthly.
    *   Automatic Renewal Clause: Initial 3-month term, but terminated early by Buan.
*   **Revised Securities Act (RSA):** Brokers must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Liabilities:**

*   Nicolas claimed Buan owed P68,263.67 in management fees. RTC initially ruled in Nicolas's favor.
*   CA reversed, finding Nicolas failed to prove "realized profits" as defined in the PMA. CA rejected Nicolas' claim of entitlement to fees due to lack of proof in stock trade profitability.
*   Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Realized Profits":** The agreement did not explicitly define "realized profits." This ambiguity was key to the dispute. The court adopted a standard dictionary definition.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The profit and loss statements submitted by Nicolas were deemed insufficient. They lacked specific transaction details, proper authentication, were self-serving and did not convincingly prove the existence of "realized profits".
*   **Unlicensed Broker:** The Supreme Court emphasized that Nicolas was trading securities without the required SEC license, thus a lack of entitlement to claim fees based on the violation of Section 19 of the Revised Securities Act.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Securities Act (RSA), Section 19:** Prohibits selling securities without SEC registration. The Supreme Court used this to support its decision that Nicolas could not recover fees.
*   **RSA Rule 19-13:** Mandates reasonable and non-discriminatory charges for services performed by brokers.
*   **People vs. Agripa, 208 SCRA 589:** Mere admissibility of evidence does not guarantee credibility.
*   **Del Mundo v. Court of Appeals, 240 SCRA 348 (1995); Baliwag Transit Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 256 SCRA 746 (1996):** Damages must be proven with certainty.
*   **Securities and Exchange Commission v. Court of Appeals, 246 SCRA 738 (1995):** Purpose of the RSA is to protect the public and strengthen securities mechanism.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The PMA lacked a precise definition of "realized profits," leading to the central dispute.
*   The agreement didn't specify the required level of documentation for profit and loss statements.

**Legal Analysis & Risks for Nicolas:**

*   Nicolas bore the burden of proof to demonstrate "realized profits." His self-prepared statements were insufficient and lacked credibility.
*   Operating as an unlicensed broker exposes Nicolas to potential penalties under the RSA.
*   Nicolas's claim was effectively a claim for damages, which required a higher degree of proof, which was not satisfied.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, dismissing Nicolas's complaint. Key factors included the lack of credible evidence proving "realized profits," the ambiguity of the term "realized profits" in the PMA, and Nicolas's operation as an unlicensed broker in violation of the RSA. The case highlights the importance of clear contractual definitions and compliance with regulatory requirements in financial agreements.
