## Legal Document Summary: *Ferdinand V. Sevilla v. COMELEC and Ranie B. Gupit* (G.R. No. 227797)

**Document Type:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines (En Banc) on a Petition for Certiorari.

**Core Issue:** Validity of the COMELEC's decision affirming the MCTC's annulment of the proclamation of Ferdinand V. Sevilla as Punong Barangay and declaration of Ranie B. Gupit as the duly elected official.  The dispute centers on the appreciation of contested ballots.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Election Protest:** Ranie B. Gupit filed an election protest with the MCTC after losing by one vote (466 to 465).
*   **MCTC Decision:** Annulled Sevilla's proclamation, declared Gupit the winner (464 to 463) after ballot revision.
*   **COMELEC First Division Resolution:** Affirmed the MCTC decision, appreciating the contested ballots.
*   **COMELEC En Banc Resolution:** Denied Sevilla's Motion for Reconsideration, affirming the First Division. The En Banc conducted its own appreciation of the contested ballots.
*   **Contested Ballots:** The case hinges on the appreciation of four specific ballots:
    *   **Exhibit "I":** Vote for "Nanie G." credited to Gupit under the *idem sonans* rule (Section 211(7), Omnibus Election Code). Sevilla argued that "Nanie" could refer to another candidate (Ballaga) and that, he should not have been credited with the vote under that provision.
    *   **Exhibit "F":** Vote with Sevilla's nickname "Eboy" written above "Punong Barangay" and the name "Ale" in the Punong Barangay slot.  Declined as stray vote. Sevilla argued for validity under the neighborhood and intent rules.
    *   **Exhibit "R-4":** Declared invalid because it was deemed "written by two persons" ("WBT"), that is, written by two people on the ballot. Sevilla argued it was one person's handwriting and the "Written by Two" Rule should not apply.
    *   **Exhibit "II":** Declared stray due to illegibility.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **COMELEC:** To properly appreciate ballots in accordance with the Omnibus Election Code (B.P. Blg. 881), aiming to ascertain voter intent.
*   **Petitioner (Sevilla):** Burden of proving grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code):** Primary statutory basis for election rules and ballot appreciation. Specifically, Section 211 provides the rules for ballot appreciation.
    *   **Section 211(7):** *Idem Sonans* rule.
    *   **Section 211(19):** Stray vote rule.
*   **Idem Sonans Rule:**  Applied in *Batalla v. COMELEC* (615 Phil. 805, 830 (2009)) as one of the rules in resolving contested ballots and as a guiding principle in appreciating ballots.
*   **Neighborhood Rule:** Referenced regarding Exhibit F, where a candidate's name not in the proper space, but preceded by the office, can be counted, as cited in *Batalla v. COMELEC*, 615 Phil. 805, 825.
*   **Intent Rule:** Referenced regarding Exhibit F, where the ballot appreciation objective should be to ascertain and implement the voter's intention, if determined with reasonable certainty, as cited in *Batalla v. COMELEC*, 615 Phil. 805, 825.
*   **Written by Two Rule:**  Relied upon to invalidate Exhibit R-4, as discussed in *Torres v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal* (404 Phil. 125, 143 (2001)).
*   **Typoco v. COMELEC** (628 Phil. 288 (2010)) highlights the principle of finality of COMELEC findings of fact supported by substantial evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity in Ballot Appreciation:** Ballot appreciation involves an element of subjectivity, potentially leading to allegations of bias or misinterpretation.
*   **One-Vote Margin:** The extremely close election result amplifies the impact of each disputed ballot, increasing scrutiny and potential for legal challenges.
*   **Application of *Idem Sonans* Rule:** While the COMELEC applied the *idem sonans* rule to credit "Nanie G." to Gupit, the existence of another candidate with a similar name ("Nanie" Ballaga) could be viewed as creating ambiguity and undermining the application of the rule.
*   **Application of "Written by Two" Rule:** Application can depend on subjective assessment of handwriting, and a layperson may not easily understand the complexities involved in handwriting analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's decision, finding no grave abuse of discretion.  The key takeaways are the strict interpretation of ballot appreciation rules and the deference given to the COMELEC's factual findings when supported by substantial evidence. Sevilla's petition failed because he could not demonstrate that the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in its interpretation of the contested ballots. The Supreme Court noted that factual findings of the COMELEC which are supported by substantial evidence are generally binding on the Court.
