**Legal Document Summary: *Hrs. of Lim v. Presiding Judge***

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment in a land title reconstitution case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Reconstitution of Title:** Respondent Cañosa successfully petitioned for reconstitution of TCT No. 169395 after the original was destroyed.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners (Hrs. of Lim) allege that the reconstituted title overlaps with their existing title, TCT No. RT-97223, and that the reconstitution process suffered from extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Court of Appeals' Ruling:** Dismissed the petition, finding that the properties claimed by petitioners and respondent Cañosa are distinct, precluding the petition for annulment.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirms dismissal, holding that petitioners lack standing as they are not real parties-in-interest because their land is different and not within the reconstituted property.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation of Petitioner:** To prove their interest/ownership in the land affected by the reconstitution. This was not done.
*   **Liability of Petitioner:** They are liable for the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** The Court notes that Petitioners' challenge could be construed as a prohibited collateral attack on Respondent's reconstituted title. This potentially creates a res judicata problem if they pursue separate ownership claims. The court also said CA has no jurisdiction to try questions of ownership.
*   **Spurious Titles Claim** The lower court insinuates that petitioners' title is spurious
*   **Extrinsic Fraud Argument:** While dismissed in this context, the allegation of extrinsic fraud (failure to comply with RA 26 requirements) in the reconstitution proceedings could be resurrected in a *direct* action, if standing could be established. However, the Court's review of the record indicated that jurisdictional requirements were in fact complied with.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 47 of the Rules of Court:** Governs annulment of judgments. Section 2 defines grounds, Section 5 allows for dismissal of petitions without merit, Section 6 outlines procedure.
*   **Republic Act No. 26:**  Relates to the reconstitution of lost or destroyed titles. Sections 12 and 13 address notice requirements in such proceedings.
*   **Real Party in Interest Doctrine:**  Ortigas & Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals, et al., 400 Phil. 615, 625 (2000), and BPI Family Bank v. Buenaventura, G.R. No. 148196, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 431, 442, are cited to define "real party in interest" and the need for "material interest."
*   **Collateral Attack Doctrine:** Carreon v. Court of Appeals, 353 Phil. 271, 283 (1998) establishes that a certificate of title can only be altered in a direct proceeding.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core issue of ownership of the disputed area remains unresolved, potentially requiring separate litigation.
*   Spuriousness of title claim could be contentious

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision strengthens the finality of reconstitution proceedings, provided jurisdictional requirements are met. It also clarifies the requirement of standing in petitions for annulment of judgment. However, the underlying land dispute remains, presenting a risk of further litigation. A thorough title search and survey comparison are recommended to assess the validity of the titles and potential causes of action.
