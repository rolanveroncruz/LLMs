**Case Summary: Manila Hotel Corporation v. Rosita De Leon, G.R. No. 219774, July 23, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the NLRC and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's (LA) decision finding illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:**  Whether Rosita De Leon's (Respondent) compulsory retirement by Manila Hotel Corporation (Petitioner) constituted illegal dismissal.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that Respondent was illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Retirement:** Art. 287 of the Labor Code governs retirement. Retirement age is primarily determined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) or applicable employment contract.  In the absence of an agreement, the compulsory retirement age is 65, with an optional retirement age of 60.
*   **Management Prerogative:**  Employers have broad discretion in managing their affairs, but this is hemmed in by good faith and due consideration of employee rights.
*   **Security of Tenure (Art. 279, Labor Code):**  An employee can only be terminated for just cause or authorized causes. An employee unjustly dismissed is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority and full backwages. Reinstatement is no longer applicable and respondent shall receive separation pay in lieu of actual reinstatement

**Liabilities & Monetary Awards:**

*   **Backwages:**  Petitioner ordered to pay backwages from June 10, 2011, until the finality of the SC decision, plus interest (12% per annum from June 10, 2011, to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full satisfaction).
*   **Separation Pay:** Petitioner ordered to pay separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement) from September 1, 1976, until the finality of the SC decision, equivalent to one month's pay for every year of service, plus interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.
*   **Illegal Deductions & Attorney's Fees:**  Petitioner must pay Php72,616.77 for illegal deductions, and Php7,261.67 for attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Agreement to CBA:** The core risk for the hotel was the failure to establish a clear agreement with the Respondent to be bound by the CBA's early retirement provisions.  Respondent never explicitly agreed to the early retirement age stipulated in the CBA.
*   **Managerial Status:** Petitioner never contested Respondent's managerial status.  Managerial employees are generally outside the scope of CBA concessions unless there is a specific agreement. *United Pepsi-Cola Supervisory Union v. Judge Laguesma*, 351 Phil. 244 (1998) was cited.
*   **"Notice" vs. "Offer":** The SC characterized the June 6, 2011 letter as a *notice* of compulsory retirement, not an *offer* that Respondent could accept or reject. This was a crucial point, as the Court emphasized that the notice lacked any invitation for discussion or opportunity for Respondent to decline.
*   **Implied Agreement/Estoppel:** Petitioner's argument that Respondent's processing of her clearance implied acceptance of the retirement offer was rejected. The court noted the unequal footing between employer and employee.
*   **Voluntariness of Retirement:** Citing *Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corp. v. Caballeda, et al.*, 582 Phil. 118 (2008), the court pointed to the filing of the illegal dismissal complaint as evidence that the retirement was not voluntary.

**Conclusion:**

The Manila Hotel Corporation was found liable for illegally dismissing Rosita De Leon because it failed to prove a voluntary and explicit agreement by the Respondent to retire early under the terms of the CBA. The Court emphasized that the management's prerogative to retire an employee is limited by law and employee rights, particularly security of tenure.
