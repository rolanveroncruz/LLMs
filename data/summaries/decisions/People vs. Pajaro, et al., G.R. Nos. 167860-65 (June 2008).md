**Case Summary: *People v. Pajaro, Aben, and Libertad*, G.R. Nos. 167860-65 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Sandiganbayan decision finding appellants guilty of four counts of malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents (Art. 217 in relation to Art. 171, RPC) and two counts of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

**Facts:**

*   Appellants Pajaro (Mayor), Aben (Acting Municipal Accountant), and Libertad (Municipal Treasurer) allegedly irregularly disbursed public funds for livelihood projects and IEC-Peace and Order Programs between September 1997 and March 1998.
*   State Auditor Tero's audit revealed that some intended beneficiaries did not receive the funds (P74,000), and the disbursements were irregularly processed, bypassing the Municipal Budget Officer.
*   Vouchers lacked required certification from the budget officer.
*   Accusations included falsification of signatures of beneficiaries Anecito Penar and Angelita Lacerna on disbursement vouchers.
*   Appellants argued disbursements followed Resolutions of the Sangguniang Bayan and Municipal Development Council, and accounting lapses were corrected.

**Sandiganbayan Holding:** Found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

*   Sentenced to varying prison terms and fines for Malversation and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).
*   Ordered perpetual special disqualification and joint and several indemnity of the government for P319,000.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Malversation (Art. 217, RPC):** Elements established include: (1) Public officers (Pajaro, Aben, Libertad); (2) Custody/control of funds (Libertad); (3) Public funds; (4) Misappropriation/consent to another taking the funds.  Pajaro and Aben implicated through conspiracy with accountable officer Libertad. *Barriga v. Sandiganbayan* case law cited for establishing conspiracy leading to malversation.
*   **Falsification of Public Documents (Art. 171, RPC):** Relates to falsified signatures of beneficiaries. The Sandiganbayan decision hinged on the discrepancies in the signatures of the beneficiaries. The court considered the testimonial and documentary evidence.
*   **Violation of Section 3(e), RA 3019 (Anti-Graft):** Elements: (1) Public officer; (2) Manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; (3) Undue injury to the government/unwarranted benefit to a private party.
*   **COA Circular 92-382:** The COA rules require certification from the budget officer (Section 57) before disbursements can be made (Section 38). The rules define the procedure for the disbursement of public or local funds (Sections 57, 58, and 59).
*   **Conspiracy:** Established through the actions of the appellants before, during, and after the crime. *People v. Garcia* case law cited on inferring conspiracy from conduct. The acts of the appellants constitute evidence of a joint purpose and concerted action
*   **Undue Injury/Unwarranted Benefit (Sec. 3(e) RA 3019):** The court considered the substantial injury suffered and the benefit received, which are sufficient and do not need to be precisely measured (*Fonacier v. Sandiganbayan*).
*   **The Sandiganbayan** has jurisdiction over high-ranking public officials, making them subject to prosecution for corruption offenses.

**Appellants' Arguments:**

*   Disbursements were based on approved resolutions.
*   Unjustified refusal by the budget officer to certify the documents.
*   Contradictory statements by Penar and Lacerna undermine their credibility.
*   Lack of expert testimony on signature falsification.

**Court's Rejection of Arguments:**

*   Lack of evidence of administrative action against the budget officer.
*   Cash disbursements violated COA Circular 92-382.
*   Contradictions in affidavits do not necessarily impair credibility; testimony in court is given more weight.
*   Signatures were obviously different; expert opinion was unnecessary.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy:** Requires a strong evidentiary link between the individual actions of the appellants.  A potential defense could focus on demonstrating independent, non-collusive actions.
*   **Interpretation of "manifest partiality" and "evident bad faith":**  These are subjective standards. Defenses can argue that the actions, even if irregular, were not driven by malice or intent to defraud.
*   **Reliance on Testimonial Evidence:** The credibility of witnesses is always a point of contention.
*   **Lack of Budget Officer Certification:** The failure to follow procedure set out by the COA circular provides an inference of corruption

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's decision, finding the appellants guilty based on the evidence presented, including the irregularities in the disbursements, falsified signatures, and violations of COA regulations.
