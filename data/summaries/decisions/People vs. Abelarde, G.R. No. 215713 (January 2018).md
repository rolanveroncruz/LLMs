## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Abelarde*, G.R. No. 215713

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision reverses the Court of Appeals' (CA) ruling, acquitting Bobby S. Abelarde of charges for violating Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), also known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, specifically .03 grams of shabu in the sale case and .24 grams of shabu in the possession case.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation of RA 9165, Sec. 5 (Illegal Sale):** Charges stemmed from a buy-bust operation where the accused allegedly sold 0.03 grams of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer. Conviction required proving identity of buyer and seller, the transaction, and existence of the corpus delicti (the drugs).
*   **Violation of RA 9165, Sec. 11 (Illegal Possession):** Charges stemmed from a search after arrest, where the accused was allegedly found with 0.24 grams of *shabu*. Conviction required proving intent to possess and identity of drug.
*   **Chain of Custody Requirements (RA 9165, Sec. 21):** The core issue. The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of Section 21 of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), requiring strict adherence to procedures for handling seized drugs. Critical requirements include:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photographing of the drugs after seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official during inventory and photographing.
    *   Signatures of these individuals on the inventory, with copies provided to them.
    *   Meticulous documentation of the movement and custody of the seized drugs, including identification and signatures of custodians.
*   **Application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The appellate court had modified the sentence for the Section 11 violation (possession) applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Failures in Chain of Custody:**

The Court identified critical failures in the prosecution's evidence regarding the chain of custody:

*   **First Link (Seizure to Handling):** Failure to establish who handled and took custody of the seized packets of *shabu* immediately after the arrest. No evidence of who held it from time of confiscation to delivery to PCI Salinas.
*   **Second Link (Buy-Bust Team to Investigator):** Lack of evidence regarding the turnover of the *shabu* from the buy-bust team to the police investigator. Failure to identify who made the markings on the packets and when/where, also failure to identify the person submitting shabu to the police investigator.
*   **Third Link (Police Investigator to Crime Lab):** No testimony regarding the custody of the *shabu* at the PNP Crime Laboratory, including who delivered it and whether PCI Salinas (forensic chemist) took direct custody upon arrival.
*   **Fourth Link (Compliance with DDB Regulations):** Lack of evidence showing compliance with Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) Regulation No. 2, Series of 2004, which mandates documentation of the chain of custody within the laboratory and identification of individuals handling the specimen.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Minimal Quantity of Drugs:** The small quantities of drugs involved (.03 grams and .24 grams) increase the risk of tampering, alteration, or substitution, necessitating stricter adherence to chain of custody procedures. (Referenced from the case itself: "This is especially true when only a minuscule amount of dangerous drugs is alleged to have been taken from the accused.")
*   **Reliance on One Witness:** The prosecution's reliance on a single witness (SPO1 Selibio) amplified the impact of his incomplete and deficient testimony regarding chain of custody.
*   **Saving Clause Not Applied:** The Court held that the "saving clause" in Section 21(a) of the IRR of RA 9165 (allowing for justifiable non-compliance if integrity is preserved) could not be applied because the prosecution failed to acknowledge and explain the lapses in procedure.

**Conclusion:**

The accused was acquitted because the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proving the integrity and identity of the *corpus delicti* (the drugs) due to significant breaks in the chain of custody, violating the mandatory requirements of RA 9165, Section 21. The court deemed the lapses were too egregious to ignore, creating doubt about the evidence presented.
