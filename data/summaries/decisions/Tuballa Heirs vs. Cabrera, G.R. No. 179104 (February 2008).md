## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Tuballa v. Cabrera, G.R. No. 179104 (2008)*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a typographical error in lower court decisions concerning land ownership and recovery of possession.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over Lot No. 5697 (incorrectly stated as 6597 in lower courts) located in Bondo, Siaton, Negros Oriental, covered by OCT No. FV-16880.
*   **RTC Decision (1994):** Ordered Cabrera Enterprises to vacate Lot No. *6597* (typographical error) and awarded damages and attorney's fees to Anastacio Tuballa.
*   **CA Decision (2002):** Affirmed the RTC Decision, but deleted the awards for damages and attorney's fees. Decision became final on March 7, 2003.
*   **Issue:** Whether the RTC had the authority to correct the typographical error in the affirmed CA decision.
*   **SC Ruling:**  Reiterates the principle of *immutability of final judgments*, but acknowledges exceptions, including *correction of clerical errors*.  SC modifies the RTC decision to correct "Lot No. 6597" to "Lot No. 5697".

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Cabrera Enterprises:** Obligated to vacate Lot No. 5697 and turn over possession to the Heirs of Tuballa.  The original award of damages and attorney's fees by the RTC was overturned by the CA and is not reinstated.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Finality & Immutability vs. Typographical Error:** The central issue revolved around the conflict between the principle of finality of judgments and the recognized exception for correcting clerical errors.  The SC navigates this by classifying the incorrect lot number as a simple clerical error.
*   **No Damages:** Note that while the land possession issue is resolved, Cabrera Enterprises is *not* liable for damages or attorney fees because those were deleted on appeal.
*   **Jurisdictional Question:** The RTC initially believed it lacked jurisdiction to correct the CA's affirmed error.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Principle of Immutability of Final Judgments:**  Cited cases include *Collantes v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 169604 (2007)* and *Pe√±a v. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), G.R. No. 159520 (2006).*
*   **Exceptions to Immutability:** Reference to *Ramos v. Ramos, 447 Phil. 114 (2003)*, outlining the exceptions to the immutability rule.
*   **Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. FV-16880:** Primary evidence establishing the correct lot number.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The legal document does not include the details that suggest why cabrera was being sued for the land in the first place.
