**Case Summary: *William Ong Genato v. Benjamin Bayhon, et al.* (G.R. No. 171035, August 24, 2009)**

This case involves a consolidated action stemming from two civil cases: one for the nullification of a *dacion en pago* (Civil Case No. Q-90-7012) and another for specific performance of the same *dacion en pago* (Civil Case No. Q-90-7551). The dispute arose from a Php 1,000,000.00 loan extended by Petitioner Genato to Respondent Bayhon.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Loan:** Respondent Benjamin Bayhon obtained a Php 1,000,000.00 loan from Petitioner Genato with a stipulated interest rate of 5% per month and a 3% penalty for non-payment.

*   ***Dacion en Pago***:  The Court affirmed the Court of Appeals ruling that the *dacion en pago* was void *ab initio* because it was a simulated/fictitious contract. A key factual finding was that Bayhon's wife, who purportedly signed the document, was already deceased at the time of its execution. *Article 1409 of the Civil Code* on void contracts was cited.

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** The Court of Appeals also declared the real estate mortgage void due to the death of Bayhon's wife.

*   **Novation (RTC Finding):** The RTC found that the *dacion en pago* had been novated due to subsequent payments made by the Respondent, but this was not addressed by the Court.

*   **Liability of Estate:** The Court of Appeals erroneously extinguished Bayhon's obligation upon his death. The Supreme Court clarified that while Bayhon himself could no longer be compelled to pay, his debt subsists against his estate. *Article 1311 of the Civil Code* regarding the transmissibility of contractual obligations to heirs was cited, along with *Articles 774 and 776* on succession. *Estate of Hemady v. Luzon Surety Co., Inc.* (100 Phil. 388) was also cited.

*   **Interest Rate:** The RTC's imposition of 5% monthly (60% annually) interest was deemed unconscionable.

*   **Remedy:** The Court directed the Petitioner to file a claim against the estate of Benjamin Bayhon pursuant to *Rule 3, Section 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Estate of Benjamin Bayhon is liable for the principal loan amount less partial payments, plus legal interest.
*   Petitioner Genato must file a claim against the estate to recover the debt.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Estate Assets:**  Petitioner's ability to recover the debt is contingent on the value of the assets in Bayhon's estate.  *Art. 1311, par. 1 of the Civil Code states The heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received from the decedent.*
*   **Competing Claims:** Other creditors may exist, potentially diminishing the amount recoverable by the Petitioner.
*   **Legal Interest Computation:** The Court applied a 12% per annum interest rate from October 3, 1989 (date of extrajudicial demand). The Eastern Shipping Lines formula was cited. The specific method of calculation and its application to the remaining balance after partial payments could be a point of contention.
*   **Validity of Debt/Lack of Security:** With the court's ruling that the Real Estate Mortgage and Dacion en Pago being invalid the Petitioner has a higher burden to get satisfaction of the debt through the probate court.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Articles 774, 776, 1311, 1409
*   Rules of Civil Procedure: Rule 3, Section 20

**Case Law:**

*   *Estate of Hemady v. Luzon Surety Co., Inc.* (100 Phil. 388) - Transmissibility of contractual obligations.
*   *Eastern Shipping Lines v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994) - Legal interest rate.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The validity of the novation, initially found by the RTC, was not addressed by the Supreme Court and may be raised by either party during probate proceedings.

**Recommendations:**

*   Immediately initiate probate proceedings to file a claim against Bayhon's estate.
*   Thoroughly investigate the assets of the estate to determine the likelihood of full recovery.
*   Prepare for potential challenges from other creditors or disputes regarding the computation of interest and valuation of estate assets.
*   Consult with probate counsel to navigate the complexities of estate administration and creditor claims.
