Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Mariano Tanenglian v. Silvestre Lorenzo, et al.*, G.R. No. 173415, March 28, 2008 (573 Phil. 472)

**Nature:** Appeal by Certiorari under Rule 45 seeking reversal of CA Resolutions dismissing Petitioner's Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari; whether the Regional Adjudicator had jurisdiction to declare the subject land as ancestral land and annul petitioner's titles.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner (Tanenglian) owns land covered by Torrens Titles (TCT Nos. T-29281 and T-29282).
*   Respondents (Lorenzo, et al.), members of an Indigenous Cultural Minority, filed a Petition with the DARAB for Redemption under Sec. 12 of RA 3844, declaration as ancestral land under Sec. 9 of RA 6657, nullification of Petitioner’s TCTs, and disturbance compensation.
*   Regional Adjudicator ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring the land as ancestral, ordering DAR acquisition for distribution to Respondents, and cancellation of Petitioner’s TCTs.
*   Petitioner's appeal to DARAB was denied for late payment of appeal fee.
*   Petitioner filed Petition for Certiorari with DARAB, which was denied.
*   Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals, which dismissed it, stating the proper remedy was a Petition for Review under Rule 43 and that it was filed out of time.

**Holding:** Supreme Court granted Tanenglian’s petition and reversed the CA ruling and set aside the Regional Adjudicator’s decision.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The Court acknowledged Petitioner's delay of one day in paying the appeal fee to the DARAB but ruled that the CA should have been lenient. Citing *Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Mangubat* for factors justifying relaxed application of rules.  Failure to abide by the rules should be explained to merit exception.
*   **Remedy for DARAB Decisions:** The Court agreed with the CA that the proper remedy for appealing DARAB decisions is a Petition for Review under Rule 43, not Certiorari under Rule 65, citing *Nippon Paint Employees Union-Olalia v. Court of Appeals*. The court reiterated that a Petition for Certiorari should not be used as a substitute for a lost appeal.
*   **Exceptions to Procedural Rules:** The Court stated that the CA should have treated the Petition as one for review because in certain cases, like this one, rules of procedure can be relaxed to prevent injustice; citing *Sebastian v. Morales*.
*   **Jurisdiction of DARAB:**  The Court held that DARAB jurisdiction requires a tenancy relationship, citing *Suarez v. Saul* and *Heirs of Rafael Magpily v. De Jesus*. The court found that since the Regional Adjudicator himself acknowledged no tenancy relationship, the DARAB lacked jurisdiction, and the case should have been brought before the Regular Courts.
*   **Ancestral Land Declaration:** The Court found that the Regional Adjudicator lacked jurisdiction to declare the land ancestral. Jurisdiction over delineation and recognition of ancestral domains is conferred on the NCIP under RA 8371 (Indigenous People's Rights Act), citing Sec. 3(a) and (b).
*   **Collateral Attack on Torrens Title:** The Court stated that the Adjudicator lacked jurisdiction to nullify Petitioner’s TCTs; this constituted an improper collateral attack. Finality of Decision in G.R. No. 118515 is binding upon respondents that were parties therein. Citing *Abad v. Government of the Philippines* that once a decree of registration is made under the Torrens System, and the reglementary period has passed within which the decree may be questioned, the title is perfected and cannot be collaterally questioned later on. The decision also cites *Tambunting, Jr. v. Sumabat*, stating that the decision rendered without jurisdiction is void.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision's emphasis on substantial justice *despite* procedural errors could create uncertainty in future DARAB appeals. While the one-day delay was excused here, other cases will need to be judged on their specific facts to determine whether a similar deviation from rules is justified.
*   While RA 8371 vests jurisdiction for ancestral land delineation in NCIP, there may still be disputes regarding the application of this rule, particularly in cases with pre-existing titles.
*   The decision indicates the potential for direct challenges to the TCTs, opening up the possibility of future litigation.
