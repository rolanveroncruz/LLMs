## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Haloc* (G.R. No. 227312, September 05, 2018)

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision affirms the CA's conviction of Jessie Haloc y Codon for murder (Art. 248, RPC) of a 4-year-old and attempted murder of a 9-year-old. Haloc raised the defense of insanity (Art. 12, RPC), which was rejected by both the RTC and CA. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings and adjusted the civil liabilities to conform with *People v. Jugueta*.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crimes:** Murder and Attempted Murder (Art. 248, RPC; defining murder including attendant circumstances like treachery).
*   **Treachery:** The court highlights the doctrine that an attack on a child constitutes treachery *per se* due to the victim's vulnerability, rendering resistance impossible (citing *People v. Sanchez*, *People v. Cabarrubias*).
*   **Insanity Defense (Art. 12, RPC):**
    *   The Court reiterates the high bar for proving insanity as an exempting circumstance: requires a **complete deprivation of intelligence**, not merely abnormality of mental faculties (citing *People v. Isla*, *People v. Estrada*). The test is of cognition - whether the accused was incapable of entertaining criminal intent or deprived of reason.
    *   The burden of proof lies with the accused to prove insanity with clear and convincing evidence (citing *People v. Pantoja*). It is a confession and avoidance.
    *   The Court uses definition of insanity under Section 1039 of the Revised Administrative Code which is a "manifestation in language or conduct, of disease or defect of the brain, or a more or less permanently diseased or disordered condition of the mentality, functional or organic, and characterized by perversion, inhibition, or by disordered function of the sensory or of the intellective faculties, or by impaired or disordered volition."
    *   Evidence of prior mental illness and treatment is insufficient to establish insanity at the *time* of the crime (drawing on *People v. Dungo*, quoting *People v. Bonoan* re: evidence of insanity having reference to mental condition at time of the act). Haloc's recognition of his sister and voluntary surrender of the bolo after the attack undermined his claim.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Mental condition was not shown to have diminished the exercise of his will power hence no mitigating circumstance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Affirmed conviction for Murder (Reclusion Perpetua) and Attempted Murder (indeterminate sentence).
*   **Civil Liabilities (Modified based on *People v. Jugueta*):**
    *   Heirs of Arnel de la Cruz (Murder):  ₱75,000 civil indemnity, ₱75,000 moral damages, ₱75,000 exemplary damages.
    *   Allan de la Cruz (Attempted Murder): ₱25,000 civil indemnity, ₱25,000 moral damages, ₱25,000 exemplary damages.
    *   Interest: 6% per annum on all civil liabilities from finality of the decision until full settlement.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Complete Deprivation of Intelligence":** The definition of insanity and the interpretation of evidence to meet this high standard leave room for subjective judgment by the courts.
*   **Lack of definitive test or criterion for insanity**: The court refers to cases and definition in the Revised Administrative Code, there is a risk of misinterpretation.
*   **Defense Strategy and Expert Witness:** The prosecution did not present evidence. The weakness of the defense hinged on the lack of clear and convincing evidence demonstrating Haloc's insanity *at the precise moment* of the crimes. The expert testimony presented was insufficient to prove a total deprivation of intelligence, focusing instead on the nature of his mental illness rather than its impact on his cognitive abilities during the hacking.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 12 (Exempting Circumstances), Art. 14 (Aggravating Circumstances), Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Revised Administrative Code, Section 1039

**Case Law References:**

*   People v. Jugueta (G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016) - For the guidelines on award of civil liabilities
*   People v. Sanchez, People v. Cabarrubias - Used to determine the definition of treachery
*   People v. Pantoja - Burden of proof for asserting exempting circumstances
*   People v. Isla, People v. Estrada - For the definition of insanity
*   People v. Dungo, quoting People v. Bonoan - Evidence of insanity

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on the definition of treachery is a settled point of law, however its strict application might be questioned in cases where the victim is of an older age.
