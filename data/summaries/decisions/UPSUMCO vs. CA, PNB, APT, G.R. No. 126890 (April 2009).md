## Legal Document Summary: UPSUMCO vs. CA, PNB, and APT (G.R. No. 126890)

**Document Type:** Resolution on a Second Motion for Reconsideration

**Core Issue:** Dispute over the extent and effectivity date of a condonation of debt granted by Asset Privatization Trust (APT) to United Planters Sugar Milling Co., Inc. (UPSUMCO) concerning loans initially held by Philippine National Bank (PNB).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Credit Agreements:** UPSUMCO obtained "take-off loans" from PNB secured by real estate and chattel mortgages.  UPSUMCO was also required to open deposit accounts with PNB, granting PNB a right of set-off.
*   **Operational Loans:** UPSUMCO contracted additional "operational loans" from PNB, also with set-off clauses and secured by pledges of sugar produce.
*   **Deed of Transfer (PNB to Government/APT):** PNB transferred its "rights, titles, and interests" over UPSUMCO (including the loans) to the government, which then transferred these rights to APT. (Presidential Proclamation No. 50).
*   **Foreclosure Sale:** APT foreclosed on the real estate and chattel mortgages, purchasing the assets for P450 million.
*   **Deed of Assignment (UPSUMCO to APT, Sept. 3, 1987):** UPSUMCO assigned its right to redeem the foreclosed properties to APT in exchange for APT "condoning any deficiency amount it may be entitled to recover from the Corporation under the Credit Agreement dated November 5, 1974, and the Restructuring Agreement[s] dated June 24 and December 10, 1982, and May 9, 1984" (the "take-off loans").  This resolution holds it applies to the loan amounts outstanding at the time of signing this document.
*   **Set-off Clauses in Loan Agreements:** Both the takeoff loans and operational loans contained clauses allowing PNB to set-off funds in UPSUMCO's bank accounts against UPSUMCO's indebtedness.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **UPSUMCO:** Potentially liable for the operational loans, to the extent they were not satisfied by the foreclosure sale, the condonation of takeoff loans, or set-offs.
*   **PNB:** Retains potential liability to return to UPSUMCO funds it had set-off as payment to APT for amounts unrelated to the condonation of the takeoff loan deficiency.
*   **APT:** Potentially liable to return amounts to UPSUMCO, to the extent set-offs exceeded the operational loan balance.

**Key Legal Issues and Case Law:**

*   **Interpretation of Contracts:** Central issue is whether the Deed of Assignment condoned all debts or only the take-off loans.  The resolution adopts a strict interpretation, limiting the condonation to explicitly referenced agreements. *Civil Code articles on interpretation of contracts apply.*
*   **Parol Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Sec. 9, Rules of Court):** Whether UPSUMCO can introduce extrinsic evidence to prove the condonation applied retroactively to the date of foreclosure.  The resolution argues that the original complaint indicated otherwise, and that the language of the Deed of Assignment is ambiguous enough to permit APT’s reading.
*   **Conventional Compensation vs. Legal Compensation (Civil Code Articles 1278, 1279, 1282):** Determination of whether valid assignment of a contract from one party to another is permitted. The court held the assignment of a debt does not necessarily extinguish the clauses in the original contract.
*   **Assignment of Credit (Civil Code Article 1624, 1627):** The transfer of PNB’s rights to APT included accessory rights like the right of set-off. *Civil Code articles on assignment of contracts applies.*
*   **Validity of the Deed of Assignment:** A point that Justice Carpio's dissent makes and that the court acknowledges. Was APT's waiver grossly disadvantageous to the government, violating public trust? *Proclamation No. 50 and RA 7181 are cited.*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "any deficiency amount" in the Deed of Assignment. UPSUMCO argued it implied retroactive application to the date of foreclosure, while the Court held it referred to the amount remaining as of the signing of the Deed of Assignment.
*   The lack of a specific effective date for the condonation in the Deed of Assignment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Proclamation No. 50 (creation of APT)
*   Republic Act No. 7181 (regarding APT asset disposition)
*   Civil Code (various articles on contracts, obligations, assignment of credits, and compensation/set-off)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 9 (Parol Evidence Rule)

**Potential Risks for Client:**

*   **For UPSUMCO:** The potential liability for the operational loans could be substantial, especially if interest and penalties have accrued.
*   **For PNB/APT:** Further litigation to determine the exact amounts due/owed, and the possibility of further liability if calculations reveal excess set-offs after the effective date of the condonation.

**Outcome:**

The Court **granted** the Second Motion for Reconsideration and **reinstated** the Court of Appeals decision, which ordered a remand to the RTC for an accounting to determine the outstanding balances on the operational loans and the proper application of payments.
