## Legal Document Summary: Northwest Airlines, Inc. vs. Steven P. Chiong (G.R. No. 155550)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's judgment holding Northwest Airlines liable for breach of contract of carriage.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** Chiong purchased a Northwest Airlines ticket for Manila to San Diego, scheduled to depart on April 1, 1989, for his employment as a Third Engineer.
*   **Breach:** Chiong arrived at the airport on time, processed his departure, but was denied boarding due to his name allegedly not appearing on the confirmed passenger list and the suspicious circumstance of his name being crossed out on the manifest and replaced with "W. Costine." The RTC and CA found Northwest deliberately prevented his check-in.
*   **Northwest's Defense:** Chiong was a "no-show" passenger. Later, Northwest argued Chiong actually left the country on April 17, 1989, on the same job.
*   **Evidence:** Chiong presented his ticket, passport with PCG stamps, and testimony of witnesses, including Philimare's liaison officer. Northwest presented the Flight Manifest and Passenger Name Record, which the lower courts deemed inadmissible hearsay.
*   **RTC and CA Ruling:** Found Northwest liable for breach of contract, awarding compensatory, actual, moral, and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.

**Obligations:**

*   **Northwest Airlines:** To honor the contract of carriage and transport Chiong as per the ticket.
*   **Steven Chiong:** To abide by the terms and conditions of the contract (appearing on the ticket).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Northwest Airlines:** Found liable for breach of contract of carriage. Damages awarded include:
    *   **Compensatory Damages:** US$8,447.00 (loss of income).
    *   **Actual Damages:** P15,000.00.
    *   **Moral Damages:** P200,000.00.
    *   **Exemplary/Punitive Damages:** P200,000.00 (due to malice and fraud).
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** P200,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The Flight Manifest and Passenger Name Record were deemed inadmissible hearsay. Northwest failed to present competent witnesses to authenticate these documents. This was detrimental to Northwest's defense of "no-show."
*   **Belated Defense:** Northwest's argument that Chiong left on April 17, 1989, was deemed waived because it was not raised in the Motion to Dismiss or Answer.
*   **Doctrine of *Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus*:** Northwest invoked this doctrine based on a pending criminal case for False Testimony against Chiong. The Court found the doctrine inapplicable as it is not a positive rule of law and the testimony was not inconsistent regarding the events of April 1, 1989.
*   **Award of Damages:** The substantial award of moral and exemplary damages hinges on the finding of bad faith and malice on the part of Northwest. This determination is highly fact-dependent.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Regarding witness credibility and the relationship of witnesses to a party not automatically affecting veracity.
*   **Leyson v. Lawa:** Emphasizing consideration of testimony in its entirety and limited application of the falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus doctrine.
*   **BPI Family Savings Bank v. Franco; Lopez v. Pan American World Airways; China Airlines, Ltd. v. Court of Appeals:** Defining "bad faith" in contract breaches and its relevance to moral damages.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Articles 2220 (moral damages), 2232 & 2234 (exemplary damages), 2208 (attorney's fees).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 9, Section 1 (waiver of defenses); Rule 15, Section 8 (omnibus motion); Rule 130, Section 43 (entries in the course of business); Rule 133, Section 1 (preponderance of evidence).
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Art. 180 (False Testimony).

**Summary of Arguments that Failed:**

*   No Show Argument
*   Falsus in Uno Falsus in Omnibus (Regarding pending case)
*   Hearsay

**Overall Assessment:** The ruling is heavily fact-dependent, hinging on the Court's assessment of witness credibility and the weight of evidence. The failure of Northwest to properly present its own evidence and its reliance on belated defenses significantly weakened its case. The significant award of damages further highlights the importance of carriers fulfilling their contractual obligations in good faith.
