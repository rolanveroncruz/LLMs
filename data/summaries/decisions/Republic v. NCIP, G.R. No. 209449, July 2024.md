**Case Summary: *Republic of the Philippines v. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, et al.*** (G.R. No. 209449, July 30, 2024)**

**Issue:** Whether Certificates of Ancestral Land Titles (CALTs) can be issued in favor of the heirs of Lauro Carantes for land within Baguio City under the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act (IPRA).

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court denied the Motions for Reconsideration and affirmed its previous decision. The Court held that Baguio City is generally exempted from IPRA coverage per Section 78, *except* concerning native title claims. However, the Carantes heirs failed to prove ownership through open, continuous, and actual possession of the land since time immemorial, a key requirement for establishing native title under the doctrine established in *Cari単o v. Insular Government*.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 78 of IPRA:** Exempts Baguio City from IPRA coverage except for native title claims.
*   **Native Title:** Defined in IPRA as "pre-conquest rights to lands and domains which, as far back as memory reaches, have been held under a claim of private ownership by [indigenous cultural communities/indigenous peoples], have never been public lands[,] and are thus indisputably presumed to have been held that way since before the Spanish Conquest." Requires continuous, open, and actual possession since time immemorial *up to the present*.
*   **Burden of Proof for Native Title:** Claimants must prove occupation and possession since time immemorial. Reliance on the *Cari単o* doctrine requires demonstrating such possession to create a presumption of private ownership predating the Spanish conquest.
*   **Registration Process:**  Application for title is not through the IPRA but through the usual land titling process.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Ancestral Land Claim:** The heirs of Carantes lose their claim for CALTs under IPRA due to failure to prove continuous, open, and actual possession.
*   **Conflicting Property Rights:** The presence of other entities with vested property rights (Camp John Hay, Baguio Country Club, Baguio Water District) on the claimed land undermines the Carantes heirs' claim of exclusive possession.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8371 (IPRA):** The central statute in question, specifically Section 3(l) regarding native title definition and Section 78 regarding Baguio City's exemption.
*   **Cari単o v. Insular Government, 41 Phil. 935 (1909):** Establishes the doctrine that long-standing possession creates a presumption of private ownership predating Spanish rule. However, the SC emphasizes in this resolution that *actual possession* must be proven.
*   **Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc. v. Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, 884 Phil. 564 (2020):** Clarifies native title as an exception to the Regalian Doctrine but reiterates the necessity of proving actual possession.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   While Baguio City is generally exempt from IPRA, the precise scope of the "native title" exception remains potentially ambiguous, as it opens the door to litigation requiring a high burden of proof.
*   The definition of "time immemorial" and the required degree of "open, continuous, and actual possession" are subject to interpretation and could lead to future disputes. The decision hinges on the Carantes heirs' failure to meet this burden.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   Future claimants in Baguio City asserting native title must gather compelling evidence of continuous, open, and actual possession since time immemorial, demonstrating physical occupation and use of the land, and addressing any potential competing claims.
*   Mere reliance on ancestry or historical connection is insufficient. Actual and ongoing possession is paramount, as the *Cari単o* presumption requires evidence of present enjoyment of the property.
