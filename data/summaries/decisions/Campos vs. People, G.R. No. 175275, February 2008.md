## Legal Document Summary: *Emilio Campos v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 175275

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Emilio Campos for five counts of qualified rape against his 14-year old daughter.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Qualified Rape under Art. 266-A, par. 1 in relation to Art. 266-B, 6th par. as amended by R.A. 8353. The qualifying circumstance is the victim being the accused's daughter.
*   **Factual Basis:** The accused allegedly sexually assaulted his daughter on five separate occasions. The victim testified consistently about the assaults, and medical evidence confirmed a healed hymenal laceration consistent with sexual abuse.
*   **Defense:** The accused denied the charges, presenting an alibi corroborated by witnesses, claiming to be elsewhere at the time of the incidents.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Emilio Campos):** Obligated to prove his innocence. Initially sentenced to death by the RTC. Ultimately sentenced to reclusion perpetua for each count, without parole, after the abolition of the death penalty via RA 9346.  Liable to pay damages to the victim.
*   **State:** Obligated to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Defense's Alibi:** The defense's alibi was deemed weak due to the proximity of the accused's alleged whereabouts to the crime scene, undermining the claim that it was physically impossible for him to commit the crimes.
*   **Lack of Physical Resistance:** The absence of evidence of physical resistance by the victim may raise questions but is addressed by the court's recognition that moral ascendancy and fear in incestuous rape can substitute for force.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A, par. 1 in relation to Art. 266-B, 6th par. as amended by R.A. 8353:** Defines and penalizes rape, including qualified rape (incestuous rape).
*   **R.A. 9346:** Abolishes the death penalty, replacing it with reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Prohibits parole for those sentenced to reclusion perpetua under R.A. 9346.
*   **People v. Balonzo, G.R. No. 176153, September 21, 2007:** Establishes principles in assessing rape cases, emphasizing the credibility of the complainant. Also cited re: increases to damage awards.
*   **People v. Grefaldia, G.R. No. 121637, April 30, 2003:** Reinforces the weakness of alibi as a defense and requirements for a valid alibi defense.
*   **People v. Capareda, G.R. No. 128363, May 27, 2004:** Highlights the greater weight given to the testimony of child rape victims.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Force, violence, or intimidation":**  While not explicitly proven physically, the Court found the father's moral ascendancy and the victim's fear sufficient to establish lack of consent, which has been precedented in earlier jurisprudence. This may be a contentious point for appeal or further legal challenge, particularly if the specific instances of "intimidation" are not detailed.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding the accused guilty of five counts of qualified rape and sentencing him to reclusion perpetua for each count, without parole. The court also modified the award of damages, increasing the moral damages to P75,000 per case while maintaining the civil indemnity and exemplary damages.
