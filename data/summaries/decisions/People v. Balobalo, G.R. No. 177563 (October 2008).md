**Case:** *People v. Balobalo*, G.R. No. 177563, October 10, 2008 (589 Phil. 371)

**Nature:** Appeal of conviction for rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended).

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the RTC's guilty verdict against Diosdado Balobalo for raping his 12-year-old daughter (AAA). The penalty was modified to reclusion perpetua.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Information:** Accused was charged with rape committed on or about January 16, 1997, in Calabanga, Camarines Sur, by means of force, threat, and intimidation against his daughter.
*   **Victim Testimony:** AAA testified to being awakened by her father, being instructed to move to his room, and subsequently being sexually assaulted, including penetration.
*   **Medical Evidence:** Medical certificate showed old hymenal lacerations, consistent with sexual intercourse.
*   **Defense:** Alibi.  Appellant claimed to have been elsewhere on the night in question.  Defense also insinuated that the charges were fabricated due to appellant's impending marriage to another woman.
* **Time of Crime:** The crime was allegedly committed at 1 AM which Appellant claimed to be Incredible.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Criminal liability for rape. Sentence: Reclusion perpetua (without parole), civil indemnity (P75,000), moral damages (P75,000), exemplary damages (P25,000).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Medical Examination:** Appellant argued that the medical examination, conducted over a year after the alleged rape, lacked significance. The Court found that healed lacerations do not negate the commission of rape.
*   **Inconsistent testimony during preliminary exam:** Initial testimony denied insertion but later stated the possibility of insertion.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The Court rejected the alibi due to inconsistencies in testimonies and failure to present a key witness.
*   **Alleged motive for fabrication:** The Court discounted the defense's assertion that the charges were fabricated, finding it to be a later addition.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A(1) (as amended):** Definition and penalty for rape.
*   **R.A. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
*   ***People v. Mateo***:  Established intermediate review by the Court of Appeals in cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.
*   ***People v. Brigildo***: "the mere touching of the labia or pudendum by the phallus is already enough to consummate the crime of rape.”
*   ***People v. Pandapatan***: "To sustain a conviction for rape, there must be proof of the penetration of the female organ.”
*   **Case Law on Credibility of Witnesses:**  The Court reiterated that the trial court's assessment of witness credibility is given great weight due to its opportunity to observe demeanor.

**Conclusion:** The Court affirmed the conviction based on the victim's credible testimony and medical evidence, despite the defense's arguments regarding the delay in the examination, inconsistencies, alibi, and alleged motive for fabrication.
