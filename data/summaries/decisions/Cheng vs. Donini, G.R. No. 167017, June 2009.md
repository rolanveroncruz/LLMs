## Legal Document Summary: Cheng vs. Donini, G.R. No. 167017

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court regarding an oral lease agreement dispute.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Oral Lease Agreement:** The case revolves around a disputed oral lease agreement between Cheng (lessor) and the Doninis (lessees) for property intended for a restaurant.
*   **Interim Grant of Authority:** Cheng granted the Doninis an "Interim Grant of Authority" allowing them to make improvements before the final lease agreement was executed.
*   **Rental & Deposit Disputes:** The parties disagreed on the terms of the lease, specifically regarding payment of deposit and rentals, preventing the finalization of a written lease agreement.
*   **Improvements:** The Doninis made improvements to the property based on the "Interim Grant of Authority." The core issue is reimbursement for these improvements.
*   **Article 1678 of the Civil Code:** This article governs reimbursement of useful improvements and ornamental expenses after the lease is terminated. Lessor has the option to pay for 50% of the value of useful improvements or allow the lessee to remove them. Lessees are not entitled to reimbursement for ornamental expenses but may remove them.

**Liabilities & Remedies:**

*   **Lessor (Cheng):**
    *   Initially, the RTC ruled in Cheng's favor, awarding damages against the Doninis.
    *   The CA reversed, ordering Cheng to reimburse the Doninis for the total cost of improvements.
    *   The Supreme Court modified the CA decision, ordering Cheng to pay the Doninis P171,650.95 as indemnity for the useful improvements, calculated by taking 50% of the value of the useful improvements (P513,301.90) and subtracting the unpaid rentals (P85,000).
    *   Ordered to pay P100,000 as moral damages, P50,000 as exemplary damages, and P25,000 for attorney's fees.
*   **Lessees (Doninis):**
    *   Initially, the Doninis sought specific performance and damages, but the RTC dismissed their complaint.
    *   Ordered to pay P100,000 as moral damages, P50,000 as exemplary damages, and P25,000 for attorney's fees.
    *   Cannot be considered possessors or builders in good faith, meaning that Articles 448 and 546 of the Civil Code did not apply.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Written Lease Agreement:**  The absence of a finalized written lease agreement is the root cause of the dispute and creates ambiguity regarding the parties' specific obligations.
*   **Classification of Improvements:**  Determining which improvements are "useful" versus "ornamental" is crucial, as only "useful" improvements are subject to potential reimbursement under Article 1678.  The CA incorrectly lumped all expenses together initially.
*   **Lessees' Abandonment:** The abandonment of the property and the reported move to Europe by the Lessees complicated the possibility of removal of improvements.
*   **Applicability of Equity:** The CA's initial reliance on equity was incorrect, as positive law (Article 1678) governs the situation. The Supreme Court only invoked equity as a secondary consideration due to the infeasibility of removing improvements.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1678:** Governs the rights and obligations regarding improvements made by a lessee on leased property.
*   **Civil Code Articles 448 & 546:**  Cited by the Lessees in the Court of Appeals, but deemed inapplicable by the Supreme Court as the Lessees could not be considered possessors or builders in good faith.
*   **Lopez v. Philippine & Eastern Trading Co., Inc., 98 Phil. 348 (1956):**  Established that a lessee is not a builder or possessor in good faith.
*   **Cortez v. Manimbo, 113 Phil. 363 (1961):** Explained that enforcing reimbursement for improvements made by tenants would put the landlord in jeopardy of improving his property out of his control.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the importance of formalizing lease agreements in writing to avoid disputes over terms and conditions, particularly regarding improvements. It also clarifies the application of Article 1678 of the Civil Code and reinforces the principle that a lessee is not a possessor in good faith, limiting their rights to reimbursement.
