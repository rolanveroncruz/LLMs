**A.M. No. MTJ-08-1712 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 08-2020-MTJ)**

**Case Summary:** This is an administrative case against Judge Rixon M. Garong, MTC, San Leonardo, Nueva Ecija, arising from his use of official court stationery and his title ("Judge") in a letter to a church in the USA regarding a church incorporation dispute. The complainant, Conrado Ladignon, alleged improper conduct.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Canon 4, Section 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:** "Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities."
*   **Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Impliedly addresses use of the prestige of judicial office. *Rosauro v. Kallos, A.M. No. RTJ-03-1796:* Specifically mentions using sala's stationery for non-official purposes as a violation. Obligation not to use official stationery for private transactions, especially with parties potentially involved in legal disputes. Obligation not to use the prestige of judicial office to advance personal or private interests.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   The Supreme Court found Judge Garong liable under Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Ethics and Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, not for the *per se* use of the letterhead, but for creating the *appearance* of impropriety. The court found he was "not very careful and discerning in considering the circumstances surrounding the use of his letterhead and his title."
*   Sanction: Admonition and warning due to it being his first offense and lack of bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Appearance of Impropriety":** The standard is inherently subjective. While *Rosauro v. Kallos* provides precedent, the court's differentiation suggests that the use of letterhead is not a *per se* violation, making future interpretations fact-dependent and potentially unpredictable. The "thin line" between proper and improper conduct requires judicial officers to carefully consider the context.
*   **Use of "Judge" Title:** The ruling clarifies that while using the title is acceptable for social identification, it is prohibited if intended to leverage the prestige of the office for personal gain or influence. This determination requires assessing the judge's intent, which can be difficult to ascertain.
*   **The decision highlights the importance of appearances and perception.**

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Rosauro v. Kallos, A.M. No. RTJ-03-1796:** Provides a clear example of prohibited conduct (using stationery for a private transaction with parties involved in a case before the judge). Serves as a key precedent but is distinguished by the court's finding that the violation is not *per se*.
*   **Dionisio v. Esca√±o, A.M. No. RTJ-98-1400:** reiterates that a judge, "... must not only be pure and faithful but must be above suspicion."
*   The ruling clarifies, that use of title and letterhead *can* be proper as social identification or return address but *is* improper when it creates the appearance that the judge is endorsing a private matter or seeking undue advantage of the prestige of judicial office.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 4, Section 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct**
*   **Canon 2, Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct**

**Legal Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case establishes that use of official court stationery and the title "Judge" are not *per se* violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, but their use must be evaluated in the context of the circumstances to determine if they create the "appearance of impropriety" or leverage the prestige of the office.  The key takeaway is that a judge should be extremely cautious when using official letterhead or titles in private communications, especially when dealing with matters that could be construed as legal disputes or where the judge's involvement could be perceived as giving one party an unfair advantage. We must advise judicial clients to avoid any actions that could reasonably lead others to believe they are using their position for personal gain or to influence others.
