## Legal Document Summary: People v. Zulueta, Sr. (G.R. No. 177297)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Claudio Zulueta, Sr. for three counts of rape (Article 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended) against his daughter, AAA. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately dismissed the appeal, affirming the CA's decision of conviction and imprisonment of Reclusion Perpetua on each count of rape with modification on damages to PhP 25,000.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Zulueta was charged with three counts of rape against his daughter, AAA, committed through force, violence, and intimidation. The informations alleged abuse of confidence and evident premeditation as aggravating circumstances, but did not allege minority of the victim.
*   **Defense:** Zulueta presented an alibi, claiming he was repairing his kitchen with his brother's assistance during the alleged dates, and that AAA was with other family members at their farm, implying that he could not have committed the crime.
*   **Credibility of Victim:** The defense challenged AAA's credibility, focusing on her initial failure to report the first incident and her remaining with the accused.
*   **Penalty:** The RTC originally sentenced Zulueta to death for each count. The CA reduced it to *reclusion perpetua* due to the failure to allege and prove the qualifying circumstance of minority in the informations. The SC affirmed the CA's decision with modification of exemplary damages.
*   **Damages:** The CA decision awarded civil indemnity and moral and exemplary damages. The SC increased exemplary damages from PhP20,000 to PhP25,000, aligned with jurisprudence.

**Obligations:**

*   Zulueta is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   Zulueta is obligated to pay civil indemnity and moral and exemplary damages to AAA.

**Liabilities:**

*   Zulueta is criminally liable for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.
*   Zulueta is civilly liable for the damages awarded to AAA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While the factual findings are unlikely to be overturned at this stage, the defense could potentially argue for a reduced sentence based on the technicality that the *informations* did not specifically allege the victim's minority at the time of the crimes.
*   The defense could raise concerns about the reliability of evidence, but the SC is not likely to overturned credibility findings by trial courts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Failure to Allege Minority:** The CA noted that the informations did not allege AAA's minority, which prevented the application of the death penalty. This could have been considered a qualifying circumstance under Article 335 and therefore increased the penalty.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** The allegations in the information are considered contentious because they are not properly proven by the prosecution.
