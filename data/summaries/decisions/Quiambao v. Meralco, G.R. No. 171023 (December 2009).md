**Legal Document Summary: *Quiambao v. Manila Electric Company (MERALCO)*, G.R. No. 171023, December 18, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the NLRC's decision awarding separation pay to a dismissed employee.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employee Dismissal:** Arsenio Quiambao (Petitioner), a branch teller for MERALCO (Respondent), was dismissed for excessive unauthorized absences, constituting abandonment of work and gross/habitual neglect of duty under the Company Code and Article 282 of the Labor Code.
*   **Prior Infractions:** Petitioner had a history of disciplinary actions, including suspensions and reprimands, for excessive absences and tardiness, indicating a pattern of misconduct.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Initially affirmed the legality of the dismissal but awarded separation pay, citing *Philippine Geothermal, Inc. v. NLRC*.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the NLRC's award of separation pay, concluding the dismissal was justified and the employee's conduct amounted to "serious misconduct."

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (MERALCO):** Obligations related to just cause and due process in employee termination, although legality of dismissal was not the core issue.
*   **Employee (Quiambao):** Obligation to adhere to company rules and regulations, including attendance policies. Liability for dismissal due to violations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal of precedent on separation pay:** The case questions when separation pay is appropriate given the ruling in Philippine Geothermal.
*   **Employee Relations:** This case highlights the importance of applying employee discipline fairly and consistently to avoid possible backlash.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282 of the Labor Code:** Grounds for termination of employment by employer, specifically "gross and habitual neglect of duty."
*   **Philippine Geothermal, Inc. v. NLRC (G.R. No. 106370, September 8, 1994):** Cited by the NLRC to justify awarding separation pay even when dismissal is for just cause.  This case is distinguished by the Supreme Court.
*   **Central Philippines Bandag Retreaders, Inc. v. Diasnes (G.R. No. 163607, July 14, 2008):** Establishes parameters for awarding separation pay; denying separation pay for termination based on serious misconduct or willful disobedience.
*   **Gustilo v. Wyeth Philippines, Inc. (483 Phil. 69, 78 (2004)):** Cited by the Supreme Court in determining that the repeated infractions constitute as serious misconduct.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Serious Misconduct":** The core dispute revolves around whether the employee's actions constituted "serious misconduct" sufficient to preclude separation pay. There can be a fine line between neglect of duty and serious misconduct.
*   **Application of "Social Justice" in Labor Disputes:** The limits of applying social justice principles to awards of separation pay for employees terminated for cause is heavily disputed in this case.
*   **Whether the NLRC committed Grave abuse of discretion:** The Supreme Court is weighing whether the CA was correct in ruling that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with MERALCO and ruled Quiambao's dismissal was legal and separation pay was unwarranted due to his habitual unauthorized absences amounting to serious misconduct. The ruling reinforces the principle that separation pay, even when considering social justice, is not automatically granted when an employee is terminated for cause, especially if the cause involves serious misconduct. The case underscores the court's stance against rewarding employee misconduct at the expense of employer rights.
