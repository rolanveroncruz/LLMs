## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Carmen Cruz-Zamora vs. Multiwood International, Inc.* (G.R. No. 146428)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling in a collection case.

**Key Provision:**  The central issue revolves around the interpretation of a "Marketing Agreement" between the late Carmen Cruz-Zamora (Zamora) and Multiwood International, Inc. (Multiwood). Zamora claimed commissions (10%) for contracts she allegedly solicited on behalf of Multiwood. Multiwood argued the agreement only covered the sale of products, not construction contracts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Zamora (or her heirs):** Claimed entitlement to commissions (P254,089.52) based on the Marketing Agreement for contracts with Edsa Shangrila, Makati Shangrila, and Diamond Hotel, arguing these were encompassed by the agreement's language.
*   **Multiwood:** Denied liability, asserting the projects were construction contracts outside the scope of the agreement.  Also counterclaimed for unliquidated advances (P37,397.71).

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA's decision in favor of Multiwood, reversing the RTC.  The SC ruled that the Marketing Agreement's terms were clear and unambiguous, limited to the sale of products, and did not extend to construction contracts.  Zamora was ordered to pay the unliquidated advances.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity (or lack thereof) of the Marketing Agreement:** The core dispute hinges on whether the agreement’s language regarding “solicitation, finding or introduction for negotiation of buyers, dealers and customers” can be interpreted to include construction projects.  The CA and SC found no ambiguity.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:**  The RTC improperly considered Exhibits K-2 to K-7 (vouchers allegedly showing partial commission payments) because they were not formally offered as evidence. This was a key factor in the CA's reversal.
*   **"Parol Evidence Rule" Application:** The SC invoked the parol evidence rule, preventing the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the written terms of the Marketing Agreement. The SC highlights that Zamora did not raise any exceptions to the rule in the trial court proceedings.
*   **Unjust Enrichment Argument:** Petitioners argued that Multiwood would be unjustly enriched if Zamora wasn't compensated. The SC rejected this, as Zamora failed to prove by preponderant evidence a cause of action.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1370 of the Civil Code:** Directs that the literal meaning of stipulations in a contract shall control when the terms are clear.
*   **Section 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Stipulates that courts can only consider formally offered evidence.
*   **Section 9, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court (Parol Evidence Rule):** Restricts the admission of extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the terms of a written agreement, except under specific circumstances (e.g., intrinsic ambiguity).

**Concerns:** The key concern is that the court focused on the *explicit* language and interpretation of the initial agreement, not the *implied* behaviors of the parties that showed they understood the original agreement to mean that she would get a commission from her introduction of customers, regardless if products where being explicitly purchased and shipped. There should be concern for the interpretation of the facts. Also the court does note that there are some exhibits presented that contradict that there was a 10% commission agreement for work that was done outside the original agreement.
