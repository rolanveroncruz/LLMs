**Case Summary: *Montano Pico and Rosita Pico vs. Catalina Adalim-Salcedo and Urbano Salcedo*, G.R. No. 152006 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling, which declared the Salcedos as the owners of Lot No. 1188 covered by OCT No. 5930 and ordered the Picos to vacate their occupied portion.

**Key Issue:** Ownership of a portion (second lot, 1,247 sq.m.) of land (Lot No. 1188) registered in Catalina Salcedo's name (OCT No. 5930), but possessed by the Picos who claim ownership through a purchase from Vicente Diaz.

**RTC Ruling:** Declared Salcedos as owners of the entire Lot No. 1188 and ordered the Picos to vacate the portion they occupied. Also declared Picos as owners of Lot No. 1192.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, dismissing both parties' appeals, citing estoppel.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied the Picos' petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **OCT No. 5930:** Original Certificate of Title registered in Catalina Salcedo's name on January 13, 1969, covering Lot No. 1188.
*   **Possession vs. Registered Title:** Picos claimed ownership of the second lot based on a Deed of Sale in 1977. The SC held that possession, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership against a registered title, as the title serves as notice to the world (citing *Legarda v. Saleeby*).
*   **Section 55 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496):** Picos argued fraudulent registration. SC found no evidence to support the fraud claim and noted the Picos' inaction to correct the registration since 1969.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Picos:** Ordered to vacate the portion of Lot No. 1188 they are occupying.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Fraud Claim Failure:** Picos' failure to substantiate their claim of fraudulent registration is a significant risk. The court emphasized the lack of evidence and inaction since the original title was issued.
*   **Collateral Attack:** The Picos' attempt to assert their ownership over a portion of the land registered under OCT No. 5930 constitutes a collateral attack on the title, which is generally not allowed.
*   **Factual Findings Conclusive:** The SC reiterated that factual findings of the RTC, when affirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive, limiting the scope of review on certiorari to questions of law.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 496 (The Land Registration Act), Section 55:** Relates to remedies in cases of registration procured by fraud.
*   ***Legarda v. Saleeby*, 31 Phil. 590 (1915):** Principle that a registered title is notice to the world.
*   **General Principles of Torrens System:** indefeasibility and notice to the world.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Picos' claim of ownership based on prior possession and purchase, despite the prior registration of the land in Salcedo's name, is the central point of contention.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Picos face a high likelihood of failure due to the strength of the Torrens title held by the Salcedos. The lack of evidence supporting the fraud claim and the established precedent against challenging registered titles through possession make their position difficult to sustain.
