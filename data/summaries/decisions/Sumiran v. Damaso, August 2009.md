Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rodrigo Sumiran v. Spouses Generoso Damaso and Eva Damaso*, G.R. No. 162518, August 19, 2009 (613 Phil. 72)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the CA's dismissal of Sumiran's petition for certiorari, which stemmed from the RTC's denial of his appeal as untimely.

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioner's Notice of Appeal was filed within the reglementary period. Specifically, the application of the "fresh period rule" established in *Neypes v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 141524, September 14, 2005, 469 SCRA 633) to determine the appeal period.

**Facts:**

*   Sumiran filed a complaint for sum of money and damages (Civil Case No. 93-2588) against the Damasos, consolidated with criminal cases for BP 22 violations.
*   The RTC acquitted Generoso Damaso in the criminal cases and ruled against Sumiran in the civil case, ordering him to pay damages to the Damasos.
*   Sumiran filed a Motion for Reconsideration, then a Notice of Appeal. The RTC denied due course to the Notice of Appeal, deeming it filed out of time, based on their records reflecting service of the RTC decision on petitioner's counsel during promulgation.
*   The CA upheld the RTC, finding Sumiran bound by his "judicial admission" of receiving the decision earlier.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *GRANTS* the petition, *REVERSES* the CA decision, and *DIRECTS* the RTC to give due course to Sumiran's Notice of Appeal.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Application of *Neypes v. Court of Appeals* ("Fresh Period Rule"):** The Court retroactively applies the "fresh period rule." This rule grants a party a fresh period of 15 days from receipt of the order denying a motion for reconsideration within which to file a notice of appeal, regardless of when the original judgment was received.
*   **Retroactivity of Procedural Rules:** Procedural laws, like the "fresh period rule," are generally given retroactive effect to pending actions.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** Because Sumiran filed his Notice of Appeal within 15 days of receiving the order denying his motion for reconsideration, his appeal was timely.

**Key Provisions/Rules:**

*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Rule 41, Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court (Appeal from RTC)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law)
*   *Neypes v. Court of Appeals* (Fresh Period Rule)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   While the *Neypes* doctrine is clear, disputes about the actual date of receipt of the order denying the motion for reconsideration could still arise.

**For the Lawyer:**

This case provides strong precedent for arguing that a Notice of Appeal filed within 15 days of the denial of a Motion for Reconsideration is timely, even if the original appeal period from the judgment itself has expired. Emphasize the retroactive application of the *Neypes* doctrine and the lack of vested rights in procedural rules. Review the factual record, however, to confirm that the appeal was indeed filed within 15 days of receiving the denial of the motion for reconsideration.
