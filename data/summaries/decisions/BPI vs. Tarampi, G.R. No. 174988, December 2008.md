Here's a legal summary of the *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Tarampi* case, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Homobono and Luzdeldia Tarampi*, G.R. No. 174988, December 10, 2008.

**Facts:** Spouses Tarampi (Respondents) obtained loans from BPI (Petitioner), secured by real estate mortgages. Respondents defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure and BPI acquiring the property at auction. After the redemption period expired, BPI consolidated ownership and obtained a new TCT. BPI then filed an *ex parte* Petition for Writ of Possession. Respondents opposed based on a pending action for annulment of the mortgages. The RTC initially suspended the writ implementation but later recalled that order. The RTC then ordered consolidation of the Opposition with the Annulment case.

**Issue:** (1) Did the RTC (Branch 220) err in giving due course to Respondents' Notice of Appeal from the RTC Branch 105's Order granting the implementation of the Writ of Possession? (2) Should the Writ of Possession be implemented during the pendency of the annulment of mortgages case?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *partially granted* the petition, directing the RTC (Branch 105) to *immediately implement* the Writ of Possession.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Section 7 mandates the bond requirement before possession; Section 8 allows the debtor to petition to set aside the sale and cancel the writ, but the order of possession remains effective during the appeal; prescribes summary procedure.
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Section 14 provides for the right to appeal the order of the Court of Land Registration

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents (Tarampis):**  Face immediate eviction due to implementation of the Writ of Possession.  Their sole recourse is the pending annulment case (Civil Case No. Q-00-41440).
*   **Petitioner (BPI):**  Risks potential damages if the annulment case is ultimately decided in favor of Respondents, potentially leading to a reversal of the foreclosure. However, currently, the law favors their right to possession.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Sections 7 & 8:** Central to the case, governing extrajudicial foreclosure and the right to a writ of possession. The summary nature of the procedure is emphasized.
*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act), Section 14:**  The legal basis for the Court resolving the issue on whether the order in granting the motion for implementation of the writ of possession is appealable.
*   **Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Tan:**  This case affirms that an order granting a writ of possession is final and appealable, not subject to certiorari.
*   **Idolor v. Court of Appeals:**  Cited by the Court of Appeals, holding that questions regarding the validity of the mortgage are not legal grounds for refusing to issue a writ of possession after consolidation of title.
*   **Sueno v. Land Bank of the Philippines:**  Confirms the ministerial duty of the court to issue a writ of possession after consolidation of title, highlighting the purchaser's absolute right to possession.
*   **Fernandez v. Sps. Espinoza:** States that Branch 105 need not look into the validity of the mortgages or the manner of their foreclosure.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The main contentious issue is whether the pendency of the action to annul the real estate mortgages is a valid defense to the issuance of the writ of possession. The Court clearly answered in the negative.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court reaffirms the well-established principle that the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of a purchaser at a foreclosure sale is a ministerial duty once ownership has been consolidated. The pendency of an action for annulment of mortgage *does not stay* the implementation of the writ.  The remedy of the mortgagor lies in the annulment case itself, and any success there would potentially lead to a separate action for damages or recovery of the property. The court ruled that the order granting the motion for immediate implementation of the writ of possession is final and appealable. The emphasis on the summary nature of the proceedings under Act No. 3135 is crucial.

**Potential for Litigation:**

The Respondents still have the annulment case (Civil Case No. Q-00-41440) pending, which remains the crucial avenue for challenging the validity of the mortgage and potentially recovering the property or seeking damages. A loss in that case effectively ends their legal options.
