**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Islands Corporation for Tourism Development, Inc. vs. Victorias Milling Company, Inc.* (G.R. No. 167674)**

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) denial of PICTD's motion to lift the suspension of proceedings in a collection suit (Civil Case No. 97-483) PICTD filed against VMC.  The SEC had ordered a suspension of all actions against VMC after VMC filed a petition to declare itself in a state of suspension of payments under PD 902-A. PICTD's claim arises from assigned loans.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Suspension Order (SEC Order dated July 8, 1997):** This order, issued by the SEC, suspends all actions and claims against VMC. The core issue is whether PICTD's collection suit should be excluded from this suspension.
*   **PD 902-A, Section 6(c) (as amended by PD 1799):** Grants the SEC power to appoint a management committee or rehabilitation receiver and, upon such appointment, suspends all actions for claims against the corporation.
*   **Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery, Section 4-10:** Allows the SEC, on motion or *motu proprio*, to terminate, modify, or set conditions for the continuance of a suspension order, or relieve a claim from coverage.
*   **Forum Shopping:** VMC alleges PICTD is forum shopping due to a related case, CA-G.R. SP No. 61267, which addressed a similar issue.  The Supreme Court found no forum shopping.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **VMC:** Subject to the SEC's rehabilitation proceedings, including the suspension of actions against it.
*   **PICTD:** Bound by the SEC's suspension order unless it can demonstrate grounds for relief under Section 4-10 of the Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery. The court emphasized compliance.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Secured Creditor":** The court highlights that P.D. No. 902-A, unlike insolvency law, does not explicitly exempt secured creditors from the suspension order. The document does not specify whether the debt assigned to PICTD is considered a secured debt in this situation.
*   **SEC's Discretion under Section 4-10:** While the SEC *may* lift the suspension, the court emphasizes that the determination of such issue is an administrative finding that this Court will not disturb absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the SEC. This leaves PICTD with limited recourse on appeal.
*   **Adequacy of Protection:** Section 4-10 allows the SEC to lift the stay if the creditor does not have adequate protection. The criteria for "adequate protection" are outlined in this section. The document does not assess whether PICTD meets these criteria.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 902-A, Section 6(c) (as amended by PD 1799):** The foundation of the SEC's power to suspend actions against corporations under rehabilitation.
*   **Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery, Section 4-10:** The provision that gives the SEC discretion to lift the suspension order.
*   ***Sobrejuanite v. ASB Development Corporation***: Cited for the purpose of suspension is to prevent a creditor from obtaining an advantage or preference over another.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Applicability of Suspension to PICTD's Claim:** The central contention is whether PICTD's claim should be excluded from the general suspension order.  PICTD argues it should be treated differently, but the SEC and the courts disagree, citing the broad language of PD 902-A. The court emphasized compliance.
*   **SEC's Discretion vs. Mandatory Relief:** PICTD seems to argue the SEC *should* have lifted the stay, while the courts emphasize the SEC's discretionary power, making relief uncertain.
* The courts highlight that P.D. No. 902-A, unlike insolvency law, does not explicitly exempt secured creditors from the suspension order. The document does not specify whether the debt assigned to PICTD is considered a secured debt in this situation.
