**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Cresencio Tabugoca*, G.R. No. 125334, January 28, 1998 (349 Phil. 236)

**Summary:**

This is an automatic review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Cresencio Tabugoca guilty of two counts of rape against his daughters, Jacqueline and Jinky. The RTC sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* for the rape of Jacqueline (Criminal Case No. 2386) and the death penalty for the rape of Jinky (Criminal Case No. 2387). The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision with modifications to the civil liabilities.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crimes:** Two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended.  Specifically, charges were made under Republic Act 7659 after December 31, 1993.
*   **Victims:** Jacqueline Tabugoca (12 years old at the time of the first incident in 1992) and Jinky Tabugoca (12 years old at the time of the second incident in 1994).
*   **Evidence:** The RTC relied on the testimonies of both victims, medical reports, and the testimony of the examining physician (Dr. Maryann M. Fontanares).
*   **Defense:** The accused raised the defense of intoxication, claiming he was unaware of his actions.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the RTC's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense of intoxication was rejected as unproven and self-serving. The Court emphasized the moral ascendancy of a father over his daughter, which can substitute for force and intimidation in incestuous rape cases.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Relationship (father-daughter) and habitual intoxication. The Supreme Court clarified relationship cannot be used twice as an aggravating circumstances since it is an element of the crime.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   Criminal Case No. 2386 (Jacqueline): Affirmed *reclusion perpetua*.
    *   Criminal Case No. 2387 (Jinky): Affirmed death penalty (subject to Presidential clemency due to the nature of the penalty at that time).
*   **Civil Liabilities:**
    *   Jacqueline: Affirmed P50,000 indemnity, plus awarded additional P25,000 as moral damages and P25,000 as exemplary damages.
    *   Jinky: Affirmed P50,000 indemnity. Awarded exemplary damages due to the presence of an aggravating circumstance.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Supreme Court confirmed jurisdiction lies with Regional Trial Court according to Judiciary Law (Section 20, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Death Penalty:** While affirmed, the death penalty was subject to possible presidential pardon. This is a critical element to consider in the context of its historical application.
*   **Intoxication as an Aggravating Circumstance:** The finding of habitual intoxication is based on inference and admission, which could be subject to debate regarding the level of proof required for such a determination.
*   **Moral Damages for Jinky:** The Court states, "no moral damages may be awarded to her because no sufficient evidence was introduced in the court a quo which would have entitled her thereto." This could be contested based on the nature of the crime and the inherent emotional distress caused.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Supreme Court did not give any regard to mitigating circumstances and ruled in favor of an aggravating circumstance.

**Actionable Items:**

*   **Review of Presidential Clemency (Criminal Case No. 2387):** If applicable, verify the outcome of the clemency process concerning the death penalty.
*   **Civil Liability Enforcement:** Ensure enforcement of the monetary awards for both victims, paying particular attention to the additional moral and exemplary damages awarded to Jacqueline.
*   **Impact of Repeal of Death Penalty (if applicable):** Consider how subsequent legal changes regarding capital punishment may affect the final outcome.
