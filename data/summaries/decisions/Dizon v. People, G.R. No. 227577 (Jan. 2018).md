## Legal Document Summary: Dizon v. People, G.R. No. 227577

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's denial of petitioner's Motion to Endorse the case to the Sandiganbayan after being convicted by the RTC for Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents. The Supreme Court granted the petition, holding that the CA erred in dismissing the Motion to Endorse, as the Sandiganbayan has appellate jurisdiction given the petitioner's low-ranking public officer status (salary grade below 27) at the time of the alleged crime.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Six counts of Malversation of Public Funds through Falsification of Public Documents (Article 217, RPC). Specifically, forging official receipts to misappropriate funds from the City Government of Manila related to parking fees.
*   **Petitioner's Role:** Clerk II and Special Collecting Officer for the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau, responsible for collecting and remitting parking fees.
*   **Jurisdiction:**
    *   Originally filed with RTC due to the petitioner's salary grade.
    *   Appellate jurisdiction belongs to Sandiganbayan per RA 8249 Section 4(c), before amendment by RA 10660.
*   **Evidentiary Matters:** The prosecution presented photocopies of the falsified official receipts and handwriting analysis linking the petitioner to the forgeries. The defense argued lack of proper documentation (billing statements) and questioned the handwriting expert's testimony, citing inconsistencies in her report which stated that "no conclusive opinion can be rendered" due to the submitted documents being mere photocopies.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner had the obligation to accurately collect, remit, and account for parking fees collected from various establishments.
*   The RTC had the obligation to transmit the appeal to the proper court (Sandiganbayan).

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC found the petitioner liable for six counts of Malversation of Public Funds Through Falsification of Public Documents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidentiary Weaknesses:** The prosecution's reliance on photocopies of the forged receipts raises questions about the admissibility and reliability of the evidence. The court itself cites inconsistent testimonies from the prosecutionâ€™s handwriting expert.
*   **Proper Penalties:** The court points out the importance of a proper application of the penalties by the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Due Process:** The Supreme Court is concerned that the RTC's incorrect transmission of the case to the CA prejudiced the petitioner's right to a proper appeal.
*   **Falsification Proof:** Reliance on handwriting analysis alone might be insufficient to prove falsification.
*   **Third party involvement:** Defense argued that others could have falsified receipts, raising doubt on sole accountability.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Malversation of Public Funds.
*   **Republic Act No. 8249, Section 4(c):** Defines the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan prior to its amendment by RA 10660. This section grants appellate jurisdiction to the Sandiganbayan over cases from the RTC where none of the accused are occupying positions corresponding to salary grade '27' or higher.
*   **Ulep v. People, 597 Phil. 580 (2009):** Establishes that the trial court has the duty to forward the records of a case to the proper appellate court, emphasizing prejudice to the accused when the wrong court is designated by the RTC.
*   **Quileste v. People, 599 Phil. 117 (2009)**: Confirms Sandiganbayan's appellate jurisdiction in malversation cases by low-ranking public officials.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the photocopies of the official receipts can be treated as authentic evidence to support a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.
*   The weight given to the handwriting expert's testimony, given the inconsistencies in the Questioned Document Report.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court held that the CA should have endorsed the case to the Sandiganbayan, as the petitioner's appeal falls within its appellate jurisdiction. The court remanded the case to the RTC for proper transmittal. The Supreme Court also noted that the petitioner raised substantial arguments in his appeal, including the admissibility of evidence and the weight of the handwriting expert's testimony, warranting a thorough review by the Sandiganbayan. This indicates the possibility of a reversal or modification of the RTC's conviction on appeal.
