**Case:** *Bohol Wisdom School vs. Miraflor Mabao* (G.R. No. 252124, July 23, 2024)

**Summary:** This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision finding Bohol Wisdom School (BWS) liable for the illegal suspension of Miraflor Mabao, a teacher, based on premarital relations and subsequent pregnancy. While the CA reversed the Labor Arbiter's (LA) finding of constructive dismissal (upheld by SC), it ruled the suspension was illegal due to violation of substantive and procedural due process. The Supreme Court affirmed with modification that the CA erred in ruling that Mabao’s employment ended on November 25, 2016 as it ended on November 9, 2016, when Mabao replied to the First Return-to-Work Notice, expressing her intention to no longer report back to the school.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Suspension:** BWS suspended Mabao for premarital relations/pregnancy, citing immorality.
*   **Immorality Standard:** The Court reiterated that the standard of immorality is public and secular, not religious, and consensual premarital sex between adults with no impediments to marry is not per se immoral under prevailing societal norms. The Court cited *Leus v. St. Scholastica's College Westgrove*, 752 Phil. 186 (2015) and *Inocente v. St. Vincent Foundation for Children and Aging, Inc.*, 788 Phil. 62 (2016)
*   **Due Process Violation:** BWS failed to issue an initial notice to explain before the suspension, violating procedural due process rights. The meeting on September 21, 2016, pre-determined her sanction as she was suspended starting September 22, 2016 (the following day) until she is legally married to her partner before hearing her side.
*   **Abandonment:** Mabao was sent letters to return to work however, the Court held Mabao abandoned her employment on November 9, 2016, when Mabao replied to the First Return-to-Work Notice, expressing her intention to no longer report back to the school citing strained relations. Prior to this Mabao filed a complaint with NLRC.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   BWS is obligated to pay Mabao backwages, 13th month pay, and other benefits until the date of her abandonment (November 9, 2016) – a modification from the CA’s November 25, 2016 date.
*   BWS is liable for attorney's fees due to Mabao being compelled to litigate.
*   BWS must issue a certificate of employment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Management Prerogative vs. Discrimination:** BWS asserted its management prerogative to uphold its standards of morality. The Court rejected this, finding it violated labor laws and Mabao’s rights as outlined in *Republic Act No. 9710* – The Magna Carta for Women.
*   **Abandonment vs. Constructive Dismissal (Disputed):** While the Court agreed that Mabao had not been constructively dismissed, the fact that a lower court (LA) found constructive dismissal is a contentious issue.
*   **Interest:** All monetary awards shall earn legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full satisfaction thereof.
*   **Individual Liability:** Dr. Simplicio Yap, Jr., and Raul H. Deloso are held jointly and solidarily liable with BWS.
