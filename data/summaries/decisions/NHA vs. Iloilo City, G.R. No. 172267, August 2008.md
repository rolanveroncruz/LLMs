## Legal Document Summary: NHA vs. Iloilo City (G.R. No. 172267)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the National Housing Authority (NHA), a tax-exempt entity, is **not required to deposit the amount of the tax sale plus interest** as a jurisdictional prerequisite under Section 267 of R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code) to maintain an action assailing the validity of a tax sale of its property.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 267, R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** This section mandates a deposit equivalent to the sale price plus 2% monthly interest before a court can entertain an action challenging a tax sale. The SC clarifies that the **deposit is a condition precedent (jurisdictional requirement)** for the court to take cognizance of the action.
*   **Tax-Exempt Status of NHA:** The NHA is recognized as a tax-exempt entity under various statutes (P.D. No. 1922, P.D. No. 2013 and R.A. No. 7279). The ruling hinges on this tax-exempt status, as the rationale for the deposit is to secure the tax delinquency, which is non-existent in NHA's case.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Iloilo City's Liability:** The ruling implies potential liability for Iloilo City for conducting the tax sale without proper basis, given NHA's tax-exempt status. This may give rise to a separate case.
*   **Purchaser's Risk (Rosalina Francisco):** Rosalina Francisco, who repurchased the property, faces the risk of losing the property and potentially seeking recourse against Iloilo City for breach of warranty or misrepresentation.
*   **Remand to Trial Court:** The case is remanded to the Regional Trial Court. Iloilo City must now answer the complaint and defend the validity of the tax sale.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Section 267:** The central statutory provision under scrutiny.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1922, P.D. No. 2013 and Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7279:** These laws establish NHA's tax-exempt status.
*   **Sps. Badillo v. Hon. Tayag, 448 Phil. 606 (2003):**  Cited to support the principle that the government, and its agencies are presumed to be solvent.
*   **City of Caloocan v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 145004, May 3, 2006, 489 SCRA 45, 55:** Cited on the definition of forum-shopping
*   **Barranco v. Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems, G.R. No. 168990, 16 June 2006, 491 SCRA 222, 230:** Cited on the requisites of Res Judicata

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Definition of "Taxpayer" under Section 267:** The court interprets "taxpayer" in the context of the deposit requirement to exclude tax-exempt entities like NHA. However, the language itself doesn't explicitly exclude such entities, potentially creating future disputes.
*   **Alleged Irregularities in the Tax Sale:** NHA alleged lack of notice and other irregularities. While the court based its decision on the tax-exempt status, these irregularities might be revisited by the trial court on remand.

**Forum Shopping & Res Judicata** The SC ruled that Forum Shopping and Res Judicata does not apply in the case.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision rests heavily on NHA's tax-exempt status. This decision provides a limited exception to the deposit requirement under Section 267, but the trial court must still determine the validity of the auction sale based on other potential procedural defects. Iloilo City needs to prepare a strong defense based on facts and applicable laws during the remand proceedings.
