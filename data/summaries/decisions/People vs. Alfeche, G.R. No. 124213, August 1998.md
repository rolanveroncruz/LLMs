## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Alfeche*, G.R. No. 124213 (1998)

**Type:** Decision on Automatic Appeal (Death Penalty)

**Subject Matter:** Rape (2 counts), Art. 335 RPC as amended by RA 7659.

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant Dante Alfeche was convicted of two counts of rape. The alleged victim, Analiza Duroja, claimed she was raped on September 11 and 18, 1994. The September 11 incident occurred while Analiza was watching TV alone in her employer’s residence. She alleges Alfeche and accomplices gagged and boxed her, causing unconsciousness, after which she awoke to signs of rape. The September 18 incident involved a similar intrusion, where Alfeche raped her while accomplices held her down and inflicted a nail wound on her hand.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the conviction for the first rape (Sept 11) due to insufficient proof, specifically Analiza's unconsciousness broke the chain of events required to infer the occurrence of the offense. The Court affirmed the conviction for the second rape (Sept 18), modifying only the penalties.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 335 RPC (as amended):** Defines and penalizes rape. Critical points:
    *   The complaint charges that the crime was committed in violation of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code rather than the amended version, Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659.
    *   While complaints did not use the language of the law "with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons" the SC ruled it sufficient for the purposes of the above-quoted third paragraph of Article 335.
    *   Prior to RA 7659 the penalty for rape when committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons was *reclusion perpetua to death*.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Dwelling present in both cases, use of a knife and multiple perpetrators in the second. Nighttime was appreciated as an aggravating circumstance in the first case but it was reversed. These are crucial as they influenced the imposition of the death penalty. The trial court found the offense was committed by three persons and with the use of a knife, and was attended with the aggravating circumstance of dwelling.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** Ordered to pay P75,000.
*   **Moral Damages:** Awarded P50,000.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded P10,000.
*   **Child Support:** Obligation to acknowledge and support the child born of the rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for rape on the second count.
*   **Civil Liability:** Monetary damages for the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Victim:**  The defense attempted to portray the victim as promiscuous. The court emphasized the lack of motive for the victim to falsely accuse the defendant.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The court rejected the alibi because the accused failed to prove it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene.
*   **Application of Aggravating Circumstances:** The Court scrutinized the application of dwelling but ultimately upheld it based on the victim's employment status at the residence.
*   **Discrepancies in Testimony:** Court found discrepancies in the testimony related to the cooking and the length of stay to be immaterial and not discredit the testimony.
*   **Failure to Report Immediately:** The court found her failure to report the rape immediately credible because of her feeling of shame.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 335 (Rape), Art. 14 (Aggravating Circumstances), Art. 47, Art. 63.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659 (RA 7659):** Amended Art. 335 RPC regarding heinous crimes.
*   **Family Code:** Art. 201.
*   **Civil Code:** Art. 2219(3), 2230, Art. 345.
*   **Constitution:** Art. III, Sec. 14(2) (regarding the death penalty).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 122, Secs. 3(e) & 10 (automatic appeal).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Consciousness during Rape:** The reversal of the first rape conviction highlights the importance of a victim's conscious testimony in establishing the elements of the crime. The court’s judgment implies a heightened burden of proof when the victim cannot directly testify to the *actus reus*.
*   **The delay in reporting.** The court acknowledged the potential influence of Philippine culture and the victim's youth on her decision to delay reporting the crime.
*   **Use of Deadly weapon.** Court acknowledged the use of a knife was a deadly weapon and therefore satisfies that element of the case.

**Conclusion:** This case reaffirms that despite inconsistencies in collateral matters, the positive testimony of a rape victim can suffice for conviction, especially when the trial court finds the testimony credible.  The decision underscores the Court's sensitivity to the cultural and psychological factors influencing a victim's behavior post-assault. However, it also emphasizes the importance of consistent and coherent evidence. The case also addresses the application of aggravating circumstances and the nuances of applying the death penalty. The case was forwarded to the Office of the President for possible pardon per R.A. 7659.
