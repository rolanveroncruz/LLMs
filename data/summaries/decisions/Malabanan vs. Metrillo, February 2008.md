## Legal Document Summary: *Malabanan v. Metrillo* (A.M. No. P-04-1875)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Ni√±o R. Metrillo, Clerk III of the Regional Trial Court, Tanauan City, Branch 83, for violation of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), later downgraded to Gross Misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Grave Misconduct:** Metrillo allegedly solicited and received P20,000 from Emiliano Malabanan, through intermediaries, promising to influence a probation officer and the presiding judge to favorably resolve a constituent's probation violation case.
*   **Representation of Influence:** Metrillo falsely represented that the probation officers were his friends and the Presiding Judge was his godfather.
*   **Resignation:** Metrillo resigned effective August 1, 2003, after the complaint was filed, attempting to evade sanctions.
*   **Dismissal of Criminal Case:** A related Estafa case filed against Metrillo based on the same facts was dismissed due to an Affidavit of Desistance from the complainant and intermediaries.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's Obligation:** Court personnel have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the judiciary and avoid actions that create the impression that decisions can be bought and sold.
*   **Liability for Misconduct:** Despite resignation and the dismissal of the Estafa case, Metrillo remains administratively liable for Gross Misconduct.
*   **Sanction:** Due to his resignation, Metrillo is fined P40,000, forfeits all retirement benefits (except earned leave credits), and is permanently barred from re-employment in any government branch or instrumentality, including GOCCs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The dismissal of the criminal Estafa case based on the Affidavit of Desistance is *not* a bar to the administrative proceedings. The Court emphasizes that the standard of proof for administrative cases is substantial evidence, lower than the proof beyond reasonable doubt required in criminal cases.
*   **Resignation as Evasion:** The court considers Metrillo's resignation *after* the filing of the complaint as an attempt to evade sanctions, further supporting the finding of guilt.
*   **Lack of Denial:** The court notes the respondent did not deny the charges, weakening his defense.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Initially charged under this statute, but the administrative charge focused on Gross Misconduct.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315, paragraph 2 (Estafa):** The criminal charge was based on this article.
*   **Civil Service Resolution No. 991936, August 31, 1999, Section 52 (A) (3):** Defines Gross Misconduct and its corresponding penalty of dismissal.
*   **Memorandum Circular No. 38, Series of 1993:**  Resignation during administrative investigation does not preclude proceedings.
*   **Numerous cases cited in *Rodriguez v. Eugenio* (A.M. No. RTJ-06-2216) and the decision itself, which establish precedent for dismissal or sanctions for court employees demanding money from litigants, including *Mendoza v. Tiongson*, *Pesole vs. Rodriguez*, *Office of the Court Administrator v. Diaz* and more.**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Areas:**

*   While the evidence supporting the Gross Misconduct is circumstantial (based on complainant's affidavit), the Court finds it sufficient, particularly given the Respondent's lack of denial. The degree of influence exerted by the Respondent is not explicitly proven, but the *appearance* of impropriety and intent to exploit his position is deemed sufficient.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of maintaining integrity within the judiciary. The court's decision emphasizes that attempts to evade administrative liability through resignation will not succeed, and that the dismissal of related criminal charges based on affidavits of desistance does not preclude administrative sanctions. The case serves as a warning to court personnel against engaging in conduct that undermines public trust and confidence in the justice system.
