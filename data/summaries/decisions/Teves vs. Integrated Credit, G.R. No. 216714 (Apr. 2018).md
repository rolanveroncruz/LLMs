## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Teves v. Integrated Credit & Corporate Services (now Aqui)*, G.R. No. 216714

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision dismissing a petition for certiorari regarding RTC orders in a writ of possession case.

**Key Issue:** Whether collection of back rentals can be awarded in an *ex parte* application for a writ of possession under Act No. 3135 and whether RTC orders compelling the payment were final orders subject to appeal.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Teves (Petitioners) mortgaged property to Standard Chartered Bank (Standard).
*   Petitioners defaulted; Standard foreclosed. Integrated Credit and Corporate Services Co. (ICCS) purchased the property at auction.
*   Petitioners failed to redeem. ICCS obtained title.
*   ICCS filed for a writ of possession. Carol Aqui (Respondent) was later substituted for ICCS as the property owner.
*   RTC granted the writ of possession to ICCS/Aqui and, crucially, also ordered Petitioners to deliver collected rentals from May 24, 2007 (expiration of redemption period) until surrender of possession.
*   Petitioners previously entered into a compromise agreement with Standard in Civil Case No. 06-227 to waive rights for deficiency.
*   CA dismissed Petitioners' certiorari petition, deeming the RTC orders final and appealable, not reviewable by certiorari.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the RTC decision in favor of ICCS/Aqui. The Court considered technicalities took a backseat against substantive rights.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Writ of Possession:** RTC properly issued the writ to ICCS/Aqui.
*   **Rental Payments:** Petitioners were obligated to remit rentals collected after the redemption period expired on May 23, 2007, as absolute ownership vested in ICCS and subsequently Aqui. The court has the ability to order to collect rents collected from tenants of the property after the owner takes absolute ownership.
*   **Duty to remit rentals to ICCS/Aqui:** Petitioners must remit rentals unlawfully collected to ICCS/Aqui.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** Petitioners are liable for rental income generated from May 24, 2007, until September 2010, to ICCS. The claim for rental income after 2010 is payable to Aqui
*   **Risk of Execution:** Failure to comply with the order to remit rentals may result in execution against Petitioners' assets.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Governs the extrajudicial foreclosure and right to writ of possession.
*   **Section 32, Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Addresses the rents and income of property pending redemption, confirming that after the redemption period belongs to the buyer.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Eliminated the distinction between a trial court acting as a land registration court with limited jurisdiction and a trial court acting as an ordinary court exercising general jurisdiction, with effectivity of decree.
*   **Section 6, Rule 135, Rules of Court** Means to carry jurisdiction into effect.
*   **IFC Service Leasing and Acceptance Corporation v. Nera**, If under Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended, the RTC has the power during the period of redemption to issue a writ of possession on the ex parte application of the purchaser, there is no reason why it should not also have the same power after the expiration of the redemption period, especially where a new title has already been issued in the name of the purchaser.
*   **China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Lozada (579 Phil. 454 (2008)):** Affirmed that the purchaser becomes the absolute owner after the redemption period, entitled to possession and rents.
*   **Powell v. Philippine National Bank, 54 Phil., 54, 63** the land bought by him and described in the deed deemed [sic] within the period allowed for that purpose, its ownership becomes consolidated in the purchaser, and the latter, "as absolute owner ... is entitled to its possession and to receive the rents and fruits thereof."

**Contentious Issues & Potential Arguments:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** Petitioners argued the compromise agreement with Standard included a waiver of deficiency claims that should bar Aquiâ€™s claim. The court correctly dismissed this, stating that the compromise agreement did not cover the rentals, and ICCS was a complete stranger.
*   **Award of Rentals in Possession Proceeding:** Argument that possession proceedings are limited in scope and cannot include ancillary matters such as back rentals. The Court affirmed the authority of the RTC under Rule 135 and equitable principles to address the unjust enrichment of Petitioners.

**Analysis and Implications:**

This case solidifies the principle that ownership rights transfer absolutely upon failure to redeem after extrajudicial foreclosure, entitling the buyer to possession and subsequent rents. It also broadens the scope of actions ancillary to the issuance of a writ of possession, enabling courts to address related issues like unjust enrichment to achieve a complete resolution. Further, the case suggests that a buyer should be added as an additional party to the proceedings to secure the rights of prior owners.
