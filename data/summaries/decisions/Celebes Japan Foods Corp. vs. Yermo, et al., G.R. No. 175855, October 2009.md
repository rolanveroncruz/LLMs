**Legal Document Summary: *Celebes Japan Foods Corporation v. Yermo, et al.* G.R. No. 175855**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision and Resolution regarding illegal dismissal and money claims.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Status:** Respondents were deemed employees of Celebes Japan Foods Corporation (Celebes), not Penta Manpower, based on labor-only contracting principles.
*   **Termination Cause:** Respondents were terminated due to cessation of operations for lack of tuna supply (authorized cause under Article 283 of the Labor Code). This finding was not contested by the respondents.
*   **Procedural Due Process Violation:** Celebes failed to provide the required one-month written notice to both the employees and DOLE prior to termination, violating Article 283 of the Labor Code.
*   **Nominal Damages:** CA awarded each respondent P50,000 in nominal damages for the procedural due process violation. Celebes sought reduction based on financial hardship.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer Liability:** Celebes, as the direct employer, is liable for the procedural violations.
*   **Payment of Nominal Damages:** Celebes is obligated to pay each respondent P50,000 in nominal damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Financial Hardship Argument:** Celebes argued for a reduction in nominal damages due to a capital deficit, relying on a financial statement. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, emphasizing the gravity of the procedural violation and the employer's unilateral action.
*   **"Dismiss Now, Pay Later" Allegation:** The case was *not* considered a "dismiss now, pay later" situation, and the CA award was nominal damages, not backwages or reinstatement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 283 of the Labor Code:** Authorized causes for termination, including the notice requirement.
*   **Agabon v. NLRC, G.R. No. 158693:** Established the principle of awarding nominal damages for procedural violations in termination cases.
*   **Jaka Food Processing Corporation v. Pacot, G.R. No. 151378:** Differentiated between dismissals for just cause (Article 282) and authorized cause (Article 283), and adjusted nominal damage amounts based on employer's initiation of dismissal. Stiffer penalty for dismissals initiated by employers exercising management prerogative.
*   **Viernes v. NLRC, G.R. No. 108405:** Distinguished; found inapplicable as it involved illegal dismissal (no authorized cause), reinstatement, and backwages.
*   **Article 2221 of the Civil Code:** Nominal damages are awarded to vindicate a violated right, not to indemnify for losses.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Amount of Nominal Damages:** Celebes contested the P50,000 amount as excessive given its financial condition. The Supreme Court upheld the CA, prioritizing the employee's right to due process.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding Celebes liable for nominal damages due to its failure to comply with the notice requirements of Article 283 of the Labor Code. The Court emphasized the importance of procedural due process and found the employer's financial hardship argument insufficient to warrant a reduction in damages, given the severity of the violation.
