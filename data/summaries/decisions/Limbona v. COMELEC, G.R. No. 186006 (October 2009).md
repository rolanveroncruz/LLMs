**Summary of *Limbona v. COMELEC & Alingan* (G.R. No. 186006)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, in relation to Rule 64, assailing COMELEC Resolutions disqualifying Petitioner from running for Mayor.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioner met the one-year residency requirement to run for Mayor of Pantar, Lanao del Norte.

**Holding:** Petition DISMISSED. COMELEC Resolutions disqualifying Petitioner AFFIRMED.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Residency Requirement:** The Court reiterated that residency for election law purposes is synonymous with domicile. Domicile requires both intent to reside in a fixed place *and* personal presence.
*   **Domicile of Origin/Choice:** The Court emphasized that a domicile, once established, continues until a new one is acquired. Changing domicile requires actual removal, *bona fide* intent to abandon the former residence, and definite acts corresponding to that purpose (animus manendi and animus non revertendi).
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Petitioner bore the burden of proving she abandoned her prior domicile. Her self-serving affidavits were insufficient to meet this burden.
*   **Family Code (Articles 68 & 69):** The COMELEC properly relied on Articles 68 and 69 of the Family Code, which obligate spouses to live together and fix a family domicile. Petitioner did not prove a separate residence from her husband.
*   **Finality of Prior Ruling (G.R. No. 181097):** The Supreme Court had already definitively ruled on Petitioner's residency in a prior case (G.R. No. 181097). That ruling is binding under the principle of *res judicata*.
* The resolution to disqualify by the second division of the comelec, and the final decision denying motion for reconsideration by Comelec en banc, has been ratified and decided already by the supreme court, therefore rendering it moot for discussion.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   Cited *Norlainie Mitmug Limbona v. Commission on Elections and Malik "Bobby" T. Alingan*, G.R. No. 181097, June 25, 2008, which directly addressed the same residency issue.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65 and Rule 64 of the Rules of Court (Certiorari).
*   Articles 68 & 69 of the Family Code (Domicile of spouses).
*   Election Law (Residency Requirements - implicitly referenced)

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Res Judicata/Law of the Case:** Petitioner is relitigating an issue already decided by the Supreme Court. Any further attempts to litigate this issue would be frivolous.
*   **Factual Determinations:** The COMELEC's factual findings regarding residency were affirmed, making it difficult for the Petitioner to challenge them.
*   **Collateral Estoppel:** The finding regarding the husband's change of domicile may have implications for other legal matters.
*   Disenfranchisement is claimed but not considered as relevant reason to overturn the binding ruling of the court of law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no clearly ambiguous clauses in this decision. The decision heavily relies on factual determinations regarding residency and the application of settled legal principles. The contentiousness arises from the Petitioner's persistent attempts to relitigate a decided issue.
* The performance of her husband's duty in Rapasun did not prevent the latter from having his domicile elsewhere. Hence, it was incorrect for the Comelec to have concluded that her husband changed his domicile only on November 11, 2006 - COMELEC findings of fact.
