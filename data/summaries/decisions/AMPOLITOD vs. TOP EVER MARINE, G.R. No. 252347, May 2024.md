Okay, here's a summary of the legal document suitable for a lawyer, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Rudy T. Ampolitod vs. Top Ever Marine Management Phils. Inc., et al.* G.R. No. 252347, May 22, 2024 (Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the NLRC's dismissal of Ampolitod's claim for total and permanent disability benefits. The Supreme Court granted the Petition.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Ampolitod was hired repeatedly as Able-Bodied Seaman by Top Ever (for TEMM Maritime) since 2009, most recently on June 27, 2015.
*   **Illness:** Diagnosed with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) after medical repatriation in October 2015. Symptoms appeared approximately 2 months after embarkation. The company-designated physician's impression was Pancytopenia Secondary to Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, compatible with MDS. Cytogenetic analysis indicated the illness was not genetic.
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** Company-designated physician initially indicated Ampolitod was fit to work after treatment ended in May 2016, but recommended continued monitoring. Ampolitod's CBC results continued to show abnormalities. A physician of his choice, Dr. Queja, declared him unfit to work. A third doctor, Dr. Escasa, confirmed MDS and recommended Ampolitod no longer work as a seafarer.
*   **LA Decision:** Initially ruled in favor of Ampolitod, awarding disability benefits based on exposure to harmful chemicals.
*   **NLRC & CA Decisions:** Reversed the LA, dismissing the complaint. They held that MDS is not a listed occupational disease and Ampolitod failed to prove a causal connection between his illness and his work.
*   **POEA-SEC:** The case revolves around the 2010 POEA-SEC, specifically Section 20(A) regarding work-related injury or illness and Section 32-A concerning occupational diseases.
*   **SC Ruling:** Granted the petition, finding that CA erred. The SC reinstated the LA decision with modification.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer Obligations (Top Ever/TEMM):** Joint and several liability to pay Ampolitod USD 60,000 in disability benefits plus USD 6,000 in attorney's fees. The SC also imposed 6% legal interest per annum from finality of the decision until full payment. The employer also has a duty to provide a safe working environment.
*   **Seafarer Obligations (Ampolitod):** Duty to report condition as per the POEA-SEC.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Work-Relatedness of MDS:** MDS is not explicitly listed as an occupational disease in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC.
*   **Causation vs. Contribution:**  The legal standard is whether the employment "contributed, even in a small degree" to the development of the disease.
*   **Finality of Medical Assessment:** The company-designated physician's assessment was not considered "final, definite, and conclusive" because further monitoring was recommended and there was no proper notice to the seafarer, as emphasized in *Gere v. Anglo-Eastern Crew Management Phils., Inc.*
*   **Disputable Presumption:**  The court reiterated *Hernandez v. Sealion Maritime Services, Corp.*, stating that the disputable presumption of work-relatedness includes a corollary disputable presumption of compensability.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2010 POEA-SEC (Sec. 20(A), 32-A):** Governing contract.
*   **Civil Code Article 2208(8):**  Basis for attorney's fees.
*   **Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue:** Establishes timelines for the company-designated physician's assessment.
*   **Gere v. Anglo-Eastern Crew Management Phils., Inc.:** Requires proper notice of the final medical assessment to the seafarer.
*   **Hernandez v. Sealion Maritime Services, Corp.:** Disputable presumption of work-relatedness should automatically include a corollary disputable presumption of compensability.
*   **Ventis Maritime Corp. v. Salenga:** Applicable rule is Section 20(A) of the POEA-SEC since his non-listed illness occurred during the term of his contract.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether Ampolitod's exposure to chemicals, specifically benzene, was sufficient to contribute to MDS, given the lack of direct medical findings linking the two.

**Overall Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and NLRC decisions, finding that the seafarer Ampolitod is entitled to disability benefits. The court emphasized that given his recurring employment the seafarer was exposed to the chemicals for an extended period contributing to his illness and that the employer did not issue a final and conclusive medical assessment, as required by law. The court also affirmed attorney's fees and imposed legal interest on the award.
