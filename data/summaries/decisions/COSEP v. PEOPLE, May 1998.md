## Legal Document Summary: *Cosep v. People of the Philippines*

**Case:** *Cosep v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 110353, May 21, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Sandiganbayan conviction for violation of Section 3(b) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Tomas H. Cosep, Municipal Planning and Development Coordination Officer of Olutanga, Zamboanga del Sur.
*   **Respondents:** People of the Philippines and Sandiganbayan.
*   **Private Complainant:** Angelino E. Alegre.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 3(b) of R.A. 3019 - demanding and receiving P500.00 from Angelino Alegre as consideration for awarding the construction of an artesian well and facilitating payment.
*   **Underlying Facts:** Cosep, as Municipal Planning Officer, oversaw the construction of an artesian well by Alegre under a "pakyaw" arrangement. After the project was finished, the allegation is Cosep secured the full contract price (P5,000.00) but only remitted P4,500.00 to Alegre, retaining P500.00 for alleged processing expenses.
*   **Cosep's Defense:** Alegre was not a contractor, but merely a laborer entitled to a daily wage. The P4,500.00 was the total salary of all workers, and Cosep did not withhold any amount. He presented a Time Book and Payroll Sheet and a Memorandum from the Mayor designating Alegre as the head laborer.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:**

*   Initially convicted Cosep. Reasoning not specified in this document.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Acquitted Cosep** due to reasonable doubt.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Credibility of Prosecution Witness (Alegre):** The Court found Alegre's testimony questionable and his claim to be a contractor unsupported. He failed to provide evidence of being a contractor, such as procurement documents, and couldn't recall names of workers despite many sharing his last name.
    *   **Documentary Evidence:** The Time and Book Payroll Sheet, signed by Alegre, indicated he was a head laborer. The Court cited *U.S. v. Carrington* (5 Phil. 725) regarding the evidentiary weight of public documents like municipal payrolls.
    *   **Estoppel:** Alegre was estopped from denying his representation in the payroll sheet as a head laborer.
    *   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Alegre was a contractor or that Cosep wrongfully withheld P500.00.
    *   **Judicial Impartiality:** Rejected the argument that the Sandiganbayan justices were partial, finding their questions were aimed at clarifying facts. Cites *People v. Opinada* (142 SCRA 259) and *Domanico v. Court of Appeals* (122 SCRA 218) regarding judicial intervention for clarification.

**Key Legal Principles & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Prohibits public officials from directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift, present, share, percentage, or benefit for themselves or for any other person, in connection with any contract or transaction between the Government and any other party.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** Constitutionally guaranteed, and the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Cites *People v. Alcantara* (240 SCRA 122) and *People v. Yabut* (210 SCRA 394).
*   **Burden of Proof in Criminal Cases:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Cites *People v. Tiwalen* (213 SCRA 701).
*   **Evidentiary Weight of Public Documents:** Public documents are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. Cites *U.S. v. Carrington* (5 Phil. 725) and Section 23, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Estoppel:** A legal principle that prevents a party from denying a previous representation.
*   **Judicial Impartiality:** Accused has a right to a fair trial before an impartial judge. Cites Section 14, Article III, 1987 Constitution and *Javier v. COMELEC* (144 SCRA 194).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The core of the case revolves around conflicting factual claims regarding Alegre's role (contractor vs. laborer) and the disposition of the P5,000.00.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Supreme Court heavily relies on assessing the credibility of the prosecution witness, which is a common point of contention in many cases.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The question of whether the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of innocence is a recurring theme in criminal appeals.
*   **Judicial Discretion:** The Supreme Court's decision to overturn the Sandiganbayan's factual findings highlights the extent of judicial discretion in reviewing lower court judgments.
*   **Lack of Documentary Support:** The lack of documentary support from Alegre weakens his claim of being a contractor.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court reversed the Sandiganbayan's conviction due to reasonable doubt, primarily based on the lack of credible evidence supporting the claim that Cosep violated Section 3(b) of R.A. 3019. The decision emphasizes the importance of the presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court also highlights the evidentiary value of public documents and the principle of estoppel. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of credible testimony and documentary support in proving criminal allegations.
