## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Udang, Sr.* (G.R. No. 210161)

**Subject:** Appeal of conviction for two counts of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code. Ultimately adjudicated as two counts of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A(1) RPC (Rape):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, intimidation, deprivation of reason, or fraudulent machination.
*   **Section 5(b) of RA 7610 (Sexual Abuse):** Punishes sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse. Consent is immaterial.
*   **Article III, Section 21, Constitution (Double Jeopardy):** Prohibits double punishment for the same offense.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant, Bienvinido Udang, Sr., was initially charged with two counts of "child abuse" (Rape in relation to Sec. 5(b) RA 7610) based on two separate incidents of sexual intercourse with the victim, AAA, who was 12 and 13 years old at the time. The prosecution argued the facts fit the charge due to intoxication of victim by the accused.
*   The RTC convicted Udang of two counts of rape, despite the information referencing RA 7610, reasoning that the charges could only amount to rape under Art 266-A(1) because charging both RAPE and SEXUAL ABUSE would violate the right against Double Jeopardy.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Udang was originally obligated to serve two terms of *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages for each count of rape.  This was based on the incorrect application of Art 266-A(1) rather than Sec. 5(b) of RA 7610.
*   The Supreme Court ultimately held Udang guilty of two (2) counts of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, and sentenced him to twelve (12) years of prision mayor as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum for each count. He also has to pay AAA P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Issues:**

*   **Procedural Question:** The trial judge who rendered the decision was not the same judge who heard the testimony. Udang argued this undermined the credibility assessment. The Court ruled this was not grounds for reversal, citing *United States v. Abreu* (30 Phil. 402 (1915)) and *People v. Court of First Instance of Quezon, Br. X* (G.R. No. L-48817, October 29, 1993).
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The RTC incorrectly believed that charging Udang with both rape and sexual abuse would violate double jeopardy. The Supreme Court clarified that rape under the Revised Penal Code and sexual abuse under RA 7610 are distinct offenses with different elements. *People v. Abay* (599 Phil. 390 (2009)) was expressly abandoned due to the SC decision in this case.
*   **Misinterpretation of Charge:** The Informations referred to "child abuse" and cited both Article 266-A and Section 5(b) of RA 7610, leading to the trial court misconstruing the charges as rape.  The Supreme Court emphasized that the factual allegations in the Information, not the statutory references, determine the crime charged, citing *Malto v. People* (560 Phil. 119 (2007)).
*   **Victim Credibility:** Udang challenged the credibility of the victim based on her return to his house after the first incident and her delay in reporting the abuse. The Court cited *People v. Bahuyan* (308 Phil. 346 (1994)) and *People v. Errojo* (299 Phil. 51, 61 (1994)) and found her testimony credible, emphasizing the child's categorical narration and Betty's threats.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 266-A (Rape).
*   **Republic Act No. 7610 (RA 7610):** Section 3 (Definition of Child Abuse), Section 5(b) (Sexual Abuse).
*   **Constitution:** Article III, Section 21 (Double Jeopardy).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (RA 4103):** For application of penalties.
*   **United States v. Abreu (30 Phil. 402 (1915))**: A presiding judge can write a decision with a trial transcript even if they did not witness the original trial.
*   **People v. Court of First Instance of Quezon, Br. X (G.R. No. L-48817, October 29, 1993)**: Jurisdiction rests with the court, not the individual judge, and so the trial judge can be replaced during the decision without it being void.
*   **Nierras v. Dacuycuy, 260 Phil. 6 (1990)**: A single criminal act may give rise to a multiplicity of offenses and therefore does not create Double Jeopardy.
*   **People v. Abay, 599 Phil. 390 (2009) (abandoned)**: The decision stated it would violate the right against double jeopardy if accused had charges for both rape and sexual abuse.
*   **Malto v. People, 560 Phil. 119 (2007)**: Explains the difference between Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610 and Rape cases, with the former not considering consent in their verdict.
*   **People v. Bahuyan, 308 Phil. 346 (1994) and People v. Errojo, 299 Phil. 51, 61 (1994)**: Delay in reporting is not an indication of a fabricated charge, since victims of rape and sexual abuse choose to suffer alone and "bear the ignominy and pain" of their experience.

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original charge of "child abuse" was ambiguous and could have been interpreted as falling under either Article 266-A or RA 7610 Section 5(b). This ambiguity led to the incorrect application by the lower courts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court corrected the misapplication of the law by the lower courts, holding Udang guilty of sexual abuse under RA 7610. The decision clarifies the distinction between rape and sexual abuse, addresses procedural issues regarding judge replacement, and provides guidance on assessing victim credibility in sexual abuse cases. The abandonment of *People v. Abay* removes a previously existing conflict in case law regarding double jeopardy in these types of cases.
