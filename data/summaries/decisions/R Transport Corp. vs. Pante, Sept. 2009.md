**Legal Document Summary: R Transport Corporation v. Eduardo Pante, G.R. No. 162104, September 15, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's ruling holding R Transport liable for damages due to a vehicular accident causing physical injuries to passenger Eduardo Pante.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Common Carrier Liability (Art. 1733, 1755, 1756, 1759, Civil Code):**  R Transport, as a common carrier, is bound to observe extraordinary diligence for the safety of its passengers. Injury to a passenger creates a presumption of fault or negligence, which the carrier must rebut by proving extraordinary diligence. The carrier is liable for the negligence of its employees, even if exercising due diligence in their selection and supervision.
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded, and the CA affirmed:
    *   Actual Damages: P39,112.60 (Hospital & Med. Expenses)
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00 (Pain, Anguish)
    *   Exemplary Damages: P50,000.00 (Reckless Driving)
    *   Attorney's Fees: 25% of total damages (Contingent Fee)

**Liabilities:**

*   R Transport Corporation is liable to Eduardo Pante for the injuries sustained as a result of the negligent driving of its employee, Johnny Merdiquia, leading to the bus accident. This liability is based on the carrier's failure to rebut the presumption of negligence and the application of Art. 1759 of the Civil Code.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process Concerns (Rejected):**  R Transport claimed denial of due process due to the trial court's waiver of its right to present evidence. This was rejected by the Supreme Court because of R Transport's repeated failure to attend hearings and delaying tactics.
*   **Evidentiary Sufficiency:**  R Transport contested the admissibility of the hospital statement of account and the lack of testimony for medical certificate. The Court upheld its admissibility by Jarco Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** R Transport argued against the award of moral and exemplary damages. The Court upheld the award of moral damages, citing Spouses Ong v. Court of Appeals and of exemplary damages due to the reckless driving of the bus driver.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1733, 1755, 1756, 1759, 2219, 2220, 2232:** Govern common carrier obligations, presumption of negligence, and the types of damages recoverable.
*   **Jarco Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals:**  Cited for the admissibility of hospital statements of account as evidence of actual damages.
*   **Spouses Ong v. Court of Appeals:** Cited for the propriety of awarding moral damages for physical injuries sustained by passengers in a vehicular accident.
*   **Mallari, Sr. v. Court of Appeals & Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Supports the liability even with proper diligence.
*   **Silverio, Sr. v. Court of Appeals:** Due process and waiver of right to present evidence.
*   **Prudencio v. Alliance Transport System:** Purpose of exemplary damages.
*   **SCC Chemicals Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Admissibility of the medical certificate for failure to object.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not explicitly ambiguous, the extent of "extraordinary diligence" required of common carriers can be fact-specific and open to interpretation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, upholding the liability of R Transport for damages arising from the bus accident. The key issue revolved around the presumption of negligence against common carriers and their failure to rebut it. The award of damages, including moral and exemplary, was justified based on the specific circumstances of the case, the reckless behavior of the driver, and the physical injuries sustained by the passenger.
