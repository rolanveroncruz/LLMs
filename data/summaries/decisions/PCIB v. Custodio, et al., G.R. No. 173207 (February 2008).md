Here's a concise legal summary of the document provided:

**Case:** *Philippine Commercial and International Bank (PCIB) v. Custodio, Gliane, and Francisco*, G.R. No. 173207, February 14, 2008.

**Summary:**

This case concerns the liability for US$42,300 remitted by Gliane (agent of Custodio) to Francisco's account at PCIB (now BDO), which PCIB then set-off against Francisco's outstanding debt under a Foreign Bills Purchase Line Agreement (FBPLA). Custodio and Gliane sued PCIB and Francisco for specific performance and damages when the funds were not delivered to the intended beneficiaries.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **FBPLA:** Agreement between PCIB and Francisco (purportedly on behalf of ROL-ED Traders Group Corporation). This granted Francisco an advance on checks/drafts without the standard clearing period, but carried obligations for returned/dishonored checks. Specifically, it contains an undertaking of the spouses that "If a check is returned/dishonored for any reason whatsoever, we shall immediately, without need of demand, pay [the bank] the amount of the check, together with the interest at the rate of ** percent (%) per annum x x x and penalty at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum, computed from the date of purchase of the check to the date of full payment. ** - prevailing market rate The amount of returned and dishonored checks, together with interest, penalty and other charges, shall be debited from any of our accounts with any of [the bank’s] branches, and if the credit balance thereof is insufficient, we undertake to pay [the bank] the deficiency immediately."
*   **Express Padala:** PCIB's dollar remittance service, implying an obligation to promptly and accurately remit funds.
*   **Set-off:** PCIB exercised its right to set-off the US$42,300 against Francisco's debt, authorized under the FBPLA's provisions.
*   **Request for Change of Beneficiary:** Gliane requested that the funds go to Cortez and/or Cruz, but this request allegedly arrived after the set-off.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Francisco:** Ultimately held solely liable by the Supreme Court.
*   **PCIB:** Initially held jointly and severally liable by the RTC, then solely liable with the right of reimbursement, but was eventually freed of any liability by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Separate Corporate Personality:** Francisco attempted to argue that the FBPLA was with ROL-ED, not him personally, despite signing on behalf of ROL-ED. This was raised late in the appellate proceedings and was initially credited by the Court of Appeals in its Amended Decision but was reversed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Timing of the Change of Beneficiary Request:** Crucial to determining whether PCIB was negligent in applying the funds to Francisco's debt. PCIB claims the request arrived after the set-off.
*   **Negligence of PCIB:** This was the initial basis for the RTC's judgment against PCIB, related to the Express Padala service. The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court found no negligence on the part of PCIB.
*   **Proof of Receipt of Funds:** Francisco argued that there was no evidence he received the benefit of the remittance. This argument was not convincing given his prior statements admitting that the remittance was used to pay for his own loan obligation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Judicial Admissions:** A party cannot take a position contrary to their pleadings. This principle undermined Francisco's arguments regarding the debt being ROL-ED's, not his.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The court acknowledged the possibility of disregarding corporate fiction to prevent injustice, reinforcing the rejection of Francisco's last-minute argument.
*   **Obligations under Contract:** A party who has not appealed cannot obtain from the appellate court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the appealed decision, but an appellee, like Francisco, can advance any argument that he may deem necessary to defeat the appellant’s claim or to uphold the decision that is being disputed.
*   **Express Padala obligations:** Gliane and Custodio failed to prove, however, that PCIB had that policy, or that the contract under the Express Padala service of PCIB provided for a three-day holding period.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of PCIB, finding that the set-off was valid, and that Francisco was responsible for the debt. This decision rested on the principle that, because Francisco had previously admitted that the remittance was applied to his loan, the claim that it was for ROL-ED was only raised on appeal, and he failed to prove the Express Padala contract included a three-day holding period.
