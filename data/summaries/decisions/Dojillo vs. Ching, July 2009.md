*   **Judge Dojillo's Complaint (P-06-2245):** Judge Dojillo accuses Clerk of Court Ching of (a) Gross Misconduct (gossiping, disrespect), (b) Gross Incompetence and Inefficiency (delegating tasks, absenteeism, refusal to use technology), (c) Violation of Smoking Ban, (d) Conduct Unbecoming a Public Official, (e) Violation of Code of Ethics (harassment of colleague), and (f) Gross Dishonesty (falsifying DTR).
*   **Clerk of Court Ching's Counter-Complaint (MTJ-09-1741):** Clerk of Court Ching accuses Judge Dojillo of immorality related to an alleged affair with a court interpreter.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator recommends that the complaint against Judge Dojillo be dismissed for lack of substantial evidence. It recommends that Clerk of Court Ching be found guilty of falsification and dishonesty and be suspended for six (6) months.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court *affirms* the OCA's recommendation. Clerk of Court Ching is found **GUILTY of dishonesty and falsification of official document** for falsely stating December 12, 2005, was a local holiday on her Daily Time Record, and is **SUSPENDED** for six months without salary and other benefits. The counter-complaint against Judge Dojillo is **DISMISSED**, but he is **ADMONISHED** to be more circumspect in his choice of words and use of gender-fair language.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Clerk of Court Ching:** Liable for dishonesty and falsification of official document; subject to six-month suspension without pay.
*   **Judge Dojillo:** No administrative liability found, but receives an admonishment for improper language.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Falsification of DTR:** *Flores v. Hon. Layosa, 479 Phil. 1020, 1038 (2004).* The court emphasizes that even a single false entry in a DTR constitutes falsification and dishonesty, potentially leading to financial losses for the government, because it enables an employee to receive salary and earn leave credits for services which were never rendered. The court acknowledges that such an act automatically results in financial losses to the government.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While dishonesty typically warrants dismissal per CSC rules, the Court considered Clerk of Court Ching's first offense and acknowledged mitigating circumstances in imposing a lesser penalty of suspension, consistent with *Re: Administrative Case for Falsification of Official Documents and Dishonesty against Randy S. Villanueva, A.M. No. 2005-24-SC, August 10, 2007, 529 SCRA 679, 687; Servino v. Adolfo, A.M. No. P-06-2204, November 30, 2006, 509 SCRA 42.* *In Re: Failure of Jose Dante E. Guerrero* is also cited as providing precedent for suspension in time record falsification cases.
*   **Gendered Language:** *Vide A.M. No. 03-05-01-SC (April 27, 2004), New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, Canon 5.* Judge Dojillo's characterization of Clerk of Court Ching's sexual orientation, in the context of the charges, was deemed inappropriate and prompted an admonishment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **De Vera v. Rimas, A.M. No. P-06-2118, June 12, 2008, 554 SCRA 253, 259.** - Reinforces the gravity of dishonesty in the judiciary.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 99-1936, Rule IV, Section 52 (A) (1) & (6).** - Defines dishonesty and falsification of official documents as offenses punishable with dismissal.
*   **Report on the Attendance in Office of Mr. Glenn B. Hufalar, MTCC, Br. 1, San Fernando City, La Union, A.M. No. 04-10-296-MTCC, July 28, 2008, 560 SCRA 14.** - Reinforces the gravity of making false entries in the DTR.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None apparent. The primary issues revolve around factual determinations (falsification) and the application of established administrative law principles.
