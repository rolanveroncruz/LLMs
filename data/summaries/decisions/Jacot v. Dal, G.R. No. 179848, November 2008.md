## Legal Document Summary: Jacot v. Dal and COMELEC

**Case:** *Jacot v. Dal and COMELEC*, G.R. No. 179848, November 27, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC's disqualification of Petitioner Jacot from running for Vice-Mayor due to failure to personally renounce his US citizenship as required by Republic Act No. 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Re-Acquisition Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **R.A. 9225, Sec. 3:** Requires natural-born Filipinos naturalized abroad to take an oath of allegiance to the Philippines to reacquire/retain citizenship.
*   **R.A. 9225, Sec. 5(2):**  Imposes an additional requirement for those *seeking elective public office* in the Philippines: a "personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath" at the time of filing the Certificate of Candidacy. This is *distinct* from the oath of allegiance.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 43, Sec. 1:** Supplementally applies the Rules of Court.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Sec. 34:** Evidence must be formally offered for consideration.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner had the obligation to prove his qualification for office, including compliance with Sec. 5(2) of R.A. 9225.
*   Petitioner had to formally offer the Affidavit of Renunciation to the COMELEC, but failed to do so.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner was held liable for failing to properly renounce his US citizenship.
*   Petitioner was held accountable for the actions/inactions of his legal counsel during the COMELEC proceedings.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Compliance:** The key issue revolves around whether the Oath of Allegiance or the Certificate of Candidacy oath satisfies the renunciation requirement under R.A. 9225, Sec. 5(2). The Court explicitly rules *against* this interpretation, establishing that a separate and express renunciation is required.
*   **Late Submission of Evidence:** The Petitioner's attempt to introduce an "Affidavit of Renunciation" executed *before* filing his Certificate of Candidacy for the first time on appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected. This highlights the risk of procedural errors in presenting evidence.
*   **Attorney Negligence Argument:** The Petitioner's argument that his attorney's alleged negligence in not presenting the "Affidavit of Renunciation" excuses his non-compliance was also rejected. This highlights the risk of relying on potentially inadequate legal advice and the binding nature of an attorney's actions on their client.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Distinguished from *Valles v. COMELEC* and *Mercado v. Manzano*:** The court distinguishes these cases, which held that filing a certificate of candidacy with an oath of allegiance was sufficient for persons with dual citizenship from birth. This case is different because Jacot affirmatively naturalized as a US citizen. Furthermore, those cases preceded the explicitly worded requirements of Section 5(2) of Republic Act No. 9225.
*   **Cited *Lopez v. COMELEC*:** Relied on this case as a more factually similar precedent, where a naturalized US citizen who reacquired Philippine citizenship failed to personally renounce their foreign citizenship as required by Sec. 5(2). This resulted in disqualification despite receiving the most votes.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9225:**  The core statute governing citizenship retention/re-acquisition and its implications for holding public office.
*   **Section 40(d) of the Local Government Code**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the COMELEC's disqualification of Petitioner. The key holding is that R.A. 9225, Sec. 5(2) mandates a **separate, personal, and sworn renunciation of foreign citizenship** *before* or *simultaneously* with the filing of the Certificate of Candidacy, and this cannot be satisfied by the oath of allegiance or the Certificate of Candidacy oath alone. The court emphasized the importance of timely and proper presentation of evidence and held the petitioner accountable for his counsel's actions. This case serves as a strict interpretation of the renunciation requirement under R.A. 9225.
