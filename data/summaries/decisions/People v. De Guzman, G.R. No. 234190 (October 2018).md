## Legal Document Summary: People v. De Guzman

**Case:** G.R. No. 234190, October 1, 2018 (840 Phil. 759)

**Nature:** Ordinary appeal of a CA decision affirming with modifications the RTC's conviction for two counts of Statutory Rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A (1) (d) RPC:** Defines Statutory Rape as carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age.
*   **Article 266-B (1) RPC:** Qualifies Statutory Rape and increases penalties when the victim is under 18 and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
*   **RA 9346, Sec. 3:** Prohibits parole for persons convicted of offenses punished with *reclusion perpetua* or whose sentences are reduced to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant Ferdinand De Guzman found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of **Qualified Statutory Rape**.
*   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, without eligibility for parole, for each count.
*   Ordered to pay the victim, AAA, **P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count,** all with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of the decision until full payment.

**Key Facts & Reasoning:**

*   **Facts:** The Accused-Appellant, Ferdinand De Guzman, was charged with two counts of statutory rape of AAA, his niece-in-law, who was 9 years old at the time of the incidents.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Ferdinand guilty based on the positive testimony of the victim, and rejected the Accused's defense of denial and alibi.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC ruling, but increased exemplary damages and imposed a legal interest of 6% per annum.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed the CA ruling with modifications. Upgraded the conviction to Qualified Statutory Rape, considering the victim's age (under 18) and her relationship with the offender (relative by affinity). Applied RA 9346, prohibiting parole. Increased the damages awarded to conform with prevailing jurisprudence (citing *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016)).  Emphasized that appeals in criminal cases open the entire case for review, citing *People v. Dahil, 750 Phil. 212, 225 (2015)*.
*   The Court emphasized the victim's credibility, citing *People v. Rayon, Sr., 702 Phil. 672, 680 (2013)*, stating that a young girl would not concoct a sordid tale of rape against her own relative unless it was true.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Absence of Force:** The prosecution must adequately prove force, threat, or intimidation to support the conviction, though given the victim's age, lack of consent is presumed.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** While the court emphasizes the victim's credibility, arguments against that could be raised.
*   **Parole Ineligibility:** The lack of eligibility for parole, even for a first-time offender, may be considered a severe penalty by some.
*   **Amount of Damages:** While aligned with existing jurisprudence, the quantum of damages may be subject to further legal challenges, although unlikely to be successful.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016) - Guides the award of damages in criminal cases.
*   People v. Dahil, 750 Phil. 212 (2015) - Discusses the scope of review in criminal appeals.
*   People v. Rayon, Sr., 702 Phil. 672 (2013) - Pertains to the credibility of a victim.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Articles 266-A and 266-B
*   Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty)

**Overall Assessment:** The case hinges on the credibility of the victim's testimony and the established relationship between the accused and the victim. The decision appears sound and well-supported by existing jurisprudence and statutory law. The imposed penalties and damages are consistent with established legal principles.
