Here's a legal summary of *G.R. No. 153923, October 02, 2009, Spouses Tomas F. Gomez and Adelaida S. Gomez vs. Gregorio Correa and Philippine Realty Corp.*:

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over a 650-square meter residential lot originally acquired by Benedicta Mangahas from Philippine Realty Corporation (PRC) via a Contract to Sell (No. 988-N). Subsequent transfers of interest created conflicts regarding ownership and reimbursement of payments made towards the property. The central issue is the enforceability of a final and executory judgment from a prior case (Civil Case No. 4120) and whether subsequent courts can modify its terms, specifically the amount to be reimbursed.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Contract to Sell No. 988-N (March 6, 1951):** Original agreement between Benedicta Mangahas and PRC. Establishes the basis of ownership and payment obligations.
*   **Deeds of Transfer and Assignment:** Multiple transfers of rights (Benedicta to Magdalena Madrid, Magdalena to Adelaida Gomez, Benedicta to Gregorio Correa) introduced complexities in determining rightful ownership and liabilities. The Deed of Assignment from Magdalena to Adelaida stipulated joint and several liability with Benedicta.
*   **Prior Case (Civil Case No. 4120):** CFI Pasig ruled on the rescission of the sale from Benedicta to Correa and ordered Correa to reimburse the Spouses Gomez P1,600.20. This judgment became final and executory.
*   **Modification of Final Judgment:** The RTC Caloocan and initially the CA modified the judgment amount to P1,060.20, leading to the Supreme Court appeal. The Supreme Court reiterates the doctrine of immutability of final judgments, citing *Mayon Estate Corporation v. Altura, G.R. No. 134462, October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 377, 386.*
*   **Award of Attorney's Fees:**  The CA awarded attorney's fees to Correa based on the Spouses Gomez's refusal to subdivide. The SC reversed this, citing *Francisco v. Co, G.R. No. 151339, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 241, 257* stating that an adverse decision does not automatically justify attorney's fees. The SC also cited Article 2208 of the Civil Code as the list of times attorney fees can be awarded.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Gregorio Correa's Obligation:** To reimburse the Spouses Gomez P1,600.20 (as per the original CFI judgment) plus legal interest.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** The appellate court's inconsistent calculation of interest rates (6% and 12%) created ambiguity. The SC ruling addresses this.
*   **Ambiguity in Deed of Assignment:** The extent of the joint and several liability assumed by Adelaida Gomez under the Deed of Assignment could have been a point of contention, but was resolved by the prior CFI case.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Doctrine of Immutability of Final Judgments:**  Central to the SC's decision.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Governing the award of attorney's fees.
*   **Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court:** (Cited by the trial court in refusing to execute the original judgment)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the doctrine of immutability of final judgments and reinstated the original judgment amount of P1,600.20 to be reimbursed by Correa to the Spouses Gomez. The award of attorney's fees to Correa was reversed. The case underscores the principle that final judgments cannot be modified, except for clerical errors or void judgments, and highlights the importance of consistent application of legal interest rates.
