**Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Diloy, G.R. No. 174633 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Municipal Circuit Trial Court's (MCTC) grant of Gregoria L. Diloy's application for land registration under Section 14 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Application for Registration:** Diloy filed for registration of title over a 22,249 sq. m. parcel in Barangay Dagatan, Amadeo, Cavite, claiming continuous, open, exclusive, and notorious possession under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, by herself and her predecessors-in-interest.
*   **Republic's Opposition:** The Republic opposed, arguing Diloy failed to prove the required period of possession under P.D. 1529, Section 14. The land was declared alienable and disposable only on March 15, 1982, by Forestry Administration Order (FAO) No. 4-1650. Thus, Diloy's possession, tacked to her predecessors, did not meet the 30-year requirement from June 12, 1945.
*   **Diloy's Evidence:** Diloy presented tax declarations dating back to 1948 (Crispin Leaban), transfer of ownership within the family (Eusebio Leaban to Pacencia Leaban to Diloy), and testimonial evidence from her father (Rustico Diloy) and a neighbor (Armando Ramos) regarding possession and cultivation.
*   **MCTC Ruling:** Granted Diloy's application.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the MCTC decision.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted the Republic's Petition, reversing the CA and MCTC. The Supreme Court acknowledged the possession was open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious, but found that Diloy failed to prove possession *under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier*, as required by Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529. Critical Point: The land was not alienable and disposable until March 15, 1982. Possession before this date is inconsequential and cannot be counted towards the 30-year requirement.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Applicant for land registration under Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529 bears the burden of proving (1) the land is alienable and disposable; (2) open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession; (3) bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Retroactive Application:**  The critical point is that even though tax declarations and familial possession were established prior to the 1982 classification of alienability and disposability, they were deemed irrelevant for the purposes of counting towards the 30-year possession requirement of P.D. 1529. This emphasizes the strict adherence to the disposability date as the starting point.
*   **Tacking of Possession:** The document clearly states that the possession of Diloy and her predecessors-in-interest cannot be tacked onto each other because the subject property was not classified as alienable and disposable land during those periods. The act of declaring land for taxation purposes does not automatically mean the property is now alienable.
*   **Ambiguity regarding "Bona Fide Claim":** While the court focused on the date of alienability, the case also raises the standard for "bona fide claim of ownership." While tax declarations and familial transfer suggest a claim, the absence of alienability prior to 1982 undermined this claim in the eyes of the Court.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14:**  Central statutory basis for the application.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 144057, 17 January 2005:**  Cited for the three requisites for filing a registration application under Section 14(1).
*   **Republic v. De Guzman, 383 Phil. 479 (2000):** Emphasized that possession before declaration of alienability cannot be considered.
*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Herbieto, G.R. No. 156117, 26 May 2005:** Reiterated the exclusion of pre-alienability possession in computing the period.
*   **Bracewell v. Court of Appeals, 380 Phil. 156 (2000):** No imperfect title can be confirmed over unclassified public land.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a clear warning that even long-standing possession and continuous tax payments are insufficient to establish registrable title under Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529 if the land was not declared alienable and disposable by June 12, 1945, or if possession before that date cannot be established for 30 years, in this case. This underlines the importance of establishing the *date of alienability and disposability* as a threshold requirement.
