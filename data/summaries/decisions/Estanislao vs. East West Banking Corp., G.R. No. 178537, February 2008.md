## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Estanislao v. East West Banking Corporation* (G.R. No. 178537)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of a replevin suit.

**Facts:** Petitioners obtained a loan from Respondent Bank, secured by two chattel mortgages over heavy equipment. Upon default, Respondent filed a replevin suit. During settlement negotiations, a *Deed of Assignment* was drafted, whereby Petitioners would assign certain equipment in *full payment* of their debt. Petitioners signed and delivered the assigned equipment. Respondent failed to sign the deed, then later amended the complaint to include equipment from the second chattel mortgage, claiming oversight in the original filing.

**Key Issue:** Did the unexecuted Deed of Assignment, coupled with the delivery and acceptance of the assigned equipment, extinguish Petitioners' debt and render the replevin suit untenable?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held in favor of the Petitioners, finding that the Deed of Assignment, in conjunction with the delivery and acceptance of the equipment, constituted a *dation en pago* (Art. 1245, Civil Code) which extinguished the debt. The Court reinstated the RTC decision dismissing the replevin suit.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Assignment:** Assignor (Petitioners) assigns specified equipment to Assignee (Bank) in *full payment* of debt.
*   **Obligation:** Petitioners to deliver equipment as per Deed of Assignment.
*   **Acceptance:** Bank's acceptance of equipment, even without formal signature on the Deed, signifies consent.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Bank's Risk:** Claiming "oversight" is weak, potentially bordering on bad faith. Estoppel applies due to acceptance of equipment and subsequent delay in pursuing the second chattel mortgage.
*   **Petitioner's Risk (Mitigated):** The risk of fulfilling the original loan obligations is extinguished based on the perfected dation en pago.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1245, Civil Code (Dation in Payment):** Governs the assignment of property to satisfy a debt.
*   **Art. 1319, Civil Code (Consent):** Offer and acceptance are essential for contract formation. Acceptance can be inferred from conduct.
*   **Art. 1371, Civil Code (Interpretation of Contracts):** Contemporaneous and subsequent acts of parties are considered in interpreting intent.
*   **BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 102998 (1996):** Defines replevin.
*   **Fule v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112212 (1998):** Deals with manifest negligence in contracts.
*   **Naguiat v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118375 (2003):** The validity of a chattel mortgage depends on the validity of the underlying loan.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "*full payment*" in the Deed of Assignment is crucial. The Court interpreted it literally to mean complete extinguishment of debt upon delivery and acceptance of the specified assets.
*   The lack of the Bank's signature is contentious. However, the Court found that the Bank's actions (accepting delivery) ratified the agreement.

**Legal Advice:**

The Supreme Court emphasized that the deed of assignment was binding on both parties, especially after the petitioners fulfilled their obligation, despite the bank not formally signing. The bank should have protested or acted upon the issue immediately. Failing that, the bank's actions are seen as an agreement to the assignment, thus ending the petitioners' obligation to them. The ruling effectively bars any further claims against the petitioners stemming from the original debt. The risk has completely shifted to the bank.
