**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Jaime Medina y Banag and Virgilio Carlos* (G.R. No. 127157, July 10, 1998)

**Summary:**

This is an automatic review of a lower court decision finding Accused-Appellant Medina guilty of violating Section 15 of Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), specifically for the illegal sale of 306.71 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu") in conspiracy with Virgilio Carlos, who remained at large. The lower court initially imposed the death penalty. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of P500,000.00.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Illegal sale of regulated drugs (shabu) under Section 15 of RA 6425.
*   **Entrapment:** Buy-bust operation conducted by the Narcotics Intelligence and Suppression Unit (NISU).
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court held that Medina conspired with Carlos, despite Medina's claim of being a mere bystander. His actions, specifically verifying the buyer's money and signaling Carlos, established a prior agreement and common purpose. The principle that in a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all conspirators, was applied.
*   **Evidence:** Testimony of police officers deemed credible, while Medina's conflicting affidavits and testimony diminished his credibility.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Lower court's finding of craft, fraud, or disguise was rejected as it related to the escape of Carlos and not directly to the crime charged.
*   **Penalty:**  Supreme Court modified the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* because the aggravating circumstances were improperly considered, and imposed a fine of P500,000.00, which the lower court neglected.

**Obligations:**

*   Medina is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay a fine of P500,000.00.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for violation of Section 15 of RA 6425.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Sentence:** The State has the obligation to enforce the imposed sentence.
*   **Carlos's Apprehension:**  The risk of Carlos's eventual apprehension and separate prosecution remains, potentially leading to additional proceedings and appeals.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425, Section 15:** The primary law under which Medina was charged and convicted. Defines the offense of illegal sale of regulated drugs and prescribes the penalty.
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Applies suppletorily to the Dangerous Drugs Act. Specifically, Article 63(2) regarding the application of penalties when there are two indivisible penalties.
*   **People vs. Simon (G.R. No. 93028, July 29, 1994):** Established the suppletory application of the Revised Penal Code to the Dangerous Drugs Act as amended by RA 7659.
*   **People vs. Patog (G.R. No. 69620, September 24, 1986):** Established the rule on collective responsibility of malefactors in a conspiracy

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lower court's initial appreciation of craft, fraud, or disguise was contentious, as it was unrelated to the illegal sale of shabu. The Supreme Court correctly reversed this.

**Notes for the Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of establishing conspiracy in drug cases. The court relied heavily on circumstantial evidence (Medina's actions) to infer the existence of a conspiracy. Note the court's reliance on established case law regarding the credibility of witnesses and the burden of proof in criminal cases.
