## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Jose Marie M. Rufino, et al.* (G.R. No. 175644 & 175702)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision on the valuation of land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the RTC's valuation based on the market data approach instead of adhering to the formula prescribed in DAR Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 1992 (DAR AO 6-92), as amended by DAR Administrative Order No. 11, Series of 1994 (DAR AO 11-94).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Section 17 of RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Mandates consideration of specific factors (cost of acquisition, current value of like properties, nature, actual use and income, sworn valuation by the owner, tax declarations, government assessment, social and economic benefits, and non-payment of taxes/loans) in determining just compensation.
*   **DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94:** Provides a specific formula for land valuation based on Capitalized Net Income (CNI), Comparable Sales (CS), and Market Value per Tax Declaration (MV). The formula varies depending on the availability and relevance of each factor.
*   **LBP and DAR obligations:** LBP is responsible for land valuation based on RA 6657 and DAR regulations. DAR is responsible for implementing CARP, including the issuance of relevant administrative orders.
*   **Respondents obligations:** Provide accurate information about the land and cooperate with the valuation process.

**Liabilities:**

*   **LBP:** Potentially liable to pay additional compensation to landowners if the original valuation is deemed insufficient.
*   **Republic of the Philippines:** Liable to pay just compensation for lands expropriated under CARP.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Undervaluation of Land:** Risks of violating the constitutional right to just compensation if valuation methods are not compliant with law.
*   **Protracted Litigation:** Risks of further legal battles due to ambiguous interpretation or application of valuation methods.
*   **Non-Compliance with Statutory Requirements:** Risks of invalidation of valuations due to incorrect dates used as a basis for computing Capitalized Net Income (CNI), Average Gross Production (AGP), Selling Price (SP), or the Regional Consumer Price Index (RCPI).

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Establishes the legal framework for CARP and just compensation.
*   **DAR AO 6-92, as amended by DAR AO 11-94:** Provides the administrative formula for determining just compensation.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Banal* (G.R. No. 143276):** Emphasizes the mandatory nature of Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO 6-92 in fixing land valuation.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada* (G.R. No. 164876):** Affirms that administrative regulations have the force of law.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim* (G.R. No. 171941):** Reiterates the mandatory nature of Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO 6-92 and clarifies that they are not mere guides.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Date of Taking:** The document disputes whether the acquisition was by Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) or Compulsory Acquisition (CA), affecting the determination of the applicable dates for the calculations within the formula set by DAR AO. This must be definitively established, if possible, to determine the date when the landowners offered their land or received notice of CARP coverage.
*   **Commissioner's Improper Application:** The report notes multiple areas where the LBP's commissioner failed to follow administrative rules and regulations, especially by using the wrong dates to compute Capitalized Net Income (CNI), Average Gross Production (AGP), Selling Price (SP), and the Regional Consumer Price Index (RCPI).
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 5, series of 1998:** The document notes that LBPâ€™s commissioner relied on DAR A.O. 5, s. 1998 to perform his computations. The court notes that this order took effect *after* the relevant dates for this case, therefore A.O. 5, s. 1998 is inapplicable.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **REVERSED** the CA decision and **REMANDED** the case to the RTC. The RTC is directed to determine just compensation strictly in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO 6-92, as amended.

**Next Steps:**

*   RTC to re-evaluate the land based on proper application of RA 6657 and DAR AO 6-92/11-94.
*   Potentially re-appoint commissioners to ascertain facts relevant to the valuation.
*   Determine the applicable dates for the calculations, namely, date of offer for VOS or date of notice of coverage for CA, and the date when LBP received the claimfolder.
