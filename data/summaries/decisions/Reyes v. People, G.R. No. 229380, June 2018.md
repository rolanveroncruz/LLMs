## Legal Document Summary: *Leniza Reyes y Capistrano v. People of the Philippines* G.R. No. 229380

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmation of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the petitioner, Leniza Reyes y Capistrano (Reyes), for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Illegal possession of 0.04 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty; sentenced to 12 years and 1 day (minimum) to 13 years (maximum) imprisonment and a fine of P300,000.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction, modified the penalty to 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months based on the correction of quantity of shabu as only 0.04 gram.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed and Set Aside the CA's decision: Acquitted.
*   **Constitutional Right Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure:** Reiterates Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution regarding search warrants and Section 3(2), Article III excluding illegally obtained evidence.
*   **Warrantless Arrests (Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure):** States the three lawful instances of warrantless arrests: in flagrante delicto, hot pursuit, and escaped prisoner.
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, Article II of RA 9165):** Emphasizes the need for physical inventory and photograph of seized items in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official.

**Obligations:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Compliance with Section 5, Rule 113 and Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.
*   **Prosecution:** Burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt, validity of arrest, and unbroken chain of custody.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Potential criminal liability for possession of illegal drugs if arrest, search, and seizure are lawful, and chain of custody is maintained.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Warrantless Arrest:** The central contention revolves around the legality of the warrantless arrest. The Court found it invalid because the accused was merely walking and smelling of liquor, which is not *in flagrante delicto*. Based on *People v. Villareal*, the act of walking while reeking of liquor per se cannot be considered a criminal act.
*   **Lack of Personal Knowledge:** The arresting officer based his actions on a tip. *Veridiano v. People* and *People v. Villareal* establish that a hearsay tip is insufficient for a warrantless arrest without the officer having personal knowledge of a crime being committed.
*   **Voluntary Surrender/Consent to Search:** The prosecution's argument that the accused voluntarily showed the drugs is inconsistent. The Court also found that clear and positive proof was lacking in showing that consent was obtained.
*   **Chain of Custody Violations:** The Court noted that only the Barangay Captain was present during the marking and inventory of the seized items. Citing *People v. Ceralde*, The unjustified non-compliance with the chain of custody procedure results in the acquittal of the accused.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Dahil, 750 Phil. 212 (2015):** An appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review.
*   **Miguel v. People, G.R. No. 227038, July 31, 2017:** Discusses unlawful search and seizure and warrantless arrests.
*   **Comerciante v. People, 764 Phil. 627 (2015):** Further elaborates on warrantless arrests.
*   **People v. Cogaed, 740 Phil. 212 (2014):** Carrying a bag and traveling aboard a jeepney without acting suspiciously cannot be grounds for a warrantless arrest.
*   **People v. Racho, 640 Phil. 669 (2010):** A search based solely on a tip without any overt act from the accused is illegal.
*   **People v. Tudtud, 458 Phil. 752 (2003):** Defines "personal knowledge" in warrantless arrests.
*   **Veridiano v. People, G.R. No. 200370, June 7, 2017:** Emphasizes that a hearsay tip alone does not justify a warrantless arrest.
*   **People v. Nuevas, 545 Phil. 356 (2007):** In order to deem as valid a consensual search, it is required that the police authorities expressly ask, and in no uncertain terms, obtain the consent of the accused to be searched.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 11, Article II:** Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs
*   **1987 Constitution, Article III, Sections 2 and 3(2):** Right against unreasonable searches and seizures; Exclusionary rule.
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 113, Section 5:** Warrantless Arrests.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing an illegal warrantless arrest due to the lack of *in flagrante delicto*. The officers relied on a tip without observing any suspicious or illegal activity. The chain of custody was also compromised. The evidence was therefore inadmissible, and the accused was acquitted.
