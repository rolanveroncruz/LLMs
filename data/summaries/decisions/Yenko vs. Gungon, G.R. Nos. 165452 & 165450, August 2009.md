Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown, for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Yenko v. Gungon*, G.R. Nos. 165450 & 165452, August 13, 2009 (612 Phil. 881)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari re: Court of Appeals' Amended Decision reinstating Raul Nestor C. Gungon to his former position with back salaries.

**Facts:**

*   Gungon held a permanent position as Local Assessment Operations Officer III in San Juan.
*   He was reassigned to the Public Order and Safety Office (POSO) to work as a security guard, with significantly different duties, schedule, and perceived reduction in rank/status.
*   Gungon protested the reassignment as a demotion and violation of security of tenure and refused to report to the POSO.
*   He was subsequently dropped from the rolls for AWOL (absence without official leave).
*   Gungon appealed to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which dismissed his appeal, affirming his being dropped from the rolls.
*   Gungon then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which initially granted back salaries but denied reinstatement due to terminal leave.
*   The Court of Appeals then modified its decision, granting reinstatement and five years of back salaries.
**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals Amended Decision with a slight modification.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Security of Tenure:**  The core issue revolves around Gungon's right to security of tenure under the Constitution, the Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292), and Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
*   **Reassignment (EO 292, Book V, Title 1, Subtitle A, Chapter 5, Sec. 26(7)):** Reassignment is permissible within an agency *provided* it does not involve a reduction in rank, status, or salary.
*   **AWOL (CSC Memorandum Circular No. 38, series of 1993, as amended):**  Absence without approved leave for 30 days or more is grounds for being dropped from the rolls.
*   **Terminal Leave (Sec. 6 of the original Rule XVI of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, now Sec. 26):** Voluntary application for terminal leave has been applied.
* Backwages for illegally dismissed civil service employee limited to a maximum of five years

**Liabilities & Remedies:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  Gungon was illegally dismissed, entitling him to reinstatement to his former position without qualification.
*   **Back Salaries:** Gungon is entitled to back salaries for a maximum of five years from the date he was dropped from the rolls (March 1, 1998).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Exigency of Service" Justification:** The municipality's asserted "exigency of service" for the reassignment was deemed insufficient to overcome the prohibition against demotion/reduction.
*   **Discretion of Appointing Authority:** The CA initially made reinstatement subject to the discretion of the appointing authority but the Supreme Court explicitly removed this qualification, clarifying the ministerial duty to reinstate after illegal dismissal.
* The ruling clarifies the limited discretion of the employer in cases of illegal dismissal and the employee's rights to reinstatement and back salaries, and highlights the distinction between voluntary and involuntary separation from service, the original Sec. 6, Rule XVI

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **EO 292 (Administrative Code of 1987), Book V, Title 1, Subtitle A, Chapter 5, Sec. 26 (7):** Defines permissible reassignment.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 38, series of 1993, as amended:**  Addresses AWOL and being dropped from the rolls.
* CSC Memorandum Circular No. 41
* Section 6, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of *Dytiapco v. Civil Service Commission* (G.R. No. 92136, July 3, 1992, 211 SCRA 88) regarding the acceptance of terminal leave benefits not automatically constituting abandonment of reinstatement claims was critical.

**Concise Assessment:**

The case underscores the protection of civil service employees' security of tenure.  The core finding is that a reassignment resulting in a reduction in rank or status is a violation of law. This reassignment resulted in an illegal dismissal and the remedy for this being reinstatement and back salaries. The court clarified the limited discretion of the employer in cases of illegal dismissal.
