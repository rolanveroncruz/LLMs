## Legal Document Summary: Figueroa v. People

**Case:** G.R. No. 147406, July 14, 2008 (580 Phil. 58)

**Subject Matter:** Reckless imprudence resulting in homicide; jurisdiction of courts; estoppel by laches.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Issue:** Whether a litigant is estopped by laches from assailing the jurisdiction of a tribunal, despite raising the issue on appeal; and relatedly, whether active participation in trial constitutes estoppel.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The case involves a criminal charge of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide. At the time the information was filed, Republic Act No. 7691 amended B.P. Blg. 129, conferring jurisdiction over offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) years to the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MTCs), Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs), and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTCs), not the RTC.
*   **Laches & Estoppel:** The Court analyzes the doctrine of estoppel by laches in relation to jurisdiction, examining various cases including *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*. It highlights that estoppel by laches only supervenes in exceptional cases analogous to *Sibonghanoy*, where lack of jurisdiction is raised belatedly enough to warrant the presumption of abandonment.
*   **Holding:** The Court ruled that the RTC of Bulacan lacked jurisdiction over the case because the offense fell under the jurisdiction of the MTC. Furthermore, the petitioner was not estopped by laches from raising the jurisdictional issue on appeal to the CA.

**Liabilities:**

*   The CA affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty. The Supreme Court reversed the CA ruling.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Application of *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*:** The case underscores the need for cautious application of the *Sibonghanoy* doctrine, clarifying it as an exception to the general rule that jurisdiction can be raised at any time. Courts must assess the factual milieu to determine the existence of laches before applying estoppel.
*   **Undefined Timeline for Laches:** While the Court states a considerable period had not elapsed for laches to attach in this specific case, it does not provide a clear timeframe for when laches will be applicable.
*   **Other Issues:** The Court did not resolve the other issues raised by the petitioner, which pertained to the sufficiency of evidence for conviction, the speed limit at the accident site, the lack of specific allegations in the information and the testimony of a witness.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129:** The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691 (Expanding the Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts).
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 365:** Defines and penalizes reckless imprudence.
*   ***Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*, 131 Phil. 556 (1968):** Landmark case on estoppel by laches in challenging jurisdiction.
*   ***Calimlim v. Ramirez*, 204 Phil. 25 (1982):** Clarifies that *Sibonghanoy* is an exception and should not be applied as a general rule.
*   ***Metromedia Times Corporation v. Pastorin*, G.R. No. 154295, July 29, 2005:** Reiterates that *Sibonghanoy* is the exception rather than the rule.
*   ***Regalado v. Go*, G.R. No. 167988, February 6, 2007:** Again emphasizes that laches should be clearly present for the *Sibonghanoy* doctrine to be applicable

**Legally Precise Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of proper jurisdictional determination at the inception of a case. While estoppel by laches can bar a party from challenging jurisdiction belatedly, this principle applies only in exceptional circumstances similar to *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*, where the delay is unreasonable and unexplained, warranting a presumption of abandonment. The ruling reinforces the general rule that lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and cannot be conferred by consent or waiver. Criminal Case No. 2235- M-94 was dismissed without prejudice due to lack of jurisdiction of the RTC.
