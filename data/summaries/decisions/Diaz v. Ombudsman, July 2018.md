## Legal Document Summary: Diaz v. Office of the Ombudsman (G.R. No. 203217)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Office of the Ombudsman's (OMB) decision finding Petitioner, Jose L. Diaz, guilty of Dishonesty and dismissing him from service.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Dishonesty, specifically illegal use of public funds (gasoline) for personal use and for vehicles that were already decommissioned or declared unserviceable.
*   **Evidence:** The Office of the Ombudsman relied heavily on "Gasoline Fuel Supplies Ledger Cards (SLC)" showing withdrawals for decommissioned/unserviceable vehicles (Toyota Land Cruiser with plate no. SCB-995 and engine number 406Y18) and Diaz's personal vehicle (PPR-691). Diaz was Division Head of the Veterinary Inspection Board (VIB) and responsible for approving these withdrawals. He also received transportation allowances during the same period.
*   **Diaz's Defense:** Denied the charges, claiming the vehicle was used despite being declared unserviceable due to an engine replacement. Denied knowledge of withdrawals for his personal vehicle. Contested the SLC's reliability.
*   **Ombudsman Ruling:** Found Diaz guilty of Dishonesty under Section 52(A)(l), Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS). Penalty: Dismissal from service, cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from government re-employment.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the Ombudsman's decision, finding substantial evidence to support the finding of dishonesty. Rejected Diaz's arguments regarding the unreliability of the SLC as they were considered public documents with *prima facie* validity.

**Obligations:**

*   Diaz, as a public official, had a duty to use public funds and property honestly and for official purposes only.

**Liabilities:**

*   Diaz was found administratively liable for Dishonesty, resulting in dismissal and other penalties.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The Court applied the "substantial evidence" standard, which is a lower threshold than "proof beyond reasonable doubt" required in criminal cases. The Court reiterated it would not re-evaluate evidence already considered by lower tribunals, absent specific exceptions to this rule.
*   **Weight of Public Documents:** The Court relied heavily on the SLCs as public documents, giving them *prima facie* validity. This could be contentious if there were specific allegations of fabrication or manipulation of the documents that were not adequately addressed. The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties was applied against Diaz.
*   **Penalty:** The penalty of dismissal for Dishonesty under URACCS is seemingly strict. Diaz argued for a more lenient penalty considering his 22 years of service and lack of prior offenses, but the Court rejected this argument, citing the gravity of the offense and the repeated violations over a period of years. This aligns with established jurisprudence.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** While the initial complaint included violations of RA 3019, the final decision focused solely on the administrative offense of dishonesty.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Article 220):** Similarly, while initially part of the complaint, the final decision did not pursue violations under this article.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (URACCS), Section 52(A)(l), Rule IV:** The basis for the finding of Dishonesty and the imposition of the penalty of dismissal, cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification. Section 58(a) confirms additional penalties.
*   **Tecson v. COMELEC:** Cited regarding the trustworthiness of public documents.
*   **Balasbas v. Monayao:** Used for the definition of Dishonesty.
*   **Medina v. Commission on Audit and Concerned Employees v. Nuestro:** Cited regarding the severity of dishonesty and the appropriateness of dismissal despite length of service.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The continued use of the vehicle despite being declared unserviceable and engine decommission creates ambiguity. The resolution turns on Diaz's knowledge, authorization, and use of funds tied to this vehicle.
*   Diaz's acknowledgement of PPR-691 as his personal vehicle solidifies this point and weakens the case for appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Diaz due to dishonesty based on substantial evidence. The Court gave significant weight to the SLC as public documents and upheld the penalty of dismissal, citing the gravity of the offense. The risk lies in the heavy reliance on documentation that could be contested and a relatively inflexible application of URACCS penalties.
