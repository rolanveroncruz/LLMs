## Legal Document Summary: *Polanco v. Cruz* (G.R. No. 182426)

**Case:** *Zenaida Polanco, et al. v. Carmen Cruz* (G.R. No. 182426, February 13, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision setting aside RTC's dismissal for failure to prosecute.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Damages claim by Carmen Cruz (Respondent), represented by her attorney-in-fact, against Zenaida Polanco, et al. (Petitioners) for allegedly destroying her palay crops.
*   **Dismissal by RTC:** RTC initially dismissed the case for failure to prosecute due to Respondent's failure to promptly move for pre-trial.
*   **Reversal by CA:** CA reversed, holding that Respondent's prior actions (filing oppositions, answers, etc.) did not indicate a lack of interest in prosecuting the case and that the dismissal was too severe given the circumstances. CA remanded the case for further proceedings.

**Obligations:**

*   **Plaintiff's Duty (pre-AM 03-1-09-SC):** Prior to the effectivity of AM 03-1-09-SC (August 16, 2004),  Rule 18 Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure imposes a duty on the plaintiff to promptly move ex parte to set the case for pre-trial after the last pleading has been served and filed. A failure to do so can result in dismissal under Rule 17 Section 3.
*   **Plaintiff's Duty (post-AM 03-1-09-SC):** After August 16, 2004 AM 03-1-09-SC, within five days from the date of filing a reply the plaintiff must promptly move ex parte for the case to be set for pre-trial. If they do not the Branch COC must issue a notice of pre-trial.
*   **Clerk of Court's Duty (post-AM 03-1-09-SC):** Under A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC, in effect at the time, the Clerk of Court is ultimately responsible for setting the pre-trial if the plaintiff fails to promptly move.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of Petitioners:** If the case proceeds to trial and the Respondent prevails, Petitioners could be held liable for actual, moral, and exemplary damages, litigation expenses, attorney's fees, and costs of suit, as claimed in the original complaint.
*   **Respondent's Liability:** While not explicitly addressed, if Respondent's claims are ultimately proven false or without merit, she could be subject to claims for malicious prosecution or similar torts.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping Allegation:** Petitioners argued Respondent engaged in forum shopping by mentioning her status as a tenant in the Complaint when an unlawful detainer case involving the same land was ongoing. The SC ruled that there was no forum shopping as there was no identity of reliefs prayed for. The damages case and the unlawful detainer case sought different remedies, thereby not violating the rule against forum shopping. Risk persists that forum shopping allegations will be made and potentially litigated in the trial court.
*   **Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute:** While the CA reversed the initial dismissal, the possibility of a dismissal for failure to prosecute always exists if the Respondent fails to diligently pursue the case or comply with court orders moving forward.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The success of Respondent's claim hinges on her ability to prove the damages to her palay crops and Petitioners' responsibility for those damages.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 17, Sec. 3:** Dismissal due to fault of plaintiff.
*   **1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 18, Sec. 1:** Duty to move for pre-trial.
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC (Guidelines for Pre-Trial):** Aimed at accelerating court proceedings. This case highlighted that under the guidelines the branch COC must ultimately issue a notice of pre-trial.
*   **Olave v. Mistas (G.R. No. 155193):** Discussed the circumstances under which dismissal for failure to prosecute is warranted.
*Rasdas v.Estenor, G.R. No. 157605, December 13, 2005, 477 SCRA 538, 551
*National Electrification Administration (NEA) v. Buenaventura, G.R. No. 132453, February 14, 2008, 545 SCRA 277, 288-289

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Respondent's Status as Tenant:** Respondent's claim that she is a tenant, potentially giving rise to agrarian law issues under R.A. 6657.  Petitioners may argue that the proper forum for resolving the issue is the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB).

**Overall:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appealsâ€™ reinstatement of the case, finding that the respondent did not exhibit a pattern of delay and the ends of justice would be better served by a trial on the merits. The case now returns to the RTC. Focus will be on establishing facts to prove or disprove the damages claim and ensuring compliance with procedural rules, particularly those governing pre-trial and trial.
