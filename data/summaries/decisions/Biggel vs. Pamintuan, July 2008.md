**Legal Document Summary: *Biggel v. Judge Pamintuan***

**Case:** A.M. No. RTJ-08-2101 (Formerly OCA-I.P.I. No. 07-2763-RTJ)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Fernando Vil. Pamintuan for manifest partiality, gross misconduct, ignorance of the law, and unjust delay in resolving incidents in Criminal Case No. 25383-R (Estafa).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant (Biggel):** Alleged irregularities in the Estafa case, including a motion for reinvestigation unduly delayed by Judge Pamintuan. Key issues involve the increased bail without preliminary investigation, delay in resolving motions, and alleged bias.
*   **Respondent (Judge Pamintuan):** Defended actions by citing workload, absences of prosecutors, voluntary inhibition, and reliance on the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions. Claimed he expedited matters as best as he could.
*   **OCA Finding:** Found Judge Pamintuan guilty of undue delay in rendering an order.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Duty (Rule 3.05, Code of Judicial Conduct):** Duty to dispose of court business promptly. Failure to do so violates judicial code of conduct.
*   **Section 9 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court**: Undue delay in rendering an order is a less serious charge.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Erosion of Public Trust:** Undue delay damages public confidence in the judiciary.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** The judge is liable for administrative penalties due to the established delay.

**Key Precedents and Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution:** Mandates lower courts to dispose of cases promptly.
*   **Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct**: Requires judges to dispose of court business promptly.
*   **Section 9 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court**: Undue delay in rendering a decision or order is a less serious charge.

*   *Atty. Beltran, Jr. v. Atty. Paderanga*, 455 Phil. 227, 234 (2003).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "urgency" of the motion for reinvestigation is contentious given the lack of strict legal deadline, but repeated delays suggest an issue.
*   The reasons provided for the delays by Judge Pamintuan are subjective and open to interpretation regarding whether they constituted "undue" delay.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court found Judge Pamintuan guilty of violating Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   A fine of P20,000.00 was imposed, with a stern warning against repetition.

**Prior Disciplinary Records:**

*   The Judge had prior disciplinary actions, including suspension, fines, and reprimands, indicating a history of ethical and procedural violations. This history exacerbates the current infraction.
