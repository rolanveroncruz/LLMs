**Legal Document Summary: Philippine National Construction Corporation vs. Felix M. Erece, Jr. et al. (G.R. No. 235673)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which set aside the NLRC decision dismissing the respondents' complaint for payment of driver's allowance, damages, and attorney's fees due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the Labor Arbiter or the Commission on Audit (COA) has jurisdiction over the respondents' money claims for a "driver's allowance" that was discontinued.
*   **PNCC Status:** The document confirms PNCC's status as a Government-Owned and Controlled Corporation (GOCC) *without* an original charter.
*   **Allowance Nature:** The court defines the subject allowance as a monthly transportation allowance, which may be used for fuel consumption or as compensation for a personal driver.
*   **Diminution of Benefits (Art. 100 Labor Code):**  The core dispute involves the applicability of Article 100 of the Labor Code, which prohibits the diminution of benefits. The respondents claim the discontinuance of the allowance violates this provision.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **denied** the petition, affirming the CA's ruling that the Labor Arbiter had jurisdiction over the money claims. However, the Court *modified* the CA decision, holding that the respondents have **no vested right** to the allowance, and the withdrawal **does not constitute a diminution of benefits**.

**Key Arguments & Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdiction Rationale:** The Court states that absent a *Notice of Disallowance* from the COA, the agency does not have primary jurisdiction. Instead, the Labor Arbiter does. While the COA's general jurisdiction extends to government agencies, it doesn't automatically supersede the Labor Code regarding employee claims against GOCCs without charters. The court cites Article 217 of the Labor Code, granting Labor Arbiters exclusive jurisdiction over employee money claims.
*   **Non-Diminution Inapplicability:** The most critical aspect is the court's finding that the allowance's grant was erroneous because it violated COA Circular No. 77-61, which prohibits GOCC officials already provided with service vehicles to receive transportation allowance.
*   **COA Circular No. 77-61:**  Cited as law, the PNCC withdrawal was aimed at complying with COA Circular No. 77-61, the Court explains the rule against diminution of benefits doesn't apply to unlawful compensation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Article 100 (Non-Diminution of Benefits), Article 217 (Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters)
*   **Government Auditing Code (PD 1445):** Sections 26, 48
*   **Republic Act No. 10149 (GOCC Governance Act of 2011):**  Compensation and Position Classification System.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Strategic Alliance Development Corporation v. Radstock Securities Ltd.:** Establishes PNCC's status as a GOCC without original charter.
*   **Alejandrino v. Commission on Audit:** Reaffirms PNCC status as a GOCC
*   **Cuenca v. Atas & PNCC v. Pabion:**  Cited by respondents to argue PNCC as a private corporation.
*   **Corales v. Republic:** Defines Audit Observation Memorandum.
*   **Taisei Shimizu Joint Venture v. Commission on Audit:**  Clarifies COA jurisdiction.
*   **Trade Unions of the Philippines and Allied Services v. National Housing Corp.:** Explains GOCC governance.
*   **Philippine National Construction Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Diminution of benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on COA Circular:** The court relies heavily on the COA circular to justify reversing the allowance. Any challenge to the validity or applicability of this circular could undermine the court's reasoning.
*   **Employee Morale:**  The decision, while legally sound, could negatively affect employee morale, as it upholds the withdrawal of a previously granted benefit, albeit an unauthorized one.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PNCC:**  Has no obligation to continue providing the allowance. Complied by following COA regulations.
*   **Employees:** Have no legal claim to the allowance as the COA Circular prevents them from having it.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court ultimately favors PNCC, allowing the discontinuance of the allowance. The decision hinges on the prohibition in COA Circular 77-61, which overrides the non-diminution principle under the Labor Code.
