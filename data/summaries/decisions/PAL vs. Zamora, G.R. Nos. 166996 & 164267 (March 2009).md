**Case Summary: Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Heirs of Bernardin J. Zamora (G.R. Nos. 164267 & 166996)**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions assailing decisions of the Court of Appeals regarding illegal dismissal, unfair labor practice, and related claims.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Employee's Allegations:** Bernardin J. Zamora, a cargo representative, alleged illegal transfer for refusing to participate in supervisor Abuyuan's smuggling. He reported smuggling activities and was subsequently transferred, salaries were withheld, and ultimately terminated for insubordination and AWOL.
*   **Employer's (PAL) Allegations:** Zamora had an altercation with Abuyuan, refused transfer to DCO, and was subsequently reported AWOL.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed Zamora's complaint.
    *   National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) reversed, declaring the transfer illegal and ordering reinstatement and backwages.
    *   PAL appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Legal Issues and Holdings:**

1.  **Finality of NLRC Decision:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA ruling that the NLRC decision became final and executory due to PAL's failure to file a timely motion for reconsideration. Service was deemed complete five days after the first notice, even though PAL claimed non-receipt.
2.  **Legality of Transfer:** The NLRC and CA found the transfer illegal.
3.  **Legality of Dismissal:** The dismissal was implicitly found to be illegal.
4.  **Reinstatement vs. Separation Pay:** The CA, as affirmed by the SC, ordered separation pay instead of reinstatement due to Zamora's incarceration for murder.
5.  **Rehabilitation Proceedings:** The SC acknowledged PAL's exit from rehabilitation proceedings, making direct payment obligations possible.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PAL is liable for:**
    *   Separation pay to Zamora's heirs, computed from February 9, 1981, to October 1, 2000 (date of incarceration).
    *   Backwages from December 15, 1995, to October 1, 2000.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   Rules on Service by Registered Mail: Establishes the rules for determining completeness of service and constructive service.
*   Rules on Notice of Change of Address: Requires parties to notify the court or agency of any change in address. *NIAConsult, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 108278, January 2, 1997): Reinforces the party's responsibility to provide a notice of change of address.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Service:** The Court relied on certifications from the NLRC Deputy Executive Clerk and the stamped markings on the envelope, and PAL's failure to notify the NLRC of change of address, rather than a postmaster's certification as traditionally required.
*   **Valuation of Backwages and Separation Pay:** Requires careful calculation and documentation.

**Ambiguities and Further Investigation:**

*   The precise basis for finding the initial transfer and subsequent dismissal illegal is somewhat implicit rather than explicitly stated in the SC decision. Further review of the LA and NLRC decisions might be necessary to understand the detailed reasoning.
*   Preference of Credit (as related to rehabilitation): If other claimants exist against PAL from its rehabilitation period, there could be potential disputes regarding the priority of Zamora's claim, although PAL is now out of rehabilitation.
