## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dagsa*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Edwin Dagsa y Bantas* G.R. No. 219889 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Original Charge:** Rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) and penalized under Article 266-B, paragraph 6(5), both of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353, in relation to RA 7610 (victim AAA, age 4).
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Rape. Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua* with damages (Civil, Moral, Exemplary) and interest.
*   **CA Ruling:** Modified to NOT GUILTY of rape, but guilty of **Acts of Lasciviousness** under Article 336 of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610. Indeterminate sentence of thirteen (13) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) days of *reclusion temporal* minimum, to sixteen (16) years, five (5) months and nine (9) days of *reclusion temporal* medium with damages and interest. Reasoning: Lack of proof of carnal knowledge; child victim’s statement did not qualify as *res gestae*. The variance doctrine enabled conviction for the crime of acts of lasciviousness.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA's conviction for Acts of Lasciviousness. Modified penalty to an indeterminate sentence of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* in its minimum period, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years six (6) months and twenty-one (21) days of *reclusion temporal* in its medium period, as maximum.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-appellant is liable for acts of lasciviousness committed against the victim and is required to serve the modified indeterminate sentence.
*   Accused-appellant is liable for the payment of damages awarded to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sentence Discrepancy:** The Court notes the potential anomaly in the existing statutory framework where the penalty for acts of lasciviousness against a child under 12 years old *may* be lower than the penalty for acts of lasciviousness against a child between 12-18 years old. This is raised as an issue for potential legislative correction. Also, the SC questions why “Sexual Assault” is punishable by *prision mayor*, while acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610, is punishable by the more severe penalty of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Lack of Medical Evidence:** The CA pointed to the original trial’s failure of the prosecution to present medical examination results despite the mother admitting it existed. Although the conviction was upheld by the supreme court, this could have been challenged more seriously.
*   **Child Witness Testimony:** The case relies heavily on the testimony of child witnesses. The court addressed the issue of the testimonies and their reliability.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity arises from the interaction between RA 7610 and RA 8353, specifically regarding the penalty for acts of lasciviousness against children of different age brackets.
*   The application of the *res gestae* rule with regards to the child's delayed disclosure to her mother.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding the accused guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness based primarily on the credible testimony of child witnesses and invoking the Variance Doctrine. However, the decision also highlights potential legislative gaps and inconsistencies regarding the penalties for child sexual abuse, which merit further review and potential corrective legislation.
