## Legal Document Summary: *Asetre v. Asetre*, G.R. No. 171536 (2009)

**Case Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision reversing the Department of Justice's (DOJ) resolution, which had ordered the withdrawal of charges of parricide and murder against the petitioners. The DOJ found insufficient evidence to establish conspiracy in the death of Hanz Dietrich Asetre, husband of petitioner April Joy Asetre. The CA reversed, finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOJ Secretary, concluding that circumstantial evidence indicated probable cause for parricide/murder. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, affirming the DOJ resolution.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Probable Cause:** Central issue is whether probable cause exists to indict petitioners for parricide (Art. 246, Revised Penal Code) and murder (Art. 248, RPC).
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence to support their claim that petitioners conspired to kill the victim.
*   **Role of Expert Testimony:** Admissibility and weight of the doctors' affidavits regarding the improbability of suicide, as compared to direct testimonies and other circumstantial evidence, is disputed.
*   **Power of DOJ Secretary:** The case hinges on the scope of the DOJ Secretary's power to review resolutions of subordinate prosecutors, as granted by Section 4, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. *Joaquin, Jr. v. Drilon* (G.R. No. 108946) and similar cases on the DOJ Secretary's power are relevant.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The CA alleged the DOJ Secretary acted with grave abuse of discretion, but the SC disagreed, stating that the DOJ Secretary's actions were not "capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction." *D.M. Consunji, Inc. v. Esguerra* (G.R. No. 118590) defines grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Forum Shopping:** Petitioners alleged private respondents were guilty of forum shopping for not informing the Court of Appeals that the RTC had already issued an order granting the withdrawal of the information.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecutors:** Duty to establish probable cause before filing charges (Rule 112, Rules of Court).
*   **DOJ Secretary:** Obligation to ensure evidence warrants filing an action in court, and to protect innocent persons from groundless prosecutions. *Vda. de Jacob v. Puno* (No. L-61554-55) supports the idea that the Secretary of Justice is bound by his oath of office to protect innocent persons from groundless, false or serious prosecutions.
*   **Petitioners:** Initially faced charges of parricide/murder, but these were dismissed based on the DOJ's finding of insufficient evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Medical Findings:** The medical findings were ambiguous, leading to differing interpretations regarding the cause of death (suicide vs. foul play).
*   **Interpretation of Circumstantial Evidence:** The weight and interpretation of the circumstantial evidence, particularly concerning the alleged cover-up and the petitioners' actions before, during, and after the death, were highly contentious.
*   **Lack of Conclusive Evidence of Conspiracy:** The prosecution failed to establish a clear motive or direct evidence of conspiracy among the petitioners. Art. 8, RPC requires agreement to commit the felony, which needs to be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence.
*   **Private physician's testimony lacked expertise:** Because Dr. Samson Gonzaga was not presented as a medical expert, their testimony's weight regarding whether the death was caused by murder was decreased.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case highlights the tension between the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion and the judiciary's power to review for grave abuse of discretion. The SC sided with the DOJ Secretary, emphasizing the broad discretion afforded to the executive branch in determining probable cause and ultimately finding that there was a lack of sufficient evidence to indict the petitioners. The case reiterates the high threshold for proving grave abuse of discretion and serves as a reminder of the limitations on judicial review of prosecutorial decisions.
