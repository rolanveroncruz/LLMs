## Legal Document Summary: *Atwel v. Concepcion Progressive Association, Inc.*, G.R. No. 169370

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC's ruling in a mandatory injunction case originally filed with the SEC.

**Key Issue:** Whether the doctrine of estoppel bars Petitioners from questioning the jurisdiction of the special commercial court (RTC Branch 8) after participating in proceedings.

**Facts:**

*   1948: Emiliano Melgazo founded CPA, an association.
*   1968: Melgazo, as CPA president, bought land for the association which was then converted to a wet market.
*   Melgazo died, son (petitioner Manuel Melgazo) became CPA president. Atwel and Pilpil are elected as CPA vice-president and treasurer, respectively.
*   1997: Other CPA officers formed CPAI and registered with the SEC. Petitioners were not listed.
*   2000: CPAI filed a mandatory injunction case (SEC Case No. 2001-07-110) against Petitioners in the SEC, arguing Petitioners were wrongly collecting rent from the wet market vendors.
*   Case transferred to RTC (special commercial court) due to RA 8799.
*   RTC ruled for CPAI, ordering Petitioners to cease collecting rent and account for past collections. RTC equated CPA with CPAI.
*   CA affirmed, stating that the Petitioners were estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the special commercial court based on active participation, citing *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Transferred jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes from SEC to RTCs.
*   **PD 902-A (Reorganization of the Securities and Exchange Commission):** Defined jurisdiction of the SEC; Section 5 details the nature of cases that are under the jurisdiction of the SEC. Now heard by the court, as granted by RA 8799.
*   **RTC Decision:** Orders Petitioners to cease collecting rent and account for past collections, effectively recognizing CPAI's ownership.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Right to Manage the Property:** The RTC ruling, if upheld, would deprive Petitioners of the right to manage the wet market and collect rents.
*   **Accounting Liability:** Potential liability for accounting for and turning over past rent collections.
*   **Civil Suit Risks:** Adverse finding on ownership could lead to further civil suits regarding the property's rightful ownership and management.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Equating CPA with CPAI:** The RTC's finding that CPA and CPAI are the same entity is questionable as the petitioners were not listed as the officers of CPAI. This is crucial as the Court based its decision on the deed of sale covering the property being in the name of CPA.
*   **Jurisdictional Basis:** The jurisdictional issue hinges on whether this is an intra-corporate dispute.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8799:** Transferred SEC jurisdiction to RTCs.
*   **PD 902-A, Section 5:** Defined original SEC jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes.
*   **Rule 130, Section 9 (Parole Evidence Rule):** Prevents contradicting terms of a written agreement, was cited to state that there was no doubt that CPA was the vendee, as written in the deed, and not Emiliano Melgazo.
*   ***Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*:** Case cited by the CA to justify estoppel argument. The Supreme Court found that this case represented an exceptional circumstance to void the trial court's decision for lack of jurisdiction.
*   ***Speed Distributing Corporation v. CA***: Case used to determine whether a case involves an intra-corporate controversy.
*   ***Lozon v. NLRC***: Case used to determine when jurisdiction by estoppel applies and when it does not.
*   ***Metromedia Times Corporation v. Pastorin***: Case cited to determine when a party may be barred by laches from invoking plea for the first time on appeal for the purpose of annulling everything done in the case with the active participation of said party invoking the plea.

**Analysis & Potential Arguments:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Strong argument exists that this is *not* an intra-corporate dispute as Petitioners are not members of CPAI. Therefore, the special commercial court lacked jurisdiction ab initio.  *Speed Distributing* applies, emphasizing both the relationship of the parties and the nature of the controversy.
*   **Estoppel Inapplicable:** The doctrine of estoppel *cannot* confer jurisdiction where it is lacking. The Petitioners are not estopped because this case does not meet the exceptional circumstances outlined in *Tijam*. The Court has made efforts to clarify the distinction, outlining that if the lower court *never* had jurisdiction, the party invoking the same, is not estopped.
*   **Ownership Dispute:** The core issue is a dispute over property ownership and management, a civil matter properly heard in a regular RTC.
*   **Parole Evidence Rule may be an issue.**
*   **CPA vs. CPAI:**  Challenge the RTC's finding of sameness.  Establish separate legal identities.

**Recommendation:**

*   Appeal the CA decision, focusing on the lack of subject matter jurisdiction of the special commercial court and the inapplicability of estoppel.
*   Argue that the matter is a civil matter, and the Court overstepped bounds when making decisions on matters concerning intra-corporate disputes, as the Petitioners were not members or officers of the CPAI.
*   Present evidence to refute the alleged identity between CPA and CPAI.
*   Be prepared to litigate the underlying ownership dispute in a separate, proper forum.
