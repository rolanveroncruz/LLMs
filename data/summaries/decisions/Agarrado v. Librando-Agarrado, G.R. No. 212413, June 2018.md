**Case Summary: Agarrado v. Librando-Agarrado, G.R. No. 212413 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming with modification the RTC's decision in an action for partition of real estate.

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) SET ASIDE the CA and RTC decisions, DISMISSING the complaint for lack of jurisdiction of the RTC.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Action for Partition:** The SC reiterated that an action for partition has two phases: (1) determination of co-ownership and (2) segregation and conveyance of shares.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC held that jurisdiction over partition cases is determined by Sections 19(2) and 33(3) of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980 (B.P. 129), as amended by R.A. No. 7691, based on the assessed value of the real property. The assessed value determines whether the RTC or the MTC has jurisdiction.
*   **Pleading Requirements:** The SC emphasized the necessity of alleging the assessed value of the property in the complaint. Failure to do so warrants dismissal. The SC cites *Foronda-Crystal v. Son, G.R. No. 221815, November 29, 2017* stating if the assessed value is not alleged in the complaint, it can be identified with a facial examination of attached documents.
*  **Inheritance:** Cristita, the second wife, is entitled to 2/9 of the property. Ma. Rosario, Ruth and Roy Agarrado are entitled to 6/9 plus Â¼ to be divided equally among them. Ana Lou Agarrado-King, the child of Rodrigo and Cristita is entitled to 1/9 of the property.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Dismissal for Lack of Jurisdiction:** The primary risk is dismissal if the complaint fails to allege the assessed value of the property. This case reinforces the principle of *Motu Proprio* dismissal of suits that do not comply with this procedural requirement.
*   **Re-filing the Case:** The dismissal is *without prejudice*, meaning the respondents can re-file the complaint in the proper court, *if* the jurisdictional amount permits.
*   **Determination of Heirs and Shares:** While not addressed due to the jurisdictional issue, the CA made specific orders with respect to the distribution of inheritance, subject to potential re-litigation if a new case is filed.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **B.P. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), Sections 19(2) and 33(3):** Determines jurisdiction based on assessed property value.
*   **Rule 69 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Governs partition of real estate.
*   ***Russel v. Vestil, 364 Phil. 392 (1999)***: Distinguished.  While actions of partition are incapable of pecuniary estimation, jurisdiction is dependent upon Sec. 33(3) of BP 129, as amended
*   ***Cabrera v. Francisco, 716 Phil. 574 (2013)***: States you determine whether an action is one incapable of pecuniary estimation by identifying the nature of the principal action or remedy sought.
*   ***Singson v. Isabela Sawmill, 177 Phil. 575 (1979)***: States where the basic issue is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, such actions are cases where the subject of the litigation may not be estimated in terms of money, and are cognizable exclusively by Regional Trial Courts.
*   ***Bagayas v. Bagayas, 718 Phil. 91, 98 (2013)***: Partition is at once an action (1) for declaration of co-ownership and (2) for segregation and conveyance of a determinate portion of the properties involved.
*   ***Barrido v. Nonato, G.R. No. 176492, October 20, 2014, 738 SCRA 510, 515-516***: Held that the Municipal Trial Court in Cities has jurisdiction when the assessed value of the subject property was P8,080.00.
*   ***Foronda-Crystal v. Son, G.R. No. 221815, November 29, 2017***: Key case establishing the rule that failure to allege the assessed value of property in the complaint results in dismissal. *Motu Proprio* dismissal.
*   ***Tumpag v. Tumpag, G.R. No. 199133, September 29, 2014, 737 SCRA 62, 69***: States the court should only look into the facts alleged in the complaint to determine whether a suit is within its jurisdiction.
*   ***Spouses Cruz v. Spouses Cruz, et al., 616 Phil. 519 (2009)***: States only facts alleged in the complaint can be the basis of the court's competence to take cognizance of a case.
*   ***Quinagoran v. Court of Appeals, 557 Phil. 650 (2007)***: Held that because the respondents failed to allege in their complaint the assessed value of the subject property, the RTC seriously erred in denying the motion to dismiss.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's determination of the specific fractional shares of the heirs, while seemingly straightforward, becomes moot due to the jurisdictional dismissal. However, any future litigation will likely revisit these proportional determinations.
*   The issue of the "family home" status was not addressed due to the jurisdictional issue, leaving open the potential for future disputes regarding its legal implications.

**Legal Advice:**

*   Advise clients filing partition suits to *always* explicitly allege the assessed value of the real property in the complaint.  If unavailable, attach documents from which it can be readily determined (e.g., tax declaration).
*   Be prepared to address issues of heirship and proportional shares if the case is re-filed in the proper court.
