## Legal Document Summary: People v. Hilario, G.R. No. 210610

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Marilou Hilario for illegal sale of dangerous drugs (Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165) but acquitting her and Lalaine Guadayo of illegal possession of dangerous drugs (Section 11, Article II, R.A. 9165). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately reversed the CA decision and acquitted Hilario.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Charges:** Hilario was charged with illegal sale (Crim. Case No. 10-2008) and illegal possession (Crim. Case No. 11-2008) of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu") under R.A. 9165. Guadayo was charged with illegal possession (Crim. Case No. 13-2008).
*   **RTC Decision:** Initially, the RTC convicted both Hilario and Guadayo of all charges. Hilario received life imprisonment and a fine for illegal sale, and 12 years and 1 day to 20 years for illegal possession. Guadayo received 12 years and 1 day to 20 years for illegal possession.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA affirmed Hilario's conviction for illegal sale but acquitted both Hilario and Guadayo for illegal possession. The CA reasoned that the possession was absorbed in the sale for Hilario, citing *People v. Posada* and *People v. Lacerna*.  Guadayo was acquitted due to a break in the chain of custody and failure to properly identify the shabu seized. *Malillin v. People* and *People v. Doria* are referenced on chain of custody.
*   **SC Decision:** The SC reversed the CA's affirmation of Hilario's conviction for illegal sale, acquitting her. The SC found that the prosecution failed to establish the elements of illegal sale beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly the identity and integrity of the *corpus delicti*. The SC criticized the lack of specific details in the buy-bust operation, citing *People v. Ong*, which emphasizes the need for detailed evidence to establish a valid entrapment and strict scrutiny of the buy-bust transaction.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution must prove all elements of illegal sale under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165: identity of buyer and seller, object of sale and consideration, delivery, and payment, as stated in *People v. Ismael*. Crucially, they must also establish the unbroken chain of custody to preserve the integrity of the evidence.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The core issue was the questionable chain of custody and the conflicting testimony regarding the markings on the seized drugs.  The SC highlighted the discrepancy in PO1 de Sagun's testimony (markings NBS-1 and NBS-2) and the lack of explanation for the presence of two sachets of shabu. PO2 Magpantay, who allegedly seized the drugs from Guadayo, did not testify, creating a hearsay problem.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The SC found PO1 de Sagun's testimony to be "generalizations which lacked material details, riddled with inconsistencies, and uncorroborated." The buy-bust operation lacked specific details about the initial contact, surveillance, and the pre-arranged signal.
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** The SC emphasized that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement cannot outweigh the presumption of innocence, citing *Mallillin v. People*.
*   **Target Selection:** The SC questioned how the police officers identified Hilario as the seller without prior surveillance or knowledge, raising concerns about potential entrapment.
*   **Conflicting Information on Sachet Numbers:** There were inconsistencies between the information presented at the trial, such as with 2 sachets, as well as what was in the formal documents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Section 5 (Illegal Sale) and Section 11 (Illegal Possession)
*   **People v. Posada:** (possession absorbed in sale)
*   **People v. Lacerna:** (possession absorbed in sale)
*   **Malillin v. People:** (corpus delicti, chain of custody)
*   **People v. Doria:** (corpus delicti, chain of custody)
*   **People v. Ong:** (buy-bust operations, entrapment)
*   **People v. Ismael:** (elements of illegal sale)
*   **Dungo v. People** (Appeal process and rules of court)
*   **People v. Godoy** (Disturbing conclusions of trial court on the credibility of witnesses.)
*   **People v. Balibay** (Identity and integrity of drug seized needs to be preserved)
*   **De la Riva v. People** (Presumption of innocence until proven guilty.)
*   **People v. Bagano** (The prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of evidence presented by the defense)
*   **People v. Pagaduan** (Regardless of how much we want to curb this menace, we cannot disregard the protection provided by the Constitution, most particularly the presumption of innocence bestowed on the appellant.)

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of meticulous adherence to chain of custody procedures and the need for detailed, credible testimony in drug-related prosecutions. The SC's decision emphasizes that the prosecution must overcome the presumption of innocence with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the presumption of regularity cannot substitute for concrete evidence establishing the elements of the crime.
