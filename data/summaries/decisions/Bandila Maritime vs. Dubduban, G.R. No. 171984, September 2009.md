**Document Type:** Resolution, Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Bandila Maritime Services, Inc. and Tokomaru Kaiun Co., Ltd. (Employer/Manning Agency)
*   **Respondent:** Rolando Dubduban (Seafarer/Employee)

**Key Issue:** Entitlement to disability benefits under the 1996 POEA Standard Contract of Employment for Seafarers.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals decision and reinstating the NLRC's dismissal of Dubduban's claim.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 20(B) of the 1996 POEA Standard Contract:**  Disability benefits are payable for work-related injury or illness suffered during the contract term.
*   **Section 20(B)(3) of the 1996 POEA Standard Contract:** Obligation of the seafarer to submit to a company-designated physician for medical examination within three (3) days of arrival in the Philippines, failing which bars a claim for disability benefits.
*    **Section 32-A of the 1996 POEA Standard Contract:** List of compensable occupational diseases.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioners' (Employers') Risk (Mitigated by Ruling):**  Potential liability for disability benefits (US $20,150) and medical expenses. This risk was extinguished by the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Respondent's (Seafarer's) Risk:** Loss of disability benefits claim.

**Reasoning & Key Facts:**

1.  **Pre-Existing Condition:** Dubduban had been diagnosed with diabetes in 1994, *before* his employment with Petitioners.
2.  **Lack of Complaint During Employment:** He did not complain of diabetic symptoms during his employment.
3.  **Failure to Comply with 3-Day Rule:**  He failed to submit to a company-designated physician within three days of his arrival in the Philippines.
4.  **Diabetes Not Listed:** Diabetes is not listed as a compensable occupational disease under Section 32-A of the POEA Contract.

**Statutory References:**

*   1996 POEA Standard Contract of Employment for Seafarers (Sections 20(B), 20(B)(3), and 32-A)
*   Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Certiorari in CA)

**Case Law:**

*   *Maunlad Transport Inc. v. Manigo, Jr., G.R. No. 161416, 13 June 2008, 554 SCRA 446* (Cited by the Supreme Court regarding the 3-day rule).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA argued that Dubduban's work as a chief cook aggravated his pre-existing diabetic condition, however, the Supreme Court disagreed.

**Legal Analysis & Potential Arguments:**

*   The Supreme Court focused on the pre-existing nature of the diabetes and the seafarer's failure to comply with the mandatory post-employment medical examination. This aligns with established jurisprudence requiring strict compliance with the POEA contract's requirements for disability claims.
*   The respondent's argument that his work aggravated his condition was rejected due to the lack of evidence that he complained of any complications during his employment.
* The CA decision hinged on the argument that his exposure to food tasting as a cook aggravated his condition. This was effectively overturned by the SC by giving weight to the POEA guidelines.

**Conclusion:**

The decision highlights the importance of timely compliance with the POEA contract's requirements for disability claims and reinforces the principle that employers are not liable for pre-existing conditions that are not demonstrably aggravated by the employment. It emphasizes the seafarer's burden of proof in establishing work-relatedness and compliance with procedural rules.
