**Legal Document Summary: _Reyman G. Minsola v. New City Builders, Inc. and Engr. Ernel Fajardo_ (G.R. No. 207613, January 31, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an illegal dismissal case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the petitioner, Minsola, was a project employee or a regular employee, and whether he was illegally dismissed.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that Minsola was a project employee but was entitled to certain monetary claims. The Court of Appeals (CA) decision was modified.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Project Employment:** SC affirmed Minsola's status as a project employee based on two criteria: (1) He was hired for a specific project or undertaking (Avida Tower 3, structural and architectural phases), and (2) he was notified of the duration and scope of the project at the time of engagement.
*   **No Constructive Dismissal:** SC found no evidence that Minsola was constructively dismissed. He was not prevented from working, nor was he demoted or discriminated against.  His refusal to sign the employment contract and subsequent absence constituted abandonment.
*   **Monetary Claims:** Despite being a project employee, Minsola was entitled to:
    *   **Salary Differentials:** Based on evidence that the daily wage of Php 260.00 was below the mandated minimum wage (Php 382.00) per Wage Order No. NCR-15.  Burden of proof is on the *employer* to show proper payment (Citing Loon, et al. v. Power Master, Inc., et al.).
    *   **13th Month Pay Differential:** As originally awarded by the LA.
    *   **Service Incentive Leave Pay Differentials.**
    *   **Holiday Pay:** Based on failure of the employer to prove payment.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded due to the unlawful withholding of wages (Article 111, Labor Code).
*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof for claims such as salary differential, service incentive leave, holiday pay, and 13th month pay rests on the employer to prove payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **New City Builders, Inc.:** Liable for unpaid salary differentials, service incentive leave pay differentials, holiday pay, 13th-month pay differentials and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of "Project":** The line between project employment and regular employment can be blurry, particularly in industries where project-based work is the norm. The employer must diligently document the project-specific nature of the employment (duration, scope, etc.).
*   **Minimum Wage Compliance:** Strict adherence to minimum wage laws is critical. Lack of proper record-keeping will shift the burden to the employer to prove compliance.
*   **Constructive Dismissal Claims:** Employers must be careful in handling employees perceived as problematic, as actions (even without overt termination) could be construed as constructive dismissal if they render continued employment "impossible, unreasonable or unlikely" (Verdadero v. Barney Autolines).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294 (formerly Article 280) of the Labor Code:**  Distinguishes regular from project-based employment.
*   **William Uy Construction Corp. v. Trinidad:** Discusses the unique characteristics of the construction industry and its effect on regular employment claims.  Emphasizes that length of service alone is insufficient to determine regular employment status.
*   **Loon, et al. v. Power Master, Inc., et al.:** Establishes the burden of proof regarding payment of monetary claims.
*   **Wage Order No. NCR-15:** Establishes minimum wage rates for the relevant period.
*   **Article 111 of the Labor Code:** Regarding attorney's fees in cases of unlawfully withheld wages.
*   **Verdadero v. Barney Autolines Group of Companies Transport, Inc.:** Defines "constructive dismissal."
*   **Gadia v. Sykes Asia, Inc:** Defines "projects" for project employee purposes.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document doesn't specify the method of calculation for the attorney's fees. A clear calculation process would benefit both sides.
