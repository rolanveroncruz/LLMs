## Legal Document Summary - *Chan vs. Court of Appeals & Teoville Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 118516, November 18, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) regarding a Decision of the Court of Appeals affirming with modification the Decisions of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in two consolidated cases:  *Teoville Development Corporation v. Henry Munar Chan, et al.* (Quieting of Title) and *Philippine Machinery Parts Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. Teoville Development Corporation* (Quieting of Title).

**Key Issue:** Conflicting claims of ownership over parcels of land in Muntinlupa, Rizal, involving overlapping Transfer Certificates of Title.  The core dispute revolves around the validity and priority of Teoville's titles (derived from OCT No. 2553, allegedly dating back to 1919 and El Colegio de San Jose) versus petitioners' titles (derived from decrees of registration issued in 1974).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding Teoville Development Corporation's superior right to the properties.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Double Registration:** The Court explicitly classifies the situation as a case of double registration. Applying established jurisprudence (*Margolles v. Court of Appeals, et al.*), the prior registration prevails. Teoville's title, derived from an earlier registration, takes precedence over the petitioners' later registered titles.
*   **Validity of Teoville's Title:** The Court addressed and rejected petitioners' attacks on the authenticity and validity of Teoville's title, particularly the xerox copy of OCT No. 2553. The Court finds that the Xerox copy of OCT No. 2553 is admissible in the absence of original copy. 
*   **Attack on Judge Valenzuela's Ruling:** The Court dismisses attacks on the credibility of the judge who presided over the initial case (Judge Valenzuela), noting that findings of fact from trial courts are given great weight.
*   **Correction of Decree Number:** The Court affirms the validity of the Order correcting the decree number on Teoville's titles (from 76377 to 76477) issued by Judge Bautista. The Court finds the notice requirement in Section 112 of Act 496 to be substantially complied with by notifying only the Register of Deeds given the circumstances of the case.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are ordered to respect Teoville's ownership of the land.
*   The decrees of registration (N-150479 to N-150484) underlying petitioners' titles are declared null and void.
*   Judgment of the Court of Appeals, dated November 29, 1994, is AFFIRMED in toto, without any pronouncement as to costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Xerox Copy:** The Court's acceptance of a xerox copy of OCT No. 2553, especially given petitioners' challenge to its authenticity, could be a point of contention.
*   **Substantial Compliance of Section 112, Act 496 (notice requirement):**The petitioners questioned that the Order dated December 5, 1979 of Judge Pedro JL. Bautista of Branch 3, Court of First Instance of Rizal (Pasay City) in CFI Land Case No. 1601-P, LRC (G.L.R.O.) No. 10766, Case No. 34, should be null and void. The petitioners point out that the respondent corporation offered no evidence to demonstrate or explain the alleged error in the copying of the decree number in respondent corporationâ€™s certificates of title. They theorize further that there was a jurisdictional defect vitiating the proceedings before the trial court because only the Register of Deeds for Pasig was notified of the Petition for Correction of Titles and subject petition was not presented in the original case in which the decree of registration was entered, contrary to what Section 112 of Act No. 496 prescribes. However, the Court finds that the notice requirement in Section 112 of Act 496 to be substantially complied with by notifying only the Register of Deeds given the circumstances of the case.
*   **Impact on Subsequent Transferees:** While the decision directly impacts the named petitioners, its effect on individuals and entities who acquired titles derived from the petitioners' invalidated decrees needs to be considered.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** Specifically Section 38 (as it relates to collateral attacks on decrees of registration) and Section 112 (regarding alterations/amendments to registration books).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Specifically Section 108 (formerly Section 112 of Act No. 496).
