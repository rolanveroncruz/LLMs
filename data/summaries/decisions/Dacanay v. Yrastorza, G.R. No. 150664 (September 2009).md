## Legal Document Summary: *Dacanay v. Yrastorza*

**Case:** *Dacanay v. Yrastorza*, G.R. No. 150664, September 3, 2009.

**Nature:** Resolution denying a petition for certiorari seeking to overturn a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order granting a motion for execution of a final and executory judgment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** The RTC decision dismissing the petitioner's (Dacanay, administrator of the estate of Tereso D. Fernandez) complaint for recovery of real property and ordering him to pay P70,000 to respondent spouses Samaco and respondent Mercader became final and executory.
*   **Personal Liability:** The RTC held Dacanay personally liable for the P70,000 award, not as a claim against the estate. This is the contentious issue.
*   **Motion for Execution:** Respondent Mercader filed a motion for execution of the RTC decision, which the RTC granted.
*   **Doctrine of Finality of Judgment:** The Supreme Court (SC) reiterated that a final and executory judgment is immutable and unalterable, citing *Ram's Studio and Photographic Equipment, Inc. v. CA*, G.R. No. 134888, 1 December 2000, 346 SCRA 691.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner Dacanay:** Personally liable for the P70,000 judgment, consisting of attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and moral damages awarded by the RTC to the respondents.
*   **Testate Estate of Tereso D. Fernandez:** Not directly liable, as the RTC decision did not constitute a money claim against the estate.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Execution of Judgment Against Dacanay's Personal Assets:** Dacanay faces the risk of his personal assets being seized and sold to satisfy the judgment.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Dacanay's direct filing of the petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, potentially leading to immediate dismissal. He also had defects on filing motion of extension leading to denail by supreme court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Used as the basis for Dacanay's petition for certiorari.
*   **Rule 13, Sections 4 & 11, Rules of Court:** Cited regarding service of motions and non-personal filing requirements.
*   **Rule 45, Sections 2 & 3, Rules of Court:** Cited regarding filing petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts Doctrine:** Violated by Dacanay's direct filing with the Supreme Court. *People v. Cuaresma, G.R. No. 67787, 18 April 1989, 172 SCRA 415, 423-424* is a relevant case.
*   **Doctrine of Finality of Judgment:** Emphasized by the SC. *Ram's Studio and Photographic Equipment, Inc. v. CA, G.R. No. 134888, 1 December 2000, 346 SCRA 691.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's decision that the judgment "did not involve money claims" is critical, although possibly erroneous. This classification prevented the claim from being considered against the estate, leading to Dacanay's personal liability.
*   The basis for the award of attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and moral damages against Dacanay *personally* is not fully explained, but its finality bars further contest.

**Conclusion:**

This case hinges on the finality of the RTC judgment and the procedural errors committed by Dacanay. The Supreme Court upheld the RTC decision due to the doctrine of finality of judgment and Dacanay's failure to comply with procedural requirements. The critical issue is the final and unappealable determination that Dacanay is personally liable, and that the judgment did not constitute a claim against the estate. There is now no recourse for Dacanay.
