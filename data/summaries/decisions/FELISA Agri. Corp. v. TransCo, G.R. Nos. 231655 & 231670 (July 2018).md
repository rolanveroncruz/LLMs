## Legal Document Summary: Felisa Agricultural Corporation v. National Transmission Corporation

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 231655 and 231670, July 2, 2018 (834 Phil. 861)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision nullifying RTC Orders that directed NPC to compensate Felisa Agricultural Corporation for land occupied by transmission towers.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Felisa Agricultural Corporation (FAC) sued National Power Corporation (NPC) (later substituted by National Transmission Corporation - TRANSCO) in 2001 for recovery of possession and just compensation for a 19,635 sq. m. portion of its land in Bacolod City occupied by NPC's transmission towers since 1985. NPC claimed a permit to enter was granted in 1989 and that FAC's claim was time-barred under the NPC Charter.
*   **Initial Issue:** Focused on just compensation. Parties initially agreed on P400/sq.m. but the deal failed due to OSG inaction. FAC then moved for initial payment of 100% zonal value (P7,845,000.00) based on RA 8974.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Granted FAC's motion, ordering NPC to pay P7,845,000.00 as initial payment, citing RA 8974.
*   **CA Ruling (Overturned):** Initially reversed the RTC, stating RA 8974 only applies to expropriation proceedings, and this was a recovery of possession case. Amended the decision stating that since the taking occurred in 1985, prior to RA 8974, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court should govern. Remanded to RTC for determination of just compensation based on value at the time of taking.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** GRANTED the petition, reinstated RTC Orders, and REMANDED the case to the RTC for the determination of just compensation applying RA 8974 guidelines. The initial compensation was also recomputed to P7,854,000.00. The SC emphasized the State's obligation to initiate eminent domain proceedings and ensure prompt just compensation, also legal interest shall be imposed on the unpaid balance at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the time of taking, i.e., from entry in the subject land on September 21, 1989, until June 30, 2013; thereafter, or beginning July 1, 2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due petitioner shall earn interest at the rate six percent (6%) per annum.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **National Transmission Corporation (TRANSCO):** Obligated to pay Felisa Agricultural Corporation just compensation for the land taken for public use, including the provisional value (P7,854,000.00) and legal interest on any unpaid balance.
*   **State:** Has the obligation to initiate eminent domain proceedings when taking private property for public use.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Determination of Just Compensation:** Significant risk in determining the *final* just compensation. This is often contentious and requires expert valuation and evidence. The RTC is bound to consider standards under RA 8974.
*   **Time of Taking:** While the court asserts the general rule of value at the time of taking, determining the specific date when "taking" occurred, and if it was physical taking or constructive taking could be a point of contention.
*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** Discrepancies in FMV and assessed value can lead to disagreements during the valuation process.
*   **RA 8974 Implementation:** Deviation from RA 8974 guidelines possible if justified, but requires clear explanation from the court (see *Republic v. Ng*).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Judge Gingoyon:** Establishes RA 8974 supersedes the deposit system under Rule 67 in national government infrastructure projects.
*   **Republic v. Hon. Tagle:** Clarifies that physical entry and occupation do not equal expropriation; a writ of possession is still needed.
*   **Alfonso v. Pasay City:** Highlights the Court's disapproval of the government's practice of taking property without proper expropriation.
*   **Republic v. Lara:** states the general rule for determining the value when the property is taken ahead of the filing of the condemnation proceedings.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8974 (repealed by RA 10752 but principles remained):** Focuses on facilitating acquisition of right-of-way for national government infrastructure projects by expediting payment of just compensation. Specifically, the payment of 100% of zonal value as provisional compensation.
*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code):** Defines "assessed value" (Section 199(h)).
*   **Rule 67, Rules of Court:** Governs expropriation proceedings (procedural aspects).
*   **RA 9136 (Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001):** Establishes TRANSCO and its substitution for NPC.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the law.
*   The valuation of the land.
