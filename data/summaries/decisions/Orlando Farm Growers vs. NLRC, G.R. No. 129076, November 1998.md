**Case Summary: *Orlando Farm Growers Association v. NLRC***

**Core Issue:** Determination of employer-employee relationship between an unregistered association and farm workers, and the legality of their dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court upheld the NLRC's finding that an employer-employee relationship existed based on the four-fold test: (1) selection and engagement; (2) payment of wages; (3) power of dismissal; and (4) power of control (citing *Filipinas Broadcasting Network v. NLRC*).  The *power of control* was deemed the most important factor.
*   **Unregistered Association as Employer:** The Court held that an unregistered association can be considered an employer under Article 212(e) of the Labor Code, which defines an employer as "any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or indirectly."  Registration is not a prerequisite.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The employer failed to prove just cause for termination, or to comply with the two-notice rule (citing *Brahm Industries, Inc. v. NLRC*, and *Padilla v. NLRC*) requiring written notice of cause and opportunity to be heard.  This constitutes illegal dismissal.
*   **Remedies:** Illegally dismissed employees are entitled to full backwages from the date of dismissal until reinstatement (citing *Bustamante v. NLRC*). The Labor Arbiter's limitation of backwages to 3 years was deemed erroneous. Moral damages and attorney's fees were deleted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Orlando Farm Growers Association/Glicerio Anover is liable for illegally dismissing employees.
*   The Association is jointly and solidarily liable for backwages and other benefits.
*   The Association must reinstate the illegally dismissed employees.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Specificity of Award:** The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Labor Arbiter to specify individual amounts due to each employee.  This suggests the initial award was not sufficiently itemized and could lead to further disputes during execution.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** The finding of joint and solidary liability means the individual officers of the Association could be held personally liable if the Association's assets are insufficient.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The association might try to argue that it did not exercise control over the complainants.
*   **Future Compliance:** Association should have protocol in place to handle disciplinary matters.
*   **Stanfilco Relationship**: The association's interaction with Stanfilco as an employer, not just a unified front for landowners, creates complexities in assessing control and potential liability.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 212(e) of the Labor Code (definition of employer)
*   Article 282 of the Labor Code (just causes for termination)
