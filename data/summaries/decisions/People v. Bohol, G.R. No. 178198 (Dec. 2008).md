**Case Summary: People v. Bohol, G.R. No. 178198, December 10, 2008**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Evelyn Bohol for murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Evelyn Bohol found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.
*   **Conspiracy:** Court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy between Bohol, Arnold Adoray, Alexander Dagami, and Robin Butas to kill Steven Alston Davis.
*   **Treachery:**  Killing qualified as murder due to treachery. The victim was shot while asleep, ensuring the execution without risk to the assailants.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil indemnity: P50,000.00 (mandatory, no proof needed other than the crime)
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00 (mandatory in murder/homicide cases, no proof needed other than death)
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.00 (awarded due to the qualifying circumstance of treachery)

**Obligations:**

*   Evelyn Bohol is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Evelyn Bohol is obligated to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the heirs of Steven Alston Davis.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for murder.
*   Civil liability to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Credibility of State Witness (Robin Butas):** Appellant challenges the credibility of Robin Butas, arguing his testimony was motivated by a desire to be exculpated.  The Court addresses this concern and the potential bias of a witness, and rules that it will be taken with caution, but finds it credible because it was corroborated by his wife.
*   **Lack of Motive:** Appellant argues the prosecution failed to establish her motive to kill the victim. The Supreme Court sidesteps this issue, instead focusing on the established conspiracy.
*   **Treachery:** Appellant contends that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not sufficiently proven. The Court ruled that it was, citing the evidence that Steven was killed while asleep, leaving him defenseless.
*   **Parricide vs. Murder:** The Court clarifies that the accused could not be charged of parricide in the information and therefore could only be charged with murder.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Article 246 (Parricide)
    *   Article 248 (Murder)
*   **Civil Code:** Article 2230 (Exemplary Damages)
*   **Conspiracy:** *People v. Barcenal* (GR No. 175925, August 17, 2007)
*   **Treachery:** *People v. Garin* (G.R. No. 139069, June 17, 2004)
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** *Siccuan v. People* (G.R. No. 133709, April 28, 2005) and *People v. Bocalan* (457 Phil. 472, 482 (2003))
*   **Alibi:** *People v. Flores* (466 Phil. 683, 692 (2004))

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None identified. The court's reasoning is generally clear.

**Key Takeaway:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Evelyn Bohol for murder based on conspiracy and treachery, despite challenges to the credibility of the state witness and the lack of explicitly proven motive. The Court found that treachery was proven when the evidence showed the victim was killed while asleep. Damages were awarded accordingly.
