**Legal Document Summary: People of the Philippines vs. Romeo Chan Reales (G.R. Nos. 258182 and 259950)**

**Nature:** Ordinary appeal assailing the Sandiganbayan's Decision and Resolution convicting Accused-Appellant Romeo Chan Reales of (1) violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and (2) Malversation through falsification of public documents under Article 217, in relation to Articles 48 and 171 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Accusation:** Reales, as OIC Provincial Administrator and Provincial Accountant of Samar, created and enrolled fictitious job order workers, misappropriating their wages (PHP 76,500). He approved payroll documents (Summaries of Payrolls, DTRs, Time Book & Payrolls) falsely certifying services rendered by the job order workers, which they did not render.
*   **Charges:** Violation of Section 3(e) RA 3019 (SB-17-CRM-2197) for causing undue injury to the government through evident bad faith, manifest partiality, and/or gross inexcusable negligence. Malversation through falsification of public documents (SB-17-CRM-2198) under Article 217, RPC, for misappropriating public funds by falsifying payroll documents.
*   **Sandiganbayan Decision:** Found Reales guilty on both charges, appreciating voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance.  Sentenced to imprisonment and perpetual disqualification from public office.

**Court's Ruling**
*   **Acquittal:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the appeal, REVERSING the Sandiganbayan's decision and ACQUITTING Reales of all charges due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** The Court determined that prosecution failed to prove elements of both crimes:
    *   **RA 3019 §3(e):** The prosecution failed to prove overt act; non-existence or non-rendition of service of job-order workers. This also failed to prove that Reales acted with "evident bad faith." Evident bad faith requires a showing of corrupt motive.
    *   **Malversation:** Prosecution failed to prove malversation under Article 217, RPC by direct evidence or the presumption that accused had put such funds to personal use because prosecution failed to meet requisite for application of presumption, that accused received demand for the funds and did not have them in his possession. The prosecution also failed to prove falsification through competent evidence.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The affidavits of Bardaje and Ordoña were deemed hearsay and inadmissible, lacking the opportunity for cross-examination.
*   **Conclusory Evidence:** Reales's signatures on the documents alone were insufficient to prove that he committed falsification to misappropriate public funds. His error was ruled as more likely judgmental error.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Burden did not shift to accused because the elements of the crimes were not established at the onset, which they must be by way of proven evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The prosecution's case relied heavily on inferences drawn from Reales's signatures on payroll documents and the absence of certain records, rather than direct evidence of misappropriation or falsification. The ruling highlights the risk of relying on circumstantial evidence without adequately proving the core elements of the alleged crimes.
*   **Burden of Proof on Negative Averments:** The decision reaffirms the prosecution's burden to prove negative averments (e.g., non-rendition of services) when they are essential elements of the crime. The *People v. Manalo* doctrine is discussed, and the court found the negative averment was not proven.
*   **Interpretation of "Evident Bad Faith":** The Court emphasized that "evident bad faith" under Section 3(e) requires demonstrating a corrupt motive, not merely errors in judgment. This provides a stricter interpretation that may be harder for prosecutors to meet in similar cases.
*   **Judicial interpretation of documentary exhibits:** Reales' signature on records was not enough to prove the employees did not exist, and court found no tampering of documents by Reales to indicate otherwise.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Section 3(e).
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 217 (Malversation), 48 (Complex Crimes), and 171 (Falsification by Public Officer).
*   **People v. Manalo, 300 Phil. 317 (1994):** Discusses the burden of proof in cases involving negative averments.
*   **People v. Pajenado, 142 Phil. 702 (1970):** Burden of proof for negative fact if it is essential ingredient of the offense charged.
*   **People v. Gil-Roflo, G.R. Nos. 249564 & 249568-76, March 21, 2022:** Case distinguished due to independent proof of the alleged ghost employees' rendition of service.
*   **Maamo v. People, G.R. No. 201917, 801 Phil. 627 (2016):** Case distinguished due to the municipal accountant and other witnesses confirming that projects existed.

**Conclusion:**

This decision highlights the importance of presenting concrete evidence to establish all elements of corruption and malversation charges. Prosecutors must diligently investigate and present evidence to support negative averments when they are critical to the case.
