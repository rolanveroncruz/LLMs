**Legal Document Summary: *Racion v. MST Marine Services Philippines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 219291**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dismissal of Petition:** The CA dismissed the petition for certiorari due to procedural errors.
*   **Non-Forum Shopping:** The certificate of non-forum shopping was signed by petitioner's counsel without proper authority (SPA) and without explanation for petitioner's inability to sign.  This is deemed a defective certification equivalent to non-compliance.
*   **Failure to State Addresses:** The petition failed to include the actual addresses of the petitioner and respondent Alfonso Ranjo Del Castillo, violating Rule 46, Section 3 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Strict Observance of Rules:** The Court emphasized that certiorari is an extraordinary remedy requiring strict adherence to procedural rules.  Liberal application of the rules requires justifiable cause for non-compliance, which the Petitioner failed to demonstrate beyond a claim of inadvertence.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to personally execute the certificate of non-forum shopping.
*   Petitioners must provide the full names and actual addresses of all parties in the petition.
*   Parties seeking certiorari must strictly observe procedural rules.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Dismissal of Petition:** Failure to comply with procedural requirements of Rule 65 (certiorari) and Rule 46 (contents and filing of petitions) can result in outright dismissal.
*   **Loss of Appeal:**  Rejection of liberal construction by appellate courts can mean loss of the opportunity for appellate review.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:**  Pertains to petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 46, Section 3, Rules of Court:**  Governs the contents and filing requirements of petitions, specifically regarding addresses and non-forum shopping certifications.
*   **Rule 65, Section 1, Rules of Court:**  Deals with the requisites and contents of a Petition for Certiorari
*   ***Vda. De Formoso v. Philippine National Bank*, 665 Phil. 184 (2011):** Established that certiorari requires strict adherence to rules.
*   ***Athena Computers, Inc. v. Reyes*, 559 Phil. 123 (2007):** Reiterates the Court's discretion in accepting certiorari petitions.
*   ***Suzuki v. de Guzman*, 528 Phil. 1033 (2006):** Held that counsel's signature on a certificate of non-forum shopping, without a proper SPA, is a fatal defect.
*   ***Cenda√±a v. Avila*, 567 Phil. 370 (2008):** Affirmed the mandatory nature of including actual addresses in petitions.
*   ***LGU of Municipality of Hinatuan, v. South Ironrock Corp., G.R. No. 237785, June 27, 2018*** Reiterates ruling in Altres vs Empleo on defective certification
*   ***Indoyon, Jr. v. Court of Appeals*, 706 Phil. 200 (2013):**  Reinforces the importance of following procedural rules and the court's authority to enforce them.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document's recitation of facts indicates uncertainty regarding the initial medical examination and diagnosis of the Petitioner upon repatriation.  This lack of clarity could have implications regarding the basis for the disability claim and the medical assessments presented to the Labor Arbiter and NLRC.
*   The petitioner's argument that the CA should have liberally construed the rules in his favor and only claiming that his failure to comply was due to inadvertence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The petitioner has exhausted his administrative and appellate remedies, as the Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the petition for certiorari. Further recourse would require compelling new evidence or a fundamental shift in legal interpretation.
*   The Petitioner's counsel is potentially exposed to a malpractice claim for failing to properly comply with procedural rules, especially concerning the certificate of non-forum shopping and the omission of required addresses.
