**Nature:** Resolution of the Supreme Court in a consolidated administrative case involving malversation of funds by a court employee and neglect of duty by a presiding judge.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) and Commission on Audit (COA)
*   **Respondent:** Efren F. Varela, Interpreter and Acting Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court (MTC) Catbalogan, Samar
*   **Respondent (Related):** Hon. Odelon S. Mabutin, Presiding Judge, MTC, Catbalogan Samar

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Efren Varela (Respondent):**
    *   Designated Acting Clerk of Court; obligated to properly manage court funds as custodian.
    *   Found to have incurred shortages totaling P1,032,826.59 in Judiciary Development Fund, General Fund, Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund, and Fiduciary Fund.
    *   Failed to remit funds to authorized depositories (LBP), instead depositing into a personal account (LBP Savings Account No. 0601-1271-80).
    *   Failed to submit required monthly reports.
    *   **Obligation to Restitute:** Ordered to restitute P240,084.10 representing the remaining balance of the shortages.
*   **Judge Odelon Mabutin (Respondent):**
    *   Presiding Judge responsible for supervising court personnel and ensuring proper fund management.
    *   Found to have known of Varela's personal account deposit practices but failed to immediately report it to the OCA.
    *   Failed to adequately monitor Varela's handling of court funds.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Efren Varela:**
    *   **Liability:** Found guilty of gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, grave misconduct, and malversation of public funds.
    *   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits (excluding accrued leave credits) and prejudice to re-employment in government service.
*   **Judge Odelon Mabutin:**
    *   **Liability:** Found guilty of simple neglect of duty.
    *   **Penalty:** Reprimand and stern warning.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Varela:**
    *   **Criminal Liability:** The Ombudsman filed a separate criminal case for Malversation of Public Funds in RTC Catbalogan, related to the missing P459,702.96. Plea bargaining may depend on full restitution.
    *   Difficulty in Restitution: Varela may be unable to fully restitute the remaining P240,084.10.

*   **Government:**
    *   Enforcement of Restitution: The government must actively pursue the recovery of the remaining P240,084.10.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Prima facie evidence of malversation:** Failure of a public officer to remit funds upon demand (Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted in the MTCC-OCC, Angeles City, A.M. No. P-06-2140, June 26, 2006, 492 SCRA 469, 481).
*   **Elements of Malversation:** Receipt of public funds/property, inability to account for them, absence of funds/property during audit, and lack of satisfactory explanation (Concerned Citizen v. Gabral, Jr., A.M. No. P-05-2098, December 15, 2005, 478 SCRA 13).
*   **Supreme Court Circulars:** SC Circulars Nos. 13-92 and 5-93 (proper administration of court funds)
*   **Administrative Liability:** Acts qualify as gross neglect of duty, grave misconduct (Office of the Court Administrator v. Dureza-Aldevera, A.M. No. P-01-1499, September 26, 2006, 503 SCRA 18).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge Mabutin's culpability:** While found guilty of simple neglect of duty, the extent of his liability is debatable, given his stated reliance on Varela and the lack of evidence of direct personal benefit.

**Orders:**

*   Varela's offer to use withheld salaries to address his shortage is accepted as a partial payment.
*   OIC of RTC ordered to withdraw and deposit the P459,702.96 to the MTC's Fiduciary account. The MTC cannot issue official receipt for this transfer.
*   Financial Management Office (FMO) to remit Varela's unpaid salaries to the MTC accounts based on the fund shortages.
*   Varela to restitute the Judiciary Development Funds and General Fund accounts.
*   Judge Mabutin is reprimanded.

**Overall Assessment:** The document reflects the Supreme Court's zero-tolerance policy towards corruption and financial mismanagement within the judiciary. The resolution clearly defines the liabilities of both the erring employee and the negligent supervisor, emphasizing the importance of accountability and proper handling of public funds.
