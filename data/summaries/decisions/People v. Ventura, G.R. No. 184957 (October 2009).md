**Case Summary: *People v. Ventura*, G.R. No. 184957 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for violation of Section 5 (sale of dangerous drugs), in relation to Section 26 (attempt or conspiracy), Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Section 5, R.A. 9165:** Prohibits and penalizes the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs. Penalty is life imprisonment to death and a fine of P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00. The quantity of the drug is not a factor in determining the penalty under this section.
*   **Section 26, R.A. 9165:** Penalizes the attempt or conspiracy to commit the acts prohibited under the Act with the same penalty as the completed act.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165:** Outlines the procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, including inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, or a representative, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.

**Factual Background:** Accused-appellant Grace Ventura was convicted of selling 0.124 gram of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) during a buy-bust operation. The prosecution presented testimonies of police officers involved in the operation. The defense argued frame-up and challenged the chain of custody of the evidence.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Legal Issues and Reasoning:**
*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense argued a break in the chain of custody. The Court held that the prosecution adequately established the chain of custody from seizure to laboratory examination. The Court noted that while there were some lapses in procedure, the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item was preserved. The marking of the evidence with initials and the positive laboratory results were key to determining the integrity of the seized item. The Court also noted that failure to strictly follow the procedures in Section 21 is not fatal as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court invoked the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by the police officers, which was not overcome by clear and convincing evidence of improper motive or irregular conduct.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court found the testimonies of the police officers credible and sufficient to establish the elements of illegal sale of drugs: identification of buyer and seller, the object (shabu), the consideration (marked money), and the delivery of the drug and payment. The testimonies of the police officers were also supported by documentary evidence, including the request for laboratory examination, the chemistry report, and the marked money.
*   **Defense of Denial and Frame-Up:** The Court rejected the defense's claims of denial and frame-up, finding them easily concocted and unsubstantiated.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   Accused-appellant Grace Ventura is obligated to serve a sentence of life imprisonment and pay a fine of P500,000.00 for violation of Section 5 in relation to Section 26, Article II of R.A. 9165.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   The decision highlights the Court's reliance on the presumption of regularity, which can be difficult to overcome even with potential procedural lapses in the handling of evidence.
*   While the Court emphasizes the importance of preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items, the decision suggests that strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is not always required.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
