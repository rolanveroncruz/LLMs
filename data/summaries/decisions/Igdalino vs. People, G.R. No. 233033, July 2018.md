## Legal Document Summary: *Igdalino v. People*, G.R. No. 233033 (2018)

**Case:** *Romeo Igdalino and Rosita Igdalino v. People of the Philippines*

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Qualified Theft under Art. 310 in relation to Art. 308 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 308 RPC (Theft):** Defines theft as the taking of personal property of another with intent to gain, without consent, and without violence or force.
*   **Art. 310 RPC (Qualified Theft):** Elevates theft to qualified theft when specific aggravating circumstances are present, including taking coconuts from a plantation.
*   Elements of Theft: (1) Taking of personal property, (2) Property belongs to another, (3) Taking without owner's consent, (4) Intent to gain (animus furandi), (5) Taking without violence/force.

**Facts:** The Igdalinos were accused of qualified theft for harvesting 2,500 coconuts from Avertino Jaboli's plantation. Prosecution presented TCT in the name of Francisco Jaboli (Avertino's father) as evidence of ownership. The defense argued ownership based on OCT in the name of Rosita's father, Narciso Gabejan, and open and notorious cultivation/harvesting.

**Lower Court Decisions:**

*   **RTC:** Convicted Igdalinos of qualified theft, sentenced imprisonment, and ordered payment of actual and moral damages.
*   **CA:** Affirmed conviction but deleted moral damages.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the CA decision and **acquitted** the Igdalinos.
*   **Reasoning:** Prosecution failed to prove "animus furandi" (intent to steal) beyond reasonable doubt. The Igdalinos acted under a *bona fide* belief of ownership, supported by OCT No. 1068 in Narciso's name.
*   **Key Finding:** Open and notorious harvesting since Narciso's time, coupled with OCT, negates intent to steal. Knowledge of Avertino's win in the civil case for quieting of title occurred *after* the complained-of harvest, and no evidence demonstrated the civil court's rendering a final decision in Avertino's favor at the time of the coconut harvesting by the Igdalinos.
*   Cited *Gaviola v. People* (516 Phil. 228 (2006)) establishing precedent.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Ownership:** Reliance on an OCT versus a TCT could have been contentious.
*   **Hearsay:** Accusation that Felicisimo Bacarra's testimony was hearsay, but the Court only mentions it to refute the argument that Avertino failed to establish his ownership.
*   **Intent to Gain:** The core issue revolved around proving the intent to gain.
*   **Impact of Civil Case:** The timing of the Igdalinos' awareness of the civil case outcome was crucial to rebutting "animus furandi."

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 308, Revised Penal Code (Theft)**
*   **Article 310, Revised Penal Code (Qualified Theft)**
*   **Gaviola v. People, 516 Phil. 228 (2006):** Defines the elements of intent to gain and discusses good faith belief in ownership.
*   **Black v. State:** Establishes that open and notorious taking without concealment raises a presumption against animus furandi.
*   **Charles v. State:** Holds that the belief of ownership must be honest and in good faith.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Since the accused were acquitted, there are no associated obligations or liabilities. However, the State could potentially be liable for damages due to wrongful prosecution if the Igdalinos were to pursue such a claim.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact nature and standing of the civil case for quieting of title are not fully detailed, making it difficult to assess its full impact on the criminal case.
*   The exact role of Rowel Igdalino in the commission of the alleged crime.
