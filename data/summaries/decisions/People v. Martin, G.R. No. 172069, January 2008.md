## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Martin*, G.R. No. 172069

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Mario S. Martin*

**Citation:** 567 Phil. 138 (2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Mario S. Martin for qualified rape under Article 335 in relation to Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353, committed against his mentally retarded minor daughter, AAA.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Qualified Rape (Art. 335, RPC in relation to Art. 266-A(1)(d) and Art. 266-B(1), RPC as amended by RA 8353)
*   **Victim:** AAA, 10-year-old mentally retarded (Down Syndrome, IQ 41.8).
*   **Accused:** Mario S. Martin (Father of the victim)
*   **Facts:** Accused had carnal knowledge of AAA on multiple occasions. AAA testified and identified the accused. Medical examination revealed a healed hymenal laceration indicating non-virginity.
*   **Ruling:** Guilt proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court affirmed the CA, which affirmed the RTC.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Penalty:**  Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole (due to RA 9346, prohibiting the death penalty, which was originally imposed by the RTC).
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: PHP 75,000
    *   Moral Damages: PHP 75,000
    *   Exemplary Damages: PHP 25,000
    *   Costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The defense argued the inadmissibility of the victim's and mother's sworn statements, birth certificate, marriage contract, and psychological report as hearsay. This argument was dismissed because AAA testified, the authenticity of documents were testified to, and the existence of the documents was admitted during the trial.  The failure to object on hearsay grounds at trial constituted a waiver. See *Cabugao v. People*
*   **Credibility of Victim Testimony:** Challenges to the victim's testimony were based on her mental retardation and potential for ambiguity. The court, however, considered her testimony credible due to its coherence given her limitations and emphasized the weight given to the testimony of child victims in rape cases. This aligns with established jurisprudence regarding the sufficiency of a rape victim's testimony if credible, as noted in *People v. Bulaybulay*.
*   **Medico-Legal Evidence:** The defense attempted to discredit the medico-legal report by noting that the doctor only testified that the laceration could have been caused by a hard blunt object. The court correctly inferred that an erect penis could be considered a hard blunt object in the context of the victim's testimony.
*   **Lack of Specific Proof on 4 out of 5 alleged counts:** Trial Court only found him guilty of one count since the prosecution failed to prove the other four counts.

**Analysis:**

The case hinges on the credibility of the victim's testimony, considering her mental state.  The court gives significant weight to the trial court's assessment of her demeanor and the consistency of her statements.  The defense arguments regarding hearsay and lack of direct medical confirmation of penile penetration are weak, given the victim's testimony and the existing legal precedents. The successful prosecution highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable victims and the court's willingness to rely on their testimony even with limitations, provided it is credible and supported by corroborating evidence.
