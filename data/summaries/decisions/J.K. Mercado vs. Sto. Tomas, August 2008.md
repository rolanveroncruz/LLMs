## Legal Document Summary: J.K. Mercado & Sons Agricultural Enterprises, Inc. v. Sto. Tomas (G.R. No. 158084)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Core Issue:** Whether the 3-year prescriptive period under Article 291 of the Labor Code applies to the enforcement of a final and executory Wage Order granting Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), or whether the 5-year prescriptive period for executing judgments applies.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Wage Order RTWPB-XI-03:** Granted COLA to covered workers in Region XI.
*   **Petitioner's Application for Exemption:** Denied by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) on April 11, 1994. This denial became final and executory as no appeal was filed.
*   **Private Respondents' Motion for Writ of Execution:** Filed on July 10, 1998, seeking enforcement of the Wage Order.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Claimed that private respondents' right to claim COLA had prescribed under Article 291 of the Labor Code (3-year prescriptive period for money claims).
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the denial of the Motion to Quash the Writ of Execution, holding that Article 291 does not apply because the enforcement action sought to execute a final order (the denial of the exemption application), not to initially establish a money claim. The Court ruled that the 5 year prescriptive period for executing judgments applied.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals. Art. 291 applies to the **initial filing of money claims**. Once a money claim is reduced to a final and executory judgment (the Wage Order), the **5-year prescriptive period** for execution of judgments applies. The Court emphasized the principle that specific provisions (execution of judgments) prevail over general provisions (money claims).
*   **Statutory References:**
    *   **Article 291, Labor Code:** 3-year prescriptive period for filing money claims.
    *   **Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court:** (referred to by petitioner) Addresses execution of judgments.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **J.K. Mercado & Sons:** Obligated to pay covered workers the COLA prescribed under Wage Order RTWPB-XI-03, plus 1% monthly interest, retroactive to December 1, 1993.
*   **J.K. Mercado & Sons:** Liable for non-compliance with the Wage Order.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Enforcement Actions:** Continued failure to comply with the Wage Order could lead to further enforcement actions, including garnishment of assets.
*   **Accruing Interest:** The 1% monthly interest continues to accrue on the unpaid COLA.

**Case Law & Legal Principles:**

*   The Supreme Court's decision underscores the principle that once a money claim is reduced to judgment, the rules governing the execution of judgments apply, including the 5-year prescriptive period.
*   The decision reaffirms the principle that specific legal provisions prevail over general ones.
*   The Court reinforced the principle that labor laws are construed in favor of labor.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not explicitly ambiguous, the petitioner argued for a broad interpretation of "money claims" under Article 291 to encompass enforcement actions. The Court rejected this interpretation.
