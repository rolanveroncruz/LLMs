## Legal Document Summary: *Magsaysay Maritime Corp. v. Velasquez*

**Case:** *Magsaysay Maritime Corp. and/or Conrado N. Dela Cruz and ODF Jell ASA v. Jaime M. Velasquez*, G.R. No. 179802, November 14, 2008.

**Subject Matter:** Disability benefits claim of a seafarer.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Velasquez (Respondent) was employed by Magsaysay Maritime Corp. (Petitioner) for a considerable period on multiple contracts as a second cook.
*   **Illness:** Respondent fell ill (Staphylococcal bacteremia, multiple metastatic abcesses, pleural effusion and hypertension) while on duty, was hospitalized in Singapore, and repatriated.
*   **Medical Assessment Dispute:** Upon repatriation, the company-designated physician (Dr. Alegre) eventually cleared Respondent as fit to work. Respondent consulted his own physician (Dr. Vicaldo) who declared him permanently disabled (Grade 1, 120%).
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** NLRC favored the company-designated physician's assessment, finding Respondent's testimony regarding lack of medical treatment untruthful and relying on *Sec. 20 (b), No. 2, paragraph 2 of the POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC)* regarding the competence of the company doctor. CA reversed, favoring Respondent's physician citing bias and inability to perform previous work.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**  SC *reversed* the CA decision and reinstated the NLRC's ruling, upholding the primacy of the company-designated physician's assessment per *Sec. 20 B.3 of the POEA Contract* unless the seafarer avails of a third doctor as provided in the contract which the seafarer did not avail.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** The employer has an obligation to provide medical treatment and compensation to the seafarer for illness/injury sustained during employment, per the *POEA SEC*.
*   **Employee:** The seafarer is obligated to submit to examination by the company-designated physician. *Failure to do so can result in forfeiture of benefits*. If the seafarer disagrees with the company physician, he/she must avail of the procedure to consult a third doctor.

**Liabilities:**

*   The employer is liable for disability benefits if the seafarer is deemed permanently disabled by the *company-designated physician or the third doctor*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** Creates potential for legal challenges. Strict adherence to POEA SEC protocol is crucial.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Seafarer carries the burden of proof to overcome the company-designated physician's assessment.
*   **Ambiguity in "Fit to Work":** The term "fit to work" could be ambiguous. The SC's decision emphasizes a medical determination of fitness, rather than the *seafarer's perceived earning capacity*.
*   **Failure to Avail of Third Doctor:** The failure to follow *Sec. 20-B, paragraph 3 of the POEA Contract* prejudiced seafarer's claim as it left the credibility of both opinions at the discretion of the NLRC who ruled in favor of the company doctor's opinion

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC):**  *Sec. 20 (b), No. 2, paragraph 2* and *Sec. 20 B.3.* are central to the decision.
*   **Executive Order No. 247:** Mandates the POEA to secure the best terms for Filipino contract workers.
*   **New Civil Code, Art. 1700:**  Labor contracts are subject to special labor laws.
*   **German Marine Agencies v. NLRC, 403 Phil. 572 (2001):**  Reiterates the primacy of the company-designated physician.
*   **Benjamin L. Sarocam v. Interorient Maritime Ent., Inc., G.R. No. 167813, June 27, 2006:** Affirms upholding the opinion of the company physician over seafarer-appointed doctors.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of "fit to work" remains a potential area of contention. While this case favors the medical assessment, arguments concerning loss of earning capacity can still be made.
