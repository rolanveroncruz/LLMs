Here's a legal summary of the provided *Cunanan v. Jumping Jap Trading Corporation* decision:

**Case:** *Isabelita Cunanan, et al. v. Jumping Jap Trading Corporation*, G.R. No. 173834 (2009)

**Subject Matter:** Validity of Real Estate Mortgage given the pending litigation (Lis Pendens) and extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Cunanans (mortgagees) are bound by the notice of lis pendens affecting the mortgaged property, rendering their mortgage and subsequent foreclosure invalid. Are they mortgagees in good faith?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that the Cunanans were mortgagees in bad faith and bound by the lis pendens.  Their mortgage and the subsequent foreclosure were deemed invalid.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Lis Pendens:** The court reiterates that a notice of lis pendens provides constructive notice to the world that the property is subject to litigation. Anyone acquiring an interest in the property does so at their own risk, gambling on the outcome of the suit. (Sec. 77, P.D. No. 1529). A purchaser or encumbrancer is deemed to have constructive notice of the pendency of the action, and only of its pendency against the parties designated by their real names (1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 13, Sec. 14)
*   **Timing of Mortgage:** Critical to the decision is the sequence of events. The Cunanans executed the mortgage *while* the notice of lis pendens was annotated on the title. Although there was a brief cancellation of the lis pendens, the Cunanans had executed the mortgage *prior* to the official cancellation. This is a legally significant gamble.
*   **Bad Faith:** The court held that even if the mortgage was executed after the initial cancellation of the lis pendens, the Cunanans had *actual knowledge* of the pending litigation involving the property. The orders dismissing the initial case and cancelling the lis pendens were not yet final and executory, and a motion for reconsideration was pending.
*   **Duty to Inquire:** Even if the Cunanans relied on the face of the title, the court held that this principle doesn't apply when the party has *actual knowledge* of facts that would impel a reasonably cautious person to make further inquiry into the status of the title, or has knowledge of defects or lack of title.
*   **"Mortgagee in Bad Faith" Consequence:** Because the Cunanans knew of the pending dispute, they are deemed mortgagees in bad faith. Therefore, their mortgage is invalid and the foreclosure proceedings are void.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Discusses the effect of a notice of lis pendens.
*   **Sandoval v. Court of Appeals; Leung Yee vs. F.L. Strong Machinery Co.:** Discusses the good faith of a purchaser/mortgagee.
*   **Po Lam v. Court of Appeals:** Distinguishes this case, as the Cunanans had actual knowledge of pending litigation while the spouses in Po Lam did not.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Investment:** The Cunanans stand to lose their entire investment in the loan, as the mortgage is invalid and the foreclosure is void.
*   **Liability for Damages:** Although not explicitly addressed in this decision, the potential exists for the Cunanans to be liable for damages to Jumping Jap Trading Corporation if the actions of the Cunanans caused further harm.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The Cunanans could argue that there was a period (even a very brief one) after the cancellation of the Lis Pendens and the time it was reinstated that they acted in good faith. However, that argument is not present here.**

**Recommendations:**

The decision clearly favors the Plaintiff.
