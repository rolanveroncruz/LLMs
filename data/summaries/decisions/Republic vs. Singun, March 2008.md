## Legal Document Summary - *Republic vs. Singun*

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Winston T. Singun* (G.R. No. 149356, March 14, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolutions regarding the inoperativeness of a resignation.

**Key Issue:** Validity of respondent Singun's resignation from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision, finding Singun's resignation to be incomplete and inoperative.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Resignation Requirements:** The Court reiterated the requirements for a valid resignation of a public officer: (a) intention to relinquish; (b) act of relinquishment; and (c) acceptance by the proper authority.
*   **Notification of Acceptance:** The "final or conclusive act of a resignation's acceptance is the notice of acceptance." The incumbent official must be duly notified.
*   **Withdrawal of Resignation:** A resignation can be validly withdrawn before its acceptance. *Joson III v. Nario, G.R. No. 91548, 13 July 1990, 187 SCRA 453*

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Payment of Salaries and Benefits:** The government is obligated to pay Singun's salaries and benefits from January 1, 2000, as his resignation was deemed inoperative.
*   **Abandonment of Office (Art. 238, Revised Penal Code):** The Court noted the penalties for abandoning office *before* acceptance of resignation. While abandonment was alleged (due to employment with PRBC), the Court found it irrelevant as it occurred *during an approved leave*. If the employee did violate Civil Service rules during the approved leave of absence, then appropriate action can be taken.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 238, Revised Penal Code:** Abandonment of office or position.

**Case Law:**

*   **Gamboa v. Court of Appeals, 194 Phil. 624 (1981):** Defined resignation and its elements.
*   **Reyes v. Atienza, G.R. No. 152243, 23 September 2005, 470 SCRA 670:** Acceptance is necessary for resignation of a public officer to be operative and effective.
*   **Joson III v. Nario, G.R. No. 91548, 13 July 1990, 187 SCRA 453:** Resignation may be withdrawn before its acceptance

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was whether Singun had been duly *notified* of the acceptance of his resignation. The DTI argued that the approval of the leave of absence implied acceptance, but the Court disagreed. This highlights the importance of explicit notification of acceptance.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The court emphasizes the necessity of acceptance by the *proper authority*, implying scrutiny of delegation and authority to accept resignations. The failure to formally notify the employee is fatal to the validity of the resignation. The validity of the detail order issued by the Undersecretary hinged on whether Singun had effectively resigned.
