**Case Summary: *China Banking Corporation v. Ta Fa Industries, Inc., et al.* (G.R. No. 160113, April 30, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision which upheld the RTC's grant of a preliminary injunction against extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Facts:**

*   Ta Fa Industries, Inc. (Ta Fa), J & H Industries, Inc., and Jean Long Industries, Inc. (Respondents) executed promissory notes in favor of China Banking Corporation (Petitioner), secured by real estate mortgages.
*   Respondents defaulted on the promissory notes.
*   Petitioner initiated extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   Respondents filed a complaint with the RTC seeking an accounting, specific performance, and a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain the foreclosure.
*   The RTC granted the preliminary injunction, finding that Petitioner failed to remit the full loan proceeds.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Notes:** Respondents' obligation to pay specified amounts plus interest per the terms of the notes.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Security interests granted by Respondents to Petitioner to secure the promissory notes, granting the right to foreclose upon default.
*   **Offset Clause (Crucial):** The promissory notes contain a clause authorizing Petitioner to apply funds in its possession to the debt, even before maturity.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents' Liability:** Monetary liability for the outstanding debt under the promissory notes, subject to accounting. Risk of foreclosure on their properties.
*   **Petitioner's Risk (Removed by Decision):** Risk of being enjoined from foreclosing on the properties, delaying recovery of its debt.

**Reasoning & Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision, dissolving the preliminary injunction. The Court held that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the injunction because:

1.  **Respondents Failed to Meet Burden of Proof:** The respondents had the burden to demonstrate a clear legal right being violated and failed to do so. The testimony of their witness, Atty. Silo, was incompetent and based on speculation, not concrete evidence. *See L.C. Ordoñez Construction v. Nicdao, G.R. No. 149669, July 27, 2006.*
2.  **Erroneous Factual Findings:** The RTC misinterpreted Petitioner's witness testimony, concluding that the loan proceeds were not fully released when, in fact, a portion was applied to a prior debt with the consent of Ta Fa as stipulated in the promissory notes.
3.  **Disregarding Valid Contractual Provision:** The lower courts disregarded the explicit offset clause in the promissory notes, empowering the bank to apply proceeds to prior debts. The SC emphasized that courts should not lightly issue injunctions, especially when interfering with contractual rights. *See Ocampo v. Vda. de Fernandez, G.R. No. 164529, June 19, 2007; Republic of the Philippines v. Caguioa, G.R. No. 168584, October 15, 2007*.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 58, Section 3, Revised Rules of Court:** Sets forth the grounds for issuance of a preliminary injunction.
*   **Section 1, Rule 131, Rules of Court:** Governs the burden of proof.
*   *L.C. Ordoñez Construction v. Nicdao, G.R. No. 149669, July 27, 2006:* Burden of proof lies on the party asserting a claim.
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Caguioa, G.R. No. 168584, October 15, 2007:* Requirements for issuance of preliminary injunction. Clear legal right, material invasion, and urgent necessity.
*   *Ocampo v. Vda. de Fernandez, G.R. No. 164529, June 19, 2007:* Caution and prudence required in issuing injunctions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key contentious point revolved around whether the loan proceeds were fully released. The RTC incorrectly interpreted the application of a portion of the loan to a previous debt as a failure to fully release the loan, which was explicitly permitted by the offset clause. The interpretation and application of the offset clause are critical.

**Potential Arguments/Further Research:**

*   Explore the documentation supporting the disbursement of loan proceeds and the application of funds to prior debts.
*   Research case law interpreting similar offset clauses in promissory notes and mortgages.
*   Consider the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling on the pending case for accounting and specific performance. The accounting issue is still live.
