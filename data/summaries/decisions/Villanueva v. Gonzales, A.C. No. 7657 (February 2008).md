**Summary:**

Atty. Gonzales is found guilty of gross negligence and professional misconduct for failing to provide legal services, account for client funds, and return client documents (particularly a TCT) after accepting a fee. He neglected the client's matter, failed to keep her informed, and failed to respond to IBP inquiries. The Supreme Court suspended him for two years and ordered him to return the TCT and all other unspecified documents, warning of a more severe penalty for non-compliance. The main issue is that Atty. Gonzales received money and the TCT from the Complainant, promised to transfer a title, and did nothing.
