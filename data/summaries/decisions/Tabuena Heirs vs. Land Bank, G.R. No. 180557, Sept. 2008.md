**Case Summary: Heirs of Roque F. Tabuena vs. Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)**

**Citation:** 588 Phil. 233 (G.R. No. 180557, September 26, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Determination of just compensation for land expropriated under P.D. No. 27 (Agrarian Reform Law). Whether the landowners (Heirs of Tabuena) are estopped from claiming higher compensation after executing a Deed of Assignment of Rights and accepting initial payment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **P.D. No. 27 & R.A. No. 6657 (CARP):** Land expropriation for agrarian reform purposes. Requires just compensation.
*   **Deed of Assignment of Rights:** Landowners assigned their rights to LBP in exchange for a specific compensation. LBP argues this extinguished its obligation.
*   **LBP's Role:** Valuation and compensation of landholdings acquired under CARP.  Has standing to appeal independently of DAR. (Section 74 of Republic Act (RA) No. 3844 and Section 64 of RA No. 6657)
*   **Landowner-Tenant Production Agreement and Farmers Undertaking (LTPA-FU):** Initial agreement on land valuation, though landowners subsequently challenged it.

**Liabilities:**

*   **LBP's Potential Liability:** If the Deed of Assignment of Rights is invalid, LBP would be liable to pay additional just compensation as determined by the court.
*   **Landowners' Potential Liability:** To pay deficiency in docket fees based on the court-determined valuation.

**Key Legal Arguments & Case Law:**

*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The case bypassed the DARAB process initially, but was later remanded. The Supreme Court highlights that landowners can challenge DAR valuation in court.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The Court allowed the Deed of Assignment of Rights, even though not formally offered, because it was pleaded as an affirmative defense and the landowners failed to specifically deny its genuineness and due execution under oath (Rule 8, Sections 7 & 8, Rules of Court). Reference: *Far East Bank & Trust Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 149589, September 15, 2006, 502 SCRA 87, 90.
*   **Estoppel:** The landowners are estopped from claiming higher compensation because they executed the Deed of Assignment of Rights and received payment.  Bare allegations of duress (related to Martial Law) are insufficient without supporting evidence.
*   **Laches:** The landowners' delay of over 20 years in challenging the Deed of Assignment of Rights constitutes laches, barring their claim.
*   **Just Compensation Valuation:** The court cites that just compensation should be based on the value of the land *at the time of taking*, not at the time of the judgment.
*    **Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** G.R. No. 164195, December 19, 2007, 541 SCRA 117, 141. Discusses the proper recourse for landowners who disagree with LBP valuations.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco:** G.R. No. 140160 & 146733, January 13, 2004, 419 SCRA 67, 75. Discusses appeal process for Land Valuation and Preliminary Determination and Payment of Just Compensation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Duress Argument:** Landowners' claim of duress related to Martial Law, while ultimately unsuccessful due to lack of evidence, represents a potential avenue for challenging the validity of the Deed of Assignment of Rights. However, the court ruled that there were no specific examples of duress or compulsion to prove this claim.
*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** The initial valuation set by DAR (P105,572.48) significantly differs from the trial court's valuation (PHP4,855,000.00). This disparity, while ultimately irrelevant due to estoppel and laches, highlights the difficulties in determining just compensation.
*   **Procedural Issues:** While the Court addressed procedural defects, it did not consider whether these deficiencies prejudiced the Landowners.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which reversed the Regional Trial Court and dismissed the landowners' complaint. The landowners were found to be estopped and guilty of laches.
