## Legal Document Summary: Fernandez vs. Amagna, G.R. No. 152614

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 concerning an unlawful detainer action. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, which upheld the RTC decision ordering Petitioner Fernandez to vacate Respondent Amagna's property and pay unpaid rentals.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** A verbal month-to-month lease agreement existed between Fernandez (lessee) and Amagna (lessor). Such agreements, lacking a fixed period, are considered definite and expire at the end of each month with proper demand and notice to vacate.
*   **Rental Payments:** Fernandez failed to pay rent for over three months, constituting a valid ground for ejectment under Sec. 5(b) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 877 (Rent Control Law). The Court found Fernandez failed to adequately prove his contention that the monthly rental was lower than Amagna alleged (P420 vs. P1,300).
*   **Consignation:** Fernandez attempted to consign back rentals after the ejectment suit was filed, which the Court ruled did not waive Amagna's right to eject him. Acceptance of arrears after filing suit does not legitimize unlawful possession.
*   **Vacate Order:** Fernandez is obligated to vacate the premises, remove improvements, and pay unpaid rentals at P1,300/month from July 1995 until vacating the premises.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Unpaid Rent:** Fernandez is liable for unpaid rentals as determined by the lower courts.
*   **Eviction:** Fernandez faces eviction from the property.
*   **Demolition:** Liable to remove or demolish the structure he built on the premises

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Ejectment:** Amagna can enforce the ejectment order and pursue collection of unpaid rentals.
*   **Damages:** If the demolition is not performed by Fernandez, Amagna may seek a special order and damages associated with the costs of demolition, but this should follow Rule 39, Section 10(d).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Art. 1687:** Governs lease periods where no specific term is fixed, establishing month-to-month basis for monthly rent payments.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 877 (Rent Control Law):** Section 5(b) allows judicial ejectment for arrears in rent for three months, specifying conditions for consignation.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1517 (Urban Land Reform Act):** Claimed protection under Section 6 ("no eviction rule") was rejected as Fernandez failed to prove the property was in an Area for Priority Development (APD) or Urban Land Reform Zone (ULRZ), and was also not considered a legitimate tenant. Cited *Heirs of Antonio Bobadilla v. Castillo* regarding requirements for claiming benefits under P.D. 1517.
*   **Acab v. Court of Appeals:** Affirms that month-to-month leases have definite periods and expire with demand and notice.
*   **Ulep v. Court of Appeals:** New issues raised on appeal will not be considered.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Rental Amount:** Disputed rental amount (P420 vs. P1,300). The Court deferred to the lower courts' finding that Fernandez failed to adequately prove the lower rental rate.
*   **Applicability of Ordinance No. 8020:** Fernandez argued that the City of Manila ordinance authorizing acquisition of the property for resale to tenants should prevent eviction. The Court rejected this, as the ordinance was enacted *after* the ejectment case was filed and lacked retroactive application. It should be noted that this argument was first raised in the Motion for Reconsideration in the CA

**Risks and Further Action**
Fernandez failed to show that Zamora Street, the place where the subject property is situated, was identified as APD/ULRZ by Proclamation No. 1967. Except for his allegation, which respondent refutes, that the property is within the area for priority development zone, Fernandez presented no concrete proof to substantiate said claim.
