## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Siton* (G.R. No. 169364)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the constitutionality of Article 202(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) concerning vagrancy.

**Background:** Respondents were charged with vagrancy under Art. 202(2) of the RPC. The Municipal Trial Court denied their Motions to Quash. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) granted their Petition for Certiorari and declared Art. 202(2) unconstitutional for vagueness and violation of the equal protection clause, relying heavily on *Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville*.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 202(2) RPC:** Defines a vagrant as "Any person found loitering about public or semi-public buildings or places, or tramping or wandering about the country or the streets without visible means of support."
*   **Respondents' Argument:** Art. 202(2) is unconstitutionally vague, violating due process and equal protection rights. It discriminates against the poor and unemployed by criminalizing ordinary peaceful acts.
*   **Petitioner (State)'s Argument:** The RTC erred. Statutes are presumed constitutional. The overbreadth and vagueness doctrines primarily apply to free speech cases (*Estrada v. Sandiganbayan*). Respondents failed to prove the statute is vague. The State's police power justifies regulating conduct for public welfare.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Art. 202(2) is vague and violates equal protection. It grants police arbitrary power, mirroring the unconstitutional vagrancy ordinance in *Papachristou*. No reasonable classification exists between those "without visible means of support by force of circumstance" and those who choose to "loiter about and bum around."

**Court's Ruling:** Petition granted; RTC decision reversed. Art. 202(2) is Constitutional.

**Reasoning & Case Law:**

*   **Legislative Power & Police Power:** Defining crimes and prescribing penalties is a legislative function under the State's police power.
*   **Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine:** Recognized as applicable to criminal statutes (*Spouses Romualdez v. COMELEC*), but not applicable here.
*   **Distinction from *Papachristou*:** Unlike the Jacksonville ordinance, Art. 202(2) is not invalid. *Papachristou*'s rationale stemmed from specific provisions criminalizing ordinary activities. While Article 202 (2) is qualified by "without visible means of support" unlike the Jacksonville ordinance that prohibited wandering or strolling "without any lawful purpose or object". Also, the Court noted that under Philippine law, ignorance of the law is not an excuse. (Article 3, Civil Code)
*   **Probable Cause:** The constitutional requirement of probable cause before arrest and search mitigates the risk of arbitrary police power.
*   **Equal Protection:** The law does not discriminate against the poor but punishes conduct endangering public peace and alarm.
*   **Public Order & Morality:** The law seeks to maintain order, peace, civility, decency, and morality on the streets.
*   **Presumption of Constitutionality:** Every statute is presumed valid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Vagueness Concerns:** While the Court upheld its constitutionality, critics could argue that the definition of "loitering" and "without visible means of support" still leaves room for subjective interpretation and potential for discriminatory enforcement.
