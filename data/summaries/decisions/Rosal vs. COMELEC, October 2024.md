## Legal Document Summary: Rosal v. COMELEC, et al. (G.R. Nos. 264125, 266775, 266796, 269274)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Certiorari under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 assailing COMELEC Resolutions disqualifying Noel Rosal, Carmen Rosal, and Jose Barizo from running in the May 9, 2022 NLE, and related proclamations/successions.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Disqualification:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in disqualifying Noel Rosal (Governor), Carmen Rosal (Mayor), and Jose Barizo (Councilor).
*   **Vote-Buying (Sec. 68(a) OEC):** Allegation of giving money/material consideration to influence voters. COMELEC found no vote-buying for Noel and Barizo but reversed itself on reconsideration for Carmen. Court finds there was no vote-buying for any of them. Cites *Lozano v. Yorac* (280 Phil. 280 (1991)) and *Mendoza v. COMELEC* (618 Phil. 706) for analysis on Vote Buying.
*   **Prohibited Release of Public Funds (Sec. 261(v)(2) OEC):** Allegation of releasing, disbursing, or expending public funds for social welfare projects within 45 days before election; also the participation, directly or indirectly, in the distribution of relief or goods by a candidate. Prohibition against release, disbursement or expenditure of public funds.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 10747:** Whether the cash assistance program was properly exempted. COMELEC says that the program did not fall under exceptions from prohibited activities.
*   **Succession/Proclamation:** Whether the Vice Governor (for Noel) and the second-placer (for Carmen) should be proclaimed. Cristobal, the Vice Mayor, questions the proclamation of the second placer.

**Ruling:** The court:

*   **Affirms** COMELEC Resolutions in SPA No. 22-031 (DC) and in SPA No. 22-030 (DC), which disqualified Noel and Barizo, respectively, for violation of Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC.
*   **Affirms** the disqualification of Carmen, on the same ground, which is for violation of Section 261 (v)(2) of the OEC.
*    **Denies Intervention** of Bichara due to procedural lapse. COMELEC Resolution determining the vice-governor should replace the govenor upheld.
*  **Remands Cristobal succession/disqualification determination** to COMELEC.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Public officials and employees are prohibited from releasing public funds for specific social welfare programs during the prohibited period (45 days before election), violating Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC.
*  A candidate is also barred from indirect participation in the distribution of relief or other goods pursuant to the prohibition under Section 261 (v)(2).
*   Local Government Code regarding rules on succession.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Indirect Participation":** The interpretation of "indirect participation" in the distribution of relief goods under Section 261(v)(2) of the OEC. The Court ruled that the Spouses Rosal and Barizo were liable for indirect participation through their presence at the distribution of the cash assistance.
*   **Scope of Exception:** The application of COMELEC Resolution No. 10747 on exceptions for projects and programs.
*   **Applicability of Bayanihan Law:** The LGU cannot use the Bayanihan Law (R.A. 11494) as a means to skirt the prohibition against Section 261 (v)(2).

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Sections 68(a), 68(e), 261(v), 261(v)(2), 263
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 10747:** Sections 13, 14
*   **Local Government Code (LGC):** Section 344.

*   ***Lozano v. Yorac* (280 Phil. 280 (1991)):**  Cited regarding the elements of vote-buying and the need for concrete evidence.
*   ***Velez v. People* (860 Phil. 629 (2019)):**  Clarifies that ongoing social development projects are not excluded from the prohibition in Section 261(v)(2)
*  ***Ang Tibay v. CIR* (69 Phil. 635) Due Process standards for administrative proceedings
*   ***Automotive Parts v. Lingad* (140 Phil. 580): Narrow interpretation of statute resulting in injustice or absurdity should be avoided.
