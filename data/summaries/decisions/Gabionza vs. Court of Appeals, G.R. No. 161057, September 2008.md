Okay, here's a legal summary of *G.R. No. 161057, September 12, 2008, Gabionza and Tan v. Court of Appeals, Roxas and Nolasco* in markdown format.

**Case Summary: *Gabionza and Tan v. Court of Appeals, Roxas, and Nolasco* (G.R. No. 161057)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing a Department of Justice (DOJ) resolution directing the filing of Informations for estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code and violation of the Revised Securities Act (RSA) against private respondents.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners Gabionza and Tan, along with other investors, filed complaints against Roxas (President of ASB Holdings, Inc. - ASBHI) and Nolasco (Senior VP/Treasurer of ASBHI) for estafa and violation of the RSA, Revised Securities Act, and General Banking Act.
*   ASBHI, with a declared primary purpose to invest, solicited funds from petitioners, representing itself as financially stable and connected to Bank of Southeast Asia (BSA) initially and later DBS Bank.
*   Petitioners received postdated checks from ASBHI, which were initially honored, fostering confidence and leading to loan renewals.
*   Later, DBS Bank dishonored the checks due to "stop payment" orders. ASBHI filed for rehabilitation with the SEC, obtaining an order enjoining payment of liabilities.
*   The DOJ Task Force initially dismissed the complaints. The Secretary of Justice partially reversed, ordering the filing of Informations for estafa under Art. 315(2)(a) and violation of the RSA.
*   The Court of Appeals reversed the DOJ, ordering the dismissal of the criminal cases.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Estafa under Article 315(2)(a), Revised Penal Code:** The Court determines whether the elements of estafa by means of deceit are present:
    *   *(a) False Pretense:* The DOJ found that ASBHI misrepresented its financial capacity given its low capitalization.
    *   *(b) Timing:* The misrepresentations were made prior to or simultaneous with petitioners parting with their money.
    *   *(c) Reliance:* Petitioners relied on the representations of ASBHI's creditworthiness.
    *   *(d) Damage:* Petitioners suffered significant financial losses.
    *   The CA erred in applying *Sesbreno v. Court of Appeals*, which involved estafa through misappropriation (Art. 315(1)(b)), not estafa through deceit (Art. 315(2)(a)).

2.  **Violation of the Revised Securities Act (RSA), Specifically Section 4 in relation to Section 56:** The Court determined if the checks issued by ASBHI constituted unregistered securities and the post-dated checks were "commercial papers evidencing indebtedness.

3.  **Liability of Roxas and Nolasco:** Despite the lack of direct dealings with the petitioners, the Court considered whether Roxas and Nolasco induced the fraud through instructions to ASBHI agents, citing Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code. The Court found that the non-inclusion of the traders or employee is not fatal to the case because the determination of criminal liability is individual to each of the defendant.

**Obligations:**

*   ASBHI had an obligation to accurately represent its financial condition.
*   Roxas and Nolasco had an obligation to ensure that ASBHI's agents did not make false representations.
*   Potential obligation to register securities under the Revised Securities Act.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential criminal liability for Roxas and Nolasco for estafa under Art. 315(2)(a) and violation of the RSA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Criminal prosecution and conviction for estafa and violation of securities laws.
*   Reputational damage.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315(2)(a):** Estafa by means of deceit.
*   **Revised Securities Act (RSA), Sections 4 and 56:** Registration of securities.
*   **Article 17, Revised Penal Code:** Defines principals in a crime.

*   **Securities Regulation Code of 2000, Sections 8 and 73**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the postdated checks issued by ASBHI constituted "securities" under the RSA. The Court considered that the checks could be considered evidences of indebtdness especially with the continuous rollovers of investments that the patrons had with ASBHI.
*   The extent of Roxas and Nolasco's direct involvement in or knowledge of the alleged fraudulent representations made by ASBHI agents.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstating the DOJ resolutions. The Court found that the DOJ established probable cause for estafa and violation of the RSA. The ultimate determination of guilt or innocence is left for a full trial on the merits.
