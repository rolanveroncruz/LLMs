## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 237714: Republic vs. Science Park of the Philippines, Inc. (SPPI)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming MCTC grant of SPPI's application for original land registration under PD 1529, Sec. 14(1).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA correctly upheld the MCTC's grant of land registration to SPPI.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **REVERSED** the CA decision, **DENYING** SPPI's application for original registration.

**Key Provisions & Requirements under PD 1529, Sec. 14(1):**

*   Applicant must prove:
    *   Land is alienable and disposable at the time of application.
    *   Open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation by applicant and predecessors-in-interest.
    *   Possession under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.

**Deficiencies in SPPI's Proof:**

1.  **Insufficient Proof of Possession Since June 12, 1945:**
    *   Earliest Tax Declaration (TD No. 6243) only dates back to 1955.  Requirement is possession since June 12, 1945 *or earlier*.
    *   Mere reference to a prior tax declaration (TD 1052) without proof of claimant or effective date is insufficient.
    *   Testimony about playing and gathering fruits on the land is insufficient to establish required acts of dominion/ownership (nature and extent of cultivation).
2.  **Lack of Clear, Positive, and Convincing Evidence of Open, Continuous, Exclusive, and Notorious Possession**
    *   Failed to establish exclusivity and notoriety of possession (exclusive dominion and conspicuous possession thereof were not established)

**Regarding Alienability/Disposability:**

*   SPPI presented a CENRO certification and certified copy of LC Map No. 3601 pursuant to DAO 97-37 indicating the land was within alienable and disposable zone.
*   The Court upheld the MCTC's taking judicial notice of DAO 97-37 due to:
    *   Lack of objection by the Government Prosecutor.
    *   Government Prosecutor's satisfaction that the presented copy was duly certified (stipulation in a prior case).
    *   The Court affirmed that land need not be declared alienable/disposable on June 12, 1945, only that it be so *at the time of application*.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. Naguit, 489 Phil. 405 (2005):** Clarifies that land only needs to be alienable and disposable *at the time of application*, not necessarily since June 12, 1945.
*   **Republic v. Estate of Santos, 802 Phil. 800 (2016):** Outlines requirements for proving possession under PD 1529, Sec. 14(1).
*   **Republic v. Remman Enterprises, Inc., 727 Phil. 608 (2014):** Defines "actual possession" and the elements of open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession.
*   **Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation v. Commissioner of Customs, G.R. No. 195876, December 5, 2016:** Defines Judicial Notice and the Exceptions

**Potential Risks/Liabilities for SPPI:**

*   Loss of right to original registration.
*   Potential claims from other parties possessing stronger evidence of ownership or possession.
*   Future applications for registration will face increased scrutiny due to this ruling.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** N/A
