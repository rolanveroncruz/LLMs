**Legal Document Summary: BCDA vs. CJH Development Corporation**

**Case:** G.R. No. 219421 and G.R. No. 241772 (Consolidated)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA)
*   **Respondents:** CJH Development Corporation (CJH DevCo), et al.
*   **Respondent in G.R. No. 241772:** Commission on Audit (COA)

**Subject Matter:** Dispute arising from a rescinded lease agreement between BCDA and CJH DevCo regarding a portion of the John Hay Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ). The key issue is the enforcement of the Final Arbitral Award issued by the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center, Inc. (PDRCI).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rescission of Lease Agreement:** The arbitral tribunal ruled for mutual rescission of the 1996 Lease Agreement and subsequent agreements due to mutual breach. This is grounded in Article 1191 of the New Civil Code regarding reciprocal obligations.
*   **Mutual Restitution:** Both parties are required to return to their original positions before the agreement. CJH DevCo must vacate and deliver the leased property (including all new constructions and permanent improvements) to BCDA.
*   **Rental Refund:** BCDA is ordered to return PHP 1,421,096,052.00 to CJH DevCo, representing total rentals paid.
*   **Sub-lessees:** CJH DevCo subleased portions of the property. The Final Arbitral Award is silent on the rights of these sub-lessees, creating uncertainty regarding their eviction. The CA attempted to address these issues with a compulsory arbitration provision but the Supreme Court reversed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **CJH DevCo:** Obligation to vacate and deliver the leased property per the Final Arbitral Award.
*   **BCDA:** Obligation to refund rental payments to CJH DevCo.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sub-lessees' Rights:** The rights of sub-lessees who have contracts with CJH DevCo but were not parties to the arbitration. The question of whether these rights are subordinate to the Final Arbitral Award. The CA's injunction against the writ of execution affecting sub-lessees was overturned by the Supreme Court.
*   **Simultaneous Performance:** The CA incorrectly conditioned CJH DevCo's vacating the property upon the BCDA's payment of the refund. This was deemed an improper modification of the Final Arbitral Award by the Supreme Court.
*   **COA's Role:** The COA's dismissal of CJH DevCo's money claim pending the Supreme Court's decision was upheld. The COA's jurisdiction over enforcing final money judgments is limited to ensuring compliance with auditing laws.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Final Arbitral Award's direction to revert the parties to their original positions "as far as practicable" leaves room for interpretation regarding the precise scope of restitution, particularly concerning the improvements on the leased property and the rights of the sub-lessees.

**Holding:**

*   **G.R. No. 219421:** The Supreme Court *granted* BCDA's Petition. The CA's decision was *reversed and set aside*, reinstating the RTC order confirming the Final Arbitral Award and the writ of execution.
*   **G.R. No. 241772:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* CJH DevCo's Petition. The COA's decision to dismiss the money claim was *affirmed*.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court emphasized the principle of respecting the autonomy of arbitral awards and strictly limiting judicial intervention to the grounds outlined in the Special ADR Rules. The CA erred in modifying the Final Arbitral Award and imposing additional obligations. The Supreme Court reinforced the finality and executory nature of confirmed arbitral awards. The COAâ€™s actions were appropriate given the pending dispute at the Supreme Court. This case reinforces the limited scope of judicial review in arbitration matters and the need for parties to abide by the outcome of arbitration proceedings.
