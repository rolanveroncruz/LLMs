## Legal Document Summary: Sta. Ana v. Carpo, G.R. No. 164340, November 28, 2008

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari reversing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision and reinstating a Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) decision, ultimately ruling in favor of the agricultural tenant.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Ejectment for Non-Payment of Lease Rentals:** The core issue is whether the tenant, Petitioner Sta. Ana, should be ejected for non-payment of lease rentals to Respondents Carpo.
*   **Willful and Deliberate Non-Payment:** The SC emphasizes that ejectment requires a *willful and deliberate* failure to pay rentals, citing *Roxas y Cia v. Cabatuando, 1 SCRA 1106*.  Mere failure to pay is insufficient if there is a lack of deliberate intent.
*   **Land Classification and Conversion:** A central point of contention is whether the land has been converted from agricultural to residential/commercial/industrial.  The CA found it had, based on a zoning ordinance and vicinity map.
*   **DAR's Primary Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court holds that the CA and PARAD (Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator) erred in determining the land's status, emphasizing the Department of Agrarian Reform's (DAR) *primary jurisdiction* over land classification, conversion, and retention rights. Cites *Department of Agrarian Reform v. Abdulwahid, G.R. No. 163285, February 27, 2008*.
*   **Tenancy Relationship:** The SC acknowledges an established tenancy relationship between the parties, granting the tenant security of tenure.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Tenant Obligation:**  The tenant is obligated to pay lease rentals when due (Section 36, RA 3844).
*   **Landowner Obligation:** Landowners must respect the tenant's peaceful possession and cultivation.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The landowner bears the *burden of proof* to demonstrate a lawful cause for ejectment (Section 37, RA 3844).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of DAR Determination:** The absence of a formal determination by the DAR Secretary regarding land conversion or retention rights creates legal uncertainty.  The SC *specifically* remands these issues to the DAR Secretary.
*   **Disputed Payment History:**  Conflicting evidence exists regarding the tenant's attempts to pay rent, highlighting the importance of proper documentation and communication in landlord-tenant relationships.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** The delayed filing of the Motion for Extension, while ultimately excused, serves as a reminder of the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3844:** Agricultural Land Reform Code
*   **RA 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL)
*   **PD 27:** Emancipation of Tenants Decree
*   **EO 228:** Declaring Full Land Ownership to Qualified Farmer Beneficiaries

**Conclusion:**

This decision underscores the primacy of the DAR's jurisdiction in agrarian reform matters, particularly land conversion and retention.  It clarifies that ejectment requires a willful and deliberate failure to pay rent, not merely a failure to deliver payment. While the tenant prevailed in this instance, the unresolved issues concerning land status necessitates an administrative determination by the DAR Secretary.
