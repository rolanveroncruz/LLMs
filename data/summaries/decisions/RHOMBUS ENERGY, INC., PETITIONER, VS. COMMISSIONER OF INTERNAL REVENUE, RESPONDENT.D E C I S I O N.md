**Case Summary: *Rhombus Energy, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*** (G.R. No. 206362, August 01, 2018)

**Issue:** Whether Rhombus Energy, Inc. is barred by the irrevocability rule in claiming a refund of excess and/or unutilized creditable withholding tax (CWT) for the 2005 taxable year.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Section 76 NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code):**  Dictates that once the option to carry over excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable *for that taxable period*, and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed.
*   **Irrevocability Rule:** This doctrine, established in *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of the Philippine Islands* and *Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation*,  holds that once a taxpayer chooses an option (carry-over vs. refund) regarding excess CWT, that choice is irrevocable.  The CTA En Banc initially applied this rule against Rhombus.
*   **Taxpayer's Actions:**
    *   Rhombus indicated "To be refunded" in its 2005 Annual Income Tax Return (ITR).
    *   Rhombus reported prior year's excess credits (including the 2005 CWT) in its 2006 Quarterly ITRs.
    *   Rhombus's 2006 Annual ITR did not reflect prior year's excess credits.
*   **CTA En Banc Decision:** Reversed the CTA First Division, applying the irrevocability rule because Rhombus reported prior year's excess credits in the 2006 quarterly ITRs.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the CTA En Banc, ruling that Rhombus validly elected a refund in its 2005 Annual ITR, and this election triggered the irrevocability rule.  The subsequent reporting in the 2006 quarterly ITRs *did not reverse* the earlier election.
*   **Requisites for Refund (established in *Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation*):**
    1.  Claim for refund filed within the two-year reglementary period (Section 229 NIRC).
    2.  Income payment declared as part of the taxpayer's gross income in the ITR.
    3.  Fact of withholding established by a copy of the withholding tax statement.
*   **CTA First Division Findings (Reinstated by SC):**  Rhombus met all requisites for a valid refund claim.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **CIR Obligation:** The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) is obligated to refund or issue a tax credit certificate to Rhombus Energy, Inc. in the amount of P1,500,653.00, representing excess creditable withholding tax for the year 2005.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Section 76:**  The phrase "for that taxable period" could be interpreted in different ways.  The Court of Appeals in *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of the Philippine Islands* mistakenly understood the phrase "for that taxable period" as a prescriptive period for the irrevocability rule, but the Supreme Court rejected this construal.
*   **Flip-Flopping:**  The Court emphasized that the purpose of Section 76 is to prevent taxpayers from flip-flopping on their options, avoiding confusion and complication.  The court construed that the CTA En Bancs reading of the law would allow for the taxpayers to delay this "flip-flopping", and the Courts reading disallowed this.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 76 of the NIRC**
*   **Section 229 of the NIRC**
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of the Philippine Islands*** (592 SCRA 231) - Establishes the irrevocability rule.
*   ***Republic v. Team (Phils.) Energy Corporation*** (G.R. No. 188016, January 14, 2015, 746 SCRA 41) - Clarifies the application of the irrevocability rule and lists the requisites for entitlement to a refund.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mirant (Philippines) Operations, Corporation*** (G.R. No. 171742 & 176165, June 15, 2011, 652 SCRA 80)
*   ***Philam Asset Management, Inc.***

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the irrevocability rule under Section 76 of the NIRC.  The key takeaway is that the *initial* choice of refund or carry-over, clearly manifested in the Annual ITR, is binding. Subsequent actions (e.g., reporting excess credits in quarterly returns) will not negate the irrevocability once the initial election is properly made. Taxpayers must clearly and unequivocally express their chosen option for the treatment of excess CWT in their Annual ITR to avoid future disputes. This is important for avoiding unnecessary complications with the BIR.
