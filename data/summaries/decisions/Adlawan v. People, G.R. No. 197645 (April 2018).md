Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Carlos Jay Adlawan v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 197645, April 18, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Adlawan was initially charged with Frustrated Murder and Attempted Robbery. He was acquitted of Attempted Robbery but convicted of Frustrated Homicide by the RTC.
*   **Factual Basis:** Adlawan attacked his stepmother, Georgia Adlawan, with a katana, inflicting multiple wounds. The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony (Georgia and the driver Fred), a medical certificate, and photographs detailing the injuries. The defense presented the cook, Cornelio, who disputed Adlawan's use of a weapon.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Conviction of Frustrated Homicide, with aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and disrespect due to the victim being his stepmother, her age, and her sex.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the Frustrated Homicide conviction but modified the penalty by removing the aggravating circumstances because they weren't pleaded in the information.

**Issues:**

1.  **Failure of Appellate Review:** Did the CA adequately review the case, particularly regarding the establishment of intent to kill, admissibility of evidence (the katana), the severity of the injuries, and inconsistencies in the victim's testimony?
2.  **Affidavit of Recantation/Desistance:** Should the CA have dismissed the case based on Georgia's affidavit recanting her testimony and claiming the injuries were accidental?

**Court's Holding:**

*   **Affirmed the CA decision; Petition Denied.**

**Reasoning:**

*   **Failure of Appellate Review:**  The Supreme Court found that the issues raised were primarily factual questions, inappropriate for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Court held that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Adlawan intended to kill his stepmother.
*   **Affidavit of Recantation/Desistance:**  The Court rejected the affidavit of recantation/desistance. It emphasized that retractions are viewed with disfavor, especially post-conviction. The Court found Georgia's original testimony in court to be credible and consistent, whereas the affidavit explanation of the injuries as accidental was implausible given the nature of the wounds.  The Court stated that no special circumstances existed to raise doubts about the original trial testimony.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Revised Rules on Civil Procedure, Rule 51, Section 5.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The primary risk would have been the possible acceptance of the affidavit of recantation. The Court explicitly outlines why such retractions are generally unreliable.

**Key Obligations:**

*   The key obligation stemming from the affirmed conviction is Adlawan's obligation to serve the prison sentence (6 years *prision correccional* minimum, to 10 years *prision mayor* maximum) and to pay the victim P30,000 in moral damages plus all her medical expenses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Pascual v. Burgos*, 776 Phil. 167, 182 (2016).
*   *People v. Zafra*, 712 Phil. 559,576 (2013).
*   *Abella v. People*, 719 Phil. 53, 66 (2013).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for Frustrated Homicide, finding the evidence sufficient and dismissing the affidavit of recantation as unreliable. This case reinforces the principle that post-conviction retractions are heavily scrutinized and rarely accepted unless accompanied by compelling circumstances undermining the original trial testimony.
