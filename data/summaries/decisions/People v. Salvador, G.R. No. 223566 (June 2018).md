## Legal Document Summary: People v. Salvador, Sr. (G.R. No. 223566)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) joint decision convicting Accused-Appellant Junie Salvador, Sr. of five counts of murder/parricide.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Five Informations; Crim. Case No. 17628 for parricide (Art. 246, RPC) of son Junie Salvador, Jr.; Crim. Case Nos. 17629, 17631, and 17632 for murder (Art. 248, RPC) of Rosana Realo, Mariz Masayang, and Jonessa Masayang, respectively; Crim. Case No. 17630 for murder (Art. 248, RPC) of live-in partner Miraflor Realo.
*   **Defense:** Insanity (Art. 12, par. 1, RPC). Argued that accused suffered from Schizoaffective Disorder, impairing his mental condition.
*   **Ruling:** Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming conviction for parricide in one case and murder in the other four, but MODIFIED the penalties and damages. Voluntary surrender was considered a mitigating circumstance.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** To serve *reclusion perpetua* in each case.
*   **Accused-Appellant:** Obligated to pay damages to the heirs of each victim (Junie Salvador, Jr., Rosana Realo, Miraflor Realo, Mariz Masayang, Jannes Masayang), including civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages.
*   **State:**  To provide appropriate penal confinement, given possible mental health issues.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for Parricide and Murder.
*   **Civil Liability:** Monetary damages awarded to the heirs of the victims.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Points:**

*   **Insanity Defense:** The central issue is whether the insanity defense was sufficiently proven.  The court emphasizes the stringent standard for establishing insanity under Philippine law, requiring "complete deprivation of intelligence" *at the time of the crime.* Evidence of the disorder was obtained *after* the crimes occurred, which weakened the defense. Note reliance of the courts on *People v. Roa* and *People v. Racal.*
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The Supreme Court appreciated voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance.
*   **Treachery:** Treachery was present in the killing of children due to their vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Evident Premeditation** Apparent lack of analysis or finding regarding the alleged element of evident premeditation, indicating potential for challenge.
*    **Correctness of Penalties:** Despite modifying penalties due to mitigating circumstances, the ruling could still be challenged if any additional facts or arguments could mitigate the offences.
*   **Mental Health Treatment:** While imprisonment is affirmed, the accused's established mental health history warrants attention regarding access to appropriate psychiatric care while incarcerated.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 12, par. 1, RPC:** Insanity as an exempting circumstance.
