## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Roger Jarque vs. Marcial Jarque, et al.* (G.R. No. 196733, November 21, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to nullify CA Decision regarding ownership of unregistered land (Lot No. 2560) in Casiguran, Sorsogon.

**Key Issue:** Who has the better right to Lot No. 2560: Heirs of Roger Jarque (Roger) or Marcial Jarque, Lelia Jarque-Lagsit, and Teresita Jarque-Bailon (Respondents).

**Background:**

*   Laureano Jarque (Laureano) owned the land. Upon his death in 1946, his estate was inherited by his wife, Servanda Hagos (Servanda) and their four children, including Roger and Lupo.
*   Petitioners (Heirs of Roger) claim oral partition ceded the land to Roger. Roger mortgaged and redeemed the property twice.
*   Respondents (children of Lupo) claim Servanda sold the land with right to repurchase to Benito Coranes (Benito), and later transferred the right to Dominga (Lupo's daughter) who then repurchased it. Respondents subsequently acquired the land through Dominga.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Applicable Law:** The Supreme Court ruled that the Old Civil Code applies to the succession following Laureano's death in 1946. It recognizes that Laureano and Servanda's property regime was conjugal partnership, which dissolved upon Laureano's death. Servanda was entitled to a 1/2 share, and the children inherited 2/3 of the estate. Her successional rights were limited to usufruct of the legitimate children's share.
*   **Oral Partition:** The Court found evidence of an oral partition when Roger exercised ownership over the property (mortgaging & redeeming it) after Laureano's death, terminating the co-ownership. *Hernandez v. Andal, 78 Phil. 196 (1947)* supports the enforcement of oral partitions with part performance.
*   **Servanda's Authority to Sell:** Without a formal partition, Servanda only held a co-ownership share. She couldn't alienate a specific part of the land excluding other co-owners. Cites *Carvajal v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-44426, February 25, 1982* regarding co-ownership rights under Article 493 of the New Civil Code. Selling her aliquot share is permissible, but not the entire land.
*   **Dominga's Redemption:**  Dominga's purported acquisition via repurchase does not automatically vest title. The right to repurchase is separate from ownership *David v. David, G.R. No. 162365, January 15, 2014,*. Evidence of the transfer of *right to repurchase* from Servanda to Dominga is lacking. At most, Dominga was Servanda's agent, and reacquired Servanda's rights (aliquot share or usufruct), not full ownership.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription (Art. 1117 Civil Code):** Respondents' claim of extraordinary prescription (30 years) fails because possession was initially by tolerance, not adverse, and was interrupted by Roger's repeated demands to recover the property. Cites *Marcelo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 131803, April 14, 1999* emphasizing possession *en concepto de due√±o*.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   Granted the Petition. Reinstated the MCTC Decision (finding for Petitioners) with modifications on interest rates based on *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, G.R. No. 189871, August 13, 2013.*

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents are liable to vacate the property and surrender possession to Petitioners.
*   Respondents are liable for the return of P950.00 (amount Dominga used to redeem the property), with legal interest from judicial demand.
*   Respondents are liable for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees as awarded by the MCTC, also with legal interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Enforcement of the MCTC decision may encounter resistance from Respondents.
*   Further litigation could arise regarding the exact amount of interest owed.
*   Potential challenges to the oral partition's validity by other heirs (not party to this case) still exist although reduced.

*   Old Civil Code
*   Article 493, New Civil Code
*   Article 1117 Civil Code (Acquisitive Prescription)
