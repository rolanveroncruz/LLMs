**Nature:** Disciplinary case against Atty. Honesto A. Cabarroguis for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Canon 16, CPR:** A lawyer shall hold in trust all moneys and properties of his client.
*   **Rule 16.04, CPR:** A lawyer shall not borrow money from his client unless the client's interests are fully protected by the nature of the case or independent advice. Neither shall a lawyer lend money to a client except when, in the interest of justice, he has to advance necessary expenses in a legal matter he is handling for the client.

**Factual Background:** Atty. Cabarroguis represented Dario Tangcay in a probate case involving land inherited by Tangcay. Atty. Cabarroguis learned Tangcay's property was mortgaged. He then loaned Tangcay PHP 200,000 secured by a real estate mortgage on the same property.  Tangcay defaulted, and Atty. Cabarroguis initiated judicial foreclosure.

**Obligations Violated:** Atty. Cabarroguis violated Rule 16.04, Canon 16 of the CPR by lending money to his client, Tangcay. This is a violation of fiduciary duty, creating a conflict of interest.

**Liabilities:** Atty. Cabarroguis is suspended from the practice of law for three (3) months, effective upon receipt of the Resolution.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The document asserts a clear violation of Rule 16.04. There is no ambiguity on whether or not the loan occurred as it is evidenced by the mortgage.
*   No explicit discussion in the provided document of defenses raised, or mitigating factors.
*   No specific statutory reference.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **_Linsangan v. Atty. Tolentino_ (A.C. No. 6672, 614 Phil. 327, 335 (2009)):**  This case explains the rationale behind the prohibition of lawyers lending money to clients, emphasizing safeguarding the lawyer's independence and undivided fidelity to the client's cause.
*   **_Roxas v. Republic Real Estate Corporation_ (G.R. Nos. 208205 & 208212, June 1, 2016, 792 SCRA 31, 73-74):**  Highlights that lawyers acquiring an interest in the subject matter of litigation create a conflict of interest and violate their fiduciary duties.
*   **_Anaya v. Alvarez, Jr._ (A.C. No. 9436, August 1, 2016, 799 SCRA 1):** Reiterates that law is not merely a money-making occupation but a profession requiring high standards of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's decision to suspend Atty. Cabarroguis for violating Rule 16.04, Canon 16 of the CPR by lending money to his client. This constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and creates a conflict of interest. The ruling underscores the high ethical standards required of lawyers and prohibits using the attorney-client relationship for personal financial gain.
