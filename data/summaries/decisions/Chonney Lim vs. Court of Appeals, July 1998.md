**Case Summary: *Chonney Lim v. Court of Appeals, Lea Castro Whelan and Keith Lawrence Whelan*, G.R. Nos. 104819-20, July 20, 1998**

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of rescission of a conditional deed of sale and granting specific performance.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Conditional Deed of Sale (March 24, 1984):** Lim (Seller) agreed to sell a parcel of land to Whelan (Buyer) for P600,000 or US$30,000. Property mortgaged to Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). Whelan paid US$9,000 earnest money.
*   **Disputed Payments:** Whelan claimed to have paid additional US$8,000 cash, P141,000 bank draft, and P17,800 check. Lim disputed the US$8,000 and claimed the draft/check were dishonored.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (June 21, 1984):** Executed. Lim obligated himself to deliver TCT with mortgage cancellation, updated real estate tax receipts, capital gains tax receipt, and receipt of full consideration.
*   **Dishonored Draft/Check:** Bank draft (P141,000) dishonored due to bank management ruling. Check (P17,800) dishonored because Lim prematurely encashed another check of Whelan.
*   **Whelan's Payments:** Whelan paid Lim’s mortgage debt to BPI (P210,297.70) and capital gains tax (P14,994.00) without Lim's knowledge.
*   **Legal Actions:** Lim filed for rescission; Whelan filed for specific performance. Cases consolidated.

**Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Denied rescission, granted specific performance. Ruled Whelan made full payment, including the BPI debt and capital gains tax. Ordered Lim to deliver title and pay damages for overpayment, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals, upholding full payment based on facts found.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Lim's Obligations:** Deliver title free from encumbrances and tax liabilities, including the mortgage to BPI and the capital gains tax, as stipulated in the Deed of Absolute Sale. Liable for damages to Whelan due to overpayment.
*   **Whelan's Obligations:** Originally obligated to pay the purchase price. Successfully argued that her payment of Lim’s BPI debt and capital gains tax constituted payment of remaining balance.
*   **Potential Risks for Lim:** Continued liability for damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1236 of the Civil Code:** Regarding payment by a third person, specifically addressing payment without the debtor's knowledge, allowing recovery only to the extent the payment benefitted the debtor.
*   **Article 1249 of the Civil Code:** Deals with the concept of payment which the Petitioner claims was violated by the lower court.
*   **Rehabilitation Finance Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 94 Phil. 984** (cited by the lower court): Jurisprudence supporting that payments made to the benefit of the debtor are permissible.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Payment of US$8,000 Cash:** Lim disputed this payment, arguing for lack of receipt. The Court gave more weight to Whelan's evidence and circumstantial evidence. The alleged note on Lim's copy of the deed of sale appears to be an attempt to falsely indicate that payment was still owed.
*   **Dishonored Bank Draft/Check:** While initially dishonored, the Court determined this did not negate payment, as the fault lay with the bank and Lim's premature encashment of another check.
*   **Third-Party Payment (BPI & Capital Gains Tax):** Lim contested Whelan's payment of his obligations. The Court ruled that Whelan's payment discharged Lim's debt and benefitted him under Article 1236 of the Civil Code.

**Legal Analysis & Potential Arguments (if appealing):**

1.  **Article 1236 - Payment without knowledge or consent:** Lim's argument would likely center on Whelan's unilateral decision to pay the BPI debt and taxes, alleging he was not given the opportunity to make those payments himself and dispute them. However, the Court emphasized the benefit to Lim.
2.  **Burden of Proof:** Lim could argue that Whelan failed to provide sufficient proof of payment, particularly for the US$8,000, and that the presumption favors the party alleging non-payment.
3.  **Contract Interpretation:** Lim might argue that the Deed of Absolute Sale required payment to be made directly to him.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed the decisions of the lower courts, finding that Lea Whelan had indeed fully paid for the property in question.
