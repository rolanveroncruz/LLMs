## Legal Document Summary - *B.F. Metal (Corporation) v. Sps. Lomotan*, G.R. No. 170813 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's award of damages arising from a vehicular accident based on quasi-delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code) and employer liability (Art. 2180, Civil Code).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Liability:** Petitioner B.F. Metal Corporation ("BF Metal") is held solidarily liable with its driver, Onofre Rivera, for damages to the respondents, Sps. Lomotan and Rico Umuyon, due to Rivera's negligence in causing a vehicular accident. Rivera was previously found criminally liable for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with physical injuries. BF Metal's liability is based on its failure to exercise due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employee (Rivera).
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual Damages:** The RTC awarded amounts for the cost of the jeep, medical expenses, and lost earnings. The CA modified, increasing the jeep repair cost but reducing medical and lost earning amounts.
    *   **Moral Damages:** RTC awarded moral damages. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and awarded moral damages solely to Umuyon, the injured party, as he suffered physical injuries resulting from the quasi-delict. No moral damages were awarded to the Sps. Lomotan.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** Affirmed, to serve as an example for the public good.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Affirmed due to the award of exemplary damages (Art. 2208(1), Civil Code).

**Obligations:**

*   BF Metal and Rivera are obligated to jointly and severally pay actual, moral (to Umuyon only), exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit to the respondents.
*   Specifically, BF Metal is obligated to compensate the respondents for pecuniary losses (actual damages) suffered as a result of the accident. The obligation of legal interest has to be shouldered.

**Liabilities:**

*   **BF Metal:** Vicarious liability under Article 2180 for the negligent acts of its employee, Rivera, due to lack of diligence in selection and supervision. Direct liability for negligence under Article 2176 in failing to exercise due care to prevent the accident.
*   **Rivera:** Primary liability for negligence based on his actions that caused the accident. His prior criminal conviction further establishes his negligence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Actual Damages:** The original estimate of the repair cost (Exhibit M), despite being the basis for a substantial portion of the initial award, was deemed insufficient.  The Court relied on *Viron Transportation Co., Inc. v. Delos Santos* (G.R. No. 138296, 2000) in finding that a job estimate is not competent to prove actual damages. No actual proof of expenses incurred for repairs. As such the only awardable was the Deed of Sale reflecting acquisition cost.
*   **Moral Damages to Spouses Lomotan:** The Court emphasized that moral damages arising from quasi-delict require physical injury, intentional tort, or specific grounds under Articles 2219 and 2220 of the Civil Code. Absent these, the award to Spouses Lomotan was reversed. Article 2220 requires willful injury to property, which was not proven.
*   **Interest:** The imposition of legal interest (6% from the RTC decision and 12% from the finality of the Supreme Court decision) represents a significant financial liability. Citing *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA*
*   **Award of Legal Interests from 1997**
