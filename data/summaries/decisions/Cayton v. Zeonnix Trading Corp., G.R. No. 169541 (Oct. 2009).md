**Legal Document Summary - *Cayton v. Zeonnix Trading Corporation*, G.R. No. 169541, October 9, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision which reversed the RTC decision in a case for Quieting of Title involving a property with a prior attachment lien and subsequent extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Parties:**

*   Petitioners: German Cayton and the Heirs of Cecilia Cayton (Caytons) - Claimants to the property via Deed of Absolute Sale with Assumption of Mortgage from the Mañoscas, and purchasers at the foreclosure sale.
*   Respondents: Zeonnix Trading Corporation (Zeonnix) - Judgment creditor of the Mañoscas with a prior, registered levy on attachment on the property; Vicente and Lourdes Mañosca (original owners), Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff of Makati.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale with Assumption of Mortgage (between Mañoscas and Caytons):** Transferred the property to Caytons, who assumed mortgage obligations to Family Savings Bank (FSB). Clause 7 contains a warranty that the property is free of any lien and encumbrance.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage (between Mañoscas and FSB):** Created a lien on the property. This was extrajudicially foreclosed.
*   **Judgement in Civil Case No. 2173 (Zeonnix vs. Mañosca):** Judgement for recovery of sum of money of One Hundred Sixty Seven Thousand Thirty Seven Pesos (Php 167,037.00) in favor of Zeonnix. This judgement allowed Zeonnix to attach the debtor’s property and gave them the right of redemption over the foreclosed property.

**Key Liabilities:**

*   **Caytons:** Failed to register the Deed of Absolute Sale, making their claim unenforceable against third parties with registered interests (like Zeonnix). They also defaulted on mortgage payments leading to foreclosure.
*   **Mañoscas:** Liable for the debt to Zeonnix.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Caytons:** Loss of the property due to Zeonnix's valid redemption. Potentially liable to FSB and Mañoscas for any breaches of the mortgage assumption agreement. Possible claim for damages against the Mañoscas for breach of warranty under Clause 7 of the Deed of Sale.
*   **Zeonnix:** Risk of invalidating the redemption if statutory requirements (amount tendered, notice, etc.) are not strictly met. Although the Court did relax the requirement of paying taxes since the petitioner was notified of the additional expenses.
*   **Mañoscas:** Potential for deficiency judgment if the foreclosure sale proceeds did not cover the full debt to FSB and continue to be judgement obligor to Zeonnix in Civil Case No. 2173.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Sections 27 & 28 of the Rules of Court:** Governs redemption rights, including who may redeem and the manner of redemption.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sections 51 & 52:** Addresses the effect of registration (or non-registration) on land titles, including constructive notice.
*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law), Section 6, as amended by Act No. 4118:** Defines rights of redemption in extrajudicial foreclosure cases.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Huerta Alba Resort, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Right of redemption exists only in the case of the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage unless the mortgagee is a bank
*   ***Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation (Solidbank) v. Intermediate Appellate Court:*** a writ of attachment levied on real property or any interest therein belonging to the judgement debtor creates a lien which nothing can destroy but its dissolution.
*   ***Estanislao, Jr. v. Court of Appeals***: Relaxation of rules on redemptioner's failure to pay taxes paid by purchaser.
*   ***Rosales v. Yboa***: Failure to pay delinquent real estate taxes on property will not render redemption void, due to the policy of the law to aid rather than to defeat the right of redemption.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Warranty Clause in the Deed of Sale:** While the Deed warrants that the property is free from lien, the existence of prior mortgage and the attachment would likely have been disclosed or made known by the bank, especially if the parties exercised due diligence.

**Legal Analysis and Potential Arguments:**

*   **Priority of Liens:** Zeonnix's registered attachment takes priority over the Caytons' unregistered Deed of Absolute Sale.  Registration is crucial under PD 1529 for binding third parties. *Garcia v. Court of Appeals* emphasizes the absolute nature of constructive notice.
*   **Validity of Redemption:**  The Caytons challenged the sufficiency of Zeonnix's redemption price.  The Court, citing *Estanislao, Jr. v. Court of Appeals* and *Rosales v. Yboa*, adopted a policy of substantial compliance, forgiving the initial omission of taxes due to the specific circumstances.
*   **Successor-in-Interest vs. Redemptioner:** While the Caytons are successors-in-interest to the Mañoscas, their unregistered interest is subordinate to Zeonnix's registered lien, giving Zeonnix the superior right to redeem.
*   **Cayton’s Due Diligence:** One could argue if the bank warranted in the deed of sale that the property was free of any lien or encumbrance, as this may imply a lack of due diligence on their part.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding Zeonnix's right of redemption.  The ruling emphasizes the importance of registration in property transactions and construes redemption laws liberally in favor of redemptioners. The Caytons' failure to register their interest and the priority of Zeonnix's registered attachment were critical to the outcome.
