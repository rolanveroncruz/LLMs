## Legal Document Summary: *Tokio Marine Malayan Insurance Company Incorporated v. Jorge Valdez*

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 150107 & 150108

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** January 28, 2008

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Tokio Marine Malayan Insurance Company Incorporated (Tokio Marine), Alma Pe√±alosa, Kimio Hosaka, Sumitomi Nishida, Teresita H. Quiambao, and Antonio B. Lapid
*   **Respondent:** Jorge Valdez

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision that dismissed the petitions for certiorari filed by Tokio Marine, thereby upholding the trial court's decision to allow Valdez to litigate as an indigent and rejecting the claim of forum shopping and contempt of court.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Indigency (Rule 3, Sec. 21; Rule 141, Sec. 19):**
    *   *Issue:* Whether the trial court erred in allowing Valdez to litigate as an indigent.
    *   *Holding:* Supreme Court Affirmed the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court reiterated that trial court acquired jurisdiction over the case despite the non-payment of docket fees due to the Order of the Court that plaintiff was allowed to litigate as a pauper. Trial Court correctly applied Section 19, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court by ordering the plaintiff to litigate as a pauper and ruled that his motion was not supported by affidavits of his children. The Court ruled that it is the litigant alone who shall execute the affidavit, not the other members of the immediate family.
    *   *Case Law:* *Magaspi v. Ramolete*, *Manchester Development Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, *Sun Insurance Office Ltd., (SIOL) v. Asuncion*, *Tacay v. Regional Trial Court of Tagum, Davao del Norte*
*   **Forum Shopping (Rule 7, Sec. 5):**
    *   *Issue:* Whether Valdez engaged in forum shopping by failing to disclose pending criminal cases against petitioners in his certificate of non-forum shopping.
    *   *Holding:* Supreme Court Affirmed the Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that the certification was a substantial compliance with Section 5 of Rule 7 as the respondent manifested to the trial court that he filed criminal cases against petitioners with the Office of the City Prosecutor of Makati City. The filing of criminal cases, if disclosed, did not constitute forum shopping as civil and criminal cases do not share the same causes of action.
    *   *Case Law:* *Gatmaytan v. Court of Appeals*, *Mondragon Leisure and Resorts Corp. v. United Coconut Planters Bank*
*   **Contempt of Court (Rule 71, Sec. 3):**
    *   *Issue:* Whether Valdez violated the Court of Appeals' injunction by taking his deposition.
    *   *Holding:* Supreme Court Affirmed the Court of Appeals. The Court ruled that the takig of the deposition of the respondent is not part of the court proceedings in Civil Case No. 98-91356, hence, not covered by the writ of injunction issued by the Court of Appeals. The Court also stated the Courts must exercise their contempt powers sparingly.
    *   *Case Law:* *Heirs of Trinidad De Leon Vda. de Roxas v. Court of Appeals*, *Patricio v. Suplico*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Valdez:** Liable for docket fees as a lien on any judgment in his favor (if he is ultimately not deemed indigent).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Tokio Marine: Risk of ultimately paying a large judgment if Valdez prevails in the underlying suit.
*   Valdez: Risk of being assessed docket fees if his indigent status is successfully challenged later, and potential penalties for false statements regarding his financial status.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of Valdez's "indigent" status and the supporting documentation. Tokio Marine argued against the lack of affidavits from Valdez's children.
*   The scope of the injunction and whether taking Valdez's deposition constituted a violation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petitions, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision.
