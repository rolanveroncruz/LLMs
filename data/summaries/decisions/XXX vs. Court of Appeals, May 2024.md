Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Legal Document Summary: *XXX v. Court of Appeals, People of the Philippines, and AAA***

**Case:** G.R. No. 261459, May 20, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing CA Resolutions directing execution pending appeal of an RTC Decision in a RA 9262 case.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner (XXX) was convicted by the RTC for violation of Section 5(e)(2) of RA 9262 (economic abuse) for depriving his wife (AAA) and child (BBB) of financial support.
*   RTC ordered imprisonment, a fine, mandatory psychological counseling, and monthly support of PHP 15,000.00 plus arrears from March 2013.
*   Petitioner appealed the civil aspect (support) arguing unemployment. Private respondent moved for execution pending appeal regarding the support order.
*   The CA granted execution pending appeal for *future* support payments but denied it for arrears, finding no "good reason" regarding the arrears.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5(e)(2) of RA 9262:** Criminalizes depriving a woman or her children of financial support.
*   **Section 8 of RA 9262:** Allows Protection Orders (POs), including directives to provide support.
*   **Section 22 of RA 9262:** PO provisions apply to criminal cases involving VAWC and impliedly instituted civil actions.
*   **A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC (Rule on Violence Against Women and Their Children):**
    *   **Section 33:** A petition for protection order is deemed instituted with a criminal action unless the offended party reserves the right to institute it separately.
    *   **Section 30:** Judgments granting permanent protection against acts of violence and other reliefs shall be immediately executory
    *   **Section 31:** Appeals from judgments on cases filed under RA 9262 shall not stay the enforcement of the final order or judgment.
*   **Rule 39, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Judgments in actions for injunction, receivership, accounting and support are immediately executory and not stayed by appeal, *unless otherwise ordered by the trial court/appellate court*.
*   **Order for support**: The RTCâ€™s order of support pendente lite is akin to a Protection Order relief and thus falls under immediately executory judgments.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for monthly support payments of PHP 15,000.00 pending appeal, as the CA upheld the execution pending appeal on this point.
*   Potential contempt of court for failure to remit or delay remittance of support, per Section 8(g) of RA 9262.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Petitioner's diminished financial capacity:** Although raised as an argument against the initial support order, the CA's ruling forces payments while the main appeal on the civil aspect is pending.
*   **Rule 39, Section 4, Exception:** The CA, and ultimately the SC, retains discretion to suspend, modify, or restore the award of support on appeal.
*   **Security/Protection of Rights:** Rule 39, Section 4, allows for terms (bond, etc.) for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party if execution is stayed, but it's unclear if such protections are in place here.
*   **Characterization of Civil Liability:** The petitioner argues it is based on a contract, which is not applicable to the present case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004):**  Central statute defining the offense and providing for protection orders.
*   **A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC (Rule on Violence Against Women and Their Children):** Procedural rules governing RA 9262 cases.
*   **Rule 39, Sections 2 & 4, Rules of Court:** Governs execution of judgments, particularly pending appeal.
*   **Villote v. Cangco (G.R. No. 207132 & 207205):**  Confirms the appellate court's discretion under Rule 39, Section 4 to suspend or modify injunctions, even those immediately executory.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   Petitioner argues the CA erred in applying Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court because the provision pertains to judgments in actions for support while the present case involves a judgment for civil liability arising from a criminal offense, but the court ruled in favor of the private respondent, thus rejecting the arguments set forth by the petitioner.
*   Petitioner contests that the amount of support awarded by the RTC was based on a contract, thus he seeks contractual support under Article 208, paragraph 2 of the Family Code.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision to allow execution pending appeal for future support payments. Though the CA incorrectly relied on the "good reason" requirement in Rule 39, Sec. 2, the SC correctly noted that immediate execution is warranted due to the inherent character of the civil liability arising from the VAWC offense and is in line with the provisions of RA 9262, its implementing rules, and Rule 39, Section 4. The petitioner's financial capacity and the ongoing appeal on the civil aspect present potential risks but do not automatically negate the validity of the execution pending appeal.
