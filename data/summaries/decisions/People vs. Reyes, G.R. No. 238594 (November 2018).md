## Legal Document Summary - People v. Reyes y Lagman, G.R. No. 238594

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Joey Reyes y Lagman, G.R. No. 238594 (November 5, 2018)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession), Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Accused-Appellant Reyes. The acquittal was based on a failure by the prosecution to adequately establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically regarding the mandatory witness requirement during the inventory and photography of seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Defines the offenses of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. Requires the prosecution to prove the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty as the corpus delicti.
*   **Chain of Custody Rule (Section 21):** Critically important for establishing the integrity of the seized drug evidence.  The court emphasized that this is a matter of *substantive law*, not merely procedural.  It requires documentation and tracking of the evidence from seizure to court presentation.
*   **Mandatory Witness Rule (Section 21, as amended by RA 10640):** Mandates the presence of an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service *or* the media during the inventory and photography of seized drugs.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a) IRR & RA 10640):** Allows for non-strict compliance with the chain of custody if the prosecution can demonstrate:
    *   Justifiable grounds for non-compliance.
    *   Proper preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.

**Reasoning for Acquittal:**

*   **Failure to Justify Absence of Witnesses:** The prosecution *failed* to adequately explain the absence of an elected public official and a representative from either the DOJ or National Prosecution Service (as mandated by the law effective at the time of the offense) during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs.  The court explicitly stated that the prosecution must prove a justifiable reason for non-compliance; mere silence is not enough.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** The Supreme Court found that the unjustified deviation from the chain of custody rule compromised the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, creating reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strict Application of Chain of Custody:** This case reaffirms the court's commitment to strict compliance with the chain of custody rule in drug cases.
*   **Burden on Prosecution:** The decision underscores the *proactive* duty of the prosecution to justify any lapses in the chain of custody, even if the defense does not raise the issue.  Prosecutors should anticipate challenges and proactively present evidence justifying any deviations from the prescribed procedure.
*   **Witness Availability:** This case reinforces that "mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses, are unacceptable as justified grounds for non-compliance."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision cites numerous cases including: *People v. Crispo, People v. Sanchez, People v. Magsano, People v. Manansala, People v. Miranda, People v. Mamangon, People v. Gamboa, People v. Umipang, People v. Viterbo, People v. AÃ±o, People v. Almorfe, People v. De Guzman, People v. Mamalumpon, People v. Ocfemia, People v. Tumulak, and People v. Rollo.* These cases further clarify the elements of illegal drug offenses and the importance of the chain of custody rule.
*   **People v. Miranda** is highlighted for its emphasis on the State's positive duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody.

**Conclusion:**

This case provides a valuable precedent concerning the critical importance of strict compliance with the chain of custody rule, particularly the mandatory witness requirement, in drug-related offenses under RA 9165.  It emphasizes the prosecution's burden to proactively justify any deviations from the prescribed procedure, highlighting the consequences of failure to do so.  The decision underscores the need for meticulous police work and thorough prosecution in drug cases to ensure the integrity of the evidence and the fairness of the trial.
