**Case:** Adelpha E. Malabed vs. Judge Enrique C. Asis, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2031

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Issue:** Administrative Complaint against Judge Asis for violation of Rule 1.02, Canon I of the Code of Judicial Conduct (exhibiting bias and partiality).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Civil Case:** Complainant, Adelpha Malabed, sued Spouses Cericos for ejectment (Civil Case No. B-1016).  Malabed acquired land; Cericos built on it.
*   **MCTC Decision:**  Favored Malabed (ejectment and damages).
*   **RTC Appeal:**  Judge Asis (Respondent) initially affirmed the MCTC decision.
*   **Petition for Relief:** Spouses Cericos, now represented by Atty. De la Pe単a, filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment.
*   **Crucial Order (August 12, 1999):** Judge Asis GRANTED the Petition for Relief and ordered a new trial, citing Malabed's alleged failure to disclose a prior verbal agreement allowing Cericos to build on the land. This is the crux of the complaint.
*   **CA Decision:**  Malabed appealed via Certiorari. The CA REVERSED Judge Asis's order granting relief, holding that the Petition for Relief was filed out of time (Rule 38 issue) and the alleged fraud wasn't extrinsic. *Garcia v. Court of Appeals (202 SCRA 228)* defines extrinsic vs. intrinsic fraud.
*   **Complainant's Argument:** Judge Asis was biased because Atty. De la Pe単a (Cericos's counsel) also represented Judge Asis in other administrative cases.
*   **Judge Asis's Defense:**  Atty. De la Pe単a wasn't his counsel *at the time* he ruled on the Petition for Relief. He claims that he made a correct verdict based on law and evidence.
*   **OCA Report:** Initially recommended finding Judge Asis liable for gross ignorance of procedural rules for granting an out-of-time Petition for Relief.  Cited *Abbariao vs. Judge Beltran, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1839, 31 August 2005* regarding judges' duty to know basic laws and rules.
*   **Investigating Justice's Report:**  Recommended exoneration, stating that the reversal of a judge's order by a higher court isn't grounds for administrative action *per se*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Duty:** Rule 1.02, Canon I mandates impartial justice without delay.
*   **Bias Standard:**  Mere suspicion of bias is insufficient; clear and convincing evidence is needed. *Opis vs. Judge Dimaano, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1942, 28 July 2005*
*   **Administrative Liability:**  A judge can be held liable for gross ignorance of the law or procedure.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** Absent fraud, dishonesty, or corruption, judges generally are immune from liability for official acts, even erroneous ones. *In re Tayao, 229 SCRA 723*, *Zabala vs. Pamaran, 39 SCRA 430*.
*   **Judicial Ethics:** Judges are expected to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. *Aureo G. Bayaca v. Judge Tranquilino V. Ramos, A.M. No. MTJ-07-1676, January 29, 2009.*

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of Petition for Relief:**  The core procedural issue.  Judge Asis's initial failure to properly apply Rule 38 (60-day period) created the problem.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud:** The CA already determined that the alleged fraud wasn't extrinsic, which should have precluded relief.
*   **Prior Associations:** While the timeline suggests Atty. De la Pe単a wasn't *yet* Judge Asis's counsel when the August 12th order was issued, this is still a problematic relationship potentially creating an appearance of impropriety.
*   **Judge's Discretion:** The argument that CA reversals are not grounds for admin action is a strong one, but it shields judges who may simply have an incorrect interpretation of the law.
*   **Prior Administrative Record:** The Supreme Court emphasized Judge Asis's *prior* administrative penalties in determining the appropriate sanction, indicating that even in cases where impartiality can't be established, a consistent pattern of poor professional conduct may trigger liability.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   While the Court did not find *explicit* bias or partiality, they imposed a FINE of P20,000.00 on Judge Asis, with a stern warning, due to his *prior* history of administrative complaints and sanctions (Tabao v. Judge Asis, Almendra v. Judge Asis, Atty. Nenita Ceniza-Layese v. Judge Enrique C. Asis, Ang v. Judge Asis, Dadizon v. Judge Asis).
* The Court acknowledges that the judge should have been more cautious in his associations with members of the Bar.

**Conclusion:**

The case hinges less on concrete evidence of bias in *this specific instance* and more on Judge Asis's history and the appearance of impropriety stemming from his professional relationships. The penalty is moderate, focusing on the "big picture" of his judicial conduct. The ruling serves as a reminder to judges to diligently follow procedural rules, avoid even the appearance of bias, and comport themselves ethically both on and off the bench.
