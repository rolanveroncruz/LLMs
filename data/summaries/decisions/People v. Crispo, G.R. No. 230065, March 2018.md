## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Crispo and Herrera*, G.R. No. 230065, March 14, 2018

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolving an appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Marcelino Crispo and Enrico Herrera for violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of Republic Act (RA) 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale, trading, delivery, or giving away of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 11, Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody Rule):** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value, including:
    *   Physical inventory and photography of seized items immediately after seizure and confiscation.
    *   Presence of the accused or their representative, a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official.
    *   Signatures of these individuals on the inventory.
    *   Turnover of seized drugs to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **IRR of RA 9165/RA 10640:** Allows for inventory and photography at the nearest police station in instances of warrantless seizure. Provides for the "saving clause" which stipulates that non-compliance with Section 21's requirements, under justifiable grounds, does not necessarily invalidate the seizure if the integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.
*   **Art. 89, Revised Penal Code:** Extinguishment of criminal liability upon the death of the convict.

**Obligations:**

*   **Law Enforcement Officers:** Strict adherence to the chain of custody rule outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165. Must provide justifiable reasons for any deviations and prove preservation of integrity and evidentiary value.
*   **Prosecution:** Burden of proof to establish all elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt, including the identity and integrity of the dangerous drugs. This includes demonstrating compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 or providing justified exceptions.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Herrera:** Criminal liability extinguished due to death pending appeal.
*   **Crispo:** Originally found liable for both Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession under RA 9165. Supreme Court overturned the conviction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The failure to strictly adhere to the chain of custody rule, particularly the absence of representatives from the DOJ and the media, presented a significant risk. The prosecution failed to provide justifiable reasons for this non-compliance, leading to the suppression of evidence and Crispo's acquittal.
*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Justifiable Grounds":**  The "saving clause" creates ambiguity. The courts must critically examine the prosecution's explanation for non-compliance with Section 21 and not presume the existence of justifiable grounds.  Mere statements of unavailability of witnesses are insufficient. Earnest efforts to comply must be demonstrated.
*   **Reliance on Barangay Kagawads:** While the presence of Barangay Kagawads was noted, the absence of DOJ and media representatives rendered their presence insufficient under the strict requirements of RA 9165.
*   **Lack of Coordination:** Testimony indicated a lack of coordination with the DOJ and media representatives prior to the buy-bust operation, suggesting insufficient preparation and disregard for procedural requirements.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165, particularly Section 21)**
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 89**
*   *People v. Jao* (G.R. No. 225634, June 7, 2017): Established that death of the accused pending appeal extinguishes criminal and civil liability (ex delicto).
*   *People v. Mendoza* (736 Phil. 749 (2014)): Stressed the importance of the presence of required witnesses to ensure an unbroken chain of custody.
*   *People v. Almorfe* (631 Phil. 51 (2010)): Prosecution must explain the reasons behind procedural lapses, and integrity of evidence must be preserved.
*   *People v. De Guzman* (630 Phil. 637 (2010)): Justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact.
*   *People v. Umipang* (686 Phil 1024 (2012)): Prosecution must show that earnest efforts were employed in contacting the representatives.
*   *People v. Manansala, G.R. No. 229092, February 21, 2018.*
*   *People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018.*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned Crispo's conviction due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165. The decision underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases and the prosecution's burden to prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt.  It highlights the risk of evidence suppression and acquittal when law enforcement deviates from the prescribed procedures without adequate justification.
