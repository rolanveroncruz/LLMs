**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Vanzuela*, G.R. No. 178266, July 21, 2008 (581 Phil. 211)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order dismissing a criminal case for estafa due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC has jurisdiction over an estafa charge against agricultural tenants stemming from non-payment of lease rentals, and whether agricultural tenants can be held liable for estafa for such non-payment.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the RTC *did* have jurisdiction over the estafa charge, but *denied* the petition because the respondents could not be held liable for Estafa.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC reiterates that RTC jurisdiction is determined by law and the allegations in the Information. The estafa charge, involving P80,000.00, falls under the RTC's criminal jurisdiction based on the amount involved and the penalty prescribed under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).  Critically, the DARAB (Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board) lacks criminal jurisdiction.

*   **Agrarian Dispute:** The RTC erroneously characterized the case as purely an agrarian dispute, thus falling under the DARAB's jurisdiction, citing *David v. Rivera* and *Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals*. The SC distinguishes these cases as relating to *civil* matters (ejectment and annulment of CLOAs) and not criminal prosecutions. The SC recognizes that the DARAB would have jurisdiction over a civil action for collection of lease rentals and/or dispossession of tenants.

*   **Estafa under Art. 315, RPC:** The SC, however, rules that the respondents *cannot* be convicted of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 4, No. 1(b) of the RPC (misappropriation of funds held in trust).  This is because share tenancy, where a tenant holds the landowner's share in trust, has been abolished by RA 3844 and replaced by leasehold tenancy under RA 6657. In leasehold tenancy, the tenant's obligation is to pay rentals, not to deliver a specific *share* of the harvest. Therefore, failure to pay rental does not constitute misappropriation of something held in trust.

*   **Case Law Inapplicability:** *People v. Carulasdulasan and Becarel* and *Embuscado v. People,* where tenants *were* convicted of estafa, are distinguished. *Carulasdulasan* involved *share tenancy* which is no longer relevant. *Embuscado* dealt with procedural due process, not the specific issue of tenant liability under the current tenancy regime.

*   **Equal Protection Argument:** The petitioner's argument that exempting agricultural tenants from estafa prosecution violates the equal protection clause is implicitly rejected, as the decision focuses on the *absence of an element of the crime (trust relationship)* rather than a categorical exemption based on tenant status.

**Obligations:** The key obligation in leasehold tenancy is to pay rentals, as opposed to delivering a specific share.

**Liabilities:** While not liable for estafa for non-payment of lease rentals, tenants may still be subject to civil action for collection of unpaid rentals and potential dispossession proceedings before the DARAB.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discretionary Prosecution:** Landowners retain the right to file estafa charges against tenants, but the SC cautions against doing so without lawful grounds and in pursuit of truth and justice (citing *Re: Conviction of Judge Adoracion G. Angeles*). This creates a risk of malicious prosecution suits if charges are brought without sufficient evidence.

*   **Civil vs. Criminal Overlap:** While the Court addressed the narrow scope of the estafa charge, some ambiguity might remain in fact patterns where an accused is in possession of landowner funds that were entrusted to them.
    
**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 315, paragraph 4, No. 1(b) (Estafa)
*   Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code)
*   Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law/CARL), Sections 50, 56, 57, 73, 74
*   Executive Order No. 229
*   Executive Order No. 129-A
*   DARAB 2003 Rules of Procedure, Rule II, Section 1

**Conclusion:** This decision clarifies that failure to pay lease rentals under a leasehold tenancy agreement cannot be the basis for an estafa charge, due to the absence of a trust relationship required under Article 315 RPC.
