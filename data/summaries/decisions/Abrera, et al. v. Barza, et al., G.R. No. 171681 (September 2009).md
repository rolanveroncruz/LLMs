**Case Summary: *Abrera, et al. v. Barza and CAP Philippines, Inc.* (G.R. No. 171681, Sept. 11, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging the RTC's Orders in a corporate rehabilitation proceeding (Sp. Proc. No. M-6144) involving College Assurance Plan Philippines, Inc. (CAP).

**Key Provisions & Orders Challenged:**

*   **Order dated September 13, 2005:** Stay Order preventing enforcement of all claims against CAP and appointing an Interim Rehabilitation Receiver.
*   **Order dated December 16, 2005:** Gave due course to CAP's petition for corporate rehabilitation.

**Petitioners' Arguments:**

*   Planholders' tuition fee payments are from trust fund assets, not belonging to the debtor and should be excluded from the rehabilitation proceedings.
*   Remaining assets traceable to planholders' funds are held in trust for the beneficiaries.
*   Appointment of Rehabilitation Receiver improper given a prior intracorporate dispute (SEC Case No. 05-365) with a pending application for receivership.
*   The RTC failed to give due respect to findings of a specialized administrative agency (SEC).

**Court's Ruling (Denying the Petition):**

*   The RTC has jurisdiction over corporate rehabilitation petitions under Sec. 2, Rule 3 of the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (2000).
*   The Stay Order under Sec. 6, Rule 4 of the Interim Rules applies to "all claims" against the debtor, and there is no distinction or exemption for claims arising from pre-need contracts or trust relationships.  Cites *Negros Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* to support this.
*   The argument that the planholder-pre-need company relationship is one of trust has not been factually established at the trial court.
*   The pendency of a prior case seeking appointment of a receiver does not preclude the appointment of a Rehabilitation Receiver in the rehabilitation proceedings.
*   The RTC adequately considered the SEC's comments before giving due course to the petition for rehabilitation.

**Key Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 902-A** (as amended by P.D. No. 1758):  Governing corporate rehabilitation and suspension of actions.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8799** (The Securities Regulation Code): Defines "pre-need plans" and transfers SEC's jurisdiction over cases enumerated under Section 5 of P.D. No. 902-A, as amended, to the courts of general jurisdiction or the appropriate Regional Trial Court.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (2000):** Governed the rehabilitation proceedings.
*   **Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation of 2009:** Superseded the Interim Rules but upholds the RTCâ€™s power to issue a Stay Order.
*   ***Negros Navigation Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals:***  Established that P.D. No. 902-A does not distinguish as to which claims are covered by suspension of actions against corporations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Trust vs. Debtor-Creditor Relationship:**  The ruling acknowledges that the planholder-pre-need company relationship could be a trust relationship, but petitioners must prove that relationship at the trial court. Failure to do so weakens their argument for excluding their claims from the Stay Order.
*   **Scope of "All Claims":**  The court's reliance on *Negros Navigation* and the lack of express exemptions in the Interim Rules implies a broad interpretation of "all claims." This leaves open the possibility that even claims arguably secured by trust assets are subject to the Stay Order.
*   **Rehabilitation Receiver's Authority:** While the judgment itself does not explicitly expand the authority of the receiver, the ruling's interpretation of applicable laws could mean broader power is granted in determining the asset pool.
*  **The currentness of laws is potentially a risk.** A lawyer should evaluate all references for their relevance to current statutory law.
*   **The court decision also does not preclude the petitioners from seeking additional remedies at a lower court. The status of these remedies should also be determined.**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the RTC's jurisdiction to grant the Stay Order and give due course to the rehabilitation petition.  The ruling emphasizes a broad interpretation of "all claims" subject to the Stay Order and leaves the onus on the planholders to establish a legally distinct trust relationship to potentially exempt their claims. It is crucial to thoroughly examine the trust agreements and the application of the new Pre-Need Rules to determine if an express trust can be established.
