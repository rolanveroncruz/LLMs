## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 171036

**Case:** *Adela G. Raymundo, et al. vs. Ernesto Lunaria, et al.* (590 Phil. 546)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling in favor of the respondents (real estate agents) for unpaid commission.

**Key Issue:** Whether petitioners (property owners) are liable for the unpaid commission of real estate agents, and the extent of that liability (joint and several vs. pro-indiviso).

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Exclusive Authority to Sell:** A written agreement granted respondents exclusive authority to sell petitioners' property for a 5% commission.
*   **Alleged Subsequent Verbal Agreement:** Petitioners claim a *subsequent* verbal agreement modified the commission sharing, allocating portions to Lourdes Raymundo (for document processing) and the buyer, Hipolito (for realty taxes). The existence and validity of this agreement is the central dispute.
*   **Unpaid Commission:** Respondents claim they received partial payment but were denied the balance based on the alleged verbal agreement.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** The main defense relies on the existence and validity of the verbal agreement.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Respondents, ordering Petitioners to pay the unpaid commission jointly and severally, plus interest, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the trial court's decision, modifying only the amount of moral and exemplary damages.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Obligation:** The original written agreement created an obligation for petitioners to pay the respondents a 5% commission upon successful sale.
*   **Liability:** The RTC and CA found the petitioners jointly and severally liable for the unpaid commission, damages, and fees. This solidary liability means each petitioner is responsible for the entire amount.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Parol Evidence Rule (Applicability):** While the Supreme Court agrees that the parol evidence rule does not apply in the strictest sense (as the verbal agreement allegedly occurred *after* the written one), the failure to *prove* the existence of the subsequent verbal agreement is fatal to petitioners' defense. The evidentiary burden remains on the petitioners to prove the subsequent agreement, which they failed to do. The Court stated that even if the parol evidence rule did apply, petitioners failed to meet the burden of proof necessary to establish the oral agreement.
*   **Proof of Subsequent Modification:** The lack of written evidence corroborating the alleged verbal agreement is a significant weakness for petitioners. The court highlighted the absence of written agreement on the commission sharing scheme.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The most significant risk for petitioners is the finding of joint and several liability. This means each petitioner is individually responsible for the *entire* outstanding amount. This ruling was not challenged by petitioners in their appeal.
*   **Estoppel:** Petitioners are estopped from raising the issue of solidary liability before the Supreme Court because they failed to raise it in their appeal to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Evidence:** The evidence presented by the Petitioners, specifically testimony from Lourdes Raymundo and unilaterally prepared worksheets, were deemed insufficient.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Art. 1207:** Pertains to joint and solidary obligations. Relevant to the dispute over the nature of petitioners' liability.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** General contract law principle addressed but ultimately deemed inapplicable, though the evidentiary requirements for proving a subsequent modification remained.
*   **Roble v. Arbasa, G.R. No. 130707, July 31, 2001:** Cited regarding the application of the Parol Evidence Rule.
*   **Floralde v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 123048, August 8, 2000:** Cited regarding the meaning of "preponderance of evidence."
*   **Ong v. Yap, G.R. No. 146797, February 18, 2005:** Cited regarding the meaning of "preponderance of evidence."
*   **Rudecon Management Corporation v. Camacho, Adm. Case No. 6403, August 31, 2004:** Cited regarding the principle of res judicata and estoppel.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding the petitioners liable for the unpaid commission. The key weakness in their case was the failure to adequately prove the existence of the alleged subsequent verbal agreement. Additionally, their failure to contest the joint and several liability ruling in the Court of Appeals prevented them from raising it before the Supreme Court. The Petitioners' claim was ultimately denied for lack of merit.
