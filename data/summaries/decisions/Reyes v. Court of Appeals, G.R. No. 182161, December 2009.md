## Legal Document Summary: *Reyes v. Court of Appeals, Gonzalez, and Libanan*, G.R. No. 182161

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA decision dismissing a petition for Writ of Amparo.

**Facts:** Petitioner, Fr. Reyes, was arrested during the Manila Peninsula siege and subsequently included in a Hold Departure Order (HDO) issued by the DOJ Secretary at the request of the DILG. An information for rebellion was filed against him, but the RTC dismissed the case for lack of probable cause. Despite the dismissal, the HDO remained active, causing delays and interrogations during the petitioner's international travels.

**Issue:** Whether the continued enforcement of the HDO after the dismissal of the criminal case warrants the issuance of a Writ of Amparo, and whether the DOJ Secretary has the authority to issue HDOs.

**Holding:** Petition dismissed. The CA's decision was affirmed. The Writ of Amparo is not applicable as the facts do not constitute extralegal killing or enforced disappearance (or threats thereof).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **DOJ Circulars 17/1998 & 18/2007:** Respondents argue the DOJ Secretary's authority to issue HDOs stems from these circulars, based on the Administrative Code of 1987.
*   **Rule on Writ of Amparo, Section 1:**  The writ is a remedy for violations of the right to life, liberty, and security resulting from unlawful acts or omissions by public or private actors, specifically addressing extralegal killings and enforced disappearances (or threats thereof).
*   **Rule on Writ of Amparo, Section 22:** When a criminal action is commenced, reliefs under the writ are available by motion in the criminal case, not through a separate petition.

**Liabilities:**

*   The DOJ and its officials could potentially be liable if the HDO was unlawfully issued or enforced.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Constitutionality of DOJ Circulars 17/1998 & 18/2007:**  The petitioner challenges the legality of the DOJ Secretary's authority to issue HDOs based on these circulars.  The Court avoids ruling on the constitutionality, due to the lack of an actual controversy. The circulars have been used for a long time, making it more difficult to challenge due to acceptance of the validity of the circular.
*   **Scope of Writ of Amparo:**  The Court explicitly limits the application of the Writ of Amparo to cases of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances.  The petitioner's argument that it encompasses a broader range of constitutional liberties is rejected.
*   **Availability of Remedies:** The court emphasizes that the dismissal of the criminal charges does not automatically lift the HDO, and the proper recourse is a motion to lift the HDO within the original criminal case pursuant to Section 22 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC (Rule on the Writ of Amparo):**  Defines the scope and application of the Writ of Amparo.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 134 (Rebellion):**  The crime for which the petitioner was initially charged.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987:** Cited as the basis for the DOJ Secretary's authority to issue HDOs.
*   **Secretary of National Defense et al. v. Manalo et al., G.R. No. 180906:** Defines "extralegal killings" and "enforced disappearances" and limits the scope of the Amparo Rule.
*   **Tapuz v. Del Rosario, G.R. No. 182484:** Discusses the nature and purpose of the Writ of Amparo, clarifying it is not intended for commercial or property disputes.
*   **Crespo v. Mogul, G.R. No. L-53373:** Affirms the court's control over a case once a complaint is filed.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of the DOJ Secretary's power to issue HDOs based on Department Circulars without explicit statutory authority remains contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the petition for a Writ of Amparo, reiterating its limited scope to cases of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances. The proper remedy for the petitioner was to file a motion to lift the HDO within the original criminal case. The Court avoided ruling on the constitutionality of the DOJ Secretary's power to issue HDOs based on DOJ circulars, raising concerns about potential abuse of power.
