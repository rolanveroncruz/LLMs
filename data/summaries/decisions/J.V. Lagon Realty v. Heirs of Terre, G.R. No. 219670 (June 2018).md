## Legal Document Summary: J.V. Lagon Realty Corp. v. Heirs of Leocadia Vda. de Terre, G.R. No. 219670 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a DARAB decision concerning illegal ejectment, disturbance compensation, redemption rights, and the existence of a tenancy relationship.

**Key Issue:** Whether a tenancy relationship existed between J.V. Lagon Realty Corp. and Leocadia Vda. de Terre, the alleged tenant.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals and DARAB decisions, finding **no tenancy relationship** existed.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Essential Elements of Tenancy:** The Court reiterates the six essential elements of a tenancy relationship: landowner/tenant, agricultural land, consent, agricultural production purpose, personal cultivation, and harvest sharing. Absence of any element defeats the claim of tenancy. *Nicorp Management and Development Corp. v. De Leon, 585 Phil. 598, 605 (2008).*

*   **Burden of Proof:** The alleged tenant bears the burden of proving all elements of tenancy. *Soliman v. Pasudeco, 607 Phil. 209, 224 (2009).*

*   **Pedral's Affidavit:** The affidavit of the original landowner (Pedral) confirming the initial tenancy arrangement was deemed insufficient because it lacks personal knowledge after he sold the property. He is now "thrice-removed" and cannot attest to the land's condition during J.V. Lagon's ownership.

*   **Lack of Harvest Sharing Evidence:**  Crucially, the Court found **no evidence** of harvest sharing (receipts, testimony, etc.) between the alleged tenant and successive landowners (Abis, Gonzales) or J.V. Lagon. This is fatal to the tenancy claim. *Landicho v. Sia, 596 Phil. 658, 679 (2009); Bejasa v. CA, 390 Phil. 499, 508 (2000).* Self-serving allegations are insufficient. *Berenguer, Jr. v. CA, 247 Phil. 398, 405 ( 1988).*

*   **MARO and Mayor Certifications:** Certifications from administrative agencies (MARO, Municipal Mayor) are considered merely provisional and not binding on the courts. They are only factual determinations, not legal conclusions. The Mayor is also not the proper authority to make this determination. *Soliman v. PASUDECO, 607 Phil. 209, 224 (2009); Automat Realty v. Spouses Dela Cruz, 744 Phil. 731, 744 (2014).*

*   **Non-agricultural Land:** While mentioned, the Court's decision hinges primarily on the lack of tenancy proof, not the land's classification.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   J.V. Lagon Realty Corp. has no obligation to pay disturbance compensation or allow redemption because no tenancy relationship was established.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Heirs of Leocadia Vda. de Terre have lost their claim to tenant rights, redemption, and disturbance compensation.
*   The ruling could embolden landowners to challenge alleged tenancy relationships and rely on technicalities regarding evidence of harvest sharing and administrative certifications.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision prioritizes formal proof of harvest sharing and direct knowledge of the tenancy relationship during the specific period of ownership, potentially overlooking the spirit of agrarian reform and security of tenure.
*   The Dissent argues that the initial establishment of tenancy creates a real right that binds subsequent owners unless legally extinguished, with a clear discussion on the rights and obligations of agricultural leaseholds in the context of successive land transfers, supporting the continuity of the tenurial relationship despite changes in ownership.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code), as amended by R.A. No. 6389: Defines tenancy, redemption, and security of tenure.
*   R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law): Has suppletory application to R.A. 3844.
*   DARAB Rules of Procedure

**Case Law Cited:**

*   Key cases cited establish the six essential elements of tenancy, the burden of proof, the requirement for concrete evidence of harvest sharing (receipts or credible alternatives), and the limited evidentiary value of administrative certifications.
