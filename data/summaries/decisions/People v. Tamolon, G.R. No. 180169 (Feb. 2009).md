## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tamolon and Cabagan*, G.R. No. 180169 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Agustino Tamolon and Antonio Cabagan for Multiple Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Conviction Based on Witness Testimony:** The conviction hinges primarily on the testimony of Modesto Landas, a self-confessed co-conspirator, who implicated the appellants in the massacre.
*   **Credibility Assessment:** The RTC found Landas' testimony credible, and the CA affirmed, citing his straightforward demeanor and detailed account. This finding is given significant weight by the Supreme Court due to the trial court's direct observation of the witness.
*   **Defense of Denial and Alibi Rejected:** The appellants' defenses of denial and alibi were deemed weak and insufficient to overcome the positive testimony of the prosecution witness. The Court reiterated the stringent requirements for alibi to prosper, specifically proving physical impossibility of being at the crime scene (locus criminis).
*   **Penalty:** The appellants were sentenced to multiple terms of *Reclusion Perpetua* for the death of each victim.
*   **Damages:** The CA affirmed the RTC's award of civil indemnity (P50,000.00) to the heirs of each victim and added an award of moral damages (P50,000.00) to the heirs of each victim, recognizing the inherent emotional suffering caused by a violent death, even without specific proof of mental anguish.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Tamolon and Cabagan are criminally liable for Multiple Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil Liability:** They are jointly and severally liable to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the heirs of each victim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Co-conspirator Testimony:** The conviction is primarily based on the testimony of a co-conspirator, which is inherently suspect. While *People v. Cuya, Jr.* (1986) establishes an exception for sincere and detailed testimonies, the weight given to this single source remains a potential point of contention.
*   **Motive of Witness:** The defense questioned the motive of Landas, arguing he testified only after being arrested and promised leniency. This could be argued as raising reasonable doubt regarding Landas' veracity.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 248:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   ***People v. Mateo*:** Established the procedure for automatic review of death penalty cases, resulting in the CA review.
*   ***People v. Cuya, Jr.* (1986):** Addresses the admissibility and weight of co-conspirator testimony.
*   ***People v. Panado*:**  Clarifies the award of moral damages in murder/homicide cases, establishing that emotional suffering of the victim's family is inherent and requires no specific proof.
*   Cites numerous cases regarding the credibility of witnesses (e.g., *People of the Phils. v. Budoy Gonzales y Lacdang, Valcesar Estioca y Macamay v. People of the Phils.*) and the insufficiency of denial and alibi (*People of the Phils. v. Carlito Mateo y Patawid, People v. Fernandez*).

**Concise Summary:**

The *Tamolon and Cabagan* case involves a Multiple Murder conviction based primarily on the testimony of a co-conspirator. The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, emphasizing the trial court's credibility assessment of the witness and rejecting the defenses of denial and alibi. Potential risks revolve around the reliance on a single, potentially motivated witness. The judgment establishes criminal liability under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and civil liability for indemnity and moral damages.
