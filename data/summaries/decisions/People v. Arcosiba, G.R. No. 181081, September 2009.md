**Case Summary: People of the Philippines vs. Roldan Arcosiba (G.R. No. 181081)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction for rape under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353 ("Anti-Rape Law of 1997").

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Rape of a 14-year-old female (AAA) by force and intimidation.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Victim's testimony (AAA) detailing the assault, supported by the testimony of a friend (BBB) and a medical certificate showing old healed hymenal lacerations and erythema. Although there was no evidence of spermatozoa.
*   **Defense:** Denial and alibi.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   RTC: Conviction of rape, sentencing to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering payment of civil indemnity (₱50,000) and moral damages (₱25,000).
    *   CA: Affirmed conviction, modified damages to include exemplary damages (₱25,000).
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the CA decision, upholding the conviction and damage awards. Credited victim's testimony due to its consistency and straightforward nature. Rejected the defense of denial as weak and insufficient to overcome the positive identification by the victim.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant: Liable for *reclusion perpetua*, civil indemnity (₱50,000), moral damages (₱50,000), and exemplary damages (₱25,000).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility Assessment:** The judgment hinges heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony. While the courts found her credible, future challenges could focus on potential biases or inconsistencies, although none are apparent in the provided document.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The absence of spermatozoa could be raised, but the court gave significant weight to victim testimony and the presence of old healed lacerations.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The victim's minority (14 years old) was considered an aggravating circumstance warranting exemplary damages. Article 2230 of the Civil Code was correctly applied.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 266-A and 266-B (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines the crime of rape and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353 ("Anti-Rape Law of 1997"):** Expanded the definition of rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** The Death Penalty Law, which was in force at the time of the RTC decision, but not relevant to the final SC ruling.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2230:** Basis for exemplary damages due to the aggravating circumstance.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Baligod:** Cited to emphasize the importance of the victim's credibility in rape cases, especially when the crime is unwitnessed.

**Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The factual determination hinges heavily on the victim's testimony with limited corroboration. The neighbor saw them on the way to the river but was not a witness to the crime. While corroboration is not always necessary, the fact pattern hinges heavily on her truthfulness.
