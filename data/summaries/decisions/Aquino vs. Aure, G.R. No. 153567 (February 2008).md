## Legal Document Summary: Aquino v. Aure, G.R. No. 153567

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision that reversed the lower courts' dismissal of an ejectment complaint filed by Aure against Aquino. The core issue is the validity of the ejectment suit given the failure to comply with barangay conciliation proceedings and the allegation of ownership which Aquino alleged ousted the MeTC jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Ejectment Suit:** Aure filed an ejectment suit against Aquino based on a Deed of Sale, claiming ownership and right to possess the subject property.
*   **Aquino's Defense:** Aquino claimed the Deed of Sale was governed by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) where Aure was supposed to secure a loan using the property as collateral and remit the proceeds to Aquino, which never occurred. Aquino asserts that the deed of sale was simulated.
*   **Barangay Conciliation:** The MeTC and RTC initially dismissed the case due to non-compliance with barangay conciliation requirements since the parties resided in the same barangay. This was contested on appeal.
*   **Ownership Dispute:** Aquino argued that the issue of ownership, arising from her claim of a simulated Deed of Sale, divests the MeTC of jurisdiction over the ejectment case.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Aure:** Obligation to prove ownership and right to possession based on the Deed of Sale. Potential liability if the Deed of Sale is proven invalid or simulated.
*   **Aquino:** Obligation to vacate the property if Aure's claim is valid. Potential liability for damages due to unlawful possession.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Aure:** Risk of losing the ejectment suit if the Deed of Sale is deemed invalid or simulated.
*   **Aquino:** Risk of being ejected from the property if the Deed of Sale is upheld, irrespective of the underlying MOA.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay Law)/ Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Sec. 412:** Mandates barangay conciliation as a precondition to filing court actions between residents of the same barangay, with specific exceptions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 9, Section 1:** Defenses and objections not pleaded in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived, affecting Aquino's failure to assert the issue in her answer.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 70, Section 1:** Outlines the requirements for an ejectment complaint.
*   **Royales v. Intermediate Appellate Court:** Non-compliance with barangay conciliation is not a jurisdictional defect if not raised seasonably.
*   **Refugia v. Court of Appeals:** Inferior courts have limited jurisdiction to resolve ownership issues in ejectment cases solely to determine possession.
*   **Hilario v. Court of Appeals:** Any adjudication on ownership in an ejectment case is provisional and does not bar a separate action for title.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1508, Section 6:** Non-compliance with conciliation precondition to filing of complaint.
*   **People v. Caruncho, Jr., Galuba v. Laureta, Morata v. Go:** Cases affirming the compulsory nature of the conciliation process and the underlying principle of voluntary out-of-court settlement.
*   **Uy v. Contreras:** Case establishing failure to comply with conciliation results in pre-maturity of the complaint.
*   **Presco v. Court of Appeals:** Case establishing that non-compliance does not affect the jurisdiction of the court acquired over the subject matter.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Deed of Sale vs. the MOA:** The document leaves unclear the legal impact of the MOA. Is it a condition precedent that vitiates the Deed of Sale?
*   **Effect of ownership assertion in an ejectment case:** The extent to which the MeTC can adjudicate ownership issues remains a point of contention.

**Decision:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition and AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals' decision. The court held that (1) non-compliance with barangay conciliation is not a jurisdictional flaw and Aquino waived her right to raise the issue by not asserting it in her Answer; and (2) that the MeTC has the competence to resolve the issue of ownership to determine the issue of possession.
