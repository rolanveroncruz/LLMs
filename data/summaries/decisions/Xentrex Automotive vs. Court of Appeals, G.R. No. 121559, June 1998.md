**Case Summary: Xentrex Automotive, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 121559, June 18, 1998**

**Facts:** Private respondents (Samsons) sought to purchase a car from petitioner (Xentrex). The Samsons made partial payments totaling P250,000.00 towards the purchase price of P494,000.00 for a 1991 Nissan Sentra Super Saloon A/T.  Xentrex subsequently sold the car to another buyer without the Samsons' knowledge. The Samsons sued for breach of contract and damages.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision that Xentrex breached a perfected contract of sale, relying on Article 1475 of the Civil Code. The SC held that a contract of sale was perfected when there was a meeting of the minds on the thing and the price, evidenced by Xentrex accepting the initial deposit and designating a specific vehicle.  This created a reciprocal obligation to deliver the car upon full payment.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Perfected Contract of Sale (Art. 1475, Civil Code):**  A contract of sale exists upon meeting of the minds regarding the object (the car) and the price. This imposes an obligation on the seller (Xentrex) to deliver the car and on the buyer (Samsons) to pay the remaining balance.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Xentrex breached the contract by selling the car to another party before delivering it to the Samsons.
*   **Damages:** The original lower courts awarded Moral, Nominal and Exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. SC modified this:

    *   **Moral Damages (Art. 2217, Civil Code):** Upheld, but reduced from P100,000.00 to P10,000.00, based on MacArthur Samson's testimony of shock and embarrassment. Cited *Tan vs. Court of Appeals* and *American Express International, Inc. vs. IAC* regarding entitlement to moral damages for negligence causing mental anguish.
    *   **Nominal Damages:** Deleted, as the factual basis was not established.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** Deleted, as there was no showing of wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent conduct by Xentrex. Cited *LBC Express, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,* *Pilipinas Bank vs. Court of Appeals,* and *Filinvest Credit Corporation vs. Court of Appeals.*
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Reduced to P10,000.00.
    *   **Reimbursement of Advance Payment:** Upheld at P250,000.00, plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint.

**Liabilities:** Xentrex is liable for:

*   Reimbursing the Samsons P250,000.00 with legal interest.
*   Moral damages of P10,000.00.
*   Attorney's fees of P10,000.00.
*   Litigation expenses of P6,000.00.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Quantification of Moral Damages:**  Moral damages are inherently subjective.  While reduced, the basis for the final P10,000.00 amount is somewhat discretionary.
*   **Lack of Bad Faith:** The SC explicitly states Xentrex was not in bad faith. Therefore, future claims by the Samsons based on bad faith are unlikely to succeed, but the finding does not preclude a finding of negligence.
*   **Interest Rate:** The SC did not specify the interest rate. This will likely be the legal interest rate at the time of judgment, according to the Civil Code.
*   **Third-Party Sale:** The facts do not specify if Xentrex profited from selling the car to a third party; only that the third party purchase occurred.
