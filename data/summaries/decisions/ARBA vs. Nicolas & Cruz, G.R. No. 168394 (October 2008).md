Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association (ARBA) v. Nicolas and Cruz*, G.R. No. 168394, October 6, 2008:

**Case Summary: *Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Association (ARBA) v. Nicolas and Cruz***

**Facts:** The case involves a dispute over land in Davao City, originally owned by PhilBanking.  DAR issued a notice of coverage under CARP (RA 6657). PhilBanking protested. Despite the protest, DAR transferred ownership to the Republic and distributed it to ARBA members under a CLOA (TCT No. CL-143). PhilBanking assigned its rights to Nicolas and Cruz, who filed a complaint with DARAB seeking CLOA cancellation and reinstatement of PhilBanking's titles (TCT Nos. 162077 & 162078).

**Issue:** Whether the subject parcels of land are exempt from CARP coverage due to prior reclassification as urban/urbanizing zones. A subsidiary issue is whether respondents (Nicolas and Cruz) have a valid cause of action as assignees of PhilBanking.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which reinstated the DARAB (Tagum) decision declaring the land exempt from CARP. The SC held that the land had been reclassified as urban by Davao City Ordinance No. 363, Series of 1982 and approved by the HLURB, *prior* to RA 6657's effectivity (June 15, 1988).  Applying the doctrine in *Natalia Realty, Inc. v. Department of Agrarian Reform*, G.R. No. 103302, August 12, 1993, 225 SCRA 278, land already classified as non-agricultural before the effectivity of CARP is outside its coverage.

**Key Provisions & Legal Principles:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law/CARL):**  Governs the acquisition and distribution of agricultural land to qualified beneficiaries.  Section 3(c) defines "agricultural land." Section 54 relates to DARAB decisions and the finality of its findings of fact, contingent on substantial evidence.
*   **Exemption from CARP:** Land reclassified as non-agricultural *before* June 15, 1988, is generally exempt.
*   **Local Autonomy Act of 1959 (RA 2264):**  Empowers municipal and city councils to adopt zoning ordinances.
*   ***Natalia Realty, Inc. v. DAR* Doctrine:**  Land converted to non-agricultural use with government approval (e.g., HLURB approval of zoning ordinances) prior to RA 6657 is not subject to CARP.
*   **Assignees' Rights:** Nicolas and Cruz, as assignees of PhilBanking, have a valid cause of action to pursue the claim.
*   **Substantial Evidence Rule:** DARAB findings of fact must be supported by substantial evidence to be considered final and conclusive.
*   **DOJ Opinion No. 44, Series of 1990** supports the ruling that DAR’s authority to reclassify land applies only after the effectivity of RA 6657

**Obligations:**

*   Register of Deeds of Davao City is obligated to cancel TCT No. CL-143 and reinstate TCT Nos. 162077 & 162078.
*   ARBA members must respect the landowners’ rights subject to qualification that tenants, who were tenants prior to June 15, 1988, must be respected

**Liabilities:**

*   ARBA is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The key issue is whether the reclassification occurred *before* June 15, 1988, and whether it was properly approved by HLURB (or its predecessor). Any challenge to the validity or timing of the reclassification could revive the CARP coverage issue.
*   **Tenant Rights:** The CA decision maintains ARBA members' rights to peaceful possession *if* they (or their predecessors-in-interest) were tenants before June 15, 1988.  This creates potential for future disputes regarding tenant status and security of tenure under existing tenancy laws (RA 1199 and RA 3844). The SC did not expound on this so its exact implication needs further analysis.
*   **Lack of Due Process:** The respondents raised the issue of being deprived of due process which the DARAB did not give credence to.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's decision regarding tenants' rights.
*   The DARAB decision to order the ARBA to choose and exercise the compensation package offered by the petitioners.
*   The DARAB decision to order the ARBA to vacate possession in the land.
