**Case Summary: *Sorongon v. Gargantos, Sr.*, A.C. No. 11326, June 27, 2018**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Ramon Y. Gargantos, Sr. initiated by complainant Pelagio Vicencio Sorongon, Jr. for alleged violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), specifically Canon 16 and Rule 16.01.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Engagement & Fees:** Complainant alleges payment of P200,000 to Respondent for legal services in Sandiganbayan cases involving violation of RA 3019 Section 3(e). No formal MOA or receipt issued.
*   **Demand for "Pocket Money" & Abandonment:** Respondent allegedly demanded additional funds ("pocket money") prior to a hearing and threatened to abandon the case and falsely accuse the complainant if he did not comply. He subsequently withdrew as counsel on the day of the hearing.
*   **Failure to Account & Return Documents:**  Complainant alleges that Respondent failed to return case documents despite demand.
*   **Violation of Canon 16, Rule 16.01:** Failure to account for client's money and hold it in trust.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's Duty:** To act ethically, diligently, and in the best interests of the client. Failure to account for money and return documents is a breach. Abandonment of client without good cause is a violation of the CPR.
*   **IBP's Duty:** Investigate complaints against lawyers and make recommendations to the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Formal Agreement:** The absence of a written MOA makes it difficult to definitively ascertain the scope of services covered by the initial fee. This affects the determination of what constitutes a "reasonable" attorney's fee and the validity of the claim for a full refund.
*   **Proof of Demand:** The complainant alleges making a demand for the return of the documents. Lack of documentation confirming the demand could be a contentious issue.
*   **Quantum of Attorney's Fees:** Determination of reasonable attorney's fees hinges on evidence of services rendered and industry standards. The IBP lowered the recommended penalty due to respondent's age and first time offence.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act - the underlying legal basis for the criminal charges against the complainant.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 16 & Rule 16.01:**  Governs a lawyer's duty to account for client funds and property.
*   **Bar Matter No. 1755 & A.M. No. 11-9-4-SC:** Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Bar Discipline.
*   **Relevant Case Law regarding Mitigating Factors:** *The Office of the Court Administrator v. Egipto, Jr.*, A.M. No. P-05-1938, January 30, 2018 (citing *Arganosa-Maniego v. Salinas*, 608 Phil. 334 (2009); *Tolentino v. Mangapit*, 209 Phil. 607 (1983)) - This case and the cited cases indicate that the Court may consider mitigating factors such as age and first time offence when determining penalties.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court suspended Atty. Gargantos for six (6) months and ordered him to return P200,000 to the complainant and to return all documents in his possession pertaining to the client's case. This was a lesser penalty then requested by the CBD.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   A focus on equitable considerations due to the attorney's advanced age and lack of prior disciplinary record may allow for a further mitigation of penalties.
*   Challenging the amount of money that was paid or received if any doubt about the money paid.
