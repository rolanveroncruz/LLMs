**Case Summary: People v. Bacus, G.R. No. 181744, October 2, 2009 (617 Phil. 846)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Rape.

**Key Issue:** Credibility of the complainant's (AAA) testimony regarding the alleged rape committed by the appellant (Roy Bacus).

**Facts (Prosecution):**

*   AAA alleged that Bacus, an acquaintance, raped her at knifepoint under a cargo truck on February 3, 1999.
*   She claimed Bacus grabbed her, threatened her with a knife, and forcibly had intercourse with her under a parked truck.
*   Medico-legal examination revealed healed lacerations but no fresh bleeding or external injuries.

**Facts (Defense):**

*   Bacus admitted to intercourse with AAA, but claimed it occurred on February 2, 1999, with her consent as they were sweethearts.
*   He alleged that AAA was intoxicated and sought money from him on the 3rd.
*   He raised the implausibility of rape occurring under the truck given its limited space.
*   Presented photo (Exhibit "1") of truck.

**RTC Ruling:** Convicted Bacus of Rape and sentenced him to Reclusion Perpetua, ordering him to pay Php 50,000 in moral damages and costs.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision but modified it to add Php 50,000 civil indemnity to the moral damages.

**SC Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision and acquitted Bacus based on reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   Criminal liability for Rape under the Revised Penal Code.
*   Obligation of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   Obligation of the court to exercise extreme vigilance in examining the complainant's testimony in rape cases (People v. Espino, Jr., G.R. No. 176742, June 17, 2008).

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   Initially, the RTC imposed Reclusion Perpetua and ordered Bacus to pay Php 50,000 in moral damages.
*   The CA added a civil indemnity of Php 50,000.
*   However, the Supreme Court acquitted Bacus, eliminating all liabilities.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The absence of fresh bleeding, lack of external injuries on AAA, and healed lacerations of the medico legal report questioned the veracity of the crime.
*   **Implausibility of the Location:** The Supreme Court questioned whether forced intercourse was possible in the described location, based on the exhibit (Exhibit "1" - the truck).
*   **Credibility of Testimony:** The core issue revolved around the credibility of the complainant's testimony, which the Supreme Court found insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (Rape).
*   Rules on Criminal Procedure.
*   *People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004:* Defines appellate review process for cases with severe penalties.
*   *People v. Espino, Jr., G.R. No. 176742, June 17, 2008:* Addresses need for vigilance in rape case testimony.
*    *People v. Malibiran, G.R. No. 173471, March 17, 2009:* Addresses credibility of Rape victim accounts.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The medico-legal findings indicated healed lacerations and no fresh bleeding, raising questions about the timing and nature of the sexual act.
*   The description of the location (under a truck) and its physical characteristics (stone-lined ground, limited space) cast doubt on the feasibility of the alleged rape.

**Summary for Legal Counsel:**

This is a rape case where the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts' conviction due to reasonable doubt.  The prosecution's case hinged heavily on the complainant's testimony, but the Court found it insufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt given the lack of corroborating physical evidence and the implausibility of the alleged location. Key challenges include the lack of external injuries, the medical findings indicating a timeframe inconsistent with the alleged rape, and the confined space under the truck, as highlighted in exhibit "1", which questions the possibility of forced intercourse. This case underscores the need for strong, credible evidence in rape cases, especially where the only direct evidence is the complainant's testimony.  *Espino* and *Malibiran* were referenced to remind the lower courts to make a thorough investigation.
