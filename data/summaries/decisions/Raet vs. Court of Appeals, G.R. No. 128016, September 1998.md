**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Cesar and Elvira Raet and Spouses Rex and Edna Mitra v. Court of Appeals, Phil-Ville Development & Housing Corporation, Geronima G. Que and Carolina Q. Villongco*, G.R. No. 128016, September 17, 1998 (356 Phil. 979)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision that reversed the Office of the President's ruling, which had sustained the HLURB Arbiter's decision in favor of petitioners in a specific performance and damages claim against PVDHC.

**Key Issue:** Whether there were perfected contracts of sale between the petitioners (Raet and Mitra spouses) and private respondent PVDHC for units in Las Villas de Sto. Ni√±o Subdivision. Whether prior ejectment case bars the HLURB action for specific performance.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Lack of Perfected Contracts:** The Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the Court of Appeals, finding that no perfected contracts of sale existed due to a lack of meeting of the minds on essential terms, particularly the price.
*   **Amparo Gatus' Role:** Gatus was not an agent of PVDHC. Art. 1874 of the Civil Code requires written authorization for agents selling land. This lack of written authority invalidates any purported sale by Gatus on behalf of PVDHC.
*   **GSIS Loan Condition:** The intended agreements were contingent on GSIS loan approvals, which did not materialize.
*   **Ejectment Suit vs. HLURB Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court acknowledged that the decision in the ejectment case is conclusive *only* on the issue of possession *de facto*, per Section 7, Rule 70, Rules of Court. It does *not* bar the HLURB from determining whether there was a perfected contract of sale. The HLURB has exclusive jurisdiction over cases of specific performance and unsound real estate business practices under E.O. 648, as amended by E.O. 90.
*   **Occupation by Forbearance:** Petitioners' occupation of the units was solely due to PVDHC's forbearance and doesn't create a legal right.

**Obligations:**

*   There are *no* contractual obligations on PVDHC to sell the units to Petitioners, as no valid contracts existed.
*   Gatus was initially ordered by the HLURB to remit payments to PVHDC. This was reversed by the Court of Appeals.
*   Petitioners are obligated to vacate the property because their possessory rights from the original ejectment case were already upheld in the previous ruling by the Municipal Trial Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   PVDHC is *not* liable to Petitioners for specific performance or damages based on a breach of contract, as no contract was perfected.
*   Gatus potentially liable to Petitioners for refund of payments, but this issue was not directly resolved in this decision (remanded to the Office of the President).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Gatus' Liability:** The ruling does not definitively resolve Gatus' potential liability to petitioners for a refund of payments made to her. The case was dismissed without prejudice, giving petitioners the right to proceed against Gatus.
*   **"Without Prejudice" Clause:** The CA's dismissal "without prejudice" to petitioners' right to proceed against Gatus is a point of concern for PVDHC. Though not directly liable, future actions against Gatus could indirectly affect them or raise related claims.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1874, Civil Code:** Requires written authority for agents selling land.
*   **Section 7, Rule 70, Rules of Court:** Limits the conclusiveness of judgments in ejectment cases to possession de facto.
*   **E.O. 648, as amended by E.O. 90:** Defines the HLURB's exclusive jurisdiction over real estate disputes, including specific performance.
*   *Tejada v. Homestead Property Corporation, 178 SCRA 164 (1989):* Affirms HLURB's jurisdiction includes determining the existence of perfected contracts.

**Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly identified. The core contentions revolved around the existence of a perfected contract and the authority of Gatus.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding that no perfected contracts of sale existed between the petitioners and PVDHC. This eliminates any obligation on PVDHC's part to convey the properties.
