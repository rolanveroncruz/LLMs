**Case Summary: *Jun Mupas and Gil Mupas vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 172834)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether Petitioners Jun and Gil Mupas were correctly convicted of Frustrated Homicide.

**Facts:** Rogelio Murao alleged Jun and Gil Mupas attacked him. The RTC convicted them of Frustrated Homicide. The CA affirmed with modification (temperate damages). The Supreme Court reviewed.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted the petition in part, modifying the CA decision. Jun Mupas was found guilty only of Less Serious Physical Injuries (Art. 265, RPC). Gil Mupas was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Art. 265: Less Serious Physical Injuries - Jun Mupas was ultimately convicted under this article.
    *   Previous Charge under Art. 249 (Frustrated Homicide) was deemed not proven.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Insufficient evidence to prove intent to kill, a necessary element of Frustrated Homicide.
    *   Lack of corroboration for Rogelio's testimony concerning Gil Mupas's participation.
    *   Prosecution failed to present readily available witnesses to support Rogelio's version of events.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Temperate damages of P4,000.00 affirmed.
    *   Moral damages of P5,000.00 awarded due to injuries suffered.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Jun Mupas:** Criminally liable for Less Serious Physical Injuries; civilly liable for temperate and moral damages.
*   **Gil Mupas:** No criminal or civil liability.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The court found the victim's testimony to be unreliable due to lack of corroboration and failure to present other available witnesses.
*   **"Banjo" Identity:** The CA addressed the identity issue of Gil Mupas being the same person as alias "Banjo". The Court ruled that despite this, the prosecution still had to prove Gil's culpability, which they failed to do.
*   **Intent to Kill:** The critical element of "intent to kill" for the initial Frustrated Homicide charge was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. The wounds were deemed superficial and not indicative of a homicidal intent.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 6 (Stages of crimes), Art. 249 (Homicide), Art. 265 (Less Serious Physical Injuries)
*   Civil Code: Art. 2219 (Moral Damages)

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Uy*, 392 Phil. 773 (2000) (Presumption of innocence)
*   *United States v. Sy Quingco and De Jesus*, 16 Phil. 418 (1910) (Sufficiency of one witness)
*   *Aradillos v. Court of Appeals*, 464 Phil. 650 (2004) (Intent to Kill)
*   *People v. Pagador*, 409 Phil. 338 (2001) (Intent to Kill and Physical Injuries)
*   *People v. Vicente*, 423 Phil. 1065 (2001) (Lesser included offense)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

* The main point of contention was whether the prosecution proved intent to kill, which is a key element of the charge, and the court found that they did not prove this beyond a reasonable doubt, leading to the downgrading of the charge.
* Identification of Gil Mupas, although the CA did not find fault in the ID process, the SC found the evidence against him insufficient.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of proving each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Lack of corroboration, questionable witness credibility, and failure to establish intent to kill can result in a reversal or modification of a conviction.
