**Case Summary: *Cordora v. COMELEC and Tambunting*, G.R. No. 176947 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus assailing COMELEC Resolutions dismissing an election offense complaint.

**Facts:** Cordora accused Tambunting of violating Section 74 (Contents of Certificate of Candidacy) in relation to Section 262 (Election Offenses) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). Cordora alleged Tambunting made false statements in his Certificates of Candidacy (CoC) regarding citizenship and residency. Cordora argued Tambunting was an American citizen due to claiming American citizenship in immigration records, and thus ineligible and made false statements in his CoC. Tambunting presented his birth certificate showing a Filipino mother and asserted his dual citizenship by birth, and that he did not naturalize as an American citizen. He also claimed residency from birth in the Philippines and oath under RA 9225.

**COMELEC Ruling:** COMELEC En Banc dismissed Cordora's complaint for insufficient evidence to establish probable cause, affirming the COMELEC Law Department's findings. Commissioner Sarmiento noted Tambunting's possible dual citizenship.

**Issue:** Did the COMELEC commit grave abuse of discretion in finding no probable cause to prosecute Tambunting for making false statements in his CoC?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The Petition was DISMISSED.

**Key Provisions/Statutes:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code, Sec. 74:** Requires candidates to state eligibility for office and other factual matters in their CoC.
*   **Omnibus Election Code, Sec. 262:** Defines violations of Section 74, among others, as election offenses.
*   **R.A. No. 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003):** Allows natural-born Filipinos who have become naturalized citizens of another country to retain or reacquire Filipino citizenship by taking an oath of allegiance.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Candidates must make truthful statements in their CoCs (Sec. 74, OEC).
*   Failing to do so constitutes an election offense (Sec. 262, OEC), potentially leading to prosecution.
*   Persons with dual citizenship who were natural born Filipinos do not need to renounce their foreign citizenship to run for public office, swearing to the oath of allegiance is enough.
* Naturalized citizens who reacquire Filipino citizenship under RA 9225 and desire to run for office must make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case hinges on the distinction between *dual citizenship* (involuntary, arising from birth) and *dual allegiance* (voluntary, resulting from naturalization or other positive act).
*   The ruling clarifies requirements for dual citizens from birth versus naturalized citizens desiring to run for public office, but interpretation regarding specific actions demonstrating allegiance (beyond possessing a foreign passport) remains potentially ambiguous.
*   There is no dual allegiance by Tambunting, which would require explicit renunciation of foreign citizenship.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Mercado v. Manzano*** **(1999):** Dual citizenship is not a ground for disqualification from running for any elective local position. Election of Philippine citizenship by filing CoC suffices.
*   ***Valles v. COMELEC*** **(2000):** Reiterates *Mercado* on dual citizenship vs. dual allegiance.
*   ***AASJS v. Datumanong*** **(2007):** Discusses RA 9225 and the oath of allegiance as an implicit renunciation.
*   ***Jacot v. Dal and COMELEC*** **(2008), Velasco v. COMELEC (2008), and Japzon v. COMELEC (2009):** Relate to natural-born Filipinos who later naturalized in another country and had to comply with the requirements of swearing to an Oath of Allegiance and executing a Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship
*   **Kilosbayan, Inc. v. COMELEC (1997):** defines probable cause

**Legal Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case is favorable for clients in similar situations of dual citizenship by birth. The Court explicitly distinguishes *Mercado v. Manzano* and *Valles v. COMELEC* from cases involving *naturalized* citizens covered by R.A. No. 9225. The critical factor is that Tambunting did not *naturalize* as a US citizen; his American citizenship arose from his birth circumstances. Therefore, he was not required to execute a formal renunciation of foreign citizenship. The main risk lies in proving that the client's dual citizenship *arose from birth* (jus sanguinis or jus soli), not from a subsequent act of naturalization. Ensure meticulous documentation of birth circumstances.
