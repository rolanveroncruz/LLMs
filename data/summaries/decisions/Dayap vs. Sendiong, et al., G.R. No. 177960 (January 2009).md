## Legal Document Summary: *Dayap v. Sendiong et al.* G.R. No. 177960, January 29, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision regarding jurisdiction and civil liability in a reckless imprudence case.

**Facts:** Petitioner Dayap was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, less serious physical injuries, and damage to property under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).  The MTC granted Dayap's demurrer to evidence, acquitting him due to insufficiency of evidence. The RTC affirmed the acquittal but remanded the civil aspect for further proceedings. The CA reversed, holding that the RTC, not the MTC, had jurisdiction, and ordered remand for proper disposition of the merits.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:**  The central issue is which court, MTC or RTC, had jurisdiction over the offense. The CA based jurisdiction on the alleged amount of civil damages (P1,500,000) and an abandoned attempt to amend the information alleging 'abandonment' by the driver.. The Supreme Court (SC) relied on  Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7691 amending Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, which confers jurisdiction on first-level courts (MTC) for offenses punishable with imprisonment not exceeding six years and, specifically, for offenses involving damage to property through criminal negligence. The imposable penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide, less serious physical injuries, and damage to property, a complex crime under Art. 48 of the RPC, falls within the MTC's jurisdiction. SC used case law here too by citing *Venancio Figueroa y Cervantes v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 147406, 14 July 2008 which states "that in offenses involving damage to property through criminal negligence, they shall have exclusive original jurisdiction thereof.‚Äù

*   **Demurrer to Evidence and Double Jeopardy:**  The SC acknowledges that the grant of a demurrer to evidence resulting in acquittal is not appealable due to double jeopardy concerns (*People v. Sandiganbayan*, 488 Phil. 293, 310 (2004)). Review is limited to certiorari under Rule 65, requiring a showing of grave abuse of discretion (*People v. Uy*, G.R. No. 158157, 30 September 2005, 471 SCRA 668).

*   **Civil Liability:** The SC clarifies the effect of acquittal on civil liability. While extinction of penal action *generally* doesn't automatically extinguish civil liability, it *does* where the acquittal is based on a finding that the act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did not exist, or that the accused did not commit the act (*Salazar v. People*, 458 Phil. 504 (2003)). The MTC's finding in this case explicitly stated no crime was proven and the accused was not responsible, thereby extinguishing the civil liability.

**Holding:**

The SC granted the petition, reversed the CA decision, and reinstated the MTC order acquitting Dayap. It held that the MTC had jurisdiction, the acquittal was justified based on the prosecution's failure to prove the crime, and Dayap's acquittal extinguished his civil liability because the MTC found that the acts giving rise to liability did not exist.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The attempt to introduce 'abandonment' as an aggravating circumstance. While ultimately unsuccessful, it demonstrates a potential argument for a higher degree of culpability and potentially increased civil damages if the initial Information were amended and successfully proven.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Cuyos v. Garcia* (No. L-46934, 15 April 1998) - Cited by CA regarding jurisdiction in complex crimes (though cited incorrectly as *Tulor v. Garcia*). However, the SC disagreed with the CA's application.
*   *People v. de los Santos*, 407 Phil. 724 (2001) -  Discusses complex crimes under Art. 48 and its application to crimes of negligence.
