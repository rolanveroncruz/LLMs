## Legal Document Summary: Teoco vs. Metrobank (G.R. No. 162333)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that reversed the RTC's dismissal of Metrobank's petition for writ of possession over foreclosed properties.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Bienvenido and Juan Teoco, Jr. (brothers), successors-in-interest of the original mortgagors.
*   **Respondent:** Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), mortgagee and purchaser at foreclosure sale.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Redemption:** The core issue is whether the Teoco brothers validly redeemed the foreclosed properties. The SC held that the brothers Teoco could redeem the foreclosed properties based on the foreclosure price plus interest (P255,441.14 plus interest), but such redemption would be without prejudice to Metrobank's right to subsequently foreclose on the same properties to satisfy other loans, *provided* Metrobank proves those subsequent loans were covered by the original mortgage.

2.  **Sufficiency of Redemption Price:** Metrobank argued that the tendered amount was insufficient, claiming the Co spouses owed additional sums beyond the original P200,000 loan. The SC held that Metrobank failed to prove that subsequent obligations were secured by the initial mortgage. Metrobank relied on a clause stating the mortgage secured "those that may hereafter be obtained," but provided no evidence that the subsequent loans specifically incorporated this clause.

3.  **Transfer of Right of Redemption:** Metrobank contested the validity of the assignment of the right of redemption from the Co spouses to the Teoco brothers, arguing that the Teocos were not explicitly named in the document and that it lacked proper authentication. The Court rejected this, finding:
    *   The Teocos were the brothers of the registered property owner.
    *   Metrobank did not challenge the content or genuineness of the assignment, which was taken as an implied admission.
    *   Non-compliance with Art. 1358 of the Civil Code (requiring public instrument for real rights transfers) only provides the right to compel execution of a public document, it doesn't invalidate the agreement.
    *   Metrobank would not be prejudiced by the assignment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135:** Extrajudicial foreclosure law.
*   **Act No. 4118:** Amendment to Act No. 3135.
*   **General Banking Act (Section 78):** Governs redemption rights.
*   **Civil Code Articles 1357 & 1358**: Form of Contracts relating to land and the right to compel execution of documents
*   **Civil Code Articles 1625**: Governs the right of a creditor to pursue a mortgaged property into the hands of third persons.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Mojica v. Court of Appeals, 201 SCRA 517 (1991):**  Cited by Metrobank regarding mortgages securing future advancements. The SC distinguished this case, emphasizing that such clauses don't automatically cover all subsequent loans and must be specifically proven.
*   **Lopez v. Court of Appeals, 156 SCRA 838:** Discussed admissibility of foreign notarized documents.
*   **Cenido v. Apacionado, 318 SCRA 688**
*   **Co v. Philippine National Bank, 114 SCRA 842**
*   **Ansaldo v. Court of Appeals, 177 SCRA 8**
*   **Halili v. Court of Industrial Relations, 257 SCRA 174**
*   **China Banking Corporation v. Ordinario, 399 SCRA 430**
*   **Cenas v. Santos , 204 SCRA 53**

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank:** Obligated to allow redemption by the Teoco brothers based on the foreclosure price plus interest. Retains the right to foreclose again to satisfy other covered obligations (contingent on proving those obligations are indeed covered by the mortgage).
*   **Teoco Brothers:** Liable to pay the redemption price (foreclosure price plus interest) to effectively redeem the property.
*   **Co Spouses:** Remain primarily liable for their outstanding loan obligations to Metrobank.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Future Advancements" Clause:**  The success of Metrobank's subsequent foreclosure hinges on proving that the "future advancements" clause in the mortgage contract actually covers the specific loans in question. Lack of documentation or clear agreement could lead to a challenge.
*   **Potential for Litigation:** The decision opens the door for potential litigation regarding the scope and validity of the subsequent foreclosure action by Metrobank.

**Conclusion:**

The SC reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC's decision, but *modified* it. The Teoco brothers can redeem, but Metrobank retains the right to foreclose again for other covered loans. The key takeaway is the need for clear documentation and evidence when relying on "future advancements" clauses in mortgage contracts. This case serves as a warning to banks to meticulously document and specifically tie subsequent loan agreements to the original mortgage to avoid challenges during foreclosure proceedings. The ruling underscores that the right of redemption should be liberally construed in favor of the debtor.
