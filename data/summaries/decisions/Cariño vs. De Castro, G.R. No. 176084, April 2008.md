**Case Summary: Cariño v. De Castro, G.R. No. 176084 (April 30, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision dismissing a petition for review of Regional Trial Court's (RTC) affirmance of Metropolitan Trial Court's (MTC) dismissal of BP 22 charges.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **BP 22 Charges:** Petitioner Carmencita Cariño filed BP 22 charges against Respondent Merlin de Castro.
*   **MTC Dismissal:** MTC dismissed the charges, finding no probable cause because checks were issued without valuable consideration, as Petitioner allegedly lacked authorization to collect rent (based on affidavits from property owners).
*   **RTC Affirmance:** RTC affirmed the MTC decision, citing Petitioner's failure to rebut the owners' affidavits.
*   **CA Dismissal:** CA dismissed Petitioner's Petition for Review because it was filed by the private prosecutor (with Assistant City Prosecutor's conformity) and not by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), as mandated by law. Cites Sec. 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III of Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code.
*   **OSG Comment:** The OSG filed a comment agreeing with the CA's decision, stating that the private prosecutor lacked the authority to file the appeal and that there were no new and substantial matters to warrant a re-examination of the case.

**Legal Issues:**

*   **Authority to Represent the People on Appeal:** Whether a private prosecutor, even with the conformity of an Assistant City Prosecutor, can represent the People of the Philippines in an appeal before the CA in a criminal case.
*   **Exceptions to the OSG's Sole Authority:** Whether the instant case falls under the exception to the OSG's exclusive authority, citing *Perez v. Hagonoy*, *Mobilia Products, Inc. v. Umezawa*, *People v. Santiago*, and *Narciso v. Sta. Romana-Cruz*.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Whether petitioner was denied due process.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Rationale:**

*   The OSG has the sole authority to represent the People on appeal in criminal proceedings before the CA and the SC (Sec. 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III of Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code; PD 478).
*   Private prosecutor's participation is subordinate to the People's interest and cannot contradict the OSG's position.
*   The *Perez* line of cases allowing private prosecutors to file appeals are limited to petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 involving grave error and lack of due process, which are not present here.
*   No grave abuse of discretion found on the part of lower courts in dismissing the complaints, because the MTC and RTC found that the petitioner was not duly authorized by the owner of the subject property to collect and receive rentals thereon. Thus, the checks were without valuable consideration and issued for a non-existing account. Moreover, Petitioner availed of every opportunity to present her case.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact on Private Complainants:** This case reinforces the limited role of private complainants in criminal appeals and highlights their dependence on the OSG to pursue the case.
*   **"Interest of Justice" Exception:** While the SC acknowledges the "interest of justice" exception in *Perez*, it narrowly confines it to Rule 65 petitions involving grave abuse and lack of due process. This might create difficulties in future cases where substantial injustice exists but doesn't neatly fit the certiorari framework.
*   **Valuable Consideration & Due Process:** The findings of the lower courts with respect to "valuable consideration" & "due process" were factors that influenced the Supreme Court's decision in this case. Future cases must be diligent in analyzing the basis for a determination of "valuable consideration."

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The OSG's authority in criminal appeals is paramount.
*   Private prosecutors must align their positions with the OSG's.
*   The "interest of justice" exception is narrowly construed and should be invoked carefully.
