**Case Summary: *Re: Disapproval of the Permanent Appointment of Mr. Godofredo C. De Leon***

**Citation:** A.M. No. 06-12-720-RTC, October 17, 2008 (590 Phil. 292)

**Facts:** Godofredo C. De Leon's promotional appointment as Clerk III was disapproved by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) due to falsification and misrepresentation. He submitted a Personal Data Sheet (PDS) and a Report of Rating indicating he passed the Career Service Sub-Professional exam. The CSC found that his name wasn't on the list of eligibles, and the submitted Report of Rating belonged to his brother, Reynaldo C. De Leon, with alterations.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Civil Service Rules:** Sections 7 and 9, Rule V of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, prohibit false statements and violations of Civil Service Law in appointments.
*   **Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (RA 6713):** Mandates high ethical standards and responsibility in public service.
*   **Respondent's Obligation:** To provide accurate information in his PDS and appointment documents.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dishonesty and Falsification of Official Document:** Defined as making a falsity in any material fact, fraud, or deception.  The Court has consistently held that dishonesty is a grave offense, especially within the judiciary. See *Re: Spurious Certificate of Eligibility of Tessie G. Quieres*; *Corpuz v. Ramiterre*; *Wooden v. Civil Service Commission*.
*   **Administrative Liability:** Subject to penalties under Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, including dismissal for grave offenses.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While De Leon pleaded for mercy, claiming family welfare as motivation, the Court, citing *Prieto v. Cariaga*, held that remorse does not excuse the transgression.
*   **Ambiguity (if any):**  The document suggests no inherent ambiguities. De Leon admitted to the falsification, negating arguments for unintentional error.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **EO 292, Book V, Rule V, Sections 7 and 9:** Grounds for disapproval of appointments based on false statements or violations of civil service rules.
*   **Republic Act No. 6713:** Code of Conduct for Public Officials, setting standards of ethics.
*   **Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations, Rule XIV, Section 23:**  Provides for penalties, including dismissal, for dishonesty and falsification.
*   **Civil Service Commission v. Sta. Ana, A.M. No. OCA-01-4:** Precedent for dismissal for submitting a spurious Certificate of Eligibility.
*   **Re: Spurious Certificate of Eligibility of Tessie G. Quieres, RTC, Office of the Clerk of Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 05-5-268-RTC:** Reinforces the high standards for integrity in the judiciary.
*   **Corpuz v. Ramiterre, 476 SCRA 108 (2005):** Defines dishonesty.
*   **Wooden v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 152884, September 30, 2005, 471 SCRA 512, 526 (2005); Alabastro v. Moncada, A.M. No. P-04-1887, December 16, 2004, 447 SCRA 42, 53:** Defines dishonesty.

**Conclusion:**

De Leon's actions constitute dishonesty and falsification of official documents, violating Civil Service rules and RA 6713. The Court affirmed the dismissal, emphasizing the high standards of integrity required in the judiciary, referencing established case law demonstrating a zero-tolerance policy for such offenses. No apparent ambiguities exist given De Leon's ultimate admission.
