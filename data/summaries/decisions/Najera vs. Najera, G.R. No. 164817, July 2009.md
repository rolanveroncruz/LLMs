Here's a concise legal summary of the case *Najera v. Najera*, G.R. No. 164817, July 3, 2009:

**Case:** *Digna A. Najera v. Eduardo J. Najera*

**Issue:** Whether the totality of evidence presented by the petitioner (wife) was sufficient to prove that the respondent (husband) was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential obligations of marriage under Article 36 of the Family Code, warranting annulment.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling granting legal separation but denying the petition for annulment.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:**  Requires proof of psychological incapacity existing *at the time of marriage celebration* and grave enough to disable a party from assuming marital obligations.  See *Republic v. Court of Appeals* (268 SCRA 198) for guidelines on its interpretation.

*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner bears the burden of proving the nullity of the marriage.  Doubts are resolved in favor of marriage validity.

*   **Psychological Incapacity Requirements (per *Republic v. CA* and *Santos v. CA*):**
    *   **(a) Medically or Clinically Identified, Alleged, Proven, and Explained:** The root cause must be medically or clinically identified, alleged in the complaint, sufficiently proven by experts (psychiatrists/clinical psychologists), and clearly explained in the decision.  The incapacity must be psychological, not merely physical.
    *   **(b) Juridical Antecedence:** Existing at the time of marriage celebration ("I do's").
    *   **(c) Incurability:** Medically or clinically permanent or incurable (absolute or relative to the other spouse).
    *   **(d) Gravity:** Grave enough to bring about the disability to assume essential marital obligations.  "Mild characteriological peculiarities, mood changes, occasional emotional outbursts" are insufficient.

*   **Expert Testimony (Gates Report):** The Court found the psychologist's (Cristina Gates) conclusions unscientific and unreliable because her assessment was primarily based on the petitioner's information, not a personal evaluation of the respondent. Also it lacked sufficient evidence that respondent was indeed incurable.

*   **Canon Law:** While interpretations of the National Appellate Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church should be given great respect, they are not controlling.  Here, the Matrimonial Tribunal's decision was based on a "grave lack of due discretion of judgment" (Canon 1095, 2), *not* on psychological incapacity (Canon 1095, 3).  Furthermore, the evidence before the Matrimonial Tribunal (sister-in-law testimony) differed from the evidence presented to the RTC.

*   **Legal Separation Grounds (Article 55, Family Code):** Respondent's physical violence, abusive conduct, and abandonment, while justifying legal separation, do not automatically equate to psychological incapacity for annulment under Article 36.

**Liabilities/Obligations:** The parties are legally separated. The court also decreed that conjugal property be divided equally between the parties.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Hearsay:** The psychologist's heavy reliance on the petitioner's statements weakens the probative value of her expert opinion.
*   **Conflict of Laws:**  The case highlights the potential conflict between civil annulment based on psychological incapacity and religious annulment under Canon Law, especially when the factual basis and legal standards differ.
*   **Article 36 Ambiguity:**  The application of Article 36 remains complex and highly fact-specific, making predictions about future cases challenging.
