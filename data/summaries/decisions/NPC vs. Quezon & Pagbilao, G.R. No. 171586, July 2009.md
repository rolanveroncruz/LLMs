**Case:** *National Power Corporation vs. Province of Quezon and Municipality of Pagbilao*, G.R. No. 171586, July 15, 2009 (610 Phil. 456)

**Issue:** Whether NPC, a GOCC, can claim tax exemption under Section 234 of the LGC for real property taxes assessed against Mirant Pagbilao Corporation (Mirant), whose tax liabilities NPC contractually assumed under an Energy Conversion Agreement (ECA).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Energy Conversion Agreement (ECA):** BOT agreement between NPC and Mirant, where Mirant builds and operates a power plant for 25 years before transferring it to NPC.
*   **Article 11.1 of ECA:** NPC assumed responsibility for Mirant's taxes, including real estate taxes, excluding taxes based on net income.
*   **Section 234(c) of LGC:** Exempts machineries/equipment used by local water districts and GOCCs engaged in water/electric power generation and transmission.
*   **Section 234(e) of LGC:** Exempts machinery/equipment used for pollution control and environmental protection.
*   **Section 226 of the LGC:** States the parties vested with the personality to contest assessment.
*   **Section 218(d) of LGC:** Assessment level for GOCCs engaged in power generation is 10% for real property taxes.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **NPC's Contractual Obligation:** NPC contractually agreed to pay Mirant's taxes under the ECA.
*   **Mirant's Tax Liability:** Under the LGC, the tax liability rests on the owner of the real property.
*   **NPC's Claim of Tax Exemption:** NPC claimed tax exemptions under Section 234(c) and (e) of the LGC.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **NPC's Standing to Protest:** The Court held NPC lacked the "legal interest" under Section 226 of LGC to protest the assessment because it was neither the owner nor the possessor/user of the subject machineries. Mirant held ownership of the power plant. *Cari√±o v. Ofilado*, G.R. No. 102836, January 18, 1993, 217 SCRA 206
*   **Application of LGC Section 234(c):** The court found the exemption under LGC Section 234(c) does not apply because Mirant, a private corporation, is the one actually using the machineries not NPC. The test of exemption is the nature of the use, not ownership, of the subject machineries.
*   **Sin Perjuicio LBAA Order:** The lower LBAA ruling was *sin perjuicio* (without prejudice), however, NPC was estopped from questioning the CBAA's appellate jurisdiction, because it appealed to the CBAA, thus submitting itself to the board's jurisdiction. *De Leon v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 96107, June 19, 1995, 245 SCRA 106

*   Civil Code Article 1311: Principle of relativity of contracts.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **NPC's Contractual Assumption of Liability:** The ECA's provision where NPC assumed Mirant's tax liability only creates a contractual obligation between NPC and Mirant, not directly enforceable by the local government. NPC does not have the legal interest required to protest the tax imposed by law on Mirant.
*   **Anti-Pollution Devices Exemption:** While NPC asserted that the assessed machineries included anti-pollution devices exempt under Sec. 234(e) of the LGC, this argument was rendered moot because NPC lacked standing to contest the assessment.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court denied NPC's petition, affirming the CTA en banc's decision. The NPC cannot claim tax exemptions under Section 234 of the LGC for Mirant's real property taxes despite assuming the tax liability contractually. The test of exemption is the use, not the ownership of the subject machineries.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**
The government unit may only collect the unpaid taxes from Mirant since Mirant held the ownership and use of the properties when the tax was levied. NPC's recourse is to bring the matter up as a breach of contract against Mirant.
