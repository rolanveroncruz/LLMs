**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Nueva***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 173248, November 03, 2008 (591 Phil. 431)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Dante Nueva for Murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The information alleged conspiracy, treachery, evident premeditation, and abuse of superior strength.
*   **RTC Finding:** Guilty of Murder qualified by treachery; sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **CA Affirmance:** Affirmed RTC decision, added moral and exemplary damages.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed conviction for Murder, but modified the qualifying circumstance of treachery to abuse of superior strength.

**Key Elements & Analysis:**

*   **Identification:** Positive identification by eyewitness Alfonso Bacar, Jr. of Nueva as one of the assailants who stabbed the victim. Witness knew the appellant for 4 years.
*   **Alibi/Denial (Defense):** The accused claimed to have been working as a bouncer at the Yellow Submarine at the time of the crime and failed to get a certification from Yellow Submarine because no one visited him. The court stated to be believed, denial must be supported by strong evidence of non-culpability; otherwise, it is purely self-serving.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:**
    *   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts in this conclusion as there was no sufficient showing that the mode or method of attack was deliberately adopted.
    *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Upheld, the victim was unarmed and outnumbered. The assailants took advantage of their superior number and combined strength as against the relatively defenseless victim.
    *   **Evident Premeditation:** Not proven; prosecution failed to establish the required elements, and no prior incident or motive were established.
*   **Conspiracy:** Inferred from coordinated actions of the accused and co-conspirators (holding, striking, stabbing). The joint actions sufficiently point to a common design to end the life of the victim.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua. The appellant claimed that he was wrongly convicted of murder, and that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Nueva found guilty of Murder and sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: Reduced to P55,438.00
    *   Moral Damages: the appellant is ordered to pay the heirs of the victim P1,010,552.40 as indemnity for loss of earning capacity.
    *   Exemplary Damages: Upheld.

*   **New Civil Code:** Art. 2230 (Exemplary Damages)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Strength of Identification:** While positive identification was made, defense counsel may argue the witness's distance from the incident could affect the accuracy of their perception.
*   **Conspiracy Inference:** The inference of conspiracy could be challenged by arguing lack of direct evidence of a prior agreement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for murder based on eyewitness testimony and the presence of abuse of superior strength. The civil liabilities were modified. The key risk lies in potential challenges to the reliability of the eyewitness identification and the inference of conspiracy.
