**Case Summary: Padilla-Rumbaua v. Rumbaua, G.R. No. 166738, August 14, 2009 (612 Phil. 1061)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) declaration of nullity of marriage based on the Respondent's psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code (Psychological Incapacity):**  Central issue is whether Respondent suffered from psychological incapacity at the time of marriage, rendering him unable to comply with essential marital obligations. The court applies the principles established in *Santos v. Court of Appeals* and *Republic v. Court of Appeals*, requiring gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.
*   **Republic v. Molina Guidelines:** The petition argued that the RTC decision was premature because it was rendered without the Solicitor General's (OSG) certification as required in *Republic v. Molina*. The Supreme Court ruled that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages) which relaxed the requirement of OSG certification, applies retroactively as it is a procedural rule.  The presence of a prosecuting attorney in the case to prevent collusion is sufficient. *Antonio v. Reyes* and *Navales v. Navales* support the ruling that the amendment dispensed with the *Molina* guideline on the matter of certification.
*   **Expert Witness Testimony:** The petitioner presented the testimony and psychological report of Dr. Nedy Lorenzo Tayag. The court found the expert testimony insufficient, criticizing it for being primarily based on the Petitioner's account without direct examination of the Respondent. The report and testimony lacked specifics, failing to establish the root cause, gravity, and incurability of Respondent's alleged narcissistic personality disorder at the time of the marriage. *So v. Valera* is cited.
*   **Remand for Further Proceedings:** Petitioner sought a remand for the reception of additional evidence, arguing inadequacy of evidence due to her previous counsel's errors. The court denied the request, deeming it an improper attempt to obtain a new trial without meeting the necessary grounds (Rule 37, Section 1). Cited *Uy v. First Metro Integrated Steel Corporation*, Counsel negligence must be excusable to justify a new trial, something the Petitioner didn't prove.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner bears the burden of proving the Respondent's psychological incapacity with clear and convincing evidence. (Art. 36, Family Code, *Republic v. Court of Appeals*)
*   The prosecution's role is to ensure no collusion exists and that the integrity of evidence is maintained.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Hearsay:** The court emphasized the risk of relying solely on the Petitioner's account in assessing the Respondent's psychological state.  Future cases must focus on gathering independent corroborating evidence.
*   **Definition of Psychological Incapacity:** Article 36 remains subject to case-by-case interpretation, creating uncertainty.  The Court reiterated its cautious approach in *Ting v. Velez-Ting*. This lack of a clear statutory definition leads to inconsistent application.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 36:** The core statutory basis for psychological incapacity.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112019, January 4, 1995:** Established the criteria for psychological incapacity (gravity, juridical antecedence, incurability).
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997:** Provided guidelines for interpreting and applying Article 36.
*   **Republic v. Molina, G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997:** Set forth the requirement for OSG certification, later relaxed by A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:** The Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages, dispensing with the mandatory nature of an OSG certification in annulment cases.
*   **Uy v. First Metro Integrated Steel Corporation, G.R. No. 167245, September 27, 2006:** Case discussing the guidelines for applying new trials based on Counsel's negligence.
*   **Ting v. Velez-Ting, G.R. No. 166562, March 31, 2009.** Discussed the need for a case-to-case interpretation of Article 36 of the Family Code.
*   **Rule 37, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Provided guidelines on applying for a new trial.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding that the Petitioner failed to sufficiently prove the Respondent's psychological incapacity as defined under Article 36 of the Family Code and clarified by relevant jurisprudence. The ruling emphasizes the importance of providing thorough expert testimony grounded in concrete evidence and a cautious approach to annulment petitions, highlighting the state's interest in preserving the sanctity of marriage.
