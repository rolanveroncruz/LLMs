## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. MTJ-16-1879 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 14-2719-MTJ)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Bill D. Buyucan, MCTC, Bagabag-Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya.

**Issue:** Whether Judge Buyucan is guilty of gross misconduct.

**Ruling:**  Supreme Court finds Judge Buyucan GUILTY of gross misconduct and orders his DISMISSAL from service with forfeiture of benefits, disqualification from public office, and immediate vacation of unlawfully occupied land. He is further directed to SHOW CAUSE why he should not be disbarred.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Occupation:** Judge Buyucan illegally occupied a portion of land within a Department of Agriculture (DA) Cagayan Valley Hillyland Research Outreach Station (DA-CVHILROS) reservation (Proclamation No. 573). This was supported by sworn statements, DENR verification, and other evidence (see *Velasco v. Angeles*, 557 Phil. 1 (2007) regarding substantial evidence). Even if not the DA land, his admission of occupying the DPWH road-right-of-way (RRW) violates P.D. No. 17.
*   **Conflict of Interest/Impartiality:** Judge Buyucan acquired land from Eling Valdez, a respondent in a prior case he dismissed, shortly after rendering a favorable decision. This violates Canon 3, Section 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct and created an appearance of impropriety as he acquired the land within months of dismissing *Civil Case No. 626* and deciding *Criminal Cases No. 4691 and 5094* and *People of the Philippines v. Amado Valdez alias Eling* (*Agpalasin v. Agcaoili*, 386 Phil. 452 (2000)).
*   **Violation of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Judge Buyucan's actions erode public confidence in the judiciary (Canon 2) and fail to maintain impartiality (Canon 3).
*   **Building Permit Violation:** Constructed building of strong materials without necessary building permits in violation of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1096.

**Obligations:**

*   Immediately vacate the land occupied.
*   Remove all structures on the property.
*   Submit a compliance report within 30 days.
*   Show cause why he should not be disbarred.

**Liabilities:**

*   Dismissal from service.
*   Forfeiture of benefits (except accrued leave credits).
*   Disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office.
*   Potential disbarment.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** Judge Buyucan repeatedly denied ownership, claiming to occupy only RRW. The SC relies heavily on the findings of the investigating judge (Judge Flor).
*   **Disbarment Proceedings:** The SC may initiate disbarment proceedings due to violations of the Lawyer's Oath, Code of Professional Responsibility, and Canons of Professional Ethics.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:**  Enforcement of the order to vacate and remove structures may face practical challenges, particularly concerning other informal settlers.
