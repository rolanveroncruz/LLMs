**Case Summary: *Quezon Development Bank v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 101240, December 16, 1998**

This case involves a loan dispute between Quezon Development Bank (QDB) and Construction Services of Australia-Philippines, Inc. (CONSAPHIL). QDB sought to recover the principal amount of two promissory notes, plus interest and penalties, from CONSAPHIL and its individual officers (Dominguez, Cariño, and Elegado).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** QDB granted loans to CONSAPHIL evidenced by two promissory notes.
*   **Promissory Notes:** The notes stipulated interest at 14% per annum. Standard form used.
*   **Penalty Charges:** The notes included a clause for penalty charges (24% or 36% per annum) on "loan amortization in arrears."
*   **Repayment Terms:** The loans were payable in lump sum, not in amortizations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original RTC Decision:** Ordered respondents (CONSAPHIL, et al.) to pay the principal, 48% interest, attorney's fees, and costs. This was inclusive of penalties and other charges.
*   **CA Decision (Initial):** Modified the RTC decision, reducing the interest rate to 14% and imposing a 7% service charge, plus a 36% penalty. Case remanded to determine loan amount and any excess payment.
*   **CA Decision (Modified):** The CA *eliminated* the 36% penalty charge, finding it inapplicable since the loan was not subject to amortization.
* **SC Decision:** Affirms the CA's modified decision, thus absolving the respondents from paying the 36% penalty.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Promissory Notes:** The penalty clause referring to "amortizations" created ambiguity, as the loans were payable in lump sums. *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Margarine-Verkaufs Union*, 93 SCRA 257.
*   **Contracts of Adhesion:** The Supreme Court recognized that promissory notes were prepared by the bank (contracts of adhesion, *Sucat Lines, Inc. vs. Teves, 83 SCRA 261; Angeles vs. Calasang, 135 SCRA 323, 334*), construing any ambiguity against the bank.
*   **Waiver Argument:** QDB argued that CONSAPHIL's request for a waiver of penalty charges implied acknowledgement of liability, but this argument failed since it was considered an error of legal interpretation by CONSAPHIL.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Lumibao v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 189 SCRA 469 (1990):** Addresses the issue of an appellee's right to seek affirmative relief on appeal.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Margarine-Verkaufs Union, 93 SCRA 257:** Deals with construction against author in contracts of adhesion.
*   **Sucat Lines, Inc. vs. Teves, 83 SCRA 261; Angeles vs. Calasang, 135 SCRA 323, 334:** Relates to contracts of adhesion and the parties' participation in the contract.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *penalty charge clause* itself, as its applicability to a lump sum loan was the core issue. The clause explicitly referred to “loan amortization in arrears,” which was factually impossible in this case.

**Legal Precision and Interpretation:** The Supreme Court focused on the precise wording of the penalty clause and the nature of the loan agreement (lump sum vs. amortized) to conclude that the penalty was not applicable.
