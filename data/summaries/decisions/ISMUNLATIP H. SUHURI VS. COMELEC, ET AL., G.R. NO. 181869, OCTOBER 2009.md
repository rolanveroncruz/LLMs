**Case Summary: Suhuri v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 181869, October 3, 2009**

**Nature:** Certiorari questioning COMELEC *en banc* resolution reversing the Second Division and upholding the proclamation of Hayudini as Mayor. The core issue is whether the exclusion of certain election returns from the canvass due to alleged irregularities and statistical improbability were proper grounds for a pre-proclamation controversy.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 1, Article XX, Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Defines pre-proclamation controversy as pertaining to proceedings of the board of canvassers.
*   **Section 243, OEC:** Enumerates exclusive issues raisable in pre-proclamation controversies (illegal composition of board, incomplete/defective returns, returns tampered/falsified/prepared under duress, fraudulent returns).
*   **COMELEC's Role:** Restricted to examining election returns in pre-proclamation controversies; lacks jurisdiction to investigate election irregularities beyond the face of the returns.

**Allegations:**

Suhuri alleged the exclusion of 25 election returns based on the returns being manufactured, tampered, falsified, prepared under duress, and displaying statistical improbability. Specific allegations included:

*   Missing signatures/thumbprints of poll watchers and poll clerks.
*   Statistically improbable zero votes for Suhuri in some precincts and near perfect result in favor of opponent.
*   Alleged incidents of violence, duress, and voter intimidation based on affidavits.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Suhuri's Failure of Proof:** The Supreme Court (SC) found Suhuri failed to demonstrate that the alleged irregularities constituted valid grounds for a pre-proclamation controversy. Formal defects were deemed insufficient to warrant exclusion.
*   **Statistical Improbability Doctrine:** The SC emphasized that statistical improbability, as defined in *Lagumbay v. COMELEC*, requires uniformity of tallies and systematic blanking of candidates of one party which was not shown in this case.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Affidavits regarding voter intimidation and irregularities were deemed insufficient as they did not directly relate to the preparation of the election returns and were based on hearsay. The COMELEC rightly determined they did not relate to the fact of the election returns being manufactured or prepared under duress.
*   **Risk of Disenfranchisement:** SC warned against overly broad application of statistical improbability to avoid disenfranchising innocent voters.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Sections 1, Article XX, 243, 233, 234, 235, and 236 are central to defining pre-proclamation controversies and permissible grounds.
*   **Lagumbay v. COMELEC, G.R. No. L-25444, January 31, 1966:** Established the doctrine of statistical improbability, but SC deemed the doctrine inapplicable here due to lack of uniform tally or systematic blanking of votes.
*   **Baterina v. COMELEC, G.R. Nos. 95347-49, January 6, 1992:** Upheld that formal defects in the returns do not necessarily affect authenticity or genuineness of the subject election returns as to warrant their exclusion from the canvassing, being but defects in form insufficient to support the conclusion that these had been tampered with or spurious.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Statistical Improbability Threshold:** The application of the statistical improbability doctrine is highly fact-specific, leaving room for disagreement on whether a specific set of results crosses the threshold.  The SC has made clear the scrutiny of the board should be restricted and it should be viewed with utmost care.
*   **Burden of Proof in Certiorari:**  Suhuri failed to meet the burden of demonstrating grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC, a high bar.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the COMELEC *en banc*'s decision, confirming Hayudini's proclamation. The ruling reinforces the limited scope of pre-proclamation controversies and emphasizes that challenges based on alleged irregularities during voting are best addressed through election protests, not pre-proclamation controversies. The court emphasized that statistical improbability is not a standalone basis for exclusion but must be restrictively viewed.
