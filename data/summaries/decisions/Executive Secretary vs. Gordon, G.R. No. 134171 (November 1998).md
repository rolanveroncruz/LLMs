## Legal Document Summary: *Executive Secretary v. Gordon* (G.R. No. 134171)

**Nature:** Petition for Contempt of Court. The petitioners (Executive Secretary and Arturo C. Lomibao) allege that respondents (Richard J. Gordon, Anacleto M. Diaz, and Orlando E. Mendiola) engaged in forum-shopping by filing two petitions involving the same issues before the Supreme Court (SC) and the Regional Trial Court (RTC) at Olongapo City.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Respondents violated Rule 7, Section 5 of the Rules of Civil Procedure regarding certification against forum-shopping. Specifically, petitioners point to the filing of two actions based on the same issue.

*   **Respondents' Defense:** Respondents argue that they complied with Rule 7, Section 5 by disclosing the existence and subsequent withdrawal of their petition before the SC in the certification of non-forum shopping attached to their petition before the RTC. They withdrew the SC petition to adhere to the hierarchy of courts.

*   **Court's Ruling:** The SC dismissed the petition for contempt, finding *no* forum-shopping.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Outlines the requirements for certification against forum shopping.
*   ***PCGG v. Sandiganbayan*** **(G.R. Nos. 105808, 105809, & 109592):** Cited by respondents to support the argument that withdrawing a case from a higher court to seek recourse in a lower court is not forum-shopping. The Supreme Court did not fault TMEE's lawyers who withdrew their motion before the Supreme Court and filed a petition with the SEC to stop the PCIB stockholders' meeting, finding that there was no willful disregard or defiance of its orders, or forum-shopping, by the TMEE lawyers
*   ***First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals, et al.*** **(Various citations):** Defines forum-shopping and its prohibited nature.
*   ***Chemphil Export & Import Corp. v. Court of Appeals*** **(251 SCRA 257):** Summarizes rulings on what constitutes forum-shopping.
*   ***E. Razon, Inc. v. The Philippine Port Authority*** **(151 SCRA 233):** Distinguished. In *E. Razon*, the party filed a petition in the RTC after filing a similar one in the Supreme Court, *and* after being assured of favorable action in the lower court before seeking to withdraw the Supreme Court petition. This was held to be forum shopping. This is in contrast to *Gordon* where withdrawal was sought (and effectively granted) from the Supreme Court.
* Administrative Order No. 1, issued by President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, "recalling, withdrawing, and canceling the appointment of Richard J. Gordon as Chairman of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority for a term of six (6) years, dated February 10, 1998, by former President Fidel V. Ramos.
* Gordon vs. Payumo G.R. No. 134071.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The timing of the Notice of Withdrawal and the filing in the RTC. While the notice was filed *before* the RTC case, the SC had not yet formally granted the withdrawal. The SC, however, understood the time-sensitive nature of the TRO sought by Gordon, and granted a level of latitude.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   While the respondents ultimately prevailed, the initial allegation of forum-shopping posed a risk of contempt charges, administrative sanctions, and even criminal liability.
*   *E. Razon* shows the importance of properly withdrawing a case before initiating a similar one in a lower court, and waiting for that motion to be granted, to avoid a finding of forum shopping.

**Key Takeaway:** Filing of multiple suits is not forum-shopping if (1) a party first withdraws a case from a higher court to seek recourse in a lower court (hierarchy of courts is to be followed) and (2) no unfavorable decision has been made in any court against that party. Furthermore, the SC is willing to take a party's time sensitive circumstances into consideration when reviewing the matter.
