## Legal Document Summary: *Delos Santos v. Papa and Mateo*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA decision affirming the RTCâ€™s award of damages and attorney's fees to Respondents based on a counterclaim in a case for Annulment of Deed of Sale and Cancellation of Title.

**Facts:** Petitioner (Delos Santos) was leasing property from Respondent (Papa), who later sold it to Respondent (Mateo). Petitioner filed suit to annul the sale, claiming right of first refusal under PD 1517. The RTC dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence and granted Respondents' counterclaim for damages. The CA affirmed with modification.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Petitioner alleged a right of first refusal under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1517 and P.D. No. 2016, arguing that a sale to Mateo without a written offer to him was void.
*   **Right of First Refusal (P.D. No. 1517):** The Court examined whether Petitioner qualified as a beneficiary under Sec. 6 of the Act, requiring legitimate tenancy for 10+ years, a home built on the land, continuous residence for 10+ years, and the property being within a declared APD and ULRZ. The Court questioned whether the failure to pay rent necessarily negates "legitimate tenant" status.
*   **Rule 34 Implementing P.D. No. 1517:** The Court held that Petitioner's argument for absence of a written offer to sell to the tenant had a legal basis.
*   **Respondents' Counterclaim:** Respondents were awarded moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees for alleged bad faith in filing the annulment suit.
*   **Main Issue:** Whether the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees to Respondents was proper given the circumstances of the case.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **P.D. No. 1517:** Places obligations on landowners in designated Urban Land Reform Areas to offer the right of first refusal to qualified tenants.
*   **Article 19 of the Civil Code:** Concerns acting with justice, giving everyone their due, and observing honesty and good faith.

**Liabilities:**

*   The central question is whether the Petitioner can be held liable for damages for filing a suit to protect his right of first refusal. The Court held, even if the claim lacks merit, damages and attorney's fees were an automatic penalty on the right to litigate, and the dismissal of the initial case does not by default entail a malicious prosecution
**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misinterpretation of "Legitimate Tenant":** Lower courts potentially misconstrued the meaning of "legitimate tenant" under P.D. 1517, focusing solely on the failure to pay rent without considering the factual context of the possession of the subject property.
*   **Automatic Award of Damages:** The lower courts' decisions risked establishing a precedent where unsuccessful litigation automatically triggers damage awards, chilling access to courts.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1517 (Urban Land Reform Act) and P.D. No. 2016:** Statutory basis for the right of first refusal.
*   **Civil Code Art. 2219:** enumerates instances for recovery of moral damages, including malicious prosecution.
*   **Civil Code Art. 2008:** enumerates instances for recovery of attorney's fees.
*   **Crystal v. Bank of the Philippine Islands:** Law is not intended to be a penalty for filing an unfounded suit
*   **Mahinay v. Velasquez, Jr.:** No Exemplary damages are to be awarded where moral damages cannot be supported

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "legitimate tenant"** under P.D. 1517 and 2016. Whether mere failure to pay rent automatically disqualifies a tenant from invoking rights under the law.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *REVERSED* the CA decision, *SETTING ASIDE* the award of damages and attorney's fees, holding that the filing of the annulment suit was not entirely without basis and did not constitute malicious prosecution or an abuse of rights.
