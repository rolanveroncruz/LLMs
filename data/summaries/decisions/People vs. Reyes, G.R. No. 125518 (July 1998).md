## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 125518 (1998)

**Type:** Criminal Case - Parricide Appeal

**Facts:** Accused-appellant, Benjamin Reyes, was convicted of parricide for stabbing his 13-year-old daughter, Cherry Reyes. The prosecution's case relied primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Reyes's 9-year-old son, Donnie, and initially, the sworn statement of Reyes's wife, Julieta. Julieta later recanted her statement implicating Reyes. The RTC sentenced Reyes to death.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Parricide (Article 246, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659).
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The central issue is the reliability of Donnie's eyewitness account identifying Reyes as the perpetrator. The defense challenged Donnie's credibility due to his age, initial reluctance to speak, alleged pressure from Julieta's relatives, and claimed inconsistencies.
*   **Retracted Testimony:** Julieta's recantation of her initial statement weakened the prosecution's case, but the court found Donnie's testimony sufficient to establish guilt. The Court notes Julieta's suspicious behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the crime as reason to distrust her claim that she did not witness the crime.
*   **Aggravating/Mitigating Circumstances:** The Information did not allege any aggravating circumstances, and the Court found none present during the trial. This is crucial for determining the appropriate penalty.
*   **Penalty:** The RTC imposed the death penalty. The Supreme Court, however, found this improper because there were no proven aggravating circumstances.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Benjamin Reyes):** Found guilty of parricide and initially sentenced to death.
*   **State:** Burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Damages:** The RTC ordered Reyes to pay civil indemnity (₱50,000) and moral damages (₱50,000) to the heirs of the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Age and Credibility of Witness:** The primary risk lies in Donnie's age at the time of the incident and his potential vulnerability to external influences. The court acknowledges this, but found his testimony consistent and credible under cross-examination.
*   **Absence of Aggravating Circumstances:** The prosecution's failure to allege and prove any aggravating circumstances precluded the imposition of the death penalty.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 246, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes parricide.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 7659:** Amended Article 246 and other provisions of the Revised Penal Code, affecting the penalty for parricide.
*   **Article 63, Revised Penal Code:** Rules for the application of indivisible penalties based on the presence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances.
*   **People vs. Bolado, G.R. No. 105375, September 28, 1993:** This case is cited as a precedent for giving full faith and credit to the witness's identification of the accused in the absence of any evidence showing an improper motive.
*   **People vs. Echegaray, G.R. No. 117472, February 7, 1997:** This case is cited to support the statement that parricide is not a capital crime per se, but is punishable by the flexible penalty of reclusion perpetua to death.
*   **People vs. Camahalan, G.R. No. 114032, February 22, 1995:** This case is cited as a precedent for the need to find mitigating or aggravating circumstances in order to determine the lesser or greater penalty between reclusion perpetua and death.
*   **Republic Act No. 8177, approved on March 20, 1996:** This case is cited to show that the execution of the death penalty would have to be done by lethal injection instead of electrocution.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for parricide but modified the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* due to the absence of proven aggravating circumstances. The court relied heavily on the eyewitness testimony of the victim's younger brother.
