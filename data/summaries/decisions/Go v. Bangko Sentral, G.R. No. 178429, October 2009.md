## Legal Document Summary: *Jose C. Go v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas* (G.R. No. 178429)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision reinstating criminal charges against petitioner for violation of Section 83 of Republic Act No. 337 (General Banking Act).

**Key Issue:** Sufficiency of the Information charging Go with violating Section 83 of RA 337. Specifically, whether the Information adequately alleges the elements of the offense and whether it is fatally defective for using "and/or" and failing to state that the loans exceeded permissible credit limits.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Section 83 of RA 337:** Prohibits directors/officers of banking institutions from (1) borrowing bank deposits/funds, (2) guaranteeing loans from the bank to others, or (3) becoming an obligor for money borrowed from the bank, without written approval of the majority of the directors.
*   **Rule 110, Section 9 of the Rules of Court:** Requirements for an Information to include the nature and cause of the accusation, acts and omissions complained of.
*   **Rule 117, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for Motion to Quash Information, including insufficiency of facts alleged.
*   **Rule 117, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Amendment of Complaint or Information.

**Obligations:**
*   Bank directors/officers must obtain written approval from the majority of the board (excluding themselves) before borrowing or guaranteeing loans from the bank.
*   The bank itself has a reportorial requirement to record the approval and transmit it to the supervising department.

**Liabilities:**
*   Violation of Section 83 of RA 337 subjects the director/officer to imprisonment and a fine.
*   Failure of the bank to comply with the reportorial requirement subjects it to *quo warranto* proceedings under Section 87 of RA 337.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Use of "and/or" in the Information:** Go argued this made the Information vague and uncertain, as it suggested he acted both as a borrower *and* guarantor for the same loan. The Court held this merely described different modes of committing the offense and was not inherently problematic.
*   **Failure to Allege Exceeding Credit Limit:** Go argued the Information was defective for failing to allege that the borrowed funds/guaranteed loans exceeded the permissible credit limits outlined in the second paragraph of Section 83. The Court held that the credit limit is NOT an element of the offense of violating the approval requirement in the *first* paragraph of Section 83. Compliance with the ceiling does not negate the approval requirement.
*   **Premature Quashing by RTC:** The Court also noted that the RTC erred by failing to allow the prosecution to amend the Information before quashing it, per Rule 117 Section 4.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **RA 337 (General Banking Act), Section 83:** Central provision defining the offense.
*   **People v. Romualdez (G.R. No. 166510):** Establishes the determinative test for appreciating a Motion to Quash i.e the sufficiency of the averments in the Information
*   **Lazarte v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 180122):** Reinforces the idea that elements of the crime charged must be alleged clearly and accurately.
*   **Ramos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 117416):** Discusses the legislative intent behind banking laws, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding the public interest and depositors.
*   **Section 5 of RA 7353** An Act Providing For The Creation, Organization And Operation Of Rural Banks, And For Other Purposes) and **Presidential Decree No. 264**, as amended by RA 6848 (An Act Creating the Philippine Amanah Bank); See also **Section 18 of RA 1300** (Revised Charter of the Philippine National Bank) and **Section 16 of RA 3518** (An Act Creating The Philippine Veterans' Bank, And For Other Purposes).

**Ambiguities:** None apparent. The Court's interpretation of Section 83 is clear and straightforward.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court denied Go's petition, affirming the CA's reinstatement of the criminal charges. The Court found the Information sufficient and clarified that the credit accommodation limit is not an element of the offense of violating the approval requirement of Section 83 of RA 337. The case will proceed to trial.
