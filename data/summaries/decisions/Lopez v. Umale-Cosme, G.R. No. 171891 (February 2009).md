**Legal Document Summary: *Lopez v. Umale-Cosme***

**Case:** *Hernania "Lani" Lopez v. Gloria Umale-Cosme*, G.R. No. 171891, February 24, 2009 (599 Phil. 347)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of CA decision reversing the RTC and reinstating the MeTC decision for unlawful detainer.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Parties:**
    *   Petitioner: Hernania "Lani" Lopez (Lessee)
    *   Respondent: Gloria Umale-Cosme (Lessor)
*   **Subject Matter:** Apartment unit at 15 Sibuyan Street, Sta. Mesa Heights, Quezon City.
*   **Lease Terms:**  Oral lease agreement, monthly rental of P1,340.00.
*   **Cause of Action:**  Unlawful detainer based on (1) expiration of the lease and (2) non-payment of rentals. Lopez claimed she deposited rentals in a bank in trust for Umale-Cosme because the lessor did not collect them.
*   **MeTC Decision:**  Favored Lessor, ordering Lessee to vacate, pay back rentals (from Dec 1998), attorney's fees (P20,000) and costs of suit.
*   **RTC Decision:** Reversed MeTC, finding the lease lacked a definite period and that expiration of the period was therefore not grounds for ejectment.
*   **CA Decision:**  Reversed RTC, reinstating the MeTC decision.  The CA held that a month-to-month lease is considered a lease with a definite period, expiring at the end of each month.  Notices to vacate were given.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Lessee (Lopez):** Obligation to pay monthly rent. Liability for back rentals, attorney's fees, and eviction.
*   **Lessor (Umale-Cosme):**  Obligation to provide peaceful possession.
*   **Overarching Principle:** Payment on a monthly basis (without any specific agreement to the contrary) establishes a fixed period of a month. This means that the lease expires at the end of each month.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1673(1) of the Civil Code:** Lessor may judicially eject lessee when period agreed upon has expired.  CA relied on this provision.
*   **Article 1687 of the Civil Code:** Defines the period of lease when not fixed by agreement: month-to-month if rent is paid monthly. CA relied on this provision.
*   **Section 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 877 (Rent Control Law):**  This provision, as extended by RA No. 6643, RA No. 6828, RA No. 7644, and RA No. 8437, suspends Article 1673(1) of the Civil Code *except* when the lease is for a definite period.  The RTC incorrectly interpreted this as preventing ejectment in leases without a written fixed period.
*   **Article 1659 of the Civil Code:** Right of rescission of the lease contract due to nonpayment of rent, under which the aggrieved party may ask for (1) the rescission of the contract; (2) rescission and indemnification for damages; or (3) only indemnification for damages, allowing the contract to remain in force.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Acab v. Court of Appeals***:  Reaffirmed that Section 6 of B.P. Blg. 877 *does not* suspend the effects of Article 1687 of the Civil Code. Month-to-month leases are considered definite and expire after each month.
*   ***Leo Wee v. De Castro***: Rent paid monthly, period of lease terminates at the end of each month.
*   ***Chua v. Victorio***: Lessor has the right to rescind the contract of lease for non-payment of the demanded increased rental.
* Numerous other cases cited support the view that month-to-month leases expire at the end of each month, thereby providing a basis for ejectment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **"Definite Period" Interpretation:**  The central issue is the definition of "definite period" under the Rent Control Law. The lessee argued that the absence of a written, fixed-term contract meant the lease lacked a definite period, shielding her from ejectment. The Court rejected this, holding that a month-to-month payment arrangement establishes a definite period.
*   **Non-Payment of Rentals:** The Court seemed to gloss over Lopez’s claim of consigning rental payments into a bank and the circumstances surrounding it. While the CA ruling focused on the expiration of the lease as the primary cause of action, the MeTC ruling considered the non-payment of rentals as well. This opens a potential collateral issue of whether the consignation was proper and legally sufficient.
*   **Notice to Vacate:** The validity and sufficiency of the notices to vacate were implicitly accepted by the CA. Proof of proper notice is crucial in unlawful detainer cases. Any defect in the form, content, or service of the notice could have undermined the Lessor's case.
*   **Rent Control Violations:** The facts suggest the property was previously subject to rent control. While the specific applicable period of rent control is not evident, the lessor's actions (or inactions) with respect to rent collection could potentially expose the lessor to rent control violations, even if they are not directly relevant to the ejectment suit.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. The key takeaway is that a month-to-month lease, even without a written contract specifying a fixed term, is considered to have a "definite period" for purposes of ejectment actions under Article 1673 of the Civil Code, and such monthly lease may be terminated at the end of each month. The court strongly relied on *Acab v. Court of Appeals* in establishing this legal point. A potential for future legal issues may arise based on the Lessee’s claim about proper consignment of rental payments.
