Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Rebecca J. Palm vs. Atty. Felipe Iledan, Jr.*, A.C. No. 8242 (October 2, 2009)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court dismissed a disbarment complaint filed by Rebecca J. Palm against Atty. Felipe Iledan, Jr. The complaint alleged that Atty. Iledan violated Canon 21 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (confidentiality) and Rule 15.03, Canon 15 (conflict of interest).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Confidentiality (Canon 21):** Palm alleged Iledan used confidential information gained while retained counsel for Comtech. Specifically, his knowledge of a planned by-law amendment to allow teleconferencing during board meetings to object to shareholder's (Palm's) participation via teleconference during a stockholders' meeting.
*   **Conflict of Interest (Rule 15.03):** Palm argued Iledan created a conflict of interest when he represented Elda Soledad (former Comtech officer) in an estafa case filed by Comtech, his former client.

**Court's Reasoning & Holding:**

*   **No Breach of Confidentiality:** The Court held that information regarding the planned by-law amendment was not confidential. The Court states the following reasons 1. Stockholders are aware of the proposed amendments to the by-laws. 2. The by-laws are filed with the SEC and are considered public records. The information acquired by Iledan wasn't confidential because any amendment requires stockholder approval and filing with the SEC, making it a public record and not meant to be confidential. Therefore, objecting to teleconferencing based on the existing bylaws was not a breach.
*   **No Conflict of Interest:** The Court applied the *Quiambao v. Bamba* test for conflict of interest, emphasizing whether the lawyer would be asked to use confidential information against the former client (*Quiambao v. Bamba*, A.C. No. 6708, 25 August 2005, 468 SCRA 1). The Court found no evidence Iledan used confidential information against Comtech in representing Soledad in the *estafa* case. It also noted that Iledan's representation of Soledad occurred *after* the termination of his retainer agreement with Comtech and the matters arose after the lawyer-client relationship terminated.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 21, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Duty to preserve client confidences even after termination of the attorney-client relationship.
*   **Rule 15.03, Canon 15, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Prohibition against representing conflicting interests without informed written consent.
*   **Section 89, Corporation Code:** Stockholder voting by proxy
*   **Section 48, Corporation Code:** Amendment to by-laws must be filed with the SEC
*   ***Quiambao v. Bamba*:**  Test for determining conflict of interest.
*   ***Mercado v. Atty. Vitriolo*:** Case regarding the mere relationship of attorney and client does not raise a presumption of confidentiality.
*   ***Pormento, Sr. v. Atty. Pontevedra*:** Case regarding the lawyer owes to maintain inviolate the client's confidence or to refrain from doing anything which will injuriously affect him in any matter in which he previously represented him.
*   ***Lim-Santiago v. Sagucio*:** Case regarding the A lawyer's immutable duty to a former client does not cover transactions that occurred beyond the lawyer's employment with the client.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities (if any):**

*   **Subjectivity of "Confidential Information":** The determination of what constitutes "confidential information" remains somewhat subjective and fact-dependent. The court emphasized the publicly accessible nature of the by-laws in this case, which is a key factor, but does not provide a clear definition of "confidential information".

**Conclusion:** The Court ruled in favor of Atty. Iledan, finding no violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The decision highlights the importance of proving the confidential nature of information allegedly disclosed and clarifies that the duty to a former client does not extend indefinitely to all matters.
