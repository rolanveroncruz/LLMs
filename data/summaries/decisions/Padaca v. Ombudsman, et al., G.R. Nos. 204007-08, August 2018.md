**Case Summary: *Governor Maria Gracia Cielo M. Padaca v. Honorable Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales and Santiago Respicio; Servando Soriano and Dionisio Pine v. Honorable Sandiganbayan, Office of the Ombudsman and Santiago Respicio* (G.R. Nos. 201800, 204007-08; August 8, 2018)**

**Overview:** These consolidated petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 challenge the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause and the Sandiganbayan's denial of the motion to recall the warrant of arrest and motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause against Governor Padaca, Soriano, and Pine for Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and Malversation of Public Funds.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Transaction:** The case stems from a P25 Million loan released by the Provincial Government of Isabela to Economic Development for Western Isabela and Northern Luzon Foundation, Inc. (EDWINLFI), a private foundation managed by Soriano and Pine, from a P35M loan obtained from DBP. The loan was intended for the Priority Agricultural Modernization Project.
*   **Charges:** Governor Padaca, Soriano, Pine, and Provincial Legal Officer Atty. Johnas Lamorena were charged with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 and Malversation of Public Funds. Flores and Nicolas charges were dismissed.
*   **Ombudsman's Finding:** The Ombudsman found probable cause due to: (1) engagement of EDWINLFI without proper bidding; (2) MOA executed with EDWINLFI without SP ratification and alleged irregularities; (3) Suspected conflict of interest due to Atty. Lamorena's simultaneous position in EDWINLFI and as a Provincial Legal Officer. Padaca was deemed accountable for allowing EDWINLFI to take the funds.
*   **Sandiganbayan's Action:** The Sandiganbayan denied Soriano and Pine's Omnibus Motion to recall warrant of arrest and motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause, stating their arguments are defenses best threshed out during trial.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Padaca:** Allegedly violated Section 3(e) of RA 3019 by giving unwarranted benefits to EDWINLFI through manifest partiality in her discharge of official functions as governor and for malversation through negligence in administering public funds.
*   **Soriano & Pine:** Allegedly collaborated with Padaca to obtain unwarranted benefits at the expense of the Provincial Government in violation of Sec. 3(e), RA 3019.
*   **General Obligation:** Public officials have a duty to adhere to procurement rules (RA 9184) and to protect public funds from being misappropriated, malversed, or abandoned.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Good Faith Defense:** Padaca argues she acted in good faith, relying on SP ratification, but the timing and circumstances of the ratification are contentious.
*   **"Undue Injury" to Government:** A key element of Section 3(e) is "undue injury." Proving quantifiable financial loss to the government might be challenging, especially if EDWINLFI provided some services.
*   **Public Bidding Requirement:** Padaca contests the applicability of public bidding requirements under the circumstances of the program, but RA 9184's application to "management or consulting services" needs careful examination.
*   **Defenses:** Padaca's defense that she had no custody of public funds and Soriano/Pine's denial of conspiracy are factual issues to be proven in trial.
*   **Causation:** It is necessary to demonstrate a direct causal link between the acts of the accused and the alleged "undue injury" to the government.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act provision regarding corrupt practices through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses**

*   The exact nature of the services provided by EDWINLFI needs clarification.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for certiorari, upholding the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause and the Sandiganbayan's determination to proceed with the trial. The core issue is whether Padaca exhibited manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in relation to the loan release. The Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's view that these issues, along with the defenses raised by the accused, are best resolved in a full trial on the merits. The Supreme Court held that it cannot intrude into the Ombudsmanâ€™s determination of probable cause.
