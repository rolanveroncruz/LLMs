## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dagangan, G.R. No. 117951 (1998)

**Type of Document:** Philippine Supreme Court Decision, appeal of a Rape conviction.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Edwin Dagangan for Rape, citing reasonable doubt. The RTC found Dagangan guilty with the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and damages (P40,000). The Supreme Court, however, found the prosecution's evidence weak, particularly regarding the complainant's behavior and the brother's reaction, which were inconsistent with a forcible rape scenario.

**Key Provisions and Observations:**

*   **Accusation:** Dagangan was charged with Rape under Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, aggravated by dwelling.
*   **Prosecution's Evidence:** Relied primarily on the complainant's testimony, medical evidence showing hymenal tear, and her brother's account of finding the accused in the house.
*   **Defense's Evidence:** Consisted of denial, alibi (disputed by the RTC based on proximity), and claim of prior consensual relationship with the complainant.
*   **Hymenal Tear:** Medical testimony indicated that a hymenal tear could be caused by a voluntary sexual intercourse experienced for the first time.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance of Dwelling:** Applied in RTC decision, but rendered moot by reversal of the conviction.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Initially, Dagangan was obligated to serve a sentence of reclusion perpetua and pay damages. With the Supreme Court's reversal, he is acquitted and relieved of all liabilities.

**Potential Risks and Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court highlighted inconsistencies and improbabilities in the testimonies of the complainant and her brother, raising doubts about their veracity. The inconsistencies in the testimony brought the charges to the realm of reasonable doubt.
*   **Lack of Resistance/Outcry:** The complainant's lack of resistance and failure to shout for help were deemed questionable, especially given the circumstances described.
*   **Complainant's Behavior Post-Alleged Incident:** Serving supper to the alleged assailant was seen as highly improbable conduct for a rape victim.
*   **Brother's Reaction:** The brother's calm demeanor, failure to immediately confront the accused, and subsequent actions were considered inconsistent with a typical reaction to such a crime.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Implicitly Art. 266-A (Rape)
*   **People vs. Mercado, 161 SCRA 601; People vs. Melebo, G.R. No. 97921, Sept. 8, 1993:** Cited by the trial court, indicating that a previous relationship is not a license for forcible sexual acts.
*   **People vs. Hortillano, G.R. 71116, Sept. 19, 1989:** Cited by the trial court regarding reactions of rape victims, but ultimately undermined by other evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The entire case hinged on the conflicting testimonies and interpretations of the events, highlighting the ambiguity of the situation and the difficulty in proving rape beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the Rape conviction due to inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence which led to the creation of reasonable doubt, primarily concerning the complainant's actions and the brother's reaction to the alleged crime. The Court emphasized the need for strong evidence in rape cases, given the difficulty in disproving such accusations and the potential for abuse.
