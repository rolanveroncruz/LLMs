## Legal Document Summary: Dadizon vs. Mocorro (G.R. No. 159116)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a land dispute.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Sps. Nestor and Felicidad Dadizon (Dadizons)
*   **Respondents:** Sps. Dominador and Elsa Mocorro (Mocorros)

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over a 78-square meter portion of unregistered land.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

1.  **Ownership:** The Court affirms the lower courts' decisions that the Mocorros have a better right to the disputed 78-square meter lot.
2.  **Chain of Title:** The Mocorros established a clear chain of title originating from Ignacia Bernal, supported by tax declarations and a prior mortgage on the larger parcel (224 sqm).
3.  **Dadizons' Claim:** The Dadizons' claim, based on an unnotarized and unregistered deed of sale from Felicidad Dadizon's mother, Eustaquia Bernadas, was deemed insufficient.
4.  **Registration Requirement:** The Court emphasized that under Section 113 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), for unregistered lands, a deed of sale is only valid between the parties unless it is registered. The Dadizons' failure to register the deed meant it could not bind third parties like the Mocorros. (*Valdevieso v. Damalerio* applied by analogy even though it was a registered property)
5.  **Factual Findings:**  The Court gave great weight to the factual findings of the MTC and RTC, particularly regarding the credibility of witnesses and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the Dadizons' acquisition, including the "unidentified" prior tax declaration.
6.  **Procedural Issue:** The Dadizons erroneously filed a notice of appeal instead of a petition for review with the CA, which was the proper mode of appeal since the RTC's decision was made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. This procedural error, violating Rule 41 and Rule 42, Rules of Court, warranted the dismissal of their appeal. (*Murillo v. Consul* cited). The Court emphasized that procedural rules are mandatory and jurisdictional.
7.  **Res Inter Alios Acta:** The deed of sale from Bernadas to the Dadizons was considered *res inter alios acta* as far as the Mocorros were concerned, as the Mocorros were not part of the Deed of Sale transaction.
8. *Gutierrez v. Court of Appeals* was cited to emphasize the mandatoriness of following the rules and period to appeal.
9. *Dee Hwa Liong Electronics Corporation v. Papiona* was cited to show when liberal construction of the rules is not applicable to the given case.
10. *Republic v. Hernandez* was cited for justice needing the observance of indispensable technicalities.

**Obligations:**

*   The Dadizons are obligated to:
    *   Deliver the 78-square meter portion to the Mocorros.
    *   Demolish any structures erected on the disputed portion.
    *   Pay the Mocorros P10,000 for attorney's fees and litigation expenses.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Dadizons are liable for the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Issues:** Potential difficulties in enforcing the judgment if the Dadizons resist relinquishing the property.
*   **Future Litigation:** Risk of further litigation if the Dadizons attempt to assert alternative claims to the property based on different grounds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the judgment appears definitive, the potential for future disputes arising from the Dadizons' persistent claim should be considered.
*   The Deed of Sale from 1976 was seen as doubtful because it was an unnotarized document; there could potentially be more to this given there was an inconsistency.
