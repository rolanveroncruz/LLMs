## Legal Document Summary: *Emcor Incorporated v. Ma. Lourdes D. Sienes* (G.R. No. 152101, September 8, 2009)

**Case Summary:** This is a labor dispute involving the illegal dismissal of Ma. Lourdes D. Sienes (Respondent) by Emcor Incorporated (Petitioner) due to a retrenchment program. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding the dismissal illegal and ordering reinstatement with backwages.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 283 of the Labor Code:** Governs permissible retrenchment. Requires employers to provide written notice to employees and the DOLE one month before retrenchment, and to pay separation pay.
*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:** Petitioner (Employer) has the burden to prove the validity of the retrenchment.  This includes proving actual and substantial losses, compliance with the notice requirement, payment of separation pay, good faith in implementation, and the use of fair and reasonable criteria for selecting employees to be retrenched. (FASA v. PAL case)
*   **Retrenchment Requirements:** Per *Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippines Airlines, Inc.* (FASA v. PAL), retrenchment must be a last resort; economic losses must be substantial and imminent; notice must be given; separation pay must be paid; employer must act in good faith; fair and reasonable criteria must be used in selecting employees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Finding of illegal dismissal triggers liability for reinstatement and full backwages.
*   **Damages:** Though respondent prayed for moral and exemplary damages, they were not granted due to lack of evidence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Insufficient Proof of Losses:** The Petitioner failed to adequately demonstrate significant financial losses justifying retrenchment, relying on a "Comparative Income Statement" that the CA considered insufficient.  The CA required a signed or audited Income Statement for the year 1996, and showing of losses preceding 1996.  Comparative Income Statement for only parts of 1997 was insufficient. The CA also found that Petitioner was hiring new employees, seemingly negating the argument of economic hardship.
*   **Lack of Fair and Reasonable Criteria for Selection:** The Petitioner failed to demonstrate the use of objective criteria (e.g., seniority, efficiency) in selecting the Respondent for retrenchment. Respondent was retrenched while junior employees were retained or transferred. This is a violation of substantive due process.
*   **Procedural Errors:**
    *   Although the one month notice requirement was met, there was a procedural infirmity in that Respondent was not allowed to work on August 2, 1997 despite the notice of termination being made only on August 1, 1997.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 283** (Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel)
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Petition for Certiorari
*   ***Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines v. Philippines Airlines, Inc.* (FASA v. PAL):** Defines requisites of valid retrenchment.
*   ***Narzoles v. NLRC:*** Retroactive application of A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timeliness of the original Petition for Certiorari before the CA:** The CA initially found the petition was filed out of time, although the SC determined it was timely filed under A.M. No. 00-2-03-SC.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Petitioner's retrenchment program was deemed illegal due to insufficient evidence of substantial losses and a lack of fair and reasonable criteria in selecting employees for retrenchment. The CA's decision, affirmed by the SC, highlights the importance of employers meticulously documenting financial losses and adhering to procedural and substantive requirements when implementing retrenchment programs.
