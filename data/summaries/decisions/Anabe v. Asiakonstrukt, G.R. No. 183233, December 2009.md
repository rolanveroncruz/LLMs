**Case Summary: _Virgilio G. Anabe v. Asian Construction (Asiakonstrukt) et al._ G.R. No. 183233, December 23, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision upholding the NLRC's partial grant of Asian Construction's appeal, modifying the Labor Arbiter's decision regarding illegal dismissal, retrenchment, and money claims.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Retrenchment (Art. 283 Labor Code):** The central issue is whether Asiakonstrukt validly retrenched Virgilio G. Anabe due to business losses. The Court held that the retrenchment was unjustified due to Asiakonstrukt's failure to adequately substantiate its financial losses.

*   **Belated Submission of Financial Statements:** The NLRC's consideration of Asiakonstrukt's audited financial statements, submitted only on appeal, was questioned. While the NLRC can receive evidence on appeal, the delay must be explained, and the evidence must prove the employer's allegations. The court highlighted the company's failure to explain the belated submission and questioned how the management knew about the losses to justify the retrenchment decision.

*   **Prescription of Money Claims (Art. 291 Labor Code, Art. 1150 Civil Code):** The NLRC and the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that only illegal deductions made within three years prior to the filing of the complaint are recoverable. Claims prior to that period are barred by prescription. The filing of the complaint occurred in February 2000, hence deductions occurring from 1997-1999 are compensable.

**Obligations:**

*   **Asiakonstrukt:** To reinstate Anabe to his former position with full backwages and benefits from the date of dismissal until finality, or to pay separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. To pay reimbursement for the illegal deductions for the amount of P88,000. To pay the already decided amount for 13th month pay, overtime pay, and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Asiakonstrukt:** Liable for illegal dismissal and must provide reinstatement or separation pay, backwages, and benefits. Liable for reimbursement of illegal deductions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Recomputation of Monetary Awards:** The case is remanded to the NLRC for a recomputation of monetary awards. There's a risk of further disputes regarding the calculation of backwages and benefits due to the reinstatement order.
*   **Proof of losses for future retrenchment:** This case sets a high bar for proving financial losses to justify retrenchment. Any future retrenchment attempts by Asiakonstrukt will be scrutinized closely, requiring timely and complete documentation.
*   **Non-compliance with SEC filing requirements:** The court noted that Asiakonstrukt failed to submit financial statements to the SEC which lent credibility to the theory that their financial statements submitted on appeal may have been fabricated.

*   **_AG & P United Rank & File Association v. NLRC,_ 332 Phil. 937 (1996).:**The delay in the submission of evidence should be clearly explained and should adequately prove the employer's allegation of the cause for termination.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The ruling regarding belated submissions can be contentious depending on the specific circumstances and justifications provided by the employer.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court sided with the employee, finding that the employer failed to prove that financial losses warranted the termination and that the belated submission of financial statements raises concerns about their credibility. The case underscores the importance of strict compliance with documentation requirements and timely submission of evidence in retrenchment cases.
