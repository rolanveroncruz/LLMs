**Legal Document Summary: *Antonio Lopez y dela Cruz v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 184037**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Illegal Possession of Drugs (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or "shabu").

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Arresting officer (PO2 Atienza) testified to observing the petitioner with a plastic sachet containing a crystalline substance. The substance tested positive for shabu. Back-up officer PO1 Bacero and SPO1 Jaime Masilang was not able to give testimony.
*   **Defense's Case:** Petitioner claimed he was framed and the shabu was taken from another location.
*   **RTC & CA Decisions:** Conviction affirmed, relying on the testimony of PO2 Atienza and presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the CA decision, acquitting the petitioner due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Issues Raised by Petitioner:**

1.  **Warrantless Arrest:** Alleged illegality of the warrantless arrest.
2.  **Admissibility of Evidence:** Violation of Section 21 of R.A. 9165, questioning the chain of custody and marking of the seized drug.
3.  **Credibility of Evidence:** Alleged lack of credibility of the prosecution's evidence.

**Reasoning for Acquittal:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The Supreme Court found the chain of custody to be broken. Critical flaws included: (1) Marking of the plastic sachet with the initials "APA" only at the police office. (2) Failure to establish petitioner's presence during the marking. The prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the drug presented in court was the same one seized from the petitioner. The Court relied on *Guido Catuiran y Necudemus v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 175647, May 8, 2009) to reiterate the importance of establishing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court found the presumption of regularity inapplicable due to the police officers' failure to comply with standard procedures under R.A. 9165. The Court relied on *People v. Garcia* (G.R. No. 173480, February 25, 2009).

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which includes establishing an unbroken chain of custody. The law requires that the prohibited drug seized be marked in the presence of the accused.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Failure to strictly adhere to Sec. 21, RA 9165:** The lack of meticulous compliance with Sec. 21 of RA 9165 and its implementing rules, particularly the marking of the evidence in the presence of the accused immediately after confiscation, proved fatal to the prosecution's case.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** Undue reliance on the presumption of regularity can be problematic when there are indications of procedural lapses, as demonstrated in this case.
*   **"Plain View" Doctrine:** The CA's application of the "plain view" doctrine was not directly addressed by the Supreme Court, but it's implicit that the Court found the initial observation and seizure questionable given the totality of the circumstances.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5 & Section 21:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. Section 21 dictates the procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 113, Section 5(a):** Rule on in flagrante delicto arrests.
*   **Guido Catuiran y Necudemus v. People of the Philippines** (G.R. No. 175647, May 8, 2009): Importance of establishing the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Garcia** (G.R. No. 173480, February 25, 2009): The presumption of regularity arises only in the absence of contradicting details.
*   **People v. Naquita** (G.R. No. 180511, July 28, 2008): Outlines the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Points:**

*   The seven-meter distance at which PO2 Atienza claimed to observe the shabu was questioned but not specifically ruled upon.
*   The applicability of the "plain view" doctrine was implicitly rejected due to the circumstances surrounding the initial observation and seizure.
