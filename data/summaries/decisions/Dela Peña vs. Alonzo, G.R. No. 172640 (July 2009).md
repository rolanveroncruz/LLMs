## Legal Document Summary: Dela Pe単a v. Alonzo (G.R. No. 172640, July 03, 2009)

This case concerns a dispute over land ownership following foreclosure and subsequent repurchase from a bank. Petitioners (Dela Pe単a siblings) claim co-ownership with Respondents (Alonzo spouses, *substituted by heirs*) based on inheritance and an alleged agreement for joint repurchase of foreclosed land. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision ruling *against* the petitioners.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Unregistered parcel of land in Candaba, Pampanga, previously owned by Spouses Ignacio and Engracia Dela Pe単a (parents of Petitioners and Respondent Ligaya).
*   **Foreclosure:** Land was foreclosed by San Fernando Rural Bank in two separate transactions (1964 & 1966 mortgage leading to 1968 foreclosure and 1972 Levy of Execution) due to the Spouses Dela Pe単a's debt. Certificates of Sale and Final Sale were issued to the Bank.
*   **Repurchase:** Years later (1992), Respondent Ligaya Alonzo purchased the majority of the land from the San Fernando Rural Bank; a smaller portion purchased by another heir.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners claim co-ownership arguing a) the repurchase was implicitly for the benefit of all heirs, and b) there was an oral agreement for joint contribution to the repurchase.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Respondents deny co-ownership, arguing the bank was the absolute owner at the time of purchase and the purchase was solely on their behalf.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Failed to redeem the property within the statutory redemption periods after foreclosure. No longer have a claim to the property.
*   **Respondents:** No obligation to partition the property since they acquired it as sole owners. No oral agreement was found.
*   **Bank:**  Had the legal right to sell the property as the absolute owner following unredeemed foreclosure and levy on execution.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Oral Agreement:** Petitioners' reliance on an alleged oral agreement is weak. The SC affirmed the CA's factual finding *against* the existence of such an agreement. Parol evidence rule could be a bar to adducing evidence to vary or contradict what is contained in the writing.
*   **Equity of Redemption vs. Right of Redemption:** Misapplication of the term "equity of redemption" by the RTC (which it used to incorrectly mean a preference for heirs). The correct legal concept is the *right of redemption* in extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Lack of Formal Documentation:** Absence of a written agreement regarding the repurchase is detrimental to Petitioners' claim.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act 3135, Section 6:** Governs the right of redemption in extrajudicial foreclosures. Defines one-year redemption period.
*   **Rule 39, Section 30 (now Section 28):** Rules of Civil Procedure governing redemption period after levy on execution.
*   **Top-Rate International Services, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court (142 SCRA 467, 473):** Defines the term equity of redemption as applying to Judicial Foreclosures.
*   **Gold Loop Properties v. Court of Appeals (350 SCRA 371, 379-380):** Affirms the principle that factual findings of the Court of Appeals are generally conclusive on the Supreme Court.
*   **Parol evidence rule**

**Conclusion:**

The SC correctly applied legal principles, ruling that the bank had become the absolute owner through foreclosure and execution, and the Respondents purchased the property from the bank without any legal obligation to the Petitioners.  Petitioners' claims of co-ownership and a prior oral agreement were unsupported by evidence. The Petitioners' argument failed because the redemption periods had lapsed before the parents died, and the bank was therefore the sole owner, free to sell to whomever they chose.
