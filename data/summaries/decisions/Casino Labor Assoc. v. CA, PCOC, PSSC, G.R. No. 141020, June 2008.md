**Summary for Legal Counsel: Casino Labor Association v. Court of Appeals, PCOC, and PSSC (G.R. No. 141020)**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing a petition for certiorari against the NLRC's denial of a motion to remand consolidated labor cases to the Arbitration Branch.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Supreme Court's Resolution in G.R. No. 85922 mandated the NLRC to assume jurisdiction over labor cases against private respondents PCOC and PSSC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the CA did not err in finding that the NLRC lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court firmly establishes that jurisdiction over employee-employer problems in PAGCOR, PCOC, and PSSC lies with the Civil Service Commission, *not* the NLRC/Department of Labor and Employment, because the companies were created by an original charter.
*   **Prior Ruling (G.R. No. 85922):** The Court clarifies that its prior statement in G.R. No. 85922 – "Any petitions brought against private companies will have to be brought before the appropriate agency or office of the Department of Labor and Employment" – was *obiter dictum* and did not apply to PCOC and PSSC in this case.
*   **Law of the Case:** The Court rejected the argument that G.R. No. 85922 established the law of the case requiring the NLRC to hear claims against PCOC and PSSC.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Petitioner (Casino Labor Association):** Risks dismissal of the underlying labor claims due to pursuing the case in the incorrect forum. The Court notes the petitioner's delay in pursuing the correct course of action (filing before the Civil Service Commission) after G.R. No. 85922 became final.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article IX-B, Section 2(1) of the Constitution:** Defines civil service coverage, encompassing government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.
*   **P.D. 1869, Section 18:** Initially prohibited union formation among casino employees (now modified by the Constitution, but subject to laws regulating unions in offices governed by Civil Service Law).
*   **Republic v. De Los Angeles (G.R. No. L-26112):** Rules on interpretation of judgments, emphasizing intent of the court.
*   **St. Martin Funeral Homes v. NLRC (G.R. No. 130866):** Established the hierarchy of courts, requiring appeals from NLRC to initially be filed in the CA.
*   **Santiago v. Vasquez (G.R. Nos. 99289-90):** Reiterated the importance of adhering to the hierarchy of courts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention is the interpretation of the Supreme Court's statement in G.R. No. 85922, which the Casino Labor Association argued mandated NLRC jurisdiction over claims against the private companies. The Supreme Court refuted that argument, stating that it was merely an obiter dictum to highlight when the the Department of Labor and Employment had jurisdiction.

**Potential Strategy:**

*   Advise the client that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction ruling against PCOC and PSSC is now final. The clients can file cases at the Civil Service Commission to pursue the case.
