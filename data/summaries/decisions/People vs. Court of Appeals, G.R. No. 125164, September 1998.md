## Legal Document Summary: People v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125164

**Nature of Document:** Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Supreme Court reviews the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the RTC's order granting a motion to quash an information for violation of Section 3602 in relation to Section 3601 of the Tariff and Customs Code.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Private respondents were charged with violating the Tariff and Customs Code by allegedly conspiring to fraudulently secure the release of imported PVC resins without remitting payment to the National Treasury. The information also alleged illegal withdrawal of the goods from a Customs-sealed warehouse.
*   **Motion to Quash:** Private respondents moved to quash the information, claiming that (1) the facts charged did not constitute an offense, (2) the criminal liability was extinguished, and (3) the information contained averments constituting a legal excuse or justification. Specifically, they argued that the customs duties and penalties were fully paid *before* the information was filed.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC granted the motion to quash, finding that the taxes and duties were paid, negating the allegation of non-remittance. The RTC also considered the companies involved as duly accredited and the withdrawal as covered by a valid Restraining Order.
*   **CA Ruling:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision on three main grounds: 1. Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration lacked proper notice of hearing, making the decision final, 2. Certiorari cannot substitute for a lost appeal, and 3. Trial court did not err since there was payment of taxes.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The information alleges a violation of Section 3602 (various fraudulent practices against customs revenue) in relation to Section 3601 (unlawful importation) of the Tariff and Customs Code.
*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the offense was committed before the alleged payment.
*   The movant (Petitioner) bears the obligation to properly set a motion for hearing with notice to the adverse party as per Rule 15, Sec. 4 of the Rules of Court (previously applicable).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Apprehension" Definition:** The last paragraph of Section 3602 of the TCCP states that payment of tax due *after apprehension* does not constitute a valid defense. The Court of Appeals found no sufficient evidence of "apprehension" prior to payment. The precise definition of "apprehension" in this context is crucial.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration Defect:** The core issue revolves around the lack of proper notice of hearing on the motion for reconsideration. This is based on Rule 15, Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Rules of Court (applicable then), as interpreted by cases such as *Manakil v. Revilla*, *Manila Surety Co. v. MRR*, *Del Castillo v. Aguinaldo*, and *Goldloop Properties Inc. v. Court of Appeals*. The absence of a notice of hearing renders the motion *pro forma* and does not toll the period to appeal.
*   **Finality of Judgement:** The Supreme Court's decision hinges on the procedural defect of the pro forma Motion of Reconsideration of the Prosecution, which had no notice of hearing. This means the finality of the order from the trial court and the resulting lack of jurisdiction from the Appellate Courts is the primary basis for the decision.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Tariff and Customs Code:** Sections 3601 and 3602 (Violation of Customs Laws)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 15, Sections 4, 5, and 6 (Motions) (applicable at the time)
*   **Case Law:** *Manakil v. Revilla* (42 Phil. 81), *Manila Surety Co. v. MRR* (21 SCRA 974), *Del Castillo v. Aguinaldo* (212 SCRA 169), *Goldloop Properties Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (212 SCRA 498), *Fulton Insurance Co. v. Manila Railroad Corporation*, *Sembrano v. Ramirez*, *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Far East Molasses*, *Cui v. Madayag*, *Marikina Valley v. Flojo*, *Manila Surety and Fidelity Co. v. Bath*, *In re Almacen*, *Cledera et. al. v. Sarmiento*, *Dela Peña v. Dela Peña*.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, effectively dismissing the criminal charges against the private respondents. This decision is primarily based on procedural grounds – the prosecution's failure to properly file its motion for reconsideration by neglecting to include the proper Notice of Hearing, rendering the original RTC order final and unappealable. The Supreme Court did not delve deeply into the merits of the case, specifically the issue of whether the "apprehension" of the goods occurred *before* the payment of customs duties and taxes.
