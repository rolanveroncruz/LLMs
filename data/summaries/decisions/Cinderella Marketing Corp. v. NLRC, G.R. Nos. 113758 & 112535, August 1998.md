**Legal Document Summary: *Cinderella Marketing Corporation vs. NLRC, et al. (G.R. No. 112535 & G.R. No. 113758)*, August 20, 1998**

**Nature:** Resolution modifying a prior decision affirming an award of money claims to employees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Affirmation of Money Claims:** The Court affirmed the NLRC's award of money claims to specific employees (listed in the document) in both G.R. No. 112535 and G.R. No. 113758.
*   **Modification:** The Resolution *modifies* the original decision of June 22, 1998, specifically to *include* the respondents in G.R. No. 113758 in the award of money claims. The original decision was unclear about their inclusion.
*   **Payment Obligation:** Cinderella Marketing Corporation (CMC) is obligated to pay the specified amounts to each named employee. The exact basis for the money claims (e.g., unpaid wages, separation pay, etc.) is not detailed in this resolution, but presumably, the original NLRC decision and the affirmed June 22, 1998 decision, provide that detail.

**Liabilities:**

*   CMC is liable for the total amount of the money claims awarded to all respondents in both G.R. No. 112535 and G.R. No. 113758, as specified in the resolution. Failure to comply will likely result in enforcement proceedings.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Basis of Claims:** The specific legal basis for the monetary awards (e.g., minimum wage violations, illegal dismissal, unpaid overtime, etc.) is *not specified in this resolution itself*.  This requires review of the lower court or NLRC decision upon which this ruling rests. This creates a risk of misinterpreting the claims and potentially challenging their underlying validity (although that opportunity has likely passed).
*   **Calculation of Amounts:** While the resolution lists specific amounts for each respondent, it doesn't detail *how* those amounts were calculated.  This could lead to disputes if CMC believes the calculations are incorrect. A review of the underlying NLRC decision and related documentation will be necessary.
*   **Enforcement Issues:** Although not evident, a review of related cases such as *Cinderella Marketing Corporation vs. NLRC, et al.*, might indicate problems surrounding the enforcement of the monetary awards.
*   **No mention if CMC has filed for Bankruptcy, Insolvency, or rehabilitation:** If the case is closed and CMC files for such, the awards to the individual will be stayed pending the outcome of such filings.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** The basis for money claims is likely rooted in the Labor Code of the Philippines, specifically provisions related to wages, hours of work, termination of employment, and other employee benefits.
*   **Rules of Court:** The resolution itself is based on the Rules of Court regarding motions for clarification and modification of judgments.
*   **Jurisprudence on Money Claims:** General principles in Philippine labor law regarding the computation and award of money claims will be relevant, including doctrines on burden of proof and presumption of regularity in labor proceedings.
*   **This Resolution Modifies Decision:** Review *Cinderella Marketing Corporation vs. NLRC, et al.* G.R. No. 112535 & G.R. No. 113758, (June 22, 1998)

**Recommendations:**

*   **Review the underlying NLRC decision:** Essential to determine the precise legal basis for the money claims and how the amounts were calculated.
*   **Verify Payment Compliance:** Confirm whether CMC has already paid any portion of the awards.
*   **Assess Enforcement Options:** If CMC fails to comply, determine the available enforcement mechanisms, such as writs of execution and garnishment.
*   **Examine relevant legislation:** Examine potentially relevant legislation pertaining to CMC's status, such as if CMC has filed for bankruptcy.
