**Case Summary: People v. Dumagay, G.R. No. 216753 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant, Jesus Dumagay y Suacito, was charged with selling Morphine and Nandrolone Decanoate in a buy-bust operation.
*   PO3 Jimenea acted as poseur-buyer based on a tip from a confidential informant (CI).
*   Appellant was arrested, and allegedly found in possession of the drugs, an unlicensed firearm, ammunition, and a motorcycle.
*   Trial Court convicted him, which the CA affirmed.
*   Supreme Court reversed the CA decision.

**Key Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Validity of Buy-Bust Operation:** The Court acknowledged the validity of the buy-bust operation under the "objective test" (citing *People v. Pagkalinawan*).  Decoy solicitation is permissible.
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):** This is the core of the reversal. The Supreme Court found a fatal break in the chain of custody regarding the seized items.
    *   *Missing Links:* No testimony or stipulations were made about the transport of seized vials from the police station to crime lab and from crime lab to the court. No details about who delivered or received evidence at different locations.
    *   *Failure to Explain Lapses:* The prosecution failed to justify the failure to mark and conduct a physical inventory immediately at the place of arrest (*People v. Ismael*). Allowing exception to the chain of custody if done in nearest police station is an exception not a rule, a failure to comply needs to be explained and justified.
    *   *Corpus Delicti Issues:*  The court highlighted that the RTC incorrectly described the dangerous drug seized as methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) instead of morphine.
*   **Non-Presentation of Key Witnesses:** The prosecution dispensed with the testimonies of SPO1 Gallego (investigating officer) and PCI Diestro (forensic chemist), leading to gaps in the chain of custody and failure to establish proper procedure followed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and establishing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   Law enforcement is obligated to strictly comply with Section 21 of RA 9165, including proper marking, inventory, and documentation. Justifiable grounds are needed to allow failure of full compliance and must be proven.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Acquittal Due to Chain of Custody Issues:** This case underscores the criticality of meticulously documenting and preserving the chain of custody in drug cases. Failing to do so can lead to acquittal, even if a valid buy-bust operation is established.
*   **Corpus Delicti Problems:** Discrepancies in the identification of the seized substance, can lead to failure to prove the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Failure to offer explanations for non-compliance will lead to acquittal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II (Sale of dangerous drugs), Section 21 (Custody and disposition of seized drugs).
*   RA 10640 (Amends Section 21 of RA 9165)
*   *People v. Pagkalinawan* (Valid buy-bust operation and decoy solicitation)
*   *People v. Ismael* (Marking upon arrest at location needed)
*   *People v. Sarap* (Burden to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The case highlights the ambiguous nature of when non-compliance with Section 21 can be excused. The Supreme Court emphasizes the need for demonstrable "justifiable grounds."
*   Stipulation of the witness's testimony, not necessarily the accuracy of the testimony.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody. The court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and providing justifiable reasons for any deviations. This case serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement and prosecutors regarding the meticulous procedures required in drug cases.
