Here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Marlon Casco y Villamer*, G.R. No. 212819 (2018)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Holding:**  Conviction REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accused-Appellant ACQUITTED due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs:
    *   Immediate inventory and photographing after seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, a media representative, and a DOJ representative during inventory; all must sign the inventory.
    *   Submission to PDEA Forensic Laboratory within 24 hours for examination.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Prosecution Failure:** The prosecution failed to prove an unbroken chain of custody and to provide justifiable grounds for deviations from Section 21 requirements. This resulted in the acquittal of the accused.
*   **Presumption of Regularity Misapplication:** The CA erred in relying on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty due to the documented lapses by the police officers, which are themselves evidence of irregularity.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   *People v. Sagana*, G.R. No. 208471 (2017):  The confiscated drug is the *corpus delicti* of the offense.
*   *People v. Callejo*, G.R. No. 227427 (2018): Stresses the need for the presence of the three (3) required witnesses not only during inventory but most importantly at the time or near the place of the buy-bust arrest.
*   *People v. Reyes*, 797 Phil. 671 (2016):  Emphasizes the prosecution's burden to acknowledge and justify lapses in chain of custody.  The saving clause in the IRR of R.A. No. 9165 requires the Prosecution to recognize the lapse or lapses, and justify or explain them.
*   *People v. Catalan*, 699 Phil. 603 (2012): Warns against the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty prevailing over the stronger presumption of innocence favoring the accused.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance with Section 21:** While deviation from Section 21 is permitted in exceptional cases, the prosecution failed to demonstrate any justifiable cause for the blatant non-compliance, particularly the absence of the required witnesses and the failure to immediately mark the evidence at the place of the arrest.
*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:** Several gaps existed in the documented chain of custody: no evidence regarding when and where the seized drug was marked, details on how the specimen was handled from the time it was handed to PO1 Gula to the time it was returned to PO1 Kalbi until it was submitted to PSI Bonifacio for examination was missing.
*   **Defense of Frame-Up:** The court gives credence to the accused's claim of frame-up because of the police officers' deliberate disregard of the requirements under the law.

**Risks & Recommendations for Future Cases:**

*   The prosecution needs to meticulously document and present evidence demonstrating an unbroken chain of custody, including details about handling, storage, and transfer of evidence.
*   Any deviation from Section 21 MUST be explicitly acknowledged, explained, and justified by the prosecution.
*   The trial courts need to ensure that the police operational procedures are followed and to exercise extra vigilance in trying drug cases.
* The National Police Commission is directed to CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION on the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation conducted in this case.
*   The court is reminding prosecutors to diligently discharge their onus to prove compliance with the provisions of Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended, and its IRR, which is fundamental in preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti.
