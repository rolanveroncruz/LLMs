Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *In Re: Report of COA on the Shortage of the Accountabilities of Clerk of Court Lilia S. Buena, MTCC, Naga City.* A.M. No. 95-1-01-MTCC, January 05, 1998

**Nature:** Administrative Case for malversation of public funds.

**Facts:** Lilia S. Buena, Clerk of Court of the MTCC, Naga City, was found short in her accountabilities by P81,650.00 by the COA.  An anonymous tip led to a re-examination revealing discrepancies between the MTCC docket book, cash book, and official receipts. Buena admitted to misappropriating the funds to cover her son's medical expenses. She fully restituted the P81,650.00 shortage and a further JDF deficiency. The Supreme Court investigated based on reports from COA and the Fiscal Audit Division (FAD).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Accountability for Public Funds:** Public officials are accountable for funds entrusted to them (Art. XI, Sec. 1, Philippine Constitution).
*   **Honesty and Probity:** Clerks of Court must maintain the integrity of court records and public confidence.
*   **Restitution:** While restitution of misappropriated funds affects civil liability, it does not extinguish criminal liability (citing *Felicilda vs. Grospe*, 211 SCRA 285).
*   **Violation of R.A. No. 6713:** The Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees was violated.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:**  Buena was found administratively guilty of dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, acts considered grave offenses, normally carrying dismissal (Section 23, Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations).
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** State Auditor charged Buena with malversation under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:**  While typically leading to dismissal, the Court considered Buena's full restitution, sincere repentance, need to save her sons life and long years in public service as mitigating factors.
*   **Penalty:**  The Court, in its discretion, deemed Buena resigned instead of dismissing her, allowing her to claim leave credits and retirement benefits.
*   **Re-employment:**  The original draft of the decision was altered. As it stands, Buena's resignation is without prejudice to re-employment in government service.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217, Revised Penal Code:** Malversation of Public Funds.
*   **Article XI, Section 1, Philippine Constitution:** Public office is a public trust.
*   **R.A. No. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.
