## Legal Document Summary: A.C. No. 1302, 1391, 1543

**Nature:** Decision regarding an appeal for reinstatement to the Bar by Atty. Dionisio C. Antiniw, previously disbarred.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Prior Disbarment:** Atty. Antiniw was disbarred in 1991 for falsifying a notarized deed of sale and introducing it as evidence in court. This violated his duty to the administration of justice ( *Lubiano vs. Gordalla, 115 SCRA 459* ), and duty to the court (*In re: Ivan T. Publico, 102 SCRA 722*).
*   **Repeated Appeals:** Respondent filed numerous petitions, appeals, and pleas for reinstatement, all initially denied.
*   **Evidence of Rehabilitation:** Respondent submitted testimonials and certifications from civic, religious, and government organizations attesting to his good moral character, civic engagement, and unblemished record as a public servant post-disbarment.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** The IBP, through its Commission on Bar Discipline and Board of Governors, recommended Atty. Antiniw's reinstatement.
*   **Court's Rationale:** The Court relies on evidence presented showing contrition, remorse, and rehabilitation. The Court cites *Adez Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 100643* as precedent for lifting disbarment based on similar grounds. The decision emphasizes that the goal of disciplinary proceedings is restorative justice, not retribution (*Dr. Gil Y. Gamilla, et al. v. Atty. Eduardo J. Marino Jr., A.C. No. 4763*).
*   **Reinstatement:** The Court grants Atty. Antiniw's appeal and lifts his disbarment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Legal Fees:** Respondent is required to pay all required legal fees.
*   **Upholding Legal Standards:** Respondent is reminded of the conditions required for remaining a member in good standing of the bar and for enjoying the privilege to practice law.

**Liabilities:**

*   No explicit new liabilities, however the court reminded Respondent to continue adhering to the code of professional responsibility to avoid any further issues.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Misconduct:** While the court expresses confidence in Atty. Antiniw's rehabilitation, any future ethical violations could result in further disciplinary action, including disbarment.
*   **Public Perception:** Reinstatement may be controversial, given the severity of the initial offense.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Santos vs. Dichoso, 84 SCRA 622:** Lawyer owes entire devotion to the interest of his client, but not at the expense of truth.
*   **Cosmos Foundry Shopworkers Union vs. La Bu, 63 SCRA 313:** The duty of a lawyer is not to his client but to the administration of justice
*   **Lubiano vs. Gordalla, 115 SCRA 459:** To that end, his client's success is wholly subordinate. His conduct ought to and must always be scrupulously observant of law and ethics.
*   **Pangan vs Ramos, 93 SCRA 87:** It is the duty of an attorney to employ, for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to him, such means as are consistent with truth and honor
*   **In re: Ivan T. Publico, 102 SCRA 722:** Membership in the Bar is a privilege burdened with conditions. By far, the most important of them is mindfulness that a lawyer is an officer of the court.
*   **Halili vs. CIR, 136 SCRA 112:** This Court may suspend or disbar a lawyer whose acts show his unfitness to continue as a member of the Bar
*   **Noriega vs. Sison 125 SCRA 293:** Disbarment, therefore, is not meant as a punishment depriving him of a source of livelihood but is rather intended to protect the administration of justice by requiring that those who exercise this function should be competent, honorable and reliable in order that courts and the public may rightly repose confidence in them
*   **Adez Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 100643:** Precedent for reinstatement based on remorse and rehabilitation.
*   **Dr. Gil Y. Gamilla, et al. v. Atty. Eduardo J. Marino Jr., A.C. No. 4763:** Restorative justice, not retribution, is the goal of disciplinary proceedings.
*   **Maximo Dumadag v. Atty. Ernesto L. Lumaya, A.C. No. 2614:** The practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions.
*   **Michael P. Barrios v. Atty. Francisco P. Martinez, A.C. No. 4585:** Of all classes and professions, the lawyer is most sacredly bound to uphold the laws, as he is their sworn servant

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent. The decision is straightforward in its rationale and terms.
