Okay, here is a legal summary of *Bai Sandra S. A. Sema v. Commission on Elections and Didagen P. Dilangalen*, G.R. No. 177597, and *Perfecto F. Marquez v. Commission on Elections*, G.R. No. 178628, 580 Phil. 623 (2008), formatted in Markdown.

### Legal Document Summary: *Bai Sandra S. A. Sema v. COMELEC; Perfecto F. Marquez v. COMELEC*

**Case Overview:** Consolidated petitions challenging COMELEC Resolution No. 7902, which treated Cotabato City as part of the legislative district of the newly created Province of Shariff Kabunsuan. The core legal issue revolves around the constitutionality of the ARMM Regional Assembly's power to create provinces and the subsequent implications for legislative district apportionment.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Creation of Shariff Kabunsuan:** The ARMM Regional Assembly, pursuant to Section 19, Article VI of RA 9054 (amending RA 6734), enacted MMA Act 201, creating Shariff Kabunsuan from municipalities formerly part of Maguindanao's first legislative district. Cotabato City, while geographically within the former first district, is *not* part of the ARMM.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 7902:** Amended Resolution No. 07-0407, renaming the legislative district as "Shariff Kabunsuan Province with Cotabato City (formerly First District of Maguindanao with Cotabato City)."
*   **Petitioners' Arguments:** Both petitioners challenge the validity of Resolution 7902. Sema contends that the creation of Shariff Kabunsuan automatically entitles it to a separate legislative district, arguing that the COMELEC overstepped its bounds and usurped Congress' reapportionment power. Marquez, a taxpayer from Cotabato City, similarly argues that the merger of his city with the new province into one legislative district is unlawful.
*   **COMELEC's Defense:** Initially, the COMELEC (through the OSG) argued that Sema improperly sought certiorari to nullify the resolution, and the matter was moot due to the winning candidate's proclamation. Later, the COMELEC changed its position.
*   **Legislative District Apportionment:** The COMELEC, recognizing the Constitutional imperative in Section 5 (3), Article VI, which requires that "each province shall have at least one representative", maintains status quo pending enactment by Congress of an appropriate reapportionment law.
*   **Population Issue:** Cotabato City has a population under 250,000, raising concerns about its qualification as a standalone legislative district under Section 5(3), Article VI.

**Ruling:**

*   **Unconstitutionality of ARMM's Province Creation Power:** The Supreme Court declared Section 19, Article VI of RA 9054 *unconstitutional* insofar as it grants the ARMM Regional Assembly the power to create provinces and cities. The court reasoned that creating provinces inherently involves creating legislative districts, a power *exclusively* vested in Congress by Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution.
*   **Invalidity of MMA Act 201:** Consequently, MMA Act 201, which created Shariff Kabunsuan, was declared *void*.
*   **Validity of COMELEC Resolution No. 7902:** Because Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution delegates the power to apportion legislative districts to the Congress, the COMELEC Resolution 7902 was declared *valid* as it maintained the status quo.

**Key Legal Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Delegation of Legislative Power:** The case hinges on the non-delegability doctrine. Can Congress delegate its power to create/reapportion legislative districts to a regional assembly? The Court answers "no".
*   **Section 5, Article VI, Constitution:** This provision is central, addressing the composition of the House of Representatives and legislative district apportionment. The Court interprets it as granting Congress *exclusive* authority over reapportionment and creation of legislative districts.
*   **Section 10, Article X, Constitution:** Requires compliance with the Local Government Code's criteria for creating local government units and approval via plebiscite.  While the ARMM complied with the plebiscite, the delegation itself was invalid.
*   ***Felwa v. Salas*, 124 Phil. 1226 (1966):**  The Court distinguishes *Felwa*, where Congress directly created provinces via statute. *Felwa* doesn't apply when a *regional* body attempts to create a province, triggering the constitutional issue of legislative apportionment.
*   **Local Autonomy vs. National Legislative Power:** The court balances the constitutional mandate for local autonomy in the ARMM against the need to maintain Congress's exclusive control over the national legislature's composition. Autonomy cannot supersede express constitutional limitations.
*   ***Tobias v. Abalos*, G.R. No. 114783, 8 December 1994, 239 SCRA 106:** The court held that a law converting Mandaluyong into a city could likewise serve the purpose of increasing the composition of the House of Representatives.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact on ARMM's Autonomy:** This decision significantly curtails the ARMM's ability to shape its internal political landscape.
*   **Future Province Creation:** Any future attempt to create provinces within the ARMM would require an act of Congress, limiting the region's self-determination.
*   **Practical Implications:** Reverting Shariff Kabunsuan to its previous status creates administrative and political disruptions.
*   **Potential Contentious Issues:** The Dissenting and Concurring opinion raises valid concerns regarding how this ruling has dealt another severe blow to the cause of local autonomy.&#x20;

**Case Law Summary:** The ruling reinforces the principle that the power to apportion legislative districts is a *national* legislative prerogative, specifically reserved for Congress. Local autonomy, while constitutionally protected, is subordinate to this express allocation of power.&#x20;
