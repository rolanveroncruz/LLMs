Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution, focusing on key elements relevant for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Eufracio B. Pilipiña vs. Juanito R. Roxas*, A.M. No. P-08-2423, March 6, 2008

**Nature:** Administrative Matter (Misconduct/Simple Neglect of Duty)

**Facts:**

*   Sheriff Pilipiña received P3,000 from Alpadi Development Corporation (ADC) to implement a writ of execution in *ADC v. Cedilla*.
*   Pilipiña gave the P3,000 to Respondent Roxas (OIC-Branch Clerk of Court) for "safekeeping" and ease of withdrawal, as the scheduled enforcement was a few days away. Roxas issued a receipt.
*   The Supreme Court (SC) treated this act as a violation of Section 9, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court (now Section 10, Revised Rule 141 as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC).

**Issue:**

Whether Roxas's act of receiving the P3,000 constituted a violation of Section 9, Rule 141, specifically regarding the procedure for depositing and disbursing sheriff's expenses.

**Ruling:**

The SC found Roxas **GUILTY** of **Simple Neglect of Duty**.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Section 9, Rule 141 (now Section 10, Revised Rule 141):** This rule mandates that sheriff's expenses be:
    *   Estimated by the sheriff
    *   Approved by the Court
    *   Deposited with the Clerk of Court and *ex-officio* Sheriff
    *   Disbursed by the Clerk of Court to the deputy sheriff
    *   Liquidated with a report and return
    *   Excess refunded.
*   **Violation:** Roxas, as OIC-Branch Clerk, was not authorized to receive the deposit.  The SC emphasized that the deposit must be made with the Clerk of Court and *ex-officio* Sheriff.
*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** Defined as the failure to give proper attention to a required task due to carelessness or indifference. The court cited *Tiu v. De la Cruz*, A.M. No. P-06-2288, 15 June 2007 and *Sangil Vda. de Dizon v. Tensuan*, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1943, 9 August 2005, 466 SCRA 68, 77.
*   **Rationale:**  The SC stressed the importance of Clerks of Court in the judicial system and their duty to ensure proper adherence to procedures by court personnel. The Court cited *Loyao, Jr. v. Caube, 450 Phil. 45 (2003)* and *Angeles v. Eduarte, 457 Phil. 56 (2003)* to emphasize the role of clerks of court. Neglect of duty, even simple neglect, erodes public confidence in the judiciary. The court cited *Office of the Court Administrator v. Paredes, A.M. No. P-06-2103, 17 April 2007.*

**Penalties:**

*   Suspension for one (1) month
*   Order to turn over the P3,000 to the Clerk of Court and *ex-officio* Sheriff within 5 days.
*   Warning that repetition would warrant a more severe penalty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Safekeeping vs. Deposit:** Roxas argued he accepted the money for "safekeeping," not as the deposit required by Rule 141. The SC rejected this argument, implying any acceptance of funds related to sheriff's expenses outside the prescribed procedure constitutes a violation.
*   **Lack of Intent:** Pilipiña explicitly stated he didn't intend to file a complaint against Roxas. However, the SC *motu proprio* treated Pilipiña's statement as an administrative complaint.  This highlights the Court's power to initiate disciplinary proceedings even without a formal complaint.
*   **Strict Liability Interpretation:** The ruling implies a strict liability interpretation of Rule 141. Even with no malicious intent or actual misuse of funds, failing to follow the precise deposit procedure constitutes simple neglect.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Tiu v. De la Cruz*, A.M. No. P-06-2288, 15 June 2007.
*   *Sangil Vda. de Dizon v. Tensuan*, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1943, 9 August 2005, 466 SCRA 68, 77.
*   *Loyao, Jr. v. Caube, 450 Phil. 45 (2003)*
*   *Angeles v. Eduarte, 457 Phil. 56 (2003)*
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Paredes, A.M. No. P-06-2103, 17 April 2007.*

**Key Takeaways:**

This case serves as a strong reminder to court personnel regarding strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly those relating to the handling of funds. It underscores that even seemingly minor deviations from established procedures can result in administrative liability, even in the absence of malicious intent. It also highlights the duty of clerks of court to ensure other court personnel are following prescribed procedures.
