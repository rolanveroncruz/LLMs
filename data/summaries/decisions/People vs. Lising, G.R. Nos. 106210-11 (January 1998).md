## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lising, G.R. Nos. 106210-11 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a trial court decision finding the accused guilty of double murder (qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation and abuse of public position), and slight illegal detention (later modified to Kidnapping).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** The case involves the abduction and murder of Ernesto Bernabe II ("Cochise") and Ana Lourdes Castaños ("Beebom"). The accused, including police officers (Lising, Dizon, Manga) and private individuals (Manalili, Garcia), conspired to abduct and kill Cochise and Beebom. The court found that the victims were initially kidnapped and then murdered in a warehouse owned by Fausto, a private individual but who was acquitted.
*   **Charges:** Rodolfo Manalili, Roberto “Rambo” Lising, Felimon Garcia, Robin Manga and Enrico Dizon were all guilty of the crime of Double Murder qualified with treachery and aggravated by evidence premeditation and abused of public position by Lising, Manga and Dizon,
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found that the accused acted in concert, demonstrating a unity of purpose and intention in committing the crimes. The court found the existence of conspiracy in the interlocking confessions of Manalili, Garcia, and Lising.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The court relied heavily on the eyewitness testimony of Froilan Olimpia and Raul Morales, which it deemed credible. Olimpia witnessed the abduction, and Morales witnessed events surrounding the murder, which was consistent with the rest of the evidence.
*   **Extrajudicial Statements:** The extrajudicial statements of Manalili, Garcia, and Lising were admitted, finding them voluntary, and their statements "interlocked."

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The court sentenced Rodolfo Manalili, Roberto “Rambo” Lising, Felimon Garcia, Robin Manga, and Enrico Dizon to suffer the penalty of double Reclusion Perpetua with all its accessory penalties provided by law to pay jointly and severally the heirs of Ernesto Bernabe II; as funeral and other expenses; compensatory damages; moral damages; and the heirs of Ana Lourdes Castaños funeral and other expenses; compensatory damages; moral damages.

*   The Court also found Roberto Lising, Enrico Dizon and Robin Manga guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Slight Illegal Detention aggravated by use of a motor vehicle and hereby sentences each one of them to suffer the maximum penalty of Reclusion Temporal with imprisonment from Seventeen (17) years, Four (4) months and one (1) day to Twenty years, and to pay the cost. This was subsequently modified to Kidnapping.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Admissibility of Extrajudicial Statements:** The appellants argued that the extrajudicial statements of co-accused were inadmissible against them. The court, however, relied on the "interlocking confessions" exception to the general rule against admissibility.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. The court stated that the trial court's assessment of witness credibility should be given great respect.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The trial court's exoneration of Manalili and Garcia on kidnapping charges. However, these parties still faced Reclusion Perpetua for the double murder case.

Maria, 15 SCRA 222 (1965):** Extrajudicial statements are evidence only against the person making it, there also recognizes various exceptions. One such exception worth noting is the rule that where several extrajudicial statements had been made by several persons charged with an offense and there could have been no collusion with reference to said several confessions, the facts that the statements are in all material respects identical, is confirmatory of the confession of the co-defendants and is admissible against other persons implicated therein.

Pelagio, 20 SCRA 153, 159-160 [1967]:** One who joins a criminal conspiracy in effect adopts as his own the criminal designs of his co-conspirators; he merges his will into the common felonious intent. A person who embraces a criminal conspiracy is properly held to have casts his lot with his fellow conspirators and to have taken his chances that things may go awry and that the offended party may resists or third persons may get killed in the course of implementing the basic criminal design. To free himself from such criminal liability, the law requires some overt act on the part of the conspirator, to seek to prevent commission of the second or related felony or to abandon or dissociate himself from the conspiracy to commit the initial felony. (People v. Salvador, 163 SCRA 574, 580-582 [1988]; People v. Bazar, 162 SCRA 609, 617 [1988]; People v. Escober, 157 SCRA 541 567 [1988]; People v. Pelagio, 20 SCRA 153, 159-160 [1967]” (Italics supplied).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision finding the accused guilty of double murder, based on the strong eyewitness testimony and corroborating extrajudicial statements and also convicted some for kidnapping.
