Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Caridad Pacheco vs. Jimmy F. Reyes* (G.R. No. 268216, February 26, 2024)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari. The underlying case is an Unlawful Detainer action.

**Facts:**

*   Jimmy Reyes (Respondent) claims possession of property based on a Subrogation/Transfer of Rights.
*   Caridad Pacheco (Petitioner) and her late husband were lessees of the property under a contract with Reyes, paying PHP 6,000/month rent.
*   The Pachecos stopped paying rent in April 2017.
*   Reyes made demands to pay and vacate, but the Pachecos remained.
*   Reyes filed an Unlawful Detainer case with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC).
*   The Pachecos claimed ownership of the property, asserting a claim adverse to Reyes and arguing prescription based on alleged open and continuous possession for over 30 years.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **MeTC:** Ruled in favor of Reyes, finding all elements of Unlawful Detainer present. Relied on the lease contract and the principle of estoppel under Section 2(b), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court (tenant cannot deny landlord's title). Ordered the Pachecos to vacate, pay unpaid rentals (from Feb 2019), attorney's fees, and costs.
*   **RTC:** Affirmed the MeTC's decision, upholding the estoppel argument under Section 2(b) of Rule 131.

**Court of Appeals (CA) Ruling:**

*   Dismissed Pacheco's Petition for Certiorari outright.
*   Reasoning: Improper remedy (should have been an appeal under Rule 42).  The CA also noted that even if treated as an appeal, it was filed late.
*   Additional procedural defects: Lack of proper Verification and Certification Against Forum Shopping and failure to attach all relevant documents.

**Issue:**

Did the CA commit reversible error in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari?

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **HELD: No reversible error.** The CA's dismissal was correct.
*   **Wrong Mode of Appeal:** The Supreme Court concurred that the Petition for Certiorari was the wrong remedy.  An appeal under Rule 42 was the proper course, as the RTC decision was rendered in its appellate jurisdiction. *Rodis v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 215010, July 29, 2020, highlights the need for Rule 42 appeals from RTC appellate decisions.
*   **Procedural Defects:** The Court found that the procedural lapses (lack of proper verification and certification against forum shopping, incomplete document submission) were not merely technicalities that could be excused under substantial compliance. *Quitalig v. Quitalig*, G.R. No. 207958, August 4, 2021, was cited for its guidelines on verification and certification against forum shopping.
*   **Untimely Filing:** Even if the Petition for Certiorari were treated as a Rule 42 Petition for Review, it was filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The RTC decision had become final and executory due to the lapse of the appeal period.
*   **Rules on Expedited Procedures Inapplicable:** A.M. No. 08-8-7-SC (Rules on Expedited Procedures in the First Level Courts) does not apply retroactively to this case.

**Key Provisions and Liabilities:**

*   **Contract of Lease:**  Creates the landlord-tenant relationship and defines the terms of occupancy and payment.
*   **Section 2(b), Rule 131, Rules of Court:**  Establishes the principle of estoppel, preventing a tenant from denying the landlord's title.
*   **Rule 42, Rules of Court:** Outlines the procedure for appealing RTC decisions made in its appellate jurisdiction.
*   **A.M. No. 08-8-7-SC (Rules on Expedited Procedures in the First Level Courts):**  Governs procedure for specific cases but does not apply retroactively here.
*   **Liability:** The Pachecos were held liable for unpaid rentals, attorney's fees, and the obligation to vacate the property.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** While the Unlawful Detainer action does not directly decide ownership, the Pachecos' claim of ownership based on the Deed of Assignment of Real Property presented a collateral issue.  The Court avoided addressing this beyond the estoppel issue.
*   **Prescription:**  The Pachecos' argument of prescription was effectively rejected due to the lease agreement and the unlawful detainer action.
*   **Procedural Compliance:** The case highlights the critical importance of strict compliance with procedural rules. Failure to properly verify pleadings and file within the prescribed timeframes can be fatal to a case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court doesn't delve into the validity of the Subrogation/Transfer of Rights document transferring rights to Reyes or the Deed of Assignment of Real Property submitted by the Pachecos. The court did not make a pronouncement on the true owner of the property.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal, emphasizing adherence to procedural rules and finding that the Pachecos pursued the wrong appellate remedy. The ruling reinforces the principle of estoppel in landlord-tenant relationships and underscores the finality of judgments when appeals are not timely and properly perfected.
