**Legal Document Summary: Pasiona v. Court of Appeals, et al. (G.R. No. 165471, July 21, 2008)**

**Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) ruling that upheld San Miguel Corporation's (SMC) termination of Emeterio Pasiona, Jr.'s employment.  The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employee Termination:** SMC terminated Pasiona's employment for gross negligence, withholding of funds, and insubordination stemming from alleged violations of company policies (unauthorized check acceptance, irregularities in price rollback transactions, non-compliance with receipt procedures, and improper vale issuances).
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Labor Arbiter (LA) initially ruled the dismissal illegal, ordering reinstatement and backwages.
    *   NLRC reversed, finding the dismissal valid and legal but ordering payment of commissions.
    *   CA affirmed the NLRC.
*   **Finality of Judgment:**  The CA decision became final and executory. Pasiona then filed a Petition for Certiorari with the SC, arguing denial of due process due to his former counsel's negligence in failing to file a timely motion for reconsideration.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employee's Obligation:** To adhere to company policies and act with honesty and fidelity in handling company funds and transactions.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** To provide due process in disciplinary actions (notice and opportunity to be heard). SMC appears to have met this obligation.
*   **Liability:**  The NLRC ordered SMC to pay Pasiona commissions from December 1999 until the decision's promulgation, and affirmed the LA's order for a one-time gift payment of P19,440 representing a one-time gift given by Eduardo M. Cojuanco, Jr.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process Claim:** Pasiona argued that his former counsel's negligence deprived him of due process. The SC rejected this argument, stating he had ample opportunity to be heard at all stages of the proceedings.
*   **Finality of Judgement:** The SC strongly adheres to the doctrine of finality of judgement. The SC stated that there was no clear establishment that his counsel's failure to notify him of the CA Decision and move for reconsideration thereof deprived him of due process. The petition was too late to be ruled on.
*   **Choice of Remedy:** The SC emphasized that the proper remedy to assail a CA Decision is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, not a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, which is only proper when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the course of law.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  Petition for Certiorari.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Appeal by Certiorari from the CA.
*   **Alcantara v. Ponce (G.R. No. 131547, December 15, 2005):**  Doctrine of finality of judgment.
*   **Juani v. Alarcon (G.R. No. 166849, September 5, 2006):**  Immutability of final judgments.
*   **Grande v. University of the Philippines, (G.R. No. 148456, September 15, 2006):** Clients are bound by the actions or mistakes of his counsel, the only exception being, when such counsel's negligence is so gross and palpable resulting in the denial of due process to his client.
*   **Iloilo La Filipina Uygongco Corporation v.Court of Appeals, (G.R. No. 170244, November 28, 2007):** Proper remedy to assail a CA Decision is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, not a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether Pasiona's actions constituted "just cause" for termination under the Labor Code is a contentious point. While the NLRC and CA found just cause, the Labor Arbiter initially disagreed. The gravity of the offenses, balanced against the length of service, could be argued.
*   The failure of Pasiona's counsel to inform him of the CA decision and file a motion for reconsideration.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC upheld the CA decision primarily on procedural grounds (finality of judgment and improper remedy) and ruled that there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the CA and NLRC. The risk for Pasiona is that the SC ruled that the CA ruling was final and unappealable.
