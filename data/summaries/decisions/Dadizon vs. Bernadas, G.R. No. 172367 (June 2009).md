## Legal Document Summary: *Dadizon v. Bernadas* (G.R. No. 172367)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's Order approving a Project of Partition.  The original case was for partition of the estate of the late Diosdado Bernadas, Sr.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's approval of a Project of Partition not signed by all parties, circumventing the procedure mandated by Rule 69 of the Rules of Court regarding partition of real estate.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in the affirmative, reversed the CA and RTC decisions, and remanded the case to the RTC for appointment of commissioners.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 69 (Rules of Court):** This is the central statutory reference, governing actions for partition. Specifically, Sections 2 and 3, which outline the two methods for partition.
    *   **Section 2:** Allows parties to agree on a partition by proper instruments of conveyance, which the court then confirms. **Obligation:** Requires complete agreement and execution of proper documents by *all* parties in interest.
    *   **Section 3:** Mandates appointment of commissioners to make partition when parties fail to agree. **Obligation:** Requires the Court to appoint commissioners when the parties cannot come to an agreement.
*   **Decedent's Estate:** The core issue involves the division of the estate of Diosdado Bernadas, Sr., who died intestate. All of the parties are children and representatives of deceased children of the deceased.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Partition:** The RTC's approval of the Project of Partition without all signatures renders it invalid. A significant risk involves the improper distribution of assets. The Court's order is designed to prevent that from happening.
*   **Delay & Increased Costs:** The improper procedure has resulted in significant delays and protracted litigation. The case must be restarted with new commissioners.
*   **Disputes over Ownership:** The potential for further disputes arising from misallocation of property in the future if the correct procedures were not followed are obvious.
*   **Reversal Benefits Non-Appealing Parties:** SC clarified that a reversal benefits all parties concerned as heirs, regardless of whether they appealed.
*   **Pending Civil Case B-1091:** The SC notes the existence of Civil Case No. B-1091 (filed by the mother, Eustaquia Bernadas) seeking to annul the sales of her conjugal share to respondent Socorro Bernadas.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 69, Rules of Court (Partition):** The foundation for the Court's reasoning.
*   ***De Mesa v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. No. 109387):** Trial court cannot compel a party to sign an extrajudicial deed of partition prepared solely by others; commissioners must be appointed if parties cannot agree.
*   ***Patricio v. Dario III*** **(G.R. No. 170829):** Trial court cannot order sale by public auction before attempt partition with commissioners.
*   ***Heirs of Zoilo Llido v. Marquez*** **(G.R. No. L-37079):** Failure to submit project of partition justifies appointment of commissioners.
*   ***Honorio v. Dunuan*** **(G.R. No. L-38999):** Over objection of parties, the parties need to have proper commissioners appointed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Agreement on Partition:** The RTC and CA relied on the parties' apparent agreement on the partition manner.  The SC found this insufficient absent signatures on the Project of Partition.
*   **Failure to Comment:** Petitioners' failure to comment on the Project of Partition was wrongly interpreted as consent.
*   **The issue of the validity of extrajudicial settlement where some heirs may not have participated nor signed the document.**

**Potential Actions:**

*   **Appointment of Commissioners:** The RTC must appoint competent and disinterested commissioners to perform the partition under Rule 69, Sections 3-6.
*   **Assessment of Partition:** Must be made to determine the best way to go about the physical partition of the real estate.
*   **Consideration of Annulment Case:** Civil Case No. B-1091 must be considered to resolve ownership disputes that may affect the partition.

**Risks:**

*   Continued disagreement among the heirs could significantly prolong the proceedings.
*   Valuation of properties and determination of fair shares could lead to further disputes.
*   The ongoing annulment case presents a significant contingency that could alter the allocation of assets.
