Okay, here's a legal summary of *Jose Max S. Ortiz v. San Miguel Corporation*, G.R. Nos. 151983-84, July 31, 2008, formatted in markdown.

**Case Summary: *Jose Max S. Ortiz v. San Miguel Corporation***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to modify the CA decision regarding attorney's fees awarded in labor cases (NLRC Cases No. V-0255-94 and No. V-0068-95).

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioner (Ortiz, counsel for complainants in the NLRC cases) is entitled to attorney's fees based on the original monetary award adjudged by the NLRC, or only on the amounts actually paid to complainants after they signed Deeds of Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim (Quitclaims).

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court *denied* the petition. Ortiz is not entitled to attorney's fees based on the original NLRC award, nor does he have the standing to file the petition.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Attorney's Fees (Article 111, Labor Code):** The Court emphasizes that Article 111 of the Labor Code contemplates *extraordinary* attorney's fees, meaning they are awarded to the *client* (complainants) as indemnity for damages, unless a specific agreement exists for it to be considered part of compensation for his legal services. *PCL Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* reiterates this point.

*   **Deeds of Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim:**  The court upholds the validity of the Quitclaims, even without Ortiz's specific conformity. The requirements for validity are met: no fraud, credible consideration, and not contrary to law or public policy. The fact that the employees settled for lesser amounts after the NLRC award impacts the determination of attorney's fees.

*   **Real Party in Interest:** The Court finds that Ortiz is *not* the real party in interest. He is not the party who would be benefited or injured by the judgment regarding the attorney's fees because those were awarded to his clients initially. Also, because the complainants agreed to deduct 10% from the amounts they were actually settling for, Ortiz already got paid the attorney’s fees owed to him.

*   **Amount of "Wages Recovered" (Art. 111):** The Court interprets "wages recovered" in Article 111 to be the amounts the complainants *actually received* through the Quitclaims, not the original NLRC award.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Malpractice Claim:** If Ortiz pressured clients into pursuing the case against their will or failed to adequately advise them regarding settlement options, he may face a malpractice claim.
*   **Ethical Violations:** The Court explicitly reminded him that legal practice is not simply a money-making trade, and that compensation is but a mere incident. This hints at possible ethical concerns arising from his pursuit of additional fees.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Article 111
*   Civil Code, Article 2208
*   Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 3, Section 2
* *St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC and Bienvenido Aricayos*
* *PCL Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission*
* *Dr. Reyes v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Traders Royal Bank Employees Union-Independent v. National Labor Relations Commission*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the clause in the Deeds related to attorney's fees amounted to a clear agreement that the entire NLRC award of attorney's fees was meant to be considered his as compensation. The Court found the Deeds to be clear that the 10% was to be deducted from what the complainants were agreeing to settle for and not to indicate that they agreed he was entitled to the attorney's fees from the NLRC award.

**Conclusion:**

This decision reinforces the importance of properly documented agreements regarding attorney's fees, especially in labor cases. It confirms that employees can settle their claims even without counsel's approval and that any statutory attorney’s fees are tied to the settlement amounts received. It also highlights the ethical obligations of attorneys to prioritize justice over financial gain. Ortiz's claim fails because the attorney's fees belonged to the clients, the Quitclaims were valid, and he already received compensation tied to the settlement amounts.
