Okay, here's a legal summary and analysis of the provided case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Heirs of Geminiano Francisco, et al. v. Court of Appeals, Wellington Velasco, et al.* G.R. No. 215599, November 28, 2018 (844 Phil. 168)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 filed by the Heirs of Francisco (Petitioners) against the Court of Appeals (CA) and Wellington Velasco, challenging the CA's Resolution that denied their Motion for Reconsideration and ordered an Entry of Judgment. The CA ruled that the Motion for Reconsideration was filed beyond the reglementary period.  The core dispute concerns the ownership of a 20-hectare parcel of land in Zamboanga City (Lot No. 9, Cad. 124, Boalan). The Petitioners had filed a complaint for Annulment of Title, Reconveyance of Real Property, and Damages against Velasco, claiming ownership through their ancestor's alleged occupation since 1918. Velasco countered, claiming lawful ownership under Original Certificate of Title No. P-3,760 and invoking *res judicata* based on a prior judgment (MNR Case No. 6099).  The RTC granted Velasco's demurrer to evidence, dismissing the Petitioners' complaint for insufficiency of evidence and improper remedy. The CA affirmed the dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Filing of Motion for Reconsideration:** The petitioners are required to file their Motion for Reconsideration within 15 days from notice of the CA's Decision. (Rule 52, Rules of Court)
*   **Modes of Filing:** Pleadings must be filed either by personal filing or by registered mail. (Section 3, Rule 13, Rules of Court)
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Petitioners bear the burden of proving that their Motion for Reconsideration was timely filed. (MOF Company, Inc. v. Shin Yang Brokerage Corp., 623 Phil. 424, 436 (2009))

**Liabilities:**

*   The Petitioners are liable for the consequences of failing to file their Motion for Reconsideration within the prescribed period.
*   The Petitioners' failure to present evidence of timely filing resulted in the affirmation of CA ruling and consequently, dismissal of the case.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of CA Decision:** Because the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed untimely, the CA decision became final and executory. This puts the Petitioners at risk of losing their claim to the land.
*   **Rule 65 Petition Failure:**  Certiorari will only lie if there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The court found no such abuse.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mode of Filing:** The use of a private courier service for filing the Motion for Reconsideration is a contentious point, as it is not a recognized mode of filing under the Rules of Court.  Even if considered, the Petitioners failed to provide proof of timely dispatch.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The key problem for the Petitioners was their failure to comply with the procedural rules for filing a Motion for Reconsideration. The court explicitly stated that filing via private courier is not a recognized method, and even assuming *arguendo* it was acceptable, the Petitioners failed to prove the date of dispatch. The Court strictly applied the rules regarding the 15-day period for filing a Motion for Reconsideration. Given this ruling, the Petitioners' chances of overturning the CA decision are extremely low. Any further action would likely need to focus on extraordinary circumstances to warrant a relaxation of the rules, which is difficult given the lack of evidence supporting timely filing and the clear procedural violations. The case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules and the need to properly document the filing of pleadings. The Court's reliance on technical rules rather than the merits of the land dispute is noteworthy.
