**Re: Summary of A.M. No. P-04-1765, Judge Felipe G. Banzon vs. Ruby B. Hechanova**

This document is a *per curiam* resolution from the Philippine Supreme Court addressing administrative charges of gross neglect of duty against Ruby B. Hechanova (Respondent), a Court Stenographer III, for continued refusal to transcribe stenographic notes despite repeated orders.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Obligation to Transcribe Notes:** Respondent was obligated to transcribe stenographic notes within 20 days of taking them, per Administrative Circular No. 24-90, paragraph 2(a). Failure to transcribe notes constitutes a violation of Sec. 17, paragraph 1, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Duty to Submit Transcripts:** The Respondent was obliged to submit transcripts immediately after transcription and not later than 20 days from the time the notes were taken.
*   **Restrictions on Resignation:** Administrative Circular No. 24-90, paragraph 5, disallows a stenographer's resignation before all stenographic notes are transcribed.
*   **Orders and Directives:** Repeated court orders, including those from the Supreme Court, directed the respondent to transcribe the notes.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty:** The Court found the Respondent guilty of gross neglect of duty under Rule IV Section 52, A2 of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19, s. 1999. The court considers failure to transcribe notes a serious offence that is punishable by dismissal even for a first offence.
*   **Sanction:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits (except accrued leave credits), and disqualification from re-employment in any government branch or agency.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Prior Submission/Lost Notes:** The Respondent's claims of prior submission of TSNs and the assertion that some cases were decided or dismissed due to lost notes were directly refuted by the Complainant.
*   **Humanitarian Appeal:** Respondent's appeals based on the death of her husband and the health of her parents were initially considered, resulting in a temporary stay of the arrest order, but ultimately failed to excuse her continued non-compliance.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** The NBI's inability to locate the Respondent highlights potential challenges in enforcing the Court's directives and the eventual penalty.
*   **Ambiguity:** While the timeframe for transcription (20 days) is clear, the specific consequences of *minor* delays or acceptable excuses are not detailed, leaving room for discretionary interpretation. The court appears unsympathetic to potential mitigating factors.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 136, Section 17, Paragraph 1, Rules of Court:** Defines the duties of a stenographer.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Details rules on transcription, including the 20-day deadline and restrictions on resignation.
*   **Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19, s. 1999:** Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, specifically Rule IV Section 52, A2 regarding gross neglect of duty.
* Alcover v. Bacatan, A.M. No. P-05-2043, December 7, 2005, 476 SCRA 607, 612
* Reyes v. Bautista, A.M. No. P-04-1873, January 13, 2005, 448 SCRA 95, 102; Ceniza-Guevarra v. Magbanua, 363 Phil. 454, 459 (1999).

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the importance of timely transcription of stenographic notes for the efficient administration of justice. The ruling reflects a zero-tolerance approach to non-compliance with court orders, even in the face of potentially mitigating circumstances. The case serves as a strong deterrent against negligence by court personnel.
