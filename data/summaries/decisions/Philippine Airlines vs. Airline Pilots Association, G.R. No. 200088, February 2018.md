**Legal Document Summary: Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines, G.R. No. 200088**

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court regarding a petition for review on certiorari concerning jurisdiction over a claim for damages arising from an illegal strike.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Core Issue:** Whether the Labor Arbiter (LA) and National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) have jurisdiction over Philippine Airlines' (PAL) claims for damages against the Airline Pilots Association of the Philippines (ALPAP) and its members, incurred as a consequence of their actions during an illegal strike in 1998.
*   **Background:** ALPAP staged a strike despite a DOLE Secretary of Labor and Employment (SOLE) order prohibiting it. The SOLE declared the strike illegal, and this was upheld by the Court of Appeals (CA) and the Supreme Court. Subsequently, PAL filed a complaint for damages with the LA.
*   **LA and NLRC Rulings:** Both initially dismissed PAL's complaint, citing lack of jurisdiction and prescription. The NLRC modified the LA ruling, emphasizing that claims for damages are more appropriately ventilated before regular courts given that they are based on the tortuous acts allegedly committed by the respondents.
*   **CA Ruling:** Partially granted PAL's petition, affirming that the LA and NLRC lacked jurisdiction but ruling that PAL's cause of action had *not* prescribed and that jurisdiction lies with regular courts.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Partially meritorious. The Supreme Court set aside the CA decision and reinstated the LA decision to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Jurisdiction over actions for damages arising from a labor strike** Labor tribunals have jurisdiction under Art. 217 (now Article 224) of the Labor Code, as amended by Section 9 of RA 6715.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The case revolves around the potential liability of ALPAP and its members for damages caused to PAL as a result of the illegal strike.
*   The primary obligation lies with ALPAP to compensate PAL for actual damages if the strike was indeed illegal and directly caused those damages. However, the Court ultimately ruled that the claim for damages was deemed included in the main controversy concerning the legality of the strike over which the SOLE had assumed jurisdiction. As a result, PAL's failure to raise the claim during the pendency of the illegal strike case before the SOLE is deemed waived.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Split Jurisdiction:** The primary risk PAL faced was the fragmentation of legal proceedings. The Court emphasized the principle against split jurisdiction, which the appellate court's decision had violated by suggesting that a separate complaint should be filed before the trial court.
*   **Prescription:** The Supreme Court did not explicitly deal with the CA's ruling on prescription given its ruling on jurisdiction. However, it indirectly touched on the same issue in pointing out that PAL had only itself to blame given that it was already aware that it had sustained damages even before the SOLE issued its resolution.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217 [now Article 224] of the Labor Code (R.A. No. 6715, Section 9):** Determines the jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the NLRC, particularly regarding claims for damages arising from employer-employee relations.
*   **Article 263(g) of the Labor Code:** Grants SOLE the authority to resolve questions arising from labor disputes over which it assumed jurisdiction.
*   **R.A. No. 875 (Industrial Peace Act):** The Court draws parallels with previous jurisprudence under this Act in relation to jurisdiction over labor disputes and incidental matters.
*   ***Goodrich Employees Association v. Hon. Flores***: Emphasizes that cases involving unfair labor practices are within the jurisdiction of labor tribunals, which must also have jurisdiction over incidental matters connected to the main issue.
*   ***Holganza v. Hon. Apostol***: Reaffirms the exclusive jurisdiction of labor tribunals over actions for damages arising from labor controversies.
*   ***Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company v. Free Telephone Workers Union***: Reiterates that regular courts lack jurisdiction over claims for damages arising from a labor strike.
*   ***Antipolo Highway Lines Employees Union v. Hon. Aquino***: An illegal strike and picket were held to be mere incidents of the labor dispute between the parties.
*   ***National Federation of Labor v. Hon. Eisma***: Decided under the Labor Code. The exclusive original jurisdiction of a labor arbiter is explicitly provided for.

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

This case concerns the jurisdiction of labor tribunals versus regular courts over claims for damages arising from an illegal strike. The Supreme Court ruled that the CA erred in holding that regular courts had jurisdiction. The SOLE, by assuming jurisdiction over the labor dispute, also assumed jurisdiction over all related controversies, including PAL's claim for damages. The Court held that the CA's decision violates the proscription against splitting of jurisdiction. PAL's recourse should have been through the SOLE, and its failure to raise the claim there constitutes a waiver. The final resolution of the illegal strike case by the Supreme Court precludes relitigation of the damages claim due to immutability of final judgment. Therefore, the CA decision was reversed, and the LA decision dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction was reinstated.
