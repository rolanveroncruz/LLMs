**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-09-2636**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Liza O. Galvez, Officer-in-Charge (OIC)-Clerk of Court of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Pateros City, Branch 73, for grave misconduct and conduct unbecoming a court employee.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Galvez issued a certified photocopy of a *spurious* decision dated December 16, 1974 and an undated certificate of finality of the said decision. The decision purported to annul a marriage.
*   The decision was presented as evidence in a separate case to invalidate a later divorce and stop alimony payments.
*   RTC declared the questioned Decision as null and void.
*   Galvez admitted to certifying the document despite the absence of records to support it, relying instead on (1) a duplicate copy shown to her by a third party, (2) comparison of the signature to other documents signed by the same judge.
*   No official receipt was produced for the issuance of the certifications.

**Obligations:**

*   Court personnel have a constitutionally mandated duty to serve with responsibility, integrity, and efficiency (Constitution).
*   Court personnel must perform official duties properly and with diligence (Section 1, Canon IV of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel).
*   Clerks of court have a duty to accurately certify documents under the seal of the court and must have records to verify truthfulness and authenticity (Rule 136 - Court Record and General Duties of Clerks and Stenographers).
*   Duty to promote a high standard of ethics and utmost responsibility in public service (Rep. Act No. 6713).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty:** Failure to exercise due diligence in verifying the authenticity of the decision before certification. Galvez certified a document despite no supporting court records ( Judge Divina Luz P. Aquino-Simbulan v. Judge Nicasio Bartolome).
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** The Court notes that Galvez's actions are tantamount to falsification under the Revised Penal Code [Art. 171]. (see the elements of the violation within)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Good Faith:** Galvez's defense of good faith was rejected due to her knowledge of the lack of supporting records. This highlights the risk of relying on this defense when actual knowledge of irregularities exists.
*   **Mitigation of First Offense:** While Galvez claimed this was a first offense, the gravity of the misconduct outweighed this mitigating factor, leading to the dismissal.
*   **Lack of Procedural Safeguards:** Galvez's failure to consult with the presiding judge or seek verification from authorized persons highlights the lack of internal controls and risks associated with independent actions.
*   **Reliance on External Assurance:** Galvez's reliance on the assurances of a non-court employee (Chavez) is a significant risk, emphasizing the need for independent verification and adherence to official procedures.
