**Case:** *Heirs of Maura So vs. Lucila Jomoc Obliosca, et al.*, G.R. No. 147082, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 397)

**Summary:** This case involves conflicting final and executory judgments regarding ownership of a parcel of land originally owned by Pantaleon Jomoc. The Jomoc heirs, including respondents, initially executed a Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement with Absolute Sale in favor of Maura So (predecessor of petitioners).  Later, they executed another similar deed in favor of the Lim spouses.  This resulted in litigation.

**Key Provisions & History:**

*   **1979 & 1983 Deeds:** Two Extrajudicial Settlements with Absolute Sale were executed, first to Maura So, and second to the Lim Spouses
*   **G.R. Nos. 92871 & 92860 (August 2, 1991):** SC upheld Maura So's better right to the property based on the first deed. The sale of the *whole* property to So was validated. Decision final and executory. (Vda. De Jomoc v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 92871, August 2, 1991, 200 SCRA 74)
*   **G.R. No. 110661 (December 1, 1993):** SC affirmed execution of the judgment in favor of So, *including against respondents* even though they weren't original party-defendants. The Court used res judicata principles.
*   **Civil Case No. 92-135 (RTC Redemption Case):** Respondents filed for legal redemption, claiming they didn't sell their shares and remained co-owners. RTC initially granted redemption, then reversed itself, then reinstated the grant.
*   **G.R. No. 118050 (March 1, 1995):**  So's petition for review of the RTC's redemption ruling was *denied by minute resolution*, citing failure to show grave abuse of discretion and wrong remedy. This became final.
*   **Petition for Annulment of Judgment (CA):** Petitioners sought to annul the RTC's redemption order. CA denied, stating the remedy was unavailable because So already filed a petition for review.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the RTC had jurisdiction in Civil Case No. 92-135 (redemption case) considering prior SC rulings affirming the sale to So.
2.  Whether the CA erred in holding the petition for annulment was barred by res judicata, given the SC resolution in G.R. No. 118050 was not "on the merits."

**Court's Holding & Rationale:**

*   Petition GRANTED despite procedural barriers.
*   The Court acknowledges the finality of judgments but invokes "higher interests of justice and equity" to set aside procedural norms.
*   **Conflicting Judgments:** The Court acknowledges three final judgments, G.R. 92871 & 92860, G.R. 110661, and G.R. 118050.
*   The Court prioritizes the earlier judgments (G.R. 92871/92860 and G.R. 110661) which held the whole property was sold to So.  G.R. 118050 was a minute resolution and not considered a full adjudication on the merits.
*   **Conclusiveness of Judgment:** The RTC's decision in the redemption case contradicted the SC's prior findings and was barred by the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment.  (Ybañez v. Court of Appeals, 323 Phil. 643, 655 (1996).
*   **Circumvention:** The Court found the legal redemption case was a deliberate attempt to circumvent prior SC decisions.
*   The Court is willing to rectify errors of judgment even if it means setting aside a final judgement.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Respondents (Jomoc Heirs) are divested of any right to redeem the property. They have an obligation to respect the ownership of the Heirs of Maura So.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Departure from Stare Decisis/Finality of Judgments:** While the court reached an equitable outcome, it did so by essentially disregarding a final judgment (G.R. No. 118050). This weakens the principles of *stare decisis* and the finality of judgments, potentially opening the door to challenges of other final decisions under similar, albeit compelling, circumstances.
*   **Limited Precedential Value:** The court emphasizes the "peculiar circumstances" of the case, suggesting this ruling may be limited to its specific facts.
*   **Lack of Extrinsic Fraud or Lack of Jurisdiction:** The Court notes that none of the grounds for annulment of judgment is present, but it uses its inherent power to suspend the rules.
*   **Reliance on Equity:** The decision relies heavily on equitable considerations.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari).
*   **Res Judicata:** Specifically, the principle of conclusiveness of judgment. (Ybañez v. Court of Appeals, 323 Phil. 643, 655 (1996))
*   **Finality of Judgments:** (Silliman University v. Fontelo-Paalan, G.R. No. 170948, June 26, 2007)
*   **Doctrine of Conclusiveness of Judgment:** (Ybañez v. Court of Appeals, 323 Phil. 643, 655 (1996))
*   **Exceptions to Finality:** Correction of clerical errors, nunc pro tunc entries, void judgments, and subsequent events making execution unjust.
*   **Inherent Power of the Court:** Power to amend or reconsider a final judgment to accomplish the ends of justice.

**For Legal Professionals:** This case highlights the tension between procedural rules and equitable outcomes. While the Court ultimately sided with the petitioners, the reliance on equitable principles and the implicit disregard of a prior final judgment create potential risks. The reasoning is based on the specific facts and the procedural history, making it of limited use in other cases that do not share those same complexities. Future litigants may cite this case to argue for equitable relief from final judgments, but success will likely depend on demonstrating equally compelling circumstances.
