**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Adelado Anguac y Ragadao*, G.R. No. 176744 (June 5, 2009)

**Summary:** This is an appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which modified and affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Adelado Anguac for rape (Revised Penal Code) and violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). Anguac was the common-law spouse of the victim's mother and had repeatedly raped the 17-year-old victim, AAA, while threatening her with a knife.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rape (Crim. Case No. RTC-2756-I):** Anguac was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of rape under the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Violation of RA 7610 Sec. 5(b) (Crim. Case No. RTC-2757-I):** The CA modified the RTC's finding and convicted Anguac under Sec. 5(b) instead of 5(a) of RA 7610, emphasizing that the actual facts alleged in the Information determine the nature of the crime, not the designation. Sec. 5(b) pertains to committing sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103):** Applied in sentencing for the RA 7610 violation, setting both a minimum and maximum prison term.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Reclusion Perpetua (Rape):**  Single indivisible penalty.
*   **Reclusion Temporal (RA 7610):** The maximum term of which shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same".
*   **Civil Indemnity (Rape):**  PhP 75,000.
*   **Moral Damages (Rape):** PhP 75,000.
*   **Exemplary Damages (Rape):** PhP 30,000.
*   **Moral Damages (RA 7610):**  PhP 50,000.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Anguac challenged the credibility of the victim, claiming ill motive. The SC, however, upheld the lower courts' assessment of the victim's credibility, emphasizing that any resentment would not prove any ill motive on AAA's part to falsely accuse Anguac of rape or necessarily detract from her credibility as a witness.
*   **Designation vs. Factual Allegations:** The case highlights the importance of carefully drafting informations to accurately reflect the crime committed. The initial error by the RTC in designating the crime demonstrates the risk of misinterpreting the applicable statute. *Garcia v. People, G.R. No. 144785, September 11, 2003, 410 SCRA 582, 587.*
*   **Denial vs. Positive Testimony:** The SC reiterated that a mere denial is insufficient to overcome the positive and straightforward testimony of the victim.
*   **Impact of RA 7610:** The application of RA 7610 showcases the enhanced protection afforded to children against sexual abuse and exploitation.
