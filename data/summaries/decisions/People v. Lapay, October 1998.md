## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lapay, G.R. No. 123072

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (358 Phil. 541)

**Case Summary:** Appeal of Cadiz Lapay from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for three counts of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC found Lapay guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on eyewitness testimonies and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua for each count. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the RTC decision with modifications to the civil indemnity awarded.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction for Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code):** Lapay found guilty of killing Nelson Dumasis, Rosario Sellado, and Juan Sellado with treachery.
*   **Treachery as Qualifying Circumstance:** The SC agreed with the RTC that treachery was present, as the victims were unarmed and the attack was sudden and unexpected.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The conviction heavily relies on the testimonies of Cornelio Valencia and Catalina Barrun, who positively identified Lapay and his brother Mario as the shooters.
*   **Denial and Alibi Rejected:** Lapay's defenses of denial and alibi were found weak and insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** Initially set at P30,000 per victim by the RTC, the SC increased this to P50,000 per victim, for a total of P150,000.

**Obligations:**

*   **Cadiz Lapay:** Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of murder, suffer accessory penalties, pay the costs, and pay civil indemnity of P50,000 to the heirs of each victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Lapay is criminally liable for the murder of the three victims.
*   **Civil Liability:** Lapay is civilly liable to the heirs of each victim for the damages suffered as a result of the murders.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Eyewitnesses:**  Lapay challenged the credibility of witnesses, claiming Valencia initially failed to identify the assailants. The SC dismissed this, citing People v. Malimit, stating delay due to fear is reasonable.
*   **Appellant's Physical Condition:** Lapay argued that his swollen hand made it physically impossible to fire a carbine. The Court rejected this due to lack of conclusive evidence and positive identification by witnesses.
*   **Inadmissibility of Counter-Affidavit:** The defense attempted to introduce the counter-affidavit of a deceased witness, but the SC upheld its inadmissibility due to the hearsay rule.
* **Generic Aggravating Circumstances:** Court disagreed with trial court that the generic aggravating circumstances, abuse of superior strength and aid of armed men, attended the killing.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Malimit (264 SCRA 167):** Addressed the issue of delayed identification of perpetrators, stating that fear is a valid reason for initial non-disclosure.
*   **People v. Beduya (182 SCRA 57):** Further supports the concept that fear of a witness explains the delayed notification of the authorities of a crime.
*   **People v. Paragua, People v. Arcilla, People v. Talaboc, People v. Faigano, People v. Villaviray, People v. Narciso, People v. Salazar, People v. Sandoval, People v. Buemio, People v. Layno, People v. Bawar, People v. Excija, People v. Rosare, People v. Nazareno, People v. Guarin, People v. Gecomo, People v. Garcia, People v. Alimon, People v. Laurente, People v. Prado, People v.

Marollano, People v. Cayabyab:** These cases outline the principles of witness credibility, burden of proof, and alibi.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes the crime of murder.

**Overall Assessment:**

The document represents a strong conviction based on credible eyewitness testimony. The SC applied established legal principles related to witness credibility, defenses, and qualifying circumstances. Potential challenges to the conviction were successfully addressed by the prosecution. The increased civil indemnity reflects current jurisprudential trends.
