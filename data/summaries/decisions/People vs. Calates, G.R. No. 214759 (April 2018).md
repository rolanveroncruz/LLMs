## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Calates*, G.R. No. 214759

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of dangerous drugs. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted the accused.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Core Issue:** Whether the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, specifically regarding the integrity and chain of custody of the seized drug (corpus delicti).
*   **SC Ruling:**  The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody due to significant lapses in compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165. The Court held that non-compliance with mandatory procedures concerning chain of custody casts doubt on the integrity of evidence, and is grounds for acquittal if there is no justification given by the arresting officers for not following procedure.
*   **Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and Implementing Rules:** Critical emphasis on the requirements of immediate inventory and photographing of seized drugs in the presence of the accused (or representative), an elected public official, and representatives from the media and the National Prosecution Service.
*   **Lack of Justification for Non-Compliance:** Prosecution failed to offer any credible justification for the arresting team's failure to comply with inventory and photograph requirements. The court cannot presume that justification exists. *Cf.* *People v. Pagaduan*, G.R. No. 179029.
*   **Marking:** PO1 Sonido marked the confiscated drug at the place of arrest but not in the presence of Dina. The unilateral marking engendered doubt about the integrity of the evidence presented during the trial.
*   **Chain of Custody Definition:** Defined as the "duly recorded authorized movement and custody of seized drugs… from the time of seizure… to the time of receipt in the forensic laboratory, to the safekeeping until presentation in court as evidence and for the purpose of destruction."
*   **Burden of Proof:** The State has the burden of proving both the elements of the crime *and* the integrity of the corpus delicti. The accused has no burden to prove her innocence.
*   **Reasonable Doubt Standard:** Defined, citing *United States v. Youthsey*. Guilt must be established to a degree that would lead one to act on it in the most important affairs of life.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement Obligation:** Strict adherence to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rules to preserve the chain of custody and integrity of evidence. Documented chain of custody that accounts for the identity and signature of the person or persons who held temporary custody thereof, the date and time when such transfer or custody was made in the course of safekeeping until presented in court as evidence, and the eventual disposition.
*   **Prosecution Obligation:** Prove the elements of the crime *and* the chain of custody beyond a reasonable doubt. Must justify any deviations from standard procedure under Section 21.
*   **Potential Liability:** Failure to adhere to these obligations can result in acquittal of the accused and potential administrative or criminal liabilities for law enforcement officers.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Acquittal Due to Chain of Custody Issues:**  The most significant risk is the dismissal of drug-related charges if the chain of custody is not properly established and documented. *See People v. Zakaria, G.R. No. 181042*.
*   **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine:** If the initial seizure is illegal due to non-compliance with Section 21, any subsequent evidence obtained might be inadmissible under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.
*   **Erosion of Public Trust:** Failure to follow proper procedures can undermine public trust in law enforcement and the justice system.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 5 & Section 21:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
*   **People v. Pagaduan, G.R. No. 179029:**  Cited regarding the necessity for explaining deviations from standard procedures.

*   **United States v. Youthsey, 91 Fed. Rep. 864:**  Cited regarding the definition of "reasonable doubt."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving clause" in Section 21 regarding non-compliance "under justifiable grounds" is consistently interpreted narrowly. The prosecution *must* affirmatively demonstrate and prove the existence of those justifiable grounds. The court cannot simply presume their existence. The justifiable ground for noncompliance must be proven as a fact.
