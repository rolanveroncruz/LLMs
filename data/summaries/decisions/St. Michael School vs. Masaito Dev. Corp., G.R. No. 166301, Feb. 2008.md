**Case Summary: St. Michael School of Cavite, Inc. v. Masaito Development Corporation**

**Citation:** 570 Phil. 574 (G.R. No. 166301, February 29, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Sufficiency of cause of action for a complaint for easement of right-of-way under Article 649 of the Civil Code.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** St. Michael School of Cavite, Inc. (represented by Gloria M. Claveria) and Spouses Crisanto S. Claveria and Gloria M. Claveria
*   **Respondents:** Masaito Development Corporation and Rexlon Realty Group, Inc.

**Facts:**

*   St. Michael School is located adjacent to Citihomes subdivision owned by Respondents. The school's sole access/exit point uses a portion of Lot 4, Block 7 of Citihomes (61 sq. m.).
*   Respondents offered to sell portions of Citihomes to Petitioners, which Petitioners declined, deeming them overpriced or unnecessary.
*   Petitioners filed a complaint for easement of right-of-way with damages and injunctive relief.
*   The trial court initially issued a TRO, then dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action and lack of real party in interest.
*   The Court of Appeals dismissed the subsequent petition for certiorari based on procedural defects in the verification and certification of non-forum shopping.

**Key Provisions/Legal Arguments:**

*   **Easement of Right-of-Way (Art. 649, Civil Code):**  Requires (1) dominant estate surrounded by other immovables with no adequate outlet to a public highway; (2) payment of proper indemnity; and (3) isolation not due to the proprietor's own acts.
*   **Cause of Action:**  A complaint must allege (1) the legal right of the plaintiff; (2) the correlative obligation of the defendant; and (3) the act or omission of the defendant violating said legal right. *Dabuco v. Court of Appeals* requires the *sufficiency,* not the *veracity,* of material allegations at the motion to dismiss stage.
*   **Verification & Certification of Non-Forum Shopping (Rule 7, Sec. 4, Rules of Court):**  Affidavit stating allegations are true and correct from personal knowledge *or* based on authentic records.
*   **Real Party-in-Interest:**  The claimant in an action for easement of right-of-way must be the owner of the dominant estate or have a real right to cultivate or use the immovable surrounded by other immovables (Art. 649).

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the petition based on technicality.  The submission of a Special Power of Attorney and Secretary's Certificate by Gloria M. Claveria constituted substantial compliance with the verification requirements. The court cited *Valdecantos v. People* to justify relaxation of procedural rules based on justifiable circumstances and substantial compliance.
*   The trial court erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action.  The complaint, when considered in its entirety, including annexed documents (location plan, photographs), sufficiently alleges the elements of an easement of right-of-way under Art. 649. Allegations regarding the school's lack of adequate access to a public highway and willingness to pay indemnity, coupled with supporting documents, satisfy the pleading requirements.
*   The school is a real party-in-interest due to its established right to use the passageway for the benefit of its students, especially since the owners of the lot where the school is located, the spouses Claveria, are incorporators, trustees, and officers of the school and are also co-petitioners.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Respondents have a potential obligation to grant an easement of right-of-way if Petitioners can prove the elements under Art. 649 and pay proper indemnity.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Adequacy of Outlet:** The existence and nature of the major "access road" are contentious.  The Court interpreted the pleadings and annexes in favor of the Petitioners, but further factual development at trial may challenge this finding.
*   **Proper Indemnity:**  The amount of indemnity to be paid by Petitioners for the easement is not yet determined and could be a source of further dispute.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 649:** Easement of Right-of-Way
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Sec. 4:** Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping
*    *Dabuco v. Court of Appeals,* - Dismissal for failure to state a cause of action
*   *Valdecantos v. People*, - Relaxation of procedural rules based on justifiable circumstances and substantial compliance.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that the Petitioners had substantially complied with procedural requirements and sufficiently stated a cause of action for an easement of right-of-way. The case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The Court emphasized that at the motion to dismiss stage, the *sufficiency* of the allegations, rather than their *veracity*, is the determinative factor, and that the complaint should be construed liberally, considering all attached documents. This ruling underscores the importance of a holistic review of pleadings and the permissibility of substantial compliance with procedural rules in the interest of justice.
