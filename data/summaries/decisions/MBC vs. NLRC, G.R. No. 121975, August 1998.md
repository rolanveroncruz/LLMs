## Legal Document Summary: Manila Broadcasting Company vs. NLRC and Samuel L. Bangloy

**Case:** G.R. No. 121975, August 20, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the NLRC decision affirming illegal dismissal of private respondent Samuel Bangloy.

**Key Issue:** Validity of Manila Broadcasting Company's (MBC) unwritten policy considering employees who file certificates of candidacy for public office as resigned, and the legality of Bangloy's dismissal for running for office and exceeding approved leave.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MBC's Unwritten Policy:** MBC had an unwritten policy that employees running for public office were considered resigned.
*   **Employee Leave:** Bangloy applied for 50 days of leave to run for office, pursuant to R.A. 6646 §11(b).
*   **Reinstatement Order:**  Labor Arbiter ordered reinstatement with backwages and damages. NLRC affirmed reinstatement and backwages but deleted damages.
*   **R.A. 6646 §11(b):**  Requires mass media personnel running for office to take a leave of absence during the campaign period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MBC Liability:** The Supreme Court upheld the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal, but modified the backwages award. MBC was liable to reinstate Bangloy and pay backwages from June 24, 1992 (after a one-month suspension) until actual reinstatement.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Written Policy:** The core issue is the enforceability of MBC's unwritten policy. The Court emphasizes the need for written and published rules. This creates a risk that the policy lacked proper notice and consent.
*   **Inconsistent Enforcement:** Apparent inconsistencies in enforcing the policy, plus assurances from the station manager, created a reliance issue.
*   **AWOL Argument:** MBC argued Bangloy was AWOL for exceeding authorized leave by 11 days. The Court deemed dismissal too harsh, considering his prior service and this was his first offense.
*   **Management Prerogative vs. Employee Rights:**  The case balances MBC's right to manage its business (policy on political candidacies) against Bangloy's right to security of tenure.
*   **Good Faith Reliance**:  The Court's conclusion that Bangloy relied in good faith on the manager's assurances creates risk/uncertainty for similar policies.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6646 §11(b):** Pertains to the leave of absence for mass media personnel during the campaign period.
*   **Labor Code Art. 282(a):** Employer's right to dismiss due to willful disobedience (cited by MBC; ultimately unpersuasive).
*   **Local Government Code §90(b):** Permits Sanggunian members to engage in other occupations, cited by Bangloy but found not to preclude a stricter company policy.
*   **Omnibus Election Code §3, as amended by R.A. No. 7166 §5:** States the campaign period for local elective positions is forty-five (45) days.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **_BLTC Co. v. Court of Appeals_ (71 SCRA 471 (1976)); _Mañebo v. NLRC_ (229 SCRA 240 (1994)); _Nuez v. NLRC_ (239 SCRA 518 (1994)); _AHS/Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals_ (257 SCRA 319 (1996)).** Cites the requirements for dismissal based on willful disobedience.
*   **_Dolores v. NLRC_ (205 SCRA 348 (1992)):**  Cited to demonstrate that dismissal is too harsh of a penalty for a relatively short unauthorized leave, especially considering the employee's length of service.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the lack of a written policy and inconsistent communication/enforcement, leaving room for reasonable interpretation by Bangloy.
*   The extent to which an employer can restrict an employee's political activities, even absent a statutory prohibition, remains a potential area for debate.

**Conclusion:**

The court sided with the employee due to the lack of a clear, written, and communicated policy, combined with factors suggesting implied approval of the leave and good-faith reliance on the manager's statements. This case reinforces the importance of clearly defined and disseminated company policies, especially those impacting fundamental employee rights.
