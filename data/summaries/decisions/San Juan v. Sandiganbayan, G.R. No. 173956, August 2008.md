**Case Summary: *Frisco F. San Juan v. Sandiganbayan and People*, G.R. No. 173956**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan Resolutions granting the prosecution's motion for additional marking of documentary exhibits in a criminal case for violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Frisco F. San Juan (Chairman of PEA)
*   Respondents: Sandiganbayan and People of the Philippines

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 â€“ allegedly giving unwarranted benefits, advantage, and preference to J.D. Legaspi Construction in connection with the President Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard Project, resulting in undue injury to the government. Conspiracy among PEA officials, COA officials, and the contractor is alleged. Specific acts include illegal bidding process, awarding of contract without fund availability, approving improper change orders, and allowing/paying improper claims to Legaspi, resulting in an overprice.
*   **Procedural Issue:** Prosecution's Manifestation with Motion for Additional Marking of Documentary Exhibits, filed *after* pre-trial, but *before* the Pre-Trial Order was formally signed, was granted by Sandiganbayan.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   San Juan, as Chairman of PEA, faces potential criminal liability under RA 3019 if found to have participated in the alleged conspiracy and acts leading to unwarranted benefits for Legaspi.
*   Other accused officials (PEA Board members, officers, COA officials) share potential liability based on their respective roles.
*   Legaspi, the private contractor, faces potential liability as a co-conspirator.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction under RA 3019:** Could result in imprisonment, fines, and disqualification from public office if evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt San Juan's involvement in acts constituting a violation.
*   **Financial Liability:** Potential for civil liability to recover the allegedly overpaid amount (P532,926,420.39).
*   **Prolonged Litigation:** The case involves numerous defendants and complex transactions, likely leading to a lengthy trial.
*   **Evidentiary Challenges:** Prosecution needs to establish conspiracy, manifest partiality/evident bad faith/gross inexcusable negligence, and a direct causal link between San Juan's actions and the undue injury to the government.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Sec. 3(e):** Prohibits public officials from causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Rule 15, Sec. 4 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the hearing of motions and requires a three-day notice rule, unless the court sets a hearing on shorter notice for good cause.  *People v. Leviste, G.R. No. 104386, March 28, 1996, 255 SCRA 238, 247* and *Active Realty and Development Corporation v. Fernandez, G.R. No. 157186, October 19, 2007, 537 SCRA 116, 130* cited regarding liberal application of procedural rules where a rigid application would result in miscarriage of justice.
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC:** Guidelines on the conduct of the pre-trial

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Granting Additional Exhibits after Pre-Trial:**  The Sandiganbayan's decision to allow additional exhibits *after* the formal pre-trial but *before* the Pre-Trial order was signed is the central point of contention.  The defense argues this violates due process.
*   **"Good Cause" for Shortened Notice:**  Whether the prosecution's justification (volume of documents, recently completed supporting documents) constitutes "good cause" to waive the three-day notice rule is debatable.
*   **Reservations in Pre-Trial:** The fact that both parties reserved the right to present additional evidence during trial weakens the argument about "surprise evidence," but doesn't entirely negate potential prejudice.
*   **"Manifest Injustice" Standard:**  Sandiganbayan invoking its power to modify Pre-Trial Order to "prevent manifest injustice" requires careful scrutiny to ensure it's applied fairly and doesn't unduly prejudice the defense.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Focus on Due Process:** Continue to argue that the late introduction of exhibits prejudiced the defense's ability to adequately prepare. Argue that the "good cause" cited by the prosecution was insufficient.
*   **Challenge Admissibility:** Vigorously object to the admissibility of each newly introduced exhibit on grounds of relevance, authenticity, and prejudice.
*   **Demonstrate Prejudice:** Show specifically how the inability to review the documents earlier hampered the preparation of the defense.
*   **Scrutinize Factual Basis:** Thoroughly examine the factual basis for the allegations of conspiracy, manifest partiality, and undue injury. Demonstrate lack of evidence.
*   **Consider a Motion for Bill of Particulars:** If the information is overly broad or lacks specificity, file a motion to compel the prosecution to provide more detail.
