## Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Decena, et al.* (G.R. No. 212786)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmation of the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) determination of just compensation in an expropriation case.

**Facts:** The Republic, through the DPWH, initiated expropriation proceedings against Respondents' properties for the C5 Road Extension project after failed negotiated sales. The DPWH deposited an amount equivalent to 100% of the zonal valuation with Land Bank, obtained a writ of possession, and the RTC issued an Order of Condemnation. The RTC-appointed Board of Commissioners (BOC) recommended a just compensation of P17,893.33 per square meter. Respondents presented a valuation from Philippine Appraisal Company, Inc. (PACI) suggesting P30,000.00 per square meter. The RTC ultimately fixed just compensation at P25,000.00 per square meter, which the CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Expropriation Power:** The Republic asserts its right to expropriate private property for public use, subject to payment of just compensation (Art. III, Sec. 9, 1987 Constitution).
*   **R.A. 8974 (now R.A. 10752):** This law governs the expropriation process, specifically Section 5 outlines factors for assessing the value of land subject to expropriation. Requires payment of 100% zonal value upon filing.
*   **Just Compensation:** The central issue revolves around the determination of "just compensation," defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property, to be ascertained as of the *date of taking or the filing of the complaint, whichever comes first* (Sec. 4, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
*   **Obligation to Pay Interest:** Legal interest is due on any unpaid portion of the just compensation from the date of taking until full payment. The interest rates fluctuate based on the period (12% per annum, then 6% per annum per BSP Circular 799).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Republic/DPWH:** Liable to pay Respondents (1) the unpaid portion of the fair market value (FMV) determined by the court (P25,000.00/sqm less the initial deposit); (2) interest on the unpaid portion from the filing date of the expropriation complaints; and (3) interest on the FMV from the filing date to the date of initial deposit.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** Discrepancies existed between the valuations offered by BOC, PACI, and the RTC. The Court emphasized the RTC's discretion in weighing these factors.
*   **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** The legal interest rate changes depending on the period, necessitating precise calculation. *Eastern Shipping Lines Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al*
*   **Date of Taking:** The date of the "taking" is critical for calculating interest, and in this case is the date of filing the complaint since the filing of the complaints preceded the taking of possession of the property. Sec. 4, Rule 67, Rules of Court dictates FMV should be that of the time of taking, or filing of the complaint, whichever came first.
*   **Definition of Just Compensation:** The case reinforces that the initial deposit based on zonal valuation is *not* equivalent to just compensation. Final just compensation is determined judicially.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. III, Sec. 9, 1987 Constitution:** Guarantee of just compensation.
*   **R.A. 8974 (now R.A. 10752):** Standards for expropriation; Section 5 sets forth the parameters in determining the fair market value of the real property.
*   **Rule 67, Sec. 4 & 10, Rules of Court:** Procedural rules for expropriation. Sec. 4 deals with the FMV of the property in relation to date of taking vs. date of filing of complaint. Sec. 10 outlines rights of plaintiff after payment of just compensation.
*   ***LECA Realty Corporation v. Republic* (534 Phil. 693):** CA cited this case in finding appraisals based on newspaper advertisements for sale are merely asking price and subject to further negotiation.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (304 Phil. 236):** Used as reference for calculation of legal interest.
*   ***B.H. Berkenkotter & Co. v. Court of Appeals* (290-A Phil. 371):** Discussed the "date of taking"
*   ***Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic*** Case used in Court's justification to the application of interest in eminent domain cases.
*  ***Republic of the Phils. v. Judge Mupas*** Case used to justify the concept of compliance with eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness
*   **BSP Circular No. 799 (s. 2013):** Sets the legal interest rate at 6% per annum (from July 1, 2013 onwards).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding the RTC's valuation of P25,000.00 per square meter. While the Petition was ultimately denied, the Court clarified the Republic's liability to pay interest on the unpaid portion of the just compensation and outlined the methodology for calculating such interest. The RTC is ordered to compute the specific amounts due to each respondent based on the filing dates of their respective expropriation complaints. The Republic's focus should now be on calculating the precise amounts owed, including the changing interest rates, and ensuring prompt payment to avoid further accrual of interest.
