**Case Summary: Gomez v. Gatdula, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1155 (July 31, 1998)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Judge Rodolfo A. Gatdula of the MTC, Balanga, Bataan, arising from letter-complaints filed by Dolores Gomez.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 5988 (Reckless Imprudence):** Judge Gatdula allegedly attempted to dissuade complainant from pursuing the case, offered to reduce claim, refused to issue warrant of arrest initially, and delayed amendment of the complaint. Allegation of witness intimidation orchestrated through the judge's inaction.
*   **Criminal Case No. 5917 (Falsification):** Complainant's request for transfer of venue led to the judge cancelling hearings in *both* cases and delaying filing of his comment on the request, effectively stalling proceedings in both cases.
*   **Overall Allegation:** Gross incompetence, grave abuse of authority, acts unbecoming a member of the judiciary, oppression, and deliberate delay of proceedings.

**Judge's Defense:**

*   Denied attempting to dissuade complainant or reduce the claim.
*   Blamed the investigating officer (policeman) for the initial flawed complaint in Criminal Case No. 5988.
*   Claimed delay in filing comment was due to seeking to transfer both cases, and not to stall.
*   Alleged complainant filed case because he did not help her secure the damages she wanted.

**Court's Findings & Rationale:**

*   **Guilty of Oppression and Acts Unbecoming a Judge:** The Court found Judge Gatdula acted in a "vindictive and oppressive manner" by suspending proceedings in both cases and delaying filing of comment. This was tied to the complainant's request for transfer of venue.
*   **Impropriety and Appearance Thereof:** His behavior "is not free from the appearance of impropriety, let alone beyond reproach, as required by Canon 3 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics." This Canon requires judges to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. *Reference:* Caamic v. Galapon, Jr., 237 SCRA 390 (1994).
*   **No Fault Found on Reckless Imprudence Charge:** The court did *not* find Judge Gatdula responsible for the initial error in the charge in Criminal Case No. 5988, as preparation of the complaint falls upon the investigating officer. The court stated that under Rule 112, ยง6(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the judge of the MTC can order the arrest of the respondent only if, after preliminary investigation, he is satisfied that probable cause exists and there is necessity of placing respondent under immediate arrest in order not to frustrate the ends of justice.
*  **Other Pending Cases:** Discovery of other cases pending beyond the reglementary period triggered a separate investigation (referred to *en banc*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Fine:** P10,000.00
*   **Warning:** Repetition of similar offense will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Appearance of Impropriety":** The application of Canon 3 can be subjective. Gatdula could argue his actions were not intended to be vindictive, but rather were based on procedural grounds (even if those grounds were, ultimately, improperly applied).
*   **Impact on Other Cases:** The finding of oppression and acts unbecoming a judge could be used to challenge decisions made by Judge Gatdula in other cases, raising questions of impartiality.
*   **Collateral Investigation:** Separate investigation into other delayed cases could lead to further disciplinary action.
* **Witness Intimidation:** Key witnesses of Criminal Case 5988 not being included in the witness list.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 112, ยง6(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Concerns the authority of an MTC judge to order an arrest *after* preliminary investigation.
*   **Canon 3 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics:** Standard of conduct requiring judges to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.

**Case Law:**

*   **Caamic v. Galapon, Jr., 237 SCRA 390 (1994):** Cited as precedent for the standard of conduct expected of judges under Canon 3.
