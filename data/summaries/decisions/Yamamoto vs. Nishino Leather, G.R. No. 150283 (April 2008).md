**Case Summary: *Ryuichi Yamamoto v. Nishino Leather Industries, Inc. and Ikuo Nishino* (G.R. No. 150283, April 16, 2008)**

**Facts:**

*   Yamamoto (Japanese national) and Nishino (Japanese national) formed Wako Enterprises Manila, Inc. (now NLII).
*   Dispute arose over ownership of machineries/equipment Yamamoto contributed as part of his capital investment when Nishino planned to takeover NLII
*   Yamamoto filed a replevin suit after attempting to recover machinery/equipment based on a letter from Nishino's counsel, Atty. Doce, indicating he could do so, with deduction from his capital contribution.
*   NLII argued the machinery formed part of capital contribution and the lawyer's letter was just a conditional offer.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Replevin Action:** Yamamoto sought to recover machinery/equipment.
*   **Corporate Ownership:** NLII claimed the machinery/equipment was corporate property, not Yamamoto's.
*   **Atty. Doce's Letter:** Yamamoto relied on the letter allowing him to retrieve the equipment.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Yamamoto argued that the corporation was merely an instrumentality of Ikuo and Yoshinobu Nishino, justifying disregarding the corporate fiction.
*   **Promissory Estoppel:** Yamamoto claimed the respondents should be estopped from denying his right to retrieve the equipment after representing he could.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **Denied Replevin**: The Supreme Court reversed the CA and RTC, denying Yamamoto's petition and upholding the corporate ownership of the machinery.
*   **No Authority to Bind Corporation**: SC held that the lawyer's letter could not bind the corporation, absent a Board Resolution authorizing Nishino to act on behalf of the corporation. Cites Section 23 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Rejection of Piercing the Corporate Veil**: The court refused to pierce the corporate veil, finding no evidence that Nishino used the corporate entity to commit fraud or injustice against Yamamoto, referencing *PNB v. Ritratto Group, Inc.* and *Concept Builders, Inc. v. NLRC.*. Key elements for piercing were not met including control used to commit fraud and proximately caused injury.
*   **No Promissory Estoppel**: The court rejected the promissory estoppel claim because the letter was deemed a mere offer, not a promise, and Yamamoto did not prove acceptance of the condition (deduction from capital contribution). Cites Article 1181 of the Civil Code.
*   **Trust Fund Doctrine:** The court invoked the trust fund doctrine, stating that corporate assets are held in trust for creditors, prioritizing them over stockholders in asset distribution. Cites *Boman Environmental Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals*.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Yamamoto was obligated to accept the condition attached to the offer for return of the machineries.
*   NLII, as a corporation, has an obligation to protect the trust fund of its assets for creditors.
* Corporations can only be bound through the appropriate authority (ie, Board Resolution).

**Liabilities:**

*   Yamamoto is liable for the costs of suit.
*   NLII is not liable for attorney's fees (as the appellate court reversed the RTC's award).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Lack of Board Resolution:** The absence of a formal Board Resolution approving the agreement to allow Yamamoto to retrieve the machinery proved fatal to his claim. This highlights the importance of proper corporate governance and documentation.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Yamamoto failed to convincingly demonstrate fraud or wrongdoing by Nishino related to the use of the corporate entity, which is essential for piercing the corporate veil.
*   **Conditional Offer vs. Promise:** The ambiguous language in Atty. Doce's letter was construed as a conditional offer rather than an unequivocal promise.
*   **Promissory Estoppel application**: There was a lack of clarity in the offer regarding whether it was an offer to buy out the shares rather than a promise.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 23:** Corporate powers are exercised by the Board of Directors.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1181:** Conditional obligations.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 1318 & 1319:** Consent must be present for a contract. Offer must be certain and acceptance absolute.
*   ***PNB v. Ritratto Group, Inc.*:** Discusses piercing the corporate veil.
*   ***Concept Builders, Inc. v. NLRC***: The Court held that elements determinative of the applicability of the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction.
*   ***Boman Environmental Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals***: Discusses the trust fund doctrine.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The language in Atty. Doce's letter regarding the machinery: "Regarding the above machines, you may take them out with you (for your own use and sale) if you want, provided, the value of such machines is deducted from your and Wako's capital contributions, which will be paid to you." The ambiguity centered on whether this was a firm promise, a conditional offer, or a subject for further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the importance of clear contractual terms, proper corporate governance, and the burden of proof in establishing fraud when seeking to disregard the corporate veil. Yamamoto's failure to secure a binding corporate agreement and demonstrate reliance to his detriment resulted in the denial of his claim for replevin.
