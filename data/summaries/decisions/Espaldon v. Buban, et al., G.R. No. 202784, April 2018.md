## Legal Document Summary: *Espaldon v. Buban, et al.* (G.R. No. 202784)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus under Rule 65 seeking to nullify Ombudsman Orders dismissing a criminal complaint and compel the Ombudsman to take cognizance of the complaint.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Complaint:** Petitioner Jonnel Espaldon, as Corporate Secretary and counsel for several companies, filed a complaint-affidavit against NBI agents, PNR personnel, and private individuals involved in the implementation of search warrants against Ferrotech Steel Corp., Metalex International Inc., and Metal Exponents, Inc. alleging irregularities.
*   **Charges:** Violations of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, and Code of Professional Responsibility. Specifically Articles 129 and 286 of the RPC and Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
*   **Ombudsman's Dismissal:** The Ombudsman dismissed the criminal complaint (OMB-C-C-11-0034-A) based on Section 20(1) of R.A. No. 6770, citing that the complainant had an adequate remedy in another judicial or quasi-judicial body (Commissioner of Customs and/or the Department of Finance and/or the Court of Tax Appeals). The Ombudsman also dismissed the administrative complaint (OMB-C-A-11-0036-A) using the same grounds.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the Ombudsman's dismissal of the criminal complaint.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Ombudsman's Obligation:** The Supreme Court directed the Ombudsman to take cognizance of the criminal complaint and evaluate it in accordance with Section 2, Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman. This mandates an evaluation to determine if the complaint should be dismissed for lack of merit, referred for comment, endorsed to a proper government office, referred for fact-finding, referred for administrative adjudication, or subjected to a preliminary investigation.
*   **Potential Liabilities of Respondents:** The underlying complaint alleges violations of criminal laws and anti-graft legislation by the named respondents, which could lead to criminal prosecution and penalties if probable cause is established.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misapplication of R.A. No. 6770, Section 20(1):** The key issue is the Ombudsman's reliance on Section 20(1) of R.A. No. 6770, which the Supreme Court clarified is applicable only to *administrative* complaints, not *criminal* complaints.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Court found that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the criminal complaint based on grounds applicable only to administrative cases and deviating from its own procedural rules.
*   **Lack of Preliminary Investigation:** The Court noted that the dismissal occurred before a preliminary investigation was conducted, raising questions about the thoroughness of the Ombudsman's review.
*   **Judicial Review:** The case underscores the judiciary's power to review the Ombudsman's actions for grave abuse of discretion, despite the broad investigative and prosecutorial powers granted to the Ombudsman.
*   **Search Warrants and Authority:** Underlying the criminal complaint are allegations of irregularities in the implementation of search warrants issued under the authority of the Department of Finance. These actions may expose potential violations of the Penal Code, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and other violations alleged by the petition.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6770:** The Ombudsman Act, specifically Sections 19 and 20.
*   **Administrative Order No. 07:** Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman, particularly Rule II, Section 2 (procedure in criminal cases) and Rule III, Section 4 (procedure in administrative cases).
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 129 and 286 (alleged violations).
*   **R.A. No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Section 3(e) (alleged violation).
*   **Bueno, et al. v. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., 743 Phil. 313, 330 (2014):** Clarifies the discretionary nature of dismissal under Section 20 of R.A. No. 6770.
*  **Casing v. Hon. Ombudsman, et al., 687 Phil. 468 (2012):** Jurisprudence on dismissal based on grounds provided under Section 20.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman v. Court of Appeals, et al., 576 Phil. 784 (2008).**

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key contentious issue is the interpretation and application of Section 20(1) of R.A. No. 6770, which the Ombudsman improperly used to dismiss the criminal complaint.
*   The Ombudsman's stated reason for dismissal – the availability of another remedy – is contradicted by the Court's interpretation of the law and procedural rules.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court found that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in prematurely dismissing the criminal complaint based on a misapplication of the law. The case highlights the limitations on the Ombudsman's discretion and the importance of adhering to proper procedural rules in criminal investigations. The Ombudsman is now obligated to re-evaluate the complaint and proceed in accordance with its own rules of procedure.
