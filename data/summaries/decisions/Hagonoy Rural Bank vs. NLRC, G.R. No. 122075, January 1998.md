## Legal Document Summary: *Hagonoy Rural Bank, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 122075, January 28, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision affirming with modification the Labor Arbiter's ruling of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in upholding the Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal.
*   **Holding:** No. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition and affirmed the NLRC decision with a minor modification to the backwages computation for two employees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Hagonoy Rural Bank, Inc. (Petitioner):** Liable for back wages, 13th-month pay, and separation pay (or reinstatement) to the employees. Specific amounts are calculated based on duration of employment and salary. Ordered to reinstate illegally dismissed employees or pay separation pay.
*   **Employees (Respondents):** Obligation to accept reinstatement or separation pay as offered.

**Key Facts & Reasoning:**

*   Employees were initially placed on leave, allegedly voluntarily, during an audit due to suspected irregularities. The employees were given a pre-typed application for leave without pay for 30 days from October 16, 1992, which they signed. After its expiration, they were told to extend their leave for another 30 days and they were told that their extended leave was with pay.
*   Subsequent refusal to reinstate employees constituted constructive dismissal.
*   The Court rejected the bank's defense of abandonment, citing that filing a complaint for illegal dismissal is inconsistent with abandonment. Cited *Jones v. NLRC, 250 SCRA 668, 672-673 [1996]* and *Labor v. NLRC, supra note 14 at 198-199*.
*   The Court found that employees were essentially coerced into taking leave, undermining the claim of voluntary separation.
*   Employee Rodolfo Manalo's preventive suspension for alleged cash abstraction was deemed illegal due to lack of due process (no hearing). Cited *Ma√±ebo v. NLRC, 229 SCRA 240, 251 [1994]* and Article 277 (b) of the Labor Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   Back wages, 13th-month pay, and separation pay (or reinstatement) to the employees, which were to be determined on remand by the NLRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Compliance Costs:** The bank faces significant financial burden due to the back wages, 13th-month pay, and separation pay obligations.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A finding of illegal dismissal could damage the bank's reputation and employee morale.
*   **Further Litigation:** There is the potential for further disputes regarding the precise calculation of monetary awards.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Art. 277(b)):**  Cited regarding procedural due process in disciplinary actions and dismissal.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 65):** Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in certiorari petitions is limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Rules of Court (Section 5, Rule 133):** Substantial evidence is sufficient in administrative or quasi-judicial bodies.
*   **Civil Code (Art. 1146):** The prescriptive period for actions based on injury to rights is four years.
*   **Jurisprudence on Abandonment:** *City of Manila vs. Subido, 17 SCRA 231*, *Shin I Industrial (Phils.) vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 74489, August 3, 1988*. It requires both failure to report to work and a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship. Mere absence is insufficient.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The NLRC's reduction of damages due to "lack of sufficient evidence" might be contentious.
*   Daisy Reyes's unilateral withdrawal from the case raises questions about the validity and enforceability of her waiver of claims. The court noted that the counsel for the private respondents had yet to comment on this.

**Overall:** The court upheld the finding of illegal dismissal based on constructive dismissal (coerced leave) and lack of due process (for Manalo). The bank faces significant financial liabilities and reputational risks.
