**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Malou Alvarado y Flores, Alvin Alvarez y Lonquias, and Ramil Dal y Molianeda*, G.R. No. 234048, April 23, 2018.

**Summary:**

This case involves an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the Accused-Appellants for violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). Malou Alvarado was convicted for both illegal sale (Sec. 5) and illegal possession (Sec. 11) of *shabu*, while Alvin Alvarez and Ramil Dal were convicted for illegal sale (Sec. 5).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Charges:** Malou was charged with violating Section 11 (illegal possession) for possessing 0.04 grams of *shabu* and Section 5 (illegal sale) for selling 0.01 gram of *shabu*. Alvin and Ramil were charged with violating Section 5 (illegal sale) for selling 0.01 gram of *shabu*.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution presented evidence of a buy-bust operation where PO2 Burgos acted as a poseur buyer and purchased *shabu* from Ramil, who received it from Malou after Alvin received the marked money. Four additional sachets of *shabu* were allegedly recovered from Malou's possession.
*   **Accused's Defense:** The Accused-Appellants claimed frame-up and denial, alleging that police officers broke into their house without a warrant, planted evidence, and attempted to extort money.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC found the Accused-Appellants guilty, giving credence to the police officers' testimonies and finding substantial compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 due to the presence of a *barangay kagawad* during the inventory.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA affirmed the RTC's decision, holding that the prosecution proved the illegal sale and possession beyond a reasonable doubt and that there was compliance with the chain of custody rule. The CA cited *People v. Salvador* to justify the lack of strict compliance with Section 21.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision, acquitting all three Accused-Appellants.

**Key Legal Issues & Reasoning:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, a crucial element for proving *corpus delicti* in drug cases.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 Compliance:** The Court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (as it existed prior to the R.A. 10640 amendment), requiring the presence of the accused (or representative), a representative from the media, and a representative from the DOJ during the inventory and photographing of seized items. The Court cited *People v. Macud* and other cases emphasizing the necessity of these witnesses to prevent abuse.
*   **"Justifiable Grounds" for Non-Compliance:** While the IRR of R.A. No. 9165 allows for non-strict compliance if there are justifiable grounds, the Court found that the prosecution failed to provide any justifiable reason for the absence of the DOJ and media representatives. The arresting officer admitted he couldn't remember if his team leader contacted them.
*   **Preservation of Integrity and Evidentiary Value:** The Court highlighted lapses in the handling of the seized items, particularly the failure to properly seal and document the transfer of the *shabu* from the crime scene to the police station and the crime laboratory. The forensic chemist's testimony indicated that the seized items were not sealed in a container. The Court noted that the small amount of the drugs increased the risk of tampering.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court stated that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties cannot be invoked to overcome clear lapses in procedure and that the prosecution must affirmatively prove the integrity of the evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision is a strong affirmation of the importance of the procedural safeguards in R.A. No. 9165. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 21 can be fatal to the prosecution's case, even if there is evidence of the actual sale or possession of illegal drugs.
*   The decision emphasizes the need for the prosecution to provide *justifiable grounds* for any non-compliance with Section 21 and to document those grounds in sworn affidavits. This requires more than a mere assertion that compliance was difficult.
*   The Court's scrutiny of the chain of custody, from the point of seizure to the presentation in court, highlights the importance of meticulous record-keeping and proper handling of drug evidence. Any gaps in the chain can raise reasonable doubt about the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.
* The original Section 21 of RA 9165 was applied due to it being more favorable to the appellants.
* The decision raises concerns about the allocation of resources in drug enforcement, suggesting a need to focus on "big fish" rather than small-time users and retailers.
