## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Adela Sia and Robert Ngo, G.R. No. 165836

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision which (1) declared Adela Sia and Robert Ngo as co-owners of a property; (2) ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel TCT No. 195378 (Galicias) and reinstate TCT No. 164726 (Ngo & Sia); and (3) ordered the cancellation of annotations on TCT No. 164726.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Dispute over Property Ownership:** MIDCOM initially contracted to sell a property to the Galicias. MIDCOM then sold the same property to Apolonia Sia Ngo and Adela Sia.  Galicias sued MIDCOM and Ngos for Specific Performance (Civil Case No. 84-27347).
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. 84-27347):** RTC ruled in favor of the Galicias, ordering MIDCOM to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale to them, and declaring Apolonia Ngo's claim void. This included ordering all persons claiming right under Apolonia Ngo to convey the subject property to the Galicias
*   **Lis Pendens:** Galicias filed lis pendens on original title.
*   **TCT Issuance:** Despite a TRO, TCT No. 164726 was issued to Apolonia S. Ngo and Adela Sia. Later, TCT No. 195378 was issued to the Galicias after the decision in Civil Case No. 84-27347 became final.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Galicias mortgaged the property to PNB securing a loan.
*   **New Action (Civil Case No. 91-58130):** Ngos and Sia filed a new complaint for Quieting of Title, alleging that their title was beclouded by the decision in Civil Case No. 84-27347, and impleading PNB.
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed RTC's decision, favoring the Ngos and Sia, finding MIDCOM could rescind contract with Galicias because it was a mere contract to sell and finding PNB to be a Mortgagee in Bad Faith.

**Issues:**

1.  **Res Judicata:** Does the doctrine of res judicata bar Civil Case No. 91-58130?
2.  **Mortgagee in Bad Faith:** Is PNB a mortgagee in bad faith?

**Supreme Court Holding:**

1.  **Res Judicata Applies:** The Supreme Court held that res judicata *does* apply, specifically "conclusiveness of judgement." The issues of title and the validity of the judgment in Civil Case No. 84-27347 were already litigated and resolved with finality in prior cases (CA-G.R. SP No. 22889 and CA-G.R. SP No. 25819). Sia's argument that her non-inclusion in Civil Case No. 84-27347 rendered the judgement void was already rejected with finality in the past.
2.  **PNB is Mortgagee in Good Faith:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and held that PNB acted in good faith. The decision in Civil Case No. 84-27347 was final and executory when the Galicias applied for the loan. The Ngos submitted documents to the PNB that showed that the trial court had ordered the register of Deeds to cancel the title of Apolonia Sia.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Galicias:** Entitled to the property as per the original decision in Civil Case No. 84-27347.  Obligated to repay the loan to PNB secured by the mortgage.
*   **PNB:** Entitled to enforce the Real Estate Mortgage over the property, as it acted in good faith.
*   **Ngos & Sia:** Not entitled to the property.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prior Rulings Ignored by CA:** The CA's decision disregarded prior rulings from the same court (CA-G.R. SP No. 22889 and CA-G.R. SP No. 25819), which determined the validity of the judgement in Civil Case No. 84-27347, despite the issue of Sia not being named.
*   **Good Faith Determination:** While the Court found PNB to be a mortgagee in good faith, such determinations are always fact-specific and subject to argument about the level of due diligence required.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 47 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the effect of judgments and the doctrine of res judicata.
*   **Doctrine of Res Judicata:** Clearly defined and applied. The court emphasizes the two aspects of Res Judicata: Bar by Prior Judgement and Conclusiveness of Judgment.
*   ** Republic v. Yu, G.R. No. 157557, March 10, 2006:** Cited for the definition of Res Judicata.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly applied the doctrine of res judicata, reversing the Court of Appeals' erroneous interpretation and restoring the integrity of the original court decision. The ruling protects PNB's interest as a mortgagee in good faith.
