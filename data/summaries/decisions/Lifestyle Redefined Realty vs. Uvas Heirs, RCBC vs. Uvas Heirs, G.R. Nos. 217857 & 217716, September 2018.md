**Case Summary: *Lifestyle Redefined Realty Corporation v. Heirs of Dennis A. Uvas***

**Citation:** 840 Phil. 164 (2018)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Lifestyle Redefined Realty Corporation (Lifestyle Corp) and Evelyn S. Barte (Buyers)
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Dennis A. Uvas (Original Mortgagors)
*   **Additional Party:** Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) (Mortgagee/Seller)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC's decision nullifying a foreclosure sale, certificate of sale, and subsequent transfer of title.

**Facts:**

1.  **Loan and Mortgage:** U-Bex, controlled by Spouses Uvas, obtained loans from RCBC secured by a Real Estate Mortgage over property covered by TCT No. 190706.
2.  **Foreclosure:** U-Bex defaulted, RCBC foreclosed. Sale occurred 11/24/2003
3.  **RCBC Consolidation:** RCBC consolidated title to the property in 2005 (TCT No. 269709).
4.  **Sale to Lifestyle Corp/Barte:** RCBC sold the property to Lifestyle Corp/Barte.
5.  **Heirs' Complaint:** Heirs of Uvas filed a complaint seeking annulment of the foreclosure sale, alleging lack of notice and improper publication.
6.  **Postponement:** The foreclosure sale was postponed at the request of Nimfa Uvas, without republication of notice.
7.  **Supplemental Complaint:** After RCBC sold the property to Lifestyle Corp and Evelyn, and the annotation of Lis Pendens in TCT No. 269709 in the name of RCBC, respondent Heirs filed a supplemental complaint alleging the sale was void.
8.  **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC and CA ruled in favor of the Heirs, declaring the foreclosure sale and subsequent transfer void. Ordered RCBC to return the amount of Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php20,500,000.00) with interest of 12% per annum from time of filing of the instant Complaint on September 6, 2006 to Lifestyle Corporation and Evelyn.
9. **Arguments:**

* RCBC: The lower courts erred in ordering it to restructure the loan, considering that this was not expressly prayed for by the respondent Heirs in their complaint before the trial court.

* Lifestyle Corporation and Evelyn: They are buyers in good faith considering that the sale between them and RCBC was already perfected on August 24, 2006, way before the inscription of lis pendens in TCT No. 269709, on September 6, 2006.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision, upholding the foreclosure and subsequent sale to Lifestyle Corp/Barte.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Validity of Foreclosure Sale:** Did RCBC comply with requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135? Specifically, the issue of republication after postponement of sale. *Ouano v. Court of Appeals* (446 Phil. 690 (2003) citing *Tambunting v. Court of Appeals* (249 Phil. 16 (1988)) establishes republication as necessary for validity.
2.  **Good Faith Purchaser:** Were Lifestyle Corp/Barte *bona fide* purchasers for value? The SC focused on the good faith of the buyers in purchasing the property. A good faith purchaser is one who buys without notice of a right or interest of another party, and pays the purchase price at the time of sale or before notice of a claim on the property (*Uy v. Fule et al.* 737 Phil. 290, 293 (2014))
3.  **Effect of Lis Pendens:** Did the annotation of lis pendens on RCBC's title constitute sufficient notice to Lifestyle Corp/Barte? The title of the subject property, at the time of the negotiations and payment of the sale was in the name of RCBC and did not contain any indication that respondent Heirs have a claim thereon, or that the foreclosure sale from which RCBC bought the subject property was void.

**Rationale:**

*   **Good Faith:** SC found Lifestyle Corp/Barte to be purchasers in good faith. They relied on the clean title of RCBC and completed payment *before* the lis pendens was annotated. *Heirs of Gregorio Lopez v. Development Bank of the Phils.* (747 Phil. 427, 439 (2014))., *Raul Saberon, et al. v. Ventanilla, Jr., et al.* (733 Phil. 275, 296-297 (2014)).
*   **Estoppel:** The Heirs' mother (Nimfa) brokered the sale and requested the postponement of the auction sale, which weighs against their later claim of defective foreclosure.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **RCBC's Warranty:** Lifestyle Corp/Barte cross-claimed against RCBC for breach of warranty in the Deed of Absolute Sale. Although SC ruled in favor of RCBC, there may have been a potential liability had the buyers been deemed not to be in good faith.
*   **Future Claims:** The decision appears to settle the issue of title.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The condition surrounding Nimfa's request for postponement "without need of republication" and RCBC's reliance on this condition. It is vague in the legal context.

**Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law): Governs the requirements for valid extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   Articles 1497 to 1501 of the Civil Code (Sales): Regarding delivery and transfer of ownership.
