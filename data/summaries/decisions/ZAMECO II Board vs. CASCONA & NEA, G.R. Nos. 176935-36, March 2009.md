**Case Summary: Zambales II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ZAMECO II) Board of Directors vs. Castillejos Consumers Association, Inc. (CASCONA) and National Electrification Administration (NEA)**

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (G.R. Nos. 176935-36, March 13, 2009)

**Key Issue:** Validity of NEA's authority to supervise and discipline the ZAMECO II Board of Directors, particularly after the passage of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) and in light of ZAMECO II's alleged non-compliance of EPIRA requirements when it registered as a cooperative under the Cooperative Development Authority.

**Background:** CASCONA filed a complaint with NEA seeking the removal of ZAMECO II's Board of Directors, citing various offenses, including illegal payments, excessive bonuses, an anomalous contract, and overstaying in office.  NEA issued a resolution ordering the removal of the directors.  The Court of Appeals upheld NEA's authority.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **NEA's Authority:** The Court affirmed NEA's supervisory power over electric cooperatives under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269, as amended by PD No. 1645, despite the EPIRA and the assumption of electric cooperative debts by PSALM Corp.  The court stated NEA's regulatory power is not solely dependent on the existence of loans. Sec. 58 of the EPIRA states that, "NEA shall continue to be under the supervision of the DOE and shall exercise its functions under Presidential Decree No. 269, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1645 insofar as they are consistent with this Act."

*   **Due Process:** The Court found that the Board of Directors was denied due process because the NEA considered the 2003 Audit Report and its disallowances as additional charges without providing the directors a proper opportunity to respond in the administrative proceedings before the ADCOM.  Referenced *Ang Tibay v. CIR* and *Globe Telecom, Inc. v. National Telecommunications Commission* regarding cardinal rights and hearing requirements.

*   **Overstaying Issue:** The Court determined that the issue of directors overstaying was related to serious misconduct and negligence, rather than solely an election-related matter.

*   **ZAMECO II's CDA Registration:** The registration of ZAMECO II with the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) was questionable because the Court stated that the EPIRA requires electric cooperatives to first convert into a stock cooperative before registering with the CDA. The validity of ZAMECO II's CDA registration affects NEA's power to enforce its orders.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **ZAMECO II Board of Directors:**  Potentially liable for illegal payments and excessive bonuses claimed in violation of NEA guidelines. The court cited that the Board was not heard on the charges regarding the 2003 Audit Report.

*   **NEA:** Obligated to provide due process in administrative proceedings, including proper notice and opportunity to be heard.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of NEA Order:** NEA's order to remove directors is partially upheld based on charges relating to the 1998 audit report and the overstaying directors.

*   **Litigation over CDA Registration:** Litigation may arise from challenges to ZAMECO II's registration with the CDA, which impacts NEA's supervisory authority.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269:** Governs the National Electrification Administration.

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1645:** Amends PD No. 269.

*   **Republic Act No. 9136 (EPIRA):**  Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001.

*   **Executive Order No. 460:** Relates to the assumption by PSALM Corp. of electric cooperatives' debts.

*   **Ang Tibay v. CIR, 69 Phil. 635 (1940):** Established cardinal rights in administrative proceedings.

*   **Globe Telecom, Inc. v. National Telecommunications Commission, 479 Phil. 1 (2004):**  Addressed due process requirements in administrative cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent to which the EPIRA altered NEA's supervisory powers.
*   The validity and effect of ZAMECO II's registration with the CDA.
*   The line between administrative and election-related issues regarding the board of directors' tenure.

**Outcome:** The case was remanded to the Court of Appeals to determine if the procedure for ZAMECO II's conversion into a stock cooperative under the CDA complied with the EPIRA and its implementing rules.  The findings of the Court of Appeals are to be transmitted to the Supreme Court for final adjudication.
