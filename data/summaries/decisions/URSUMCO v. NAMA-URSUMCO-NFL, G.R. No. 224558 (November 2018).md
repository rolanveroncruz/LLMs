## Legal Document Summary: Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation v. Nagkahiusang Mamumuo sa URSUMCO-National Federation of Labor (G.R. No. 224558)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's affirmation of the Voluntary Arbitrator's (VA) decision regarding the employment status of certain employees.

**Key Issue:** Whether URSUMCO's regular seasonal employees should be classified as regular/permanent employees due to their continuous performance of repair work during the off-milling season.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA and VA decisions that the concerned employees are considered regular employees, not regular seasonal employees.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement):** Article VI, Section 2 defines employment classifications (Regular vs. Regular Seasonal). URSUMCO argued that the CBA is binding and the Union is estopped from questioning the agreed-upon employee classification.
*   **URSUMCO's Position:** The employer argued that the employees were hired as "regular seasonal" and that the CBA defined their employment. The off-season repair work was an act of "magnanimity," not creating a regular employment status.
*   **Union's Position:** The union argued that the employees performed work related to the business all year and their roles, tasks, and responsibilities are considered regular work.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Employment Status Not Negotiable:** The Court emphasized that while a CBA is the law between parties, *employment status is defined by law* and cannot be bargained away. Cites *Innodata Knowledge Services, Inc. v. Inting.*
*   **Regular vs. Seasonal Employment:** Based on Article 295 of the Labor Code (as amended), and relevant jurisprudence such as *Hacienda Cataywa v. Lorezo*, and *Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation v. Acibo*, the Court distinguished between seasonal and regular employment. The crucial factor is whether the work is performed only during the season or continuously.
*   **"Reasonably Necessary and Desirable" Test:** Cites *Abasolo v. National Labor Relations Commission* for the standard to determine regular employment. The Court found that repair work during the off-milling season is "reasonably necessary and desirable" for URSUMCO's sugar milling business.
*   **Distinction from "Project Employee":** URSUMCO's attempted comparison to *ALU-TUCP v. National Labor Relations Commission* (re: "project employees") was rejected. The Court reasoned that the off-season repairs were *not* a distinct project separate from URSUMCO's regular business but were an integral part of its sugar milling operations.
*   **CBA Interpretation:** Even a reading of the CBA definitions of Regular versus Regular Seasonal employee implies the employees should be considered regular due to their continued work.
*   **Limited Scope of Decision:** The Court clarified that the ruling only applied to the 78 concerned employees and did not automatically regularize all URSUMCO's seasonal employees.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Management Prerogative:** URSUMCO claimed the ruling infringes on its management prerogative to determine organizational structure. This argument was implicitly rejected.
*   **Mootness:** URSUMCO argued the case was moot due to regularization, resignation, retirement, or death of employees. While noted, this argument did not affect the court's decision.
*   **Definition of "Regular Operation":** The definition of "regular operation" can be contentious. While the Court interpreted it broadly to include off-season repairs, future cases might involve different factual scenarios leading to different conclusions.

**Relevant Laws & Case Law:**

*   **Article 295 of the Labor Code (as amended):** Defines types of employment.
*   **Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora:** Recognizes fixed-term employment.
*   **Abasolo v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Establishes the "reasonably necessary and desirable" test for regular employment.
*   **ALU-TUCP v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Discusses the concept of "project employees."
*   **Innodata Knowledge Services, Inc. v. Inting:** Reiterates that employment status is a matter of law, not contract.
*   **Hacienda Cataywa v. Lorezo** and **Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation v. Acibo**: Cases related to seasonal employment

**Summary of Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **URSUMCO:** Required to recognize the 78 concerned employees as regular employees with associated benefits.
*   **Potential Liability:** Could face similar claims from other similarly situated regular seasonal employees who perform work beyond the milling season.
*   **Obligation to Review Employment Practices:** Should review employment classifications and practices to ensure compliance with labor laws and prevent future disputes.
