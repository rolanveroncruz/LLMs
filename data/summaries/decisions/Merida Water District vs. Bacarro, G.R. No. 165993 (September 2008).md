**Legal Document Summary: *Merida Water District v. Bacarro, G.R. No. 165993***

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a Petition for Review on Certiorari, challenging a CA decision that affirmed RTC orders in favor of water utility consumers (Respondents).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Water Rate Increase:** Merida Water District (MWD) implemented a water rate increase of P90 for the first ten cubic meters, confirmed by LWUA Board Resolution No. 63, series of 2002.
*   **Respondents' Challenge:** Consumers filed a Petition for Injunction against MWD, alleging the rate increase violated LOI No. 700 by exceeding 60% of the current rate and lacking a proper public hearing.
*   **Procedural Issue:** MWD argued respondents failed to exhaust administrative remedies under P.D. No. 198, the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973 (as amended by P.D. Nos. 768 and 1479).
*   **Administrative Review:** The law stipulates that after LWUA reviews the rates established by a local district, a water concessionaire may appeal the same to the NWRB. The NWRB's decision may then be appealed to the Office of the President.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **MWD:** Obligated to conduct proper public hearings before increasing water rates (LOI No. 700, LOI 744, Sec. 63, P.D. 198). Subject to NWRB review to ensure rates comply with legal requirements.
*   **Respondents:** Obligated to exhaust administrative remedies (appeal to NWRB) before seeking judicial intervention.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Current Rate" Definition:** Ambiguity exists regarding the "current rate" used as the basis for calculating the allowable 60% increase under LOI No. 700. This is a question of fact needing resolution.
*   **Sufficiency of Public Hearing:** The RTC did not investigate whether rates presented in the hearing were the same rates approved by the LWUA. Compliance with due process and LOI public hearing requirements is at issue.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 198 (Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973) & Amendments (P.D. Nos. 768, 1479):** Governs the establishment and operation of water districts, including rate setting and review. Specifically Section 63.
*   **LOI No. 700:** Restricts water rate increases to no more than 60% of the current rate.
*   **LOI 744:** Requires water districts to prepare a system of public consultation when considering increases in water rates.
*   ***Executive Order No. 124-A:*** Renamed the National Water Resources Council to the NWRB.
*   **Case Law on Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** *Carale v. Abarintos, G.R. No. 120704*; *Sunville Timber Products, Inc. v. Abad, G.R. No. 85502*; *Celestial v. Cachopero, 459 Phil. 903 (2003)*; *China Banking Corporation v. Members of the Board of Trustees, Home Development Mutual Fund, G.R. No. 131787*; *Villanueva v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 99357*; *Pagara v. Court of Appeals, 325 Phil. 66 (1996)*; *Samahang Magbubukid ng Kapdula, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 103953*; *Marilao Water Consumers Association, inc. v. Intermediate appellate Court, G.R. No. 72807*. These cases highlight the necessity of exhausting remedies unless the assailed act is *patently illegal* or there is denial of due process.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central point of contention revolves around whether respondents were required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing with the RTC.
*   The petitioners argues this point while respondents justify their failure to exhaust administrative process due to the grounds: (1) that petitioners' increase of the water rate is patently illegal; and (2) a denial of due process.

**Court Ruling & Implications:**

*   **SC Held:** The SC *granted* the petition. The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision was *reversed* because the respondents failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The determination of whether MWD's rate increase was "patently illegal" requires factual findings that should have been made by the NWRB in the first instance.
*   **Implication:** Reinforces the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Establishes that water rate disputes under P.D. No. 198 must first be addressed through the administrative process (LWUA review, then appeal to NWRB, then appeal to the Office of the President) before judicial recourse is available.
