**Case Summary: *Co v. People*, G.R. No. 160265**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA resolutions dismissing a petition for certiorari and prohibition against an RTC order denying a Motion to Quash an Information for violation of Section 22(d) in relation to Section 28(e) of RA 1161, as amended by RA 8282 (Social Security Law).

**Facts:**

*   Nely Co was charged with failing to remit SSS contributions for spouses Jose and Mercedes Lim, alleged employees.
*   Co moved to quash, arguing no employer-employee relationship existed, citing a prior NLRC ruling in an illegal dismissal case (NLRC-NCR-Case No. 00-03-01826-2000) where the Lims were deemed independent contractors, decision finalized on December 20, 2001.
*   RTC denied the Motion to Quash.
*   CA dismissed Co's Petition due to failure to implead necessary parties (People, SSS, OSG, and Lims).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 1161, Section 22(d) and Section 28(e):** Addresses the obligations of employers to remit SSS contributions and penalties for non-compliance. (While it cites Section 22(d), the decision appears to refer to Section 22(a) & (b)).
*   **Compulsory Coverage:** Hinges on the existence of an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 37, Section 1(a):** Grounds for Motion for New Trial and Reconsideration.

**Liabilities:**

*   The potential criminal liability of the employer for failure to remit SSS contributions.
*   Employer liability for contributions and penalties.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition and ORDERED the dismissal of the criminal case. The SC reasoned that it was the NLRC that should settle disputes arising under RA 1161, regarding coverage, benefits, contributions, and penalties.

**Key Legal Principles and Case Law:**

*   **Res Judicata (Conclusiveness of Judgment):** Final judgment in NLRC (illegal dismissal case) regarding the employer-employee relationship is binding in the criminal case. Cites *Smith Bell & Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 59692, and *Constantino v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 140656, applying the doctrine of res judicata specifically as "conclusiveness of judgment."
*   **Jurisdiction of SSC:** Acknowledges *Republic v. Asiapro Cooperative*, G.R. No. 172101, which affirmed the Social Security Commission (SSC) jurisdiction over disputes concerning employer-employee relationships for SSS coverage purposes; however, it distinguished Asiapro by stating the issue of employer-employee relationship had already been decided by the NLRC.
*   **Application of Rules of Court:** Rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on NLRC Decision:** The decision hinges on the binding effect of the NLRC ruling, even though the RTC had concurrent jurisdiction to determine employer-employee relationships, raising the question of *primary jurisdiction*. However, the SC justified its decision because the NLRC finding was *final*.
*   **Erroneous Information:** The SC mentioned the criminal case was premised on the existence of an employer-employee relationship, making a conviction of the petitioner a transgression of constitutional rights.
*   **Correct Statutory Reference:** The information cited Sec. 22(d), which appears incorrect. Sec. 22(a) & (b) appear to be the correct provisions that should have been cited.

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main ambiguity lies in the court's seeming acceptance of extrinsic fraud as a valid ground for a motion of reconsideration.
*   This also contradicts the court's statement that no other ground aside from extrinsic fraud was asserted.
*   The RTC's jurisdiction is not clearly established in the case.
