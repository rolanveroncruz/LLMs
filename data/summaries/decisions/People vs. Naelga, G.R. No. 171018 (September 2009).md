## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Naelga, G.R. No. 171018

**Nature:** Appeal under Rule 45 challenging CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).

**Key Facts:**

*   **Accused:** Elly Naelga (Appellant)
*   **Charge:** Illegal sale of 0.4 grams of shabu to a poseur-buyer (PO2 Noe Sembran) in a buy-bust operation.
*   **Venue:** Rosales, Pangasinan.
*   **Evidence:** Testimony of PO2 Sembran (poseur-buyer) and PO1 Rosauro Valdez (backup), marked money, confiscation receipt, chemistry report confirming substance as shabu, and the sachet of shabu itself. The defense admitted the existence, authenticity, and due execution of the Chemistry Report.
*   **Defense:** Denied selling drugs; claimed PO2 Sembran asked him to buy shabu, leaving money, which he took and used to purchase the drug in Urdaneta City and deliver it to the officer. Alleges instigation and questionable chain of custody.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 5, Art. II, R.A. 9165:** Penalizes the unauthorized sale of dangerous drugs with life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P1,000,000.00.
*   **Sec. 21, R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules (IRR):**  Establishes procedures for the handling of seized drugs, including inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, media, DOJ, and elected officials. However, non-compliance is not fatal if integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   **RTC and CA rulings:** Convicted of illegal sale of *shabu*; sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. The Supreme Court affirmed this ruling.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:**  Appellant argued the police failed to observe the proper guidelines in securing the chain of custody of the prohibited drugs. The Supreme Court acknowledged that, although the police may not have strictly followed Section 21 of R.A. 9165, their failure to comply with the procedure did not invalidate the seizure and custody over the items.
*   **Instigation vs. Entrapment:**  Appellant claimed instigation, arguing PO2 Sembran initiated the transaction. The Court found entrapment, emphasizing the idea originated from the offender. The test: whether the idea of committing the crime originated from the accused, *People v. Yumang*.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  Appellant questioned the inconsistent and incredible testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. The Court held that they had access only to cold, impersonal records of the proceedings, relying upon the assessment of the trial court.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sec. 5, Art. II:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. Establishes the crime and corresponding penalties.
*   **R.A. 9165, Sec. 21(1), Art. II:** Mandates the procedure for custody and disposition of confiscated, seized and/or surrendered dangerous drugs, including inventory and photography of the evidence.
*   **People v. Lua Chu and Uy Se Tieng, 56 Phil. 44 (1931):** Defines the distinction between instigation and entrapment in the context of drug offenses.
*   **People v. Yumang, G.R. No. 94977, 17 May 1993, 222 SCRA 119:** Defined the elements of instigation versus entrapment.
*   **People v. De los Reyes, G.R. No. 106874, 21 January 1994, 229 SCRA 439:** States the police officerâ€™s failure to comply with said DDB Regulation No. 3, Series of 1979 is irrelevant to the prosecution of the criminal case
*   **People v. Bongalon, 425 Phil. 96, 116 (2002):** Established if a frame-up is to prosper, the defense must be able to present clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity,

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the totality of evidence, including the testimony of the police officers, the recovered *shabu*, and the appellant's own admission of purchasing and delivering the drugs. The Court considered the Appellant's defense of instigation and the claim of a broken chain of custody but rejected both, emphasizing that strict compliance with procedural rules is not mandatory if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. It is noteworthy that the court applied the presumption of regularity in performance of official duties of the police officers involved.
