**Legal Document Summary: Fernando v. Commission on Audit (COA)**

**Case Citation:** G.R. Nos. 237938 and 237944-45, December 04, 2018 (844 Phil. 664; 115 OG No. 45, 12562)

**Issue:** Whether the Commission on Audit (COA) has audit jurisdiction over the Executive Committee of the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the COA *does* have audit jurisdiction over the MMFF Executive Committee. The petition for certiorari was dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **COA's Audit Jurisdiction (Sec. 2, Art. IX-D, 1987 Constitution):**  COA has the power to audit funds "owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations."  The case references *Funa v. Manila Economic and Cultural Office* and Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 (Auditing Code of the Philippines) to define the scope of entities subject to COA's audit.
*   **MMFF Executive Committee Nature:** The SC determined that while the MMFF Executive Committee is *not* a Government-Owned or Controlled Corporation (GOCC) per the Administrative Code of 1987 definition (agency organized as stock or non-stock corporation), its administrative relationship to the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) brings it under COA jurisdiction.
*   **MMDA's Status (RA 7924):** The MMDA is a government agency performing administrative, coordinating, and policy-setting functions in Metro Manila. The SC cites *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc.* to reinforce MMDA's role.
*   **Funds as Public Funds:** The Court held that the funds of the MMFF Executive Committee, sourced from both local government unit donations and non-tax revenues (private donations), are considered public funds once received by the Executive Committee. Cites: *Confederation of Coconut Farmers Organizations of the Philippines, Inc. (CCFOP) v. His Excellency President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, et al* and *The Veterans Federation of the Phils. represented by Esmeraldo R. Acordo v. Hon. Reyes* re public purpose and donation to the government as factors creating government ownership of the funds.
*   **Relevance of Proclamation No. 1459:** The Court relies heavily on Presidential Proclamation No. 1459 and subsequent Executive Orders which declared the creation and organization of the MMFF establishing the relationship between the Executive Committee of the MMFF and Metro Manila's (now the MMDA's) authority.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Bayani Fernando):** As Chairman of the MMFF Executive Committee, the petitioner is liable for the disallowed amounts (P3,000,000.00) per the Notices of Disallowance (NDs) issued by the COA. The petitioner is also responsible for making sure the amount of P1,000,000 paid to him by the Metro Manila Film Festival Executive Committee is addressed.
*   **MMFF Executive Committee:** Subject to COA's audit rules and regulations regarding the receipt and disbursement of funds.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of NDs:** The COA can enforce the Notices of Disallowance, potentially leading to legal action to recover the disallowed funds from the petitioner and other liable parties.
*   **Future Audit Findings:** The ruling establishes a precedent for future COA audits of the MMFF Executive Committee.
*   **Risk of Sanctions:** Irregular use of public funds may be subject to penal sanctions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article IX-D, Section 2**
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 (Auditing Code of the Philippines)**
*   **Administrative Code of 1987**
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7924 (MMDA Charter)**
*   **Presidential Proclamation No. 1459**
*   **Funa v. Manila Economic and Cultural Office, et al., 726 Phil. 63 (2014).**
*   **Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc., 385 Phil. 586 (2000).**
*   **Confederation of Coconut Farmers Organizations of the Philippines, Inc. (CCFOP) v. His Excellency President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, et al., G.R. No. 217965, August 8, 2017.**
*   **The Veterans Federation of the Phils. represented by Esmeraldo R. Acordo v. Hon. Reyes, 518 Phil. 668 (2006).**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The key contentious point is the determination of whether the MMFF Executive Committee, primarily composed of private individuals (albeit in conjunction with relevant government authority), is subject to COA scrutiny, given that it receives private funding, along with LGU funds.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   The SC distinguished the MMFF Executive Committee from the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO), finding that MECO is a non-stock corporation incorporated body, where as the Executive Committee is an office under MMDA.
*   The COA disallowance was based on irregularities in the payment process (specifically, the absence of an official receipt)
