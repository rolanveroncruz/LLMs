**Case Summary: *People v. Bartolome*, G.R. No. 129486**

**Nature:** This case involves a review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Gloria Bartolome for four counts of illegal recruitment (Art. 38(b), Labor Code) and four counts of estafa (Art. 315, 2(A), Revised Penal Code). The CA modified the illegal recruitment conviction to illegal recruitment in large scale (victimizing 3 or more persons), increasing the penalty to life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Art. 38(b) Labor Code, Art. 13(b) Labor Code):** The core issue is whether Bartolome engaged in recruitment and placement without the necessary license or authority from the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The prosecution presented evidence that she promised employment in Bahrain for a fee to four individuals. The definition of recruitment and placement hinges on “any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment.”
*   **Large Scale Illegal Recruitment (Art. 39(a) Labor Code):** The CA elevated the charges because Bartolome victimized four individuals (Fe Rollon, Raymundo Dimatulac, Esperanza Buhay, and Reynaldo Rollon). Case law like *People v. Dela Piedra, G.R. No. 121777* defines large-scale illegal recruitment as involving three or more victims. This triggers a penalty of life imprisonment and a P100,000 fine.
*   **Estafa (Art. 315, 2(A), Revised Penal Code):** The estafa charges stem from Bartolome's alleged misappropriation of the fees paid by the complainants, failing to deliver on the promised overseas employment, and ignoring repeated demands for reimbursement. The prosecution needed to prove false pretenses or fraudulent means were used by Bartolome to induce the complainants to part with their money.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Bartolome challenged the credibility of the complainants, but both the RTC and CA found their testimonies to be credible and consistent, especially about the payment of fees, promised jobs, and unmet obligations.
*   **Bartolome's Defense:** Bartolome argued that she was not involved in the recruitment and blamed a certain Capawan for the recruitment and defrauding the complainants. This defense was rejected by the lower courts as self-serving and contradicted by the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses.
*   **Flight and Abandonment of Appeal:** The Court noted that Bartolome jumped bail during the appeal process. While the appeal was not automatically dismissed, her flight could negatively impact how the court views her credibility and defense.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Bartolome was found liable for life imprisonment and a P100,000 fine for illegal recruitment in a large scale.
*   She was also ordered to indemnify the victims for the amounts they paid to her:
    *   Fe Rollon: P16,500.00
    *   Esperanza Buhay: P16,500.00
    *   Reynaldo Rollon: P16,500.00
    *   Raymundo Dimatulac: P15,850.00

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidence Sufficiency for Estafa:** The case summary states that conviction for estafa was deemed affirmed with finality.
*   **Validity of Arrest Warrants**: Court commanded the NBI and PNP to arrest the accused appellant, Gloria Bartolome.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Art. 13(b), 38(b), 39(a)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 315, 2(A)
*   Rules of Court, Sec. 13, Rule 124

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Dela Piedra, G.R. No. 121777* is cited to support the definition of illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the CA's decision, convicting Bartolome of illegal recruitment in large scale and imposing the corresponding penalty. The key to the conviction was the credible testimonies of multiple complainants, the absence of a license to recruit, and Bartolome's failure to rebut the prosecution's evidence effectively.
