Here's a legal summary of *Everett Steamship Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Hernandez Trading Co. Inc.*, focusing on key aspects for legal analysis:

**Case Summary:**

*   **Citation:** *Everett Steamship Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Hernandez Trading Co. Inc.*, G.R. No. 122494, October 8, 1998 (358 Phil. 129).
*   **Issue:** Whether a carrier's liability for lost cargo is limited to a stipulated amount in the bill of lading (Y100,000), despite the actual value of the cargo being higher, and whether the consignee is bound by the terms of the bill of lading even if not a direct party to the contract.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Bill of Lading:** Bill of Lading No. NGO53MN governed the shipment, containing a limitation of liability clause (Clause 18).
    *   **Clause 18:** Limits the carrier's liability to ¥100,000 per package unless a higher value is declared in writing by the shipper before receipt of goods and inserted in the Bill of Lading, with extra freight paid.
*   **Civil Code Articles 1749 & 1750:** These articles validate stipulations limiting a carrier's liability if reasonable, just, and freely/fairly agreed upon.  The agreement to a lower valuation is permissible if the shipper had the opportunity to declare a higher one.
*   **Article 1735:** Provides for the presumption of negligence on the part of the carrier in case of loss. The carrier has the burden of overcoming this presumption.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that the carrier's liability was limited to ¥100,000.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Validity of Limitation Clause:** The limitation of liability clause in the bill of lading was deemed valid and enforceable under Articles 1749 and 1750 of the Civil Code. It was considered reasonable as the shipper had the option to declare a higher value.
2.  **Contract of Adhesion:** The Court acknowledged the bill of lading as a contract of adhesion, but found it valid. The shipper wasn't ignorant and was capable of understanding the business transaction.
3.  **Consignee Bound by Bill of Lading:** The consignee (Hernandez Trading), by claiming reimbursement based on the bill of lading and filing suit, effectively accepted the contract's provisions and was bound by its limitations, even though it was not a signatory.
4.  **Lack of Declaration of Higher Value:** The shipper's invoice (Invoice No. MTM-941) showing the cargo's value wasn't sufficient to defeat the limitation. The bill of lading required a *written declaration* of higher value *in the bill of lading itself,* and the payment of extra freight.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Contract of Adhesion Concerns:** While upheld, contracts of adhesion warrant scrutiny to protect weaker parties from deceptive clauses (citing Article 24 of the Civil Code).
*   **Interpretation of "Fair and Free Agreement":** The ruling hinged on the shipper's assumed commercial sophistication. Challenges could arise if the shipper lacked actual knowledge or understanding of the limitation clause, or if there was evidence of duress or unequal bargaining power.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Sea Land Service, Inc. vs Intermediate Appellate Court, 153 SCRA 552 [1987]:***  Reiterated the validity of limitation of liability clauses and the consignee's ability to be bound by a bill of lading.
*   ***PAL, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 255 SCRA 63 [1996]:*** Confirms that adhesion contracts are not invalid *per se* and can be binding.
*   ***Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Sweet Lines, Inc., 212 SCRA 194, 212-213 [1992]:***  Addresses adherence to contracts and the responsibility of comprehension.
*   ***Ong Yiu vs Court of Appeals, 91 SCRA 223 [1979]:***  Further elaborates on the validity and binding effect of stipulations in contracts of adhesion.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code of the Philippines, Articles 1735, 1749, 1750.

**Conclusion:**

The case confirms the enforceability of limitation of liability clauses in bills of lading under Philippine law, provided that the shipper had the opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignee asserts rights under that bill of lading. This holding places a burden on shippers to carefully review and understand bills of lading and to declare a higher valuation if necessary. The Court's reliance on the shipper's presumed sophistication could be challenged in cases where the shipper lacked actual knowledge or bargaining power.
