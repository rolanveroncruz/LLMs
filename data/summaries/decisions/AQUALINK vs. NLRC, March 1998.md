**Case Summary: AQUALINK MARITIME INC. AND WORLDER SHIPPING LTD. vs. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (4TH DIVISION) AND ANDREI BORGONIA**

**Citation:** 350 Phil. 878 (G.R. No. 127979, March 11, 1998)

**Nature of Action:** Special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65, assailing NLRC resolutions dismissing an appeal as untimely.

**Key Issue:** Timeliness of the appeal from the Labor Arbiter's decision.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, SET ASIDE the NLRC resolutions, and DIRECTED the NLRC to resolve the appeal on the merits.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code:** Specifies a 10-day period for appealing decisions of the Labor Arbiter to the NLRC. This is the central statutory reference.
*   **NLRC New Rules of Procedure, Rule VI, Section 1:** Extends the appeal period if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. This rule favors the petitioners.
*   **Conflicting Evidence on Receipt Date:** The NLRC based its decision on a registry return receipt allegedly showing receipt on July 30, 1996. Petitioners presented a certification from the Postmaster stating receipt was on July 31, 1996. The SC gave weight to the Postmaster's certification, finding the return receipt ambiguous.
*   **Calculation of Appeal Period:** The court calculated the 10-day period from July 31, 1996. It noted that August 10, 1996, fell on a Saturday, thus extending the deadline to the next working day (August 12, 1996), on which the appeal was filed.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **NLRC's Potential for a Merits-Based Decision Against Petitioners:** The case is remanded to the NLRC, and the ultimate outcome depends on the merits of Andrei Borgonia's original labor complaint. This is a potential liability, depending on the facts of the underlying case.
*   **Risk of Future Procedural Challenges:** While this specific appeal was deemed timely, future procedural errors could jeopardize the case.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Olacao v. NLRC, 177 SCRA 38 (1989):** Cited by the OSG, though ultimately distinguished by the court, illustrating established precedent regarding the computation of periods when deadlines fall on non-working days.
*   **SM Agri and General Machineries v. NLRC, 169 SCRA 20 (1989):** precedent regarding the computation of periods when deadlines fall on non-working days

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The date of receipt of the Labor Arbiter's decision as evidenced by the registry return receipt. The ambiguity allowed the Court to consider alternative evidence (Postmaster's certification).

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case concerns a procedural issue regarding the timeliness of an appeal to the NLRC. The NLRC dismissed the appeal based on a registry return receipt showing receipt on July 30. Petitioners successfully argued they received the decision on July 31, supported by a Postmaster's certification. The Supreme Court, applying Article 223 of the Labor Code and the NLRC's rules on extending deadlines falling on weekends, found the appeal timely. The case is remanded to the NLRC for a decision on the merits. The key is the Postmaster's certification and the application of procedural rules when a deadline falls on a Saturday. While the appeal was successful, the client faces potential liability if the underlying labor case is decided against them.
