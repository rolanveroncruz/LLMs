## Legal Document Summary: Gavino vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 120154

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision regarding the annulment of fraudulent sales of registered property with reconveyance and damages.

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over registered land (9.3540 hectares, TCT No. 896, later TCT No. 4873, TCT No. 4874, TCT No. 5244, TCT No. 10503) originally purchased by Luis P. Arejola under a Deed of Conditional Sale from RFC (later DBP).

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Heirs of Spouses Benito Gavino and Juana Euste (represented by Amparo G. Pesebre and Belen G. Verceluz) - Claim ownership based on purchase from Atty. Jacobo Briones.
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals and Juana Vda. de Arejola (represented by Flavia Reyes), as the estate of Luis P. Arejola. - Claim the land is part of the estate and sales were fraudulent.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Conditional Sale & Subsequent Payments:** Luis P. Arejola initially purchased the land under a conditional sale from RFC, succeeded by DBP. Juana Vda. de Arejola revived and re-amortized the debt.
*   **Sale by Juana de Arejola:** Juana, while initially an administratrix with authority to sell, later sold the property to the Gavino spouses via *pacto de retro* (sale with right to repurchase) *after* her authority was revoked and the land had been transferred to her name. This is a contentious point.
*   **Sale by Atty. Briones:** Juana fictitiously sold the property to the estate lawyer, Atty. Jacobo Briones. Briones then mortgaged the property to PNB. Subsequently sold property to the Gavino spouses, after they learned from him that the property was already under his name.
*   **Mortgage to PNB:** Atty. Briones mortgaged the property to PNB, further complicating the ownership claims.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The Court ultimately determines that the Gavino spouses were good faith purchasers for value relying on the Torrens Title in the name of Atty. Briones and conducting due diligence.
*   **Juana's Liability:** Although the Gavino spouses retain the land, the Court recognizes Juana's liability to the estate for appropriating the conjugal property of Luis and Juana.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Juana Vda. de Arejola's Liability to Estate:** Juana is liable to the estate for fraudulently transferring ownership of the entire land to herself, including her husband's share.
*   **Risk of Title Challenge:** The heirs of Arejola can still pursue a claim against Juana's estate for the value of Luis's conjugal share.
*   **Potential Claims Against Atty. Briones' Estate:** The estate of Luis P. Arejola may have a claim against Atty. Briones for professional misconduct or fraud relating to the sale.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 160, New Civil Code:** Presumption of conjugal property.
*   **Art. 1491, New Civil Code:** Prohibition against administrator purchasing estate property.
*   **Act 496 (Land Registration Act)/Torrens System:** Protection for good faith purchasers for value relying on certificates of title.

**Case Law:**

*   **Fule v. de Legare, No. L-17951, 28 February 1963, 7 SCRA 351, 356:** Definition of a purchaser in good faith.
*   **Noel v. CA, G.R. Nos. 59550 and 60636, 11 January 1995, 240 SCRA 78:** Holding property as trustee for estate.
*   **Macquiling v. Umadhay, No. L-25147, 29 May 1970, 33 SCRA 99, 103:** Due diligence by purchaser.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Juana's Authority to Sell:** Whether the Gavino spouses were truly unaware of Juana's lack of authority to sell as administratrix, despite her revocation.
*   **Nature of Sale to Atty. Briones:** Whether the sale to Atty. Briones was truly fictitious.
*   **Due Diligence by Gavino:** The extent of the Gavinos' due diligence in verifying the ownership of the property when buying from Juana under the "pacto de retro" agreement is questionable, since she could not produce documentation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the rights of the Gavino heirs as good faith purchasers for value. Although the sale by Juana to the Gavinos was technically invalid due to the absence of judicial authority and possible breach of trust, the Court prioritized the stability of the Torrens system. The estate of Luis P. Arejola's recourse is to pursue a claim against the estate of Juana Vda. de Arejola for the value of Luis's share in the conjugal property. Potential claims against the estate of Atty. Briones should also be considered.
