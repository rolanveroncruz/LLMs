## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Pabol, G.R. No. 187084

**Case Summary:** This is a Philippine Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Carlito Pabol for simple rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.  The conviction is based on circumstantial evidence.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Simple Rape (Art. 266-A(1), RPC, as amended)
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua
*   **Damages:**
    *   ₱50,000.00 Civil Indemnity
    *   ₱50,000.00 Moral Damages
    *   ₱30,000.00 Exemplary Damages (added by the Supreme Court)

**Facts:**

*   Accused assaulted a 14-year-old girl (AAA) on her way to school.
*   The victim was hit, lost consciousness, and found later with injuries and bloodstained underwear.
*   A medical examination revealed a healed hymenal laceration.
*   Accused admitted to assaulting the victim but denied rape.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Accused: Liable for the crime of rape and associated penalties and damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction hinges on circumstantial evidence, raising the standard of proof required and the inherent vulnerabilities of such evidence (Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court). The defense argued the lack of direct evidence of penetration and questioned the source of blood and hymenal laceration.
*   **Unconsciousness of Victim:** The victim's unconsciousness during part of the incident poses a challenge to direct testimony about the sexual act.
*   **Medical Evidence:**  The healed hymenal laceration and the doctor's testimony that the laceration could have been caused by various factors (including prior sexual intercourse, trauma or injection) and the doctor's testimony regarding the severity of the lacerations can be used as an argument against the conclusion.
*   **Amended Information:** The court acknowledges the defense's point regarding the original amended charge of Rape with Less Serious Physical Injuries but affirms on the crime of simple rape only given the establishment of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A(1), Revised Penal Code (as amended):** Defines the crime of Rape.
*   **Section 4, Rule 133, Rules of Court:** Governs the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for conviction.
*   **People v. Delim, G.R. No. 142773:**  Sets forth the requirements for circumstantial evidence to support a conviction.
*   **People v. Coja, People v. Darilay, People v. Abulencia, People v. Salonga, et al., People v. Sabardan, People v. Gaufo, and People v. Perez:** Cites cases where rape conviction was based on circumstantial evidence where the victims were unconscious.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Points:**

*   The precise timeline of events while the victim was unconscious is crucial.
*   The medical testimony regarding the hymenal laceration could be interpreted differently, potentially undermining the prosecution's case.

**Overall Assessment:**

The conviction is based on a strong inference of guilt derived from a chain of circumstances. However, the defense will likely continue to challenge the interpretation of the circumstantial evidence, focusing on the lack of direct evidence of penetration, alternative explanations for the physical findings, and the reliability of witness testimony. The award of exemplary damages is a significant point, reinforcing the court's commitment to protecting victims of sexual assault.
