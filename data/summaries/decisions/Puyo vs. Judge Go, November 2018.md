## Legal Document Summary: *Cipriano G. Puyo v. Judge James V. Go* (A.M. No. MTJ-07-1677)

**Subject:** Administrative matter against Judge James V. Go for grave misconduct, dereliction of duty, and delay in rendering judgment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Charge:** Judge Go (MTCC Butuan City) was charged with:
    *   Grave misconduct (misfeasance)
    *   Dereliction of Duty
    *   Undue Delay in rendering judgment in Criminal Cases No. 23657-23661 (BP 22 violations).
*   **Underlying Facts:** Delay stemmed from failure to act on:
    *   Motion for Contempt (filed Nov 25, 2004)
    *   Motion to Dismiss (filed Jan 13, 2005)
    *   Inquiry on Status (July 25, 2005)
    *   Failure to submit responsive comment to the Court Administrator.
*   **Judge's Obligation:**
    *   To administer justice impartially and without delay (Rule 1.02, Code of Judicial Conduct).
    *   To dispose of court business promptly and decide cases within required periods (Canon 3, Rule 3.05, Code of Judicial Conduct).
    *   To perform judicial duties efficiently, fairly, and with reasonable promptness (Section 5, Canon 6, New Code of Judicial Conduct).
    *   To comply with directives of the Court Administrator and Supreme Court.
    *   To timely and completely respond to allegations of misconduct.
*   **Sanctions (per Rule 140, Rules of Court):**
    * Undue delay is classified as a Less Serious Charge
    * **Sanction imposed**: P11,000 fine. The judge had previously been dismissed from service and this fine was to be paid directly or deducted from accrued leave.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Guilty of Undue Delay in Rendering an Order and Insubordination.** The Supreme Court held Judge Go liable for undue delay due to failure to act on pending motions and his disregard for directives from the Court Administrator.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **No specific contentious clauses are evident.** The case hinges on the judge's failure to act and respond.
*   **Mitigation:** While initially failing to fully respond to the administrative complaint, the court acknowledged the respondent did submit some initial comment, which it weighed in finding him guilty of lesser offenses than gross misconduct and insubordination
*    **Double Jeopardy:** Arguably, the dismissal from service may be a greater punishment, and this fine might be perceived as excessive in light of the previous penalty.
