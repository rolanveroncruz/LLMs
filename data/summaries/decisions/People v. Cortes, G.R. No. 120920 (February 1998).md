## Legal Document Summary - People v. Cortes, G.R. No. 120920

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Cristituto Cortes y Palcatan and Ariel Cortes y Plebias*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Second Division)

**Citation:** 349 Phil. 966 (G.R. No. 120920, February 12, 1998)

**Summary:** This case involves an appeal by Cristituto Cortes and Ariel Cortes from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting them of murder for the death of Juanito Perez. The RTC sentenced Cristituto to *reclusion perpetua* and Ariel to an indeterminate sentence due to his voluntary surrender. Both were held jointly and severally liable for damages to the victim's heirs. The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Murder, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation (although evident premeditation appears unsupported by the facts presented).
*   **Accused's Plea:** Not guilty; Ariel initially offered to plead guilty to homicide, but the prosecution rejected this offer.
*   **Prosecution's Evidence:** Testimony established Ariel stabbed the victim, Juanito Perez, without provocation, followed by Cristituto boxing the victim after he fled. Witness also testified to overheard conversation indicating premeditation.
*   **Defense's Argument:** Defense of a relative (Cristituto). Ariel claimed he was defending Cristituto, who was allegedly being attacked by the victim.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found the accused guilty of murder, finding conspiracy and treachery. Acknowledged Ariel's voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC ruling.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Cristituto Cortes: *Reclusion perpetua*. Ariel Cortes: Indeterminate sentence (10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*).
*   **Civil Liability:** Both accused are jointly and severally liable to pay P50,000.00 in damages to the victim's heirs, plus costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Relative:** The court rejected the defense of a relative, finding a failure to prove unlawful aggression by the victim (*People v. Quino*, 232 SCRA 400 [1994]). The burden of proof lies with the accused.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Supreme Court found sufficient evidence of conspiracy based on an overheard conversation and the coordinated actions of the accused. The standard for inferring conspiracy relies on demonstrating a "concurrence of wills, a common intent or design to commit a crime" (*People v. Layno, et al.*, G.R. No. 110833, November 21, 1996).
*   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court upheld the finding of treachery based on the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack on the unarmed and unsuspecting victim (*People v. Isleta*, G.R. No. 114971, November 19, 1996). The element of surprise appears to be the main factor here.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The inconsistencies between Ariel's testimonies to the police and during the trial, as well as conflicting medical evidence presented by Cristituto, negatively impacted their credibility and the acceptance of their arguments.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Article 8 (Conspiracy), Article 11 (Justifying Circumstances - Defense of Relative).
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *People v. Quino*, 232 SCRA 400 [1994] (Unlawful Aggression); *People v. Layno, et al.*, G.R. No. 110833, November 21, 1996 (Conspiracy); *People v. Isleta*, G.R. No. 114971, November 19, 1996 (Treachery).
