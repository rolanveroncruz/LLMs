## Legal Document Summary: PCGG v. Gutierrez, et al. (G.R. No. 189800)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the Ombudsman's dismissal of PCGG's complaint for violation of Sections 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) against members of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) Board of Directors and officers of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation (BISUDECO).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Alleged Offense:** Granting of behest loans by PNB to BISUDECO from 1971-1985, causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits to BISUDECO (Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of RA 3019).
*   **Defendants:** Members of PNB Board of Directors and Officers of BISUDECO during the loan periods.
*   **Ombudsman's Resolution:** Dismissal of the complaint due to prescription and lack of probable cause.

**Obligations/Liabilities Alleged:**

*   PNB Board members are alleged to have violated RA 3019 by approving loans to BISUDECO despite its insufficient capital and collateral, thus causing undue injury to the government. BISUDECO officers are alleged to have conspired in this violation.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   Criminal prosecution under RA 3019, potentially leading to imprisonment and penalties.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Sections 3(e) (causing undue injury) and 3(g) (entering into manifestly disadvantageous contracts) are the core statutory provisions. The Court cites *Singian, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan (Third Division), 514 Phil. 536, 546-547 (2005).*
*   **Batas Pambansa (BP) Blg. 195:** Amended RA 3019, increasing the prescription period from 10 to 15 years.  The Court follows *People v. Pacificador, 406 Phil. 774 (2001)*, holding the longer period cannot be retroactively applied if it prejudices the accused.
*   **RA 3326:** Governs the prescription of offenses punishable under special acts. Section 2 states prescription runs from the day of the commission of the violation, or if not known at the time, from the discovery thereof.
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans, et al. v. Hon. Desierto, et al., 375 Phil. 697 (1999) and 664 Phil. 16 (2011):** Held that for behest loans, the prescriptive period begins to run from the date of discovery, applying the "blameless ignorance" doctrine. *Disini v. Sandiganbayan, 717 Phil. 638 (2013)* reiterates this. *PCGG v. The Ombudsman, et al., 746 Phil. 995 (2014)* applies it to a specific behest loan case.
*   **Buchanan v. Viuda De Esteban, 32 Phil. 365 (1915):** Defines probable cause.
*   **Kara-an v. Office of the Ombudsman, 476 Phil. 536 (2004):** Approving a loan as a director does not automatically establish probable cause absent a showing of personal participation in any irregularity.
*   **Dichaves v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. Nos. 206310-11, December 7, 2016, 813 SCRA 273.:** Reiterates non-interference in the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause absent grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Corporation Code, Section 31:** Discusses liability of corporate directors and officers for unlawful acts, gross negligence, or bad faith. *Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corp. v. Morning Star Travel & Tours, Inc., et al., 763 Phil. 428, 436 (2015)*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Date of Discovery:** PCGG argued for a later discovery date to avoid prescription. Court found that the date of the Terminal Report, submitted in 1994 classifying the BISUDECO loans as behest loans, marked the date of discovery.
*   **Individual Participation:** PCGG argued that it wasn't necessary to pinpoint the specific participation of each board member during the preliminary investigation stage. The Court disagreed, stating that mere membership on the board is insufficient to establish probable cause. The Court's ruling on *Kara-an v. Office of the Ombudsman, 476 Phil. 536 (2004)* is crucial here.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The PCGG's reliance on board membership and minutes excerpts, without direct evidence of individual involvement in specific irregularities, was deemed insufficient by the Ombudsman and upheld by the Court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Ombudsman's dismissal. The Court held that the offenses related to the loans granted from 1971 to 1981 had prescribed and that even for loans within the prescriptive period, PCGG failed to establish probable cause against the individual defendants. The mere fact that the individuals were members of the PNB board was insufficient, absent specific evidence of their participation in the alleged illegal acts. This decision reinforces the principle that corporate directors are not automatically liable for corporate actions and highlights the need for specific evidence of individual involvement in alleged wrongdoing. The Court defers to the discretion of the Ombudsman unless grave abuse of discretion is shown, per *Dichaves v. Office of the Ombudsman*.
