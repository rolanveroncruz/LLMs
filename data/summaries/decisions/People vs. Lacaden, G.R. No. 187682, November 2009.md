Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Roman Lacaden y Parinas* G.R. No. 187682, November 25, 2009 (620 Phil. 807)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Roman Lacaden y Parinas (Accused-Appellant) for Murder and Attempted Murder.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant was charged with Murder (victim: Danny Valencia) and Attempted Murder (victim: Jay Valencia) stemming from a shooting incident.
*   Prosecution presented evidence that Accused-Appellant ambushed the victims, shooting them with a handgun. Jay survived; Danny died.
*   Defense claimed Accused-Appellant was framed and that his cousin, Pinoy Lacaden, confessed to the crimes. Accused-Appellant presented an alibi, claiming he was at his sister's house, but his sister's testimony was contradictory.

**RTC Decision:**

*   Convicted Accused-Appellant of Murder and Attempted Murder.
*   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for Murder and an indeterminate sentence of six (6) months of *arresto mayor* as minimum to four (4) years of *prision correccional*, as maximum, for Attempted Murder.
*   Ordered to pay damages to the victims' heirs.

**CA Decision:**

*   Affirmed the RTC decision *in toto*.

**Supreme Court (SC) Decision:**

*   Affirmed the CA's decision with modifications.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Positive Identification:** SC upheld the RTC's reliance on the positive identification of Accused-Appellant by eyewitness Jay Valencia.  *People v. Malolot* supported the deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Treachery:** SC agreed that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was present in the Murder charge. The attack was sudden and unexpected, giving the victims no opportunity to defend themselves. *People v. Dela Cruz* and *People v. Bohol* were cited for the definition of treachery. The prior altercation did not negate treachery as there was a considerable lapse of time.
*   **Attempted Murder:** The SC agreed with the crime being attempted murder not frustrated murder, citing the prosecutor not providing a medical witness, but the act was done and intended to kill the victim Jay.
*   **Alibi & Denial:** SC rejected the defenses of alibi and denial, citing their inherent weakness when faced with positive identification. *People v. Torres*. Alibi was further weakened by contradictory testimony from Accused-Appellant's sister.
*   **Damages (Murder):**
    *   Civil indemnity reduced from P75,000 to P50,000.
    *   Temperate damages of P25,000 awarded in lieu of actual damages, since the actual damages proven were less than P25,000.00. Cites *Mahawan v. People*.
    *   Moral damages of P50,000 retained. *People v. Bohol*
    *   Exemplary damages increased to P30,000 due to the presence of treachery. *People v. Gidoc*
*   **Penalty (Attempted Murder):**
    *   SC corrected the indeterminate sentence, imposing a sentence of six (6) years of *prision correccional* as minimum, to ten (10) years of *prision mayor* as maximum. Cites *Rivera v. People*.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Rules of Court (Rule 45)
*   Revised Penal Code:
    *   Article 6 (Attempted Felony)
    *   Article 51 (Penalty to be imposed)
    *   Article 61 (Rules for graduating penalties)
    *   Article 71 (Graduated scales)
    *   Article 248 (Murder)
*   Republic Act No. 7659 (Amendments to the Revised Penal Code)
* Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of death penalty)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case hinged heavily on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. Any evidence suggesting bias or inconsistent testimony by Jay Valencia could weaken the conviction.
*   **Proof of Damages:** While temperate damages were awarded, maximizing the recovery of actual damages requires meticulous documentation and presentation of evidence.

**Conclusion:** The SC affirmed the conviction but adjusted the penalties and damages awarded, providing a more legally precise outcome.
