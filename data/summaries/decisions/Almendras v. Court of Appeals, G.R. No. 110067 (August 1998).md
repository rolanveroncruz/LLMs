## Legal Document Summary: *Ma. Linda T. Almendras vs. Court of Appeals, Urcicio Tan Pang Eng and Fabiana Yap* (G.R. No. 110067, August 03, 1998)

**Nature of the Document:** Resolution on a Motion for Reconsideration concerning a right-of-way easement claim.

**Core Issue:** Determination of the proper route for a legal easement of right-of-way across neighboring estates to provide access to a provincial road for the petitioner's landlocked property.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Remand for Impleader:** The Court *sets aside* the CA and RTC decisions and *remands* the case to the trial court. The key instruction is to *implead* the owners of the "Opone and Tudtud properties" as defendants. The trial court must then hear evidence from all parties to determine the proper location of the easement.
*   **Criteria for Easement Location (Art. 650 Civil Code):** The easement must be established in a location that causes the *least damage* to the servient estate. Shortest distance is a factor, but not if it results in greater damage to the servient estate. The doctrine of *Quimen v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112331, May 29, 1996* is invoked, emphasizing least damage over shortest route if they don't coincide.
*   **Third-Party Complaint Not Required:** While private respondents argued against filing a third-party complaint, the court clarifies that impleader is permissible under Rule 3, §11 ROC ("parties may be dropped or added by order of the court"), negating the need for a third-party complaint under Rule 6, §12 (now §11). The court emphasizes it's impleader so all surrounding owners are properly heard, not necessarily a claim for indemnity or contribution.
*   **Petitioner's Right to a Right-of-Way:** The Court affirms the petitioner's fundamental right to an easement of right-of-way, as her property is surrounded on all sides.
*   **Burden of Proof/Procedure:** Although the private respondents bear the burden of proving that another route is least prejudicial, the court instructs the lower court to implead the owners of the proposed servient estates and let the trial court proceed as normal (all parties present evidence).

**Obligations:**

*   **Trial Court:** Obligated to implead the owners of the Opone and Tudtud properties.
*   **Owners of Opone and Tudtud Properties:** If impleaded, obligated to answer the complaint and present evidence regarding the potential impact of the easement on their properties.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Owners of Servient Estate(s):** Potentially liable to provide an easement across their land. The specific terms of the easement (location, width, compensation) would be determined by the trial court.

**Risks:**

*   **Further Litigation:** The remand necessitates further litigation, potentially prolonging the resolution of the dispute.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** If an easement is established, disputes regarding just compensation for the servient estate may arise.
*   **Enforcement Issues:** Enforcing the terms of the easement after its establishment could also lead to future disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 650 of the Civil Code:** Governs the location of a right-of-way, prioritizing least damage.
*   **Quimen v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112331, May 29, 1996:**  Case precedent emphasizing the "least damage" principle in establishing easements.
*   **Rule 3, §11 of the Rules of Court:**  Allows the court to add or drop parties *motu proprio* (on its own initiative).
*   **Rule 6, §12 (now §11) of the Rules of Court:** Deals with third-party complaints. The court differentiates its application from the impleader process here.
*   **Samala v. Victor, 170 SCRA 453 (1989):** Supports the claim that a party can be impleaded for "any other relief in respect of plaintiff's claim."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "least damage" standard can be highly subjective and fact-dependent, leading to potential disagreements.
*   While the court does not explicitly address *just compensation* for the eventual easement, the fact that this can be a contested area is not addressed.

**Recommendations:**

*   Counsel should prepare evidence to demonstrate the extent of damage that each of the properties is likely to suffer.
*   Counsel should research comparable easements in the area to determine appropriate compensation levels.
*   Focus on presenting a compelling narrative to the trial court.
