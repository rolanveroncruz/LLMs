**Case:** *Philippine Airlines Inc. (PAL) vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), et al.* G.R. No. 114775, September 25, 1998.

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari filed by Philippine Airlines (PAL) challenging the NLRC's decision that affirmed the Labor Arbiter's ruling of illegal dismissal of certain employees initially hired through G.C. Services Enterprises, a manpower agency.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The Court affirmed the NLRC's finding that G.C. Services Enterprises was a "labor-only" contractor. This is based on the fact that G.C. Services lacked substantial capital and the employees performed tasks directly related to PAL's core business, under the supervision of PAL personnel. This determination invokes Articles 106, 107, and 109 of the Labor Code.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** As per Industrial Timber Corporation vs. NLRC, the finding of labor-only contracting established an employer-employee relationship between PAL and the employees supplied by G.C. Services.
*   **Regular Employees:**  Pursuant to Article 280 of the Labor Code, the employees are deemed regular employees of PAL due to the nature of their work and length of service. This entitles them to security of tenure.
*   **Redundancy:** The Labor Arbiter found that PAL regularized 23 other employees hired from the services, which constituted redundancy. Therefore they could not hire any more services from G.C.
*   **Illegal Dismissal (Overturned):** The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's initial ruling that the termination of the private respondents was illegal, even with the finding of redundancy. This was based on a misapplication of Article 282 of the Labor Code, which deals with termination for cause due to employee misconduct. The Supreme Court found that the termination was valid due to redundancy, therefore, overturning the NLRC's ruling on illegal dismissal.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PAL's Joint and Several Liability:** Because G.C. Services was deemed a labor-only contractor, PAL is held jointly and severally liable with G.C. Services for the employees' monetary claims based on Articles 106, 107, and 109 of the Labor Code.
*   **Separation Pay:** Since the termination was due to redundancy (authorized cause under Article 283 of the Labor Code), the Court ordered PAL to pay separation pay to the employees, computed at a rate of one-month pay for every year of service.
*   **No Backwages:** The Court reversed the award of backwages because the termination was deemed valid based on redundancy (Article 283), not an unjust dismissal (Article 279). Backwages are only applicable in cases of unjust dismissal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Misapplication of Legal Articles:** Misapplication of Article 282 and 279 of the Labor Code which ultimately resulted in an illegal assessment by the labor arbiter.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded 5% of the total separation pay.
*   **Joint and Several Liability with G.C. Services:** PAL remains exposed to liability for the employees' claims, even though they contracted with G.C. Services. This highlights the risk of using manpower agencies without properly vetting their compliance with labor laws.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 106, 107, 109, 279, 280, 282, and 283 are the primary statutory references.
*   **Industrial Timber Corporation vs. NLRC:**  Establishes the employer-employee relationship in labor-only contracting scenarios.
*   **Philippine Bank of Communications v. National Labor Relations:** The Supreme Court held both the employer and the "labor only" contractor responsible to the latter’s employees for the more effective safeguarding of the employees’ rights under the Labor Code.
*   **Wiltshire File Co. Inc. v. NLRC**: defined redundancy.
*   **Tabas v. California Manufacturing Co. Inc.:** States that where the liability is imposed, it "must be shouldered by either one or shared by both".
