Okay, here's a markdown summary of the provided legal document, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Ariel A. Ebuenga v. Southfield Agencies, Inc., et al.* (G.R. No. 208396, March 14, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC and Labor Arbiter's dismissal of the seafarer's claim for permanent disability benefits.

**Holding:** Petition DENIED. The Court of Appeals decision is AFFIRMED.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **POEA-SEC, Section 20(B):**  Central issue revolves around compliance with post-employment medical examination requirements within 3 working days of repatriation as mandated by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) sec 20.B. Failure to comply results in forfeiture of disability benefits.
*   **Company-Designated Physician:** The case hinges on whether the seafarer complied with the POEA-SEC requirement to undergo examination by a company-designated physician within 3 days of repatriation.  The court reiterates the reciprocal obligation, the employer has a corresponding implied obligation to conduct a meaningful and timely examination of the seafarer.
*   **Three-Doctor Rule:** If a seafarer's doctor disagrees with the assessment of the company-designated physician, a third doctor is to be jointly agreed upon, and that doctor's decision is final. (Not directly applicable here, as the process was not initiated.)
*   **Work-Relatedness:** The Court also addresses whether the seafarer's disc desiccation was work-related, as required for compensability under the POEA-SEC. The court found that he failed to demonstrate the link between his work conditions and the ailment.

**Obligations:**

*   **Seafarer:** Obligation to report for medical examination within 3 days of repatriation.
*   **Employer:** Reciprocal obligation to conduct a meaningful and timely examination of the seafarer.

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer potentially liable for permanent disability benefits if the illness is work-related and the POEA-SEC requirements are met.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Seafarer's Claim of Refusal:**  The core contention is the seafarer's claim that the employer refused to allow examination by the company-designated physician, which the Court found unsubstantiated. The argument that denial of access to medical examination waives the seafarerâ€™s obligation to undergo the post-employment examination.
*   **Work-Relatedness Standard:** The application of the "work-relatedness" standard, particularly in cases involving degenerative conditions.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar***:  Clarifies the rules and timelines for determining permanent disability under the POEA-SEC. (citing *Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc.* which defines the 120/240-day rule for disability assessment).
*   ***Manota v. Avantgarde Shipping Corporation***: emphasizes the importance of the 3-day mandatory reporting requirement.
*   *Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc., et al. v. Serna* (700 Phil. 1 (2012): Details the reciprocal obligation of both the seafarer to report for medical examination and the employer to act on the report with a meaningful and timely examination.
*   *Tagud v. BSM Crew Service Centre Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 219370, December 6, 2017 (2015) reiterates the twin requirements for compensation of disability

**Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC)
*   Labor Code
*   Rules of Court, Rule 45

**Key Arguments and Findings:**

*   The Court found the seafarer's claim of denial of medical examination unsupported by evidence. The burden of proof in labor cases rests upon the party asserting the affirmative of an issue, and the seafarer failed to provide substantial evidence.
*   The Court highlighted the absence of any specific details regarding the alleged refusal, such as the date, person involved, or reason for refusal.
*   The Court emphasized that the seafarer failed to demonstrate the link between his work as a chief cook and his disc desiccation, considering the brevity of his employment and the nature of the ailment.

**Caveats:**

*   The Court deferred to the consistent factual findings of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and Court of Appeals, limiting its review to questions of law.
*   The decision hinges heavily on the lack of evidence presented by the seafarer to support his claims.
*   The petitioner failed to present documentation like official records, a complaint to the International Transport Workers' Federation, or affidavits from colleagues.
