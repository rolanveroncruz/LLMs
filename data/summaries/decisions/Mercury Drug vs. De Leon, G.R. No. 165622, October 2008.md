**Legal Document Summary: Mercury Drug Corporation and Aurmela Ganzon v. Raul De Leon, G.R. No. 165622, October 17, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari (treated as a petition for certiorari) assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of Mercury Drug's appeal due to procedural lapses.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Factual Background:** Respondent De Leon, a judge, sought medication for an eye irritation at Mercury Drug. Pharmacist assistant Ganzon dispensed "Cortisporin Otic Solution" (ear drops) instead of the prescribed "Cortisporin Opthalmic" (eye drops). This resulted in pain and injury to De Leon's eye. Mercury Drug argued De Leon was contributorily negligent.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of De Leon, awarding damages for pecuniary loss, moral damages (Php 100,000), exemplary damages (Php 300,000), and attorney's fees (Php 50,000).  The RTC found Ganzon negligent in dispensing a prescription drug without properly reviewing the prescription. They cited the presumption of negligence against employers for the actions of their employees.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA dismissed Mercury Drug's appeal based on Section 1(f) of Rule 50 and Section 13 of Rule 44, ROC, finding a lack of page references to the records in the appellant's brief.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court partially granted the petition. While the CA had discretion to dismiss the appeal, it should not have been applied rigidly. The Court found substantial compliance with procedural rules, referencing Exhibits and Transcript of Stenographic Notes (TSN). However, the Court ultimately upheld the finding of negligence against Mercury Drug and Ganzon.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty of Care (Mercury Drug and Ganzon):** Pharmacists have a duty to exercise the *highest degree of care and diligence* when dispensing medications (citing *Tombari v. Conners*, *Fleet v. Hollenkemp*, *Smith's Admrx v. Middelton*, *United States v. Pineda*, and *Mercury Drug Corporation v. Baking*).
*   **Employer Liability:**  Under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, employers are presumed negligent for the acts of their employees. Mercury Drug failed to rebut this presumption.
*   **Damages:** Although negligence was proven, the SC reduced the initial damages, as they were excessive, and instead imposed Moral Damages (Php 50,000.00) and exemplary damages (Php 25,000.00).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 50, Section 1(f) of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Grounds for dismissal of appeal (lack of page references).
*   **Rule 44, Section 13 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Requirements for briefs.
*   **Article 2180 of the Civil Code:** Employer liability for employee negligence.
*   **Articles 2217 and 2229 of the Civil Code:** Moral and exemplary damages.

**Case Law:**

*   **De Liano v. Court of Appeals:** Discusses the consequences of lacking page references in briefs, but distinguished from the present case.
*   **Heirs of Palomique v. Court of Appeals:** Similar to De Liano, distinguished from the present case due to lack of a separate statement of facts and page references.
*   **Yuchengco v. Court of Appeals & De Leon v. CA**: Precedents on substantial compliance with procedural rules regarding briefs.
*   **U.S. v. Pineda**
*   **Mercury Drug Corporation v. Baking** - similar facts and issues and resulted in similar consequences.
*   **Tombari v. Conners, Fleet v. Hollenkemp, Smith's Admrx v. Middelton**: US cases cited to support the standard of care for pharmacists.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was the application of procedural rules regarding the appellant's brief and whether "substantial compliance" had been met. The Court ruled that it had, allowing the appeal on the merits (negligence) to be considered.
*  Mercury Drug arguing that De Leon's failure to read the label was the proximate cause of his injuries was also contentious. The Court rejected this arguing that de Leon relied on Mercury Drug's expertise.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case reinforces the high standard of care expected of pharmacists and the potential liability of both the pharmacist and the employer for dispensing errors. It demonstrates that pharmacy businesses are imbued with public interest and calls for a high level of diligence.
* The case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in appeals, but also acknowledges the possibility of substantial compliance, and therefore highlights the importance of filing appeals.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the legal responsibility of pharmacies and pharmacists to exercise the highest degree of care in dispensing medications. It illustrates that dispensing the wrong medication, even due to a perceived accidental mistake, constitutes negligence and can result in significant liability. Furthermore, while adherence to procedural rules is critical in appeals, courts may consider the existence of substantial compliance and ensure that appeals are not dismissed because of minor and insignificant procedural defects.
