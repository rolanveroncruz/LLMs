**Case Summary: *Okol v. Slimmers World International***

**Facts:** Leslie Okol (Petitioner) was dismissed from Slimmers World (Respondent). She filed a complaint for illegal suspension, illegal dismissal, unpaid commissions, damages, and attorney's fees with the NLRC. Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing Okol was a corporate officer. The Labor Arbiter granted the motion. The NLRC reversed, finding in favor of Okol. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the NLRC, affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision, finding that the issue was an intra-corporate dispute.

**Issue:** Does the NLRC have jurisdiction over the illegal dismissal case, or is it an intra-corporate dispute falling under the jurisdiction of the regular courts?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the NLRC lacks jurisdiction. Okol was a corporate officer, thus the case is an intra-corporate dispute falling under the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Corporate Officer vs. Employee:** The Court applied Section 25 of the Corporation Code and *Tabang v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 121143, 21 January 1997, 266 SCRA 462, 467), distinguishing between officers (created by corporate charter, elected by directors/stockholders) and employees (hired by managing officer). The court relied on Slimmers World's General Information Sheet (GIS), meeting minutes, and amended by-laws submitted to the SEC which indicated Okol was a member of the board of directors, held subscribed share of the capital stock, and an elected officer.
*   **Intra-Corporate Dispute:** Citing *Estrada v. NLRC*, the Court held that a corporate officer's dismissal is a corporate act and an intra-corporate controversy arising between a stockholder and the corporation.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Original and exclusive jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes was previously vested with the SEC under Presidential Decree No. 902-A, Section 5(c). This jurisdiction was transferred to regional trial courts by Republic Act No. 8799, Section 5.2.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   No specific obligations or liabilities were created by the Supreme Court as it ruled on jurisdiction only.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The primary risk involves establishing whether Okol was, in substance, a corporate officer or merely an employee in title only. This requires careful review of her actual duties, powers, and the level of control she exercised.
*   **Remedy in the Proper Forum:** The Court specifically noted that the ruling was "without prejudice to petitioner Leslie Okol's taking recourse to and seeking relief through the appropriate remedy in the proper forum," implying Okol could refile the case in the RTC.
*   **Statutory References:** Corporation Code, PD 902-A, RA 8799

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Tabang v. NLRC*, G.R. No. 121143, 21 January 1997, 266 SCRA 462, 467
*   *Estrada v. NLRC*, G.R. No. 106722, 4 October 1996, 262 SCRA 709

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly stated but the central issue of whether the NLRC or the RTC has jurisdiction depends on whether the Supreme Court agrees with the Labor Arbiter and the CA that Leslie Okol, despite her title as Vice President, was indeed a corporate officer.
