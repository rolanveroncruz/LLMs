Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rafael M. Concepcion v. Court of Appeals and Land Bank of the Philippines* G.R. No. 161844, December 8, 2008.

**Subject Matter:** Mode of appeal from Regional Trial Court (RTC) acting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC) decision regarding just compensation under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 27.

**Facts:** Rafael Concepcion (petitioner) owned agricultural land placed under PD 27. He disputed the just compensation offered by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR). The RTC, acting as a SAC, set a higher compensation. Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) filed an ordinary appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Issue:** Whether the Supreme Court's ruling in *Land Bank of the Phil. v. De Leon* (437 Phil. 347 (2002), 447 Phil. 495 (2003)) regarding the proper mode of appeal from SAC decisions applies retroactively. The *De Leon* case initially held that a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court is the proper mode of appeal, overturning the earlier practice of using an ordinary appeal.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that *Land Bank of the Phil. v. De Leon* applies *prospectively* from March 20, 2003 (date of the Resolution partially granting the motion for reconsideration). Since LBP filed its notice of appeal *before* March 20, 2003, the CA correctly reinstated LBP's ordinary appeal.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **PD 27:** Governs land redistribution and just compensation to landowners.
*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** While not directly discussed, it is the enabling law for land reform.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 42:** Specifies the process for filing a Petition for Review, now the standard for appealing SAC decisions post-March 20, 2003.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **LBP's Potential Liability:** Paying the higher just compensation determined by the RTC if the CA ultimately affirms the RTC decision on the merits of the just compensation amount.
*   **Risk of Procedural Error:** Incorrectly choosing the mode of appeal (ordinary appeal vs. Petition for Review) could lead to dismissal of the appeal. This risk existed during the period before the *De Leon* case was clarified.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 27:** Decreed the emancipation of tenants and provided for just compensation.
*   **RA 6657, Sections 60 and 61:** These sections are mentioned in the *Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Phil.* (486 Phil. 366 (2004)) case, relating to appeals from SACs, but are not quoted directly.
*   ***Land Bank of the Phil. v. De Leon*** (437 Phil. 347 (2002), 447 Phil. 495 (2003)): The core case determining the proper mode of appeal (Rule 42 Petition for Review) and its prospective application.
*   ***Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Phil.*** (486 Phil. 366 (2004)): Reaffirms the prospective application of *De Leon*.
*   ***Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals*** G.R. No. 164195, 6 February 2007, 514 SCRA 537: Reiterates the non-retroactive application of Land Bank of the Phil. v. De Leon
*   ***Land Bank of the Phils. v. Arceo, et al.***, G.R. No. 158270, 21 July 2008: Affirms that a notice of appeal filed before 20 March 2003 may still be given due course.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The central ambiguity revolved around the interpretation of Sections 60 and 61 of RA 6657 regarding the proper mode of appeal from SACs. The conflict in CA decisions prior to *De Leon* fueled the confusion. The *De Leon* case resolved this but created a new issue about retroactivity, which the present case addresses.

**Potential Legal Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument (Failed):** Arguing for the retroactive application of *De Leon*, which would have resulted in the dismissal of LBP's appeal.
*   **LBP's Argument (Successful):** Relying on pre-*De Leon* practice and arguing for the prospective application of the new rule.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, confirming that LBP's ordinary appeal was properly filed because it predated the prospective application of the *De Leon* ruling regarding the mode of appeal from SAC decisions. The crucial point is the date of the *filing of the appeal*, not the date of the SAC decision.
