## Legal Document Summary: Marquez v. Mayo, G.R. No. 218534

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision in *Police Director General Ricardo C. Marquez v. PO2 Arnold P. Mayo*, G.R. No. 218534, addressing the executory nature of a PNP Chief's dismissal order pending appeal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the penalty of dismissal from service imposed on a police officer by the Chief of the PNP is immediately executory even when an appeal has been seasonably filed with the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) National Appellate Board (NAB).

**Holding:** While initially, the RTC correctly ruled that the PNP Chief's dismissal order was not immediately executory pending appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision and dissolved the writ of injunction it issued. This reversal was based on the *supervening event* that the Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) had *subsequently dismissed* PO2 Mayo's appeal, rendering his dismissal executory under Section 47 of Book V, Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Section 45, R.A. 6975 (DILG Act of 1990):**  The Court acknowledged that this section states disciplinary action is "final and executory." However, the existence of appeal processes within the NAPOLCOM framework necessitates a nuanced interpretation that the decisions, even dismissal orders, are not immediately executory if appealed. The court noted that while the final proviso concerns RAB, its existence demonstrates that the decision will not become final and executory when appeal has been filed.
*   **NAPOLCOM Memorandum Circular No. 2007-001 (NMC 2007-001):** Initially in force. This circular outlines procedures for disciplinary actions in the PNP. The Court rejected PNP's contention that only a motion for reconsideration stays execution of the disciplinary action. The Court construed that because the Circular did not foreclose other modes of staying the execution, the fact that disciplinary actions may be appealed to the NAB, meant that they were not immediately executory when an appeal has been seasonably filed with the NAB.
*   **Executory Nature of Dismissal after DILG Secretary's Decision:** The Supreme Court hinged its reversal on the DILG Secretary's dismissal of PO2 Mayo's appeal. Referencing Section 47 of EO 292, the Court stated that this dismissal from service is executory and removed any impediment to reversing the RTC.
*   **Application of Civil Service Laws:** The Court noted that Section 91 of RA 6975 applies the Civil Service Law and its implementing rules and regulations to all personnel of the DILG.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6975 (DILG Act of 1990):** Section 45 crucial for determining finality of disciplinary actions.
*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Section 47 of Book V defines disciplinary jurisdiction and clarifies that in case the decision rendered is appealable to the Commission, the same shall be initially appealed to the department and finally to the Commission and pending appeal, the same shall be executory except when the penalty is removal, in which case the same shall be executory only after confirmation by the Secretary concerned.
*   **National Appellate Board (NAB) of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) v. P/Inp. John A. Mamauag, 504 Phil. 186 (2005):** Clarifies that Section 45 of R.A. No. 6975, as amended, provides that a disciplinary action imposed upon a member of the PNP shall be final and executory, and disciplinary actions are appealable only if it involves either a demotion or dismissal from the service.
*   **Jenny Zacarias v. National Police Commission, 460 Phil. 555 (2003):** Summary dismissals from the service imposed by the Chief of the PNP under Section 42 of R.A. 6975 are immediately executory.
*   **Planters Products, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 375 Phil. 615 (1999):** As a general rule, only judgments which have become final can be executed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   PO2 Mayo's obligation to accept dismissal from the service, based on the confirmed findings of grave misconduct.
*   PNP's obligation to implement the dismissal order after confirmation by the DILG Secretary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Future Challenges based on Procedural Defects:** If PO2 Mayo successfully argues a procedural defect in the DILG Secretary's decision (e.g., lack of due process in the dismissal of the appeal), the issue of the dismissal's executory nature could be revisited.
*   **Interpretation of "Supervening Event":** The Court's reliance on the DILG Secretary's decision as a supervening event could be seen as allowing an administrative decision to circumvent the initial RTC injunction. This may create a precedent for using subsequent rulings to bypass injunctions.
*   **NAPOLCOM M.C. No. 2016-002:** While not directly applicable because of the timing of the case, it repealed NAPOLCOM M.C. 2007-001. Lawyers must keep up with the circular's current interpretation because NAPOLCOM M.C. No. 2016-002 does not expressly provide for immediately executory nature of the decisions of the PNP summary dismissal authorities.

**Concise Summary:**

The SC reversed the RTC's injunction against PO2 Mayo's dismissal. While initially the dismissal was not immediately executory pending appeal, the DILG Secretary's subsequent dismissal of PO2 Mayo's appeal constituted a "supervening event" making the dismissal now executory under EO 292.
