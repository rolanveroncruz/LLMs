**Legal Document Summary: *Social Security System vs. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Company of Manila, Inc. and Semirara Coal Corporation*, G.R. No. 175952, April 30, 2008**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45.  The decision affirms the Court of Appeals' ruling which reversed the trial court's dismissal of a complaint for specific performance filed by AG&P and Semirara against SSS.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dacion en Pago Agreement:** AG&P and Semirara (Respondents) proposed, and SSS (Petitioner) initially approved (Resolution No. 270), a *dacion en pago* arrangement to settle Respondents' outstanding premium and loan amortization delinquencies with a property located in San Pascual, Batangas.
*   **Dispute:** The dispute arises from the *non-implementation* of the agreed *dacion en pago* by SSS, specifically SSS's attempt to increase the amount owed *after* the dacion was approved.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The central legal issue is whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or the Social Security Commission (SSC) has jurisdiction over the case.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents' Initial Obligation:** Respondents were initially obligated to SSS for delinquent premium and loan amortizations. This obligation was intended to be extinguished by the dacion.
*   **SSS's Obligation:** SSS had an obligation to implement the terms of the approved *dacion en pago*, accepting the Batangas property as payment for the agreed-upon amount (P29,261,902.45 as of March 31, 2001).
*   **Potential Liability of SSS:** By failing to implement the dacion and unilaterally increasing the debt amount, SSS potentially breached its obligation and could be held liable for specific performance.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** SSS faces the risk of being found to have breached the *dacion en pago* agreement.
*   **Damages:** AG&P and Semirara sought Damages.
*   **Loss of opportunity to earn interest:**

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 1161 (as amended by RA 8282 - Social Security Act of 1997):** Section 5(a) vests jurisdiction with the SSC for disputes "with respect to coverage, benefits, contributions and penalties thereon or any other matter related thereto." The Court distinguishes this by stating the dispute has moved past mere delinquencies.
*   ***Vda. de Jayme v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128669, 4 October 2002, 390 SCRA 380***: Defines *dacion en pago* and its essential elements (consent, object, cause).  Emphasizes that common consent is essential for extinguishing the debt. This highlights the issue of SSS's subsequent modification of the debt amount.
*   ***Singson v. Isabela Sawmill, No. L-27343, 28 February 1979, 88 SCRA 623***: Outlines how to determine if an action is capable of pecuniary estimation.  Since the primary relief sought is specific performance (not just recovery of a sum of money), jurisdiction lies with the RTC.
* Russell v. Vestil, G.R. No. 119347, 17 March 1999, 304 SCRA 738, 744-745: Action of specific performance is one incapable of pecuniary estimation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The issue of additional interests and penalties:** The court needs to make a decision on who is at fault.
*   **SSS's consent to the *dacion en pago*:** AG&P and Semirara will need to prove consent.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, placing jurisdiction in the RTC for the specific performance case. The main risk for SSS lies in the breach of the *dacion en pago* agreement, especially if the RTC finds that it unilaterally and improperly attempted to increase the debt *after* initially approving the settlement via the *dacion*. The critical element to consider is whether SSS validly consented to the *dacion en pago* at the initially agreed-upon amount.
