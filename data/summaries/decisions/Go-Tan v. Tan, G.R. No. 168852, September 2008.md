## Legal Document Summary: *Go-Tan v. Tan*, G.R. No. 168852 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's dismissal of a petition for a Temporary Protective Order (TPO) against petitioner's parents-in-law under RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004).

**Key Issue:** Whether RA 9262 extends to parents-in-law who allegedly conspired with the petitioner's husband to commit acts of violence against her.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in favor of the petitioner, holding that the principle of conspiracy under Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) may be applied suppletorily to RA 9262, even though the law explicitly defines the offender as someone related to the victim by marriage, former marriage, or dating relationship.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** RA 9262 should be liberally construed (Section 4), and the RPC's provision on conspiracy (Article 8) should be applied suppletorily (Section 47). Steven and his parents conspired to abuse her verbally, psychologically, and economically.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** The express language of RA 9262 limits the offender to specific relationships with the victim. Parents-in-law are not included. The principle of "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" applies.
*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   Section 47 of RA 9262 explicitly allows for suppletory application of the RPC.
    *   Article 10 of the RPC provides that the Code shall be supplementary to such laws, unless the latter should specially provide the contrary.
    *   Section 5 of RA 9262 acknowledges that violence can be committed "through another."
    *   Section 8(a) allows protective orders prohibiting acts committed "personally or through another."
    *   Section 4 mandates liberal construction to protect victims.
    *   Principle of conspiracy is applied when there is community of design and purpose; act of one is the act of all the conspirators, and the precise extent or modality of participation of each of them becomes secondary, since all the conspirators are principals

**Obligations & Liabilities:** The respondents may be held liable as principals in the alleged acts of violence against the petitioner if conspiracy is proven. They may be subject to protective orders under RA 9262.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Determination of Conspiracy:** The Court noted that the presence or absence of conspiracy is an evidentiary matter that needs to be threshed out in a full-blown trial.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner bears the burden of proving the conspiracy and the specific acts constituting violence as defined under RA 9262.
*   **Overreach of RA 9262:** This ruling expands the potential scope of RA 9262, potentially subjecting individuals not explicitly named in the statute to its provisions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9262:** Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (Sections 3, 4, 5, 8, 47)
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 8 (Conspiracy); Article 10 (Offenses not subject to the provisions of this Code).

*   *People v. Li Wai Cheung*, G.R. Nos. 90440-42, October 13, 1992

*   *Ladonga v. People*, G.R. No. 141066, February 17, 2005

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "through another" in Sections 5 and 8 of RA 9262. The extent to which this provision can be stretched to include individuals not explicitly contemplated by the law is a key area of contention.
*   The scope and applicability of suppletory application of RPC provisions.
* The principle of "expressio unius est exclusio alterius".
