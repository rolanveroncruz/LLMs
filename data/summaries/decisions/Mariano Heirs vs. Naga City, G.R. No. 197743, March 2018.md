Okay, here is a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown, focusing on key aspects relevant to a lawyer:

**Case:** *Heirs of Jose Mariano and Helen S. Mariano vs. City of Naga* G.R. No. 197743, March 12, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's Amended Decision, effectively reinstating the MTC's dismissal of an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Issue:**  Who has a better right of *possession* over the subject property (5-hectare land) â€“ the Heirs of Mariano (original landowners) or the City of Naga, given the City's claim of ownership via a 1954 Deed of Donation.  The court emphasizes that this case is regarding possession de facto not possession de jure.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *GRANTS* the petition, sets aside the CA Amended Decision, and reinstates the RTC Decision (with modifications to damages).  The Heirs of Mariano have the better right to possess the property.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Donation:** The City's primary defense rests on a 1954 Deed of Donation.
    *   **Formal Requirements (Article 749, Civil Code):** The SC emphasizes that a donation of immovable property must be in a public document to be valid.
    *   **Defective Acknowledgment:** The purported Deed is *NOT a public document* because the acknowledgment was not made by the donors (Mariano and Gimenez) or the donee (City of Naga), but by officers of the City Heights Subdivision. Mayor Imperial signed the deed 4 days after it was notarized and thus could not have acknowledged it before a notary public on August 16, 1954. Thus, the notary public could not have certified to knowing the parties to the donation.
    *   **Effect of Void Contract:**  Because of the defective notarization, the donation is *void* and of no legal effect. Void contracts cannot be the source of rights.
*   **Best Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Rules of Court):**  While the CA excused the City's failure to present the original Deed of Donation due to loss (certification of the lost notorial reports), the SC notes that even if the copy was admitted, the underlying document itself is void for lack of proper form.
*   **Registered Title (Torrens System):** Title remains with Macario Mariano and Jose Gimenez. The SC stresses the superior probative value of a Torrens title over unregistered claims.  Cases cited: *Spouses Pascual v. Spouses Coronel* and *Co v. Militar*
*   **Open Space Requirement (Subdivision Regulations and P.D. 957/1216):**  The City argued that the land was intended as open space for public use within a subdivision, automatically vesting ownership in the City. The court rejects this, noting the specific requirements for open space that are not buildable. The lots in question were designated as City Hall site and market site, and there was no positive act of conveyance or dedication was necessary to vest ownership in the city or municipality.
    *   The Court relied on *Woodridge School, Inc. v. ARB Construction Co., Inc.,* which stated, "until and unless the roads are donated, ownership remains with the owner-developer."
    *   The Court distinguishes *White Plains Association, Inc. v. Judge Legaspi*, as the ruling there was modified in *White Plains Association v. Court of Appeals*
*   **Eminent Domain/Just Compensation:** The City argued that because of current use, the Heirs' remedy is limited to just compensation, citing *Alfonso v. Pasay City*.  The SC rejects this argument because the property was never expropriated or condemned. No sovereign function was being exercised by the City in taking possession of the subject property, but rather was offered by its owners-developers.
*   **Builder in Good Faith:** The City cannot be considered a builder in good faith because it knew of the flaw in its claim to the property. The donation was contingent on the City awarding the construction contract to the Subdivision. The evidence shows that the city acted in bad faith as a conditional donation did not come to pass.
*   **Laches/Prescription:** The Court finds neither laches nor prescription apply. Macario took steps to address the issue, and later, the Heirs promptly acted after discovering their rights. Furthermore, an action to recover a possession of registered land never prescribes, citing Section 44 of Act No. 496.

**Damages:**
*   *Restitution of the premises*
*   *Reasonable Rent:*  P2.5 million per month, or P50.00/sqm, from November 30, 2003, until the property is vacated (petitioners are to be paid only half of this value as the subject property was co-owned). The court rejected the CA's reduction of the monthly rental.
*   *Attorney's Fees:* Reduced to P75,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Title Action:** The SC explicitly states its ruling only addresses *possession*, not ownership. The City could initiate a separate action for title.
*   **Privies:**  The ruling is binding on the City and its privies (government agencies occupying the property).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 749:**  Donation of immovable property requirements.
*   **Rule 130, Rules of Court** Best evidence rule
*   **Act No. 496, Section 44:**  Imprescriptibility of registered land.
*   **`Woodridge School, Inc. v. ARB Construction Co., Inc.`** until and unless the roads are donated, ownership remains with the owner-developer
*   **Spouses Pascual v. Spouses Coronel** torrens title
*   **Co v. Militar** torrens title
