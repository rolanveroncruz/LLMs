## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. The Honorable Court of Appeals and United Overseas Bank* (G.R. No. 166260, Feb. 18, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari, challenging the CA's affirmation of the RTC's dismissal of a Petition for Review of a PCHC Board Resolution. The underlying dispute involves an altered check.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Altered Check:** Check No. 0801266381 was allegedly altered both in date and amount. Metrobank (drawee bank) cleared the check and subsequently sought reimbursement from UOB (depositary bank).
*   **PCHC Arbitration:** Metrobank filed a complaint with the PCHC Arbitration Committee alleging UOB's failure to exercise due diligence in detecting the alteration.
*   **24-Hour Clearing House Rule:** UOB argued Metrobank violated the 24-hour clearing house rule by initially clearing the check and subsequently refusing to honor it.
*   **Delay in Prosecution:** The PCHC Arbitration Committee dismissed Metrobank's case due to repeated postponements and failure to prosecute.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The central legal issue is the jurisdiction of the RTC to review the PCHC Board Resolution. The PCHC Rules of Procedure for Arbitration (PCHC Rules) purported to grant the RTC this jurisdiction.
*   **Erroneous Procedure:** After the PCHC Board of Directors denied Metrobank's motion for reconsideration, Metrobank filed a Petition for Review with the RTC, following the incorrect advice of the PCHC Executive Secretary.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Drawee Bank Liability (Metrobank):** The RTC ruled that Metrobank, as the drawee bank, should bear the loss for mistakenly clearing an altered check. This is based on the principle that the drawee bank is in the best position to detect alterations.
*   **Depositary Bank's Duty of Diligence (UOB):** Metrobank asserted UOB had a duty to examine the deposited check for material alterations. The court does not rule on this aspect.
*   **Compliance with Clearing House Rules:** Banks are obligated to adhere to the PCHC rules, including the 24-hour clearing rule.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguous PCHC Rules:** The PCHC Rules are a private agreement among member banks and cannot confer jurisdiction on the RTC by themselves.
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:** Metrobank's reliance on the PCHC Rules to file a Petition for Review with the RTC was a fatal procedural error, depriving the RTC of jurisdiction.
*   **Failure to Exhaust Proper Remedies:** Metrobank failed to pursue available judicial remedies like a Motion to Vacate the Arbitral Award or a Petition for Review with the CA under Rule 43 or a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** Although not directly addressed, previous arbitral decisions on similar issues between banks and altered checks could impact future disputes.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Arbitration Law (Section 24):** Provides grounds for vacating an arbitral award, which could have been invoked by Metrobank.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 43):** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 65):** Governs petitions for certiorari to challenge acts of quasi-judicial agencies.
*   ***Insular Savings Bank v. Far East Bank and Trust Company* (G.R. No. 141818, June 22, 2006):**  This case is cited as precedent, holding that the PCHC Rules cannot confer jurisdiction on the RTC to review arbitral awards.
*   **Maharlika Publishing Corporation v. Spouses Tagle, 226 Phil. 456, 463-464 (1986):** This case is cited regarding the Supreme Court's authority to go beyond the pleadings when necessary.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Metrobank's petition, finding that the RTC lacked jurisdiction. The PCHC Rules cannot override the established statutory framework for judicial review. Metrobankâ€™s error in filing a Petition for Review directly with the RTC, instead of pursuing appropriate remedies under the Arbitration Law or Rules of Court, proved fatal to its case. The court does not address the underlying issue of negligence or liability for the altered check, focusing solely on procedural jurisdiction.
