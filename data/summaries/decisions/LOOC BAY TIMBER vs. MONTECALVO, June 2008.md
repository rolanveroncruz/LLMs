## Legal Document Summary: *Looc Bay Timber Industries, Inc. v. Intestate Estates of Victor Montecalvo and Concordia L. Montecalvo* (G.R. No. 174925)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision on a complaint for Specific Performance.

**Key Provisions and Agreements:**

*   **1978 Lease Agreement:** Original lease of Lot No. 4083 by Montecalvo, Sr. to Looc Bay Timber Industries, Inc. (LBTI), which was extended.
*   **November 10, 1983 Agreement:** Agreement for LBTI to purchase a 13,410 sq. m. portion of Lot No. 4083 for P335,250, with P203,000 previously paid. RTC ordered execution of deed of sale contingent on full payment, which CA found to be satisfied.
*   **November 28, 1984 Agreement:** Agreement between Montecalvo, Sr. and Visayan Forest Development Corporation (VFDC), sister company of LBTI, for the sale of portions of land adjoining LBTI's logging road at P12.50/sq. m. The CA declared this agreement void.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Montecalvo Estates:** Obligation to execute a deed of conveyance for the land covered by the November 10, 1983 Agreement, contingent on full payment of consideration by Looc Bay Timber Industries, Inc., as per RTC ruling (affirmed with modification by CA).
*   **LBTI/VFDC:** Potential liability for outstanding balance on November 10, 1983 agreement, although CA found that this agreement had been satisfied. No liability arises from the Nov 28, 1984 agreement as it was nullified.

**Liabilities**

*   No pronouncement as to damages and counterclaims, both parties having failed to prove their claims.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of November 28, 1984 Agreement:** The core issue is the validity of this agreement. The CA correctly ruled that the lack of signature from the vendee, VFDC, represented by Valeriano Bueno, indicates a lack of consent, an essential requisite for contract validity under Art. 1318 of the Civil Code.
*   **Payment for November 28, 1984 Agreement:** Although LBTI/VFDC claimed substantial payments for the land subject to this agreement, receipts did not specify the land to which the payments were allocated, weakening their claim. Evidence presented by LBTI did not provide specifics to allow validation.
*   **Affidavit of Quitclaim:** An affidavit of quitclaim was deemed irrelevant because it did not specifically refer to the land of the invalid contract.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1318 of the Civil Code:** Essential requisites for a contract (consent, object, cause).
*   Cited jurisprudence on the weight given to factual findings of trial courts (People v. Fajardo, Jr. etc.) is relevant to the standard of review applied by the CA.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of specificity in payment receipts regarding the land subject to the November 28, 1984 agreement is contentious. The CA highlighted this lack of specificity as a reason for nullifying the agreement.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court denied LBTI's petition, effectively upholding the CA's decision. LBTI will secure the deed of conveyance for the land in the November 10, 1983 agreement, and the court agreed with the CA on their rejection of the November 28, 1984 agreement between Montecalvo and VFDC due to lack of consent. The absence of the vendee's signature and the non-specific payment receipts were critical factors in the ruling. The client should be advised that further appeal is unlikely to succeed given the factual findings of the lower courts regarding the absence of consent for the second agreement.
