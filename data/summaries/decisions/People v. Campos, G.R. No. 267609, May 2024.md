**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Wilfreda Laput Campos a.k.a. "Freda"* G.R. No. 267609, May 27, 2024.

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for qualified trafficking of persons under Sections 4(a) & (e) in relation to Sections 6(a) & (c) of RA 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003), as amended by RA 10364 (Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Violation:** Accused, owner of "Freda's KTV Bar," allegedly obtained, harbored, hired, maintained, and/or provided AAA, BBB, and CCC (a minor) for prostitution and sexual exploitation through fraud, deception, and taking advantage of their vulnerability. Charge is qualified due to the minor victim and large scale (3 or more victims).
*   **Elements of Trafficking (Sec. 3(a), RA 9208 as amended):**
    *   Acts: Recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons.
    *   Means: Threat, use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power, taking advantage of vulnerability, payments/benefits for control.
    *   Purpose: Exploitation, prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, servitude, organ removal/sale.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances (Sec. 6, RA 9208):**  Crime committed against a child and in large scale (against three or more persons).

**Evidence & Findings:**

*   **Prosecution Witnesses:** NBI Agent Villordon (entrapment), AAA, BBB, and CCC (victims).
*   **Entrapment Operation:** Undercover operation where Campos allegedly offered girls for sexual services for a "bar fine" of PHP 2,000.00 per girl. Marked money was used and recovered.
*   **Victim Testimony:** Victims confirmed Campos's ownership, recruitment due to financial difficulty, and understanding that "taking out" involved sexual services.
*   **Defense:** Campos denied offering girls for sex and claimed AAA and her daughter (DDD) managed the bar. She admitted to receiving money but claimed it was for DDD. She was arrested in a police raid
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of qualified trafficking. Actual sexual intercourse not required, solicitation and payment sufficient.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC. All elements of qualified trafficking proven. Relied heavily on Agent Villordon's testimony corroborated by victims. Ignorance of minor's age is inconsequential to qualification.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed CA

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Wilfreda Laput Campos):** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00. Ordered to pay each victim PHP 500,000.00 in moral damages and PHP 100,000.00 in exemplary damages, with 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Agent Villordon's Testimony:** While corroborated, the case hinges heavily on the agent's account of the entrapment. Credibility issues could be raised, although seemingly addressed by concurrent findings of fact by lower courts.
*   **Definition of "Exploitation" and "Purpose":** The law's broad definition of exploitation and the required *purpose* are crucial. Defense may argue the prosecution failed to definitively prove the intended sexual exploitation beyond a reasonable doubt. However, *Ferrer v. People* clarifies that actual prostitution is not required.
*   **Lack of Appellee's Brief in CA:** The OSG waived filing a brief in the Court of Appeals, potentially weakening the prosecution's argument at that stage, although the CA ultimately affirmed the conviction.
*   **SC Ruling:** SC removed "without eligibility of parole" as it is already understood.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The accused-appellant argued that she was unaware of the minor's status. However, this argument was not accepted, given that the minority status of the victim qualifies the crime.
