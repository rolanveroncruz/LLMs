## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Espina* (G.R. No. 213500)

**Document Type:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court resolves PS/SUPT. Rainier A. Espina's Motion for Reconsideration of its prior decision finding him guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and dismissing him from service. The case revolves around Espina's signing of Inspection Report Forms (IRFs) for "ghost deliveries" while Acting Chief and Head of the PNP Management Division.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Finding of Guilt:** The Court reaffirms Espina's negligence in signing IRFs without ensuring the actual delivery of goods and performance of services. The Court rejected Espina's argument that he had no duty to inspect the documents when the IRFs did not bear any irregularities on their face, asserting he had a duty to exercise due diligence.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court acknowledges Espina's mitigating circumstances: first offense, length of service (29 years), and numerous awards/commendations.
*   **Penalty Reduction:**  Based on Section 48, Rule X of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), the Court *modifies* the penalty from dismissal to a one-year suspension without pay. The Court, citing *Office of the Court Administrator v. Egipto, Jr.* and *Fact-finding and Intelligence Bureau v. Campaña*, referenced instances where similar mitigating circumstances resulted in reduced penalties. *Civil Service Commission v. Belagan* was also cited for imposing a one year suspension despite a charge for a grave offense due to numerous awards.
*   **Preventive Suspension Credit:** The period of Espina's preventive suspension prior to the decision is credited towards the one-year suspension.
*   **Reinstatement:** Espina is ordered reinstated to his former rank (Police Senior Superintendent) without loss of seniority rights.
*   **No Back Salaries:** Espina is not entitled to back salaries because he was found culpable of an offense, even though the penalty was reduced on appeal, citing precedent that only complete exoneration or conviction of a lesser offense warrants back salaries.
* **Statutory reference**: Section 47, Chapter 7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of Executive Order No. 292 or the "ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF 1987" and Section 7, Rule III of Ombudsman Administrative Order No. 07 or the "RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE OMBUDSMAN," Approved on April 10, 1990 as amended by Office of the Ombudsman Administrative Order No. 17-03.

**Obligations:**

*   Espina is obligated to serve a one-year suspension without pay.

**Liabilities:**

*   Espina remains liable for Gross Neglect of Duty, even with the reduced penalty.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Due Diligence":** The extent of "due diligence" expected of supervisory officers in verifying documents remains open to interpretation, potentially leading to future disputes.
*   **Discretion in Penalty Reduction:** While the RRACCS provides for consideration of mitigating circumstances, the extent to which they are applied is discretionary, creating potential for inconsistent application across similar cases. The court's reliance on jurisprudence shows similar cases where the decision was to reduce the penalty.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Egipto, Jr.*
*   *Fact-finding and Intelligence Bureau v. Campaña*
*   *Civil Service Commission v. Belagan*
*   *Cabauatan v. Uvero*
*   *Buntag v. Paña*
*   *De Guzman, Jr. v. Mendoza*
*   *Ombudsman v. Delos Reyes*
*   *CSC v. Cruz*
*   *Yamson v. Castro*

**Conclusion:** The Court mitigates the initial penalty of dismissal for Espina to a one year suspension without pay due to his length of service, good record and that it was a first time offense. Espina will be reinstated without backpay.
