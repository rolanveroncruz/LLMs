## Legal Document Summary - People v. Tormis, G.R. No. 183456

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision reviewing a Court of Appeals Decision affirming a Regional Trial Court Joint Decision.

**Subject Matter:** Two counts of qualified rape (statutory rape with aggravating circumstance of parent-child relationship).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellant Regino Tormis was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of qualified rape against his daughter, AAA, under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659) for the first count (Sept 20, 1997) and Articles 266-A and B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997) for the second count (December 25, 1997).
*   **Penalty:** The death penalty initially imposed was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count, due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil indemnity of P150,000 (P75,000 per count)
    *   Moral damages increased to P75,000 per count
    *   Exemplary damages of P25,000 per count

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused's Liability:** Regino Tormis is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for each count of qualified rape and is liable for the specified damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The appellant challenged the credibility of the victim, citing minor inconsistencies between her affidavit and testimony, and the absence of physical scars. The court dismissed these arguments, relying on the trial court's assessment of the witness's demeanor and the corroborating medical evidence. The standard applied is that when a rape victim asserts the crime has been committed and the credibility is sound, that is sufficient to convict the accused.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mateo:** The records were remanded to the Court of Appeals because the original transmission of this case was transmitted to the Supreme Court for automatic review.
*   **People v. Dizon:** Principles of reviewing rape cases, emphasizing the credibility of the complainant's testimony.
*   **People v. Ancheta:** This and other case law (People v. Luceriano, People v. Muros, People v. Sambrano and others) that support the evaluation of testimony, the medical findings, credibility when a minor is the plaintiff, and awards for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in rape cases.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 335:** Rape definition and penalties (as amended by RA 7659).
*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 266-A and 266-B:** Rape definition and penalties (as amended by RA 8353).
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amendments to the Revised Penal Code, including rape provisions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of the appellant for two counts of qualified rape. The court emphasized the credibility of the victim's testimony, corroborated by medical evidence. While minor inconsistencies existed in the testimony, the same did not outweigh the credible case presented by the prosecution.
