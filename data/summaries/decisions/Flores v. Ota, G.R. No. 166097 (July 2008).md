**Case:** *Board of Medicine vs. Yasuyuki Ota*, G.R. No. 166097, July 14, 2008 (580 Phil. 213)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Japanese national, Yasuyuki Ota, who sought to obtain a medical license in the Philippines after graduating from a Philippine medical school and passing the medical board examinations.  The Board of Medicine (Board) denied his application, arguing that reciprocity in the practice of medicine did not exist between Japan and the Philippines. The RTC and CA ruled in favor of Ota, ordering the Board to issue the license. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 9, R.A. No. 2382 (The Medical Act of 1959):**  Foreign citizens are eligible for medical board examinations if they submit competent evidence, confirmed by the DFA, showing that their country's laws permit Filipino citizens to practice medicine under the same rules.
*   **Section (j), P.D. No. 223:**  The PRC can approve the registration and issue certificates to foreigners registered in their own country, provided their country's requirements are substantially the same as the Philippines' and their laws allow Filipinos to practice on the same basis, evidenced by DFA-confirmed documents. The PRC can also prescribe additional requirements.
*   **Articles 2 and 11, Medical Practitioners Law of Japan:** Outline the requirements to become a medical practitioner in Japan, including passing the national exam and holding a license from the Minister of Health and Welfare. Includes provisions allowing those who graduated from a foreign medical school or acquired a medical practitioner license in a foreign country, and also are recognized to have the same or more academic ability and techniques as persons who finished regular medical courses at a university based on the School Education Laws (December 26, 1947) and graduated from said university, or persons who passed the preparatory test for the National Medical Examination and practiced clinics and public sanitation more than one year after passing the said test.
*   **Board's Obligation (Section 20, Medical Act of 1959):**  "Shall" issue certificates of registration to those who have satisfactorily complied with the requirements.  The SC clarifies this is a command when requirements are met.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Board's Liability for Arbitrary Denial:** The Board risks being compelled by *mandamus* if it arbitrarily denies a license to an applicant who meets all statutory requirements for reciprocity.
*   **Risk of Unduly Expanding Requirements:** The Board cannot create requirements beyond those specified in R.A. 2382 and P.D. 223 (i.e., proving a Filipino has *already* practiced in Japan).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Professional Regulation Commission v. De Guzman*, G.R. No. 144681 (2004):**  Distinguished. While generally the PRC's power is discretionary, in this case, the SC found that the *De Guzman* case, which involved doubts regarding the validity of test results, was factually distinct.  *De Guzman* affirmed that "shall" in Section 20 of the Medical Act of 1959 is a command to issue licenses when requirements are met.
*   **Tablarin v. Gutierrez, G.R. No. L-78164, July 31, 1987:**  Affirmed the state's power to regulate medicine, but emphasized that it must not be done arbitrarily.
*   **Reyes v. Sisters of Mercy Hospital, 396 Phil. 87 (2000):**  A license to practice medicine is a privilege granted by the government, earned through education and training, and requires licensure.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 2382 (The Medical Act of 1959)
*   Presidential Decree No. 223 (Creating the Professional Regulation Commission)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Interpretation of "Reciprocity":** The Board argued that "reciprocity" requires proof that the conditions for practice in Japan are practically attainable by Filipinos and that a Filipino has already practiced there.  The SC rejected this interpretation, holding that it is sufficient to show Japanese law *permits* Filipinos to practice under similar rules, as evidenced by DFA-authenticated documents.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Board argued that Ota didn't adequately clarify certain aspects of Japanese law (School Educations Laws, criteria of the Minister of Health, requirements to take the preparatory exam). The SC found that the publication showing foreigners practicing in Japan and Consul General Yabes' letter stating that Japan allows foreigners who meet the local requirements were sufficient proof that reciprocity exists.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, holding that Yasuyuki Ota had sufficiently demonstrated that reciprocity existed between the Philippines and Japan regarding the practice of medicine. The Board was, therefore, compelled to issue his medical license. The ruling clarifies that a strict, overly burdensome interpretation of reciprocity is not required; it is enough that the foreign country's laws permit Filipinos to practice under similar regulations, as confirmed by the DFA. The ruling emphasizes that the power to regulate must be exercised reasonably, and cannot impose requirements beyond those provided by law.
