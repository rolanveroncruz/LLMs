**Case Summary: *Claude P. Bautista vs. Auto Plus Traders, Inc.*, G.R. No. 166405**

**Key Issue:** Whether Claude P. Bautista, as president of Cruiser Bus Lines and Transport Corporation, is personally and civilly liable for the value of two dishonored checks issued to Auto Plus Traders, Inc. for the purchase of spare parts.

**Facts:**

*   Bautista issued two postdated checks to Auto Plus Traders, Inc. One check (P151,200) drawn against his personal account, and another (P97,500) drawn against the corporation's account.
*   Both checks were dishonored due to insufficient funds, leading to BP Blg. 22 charges against Bautista.
*   MTCC initially granted Bautista's demurrer to evidence, but ordered the corporation to pay the value of the checks. RTC modified the order to direct Bautista to pay the value of the checks, filing fees, and costs of litigation.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's ruling.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding Bautista *not* personally liable. The Court's reasoning hinged on the principle of separate juridical personality:

*   Corporations have distinct personalities from their officers and stockholders.
*   Officers are generally not personally liable for corporate obligations unless the corporate veil is used for fraud or illegality, which was not established here.
*   The debts were corporate debts, with no agreement that Bautista would be personally liable.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law):** The law penalizes issuing checks without sufficient funds. The court found that despite the criminal charges, Bautista was not personally liable for the civil aspect of the dishonored checks, as they represented corporate debt.
*   **Section 1 of B.P. Blg. 22:** The dissenting opinion cited Section 1, arguing it suggests the signatory to a corporate check should be held liable. Llamado v. Court of Appeals and Lee v. Court of Appeals are cited as jurisprudence holding signatories civilly liable.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 29 (Accommodation Party):** Auto Plus Traders argued Bautista was an accommodation party, but the Court rejected this, finding insufficient evidence that Bautista intended to lend his name to the corporation. The court emphasized that the elements for accommodation party status must be proven, particularly the intent to lend his name or credit.
*   **Doctrine of Separate Juridical Personality (NCC, Art. 44):** The Court strongly reiterated this principle. Citing Construction & Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Cuenca, and Jardine Davies, Inc. v. JRB Realty, Inc., the court underscored that officers are shielded from corporate liability unless fraud or injustice is proven.
*   **Multiplicity of Suits:** The Dissent argued that requiring a separate civil action against the corporation would lead to unnecessary suits and further burden the offended party.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Civil Action Against the Corporation:** Auto Plus Traders is left with the burden of initiating a separate civil action against Cruiser Bus Lines and Transport Corporation to recover the debt.
*   **Factual Discrepancy:** The disagreement between the MTCC and RTC regarding whether one check was personal introduced complexity. While the Supreme Court resolved this based on documentary evidence, such factual disputes can weaken a party's position.
*   **Dissenting Opinion:** The strong dissent highlights a potential area of contention. While the majority emphasized corporate separateness, the dissent argued for signatory liability under BP Blg. 22, pointing to existing case law. This could be relevant in future cases with similar fact patterns.

**Case Law:**

*   **Llamado v. Court of Appeals:** Cited by the dissent for the proposition that Section 1 of BP Blg. 22 makes the signatory of a corporate check liable.
*   **Lee v. Court of Appeals:** Cited by the dissent as example of a signatory liable for the amount of the bounced check despite that it covered a corporate debt.
*   **Construction & Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Cuenca:** Relevant to the principle of separate juridical personality.
*   **Jardine Davies, Inc. v. JRB Realty, Inc.:** Relevant to the principle of separate juridical personality.
*   **Ang v. Associated Bank, Lim v. Saban, Crisologo-Jose v. Court of Appeals:** Cited by the court as the basis for the elements of an accommodation party.
