Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Bayani M. Alonte v. Hon. Maximo A. Savellano Jr.*, G.R. No. 131652 and *Buenaventura Concepcion v. Judge Maximo Savellano Jr.*, G.R. No. 131728:

**Case Summary: *Alonte v. Savellano*, 350 Phil. 700 (1998)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus, bail, and recusation, challenging the RTC decision finding petitioners guilty of rape under Article 335(2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Rape Charge:** Information filed against Alonte (Mayor) and Concepcion based on Juvie-lyn Punongbayan's complaint. Concepcion charged as an accomplice for bringing the complainant to Alonte.
*   **Change of Venue:** Initially sought due to alleged threats and intimidation; granted from Laguna to Manila based on concerns about coercion/corruption.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Juvie-lyn executed an affidavit of desistance citing personal reasons (disruption to life, etc.), but did not recant the rape allegation.  The prosecution expressed concern as the affidavit may have been influenced by illicit or undue pressure.
*   **Alleged Bribe:** There were documented allegations that bribe money had been offered.
*   **Trial Court Proceedings:** Conflicting accounts on whether a full trial occurred.  Prosecution presented Juvie-lyn and others to affirm voluntariness of desistance; then moved to dismiss. The respondent judge did not call Atty. Balbin to attest her affidavits, which resulted in the same being considered hearsay. Alonte's motion for bail was ignored.
*   **Conviction:** RTC convicted both defendants *in absentia* based on evidence presented and its assessment that the desistance was not voluntary.
*   **Main Issue:**  Whether or not the affidavit of desistance is valid.

**Legal Analysis & Holding:**

*   **Due Process Violation:** The Supreme Court held that the RTC violated the petitioners' right to due process, particularly the right to a fair trial and to be heard. The order of trial prescribed in Rule 119 of the Rules of Court was not followed.  The court said a full and a complete opportunity to defend themselves must have been given to the accused.
*   **Waiver of Rights:** The Court emphasized that the waiver of such rights, particularly the right to cross-examine, must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary – which was not clearly demonstrated. *Brady v. United States*, 397 U.S. 742 (1970) and *Aetna Insurance Co. v. Kennedy*, 301 U.S. 389 (1937) cited.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance Effect:** The Supreme Court ruled the affidavit of desistance, filed *after* the criminal action was instituted, did *not* warrant dismissal of the case. The complainant also did not formally state that she was never raped, but merely that she wishes to stop and live elsewhere with her family.
*   **Pardon in Private Crimes:**  The court clarifies that a pardon may be available to private crimes, only when the same has been done prior to the institution of the criminal action. Cites *People v. Junio*, *People v. Ballabare*, *People v. Miranda*, *People v. Infante*.  However, the pardon did not materialize, since there has been no express pronouncement of the same from the complainant.
*   **Recusation:** The Supreme Court directed Judge Savellano to recuse himself from the case given the potential for animosity and the need for impartiality citing *Luque v. Kayanan*.
*   **Prosecutorial Duty:** The Court reminded prosecutors to discharge their duties with excellence, professionalism, and devotion.

**Disposition:**

*   RTC decision nullified and set aside due to failure of due process.
*   Case remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.
*   Judge Savellano enjoined from further hearing the case; ordered reassignment via raffle.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fact Finding on Desistance:** The Court's strong language regarding potential "illicit influence" on the desistance raises a risk of prejudice on remand, despite disclaimers. The court has already pointed out to bribery money changing hands.
*   **Lack of Clear Remand Instructions:** The Supreme Court’s description of the remand proceedings is somewhat general, potentially leading to further procedural disputes in the trial court.
*   **Weight of Complainant’s Initial Statements:**  The affirmation by the complainant of her October 31, 1996 Reply Affidavit may prejudice the case in the trial court.
