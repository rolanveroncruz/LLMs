**Case Summary: Flores v. Lofranco, A.M. No. P-04-1914**

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against Myrna S. Lofranco, Clerk III, RTC, for Immorality, Misconduct, and Violation of R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Immorality:** Alleged illicit cohabitation with Sabino Flores while married to Venanie Lofranco, Jr. Evidence includes an Affidavit of Sabino's son (later recanted), a barangay blotter (disputed), and a "Kasabutan" (explained away as a misunderstanding).
*   **Misconduct:** Destruction of a fence, taking photographs with armed individuals, and threats related to a land dispute.
*   **Violation of R.A. No. 6713:** Stemming from the alleged immoral behavior and abuse of position (implied).
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denies amorous relationship, claims a business relationship with Sabino, alleges complainants' harassment, and asserts that complainants are the aggressors in the land dispute.

**Decision:** Complaint dismissed.

**Key Legal Issues & Rationale:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Complainants failed to meet the burden of proving allegations with substantial evidence, as required in administrative cases. (*Re: Dishonesty and/or Falsification of Official Document of Mr. Rogelio M. Valdezco, Jr.*, A.M. No. 2005-22-SC).
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The Affidavit of Sabino's son, Jestoni Flores, was deemed inadmissible hearsay because the affiant was not presented to testify. (*Atty. Osias v. CA*; *People's Bank and Trust Company v. Leonidas*). The Court emphasizes that affidavits are generally inadmissible if the affiant isn't presented for cross examination.
*   **Affidavit of Recantation:** Jestoni's subsequent recantation further weakens the initial affidavit's evidentiary value.
*   **Lack of Corroboration:**  The remaining evidence was insufficient to corroborate the claims of immorality and misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Recantation as Evidence:**  The reliance on the recanted affidavit, while understandable in light of the complainants' failure to appear, highlights the inherent weakness of such evidence.  The court should assess the credibility of the recantation with extreme scrutiny.
*   **Land Dispute Complications:** While the administrative case was dismissed, the underlying land dispute could give rise to other legal actions (e.g., civil case for property rights). The court made mention of the fact that the charges which the respondant filed, was in fact against the complainats.
*   **Typographical Error Defense:** The respondent claims it was a typographical error on the part of the desk officer taking down the report.
*   **Reprimand History:** The fact that respondent had been previously reprimanded for discourtesy raises a flag, although it was not given much weight in this particular case.
