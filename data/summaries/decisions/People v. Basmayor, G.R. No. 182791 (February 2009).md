**Case Summary: People v. Basmayor, G.R. No. 182791 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modifications the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Elister Basmayor for Qualified Rape. The RTC dismissed one count of Statutory Rape (Crim. Case No. 122127-H) but convicted him of Statutory Rape in Crim. Case No. 122128-H. The CA affirmed the conviction, finding the accused guilty of Qualified Rape and increasing damages.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant was charged with two counts of Statutory Rape under RA 7610 and Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) based on alleged incidents on November 9 and 12, 2001, against AAA, an 11-year-old, the daughter of his live-in partner.
*   **Testimony:** AAA testified to being raped on both dates. The prosecution presented medical evidence (Medico-Legal Report No. M-2980-01) of fresh hymenal lacerations consistent with recent loss of virginity, possibly from the November 12 incident. The accused denied the allegations, claiming alibi.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted of simple rape for the November 12 incident (Crim. Case No. 122128-H) due to doubts about the November 9 incident and failure to prove he was the common-law spouse of the victim's mother dismissing Criminal Case No. 122127-H. Civil indemnity and moral damages of P50,000 each were awarded.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction but found appellant guilty of Qualified Rape, based on the minority of the victim and her relationship to him as the live-in partner of her mother. Damages were increased to P75,000 each for civil indemnity and moral damages, plus P25,000 in exemplary damages. The death penalty was reduced to Reclusion Perpetua.
*  **Accused Argument:** The testimony of AAA was conflicting and should have been rejected.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Obligation:** To refrain from committing acts constituting rape, especially against minors within his household.
*   **Appellant's Liability:** Found liable for Qualified Rape, sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua, and ordered to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Appellant challenged the victim's credibility due to discrepancies in her testimony about the first alleged rape. The Supreme Court acknowledged the standard of scrutinizing rape victims' testimony but found her testimony about the second incident to be credible and consistent with medical evidence.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The primary dispute centers around the qualifying circumstance of relationship. The appellant claimed the prosecution failed to prove that he was the live-in partner of AAA's mother. The CA and SC disagreed, finding the evidence sufficient even though the appellant gave a different name for his partner.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The defense raised the issue of reasonable doubt, arguing the prosecution failed to prove guilt. The SC, in upholding the CA decision, emphasized the victim's positive identification of the appellant and the corroborating medical evidence.
*   **Parole Ineligibility:** Due to the penalty being Reclusion Perpetua for a crime that would otherwise be punishable by death, the appellant is ineligible for parole under RA 9346.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)**: Forms the basis for protecting the victim in cases of child abuse.
*   **Articles 266-A & 266-B, RPC (Revised Penal Code)**: Define the crime of Rape and the aggravating/qualifying circumstances. *Art. 266-A* defines the circumstances under which the crime of Rape is commited while *Art. 266-B* provides the penalties for the crime.
*   **RA 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997)**: Law in effect when the crime was committed.
*   **RA 9346 (Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty)**: Prohibits the death penalty and results in a Reclusion Perpetua sentence, but without parole eligibility.
*   **People v. Cabalquinto (G.R. No. 167693, 2006)**: Sets the precedent for protecting the identity of victims-survivors of sexual violence by withholding their real names.
*   **Case Law on Rape Testimony:** Principles requiring careful scrutiny of rape accusations, but giving credence to the testimonies of young and immature victims when consistent and supported by other evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, affirming the conviction of Elister Basmayor for Qualified Rape. The decision relies heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony, supported by medical evidence, and clarifies the application of qualifying circumstances and penalties under relevant statutes. The key risk for the appellant is the finality of the conviction and the significant penalties, including imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Court emphasized the absence of any improper motive on the part of the victim and gave weight to her testimony.
