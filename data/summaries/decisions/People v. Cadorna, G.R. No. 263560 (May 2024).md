## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Cadorna*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Ferdinand Cadorna y Decembriano alias "Maco,"* G.R. No. 263560, May 27, 2024

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (affirming Court of Appeals)

**Issue:** Whether Accused-Appellant Cadorna is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder.

**Holding:** Affirmed CA decision finding Cadorna guilty of Murder.

**Facts:** Cadorna was charged with Murder in relation to Section 10 of RA 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) for the death of a 9-year-old victim (AAA). Circumstantial evidence included: Cadorna confronting the victim's father regarding a missing hammer, Cadorna being seen rushing out of the victim's house, a witness finding the victim strangled inside the house shortly thereafter, Cadorna being seen exiting the victim's property, and Cadorna making an inculpatory statement to a classmate of AAA. Cadorna did not testify. The RTC convicted Cadorna of Homicide in relation to RA 7610. The CA modified the decision, finding Cadorna guilty of Murder.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 7610, Section 10:** Penalizes acts of abuse, exploitation, and discrimination against children. Relevant here because victim was under 12.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 248:** Defines and penalizes murder; CA finds that that the killing was attended by the qualifying aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Cadorna is found guilty of murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Cadorna is ordered to pay the heirs of AAA:
    *   Php 75,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   Php 75,000.00 as moral damages
    *   Php 75,000.00 as exemplary damages
    *   Php 50,000.00 as temperate damages
    *   All with 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** SC reiterated that direct evidence is not required for conviction. The circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution created an unbroken chain, excluding all others, pointing to Cadorna as the perpetrator. *People v. Pentecostes*, 820 Phil. 823 (2017), cited for the requisites of conviction based on circumstantial evidence.
*   **Failure to Testify:** SC noted Cadorna's failure to testify and controvert evidence against him, undermining his alibi defence. This was taken negatively against him. *People v. Beriber*, 693 Phil. 629, 644 (2012), cited regarding the inference from an accused's silence.
*   **Superior Strength:** SC upheld the CA's finding that the killing was qualified by taking advantage of superior strength due to the victim's age (9 years old). The court referenced multiple cases where an adult attacking a child constitutes superior strength, thus qualifying the killing as murder. *People v. Pilen*, G.R. No. 254875, February 13, 2023, and *People v. Haloc*, 839 Phil. 1042 (2018) cited.
*   The Court finds that Cadorna was in a position of superior and notorious advantage in the execution of the crime.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The conviction is based solely on circumstantial evidence. While deemed sufficient by the courts, the absence of direct evidence may present opportunities for challenge, particularly concerning the chain of custody of evidence, and the interpretation of witness testimonies.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance of Dwelling:**  The SC did not appreciate the aggravating circumstance of dwelling because the prosecution was unable to prove the lack of provocation on the part of AAA.
*   **Applicability of RA 7610:** While the Information cited RA 7610, the penalty was applied under Article 248 of the RPC (murder). The CA decision clarifies that the crime falls under the RPC as qualified by superior strength, with RA 7610 being relevant due to the victim's age but not the source of the penalty.

*   **People v. Mat-an, 826 Phil. 512 (2018)**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision finding Cadorna guilty of murder. The decision rests heavily on the circumstantial evidence and the application of the doctrine regarding superior strength when the victim is a minor. The absence of Cadorna's testimony and the upholding of superior strength as a qualifying circumstance are crucial factors in the conviction. Any appeal would need to focus on challenging the interpretation of the circumstantial evidence, the application of the superior strength doctrine, or issues related to procedural due process.
