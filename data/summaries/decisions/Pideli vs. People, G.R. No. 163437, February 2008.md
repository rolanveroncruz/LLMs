**Case Summary: *Pideli v. People*, G.R. No. 163437 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for theft.

**Key Issue:** Whether the act of the petitioner constitutes theft or estafa.

**Facts:**

*   Placido Cancio and Wilson Pideli entered into a verbal partnership to subcontract a construction project.
*   Petitioner Ernesto Pideli, Wilson's brother, facilitated the use of his credit line at a hardware store (MTFSH) for the project.
*   After project completion, the partners received payment from the contractor.
*   Placido and Wilson entrusted the full amount to the petitioner with instructions to pay MTFSH and deliver the remaining balance to them, including Placido's P65,000 share.
*   The petitioner allegedly claimed no funds were left after paying MTFSH and refused to remit Placido's share.
*   Placido filed a theft complaint.

**RTC/CA Holdings:**

*   Both courts convicted the petitioner of theft.
*   The RTC sentenced him to 4 years *prision correccional* (medium) to 12 years *prision mayor* (maximum) and ordered reimbursement of P49,500 with interest.
*   Courts found that there was an element of unlawful taking of personal property belonging to another with intent to gain.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 308, Revised Penal Code (Theft):** Defines theft and its elements, which include taking of personal property, belonging to another, with intent to gain, without consent, and without violence or intimidation.
*   **Ownership:** The petitioner contested that the money was partnership property and not solely owned by Placido. The CA found that Placido's P65,000 share was manifestly his.
*   **Unlawful Taking:** The petitioner argued there was no unlawful taking.  The CA ruled that the petitioner only had physical custody of the money for a specific purpose and that his failure to fulfill the purpose or return the money constituted unlawful taking.
*   **Intent to Gain:** The petitioner denied any intent to gain. The CA, relying on precedent, stated that intent to gain is presumed from the taking of property belonging to another.
*   **Defense:** The petitioner claimed he acted as a guarantor and only assisted in paying the hardware store.  The courts found this unconvincing and inconsistent with other testimonies.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***U.S. v. De Vera, 43 Phil. 1000 (1921):*** Established the distinction between theft and estafa based on *juridical possession*. If a person is only entrusted with *material or physical possession*, misappropriation constitutes theft. If given *juridical possession*, misappropriation is estafa.
*   ***People v. Trinidad, 50 Phil. 65 (1927)*** Reiterated the De Vera ruling in finding someone guilty of theft when they were only given material possession.
*   ***People v. Locson, 57 Phil. 325 (1932)*** Held that bank tellers have only material possession, and thus an appropriation is considered theft.
*   ***People v. Isaac, 96 Phil. 931 (1955):*** Upheld conviction for theft where the jeepney driver failed to return it to its owner.
*   ***Roque v. People, G.R. No. 138954 (2004)*** Reiterated the principles set in People v. Isaac.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 308 (Theft)**
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 309 (Penalties for theft)**
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1790 (Partnerships: equal contributions unless otherwise stipulated)**
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1797 (Partnerships: distribution of profits and losses)**

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The appeal heavily relies on re-evaluating facts and witness credibility, which are generally not within the purview of a Rule 45 petition.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction hinges on inferences drawn from the petitioner's actions and the inconsistencies in the defense witnesses' testimonies.
*   **Determination of Intent:** Intent to gain is a crucial element, and the court relies on presumptions and inferences from the circumstances.  Arguably, a more robust defense could have focused on challenging the strength of this inference.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for theft, applying the *De Vera* doctrine that misappropriation of property where only physical possession was transferred constitutes theft, not estafa. The petitioner's arguments challenging ownership, unlawful taking, and intent to gain were rejected. The court upheld the indeterminate sentence and civil liability imposed by the lower courts.
