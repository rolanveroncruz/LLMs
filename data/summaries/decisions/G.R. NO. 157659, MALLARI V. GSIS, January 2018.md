**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Eligio P. Mallari.

**Holding:** Atty. Mallari found GUILTY of violating the Lawyer's Oath; Canons 10 and 12; and Rules 10.03, 12.02, and 12.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and is suspended from the practice of law for two (2) years.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Violated by promoting groundless suits and delaying legal proceedings maliciously.
*   **Canon 10 (CPR):** Requires candor, fairness, and good faith to the court. Violated by arguing previously rejected cases and abusing the right of recourse. *See Plus Builders, Inc. v. Revilla, Jr., A.C. No. 7056, September 13, 2006, 501 SCRA 615.*
*   **Rule 10.03 (CPR):** Requires lawyers to observe rules of procedure and not misuse them to defeat justice. Violated through dilatory tactics obstructing execution of judgment.
*   **Canon 12 (CPR):** Requires lawyers to assist in speedy and efficient administration of justice.
*   **Rule 12.02 (CPR):** Prohibits filing multiple actions arising from the same cause. Violated by filing Civil Case No. 12053.
*   **Rule 12.04 (CPR):** Prohibits unduly delaying a case, impeding execution, or misusing court processes.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for two (2) years, effective upon receipt of the decision. *See Salabao v. Villaruel, Jr., A.C. No. 8084, August 24, 2015, 768 SCRA 1, 13; Avida Land Corporation (formerly Laguna Properties Holdings, Inc.) v. Argosino, A.C. No. 7437, August 17, 2016, 800 SCRA 510, 523-524.*

**Underlying Facts & Case History:**

*   Atty. Mallari obtained loans from GSIS secured by mortgages. Foreclosure ensued due to non-payment.
*   Atty. Mallari filed multiple actions (injunction, consignation) to prevent foreclosure and execution, all of which were ultimately unsuccessful, with G.R. No. 124468 resulting in a final and executory judgment in favor of GSIS.
*   Subsequent actions (motion to quash writ, contempt motions) deemed dilatory tactics.
*   The Supreme Court in G.R. No. 157659 directed the IBP-CBD to investigate Atty. Mallari.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ratification of Counsel's Actions:** Although Atty. Mallari claimed his counsel drafted most of the pleadings, the Supreme Court held that by filing the Petition for Review in G.R. No. 157659, he ratified the previous actions undertaken by his counsel.  This could be seen as expanding the scope of liability for actions taken by retained counsel.

**Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law)
*   Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)
*   Civil Code, Art. 429
*   Rules of Court, Rule 139-B, Section 12(b)

**Key Case Law Referenced:**

*   *Mallari v. Government Service Insurance System*, 611 SCRA 32 (G.R. No. 157659) - Foundation for the disciplinary action.
*   *Plus Builders, Inc. v. Revilla, Jr.*, A.C. No. 7056, September 13, 2006, 501 SCRA 615 - Jurisprudence on a lawyer's duty to the court.
*   *Alonso v. Relamida, Jr.*, A.C. No. 8481, August 3, 2010, 626 SCRA 281 - Related to the violation of Canon 12 of the CPR.
*   *Salabao v. Villaruel, Jr.*, A.C. No. 8084, August 24, 2015, 768 SCRA 1, 13; Avida Land Corporation (formerly Laguna Properties Holdings, Inc.) v. Argosino, A.C. No. 7437, August 17, 2016, 800 SCRA 510, 523-524 - Pertaining to the penalty of suspension.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   The Supreme Court's decision heavily relies on the finding that Atty. Mallari's actions were *deliberate and in bad faith*. This subjective determination could be challenged on appeal, arguing insufficient evidence of malicious intent.
