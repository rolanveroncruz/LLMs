**Legal Document Summary: Joseph Typingco vs. Lina Wong Lim, et al. (G.R. No. 181232, October 23, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision, involving a dispute over title to real property conveyed via *dacion en pago*.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Joseph Typingco (Creditor)
*   **Respondents:** Lina Wong Lim, Jerry Sychingho, Jackson Sychingho, and Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI, successor-in-interest to Far East Bank and Trust Company - FEBTC) (Debtors/Mortgagors & Bank)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan & Default:** Respondents-spouses Lina and Johnson Sychingho borrowed USD 600,000 from Typingco, evidenced by a promissory note co-signed by their children, Jerry and Jackson, as sureties. They defaulted.
*   ***Dacion en Pago***: Lina, Jerry, and Jackson conveyed their house and lot (1/3 owned by Lina, the other 2/3 by Jerry and Jackson) to Typingco via *dacion en pago* to settle the debt.
*   **Existing Mortgage:** FEBTC (now BPI) held a real estate mortgage on the property securing obligations of Lina and Johnson, as well as Comprehensive Surety Agreements related to JSY International Philippines, Inc. and J&J Brothers Corporation. This mortgage was annotated on the title (TCT No. 6259-R).
*   **Dispute:** Typingco sued for specific performance to obtain the owner's duplicate title. BPI refused to surrender it, claiming the property secured the Sychinghos' other outstanding obligations.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC and CA ruled against Typingco, holding he was bound by the FEBTC mortgage due to annotation on the title and his failure to verify the property's status.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision, ruling in favor of Typingco.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **BPI's Obligation:** The Supreme Court ordered BPI to surrender the owner's duplicate title to the Register of Deeds.
*   **Mortgage Subsistence:** The Court explicitly states that the mortgage in favor of BPI subsists notwithstanding the change in ownership.  Typingco, as the new owner, takes the property subject to the existing mortgage.
*   **Sychinghos' (or their business entities) Obligations:**  The Court acknowledged that the extent of the obligations is not a concern for Typingco since he agreed to extinguish the spouses' outstanding obligation with the unconditional conveyance of the property. However, the existing mortgage for the Sychinghos' or their business entities' other debts is recognized as continuing security for those other obligations.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mortgage Foreclosure:** The biggest risk for Typingco is BPI potentially foreclosing on the mortgage if the Sychinghos or the entities for which they were sureties fail to meet their other obligations. This could result in Typingco losing the property, even though it was conveyed to him via *dacion en pago*.
*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** While the Court acknowledged the dacion, if the property's value is significantly less than the underlying debt secured by the FEBTC mortgage, BPI could argue that the security is impaired and pursue the Sychinghos for the deficiency.
*   **Deficiency Claim by BPI against Sychinghos**: The Sychinghos remain potentially liable to BPI if after foreclosure, the sale price does not cover the amount of the debt of the other companies where they signed as sureties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***Dacion en Pago***: Defined as delivery and transmission of ownership of another thing by the debtor to the creditor as an accepted equivalent of performance of an obligation. (Citing *Aquintey v. Tibong*, G.R. No. 166704, December 20, 2006, 511 SCRA 414, 438-439.)
*   **Mortgage as a Lien:** A mortgage does not affect the ownership of the property; it is merely a lien. (*Lagrosa v. Court of Appeals*, 371 Phil. 225, 240 (1999).)
*   **Real Estate Mortgage Subsistence:** Real estate mortgage subsists notwithstanding changes in ownership. (*Asuncion v. Evangelista*, 375 Phil. 328, 357 (1999).)
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 107:** Remedy for compelling surrender of withheld duplicate certificates of title. (Although Typingco's action was for specific performance, the Court deemed it substantial compliance.)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exact amount of the outstanding obligations secured by the FEBTC/BPI mortgage is not specified. This makes it difficult to assess the full extent of Typingco's risk.
*   While the Court acknowledges the dacion, the scope and specific obligations extinguished as a result of the dacion are open to interpretation. The decision does not fully address BPI's potential claims related to the Sychinghos' other obligations.
*   The court dismissed an argument by the Petitioner that the real estate mortgage submitted as evidence by BPI was inadmissible because the witness who presented the document did not have personal knowledge.
*   The Court noted that individual respondents waived their right to file a comment since their argument had become the same as that of the petitioner. This can be problematic as it may bind future parties.
