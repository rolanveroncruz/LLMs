**Case:** *City of Iloilo v. Smart Communications, Inc.*, G.R. No. 167260 (2009)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision, holding that Smart Communications, Inc. (SMART) is *not* exempt from local franchise and business taxes imposed by the City of Iloilo. The Court found SMART liable for P764,545.29 in deficiency taxes for the years 1997-2001, plus surcharges and interest.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **City of Iloilo's Argument:** SMART is liable for local taxes under the Local Government Code (LGC), specifically Sections 137 & 151. Tax exemptions granted to SMART are impliedly removed by Section 193 of the LGC. SMART is also liable for surcharges and interests.
*   **SMART's Argument:** Exempt from local franchise and business taxes based on:
    *   **Section 9 of R.A. No. 7294 (SMART's Franchise):** Provided for a 3% franchise tax on gross receipts "in lieu of all taxes."
    *   **Section 23 of R.A. No. 7925 (Public Telecommunications Policy Act):** "Equality clause" stating existing privileges, incentives, or exemptions under existing franchises shall automatically extend to previously granted franchises. SMART argues this extends any local tax exemptions granted to later telecommunications franchises to them.
    *   SMART argued good faith reliance of the BLGF ruling that they are exempt from local franchise tax.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Tax Exemption Principles:** Tax exemptions are construed *strictly* against the claimant (SMART), citing *Government of the Philippine Islands v. Monte de Piedad* (1916) and subsequent cases. The burden is on SMART to prove the exemption clearly and unequivocally.
*   **LGC Section 193:** While Section 193 of the LGC withdraws existing tax exemptions, the Court acknowledges this only applies to exemptions *existing* before the LGC's effectivity (January 1, 1992). SMART's franchise was granted *after* this date (March 27, 1992), so Section 193 does not directly apply. However, the grant of the exception must still be clear and unmistakable.
*   **SMART's Franchise (R.A. No. 7294, Sec. 9):** The "in lieu of all taxes" clause does not unequivocally exempt SMART from *all* taxes. The language is unclear whether it covers both national *and* local taxes. *Smart Communications, Inc. v. City of Davao* (G.R. No. 155491, September 16, 2008) applied the principle that because it is not explicitly stated, it should be construed against SMART.
    *   Further, the "in lieu of all taxes" clause refers to the franchise tax. Since franchise taxes on telecommunications companies were *abolished* by R.A. No. 7716 (Expanded Value-Added Tax Law), the "in lieu of all taxes" clause is now *functus officio* (no longer operative).
*   **Public Telecoms Act (R.A. No. 7925, Sec. 23):** The "equality clause" does *not* extend tax exemptions. The term "exemption" in Section 23 refers to exemptions from regulatory requirements, not tax exemptions citing *PLDT v. City of Davao* (G.R. No. 143867, August 22, 2001). Intent to grant a tax exemption must be clear and express, which is not found in the text of the law.
*   **Surcharges and Interests:** Court ruled that SMART could not rely on BLGF to prove good faith, as BLGF interpretation of local taxes is not authoritative and persuasive.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Tax Liability:** SMART is liable for the assessed deficiency local franchise and business taxes (P764,545.29).
*   **Surcharges and Interests:** SMART is liable for surcharges and interests on the unpaid taxes.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7294 (SMART's Franchise), Sec. 9**
*   **R.A. No. 7925 (Public Telecommunications Policy Act), Sec. 23**
*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code), Sections 137, 151, 193, 252**
*   **R.A. No. 7716 (Expanded Value-Added Tax Law)**
*   **Government of the Philippine Islands v. Monte de Piedad, 35 Phil. 42 (1916)**
*   **Smart Communications, Inc. v. City of Davao, G.R. No. 155491 (2008)**
*   **PLDT v. City of Davao, G.R. No. 143867 (2001, 2003)**
*   **Digital Telecommunications, Inc. v. City Government of Batangas, et al., G.R. No. 156040, December 11, 2008**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"In Lieu of All Taxes" Clause (R.A. 7294, Sec. 9):** The ambiguity of whether this clause encompasses *both* national and local taxes was a central issue, ultimately resolved against SMART.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the principle of strict construction against tax exemptions. SMART's reliance on both its franchise and the Public Telecommunications Policy Act failed due to the lack of clear and unequivocal language granting the claimed exemption.
