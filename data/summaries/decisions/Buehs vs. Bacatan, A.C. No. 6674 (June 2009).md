**Case Summary: _Robert Bernhard Buehs v. Atty. Inocencio T. Bacatan_ (A.C. No. 6674, June 30, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Disbarment proceeding against Atty. Bacatan for representation of conflicting interests, gross misconduct (usurpation of authority), and failure to pay IBP dues.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Conflicting Interests:** Atty. Bacatan, while acting as a Voluntary Arbitrator in a labor case (NCMB RB IX Case No. VA-12-0045-879) between Genaro Alvarez & Sergia Malukuh (employees) vs. Mar Fishing Company, Inc. and/or Robert Buehs, also represented Alvarez and Malukuh in a criminal complaint filed against Buehs arising from the same underlying facts. He signed an indorsement as "counsel for the complainants" in the criminal case, while the labor case was still pending.
*   **Usurpation of Authority:** Atty. Bacatan issued a Hold Departure Order and placed Buehs on the Bureau of Immigration's (BID) Watchlist without notice or hearing, despite lacking the authority to do so. This violates Supreme Court Circular No. 39-97 which specifies that only RTCs can issue Hold Departure Orders in criminal cases.
*   **IBP Dues:** Atty. Bacatan failed to update his IBP membership dues and pay his community tax certificate.
*   **Respondent's Arguments:** Atty. Bacatan argued that he was *functus officio* at the time of his representation in the criminal case, and that the reference to "counsel for the complainants" was a misprint. The court rejected these arguments.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Code of Professional Responsibility:** Atty. Bacatan violated Rules 15.01 and 15.03 prohibiting representation of conflicting interests without informed consent of all parties (citing _Samala v. Valencia_ and _Pormento, Sr. v. Pontevedra_).
*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law:** Atty. Bacatan acted with gross ignorance by issuing the Hold Departure Order in violation of Circular 39-97 (citing _Tadlip v. Borres, Jr._).
*   **Violation of Rules of Court:** Failure to pay IBP dues and community tax certificate is a violation of Sections 9 and 10, Rule 139-A of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **No material ambiguities in the ruling itself.** All findings of fact and law were against Bacatan
*   **Respondent Atty. Inocencio T. Bacatan is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for two (2) years.**
