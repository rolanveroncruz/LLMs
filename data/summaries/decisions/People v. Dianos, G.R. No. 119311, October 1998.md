Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Romeo Dianos*, G.R. No. 119311, October 7, 1998

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of Murder, one count of Frustrated Murder, and two counts of Attempted Murder.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crimes Charged:** The accused was charged via five separate informations with Murder (two counts relating to the deaths of Teresita Ortiz and Ricardo Pablo), Attempted Murder (two counts relating to injuries of Virgilio Ortiz and Zaldy Ortiz), and Frustrated Murder (relating to injuries of Lizette Ortiz). All informations alleged intent to kill, treachery, evident premeditation, conspiracy, and aggravating circumstances of nighttime and use of a motor vehicle.  Violation of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt on all counts and sentenced him to Reclusion Perpetua for the Murder convictions, and varying terms of imprisonment under the Indeterminate Sentence Law for the Attempted and Frustrated Murder convictions. The RTC also awarded damages, including indemnity for death and actual damages.

*   **Accused's Defense:** The accused claimed denial and asserted that an unidentified "military man" committed the shootings. He also argued that the prosecution witnesses were biased and that a paraffin test yielded negative results.

*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court **AFFIRMED** the RTC decision with **MODIFICATIONS** on the damages awarded.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The accused remains criminally liable for the crimes of Murder (x2), Frustrated Murder, and Attempted Murder (x2).
*   **Civil Liability:** The accused is liable for the following:
    *   **Indemnity for Death:** P50,000.00 to the heirs of Teresita Ortiz and P50,000.00 to the heirs of Ricardo Pablo (affirmed).
    *   **Moral Damages:** P30,000.00 to each of the deceased's heirs.
    *   **Nominal Damages:** The Supreme Court deleted the RTC awards for actual damages for lack of substantiation and instead awarded Nominal damages: P15,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 8524-R and No. 8528-R; P10,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 8527-R; and P5,000.00 in Criminal Case No. 8525-R and No. 8526-R.
    *   **Imprisonment Terms:** Remain as determined by the RTC.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Accomplice at Large:** The decision notes that a co-accused ("John Doe") remains at large. The potential for future apprehension and testimony by this co-accused could present further risk or information.
*   **Damages Modification:** The Supreme Court's decision to replace actual damages with nominal damages suggests a failure of the prosecution to adequately prove pecuniary loss with supporting documentation as stipulated in *Fuentes, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals*. This could be scrutinized in future cases.
* **Evident Premeditation:** As the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts decision, the issue of evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance for murder, when the time between determination and execution of the crime was short, could be raised.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 248 (Murder), Articles 6 and 51 (Attempted Murder), Articles 6 and 50 (Frustrated Murder), Articles 100, 104(3) (Civil Liability).
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 2206, 2217, 2219, 2222.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** *People vs. So, People vs. Godoy, People vs. Alban, People vs. Patamama* (Relationship to victim does not automatically impair credibility absent ulterior motive).
*   **Res Gestae:** *People vs. Sanchez, Pantranco North Express, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, People vs. Manhuyod, Jr.* (Elements required for admissibility).
*   **Paraffin Test:** *People vs. Teehankee, Jr.* (Paraffin test unreliable).
*   **Actual Damages:** *Del Mundo vs. Court of Appeals, Fuentes, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals* (Must be proven with reasonable certainty).
*   **Nominal Damages:** *Sumalpong vs. Court of Appeals*, Article 2222 of the Civil Code.

**Contentious Issues:**

*   The accused's defense rested heavily on the supposed "lack of motive" and the negative paraffin test. The Supreme Court correctly dismissed these arguments based on established jurisprudence.
*   The reliance on eyewitness testimony from individuals related to the victims was challenged, but the Court found no reason to doubt their credibility absent evidence of ulterior motives.

**Overall:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, adjusting only the financial awards for actual damages, demonstrating a strong affirmation of the trial court's findings of guilt based on the evidence presented, particularly the eyewitness accounts. The decision clarifies the distinctions between actual, moral, and nominal damages in criminal cases, as well as the requirements for proving each type of damage.

I hope this is helpful!
