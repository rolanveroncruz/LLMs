**Case Summary: *Mocorro v. Ramirez*, G.R. No. 178366 (2008)**

**Core Issue:** Dispute over cockpit operation rights in Caibiran, Biliran. Focus is on the execution of a final RTC decision, specifically the calculation and validity of actual damages awarded for the illegal operation of a competing cockpit.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PGC Decision (1990):** Declared Mocorro, Jr. the rightful cockpit operator in Caibiran and cancelled Azur's registration. Mocorro obtained Registration Certificate No. P90-943.
*   **RTC Decision (1995):** Found Ramirez (mayor) and Azur guilty of indirect contempt for violating a preliminary injunction against operating a competing cockpit. Ordered them to pay Mocorro:
    *   ₱1,000 fine for contempt.
    *   Permanent injunction against further cockfights.
    *   Joint and several liability for:
        *   ₱2,000 actual damages every Sunday from August 2, 1992.
        *   ₱10,000 attorney's fees.
        *   ₱5,000 litigation expenses.
        *   ₱20,000 exemplary damages.
*   **CA Decision (2006):** On Petition for Certiorari, partially granted the petition to exclude the requirement that petitioner to pay private respondent actual damages and set aside Orders dated September 8, 2003 and the November 6, 2003 as well as the Writ of Execution dated May 27, 2002. The CA predicated its above ruling on the grounds that the final fallo lacked and exact amount awarded as actual damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Ramirez and Azur held jointly and severally liable for actual damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and exemplary damages per the RTC decision (as modified by the Supreme Court).
*   Primary dispute revolves around the calculation of actual damages due to the RTC fallo lacking a termination date for the ₱2,000/Sunday payments.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgement:** The RTC failed to define to when the ₱2,000 per sunday liability will end.
*   **Contempt Proceedings:** While Ramirez and Azur were found in contempt, continued violations of the injunction could lead to further contempt charges.
*   **Calculation of Damages:** Correctly computing the damages due is still subject to risk.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 (Certiorari):** Respondent attempted to use certiorari to challenge execution, effectively attacking a final and executory judgment.
*   **Doctrine of Immutability of Judgments:**  Cited extensively by the Supreme Court, emphasizing the finality of court decisions and the limited exceptions for modification (clerical errors, *nunc pro tunc* entries, void judgments).  Cites *Collantes v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 169604* and *Peña v. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), G.R. No. 159520*
*   ***Nunc Pro Tunc* Entry:**  The Supreme Court invoked this exception to clarify the final date for calculating actual damages. Cites *Briones-Vasquez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 144882*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **RTC Fallo regarding actual damages:** The lack of a termination date for the ₱2,000/Sunday payments was the central ambiguity leading to this litigation.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Granted Mocorro's petition.
*   Modified the CA decision.
*   Held Ramirez and Azur jointly and severally liable for actual damages of ₱2,000 *per actual cockfight* held in Azur's cockpit from August 2, 1992, to June 22, 2001 (the date the RTC decision became final).
*   Ordered the RTC to issue an amended decision incorporating this clarification (*nunc pro tunc*).

**Legal Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case is significant for its reaffirmation of the immutability of final judgments and the limited scope of exceptions. The Supreme Court's application of the *nunc pro tunc* principle provided a legally sound means of resolving an ambiguity in the original fallo without impermissibly modifying a final order. This case reinforces the importance of precise drafting of judgment fallos, particularly regarding damages. The attempt to use certiorari to circumvent the finality of a judgment was correctly rejected.
