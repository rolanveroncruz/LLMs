## Legal Document Summary: *Iglesia De Jesucristo Jerusalem Nueva of Manila, Philippines, Inc. v. Loida Dela Cruz* (G.R. No. 208284, April 23, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting a CA decision that affirmed the RTC’s ruling, which upheld the MeTC’s dismissal of an unlawful detainer complaint filed by the Iglesia De Jesucristo Jerusalem Nueva of Manila, Philippines, Inc. ("Petitioner"), represented by Francisco Galvez, against Loida Dela Cruz ("Respondent"). The core issue is the right to possess a parcel of land covered by OCT No. (8257) M-35266.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** Both parties claim the right to possess the land. Petitioner bases its claim on a reconstituted title (OCT No. (8257) M-35266) in the name of "The Iglesia De Jesucristo Jerusalem Nueva of Manila, Philippines, Inc." Respondent claims through the Obispo Representante at Pastor General ng Iglesia ni JesuKristo "Bagong Jerusalem" Inc., arguing that the two entities are one and the same and that she is the authorized representative.

*   **Tolerance Argument:** Petitioner alleges that Respondent's occupation was by mere tolerance and terminated upon a demand to vacate.

*   **Timeline & Registration:** Petitioner was registered with SEC in 1999, while Respondent's organization (or its predecessor) was registered in 1955. However the OCT original dates from 1940.

*   **Reconstituted Title Issue:** Respondent challenges the validity of Petitioner's reconstituted title, alleging that the original was not lost and that Petitioner was not yet in existence at the time the original title was issued. Galvez obtained a new title claiming loss.

*   **Prior Ejectment Case:** A prior ejectment case filed by Respondent against Petitioner was dismissed. Petitioner alleges that only some occupants of the subject lot vacated the premises.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligations:** To prove a cause of action for unlawful detainer, including initial lawful possession followed by unlawful withholding after demand within one year before filing the complaint.

*   **Respondent's Liabilities:** If Petitioner had succeeded, to vacate the premises and pay rent, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** Petitioner argues that Respondent's claim that the two churches are the same constitutes a collateral attack on its title, prohibited under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree). However, the court ruled that ownership was being discussed to determine who had the better right to possess the property.

*   **Ambiguity regarding organizational identity:** The dispute over whether "The Iglesia De Jesucristo Jerusalem Nueva of Manila, Philippines, Inc." and "Obispo Representante at Pastor General ng Iglesia ni JesuKristo "Bagong Jerusalem" Inc." are the same entity is crucial. The Court of Appeals upheld lower courts' finding that the two entities are one and the same.

*   **Sufficiency of Proof:** Petitioner alleges insufficient evidence from Respondent, particularly a failure to produce original documents.

*   **Tolerance Requirement:** Failure to prove initial tolerance undermines the unlawful detainer claim.

*   **Validity of Reconstituted Title:** The questionable circumstances surrounding the issuance of the reconstituted title weakens Petitioner's claim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** governs unlawful detainer actions.
*   **Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529:** Prohibits collateral attacks on Torrens titles.
*   **Article 428 of the Civil Code:** Grants the owner the right to possess, enjoy, dispose, and recover property.

**Court's Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the lower courts' findings. The Court found that the question of ownership was necessary to determine the better right to possess. The court also noted that petitioner failed to prove tolerance and that the circumstances of the reconstituted title weakened their claim.

**Key takeaways**

*   **Failure to Establish Tolerance**: A critical failure for the Petitioner.
*   **Doubts About Ownership**: Arising from the reconstituted title, and also about the age and identity of the Corporation.
