**Case Summary: *Heirs of Toribio Waga v. Isabelo Sacabin*, G.R. No. 159131, July 27, 2009 (611 Phil. 433)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Court of Appeals decision affirming RTC decision.

**Key Facts:**

*   **Land Dispute:** Dispute over a 790 sq.m. portion of land (Lot No. 452) claimed by Respondent Sacabin but included within the boundaries of Original Certificate of Title No. P-8599 (OCT P-8599) issued to Petitioners, the Heirs of Toribio Waga, based on Free Patent No. 411315.
*   **Possession:** Respondent and his predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, peaceful, and adverse possession of Lot No. 452 (including the disputed portion) since 1940. Seven 50 year old coconut trees formed a natural boundary line.
*   **Title History:** Free Patent issued in 1968, OCT registered in 1974. Respondent filed a protest with DENR in 1991.
*   **DENR Finding:** DENR investigation recommended annulment of Petitioners' Free Patent and OCT concerning the 790 sq.m. encroachment.
*   **Procedural History:** Respondent filed a complaint for Amendment of Original Certificate of Title, Ejectment, and Damages in RTC after DENR failed to act. RTC ruled in favor of Respondent, ordering segregation and reconveyance. CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Reconveyance:** Petitioners are ordered to segregate and reconvey the 790 sq.m. portion to Respondent.
*   **Ejectment:** Petitioners, particularly Elves Galarosa and all those occupying the disputed portion, are ordered to vacate.
*   **Damages:** Petitioners are ordered to pay P50,000 in damages, P30,000 in attorney's fees, and P10,000 in litigation costs.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Land:** Petitioners stand to lose the disputed 790 sq.m. portion of their registered land.
*   **Monetary Judgment:** Joint and several liability for damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs.
*   **Ejectment:** Loss of possession for any occupants of the disputed area under Petitioners' control.

**Legal Arguments/Case Law:**

*   **Indefeasibility of Title:** Petitioners argued that OCT P-8599 is indefeasible after one year. The Court rejected this argument, citing that the action was not a direct or collateral attack on the title, but rather a claim to correct the area covered by title.
*   **Action for Reconveyance:** The Court characterized the action as one for reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust, arising from the erroneous registration of the property.
*   **Prescription:** Petitioners raised prescription. The Court held that the ten-year prescriptive period for reconveyance does not apply when the claimant (Respondent) is in possession of the land, which is therefore an action to quiet title, which is imprescriptible. Citing ***Caragay-Layno v. CA*** which supported the holding that prescription does not run against one in lawful possession seeking to quiet title.
*   **Superior Right:** The Court affirmed Respondent's superior right to the disputed portion due to long-standing possession since 1940. Citing ***Mendizabel v. Apao*** which supports the principle that reconveyance is proper where the registered owner was never in possession and another party possessed in the concept of owner.
*   ***Torrens System***: While the system guarantees the integrity and conclusiveness of the certificate of registration, the court stressed it is not intended to perpetrate fraud against the real owner of the registered land.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The specification of *Elves Galarosa* as a defendant who must vacate implies a specific individual liability, but the ruling also broadly orders "all defendants occupying inside or in possession" to vacate. This requires clarification on the extent of the ejectment order.
*   The nature of the “damages” awarded (P50,000) is not defined in the decision. This is a potentially contentious point on appeal as it is unclear if this represents actual damages suffered by the Respondent, or another category of damages.

**Statutory References:**

*   Implied/Constructive Trust (relevant to the basis for the reconveyance action, potentially arising from provisions of the Civil Code).
*   Rules on prescription of actions (Civil Code).
*   Provisions regarding actions to quiet title (Rules of Court, Article 476 of the Civil Code).
*   Public Land Act related to Free Patents.

**Potential Actions for Lawyer:**

*   Review the evidence and the arguments in the records to asses if the claim of possession is truly uncontroverted.
*   Assess the evidence supporting the damage award.
*   Analyze the record to determine if any of the arguments regarding the indefeasibility of title apply.
*   Determine if the DENR investigation and report would be admissible as evidence in future actions.
