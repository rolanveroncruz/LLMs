## Legal Document Summary: *Citibank, N.A. vs. Andres and Cabusay, Jr.* (G.R. No. 197074)

**Case Overview:** This case involves a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's decision to annul the NLRC's decision, which had set aside the finality of the judgment in a constructive dismissal case filed by former Citibank employees Andres and Cabusay, Jr.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Andres and Cabusay, Jr. allege constructive dismissal after resigning following an internal investigation into alleged misdeeds.
*   **Notice of Resolution:** Critical issue revolves around whether Citibank (petitioner) received proper notice of the NLRC First Division's Resolution and Entry of Judgment. Sec. 6, Rule III of the 2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the NLRC defines the notice to parties, including the method of delivery by registered mail to both parties and their counsel on record
*   **Withdrawal of Counsel:** Ponce Enrile Reyes & Manalastas Law Offices (PECABAR) withdrew as Citibank's counsel. A key question is if they properly notified the NLRC of their withdrawal after receiving the resolution.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Citibank's Liability:** The original NLRC First Division decision favored Andres and Cabusay, Jr., potentially exposing Citibank to monetary liabilities for constructive dismissal.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Citibank argued that the failure to properly notify their new counsel (Romulo Mabanta Buenaventura Sayoc & De Los Angeles Law Offices (RMBSA)) of the NLRC decision violated their right to due process.
*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** A conflicting CA decision (G.R. No. 201344), affirming the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of the constructive dismissal claim, became final and executory. The Supreme Court is grappling with upholding a final decision despite procedural issues.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Doctrine of Immutability of Judgment:** The Court acknowledges the principle that final judgments are immutable and unalterable, citing *Pinewood Marine (Phils.), Inc. v. EMCO Plywood Corporation* (G.R. No. 179789, June 17, 2015).
*   **Exceptions to Immutability:** The Court also identifies exceptions, including clerical errors, nunc pro tunc entries, void judgments, and situations rendering execution unjust, citing *Tomas v. Criminal Investigation and Detection Group-Anti-Organized Crime Division (CIDG-AOCD)* (G.R. No. 208090, November 9, 2016).
*   **Consolidation of Cases:** Reference to *Serrano v. Ambassador Hotel, Inc.* (G.R. No. 197003, February 11, 2013) highlights the CA's error in failing to consolidate the related petitions.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Adequacy of Notice:** Whether PECABAR provided adequate notice of their withdrawal to the NLRC First Division after receiving a copy of the December Resolution.
*   **Negligence of RMBSA:** The CA suggested RMBSA was negligent in not inquiring into the case status promptly.
*   **Conflicting CA Decisions:** Existence of two conflicting CA decisions (one favoring Citibank, one favoring the employees) creates a complex situation.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court **granted** Citibank's petition, setting aside the CA decision that favored the employees and reinstating the NLRC Second Division's decision. This decision rests on the principle of upholding the final and executory CA decision (G.R. No. 201344) despite the procedural issues regarding notice.
