## Legal Document Summary: Abakada Guro Party List vs. Purisima (G.R. No. 166715)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of Republic Act (RA) 9335, the Attrition Act of 2005, which aimed to improve revenue collection in the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) through a system of rewards and sanctions. The petitioners, Abakada Guro Party List, argued that the law (1) creates mercenaries and bounty hunters out of BIR and BOC employees, thereby violating accountability; (2) violates equal protection by limiting the reward system to BIR and BOC employees; (3) unduly delegates power to fix revenue targets to the President without sufficient standards; and (4) violates separation of powers by creating a congressional oversight committee.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rewards and Incentives Fund (Fund):** Created from excess revenue collections by the BIR and BOC. Funds are deemed automatically appropriated and are allocated proportionally to each agency's contribution to the excess collection.
*   **Revenue Performance Evaluation Board (Board):** Created within both the BIR and BOC, comprised of representatives from various government agencies and employees. The Board's duties include prescribing rules for fund allocation, setting criteria for personnel removal for underperformance (at least 7.5% below target), terminating personnel, setting performance evaluation systems, issuing rules, and submitting annual reports to Congress.
*   **Revenue Targets:** Determined by the Development Budget and Coordinating Committee (DBCC) and included in the Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing (BESF).
*   **Liability of Officials:** Officials and employees of the BIR and BOC are held liable for any loss or injury suffered by any business establishment or taxpayer as a result of violations of the law, negligence, abuses, or acts of malfeasance or misfeasance.

**Potential Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Possible Abuse of Power:** The reward system creates a risk of aggressive or unethical revenue collection practices by BIR and BOC employees.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Dismissals:** While the law mandates due process, there is a risk that personnel could be unfairly targeted and dismissed for underperformance.
*   **Enforcement Difficulties:** Difficulties in establishing and enforcing the criteria for negligence, abuses, or acts of malfeasance or misfeasance.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution:** Article XI, Section 1 (Public office as a public trust); Equal Protection Clause.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987:** Governs the functions of the BIR and BOC.
*   **United States v. Matthews, Dorsheimer v. United States:** These US Supreme Court decisions validated laws providing rewards to customs officers for detecting fraudulent attempts to evade duties and taxes.
*   **Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers' Union:** This case provides legal foundation on the Equal Protection Clause.
*   **Pelaez v. Auditor General:** This decision defines Completeness and Sufficient Standard Tests in determining the validity of legislative power delegation.
*   **INS v. Chadha:** US Supreme Court decision, although not binding, holds that the use of legislative vetoes are unconstitutional.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Standard for fixing revenue targets:** While the DBCC provides scrutiny, petitioners argue that the law lacks sufficient standards for the President's role.
*   **Criteria for determining the economic difficulties brought about by natural calamities or force majeure or economic causes**
*   **Criteria for negligence, abuses, or acts of malfeasance or misfeasance**

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **partially granted** the petition. It upheld the constitutionality of RA 9335 *except* for Section 12, which created the Joint Congressional Oversight Committee. Section 12 was declared unconstitutional as it violated the principle of separation of powers by allowing legislative participation in the implementation of the law. The remaining provisions of RA 9335 were held to be valid and enforceable due to the presence of a separability clause.

**Key Points for Counsel:**

*   The case affirms the importance of the separation of powers.
*   The court provides guidelines and boundaries for the exercise of congressional oversight power.
*   Legislative Vetoes are declared as unconstitutional.
*   While a reward system for revenue collection is permissible, the specific mechanism created by RA 9335 must adhere to the constitutional requirements.

**Tinga's Concurring Opinion**
* The President's power to formulate Implementing Rules and Regulations is **not inherently executive**. The basis of such is the **delegation of power** from Congress to the executive.
