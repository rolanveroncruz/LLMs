## Legal Document Summary: *Joseph C. Sy v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 237703, October 3, 2018)*

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan (SB) Resolutions denying motions for Allow Departure Orders (ADO).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Right to Travel:**  The decision reiterates the constitutional right to travel but acknowledges its limitations, including court's power to restrict travel of criminal defendants released on bail (citing *Marcos v. Sandiganbayan* and *People v. Uy Tuising*).
*   **Purpose of Travel Restriction:** Ensure court's jurisdiction over the accused (citing *Silverio v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Discretion of Court:** Granting or denying ADOs lies within court's sound discretion, but this discretion cannot be arbitrary and must balance the accused's rights with the state's interest (citing *Gutierrez v. People*).
*   **Factors for Consideration:** Court lists concrete variables for assessing ADO requests, including purpose of travel, prior travel history, ties to the Philippines and destination country, extradition availability, reputation, itinerary, etc.
*   **Citizenship:** Public documents (e.g., birth certificates) are prima facie evidence of citizenship (citing *Republic v. Harp*).
* **Jurisdiction:** All ancillary incidents should be resolved by the court handling the main case

**Obligations:**

*   Accused must show the need for travel, but permission should not be unduly withheld if it doesn't deprive the court of jurisdiction.
*   The court should consider the factors listed above in adjudicating motions for ADOs.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused may forfeit bail or be subject to arrest if they violate the conditions of their provisional liberty (failure to appear in court when required).
*   The court may be found to have committed grave abuse of discretion if it arbitrarily denies a valid request for an ADO.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The core issue is whether the SB committed grave abuse of discretion by denying Sy's ADO motions. The Supreme Court found that it did, specifically regarding the denial of the third motion (Motion C), pointing to the arbitrary nature of the denial.
*   **Citizenship Question:** The SB's reliance on unresolved claims against Sy's citizenship, despite a birth certificate showing Filipino citizenship, was deemed problematic. This highlights the potential for bias and reliance on extraneous evidence.
* **Jurisdiction:** If the SB will conduct further inquiries into Sy's requests to travel they may be considered moot.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):**  Sy was charged under Section 3(e)
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:**  Pertains to petitions for certiorari.
*   **Constitution of the Philippines, Article III, Section 2:** Guarantees right to travel.
*   **Constitution of the Philippines, Article III, Section 14(2):** Provides the accused with presumption of innocence.
*   **Manotoc, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, 226 Phil. 75 (1986):**  Concerns court's power to restrict travel of persons admitted to bail.
*   **Silverio v. Court of Appeals, 273 Phil. 128 (1991):**  Highlights the purpose of travel restrictions.
*   **People v. Uy Tuising, 61 Phil. 404 (1935):** Discusses prohibiting an accused from leaving the country
*   **Marcos v. Sandiganbayan, 317 Phil. 149 (1995):** Concerns restriction of right to travel for person out on bail
*   **Cojuanco v. Sandiganbayan, 360 Phil. 559 (1998):**  Demonstrates factors court considers when granting ADOs.
*   **Republic v. Harp, 787 Phil. 33 (2016):** Establishes that birth certificates are prima facie evidence of citizenship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent to which the SB can rely on unsubstantiated allegations or pending investigations to restrict travel.
*   The weight to be given to an accused's business ties and reputation in assessing flight risk.

**Outcome:**

The petition for certiorari was *partly granted*. The SB's Resolution dated January 17, 2018 (denying Motion C) was nullified. The Supreme Court did not grant Sy's direct motion for an ADO, stating it should have been filed with the Sandiganbayan.
