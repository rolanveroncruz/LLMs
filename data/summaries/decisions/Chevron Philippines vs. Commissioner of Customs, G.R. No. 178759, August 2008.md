Okay, here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** Chevron Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs, G.R. No. 178759, August 11, 2008.

**Facts:**

*   Chevron (formerly Caltex) imported crude oil in 1996.
*   Filed Import Entry Declarations (IEDs) and paid 90% of customs duties.
*   Filed Import Entry and Internal Revenue Declarations (IEIRDs) after arrival.
*   Import duties were assessed at a 3% rate under RA 8180 (Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1996). Prior to RA 8180 the rate was 10%.
*   Later, BOC investigated allegations of fraudulent manipulation by Chevron to evade higher duties, prompted by a letter from Alfonso Orioste.
*   BOC assessed Chevron for deficiency customs duties, claiming a 10% rate applied and the IEIRDs were filed late, resulting in abandonment.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Definition of "Entry" (Sec. 1301 & 1801, Tariff and Customs Code - TCC):**
    *   The central dispute is whether "entry" refers only to the IED (as argued by Chevron) or includes the IEIRD.
    *   The court held that "entry" refers to both IED and IEIRD.  Section 205 of the TCC defines "entered" as the filing and acceptance of the "specified entry form" which refers to the IEIRD.
    *   Both must be filed within 30 days of discharge, a non-extendable period.
    *   *Go Ho Lim v. The Insular Collector of Customs*, 64 Phil. 64 (1937) cited, differentiating provisional entry from regular consumption entry.

2.  **Abandonment (Sec. 1801 & 1802, TCC):**
    *   Failure to file the IEIRD within 30 days results in implied abandonment.
    *   Court ruled that the goods were abandoned by Chevron's failure to file the IEIRD within the statutory time frame.
    *   RA 7651 amended Sec. 1801 to remove the requirement of inferring intent to abandon from the importer's action. Failure to file entry is enough.
    *   Sec. 1802 states that an abandoned article *ipso facto* becomes the property of the government.
3.  **Fraud:**
    *   BOC and CTA found that Chevron deliberately delayed filing the IEIRDs to avail of the lower 3% duty rate after RA 8180 took effect.
    *   Chevron did not disclose discrepancies between the 10% duty declared in IEDs and the 3% in IEIRDs.
    *   Finding of fraud precluded the application of prescription under Section 1603 of TCC (Finality of Liquidation).
4.  **Notice Requirement (Sec. 1801, TCC; CMO 15-94):**
    *   Chevron argued that the required "due notice" of abandonment was not provided.
    *   Court held that notice was unnecessary due to Chevron's knowledge of arrival and fraudulent concealment.
    *   The purpose of notice is to notify the importer of the arrival of the shipment. Chevron already had knowledge of the shipment's arrival and deliberately chose not to comply with its obligation under Section 1301.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Chevron was obligated to file both the IED and IEIRD within 30 days of discharge.
*   Chevron was held liable for deficiency customs duties and penalties due to the fraudulent underpayment of duties and abandonment of the imported goods.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Collateral attacks on the constitutionality of Sections 1801 and 1802 of the TCC.
*   Further penalties or sanctions could arise from the finding of fraud.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition and scope of "entry" under the TCC.
*   The application of the "due notice" requirement in cases of fraud and concealment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Tariff and Customs Code (TCC): Sections 204, 205, 1301, 1408, 1603, 1801, 1802
*   Republic Act (RA) 8180 (Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1996)
*   Presidential Decree (PD) 1853
*   Republic Act (RA) 7651
*   Republic Act (RA) 9135
*   Customs Memorandum Order No. 15-94 (CMO 15-94)

**Case Law:**

*   *Go Ho Lim v. The Insular Collector of Customs*, 64 Phil. 64 (1937)

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court denied Chevron's petition.
*   Chevron was ordered to pay the deficiency customs duties.
