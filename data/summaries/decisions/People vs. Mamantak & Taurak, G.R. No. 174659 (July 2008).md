## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Mamantak & Taurak, G.R. No. 174659

**Case Overview:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Raga Sarapida Mamantak and Likad Sarapida Taurak for kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659). The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty due to RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty.

**Key Provisions/Elements of the Crime:**

*   **Article 267, Revised Penal Code (as amended):** Defines kidnapping and serious illegal detention. Key elements proven are:
    *   Accused are private individuals.
    *   Deprivation of liberty of Christopher Basario.
    *   Illegal detention occurred.
    *   Victim was a minor.
    *   Crime committed for purpose of extorting ransom (P30,000).
*   **Ransom Definition:** Money, price, or consideration demanded for the release of a captured person. No specific form required, only intent to use it as a bargaining chip. The amount of the ransom is immaterial in this case.
*   **RA 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty):** Reduced the appellate court-imposed death penalty to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction for Kidnapping for Ransom:** Mamantak and Taurak were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals in the kidnapping.
*   **Joint and Several Liability for Damages:** Ordered to pay Christopher Basario jointly and severally:
    *   P50,000 civil indemnity.
    *   P200,000 moral damages (increased from P50,000 by SC due to minority of the victim).
    *   P100,000 exemplary damages (added by SC due to demand for ransom).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Defense of Innocence/Lack of Intent:** The accused denied kidnapping, claiming they found the boy. Courts found this defense incredible due to inconsistencies and actions demonstrating intent to extort ransom.
*   **Factual Findings of Lower Courts:** Both Trial Court and CA's factual findings were given great weight by the SC. Dissent would be difficult based on facts alone.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 267:** Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention.
*   **Republic Act 7659:** Amended Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Republic Act 9346:** Prohibition of the Death Penalty.
*   **Rule 124 Section 13:** Appellate Procedures in Death Penalty Cases

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Jatulan, G.R. No. 171653, 24 April 2007, 522 SCRA 174:**  Cited for elements of kidnapping and definition of ransom.
*   **People v. Alba, 326 Phil. 519 (1996):** Principles of Credibility. Evidence must come from a believable source and must be credible in itself
*   **People v. Garalde, G.R. No. 173055, 13 April 2007, 521 SCRA 327:**  Affirming the great weight given to Trial Court and appellate courts factual findings.

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   While the Trial Court initially viewed the P30,000 not as ransom but as "reimbursement", the CA and SC correctly determined that this amount did constitute ransom under the law, regardless of the amount.
