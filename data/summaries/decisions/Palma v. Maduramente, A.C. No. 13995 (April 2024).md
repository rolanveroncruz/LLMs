## Legal Document Summary: Palma v. Maduramente (A.C. No. 13995)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Ladimir Ian G. Maduramente.

**Complainant:** Jhycke G. Palma, representing The Great Warrior Homeowner's Association.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Gross Negligence (Civil Case No. 6502-3):** Maduramente failed to attend pre-trial conference (claiming Manila trip), failed to file pre-trial brief or judicial affidavits, and filed a late Notice of Appeal. MTCC explicitly stated counsel "left unattended"
*   **Conflict of Interest (Civil Case No. 8506):** Maduramente represented both the plaintiffs (seeking annulment of title) and the intervenors (Palma's group asserting adverse claim on the same title).
*   **Applicable Law:**  The Court applies the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) (A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC) despite the infractions occurring under the CPR.
*   **Sanctions:** Because Maduramente was previously disbarred for other misconduct, the court cannot impose suspension, but records the penalty and imposes a fine.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty of Diligence and Competence (CPRA, Canon IV, Sections 3 & 4):**  Maduramente failed to diligently and competently represent his client in Civil Case No. 6502-3, specifically by failing to attend the pre-trial conference and failing to meet filing deadlines.
*   **Fiduciary Duty (CPRA, Canon III, Section 6):**  Maduramente breached the fiduciary duty owed to his clients.
*   **Prohibition of Conflicting Interests (CPRA, Canon III, Section 13):**  Maduramente violated the rule against representing conflicting interests by representing both plaintiffs and intervenors in Civil Case No. 8506, whose legal positions were directly opposed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Impact on Client:** Palma's group suffered adverse judgment and lost the right to be heard in court due to the negligence.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Maduramente's actions reflect negatively on the legal profession.
*   **Future Disbarment Lifting:** The Court records both penalties due to his actions and they will be considered in the resolution of any request for judicial clemency.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **CPRA (A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC):** Governing ethical conduct of lawyers, including diligence, fiduciary duty, and conflict of interest rules.
*   *Spouses Niles v. Atty. Retardo, Jr.* (A.C. No. 13229):  Cited for the intentional violation of conflict of interest rules.
*   *Ko v. Maduramente* (A.C. No. 11118): Previous administrative liability is an aggravating circumstance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While Maduramente claimed his absence was due to being in Manila, his failure to file a motion for resetting the hearing and his failure to file pre-trial documents were points the court viewed very negatively.
* Maduramente previously ordered disbarred from the practice of law, per *Ko v. Maduramente.*

**Outcome:**

*   Maduramente found GUILTY of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and the Lawyer's Oath.
*   Suspension from the practice of law for one year for gross negligence and one year for intentional violation of the conflict of interest rules are *recorded* (but not imposed due to his prior disbarment).
*   A fine of PHP 110,000.00 is imposed for each offense, totaling PHP 220,000.00.
