## Legal Document Summary: People v. Villaros (G.R. No. 228779)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Affirming CA Decision; Affirming RTC Conviction for Rape)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of William Villaros for two counts of rape against a minor, AAA. The RTC and CA decisions were upheld, finding Villaros guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on the victim's testimony. The SC addressed and dismissed the accused-appellant's arguments regarding inconsistencies in the victim's testimony, delay in reporting, lack of resistance, and the absence of corroborating medical evidence.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Affirmed the conviction of Villaros for two counts of rape, violating Article 266-A 1 (a) & (b), in relation to Article 266-B, 1st paragraph of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 8353 and in further relation to Article 17.
*   **Elements of Rape:** The Court reiterated that the two elements of rape (carnal knowledge and use of force or intimidation) were present and sufficiently proven.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** The Court gave credence to the victim's detailed testimony, noting that a rape conviction can be based on the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the victim if it is clear, convincing, and consistent with human nature.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The accused-appellant's defense of alibi was dismissed as inherently weak and insufficient to overcome the victim's positive testimony. The Court noted that it was not physically impossible for the accused-appellant to be at the scene of the crime.
*   **Victim Blaming & "Exposure to Further Abuse" Argument:** The court emphatically rejected the accused-appellant's attempt to blame the victim for allegedly "exposing herself to further abuse" by remaining at the family home after the first rape.
*   **Lack of Resistance:** The Court emphasized that the law does not require proof of resistance from the victim in rape cases, especially in cases of familial or moral ascendancy.
*   **Medical Examination:** The Court reiterated that a medical examination is not indispensable in a prosecution for rape.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Villaros):** Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   **Accused-Appellant (Villaros):** Liable to pay the victim, AAA, P75,000 as civil indemnity, P75,000 as moral damages, and P75,000 as exemplary damages for each case, totaling P450,000 (previously P300,000 ordered by the CA and RTC), plus 6% interest per annum from the finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of Victim's Testimony:** Reliance on the victim's testimony alone, while permissible under existing jurisprudence, always carries some inherent risk of subjectivity, potentially exacerbated by the emotional context of rape cases.
*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** While the absence of corroborating medical evidence is not fatal, the lack thereof could have presented a vulnerability for the prosecution. The victim's account was apparently very compelling.
*   **No Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses**. There does not appear to be any obvious ambiguity in the legal document.
