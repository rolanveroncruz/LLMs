## Legal Document Summary: Gateway Electronics Corporation v. Asianbank Corporation

**Case:** G.R. No. 172041, December 18, 2008 (595 Phil. 353)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Gateway Electronics Corporation (Gateway) and Geronimo B. Delos Reyes, Jr.
*   **Respondent:** Asianbank Corporation (Asianbank)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC decision holding Gateway, Geronimo, and Andrew Delos Reyes jointly and severally liable to Asianbank for USD 2,235,452.17 plus interest, penalties, attorney's fees, and costs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deeds of Suretyship (July 23, 1996):** Geronimo and Andrew executed separate, almost identical deeds of suretyship in favor of Asianbank for Gateway's obligations up to *P*10,000,000.00 for the Domestic Bills Purchased Line and US$3,000,000.00 for the Omnibus Credit Line. These deeds contain a solidary, direct, and immediate liability clause, irrespective of remedies against the debtor (Gateway) and a waiver of notice from the creditor.  They also contain the phrase: evidenced by all notes, drafts, overdrafts and other [credit] obligations of every kind and nature contracted/incurred by said DEBTOR(S) in favor of said CREDITOR.
*   **Dollar Promissory Note (PN) No. FCD-0599-2749:**  Consolidated Gateway's export packing loans amounting to USD 1,700,883.48 and secured by a chattel mortgage.
*   **Extensions:** Asianbank extended the maturity dates of the loan obligations several times, with the conformity of certain Gateway officers.

**Obligations:**

*   **Gateway:** To repay the consolidated loan obligation (PN No. FCD-0599-2749) to Asianbank.
*   **Geronimo:** As surety, jointly and severally liable with Gateway for the amount of the Domestic Bills Purchased Line and Omnibus Credit Line, as evidenced by all notes, drafts, overdrafts and other credit obligations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Gateway:** Monetary liability to Asianbank for the outstanding debt. However, due to insolvency proceedings, execution of the CA judgment against Gateway must be pursued before the insolvency court (RTC, Branch 22, Imus, Cavite).
*   **Geronimo:** Solidarily liable with Gateway for the debt under the deeds of suretyship. The insolvency of Gateway does not absolve Geronimo of liability.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Continuing Suretyship:**  The Deeds of Suretyship are interpreted as continuing guarantees covering future loans within the description or contemplation of the contract. Geronimo contested this, arguing the suretyship was limited to the specific credit lines at the time of execution. *See Fortune Motors (Phils.) v. Court of Appeals* and *Diño vs. Court of Appeals*
*   **Waiver of Notice:** The Deed of Suretyship includes a waiver of notice of maturity or default, effectively precluding Geronimo from arguing that the loan extensions released him from his obligation. *Palmares v. Court of Appeals*
*   **Admission of Due Execution:** Geronimo's failure to specifically deny the genuineness and due execution of the Deed of Suretyship in his answer resulted in its implicit admission.
*   **Subrogation Rights:** Geronimo argued his right of subrogation was impaired by Gateway's insolvency. The court found his right was not negated, as this right may be exercised in the insolvency proceedings.
*   **Application of Garcia v. Court of Appeals:** Petitioners reliance on Garcia was found to be misplaced, as it applied to a specific loan document to the exclusion of another.
*   **Alleged deviation of Asianbank from normal banking practice:** Geronimo argued this released him from his obligations. The Court found that the delay or forbearance of Asianbank did not affect their rights vis-à-vis the surety.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 2047:** Defines suretyship.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1216:** Creditor can proceed against any of the solidary debtors.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2054:** Obligation of a guarantor may be less, but cannot be more than the obligation of the principal debtor.
*   **Act No. 1956 (Insolvency Law), Sec. 18 & 60:** Effects of an insolvency order and stay of actions against the insolvent.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 8, Sec. 7, 8, 10 & 11:** Pleading requirements for actions or defenses based on documents.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129, Sec. 4:** Judicial admissions.

**Case Law:**

*   **Palmares v. Court of Appeals:**  Discusses the nature of suretyship and creditor's rights.
*   **Fortune Motors (Phils.) v. Court of Appeals:**  Defines and upholds the validity of a continuing suretyship.
*   **Diño vs. Court of Appeals:** Discusses continuing guaranty/suretyship.
*   **Garcia v. Court of Appeals:** Demonstrates that where the contract specifies specific loans that it covers, that is what the agreement applies to, but, where the language includes "all notes, drafts" the the contract applies more broadly.
*   **Commercial Banking Corporation v. CA:** Surety of a distressed corporation can be sued separately despite suspension of payment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition. Geronimo remains liable as surety, and the case against him may proceed. The insolvency of Gateway requires that claims against it be pursued in the insolvency proceedings. A key challenge for Geronimo is the broad interpretation of the continuing suretyship and his waiver of notice of any loan extensions. The Court's decision hinged on the clear language of the Deed of Suretyship and Geronimo's failure to properly contest its execution.
