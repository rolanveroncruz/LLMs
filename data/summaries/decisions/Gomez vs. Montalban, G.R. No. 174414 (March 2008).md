## Legal Document Summary: *Gomez v. Montalban*, G.R. No. 174414, March 14, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing RTC Order granting Petition for Relief from Judgment and dismissing a collection case for lack of jurisdiction.

**Background:**

*   Petitioner (Gomez) sued Respondent (Montalban) in RTC for sum of money based on a P40,000 loan with 15% monthly interest.  Complaint alleged P238,000 due, including accumulated interest.
*   Respondent failed to answer; declared in default; RTC rendered judgment for Petitioner.
*   Respondent filed Petition for Relief from Judgment, claiming improper service of summons and lack of RTC jurisdiction as principal loan amount was only P40,000.
*   RTC initially dismissed the Petition for Relief due to Respondent's absence but reconsidered. Ultimately, the RTC granted the Petition for Relief, setting aside its earlier Decision and dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the RTC had jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held the amount claimed in the complaint (P238,000 including interest) determines jurisdiction, citing *Dionisio v. Puerto* 158 Phil. 671 (1974). The Court clarified that this is the controlling factor, not the amount ultimately proven at trial. The Court determined that based on Section 1(8) of RA 7691, amending BP Blg. 129, the RTC had proper jurisdiction due to the 238,000 demand.

2.  **Propriety of Relief from Judgment:** The Court ruled the Petition for Relief was improperly granted because:
    *   **Premature Filing:** A Petition for Relief under Rule 38 is only available against a final and executory judgment (*Aboitiz International Forwarders, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. 142272, 2 May 2006). The Respondent filed the petition *before* the 15-day period for a motion for reconsideration/appeal had lapsed.
    *   **No Valid Ground for Relief:**  Respondent argued "mistake or fraud" due to improper service. The Court clarified that "mistake" in Rule 38 refers to mistake of fact, not judicial error appealable (*Guevara v. Tuason and Co.*, 1 Phil. 27, 28 (1901)). "Fraud" must be extrinsic, preventing a fair trial (*Garcia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 96141, 2 October 1991). There was no evidence to support either claim.
    *   **Sufficiency of Service:** The Court held the sheriff's return is prima facie evidence of proper service (*Aboitiz International Forwarders, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, supra).

3.  **Remedies after Default:** The Court noted the Respondent failed to properly use the array of remedies available for the declaration of default, citing *Lina v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. L-63397, 9 April 1985.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent has a contractual obligation to repay the loan with interest.
*   Respondent is liable for the principal amount of the loan, accrued interest at a rate of 24% per annum, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The interest rate of 15% per month stated in the complaint is unconscionable and potentially void. The Court however did not address this and instead reduced to 24% annually. However, it is not clear if the court *can* make this determination during a relief from judgment. This needs to be considered when pursuing enforcement.
*   The original promissory note or loan agreement was not attached in the document. Without reviewing it, there may be other clauses or conditions that impact the enforceability of the loan.
*   While the decision reinstates the RTC's original judgment, collection may prove difficult if the Respondent lacks assets.
*   The RTC erroneously granted relief from judgment, and the correct remedy would have been for the Respondent to file a motion for reconsideration. 

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 38 of the Rules of Court (Relief from Judgment)
*   Rule 41 of the Rules of Court
*   Republic Act No. 7691 (Jurisdictional Amounts)
*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980)
*   *Dionisio v. Puerto* 158 Phil. 671 (1974)
*   *Aboitiz International Forwarders, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. 142272, 2 May 2006
*   *Guevara v. Tuason and Co.*, 1 Phil. 27, 28 (1901)
*   *Garcia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 96141, 2 October 1991
*   *Lina v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. L-63397, 9 April 1985

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly reversed the RTC's grant of relief from judgment. The RTC had jurisdiction, and the Respondent failed to establish valid grounds for relief and did not exhaust other available remedies. The original RTC judgment is reinstated.
