## Legal Document Summary: *Maria C. Osorio vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 207711

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed with modification the Court of Appeals' conviction of Maria C. Osorio for *Other Deceits* under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code, downgrading it from the original charge of Estafa under Article 315(2)(a).  Osorio, a Philam Life agent, induced Josefina Gabriel to invest P200,000 in "Philam Life Fund Management" promising a 20% annual return, with proceeds purportedly used to pay Gabriel's insurance premiums. Instead, Osorio diverted the funds to Philippine Money Investment Asset Management (PMIAM).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Original Charge:** Estafa under Art. 315(2)(a) RPC - False pretenses or fraudulent acts (using fictitious name, falsely pretending to possess power, etc.).
*   **Conviction:** Art. 318 RPC - Other Deceits (catch-all provision covering deceits not under Arts. 315, 316, and 317).
*   **Core Issue:** Whether Osorio's actions constituted Estafa under Art. 315(2)(a) RPC. The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Osorio used fictitious names, or falsely pretended to possess power, influence, agency, business, or imaginary transactions.
*   **Court's Reasoning:** While Osorio didn't meet the criteria for Art. 315(2)(a), she *did* falsely represent that the investment would be placed in Philam Life, inducing Gabriel to part with her money. This misrepresentation, though not a "similar deceit" to those enumerated in 315(2)(a) per the *ejusdem generis* principle (citing *Guinhawa v. People*), fell under the broader scope of Art. 318 RPC.
*   **Rule on Variance:** The Court applied the rule on variance under Rule 120, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (citing *Sales v. Court of Appeals*). Osorio was found guilty of "Other Deceits" a crime necessarily included in the crime of Estafa.

**Elements Proved for Art. 318 RPC:**

*   **False Pretense:** Misrepresentation that funds would be invested in Philam Life.
*   **Timing:** The misrepresentation occurred prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud (i.e., inducing Gabriel to hand over the money).
*   **Damage/Prejudice:** Gabriel's insurance policies lapsed, and she faced difficulty in recovering her investment.

**Obligations:**

*   Osorio is obligated to pay a fine of P200,000.00 to Gabriel.
*   Osorio is obligated to serve the penalty of two (2) months and (1) day to four (4) months of *arresto mayor*.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for other deceits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Court recognized that Osorio was not an agent for Philam Life, the company that Gabriel intended to invest in, but for PMIAM.
*   The Court considered Osorio's good faith argument but rejected it.
*   The Court did not accept Gabriel's argument that she consented to the change of investment, as she did not have an opportunity to make an informed decision.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Art. 315(2)(a), Art. 318
*   Rules of Court: Rule 45, Rule 120, Section 4
*   *Guinhawa v. People* - Discusses the principle of *ejusdem generis*.
*   *Aricheta v. People* - Discusses that in Estafa by means of deceit, that deceit consisting of false pretense or representation must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.
*   *MERALCO v. Atilano* - Discusses the nature of money market transactions and the corresponding liabilities that dealers may face when dealing with their client's investments.
*   *Sales v. Court of Appeals* - Discusses variance between allegation and proof.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was whether Osorio's actions constituted "other similar deceits" under Art. 315(2)(a). The court ultimately determined they did not, but did fall under the broader purview of Art. 318.
*   The issue of Gabriel's alleged consent to the PMIAM investment was contentious, with the Court finding a lack of genuine consent.
