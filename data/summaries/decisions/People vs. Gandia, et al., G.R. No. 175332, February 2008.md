## Legal Document Summary: People v. Gandia, G.R. No. 175332

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Damaso Gandia, et al. (G.R. No. 175332, February 6, 2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting six accused of murder.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), qualified by treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength.
*   **Facts:** Victim Louie Albuero was fatally stabbed following an altercation at a pub owned by Damaso Gandia. Multiple accused participated in the stabbing.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted all six accused of murder, sentencing Damaso Gandia, Jerry Ramirez, Renato Olleres, Dante Gandia and Joel Gonzales to Reclusion Perpetua. Ernesto Calaripio, a minor, received a sentence of 6 years and 1 day to 8 years of Prision Mayor. All were ordered to jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the victim for P50,000 and funeral expenses (P30,844).
*   **Accused Withdrawals:** Damaso Gandia, Jerry Ramirez, and Dante Gandia withdrew their appeals; therefore, the RTC decision became final and executory for them. Separate Entries of Judgement were made for each of them.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the conviction but acquitted Ernesto Calaripio. Ordered *all* accused (including those who withdrew their appeals) to pay additional exemplary damages of P25,000.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision *with modification*. The Supreme Court agreed with the CA in finding appellants Olleres and Gonzales guilty of murder. However, SC held that the CA erred in ordering Damaso, Ramirez and Dante (who withdrew their appeals) to pay exemplary damages. The RTC judgement on these three had already become final and executory. Modified the CA ruling to specify that only Renato Olleres and Joel Gonzales were liable for exemplary damages. Section 11, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court (Effect of appeal by any of several accused) was cited to support this point.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Renato Olleres and Joel Gonzales: Joint and several liability for death indemnity (P50,000.00), funeral expenses (P30,844.00), and exemplary damages (P25,000.00).
*   Damaso Gandia, Jerry Ramirez, and Dante Gandia: Liable as per the original RTC decision (death indemnity and funeral expenses), but not exemplary damages.
*   The State: Obligation to ensure the imprisonment terms of the convicts are fulfilled as per the final judgements.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Specificity of Treachery Allegation:** Appellants argued that the information did not specifically allege treachery, potentially reducing the liability to homicide. CA and SC disagreed with this contention.
*   **Erroneous Inclusion in CA Decision:** The CA erroneously included Damaso Gandia, Jerry Ramirez, and Dante Gandia (who withdrew their appeals) in the order for exemplary damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure: Sections 8 and 9.
*   Rules of Court: Section 11, Rule 122 (Effect of appeal by any of several accused)
*   *People v. Mateo* (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004): Established intermediate review by the Court of Appeals in cases where the penalty imposed is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.
*   *People v. Medrano* (207 Phil. 516 (1983)): Supported the Supreme Court's action to delete reference to an accused who did not file an appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The initial lack of clarity in the Information regarding the specification of the qualifying circumstances of treachery, though resolved against the appellants, posed a potential point of contention. Also, the CA mistakenly ordering those who withdrew their appeal to pay exemplary damages.
