## Legal Document Summary: *Salao v. Court of Appeals and Apolonio*, G.R. No. 107725 (1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court decision awarding damages for physical injuries.

**Facts:** Private Respondent, Apolonio, sued Petitioner, Salao, for damages, alleging that Salao inflicted head injuries on him with a gun. Salao claimed self-defense. The RTC ruled in favor of Apolonio, and the CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Award of Damages:** The RTC ordered Salao to pay Apolonio P20,000 (actual), P10,000 (moral), and P15,000 (attorney's fees). The CA affirmed this award.
*   **Proof of Damages:** The Court found that the award of actual damages was supported by the medical bills/receipts presented by Apolonio (Exhibits D, D-1 to D-13).
*   **Moral Damages:** Awarded under Art. 2219(1) or (2) of the Civil Code (physical injuries resulting from a crime or quasi-delict).
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded under Art. 2208(2) of the Civil Code, as Apolonio was compelled to litigate due to Salao's actions.
*   **Lack of Prior Conciliation:** Salao raised, but unsuccessfully, the issue that Apolonio failed to undergo conciliation proceedings as required by PD 1508 before filing suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   Salao is liable for the actual, moral, and attorney's fees awarded to Apolonio.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Acquittal in Criminal Case:** Salao argued that his acquittal in a related criminal case for serious physical injuries should absolve him of civil liability. The Court rejected this argument, citing Art. 33 of the Civil Code, which allows for a separate and independent civil action for physical injuries based on *quasi-delict*, requiring only a preponderance of evidence. *Heirs of Guaring v. Court of Appeals* is cited to support the argument.
*   **Factual Findings Affirmed:** The Court heavily relied on the factual findings of the trial court, which were affirmed by the Court of Appeals, making it difficult to overturn on appeal. The petitioner needs to show these factual findings were without basis.
*   **Issues Not Raised in the Lower Courts:** The Supreme Court refused to address issues (propriety of damage awards and effect of acquittal) raised for the first time on appeal. This highlights the importance of raising all relevant arguments at the trial level.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 33, Civil Code:** Separate and independent civil action for physical injuries.
*   **Art. 2219, Civil Code:** Moral damages in case of physical injuries from crime or quasi-delict.
*   **Art. 2208(2), Civil Code:** Attorney's fees when defendant's act compels plaintiff to litigate.
*   **Rule 111, ยง2(b), Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Extinction of penal action doesn't extinguish civil action unless the judgment declares the facts from which the civil action could arise did not exist.
*   **Rule 132, ยง20, Revised Rules on Evidence:** Proof of private document.
*   *Abella v. Court of Appeals, 257 SCRA 482 (1996)*; *Lopez Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 247 SCRA 183 (1995)*; *National Power Corp. v. Gutierrez, 193 SCRA 1 (1991)* - Establishes the rule that issues not raised *a quo* cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.
*   *Heirs of Guaring v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 108395, March 7, 1997*; *Padilla v. Court of Appeals, 129 SCRA 558 (1984)*; *Gula v. Dianala, 132 SCRA 245 (1984)*; *Tayag v. Alcantara, 98 SCRA 723 (1980)* - Affirms the separability of the civil action from the criminal action.
*   *PD 1508* - Requirement of conciliation proceedings.

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   The core contention is the determination of whether the lower courts appropriately applied the law of *quasi-delict* and properly assessed the evidence in awarding damages, despite the acquittal in the criminal case.

**Overall:** The Court upheld the lower courts' decision, emphasizing factual findings, reliance on documented evidence, and the independent nature of the civil action. The acquittal in the criminal case did not affect the liability in the quasi-delict case.
