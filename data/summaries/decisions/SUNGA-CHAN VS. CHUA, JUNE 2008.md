Okay, here is a concise legal summary of *Lilibeth Sunga-Chan and Cecilia Sunga vs. The Honorable Court of Appeals; The Honorable Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 11, Sindangan, Zamboanga Del Norte; The Regional Trial Court Sheriff, Branch 11, Sindangan, Zamboanga Del Norte; The Clerk Of Court Of Manila, As Ex-Officio Sheriff; And Lamberto T. Chua*.

**Case Summary: *Lilibeth Sunga-Chan and Cecilia Sunga vs. Lamberto T. Chua*, G.R. No. 164401, June 25, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's resolution approving the computation of claims in a case for winding up of partnership affairs, accounting, and recovery of shares.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Partnership Winding Up:** The core issue revolves around the proper accounting and winding up of a partnership (Shellite Gas Appliance Center) formed between Chua and the deceased Jacinto Sunga.  The Sunga heirs (petitioners) continued the business after Jacinto's death without Chua's consent.
*   **RTC Judgment (Final and Executory):** The original RTC decision, upheld by the CA and the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 143340), ordered the petitioners to:
    *   Render an accounting of the partnership assets, income, and profits since Jacinto's death.
    *   Restitute misapplied partnership assets and pay Chua his Â½ share.
    *   Pay Chua earned but unreceived income and profits of P35,000/month from 1988-1992, with legal interest.
    *   Wind up the partnership affairs and terminate business activities, delivering Chua's share or its value.
    *   Pay Chua moral/exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.
*   **Accounting Dispute:** The primary contention involves the accuracy of the accounting and the imposition of interest on the sums due to Chua. Petitioners contest the approved computation of claims, arguing that certain items were unliquidated and should not bear interest. They also claim that the amount was excessive.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** The Supreme Court held that petitioners' liability to Chua is solidary.  This is due to the nature of their actions in continuing the business without Chua's consent, making it impossible to differentiate their individual liability.
*   **Community Property:**  The Court held that the absolute community property of Lilibeth Sunga-Chan and her husband could be held liable for her obligations arising from the judgment, to the extent that the family benefitted, referencing Article 94 of the Family Code.
*   **Interest:**
    *   Pre-Judgment: The Court partially adjusted the interest calculations based on the principles established in *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* and *Reformina v. Tomol, Jr.*
        *   Unremitted profits from 1988-1992: 6% per annum from the RTC decision date (October 7, 1997) until finality (December 20, 2001), then 12% per annum until fully paid.
        *   Goodwill, damages, fees: 12% per annum from finality (December 20, 2001) until fully paid.
        *   Partnership Assets: The Court held that Chua's share of the partnership assets was an unliquidated claim until the RTC approved the inventory and accounting on November 6, 2002. As the submission was only on October 15, 2002, then no interest can be added.
    *   Post-Judgment: The Court found that post-judgment interest is applied at 12% due to forbearance of credit.
*   **Overpayment:** The Supreme Court found that Chua overpaid Sunga-Chan by PhP 2,470,607.48 as a result of the auction sale of her property.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation of Assets:** The valuation of the partnership assets remains a potential point of contention, even after the Court's adjustments.  Determining the fair market value and ensuring accurate accounting are crucial.
*   **Enforcement Issues:** The enforcement of the judgment and the writ of possession could be subject to further delays or legal challenges, particularly concerning the remaining property and the distribution of the excess amount from the sale.
*   **Disagreement as to application of the Court's formula:** Dispute may arise from how the Court's formula is to be applied, particularly for matters of calculation.
*   **Application of *Eastern Shipping Lines*** The application of *Eastern Shipping Lines* concerning the nature of pre-judgment interest.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA (G.R. No. 97412):**  Defines rules for imposing legal interest rates on loans/forbearance of money vs. other obligations.
*   **Reformina v. Tomol, Jr. (No. L-59096):**  Clarifies that 12% interest under CB Circular No. 416 applies *only* to loans or forbearance of money.
*   **Article 2209, Civil Code:** Prescribes 6% yearly interest for obligations involving payment of indemnities/damages when there's no stipulation to the contrary.
*   **Article 2213, Civil Code:** Addresses interest on unliquidated claims.
*   **Articles 1207, Civil Code:** Addresses Solidary Liability.
