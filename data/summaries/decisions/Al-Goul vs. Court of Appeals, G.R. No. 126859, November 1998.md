**Legal Document Summary - *Al-Ghoul v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126859 (1998)***

**Nature:** Resolution regarding a Motion for Clarification or Partial Lifting of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on a Motion for Bail.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Original Charges:** Petitioners were charged with illegal possession of firearms, ammunition, and explosives under Sections 1 and 3 of Presidential Decree No. 1866 (PD 1866).
*   **Motion for Bail:** Petitioners filed a motion for bail in the trial court, which was initially denied based on the severity of the potential penalty (reclusion perpetua) and the perceived strength of the prosecution's evidence.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial court's denial of bail.
*   **SC TRO:** The Supreme Court (SC) issued a TRO enjoining the trial court from proceeding with the criminal trial.
*   **RA 8294 Amendment:** Republic Act No. 8294 amended PD 1866, reducing the penalties for the offenses charged.
*   **Current Motion:** Petitioners filed a motion to partially lift the TRO to allow the trial court to hear their motion for bail, given the reduced penalties under RA 8294.
*   **OSG Position:** The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) did not object to the partial lifting of the TRO, acknowledging that the reduced penalties entitle petitioners to bail as a matter of right prior to conviction.
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC granted the motion to partially lift the TRO, ordering the trial court to proceed with the hearing of the motion for bail and resolve it with dispatch.

**Obligations:**

*   **Trial Court:** Obligated to conduct a hearing on the motion for bail and resolve it expeditiously.

**Liabilities:**

*   The risk of continued detention if bail is not granted after the hearing.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The trial court could still deny bail after the hearing if it finds that, despite the reduced penalties, other factors weigh against granting bail.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1866 (PD 1866):** Original statute under which the petitioners were charged.
*   **Republic Act No. 8294 (RA 8294):** Amendment to PD 1866, reducing the penalties for illegal possession of firearms, ammunition, and explosives. *Section 1 (par. 2), R.A. 8294. Section 2(par. 1), R.A. 8294.*
*   **Rule 114, Section 6 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended by Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 12-94.**
*   **SC Administrative Circular No. 12-94, Section 4:**  Provides for bail as a matter of right before conviction for offenses not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "strength of evidence" may still influence the court's decision on bail, even with the reduced penalties.  The trial court's initial assessment that the evidence of guilt was strong could be revisited in the bail hearing.

**Note:** This summary focuses on the bail issue and the impact of RA 8294. The underlying issues of the validity of the search warrants and admissibility of evidence, while initially contested, are not directly addressed in this resolution.
