*   **Number of Rape Counts:**  Despite evidence suggesting multiple acts, the accused was convicted of only *one* count of rape because the Information only charged one offense.  The decision cites *People v. De Guzman* to reinforce the accused’s constitutional right to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him.
