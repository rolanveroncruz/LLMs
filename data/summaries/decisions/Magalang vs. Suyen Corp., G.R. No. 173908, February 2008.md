**Case Summary: Magalang v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 173908 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 79408 regarding illegal dismissal.

**Facts:** Eleanor Magalang, Account Executive at Suyen Corporation, was terminated for alleged falsification of transportation reimbursement requests. She claimed she was dismissed for union activities. LA dismissed her complaint. NLRC reversed, finding illegal dismissal but denied backwages. Two CA divisions then issued conflicting rulings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** NLRC initially ruled illegal dismissal but denied backwages. CA-G.R. SP No. 75185 affirmed illegal dismissal and awarded full backwages. This decision became final.
*   **Reinstatement & Backwages:** CA-G.R. SP No. 75185 ordered reinstatement with full backwages. G.R. No. 173908 affirmed with modification to follow the decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185 by ordering Suyen Corporation to pay Eleanor C. Magalang full backwages from the time of her illegal dismissal up to actual reinstatement.
*   **Employer Obligations:** Suyen Corporation is obligated to reinstate Magalang and pay full backwages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Suyen Corporation is liable for backwages to Magalang due to illegal dismissal. The amount is determined by the period from dismissal to actual reinstatement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Execution:** Failure to comply with the final order can lead to execution proceedings against Suyen Corporation.
*   **Contempt:** Non-compliance may result in contempt of court proceedings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294 (formerly Article 279) of the Labor Code:** Implied, regarding reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Villaflores v. RAM System Services, Inc., G.R. No. 166136, August 18, 2006:** Addressed the importance of judicial stability and how divisions in the CA are coordinate courts
*   **Macawiag v. Balindong, G.R. No. 159210, September 20, 2006:** Addressed when a decision becomes final and executory, the court loses jurisdiction over the case and not even an appellate court will have the power to review the said judgment.
*   **Silliman University v. Nanila Fontelo-Paalan, G.R. No. 170948, June 26, 2007:** Addressed that just as the losing party has the privilege to file an appeal within the prescribed period, so does the winner have the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the decision.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial conflict between the NLRC's denial of backwages and the subsequent award by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185 created ambiguity. The Supreme Court clarified this by affirming and modifying the decision to follow CA-G.R. SP No. 75185 which had already attained finality.

**Key Takeaway:** The final and executory judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 75185, which awarded backwages, is controlling. The Supreme Court's decision enforces this finality, obligating Suyen Corporation to both reinstate Magalang and pay her full backwages.
