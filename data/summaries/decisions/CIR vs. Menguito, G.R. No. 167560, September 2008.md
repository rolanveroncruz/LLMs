Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Dominador Menguito*, G.R. No. 167560, September 17, 2008

**Legal Issue:** Whether Dominador Menguito is liable for deficiency income and percentage taxes for 1991-1993, and whether the assessments were validly issued.

**Facts:**

*   Menguito operated a restaurant/cafeteria business under the name "Copper Kettle Cafeteria Specialist" (CKCS) with branches, including one at Club John Hay, Baguio.
*   The BIR assessed Menguito deficiency taxes based on undeclared income from Texas Instruments and Club John Hay.
*   Menguito argued that the income belonged to "Copper Kettle Catering Services, Inc." (CKCS, Inc.), a separate corporation owned by his wife, Jeanne Menguito.
*   The CA reversed the CTA's ruling in favor of the CIR, holding that CKCS and CKCS, Inc. were distinct entities.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the CTA decision.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The Court disregarded the separate corporate identities of CKCS and CKCS, Inc., treating them as one taxable entity. This was justified because of substantial evidence showing:
    *   Commingling of operations and control.
    *   Jeanne Menguito's letters indicating control over both businesses (e.g., referring to "our business" at Club John Hay and Texas Instruments).
    *   Tax returns identifying "Copper Kettle Cafeteria Specialist" at “19th Tee Camp John Hay” when Club John Hay records indicated that the COPPER KETTLE CATERING SERVICES operates the outlet.
*   **Tax Assessment Validity:** The Court ruled that the formal assessment notices were validly issued, as prescribed by Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code.
    *   The assessment notices were timely issued under Section 223 of the Tax Code (10-year period for fraud).
    *   The address used on the assessment notices was the address of record in the taxpayers return.
    *   The taxpayer was estopped from denying receipt of the notices, given the petition for review and acknowledgement in a protest letter.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** While the CIR failed to prove that it served the taxpayer a post-reporting notice and a pre-assessment notice, the absence of these notices did not invalidate the assessment under Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code which was in effect at the time of assessment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 223 of the Tax Code:** (Prescription for Assessment of Deficiency Taxes)
*   **Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code:** (Assessment procedure, in effect at time of assessment)

**Potential Risks:**

*   The potential commingling of business and personal finances could result in the assessment of personal finances.

**Case Law Applied:**

*   The Supreme Court relied on established jurisprudence regarding piercing the corporate veil, citing *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Norton and Harrison Company, No. L-17618, August 31, 1964, 11 SCRA 714* and *Liddell & Co., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 112 Phil. 524 (1961)*.
