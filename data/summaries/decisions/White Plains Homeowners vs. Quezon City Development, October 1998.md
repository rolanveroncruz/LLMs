## Legal Document Summary: *White Plains Homeowners Association, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and the Quezon City Development & Financing Corporation* (G.R. No. 128131, October 8, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review involving a dispute over an undeveloped strip of land (Road Lot 1) within White Plains Subdivision, Quezon City.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** White Plains Homeowners Association, Inc. (Association)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals and Quezon City Development & Financing Corporation (QCDFC)

**Background:** This case is the third involving these parties, stemming from QCDFC's initial development of White Plains. The dispute centers on an 18-meter wide strip of land, Road Lot 1, initially intended for a 38-meter wide thoroughfare (Highway 38, later C-5). The original plan to construct C-5 through Road Lot 1 was abandoned, leaving the strip undeveloped. The Association has been collecting "special occupancy dues" from garden operators occupying the undeveloped land, prompting QCDFC to seek an injunction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Plan:** QCDFC, as the subdivision developer, set aside a 38-meter wide strip of land as Road Lot 1 for the proposed Highway 38/C-5 thoroughfare, as required by the National Planning Commission.
*   **Limited Development:** QCDFC only developed a 20-meter portion of Road Lot 1 into a street for subdivision access. The remaining 18-meter strip remains undeveloped.
*   **Exclusion from Donation:** Road Lot 1 was specifically excluded from the donation of subdivision roads to Quezon City.
*   **Lien/Reservation:** Previous court decisions (G.R. No. 55868, G.R. No. 95522) ordered title to Road Lot 1 to remain with QCDFC but with a lien/reservation annotated for the construction of Highway 38/C-5.
*   **Abandoned Project:** The national government abandoned the plan to construct C-5 through Road Lot 1, rendering the original purpose of the reservation moot.
*   **Current Ruling:** The Supreme Court dismissed the Association's petition, lifted the reservation/lien on Road Lot 1, and restored full ownership rights, including development and rental collection, to QCDFC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Association Liability:** The Association is prohibited from collecting rentals from the garden operators.
*   **QCDFC Liability:** While awarded full ownership, QCDFC could face future eminent domain proceedings if Quezon City desires to use the land for another public purpose, requiring the payment of just compensation. The question is, as no case law is referenced in the document for the use of donation.
*   **Misrepresentation Claims:** A risk exists that previous homeowners may have been told that they would have this road built on their property, and may attempt to sue.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***G.R. No. 55868, White Plains Association, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Quezon City Development & Financing Corporation:*** Established that Road Lot 1 was withdrawn from commerce of man and should be developed for the use of the general public.
*   ***G.R. No. 95522, White Plains Association, Inc. vs. Hon. Godofredo Legaspi:*** Reiterated that Road Lot 1 was withdrawn from commerce of man, constituting it as part of mandatory open space reserved for public use.
*   ***Young vs. City of Manila, 73 Phil. 538:*** Plaintiff cannot compel the defendant City of Manila to purchase from him the street areas described in his complaint. Neither can he be compelled to donate said land and transfer his title to the city so that the latter may build and maintain the streets.
*   **P.D. 957, Section 31:** Registered owner/developer may, at their option, donate roads and open spaces upon project completion.
*   **P.D. 1216, Section 2:** Owner/developer has the option of donating to either the Homeowners Association or the local government.
*   **Article 764 of the Civil Code:** The Court references Article 764, but does not clearly set forth if this would have effect on this case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **"Beyond the Commerce of Man" Dictum:** While previous rulings stated that Road Lot 1 was "beyond the commerce of man," the Supreme Court now seems to qualify this, allowing QCDFC to exercise full ownership rights due to the abandoned C-5 project and the exclusion of Road Lot 1 from the city's donation.
*   **Res Judicata:** The Association argued res judicata based on prior decisions. The Court rejected this argument, citing supervening events (abandonment of C-5) and the fact that previous rulings left certain issues unresolved.
*   **Forcible Donation:** The Supreme Court finds forcible donation against the owner's will to be invalid, especially when the road was intended for a national highway that was abandoned.
*   **The Court used City Council Resolution No. 7591, S-68, dated June 3, 1968, to support that QCDFC was donating to the city. However, this would have been a city council resolution approving the donation, not the donation itself.

**Potential Risks:**

1.  This ruling could open the door to future litigation if the local government determines the land should be used for another purpose and would be entitled to just compensation.

2.  There is a risk of claims from homeowners who were told that the road would be built on the subject property.

**Conclusion:**

This decision significantly alters the previous understanding of Road Lot 1's status. While past rulings emphasized its dedication to public use, the abandonment of the C-5 project and the lack of a formal donation have led the Supreme Court to restore full ownership rights to QCDFC.
