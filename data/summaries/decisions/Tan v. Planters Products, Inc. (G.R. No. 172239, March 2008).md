**Legal Document Summary: _Conchita Tan v. Planters Products, Inc._ (G.R. No. 172239)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a specific performance action for renewal of lease contracts.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Conchita Tan (Marman Trading), Lessee
*   **Respondent:** Planters Products, Inc. (PPI), Lessor

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in reversing the RTC's order compelling PPI to execute new lease contracts based on the renewal option in the original lease agreements.

**Facts:**

*   Two 10-year lease contracts (sulfuric acid and ammonium tanks) between Marman and PPI with identical renewal clauses: Lessee has option to renew for 10 years under terms agreed upon, provided 180 days written notice is given.
*   Marman gave timely notice of intent to renew.
*   PPI made a counter-offer with changed terms (shorter lease period, increased fees, minimum volume, and new conditions regarding repairs and relocations).
*   Marman urged adherence to the original 10-year renewal period but was willing to discuss other points.
*   Parties discussed counter-offer terms, specifically the increase of fees. No agreement was reached on non-commercial terms such as pipeline relocation and dock repairs.
*   PPI later expressed reluctance to renew due to alleged breaches of original contracts (maintenance, overextended pipeline) but stood firm on its counter-offer terms.
*   Marman sued for specific performance, seeking execution of new 10-year lease contracts.

**RTC Ruling:** Granted summary judgment to Marman, ordering PPI to renew the leases for 10 years based on an agreed escalation rate, awarding exemplary damages and attorney's fees.  RTC held the 10-year renewal was pre-agreed.

**CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC order for specific performance, dismissing Marman's complaint. CA reasoned that there was no perfected contract because the parties had not agreed on all material terms of the renewal, especially since the letter of November 8, 2002 expressed an intent to enter into a lease contract only once all conditions were met. CA affirmed the RTC dismissal of PPI's counterclaims, because a permissible counterclaim requires the payment of docket fees to vest jurisdiction to hear the counterclaim.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Renewal Clause:** Lessee's option to renew for 10 years under terms and conditions agreed upon by both parties.
*   **Notice Requirement:** Lessee must give 180 days written notice of intent to renew.
*   The renewal of the original lease is subject to "terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the parties."
*   Under Art. 1318 of the Civil Code, there is no contract unless there is consent of the contracting parties.
*   It is clear that the renewal of the lease is not automatic. The parties will still negotiate and bargain on the terms and conditions of the new contract.
*   Commercial terms of the contract - rents, variable fees, and escalation rates.
*   Non-commercial terms of the contract - covenants to fix and repair the leased premises.
*   The notice only triggers the parties to negotiate on the terms and conditions of the renewal. If the parties fail to agree on all terms and conditions of the new contract, there is no perfected new contract as between them.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **No Perfected Contract:** Because of the lack of full agreement, there is no perfected new lease contract, and PPI cannot be compelled to execute one.
*   **Estoppel:** Marman is estopped from claiming that the non-commercial terms are not essential, due to its prior communication.
*   **For PPI:** Potential liability arises if there were detrimental reliance by Marman or if there was conduct showing unequivocal assent to all renewal terms.
*   **No jurisdiction:** The lower court lacked jurisdiction to hear the PPIâ€™s counterclaim because PPI failed to pay the requisite docket fees.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1318 and 1319 regarding the essential elements of a contract (consent).
*   **Rule 44, Section 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Procedural defect in Appellant's brief.
*   **_Barnes v. Padilla_:** Technical rules should not hinder substantial justice.
*   **_A. Magsaysay, Inc. v. Cebu Portland Cement Co._:** Agreement must extend to all material points for a contract to be perfected.
*   **_Leonardo v. Court of Appeals_:** Consent must extend to all material points.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the renewal clause itself is the core contention. Specifically, whether "terms and conditions as may be agreed upon" refers to ALL terms or only certain key commercial terms. The Court interprets it to encompass all terms deemed material by either party.

**Summary of Key Legal Arguments:**

*   **Marman:** Argued a perfected contract existed upon agreement on commercial terms, and that the ten-year term was pre-agreed upon.
*   **PPI:** Argued no contract existed due to lack of agreement on all terms.
*   **Court:** The Supreme Court sided with PPI. The Court emphasizes that parties clearly intended that there be an agreement on ALL points being discussed before there could be a renewal.

**Implications:** The case highlights that a renewal option, even with a fixed term, does not guarantee renewal if material terms remain unagreed upon. It affirms that courts will respect the parties' intent to require mutual agreement on all material elements for a contract to be perfected.
