**Legal Document Summary: People v. Del Prado (G.R. No. 187074)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Allan del Prado was charged with murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, for the death of Anthony Hudo, alleging conspiracy and abuse of superior strength.
*   **Witness Testimony (Sheryll Ann Tubigan):** Key witness identifying Del Prado as stabbing the victim, corroborated by Medico-Legal Officer Dr. Freyra's autopsy findings.
*   **Defense:** Del Prado claimed he was merely present and fled the scene.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Del Prado guilty of murder, sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, and ordered him to pay actual and moral damages.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision with modifications, increasing civil indemnity and awarding temperate damages.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Convicted of murder, resulting in *reclusion perpetua* imprisonment.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: P50,000
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000
    *   Temperate Damages: P25,000 (in lieu of actual damages)
    *   Exemplary Damages: P30,000

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Del Prado challenged the credibility of Tubigan's testimony, claiming it was contrary to human experience (i.e., victim's friends not immediately assisting). The court rejected this argument, citing *People v. Tio* and similar cases regarding varied human reactions in frightful situations and deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility per *People v. Deunida*.
*   **Qualifying Circumstance (Abuse of Superior Strength):** The conviction hinges on abuse of superior strength, evidenced by the number of assailants, nature of weapons used, and coordinated attack. Del Prado argued against the applicability of this circumstance, but the Court affirmed it based on the inequality of force and intent to ensure the victim's death.
*   **Lack of Treachery/Premeditation:** Del Prado argued that the prosecution failed to prove treachery or premeditation. However, the court clarified that the Information did not allege treachery, and the conviction was based on abuse of superior strength, rendering this argument moot.
*   **Prosecution's Choice of Witnesses:** Del Prado questioned why all witnesses present at the scene were not presented. The court cited *People v. Jumamoy*, asserting the prosecutor's prerogative to choose witnesses needed to meet the quantum of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
    *   The testimonies of the other witnesses may, therefore, be dispensed with for being merely corroborative in nature.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Article 2206, Civil Code:** Authorizes civil indemnity for death caused by a crime. *People v. Callet, People v. Muñez*, et al. establishes the current indemnity at P50,000.
*   **Article 2230, Civil Code:** Allows exemplary damages when the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.
*   **People v. Teehankee, Jr.:** Lists factors for determining the credibility of a witness' identification.
*   **People v. Tio, People v. Merino, People v. Rubio:** Explains the varied reactions of humans when confronted with a frightful experience.
*   **People v. Deunida, People v. Acuña:** States that the trial court's determination of the issue of the credibility of witnesses and its consequent findings of fact must be given great weight and respect on appeal
*   **People v. Jumamoy:** Affirms the prosecutor's discretion in selecting witnesses.
*   **People v. Dela Cruz:** Justifies the award of temperate damages when actual damages proven are less than P25,000.
*   **People v. Catubig, People v. Beltran, Jr., People v. Gidoc, People v. Anguac, People v. Layco, Sr.:** Establish Jurisprudence for determining the circumstances under which exemplary damages must be awarded

**Ambiguities:**

*   None apparent in the court's analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Del Prado's appeal, affirming his murder conviction based on the witness's credible testimony and the finding of abuse of superior strength. The Court also adjusted the civil damages, including an award for exemplary damages. Del Prado's challenges to the evidence and the qualifying circumstance were rejected.
