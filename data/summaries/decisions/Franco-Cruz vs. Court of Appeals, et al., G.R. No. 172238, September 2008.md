**Case Summary: *Ma. Liza Franco-Cruz v. Court of Appeals, Victory Liner, et al.*, G.R. No. 172238 (2008)**

**Facts:** This case involves a vehicular accident where a Franco Transit bus collided with Victory Liner vehicles, resulting in fatalities and damages. Victory Liner and the surviving spouses of deceased individuals filed a complaint for damages against Ma. Liza Franco-Cruz, alleging she was the registered owner and operator of Franco Transit and negligent in the selection/supervision of the driver.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** Franco-Cruz denies ownership of the Franco Transit bus, presenting a Certificate of Registration in the name of Felicisima R. Franco. This challenges her status as the real party-in-interest and the lack of cause of action against her.
*   **Default Order & Due Process:** Franco-Cruz was declared in default for failing to appear at pre-trial. The RTC denied her motion for reconsideration, erroneously citing the lack of an affidavit of merit (unnecessary since defenses were already in the answer). The Supreme Court considered this a deprivation of due process.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** Franco-Cruz's motion for reconsideration was filed late, leading the CA to dismiss her appeal as the trial court decision was final and executory. However, a partial motion for reconsideration was filed on time by a co-plaintiff, so this ruling of finality was an error.
*   **Negligence Claim:** The plaintiffs are claiming that the defendant failed to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of the driver of the Franco Transit bus.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The defendant alleges that the proximate cause of the collision was the negligence and recklessness of a third party, the driver of a Philippine Rabbit bus.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Vicarious Liability (Art. 2180, Civil Code):** Plaintiffs claim Franco-Cruz is vicariously liable for the negligence of the bus driver, as owner/operator. *Potential Risk: If Franco-Cruz is found to be the owner/operator, she faces liability for damages resulting from the driver's negligence.*
*   **Direct Liability (Negligence):** Plaintiffs also claim Franco-Cruz was directly negligent in selecting/supervising the driver. *Potential Risk: If the plaintiffs can prove that the Defendant failed to vet and supervise the driver, the Defendant is at risk.*
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded significant damages, including actual damages, lost income, moral damages, and attorney's fees. *Financial Risk: Depending on the ultimate finding of liability and evidence presented, the financial risk is high.*

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 2180, Civil Code:** Establishes vicarious liability of employers for the acts of their employees. This is crucial for establishing the Defendant's liability.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 37, Section 1; Rule 41, Section 3:** Governs the timelines for filing motions for reconsideration and appeals. *Testate Estate of Manuel v. Biascan*, 401 Phil. 49 (2000), discussed finality of judgements.
*   **Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Far East Molasses Corporation, G.R. No. 89125, 198 SCRA 689 (1991):** Confirms that each party has a separate appeal period.
*   **Rule 130, Section 44 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the admissibility of entries in official records as prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. *Africa, et al. v. Caltex (Phil.), Inc., et al.,* 123 Phil. 272, 277 (1966), clarified this point.
*   **Saguid v. Court of Appeals, 451 Phil. 825, 837 (2003):** The burden of proof rests upon the party who asserts an affirmative issue.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Determination of Ownership/Operation:** The central issue is the ownership/operation of the bus. The Traffic Accident Report identifying Franco-Cruz as the registered owner is challenged by the Certificate of Registration in another person's name. Establishing the identity of the true owner/operator is paramount.
*   **Impact of Third Party Negligence:** The allegation that the Philippine Rabbit bus driver caused the collision is contentious. The trial court didn't consider this due to having declared her "as in default". It might reduce or eliminate her negligence.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, SET ASIDE the CA decision, VACATED the RTC decision, and REMANDED the case to the RTC. The RTC was ordered to allow Franco-Cruz to present evidence on her affirmative defenses (ownership) and to rebut the plaintiffs' evidence and to allow the Plaintiffs to present evidence on such.

**Legal Strategy:**

The Supreme Court has provided the Defendant with a second opportunity to present evidence and defend herself. The Plaintiff may have to submit additional evidence to buttress their claim.
