**Case Summary: People v. Pascua, G.R. No. 227707 (October 8, 2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs â€“ *shabu*).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and RTC decisions, acquitting the accused based on reasonable doubt due to a failure to comply with the Chain of Custody Rule under Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Jerome Pascua was charged with illegal sale of 0.0154 grams of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, based on a buy-bust operation. Co-accused Manilyn Pompay Remedios was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.
*   **Buy-Bust:** A buy-bust operation was conducted after a tip regarding the accused's alleged drug sales. PO2 Sulmerin acted as the poseur-buyer and purchased *shabu* from the accused.
*   **Inventory & Chain of Custody:** The inventory of seized items was conducted in the presence of the accused, Manilyn, a media representative, and a Chief Tanod. No DOJ representative or elected public official (other than the Tanod who was not considered an eligible elected official).
*   **Trial Court:** RTC convicted the accused for illegal sale of *shabu* but acquitted both accused of possession of paraphernalia due to an illegal search.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court:** Reversed the conviction.

**Legal Analysis & Risks:**

*   **Chain of Custody Rule (Section 21, RA 9165):** The Court focused on the requirement of having *three* specific witnesses (accused or representative, media representative, and representatives from the DOJ and any elected public official) present during the physical inventory and photographing of seized drugs. *People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018*, and *People v. Umipang* were cited to emphasize the stringent requirements for compliance and the need for justifiable reasons and proof of earnest efforts if complete compliance is impossible.
*   **Failure of Compliance:** The prosecution failed to prove that earnest efforts were made to secure the presence of a DOJ representative and elected public official, offering no sufficient justification for their absence. The Supreme Court emphasized that a Chief Tanod is not a substitute for an elected public official.
*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The failure to comply with the Chain of Custody Rule created reasonable doubt regarding the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized *shabu*, warranting acquittal.
* **Case law:** Absence of DOJ and elected public official representatives renders chain of custody broken unless justification is presented based on People v. Lim and People v. Umipang.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Chain of Custody:** This case reinforces the Supreme Court's strict interpretation of the Chain of Custody Rule in drug cases. Failure to meticulously comply with the procedural requirements, particularly regarding the presence of the required witnesses, can lead to acquittal, even if there is evidence of a buy-bust operation.
*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving both the reasons for the absence of the required witnesses and the earnest efforts made to secure their presence. A mere statement of unavailability is insufficient.
*   **"Earnest Efforts" Definition:** The definition of "earnest efforts" remains a contentious issue and subject to interpretation by the courts. The specific steps required to demonstrate "earnest efforts" must be clearly established.
*   **Implications for Future Cases:** This decision serves as a warning to law enforcement agencies to strictly adhere to the Chain of Custody Rule in drug cases to ensure successful prosecution. It also provides guidance to defense counsel in identifying potential weaknesses in the prosecution's case based on non-compliance with procedural requirements.
