**Case Summary: *De Borja v. Atty. Mendez, Jr.* (A.C. No. 11185, July 4, 2018)**

**Core Issue:** This is a disciplinary action against Atty. Ramon R. Mendez, Jr. for (1) negligence in failing to file an Appellant's Brief, leading to dismissal of the client's appeal; and (2) failure to account for and return funds received for a specific purpose (titling property).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Negligence (Canon 18, Rule 18.03, CPR):** Atty. Mendez found guilty of neglecting a legal matter entrusted to him by failing to file the Appellant's Brief within the prescribed period. The Court rejected his defense of non-receipt of notice, citing the registry return card and post office certification showing receipt by his secretary, Jennifer Lastimosa. The court referenced *Ford v. Atty. Daitol* (320 Phil. 53, 58 (1995)) & *People v. Villar* (150-B Phil. 97 (1972))
*   **Failure to Account and Return Funds (Canon 16, Rules 16.01 & 16.03, CPR):** Atty. Mendez received P300,000.00 for titling a property. He failed to use the money for its intended purpose or provide a satisfactory accounting and only partially returned P140,000.00 after demands. Court rejected argument he spent funds on other needs and titling of the property. References *Del Mundo v. Atty. Capistrano* (685 Phil. 687, 693 (2012)) & *Gutierrez v. Atty. Maravilla-Ona* (789 Phil. 619, 623 (2016)).
*   **Fiduciary Duty:**  The Court emphasized the high fiduciary duty lawyers owe to their clients, citing Canon 16, particularly regarding holding client funds in trust and providing an accounting.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Atty. Mendez is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for one (1) year, effective upon receipt of the decision.  A repetition of similar acts will result in a more severe penalty.
*   **Financial Restitution:** Atty. Mendez is ORDERED to RETURN the remaining balance of P160,000.00 to Jaime S. De Borja, plus legal interest, within ninety (90) days of the decision's finality.  Failure to comply will result in a more severe penalty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Compliance:**  The biggest risk is Atty. Mendez's failure to comply with the order to return the P160,000.00 plus legal interest.  Non-compliance will trigger a motion for a more severe penalty, potentially disbarment.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** If Atty. Mendez refuses to pay, the complainant will need to initiate execution proceedings to recover the funds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):**  The entire case hinges on violations of Canons 16 & 18, and their associated rules.
*   **Ford v. Atty. Daitol, 320 Phil. 53, 58 (1995); People v. Villar, 150-B Phil. 97 (1972)**: Referenced in discussion of lawyer's competence and diligence.
*   **Del Mundo v. Atty. Capistrano, 685 Phil. 687, 693 (2012)**: Referenced regarding obligation to return client's money held in trust.
