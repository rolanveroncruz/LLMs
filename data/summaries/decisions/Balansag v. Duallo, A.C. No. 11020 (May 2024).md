**Case:** *Inocentes Domie Balansag, Joel Molejon, and Bonifacio Catarata vs. Atty. Dave Duallo and Atty. Rodolfo Dacalos, Jr.*, A.C. No. 11020, May 15, 2024

**Summary:**

This is a disciplinary case against Attys. Duallo and Dacalos stemming from their representation of Timothy Bakeshop in a labor dispute. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the IBP's finding that the respondents violated the Lawyer's Oath and Canons II and III of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) (formerly the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)). The Court suspended the attorneys from the practice of law for six months.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Disregarding the duty to "delay no man for money or malice."
*   **CPRA (Formerly CPR) Canon II:**
    *   Section 2: Failure to respect the law, courts, and their processes.
    *   Section 5: Failure to insist on the observance of fairness and obedience to the law.
*   **CPRA (Formerly CPR) Canon III:**
    *   Section 2: Failure to uphold the rule of law and assist in the speedy administration of justice.
    *   Section 7: Filing frivolous suits and abusing court processes by unduly impeding the execution of a warranted judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Suspension from the practice of law for six months.
*   **Duty to Manifest Suspension:** Respondents must file manifestations with the Court and all tribunals where they appear, indicating the start of their suspension.
*   **Post-Suspension Obligations:** File a sworn statement with the Office of the Bar Confidant after completing the suspension, as per Section 45 of the CPRA.

**Grounds for Liability:**

The SC agreed with the IBP's finding that the respondents, after the labor case attained finality, filed motions and petitions with the primary intent to delay the execution of the judgment against their client. Specifically, the filing of a Petition for Certiorari after the complainants affirmed their signatures on the original complaint (thus resolving the forgery allegation) was deemed an abuse of process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The decision references and distinguishes penalties from prior cases such as *Saa v. IBP*, 614 Phil. 203 (2009), *David v. Rongal, et al.*, 875 Phil. 31 (2020), *Heirs of Reyes v. Brillantes*, A.C. No. 9594, April 5, 2022, and *Williams v. Atty. Enriquez*, A.C. No. 6321, July 26, 2023, in determining the appropriate sanction.
*   The Court relied on jurisprudence such as *Avida Land Corp. v. Argosino*, 793 Phil. 210 (2016) and *Ret. Judge Alpajora v. Atty. Calayan*, 823 Phil. 93 (2018) to emphasize the limitations on a lawyer's right to file pleadings and cases.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion Defense:** The respondents attempted to argue that they acted in good faith based on their client's representation of forgery. However, the Court rejected this defense as the forgery claim was negated after the complainants verified their signatures.
*   **Subjective Intent:** While the decision focuses on the objective actions of filing dilatory motions, the underlying subjective intent to delay execution is a key factor.
*   **Future Similar Conduct:** The SC sternly warned against future repetition of similar acts, indicating that any recurrence will result in more severe penalties.

**Recommendations:**

1.  Respondents should immediately comply with the suspension order, including filing the required manifestations.
2.  The decision highlights the ethical constraints on zealous advocacy and the need to avoid using legal processes for delay.
3.  Respondents should thoroughly review the CPRA and ensure that their future conduct aligns with its provisions, specifically regarding fairness, obedience to the law, and respect for court processes.
