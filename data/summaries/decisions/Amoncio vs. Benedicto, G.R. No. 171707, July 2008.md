**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Amoncio v. Benedicto*, G.R. No. 171707 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal by certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming an RTC decision regarding a dispute arising from a lease contract and subsequent construction agreements.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** A 5-year lease (renewable annually for 5 years) between Petitioners (Lessor) and Respondent (Lessee) for 240 sq. m. of land at P19,200/month.
*   **Rent Payment:** Advance payment of 6 months' rent (3 months deposit + 3 months advance). Clause making the lessee liable for the rentals of the remaining period of lease if he fails to complete the term of the lease
*   **Improvements:** Lessee responsible for taxes on structural improvements; all improvements become the property of the Lessor upon termination. Design specifications subject to Lessor approval.
*   **Parol Agreement:** Respondent claims an oral agreement with Petitioner to construct five commercial buildings on the property, with Respondent financing the construction and Petitioners obligated to pay for two buildings assigned to them.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Initially):** Claimed Respondent failed to pay rent, occupied portions of the property not covered by the lease, and sought recovery of possession and rentals. Petitioners rescinded lease contract.
*   **Respondent (Initially):** Denied default, claimed a separate construction agreement, and sought payment for buildings constructed for Petitioners.
*   **Ultimately, the Court held:** The Petitioners are liable to pay the respondent for unjust enrichment. The contract is the law between the parties, but equity may prevail when strict enforcement leads to injustice.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** The crucial issue is the admissibility of evidence regarding the alleged oral agreement for construction, potentially violating the parol evidence rule (Rule 130, Section 9, Rules of Court). While generally inadmissible to contradict a written agreement, exceptions exist for ambiguity, mistake, failure to express intent, validity challenges, or subsequent agreements. The Court found the presence of other agreements and allowed the evidence, noting Petitioners' failure to object to the testimony. *Willex Plastic Industries, Corp. v. CA* (1996) addresses waiver of the parol evidence rule.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The Court invoked equity principles to prevent Petitioners' unjust enrichment from the improvements made by Respondent, relying on *Advanced Foundation Construction Systems Corporation v. New World Properties and Ventures Inc.* and *Hulst v. PR Builders*.
*   **"Failure to Complete the Term" Clause:** The court did not enforce the clause making the lessee liable for the remaining rentals upon early termination, as the Lessor, not the Lessee, terminated the contract.
*   **Ambiguity of "Renewal" Clause:** The clause allowing annual renewal for a maximum of five years is ambiguous, as it could be construed to limit the entire lease to five years total.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45, Rules of Court (Appeal by Certiorari)
*   Rule 130, Section 9, Rules of Court (Parol Evidence Rule)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Bulay-og v. Bacalso* (G.R. No. 148795): Discusses the limited review of facts in Rule 45 petitions.
*   *Willex Plastic Industries, Corp. v. CA* (1996): Addresses waiver of the parol evidence rule by failing to object to inadmissible testimony.
*   *Advanced Foundation Construction Systems Corporation v. New World Properties and Ventures Inc.* and *Hulst v. PR Builders*: Cited for the principle of unjust enrichment and equitable jurisdiction.

**Summary:**

This case concerns a dispute over a lease contract and a subsequent alleged oral agreement for building construction. The court ultimately sided with the lessee, holding that the lessors were unjustly enriched by the lessee's improvements and that the lessors waived their right to object to the testimony regarding the alleged oral construction agreement. The Petitioners were ordered to pay the respondent the construction cost of the two buildings that went to them, and costs against Petitioners.
