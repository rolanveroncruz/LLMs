**Case Summary: _Barbieto v. Court of Appeals_ (G.R. No. 184645, October 30, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Court of Appeals' (CA) denial of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and/or Preliminary Injunction to stop: (1) a preventive suspension order issued by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices (ODO-MOLEO), and (2) an arrest and confinement order issued by the Commanding General (CG) of the Philippine Army (PA).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Maj. Gen. Barbieto faced administrative and criminal charges before the ODO-MOLEO (OMB-P-A-08-0201-B & OMB-P-C-08-0204-B) based on allegations of extortion related to army enlistments and irregularities with the Balik Baril program.
*   The ODO-MOLEO preventively suspended Barbieto for six months per Section 24 of RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act) and Section 9, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 7. The ODO-MOLEO considered this a preliminary step and not a penalty, citing Bernas on due process.
*   Independently, the Army Investigator General (AIG) investigated similar charges, recommending Barbieto's indictment under Articles of War (Articles 55, 96, & 97).
*   CG-PA Lt. Gen. Yano ordered Barbieto's arrest and confinement pending General Court Martial proceedings under Article 70 of the Articles of War.
*   Barbieto sought a TRO and Preliminary Injunction from the CA, which was denied.

**Key Issues:**

1.  Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion by denying the TRO and Injunction without a hearing.
2.  Whether the CA erred in finding Barbieto failed to demonstrate urgency or irreparable injury.
3.  Whether the CA erred in ruling the injunctive relief inextricably intertwined with the Petition's main issues.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the Petition.

*   **Mootness (ODO-MOLEO Suspension):**  Barbieto's six-month preventive suspension had expired, rendering the issue of enjoining it moot. Cites _Africa v. Sandiganbayan_ regarding mootness.
*   **Lack of Grave Abuse of Discretion (Arrest Order):** The CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in denying injunctive relief against the CG-PA's arrest order.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** The CA complied with procedural requirements. Cites Section 4, Rule VI of the 2002 Internal Rules of the CA.  Administrative Circular 20-95 is only applicable to Trial Courts, cites _Ko v. Philippine National Bank_ for general due process.
*   **Requisites for Injunction Not Met:**  Barbieto failed to demonstrate a "clear and unmistakable right" (_Philippine Ports Authority v. Cipres Stevedoring_) being violated without due process (Section I, Article III of the 1987 Constitution). Lt. Gen. Yano's actions are presumed to be in good faith.
*   The Court noted the right to liberty isn't absolute, citing the _Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo_.
*   **Preemption of Main Case:**  Granting the injunction would effectively pre-judge the main case pending before the CA (_Philippine Ports Authority v. Pier 8 Arrastre_).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 6770, Section 24:** Ombudsman's authority to preventively suspend.
*   **Articles of War, Articles 55, 96, 97, 70:** Offenses and arrest authority within the military.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article III, Section I:**  Due process clause.

**Potential Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **General Court Martial:** Barbieto faces trial before a General Court Martial for violations of the Articles of War if the CA rules against him.
*   **Continued Confinement:**  Barbieto remains subject to the CG-PA's arrest order and confinement pending the resolution of the certiorari petition by the CA and any subsequent court-martial proceedings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability and interpretation of due process requirements in administrative vs. criminal proceedings, particularly regarding the need for a hearing before issuing injunctive relief. The Supreme Court is not entirely clear whether any hearing is required, given discretion granted to Courts.
*   The balancing of the right to liberty against the military's need to maintain discipline and order.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act)
*   Articles of War (specifically Articles 55, 96, 97, 70)
*   1987 Constitution, Article III, Section I
*   _Africa v. Sandiganbayan_
*   _Philippine Ports Authority v. Cipres Stevedoring & Arrastre, Inc._
*   _Philippine Ports Authority v. Pier 8 Arrastre & Stevedoring Services, Inc._
*   _Ko v. Philippine National Bank_
*   _Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo_

**For the Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court focused heavily on procedural aspects, avoiding any pre-judgment of the underlying facts or the merits of the charges against Barbieto. The key takeaway is that the CA did not gravely abuse its discretion by denying the TRO and preliminary injunction based on the lack of demonstrable urgency or irreparable harm. Further, the Supreme Court also stated that preliminary injunctions cannot be issued if it would practically solve the whole case. Focus should be placed on presenting a compelling case before the Court of Appeals in the main petition for certiorari to argue that Lt. Gen. Yano's arrest order was issued without due process or legal basis.
