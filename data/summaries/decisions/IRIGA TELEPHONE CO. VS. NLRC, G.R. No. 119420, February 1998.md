### Summary of Iriga Telephone Co., Inc. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 119420

This case involves a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 challenging the NLRC's decision ordering Iriga Telephone Co., Inc. (ITELCO) to pay separation pay to Inocencio Praxides, a former employee, equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Factual Background:** Praxides, an ITELCO employee, complained about discrepancies in his BIR form and salary increases. Following a meeting with ITELCO's president, Atty. Ortega, an altercation occurred, resulting in Praxides being allegedly kicked and verbally abused and subsequently terminated.
*   **AWOL and Complaint:** Praxides didn't report for work and filed a complaint with the NLRC for unfair labor practice, underpayment, and damages, later amending it to include illegal dismissal, separation pay, and reinstatement.
*   **Labor Arbiter's Decision:** The Labor Arbiter dismissed the illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice claims but ordered reinstatement without backwages. If reinstatement was not feasible, separation pay equivalent to ½ month pay for every year of service, and labor benefits, or a total of P15,782.00.
*   **NLRC Decision:** The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision but modified the separation pay to one month pay for every year of service.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision without hearing despite ITELCO's insistence and the absence of an order stating that the Labor Arbiter found no necessity for further hearing.
2.  Whether the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in increasing the separation pay from ½ month to one month salary for every year of service.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC.

*   **On the Hearing:** The Court held that the Labor Arbiter has discretionary power to determine if a formal hearing is necessary (Section 4, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure) after the submission of position papers. ITELCO's numerous postponements contributed to the Labor Arbiter deeming the case submitted for decision.
*   **On the Separation Pay:** The Court emphasized the lower evidentiary threshold in labor cases (substantial evidence) compared to criminal cases (proof beyond reasonable doubt). While Atty. Ortega was acquitted of criminal charges, substantial evidence, including the filing of criminal charges, the police report, and medical records, supported the finding of an assault, justifying the award of separation pay. Furthermore, separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service is the standard when reinstatement is no longer feasible.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   ITELCO is obligated to pay Praxides separation pay equivalent to one month's salary for every year of service.
*   ITELCO is liable for its president's actions, which contributed to the strained relationship with Praxides, making reinstatement unfeasible.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Strained Relations:** The decision underscores the strained relations between Praxides and ITELCO, specifically Atty. Ortega, as a primary reason for denying reinstatement.
*   **AWOL:** While the arbiter found that Praxides voluntarily desisted from reporting for work, it acknowledged the company's fault in the situation, leading to the separation pay award.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari petition.
*   **Section 4, Rule V of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC:** Discretion of the arbiter regarding the need for a formal trial or hearing.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *NFL vs. NLRC*, G.R. No. 113466, December 15, 1997, citing *Salonga v. NLRC*, 254 SCRA 111 (1996); *Reformist Union of R.B. Liner, Inc. vs. NLRC*, 266 SCRA 713 (1997), citing *Sealand Service, Inc. vs. NLRC*, 190 SCRA 347 (1990).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of "voluntary" AWOL versus the company's role in creating circumstances that led to it remains a point of contention. The acquittal in the criminal case versus the substantial evidence standard in labor cases presents another contentious area.
