## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Cotton Corporation v. Naraindas Gagoomal and Engracio Ang* (G.R. No. 130389)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC's order directing the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to delete annotations related to Philippine Cotton Corporation's (PCC) claims from the respondents' (Gagoomal and Ang) land titles.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Pacific Mills originally owned several parcels of land, subsequently sold to the respondents on installment basis.
*   PCC filed a collection case against Pacific Mills and obtained a writ of preliminary attachment, which was annotated on Pacific Mills' TCTs.
*   The Quezon City Hall fire destroyed the original TCTs. Pacific Mills reconstituted the titles under RA 6732.
*   The reconstituted TCTs did not include the annotation of PCC's preliminary attachment but included the sale to and full payment by the respondents. Subsequently, clean titles were issued to respondents.
*   PCC requested the Register of Deeds to re-annotate the notice of levy and the Supreme Court's (SC) favorable decision on the new TCTs. The Register of Deeds complied, prompting the respondents to file a petition to cancel the annotations.
*   China Banking Corporation intervened as a mortgagee of the properties.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the Register of Deeds of Quezon City has the authority to re-annotate encumbrances/liens and annotate the Supreme Court decision on administratively reconstituted TCTs.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court held that the Register of Deeds lacked the authority to re-annotate the encumbrance. Affirmed the CA and RTC decisions.

**Legal Basis & Case Law:**

*   **Act No. 26 (Reconstitution of Torrens Certificates of Title):** This act outlines the process for reconstituting titles and liens. Section 4 specifies the order of sources for reconstituting liens. Sections 8 and 11 require a court petition for the annotation of interests not appearing on the reconstituted title.
*   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Sections 10 (General functions of Registers of Deeds) and 71 (Surrender of certificate in involuntary dealings) were cited by PCC but deemed inapplicable as they pertain to attachments *after* issuance of title, not prior encumbrances omitted during reconstitution.
*   **Section 108, P.D. No. 1529:** Explicitly grants the court the authority to amend and alter certificates of title, preventing the Register of Deeds from unilaterally making such changes.
*   **Distinction between PD 1529 and RA 26:** The Court emphasized that PD 1529 governs registration of property, while RA 26 is a *special law* dealing specifically with reconstitution of titles.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Register of Deeds has a *ministerial duty* to register instruments, but only those that comply with registration requirements.
*   Under RA 26, the *burden lies on the interested party (PCC)* to file a petition with the court to annotate its interest on the reconstituted title.
*   **No liability** found on the part of the respondents, as they acquired titles without the prior encumbrance reflected on the new titles.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **PCC's loss of priority:** PCC's failure to follow proper procedure to re-establish its lien leaves it vulnerable, and its claim is potentially subordinated to other interests (e.g., China Banking Corporation's mortgage).
*   **Allegation of fraud:** PCC's accusation of fraudulent issuance of the TCTs to respondents implies a potential future action for damages or nullification of the titles, though this is unlikely to succeed without strong evidence.
*  **Lack of Annotation** The court clearly states that the register of deeds may not simply annotate something to the new titles. This is for the court to decide.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, confirming that the Register of Deeds lacked the authority to re-annotate a preliminary attachment lien on reconstituted land titles. The court reasoned that the procedure for reconstituting titles under RA 26 requires a court petition to annotate previously existing liens omitted from the reconstituted title.  PCC's reliance on the general provisions of PD 1529 was misplaced. PCC must pursue its claim through a court action to have the lien annotated. The primary risk is PCC's potential loss of priority due to the failure to properly re-establish its lien. A potential (though currently weak) claim of fraudulent issuance exists. The holding emphasizes the importance of adhering to the specific procedures outlined in RA 26 for reconstituting liens and encumbrances.
