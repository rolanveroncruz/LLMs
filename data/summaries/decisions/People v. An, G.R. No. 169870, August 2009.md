## Legal Document Summary: People v. Elegio An (G.R. No. 169870)

**Case:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for simple rape.

**Key Provisions:**
*   Accused found guilty of simple rape under the Revised Penal Code based on the testimony of the victim, Conchita Maranan.
*   The crime occurred on March 8, 1998, in Barangay Bukal, Tagkawayan, Quezon.
*   Victim testified that the accused forcibly undressed her and inserted his penis into her vagina causing pain, threatening her if she revealed the incident.

**Obligations:**
*   The accused has the obligation to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The accused has the obligation to pay the victim Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity and Php 50,000.00 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**
*   Criminal liability for rape, resulting in a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Civil liability to the victim for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Mental Capacity of Victim:** While the Information mentions the victim as a “mental retardate,” the prosecution failed to present conclusive clinical evidence to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. The CA and SC correctly disregarded the claim of qualified rape. Relying on *People v. Dalandas* (G.R. No. 140209, December 27, 2002), the SC highlights the necessity of clinical evidence in borderline cases to accurately assess mental condition.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense argued inconsistencies in the victim's testimony undermined her credibility. The court dismissed these as minor and insignificant details that did not detract from the central fact of rape, citing *People v. Espino, Jr.* (G.R. No. 176742, June 17, 2008).
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The accused presented an alibi, claiming to be at a baptismal celebration during the incident, corroborated by witnesses. The court rejected this defense, holding that the distance between the alibi location and the crime scene (approx. 9km), coupled with the time difference, did not create "physical impossibility" for the accused to be present at the crime scene, in line with *People of the Philippines v. Catalino Mingming* (G.R. No. 174195, December 10, 2008).
*   **Credibility of Witness:**  This case hinges heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony.  The SC emphasizes deference to the trial court's assessment of credibility, absent any compelling reason to overturn their findings, citing *People v. Abulon* (G.R. No. 174473, August 17, 2007) and *People v. Nasario Castel* (G.R. No. 171164, November 28, 2008).

**Statutory References:**
*   Revised Penal Code (Rape)

**Case Law:**
*   People v. Dalandas, G.R. No. 140209, December 27, 2002, 394 SCRA 433.
*   People v. Espino, Jr., G.R. No. 176742, June 17, 2008, 554 SCRA 682.
*   People of the Philippines v. Catalino Mingming, G.R. No. 174195, December 10, 2008.
*   People v. Abulon, G.R. No. 174473, August 17, 2007, 530 SCRA 675.
*   People v. Nasario Castel, G.R. No. 171164, November 28, 2008.

**Overall:** The case reaffirms the importance of the victim's credible testimony in rape cases and the stringent requirements for establishing an alibi. The absence of conclusive evidence for mental retardation of the victim prevented a conviction for qualified rape.
