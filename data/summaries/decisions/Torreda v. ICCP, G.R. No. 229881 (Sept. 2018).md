## Legal Document Summary: *Torreda v. Investment and Capital Corporation of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 229881, Sept. 5, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decision which affirmed the Labor Arbiter (LA) ruling finding constructive dismissal.

**Key Provision:**  The central issue is whether Petitioner Jonald O. Torreda (IT Senior Manager) was constructively dismissed or voluntarily resigned from Respondent Investment and Capital Corporation of the Philippines (ICCP).

**Facts:** Torreda alleges he was forced to resign.  ICCP claims Torreda voluntarily resigned due to poor performance.  The CA found for ICCP, while the LA and NLRC found constructive dismissal.  Key evidence revolves around a resignation letter presented to Torreda by William Valtos (ICCP Officer-in-Charge), which Torreda initialed after initially refusing to sign it, and after Valtos allegedly pressured him and stated that he will be terminated if he did not resign. The CA emphasized the fact that the petitioner edited the letter and was therefore voluntary.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) **GRANTS** the petition, reverses the CA, and reinstates the NLRC decision, **WITH MODIFICATION** (deletes award of moral and exemplary damages). SC finds Torreda was constructively dismissed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   ICCP is obligated to pay Torreda backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement (due to strained relations).

**Reasoning:**
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The SC found that the acts of ICCP, through Valtos, created an impossible, unreasonable, and unlikely condition of continued employment for Torreda. The SC applied the correct test, "whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his position under the circumstances."
*   **Involuntary Resignation:** The SC applied the *Fortuny Garments/Johnny Co v. Castro* (514 Phil. 317 (2005) standard for determining voluntariness of resignation, focusing on the employee's actions **before and after** the alleged resignation. SC notes several circumstances showing lack of intent to resign, including the immediate filing of an illegal dismissal complaint.  The SC ruled that "Verily, it was respondent, not petitioner, which had a prior contemplation of removing the latter as its employee."
*   **Employer's Burden:** The SC emphasized that when an employee denies the authenticity and due execution of a resignation document, the employer bears the burden to prove its due execution and genuineness. ICCP failed to meet this burden.
*   **Lack of Just Cause:** The SC found that ICCP failed to present substantial evidence to support any just cause for dismissal under Article 282 (now 285) of the Labor Code, as no actual dismissal was initiated by respondent.
*   **Rejection of CA's Rationale:** The SC rejected the CA's emphasis on Torreda's editing of the letter and managerial position, finding these factors insufficient to prove voluntariness in light of the coercive circumstances.
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** The SC deleted the awards for moral and exemplary damages because no evidence was presented to show bad faith, oppression, or malice on the part of the employer.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Precedent:**  The facts are very specific here, and could raise challenges when applying the legal interpretation in other cases.

**Statutory References:**
*   Labor Code, Article 282 (now 285) - Just Causes for Termination
