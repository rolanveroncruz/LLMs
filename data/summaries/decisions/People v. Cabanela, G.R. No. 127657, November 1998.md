## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cabanela (G.R. No. 127657)

**Case Overview:** This is an automatic review of a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Felipe Cabanela of rape and sentencing him to death. The prosecution accused Cabanela of raping his 14-year-old daughter, Genelyn.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659 par. (1) (incestuous rape of a minor). This carries the death penalty.
*   **Judgment:** The RTC found Cabanela guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced him to death. Also ordered to pay the victim P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.
*   **Evidentiary Basis:** Conviction based on:
    *   Testimony of the victim, Genelyn Cabanela, detailing the rape.
    *   Corroborating testimony of the victim's brother, Gerry Cabanela, who claimed to witness the event.
    *   Medical examination findings of healed hymenal lacerations.
    *   Admission of guilt and request for forgiveness by the accused to the victim's mother, Juanita O. Cabanela.

**Defense:**

*   Alibi: Cabanela claimed he was at sea fishing at the time of the alleged incident, corroborated by his father, Victor Cabanela.

**Court's Reasoning (Affirming Conviction):**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The court found the victim's testimony credible, noting her positive, categorical, straightforward, and spontaneous manner. Also noting tears during her testimony.
*   **Rejection of Alibi:** The Court rejected the alibi as weak, unreliable, and easily fabricated. The alibi was also deemed insufficient to demonstrate physical impossibility. Corroboration by relatives was viewed with suspicion.
*   **Lack of Respecter of Time/Place for Lust:** The court dismissed the argument that the crime was unlikely during Holy Week (Good Friday).
*   **Parental Negligence:** The court pointed out the father's irresponsibility because his children were out-of-school youths, and he could not provide for his family.
*   **Damages:** Increased civil indemnity to P75,000.00. Moral damages of P50,000. Exemplary damages of P20,000 upheld.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Obligation to face the death penalty and pay damages to the victim.
*   **State:** Obligation to provide due process and prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constitutionality of Death Penalty:** Four justices adhered to the separate opinions expressed in *People v. Echegaray*, questioning the constitutionality of R.A. 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty.
*   **Reliance on Testimony:** The conviction heavily relied on the victim's testimony.
*   **Alibi Corroboration:** The court strongly discounted the corroboration of the alibi by the accused's father, citing familial bias and lack of personal knowledge.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape and prescribes penalties.
*   **R.A. No. 7659 par. (1):** Amends Article 335 to include death penalty for incestuous rape of a minor.
*   **Section 25 of R.A. No. 7659 amending Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code**: Mandates that the records of the case be forwarded to the Office of the President upon finality of the decision, for possible exercise of the pardoning power.
*   **Section 36, Rule 130, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure**: Deals with a witness's testimonial evidence based on his/her personal knowledge.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Sangil:** (Moral depravity of incestuous rape).
*   **People v. Melivo:** (Moral depravity of incestuous rape).
*   **People v. Godoy & People v. Cartuano:** (Crimes against chastity require careful scrutiny).
*   **People v. Esquila & People v. Ganguso:** (Moral certainty needed).
*   **People v. Atuel & People v. Excija:** (Trial judge best position to assess witness credibility).
*   **People of the Philippines v. Marcelino vs. Erardo**: (Accused's act of begging for forgiveness is an admission of guilt)
*   **People of the Philippines v. Marcelino Bugarin, People v. Alimon, People v. Quinevista:** (lust is not a respecter of time and place)
*   **People v. Canada:** (alibi must show that the accused was not at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission)
*   **People v. AÃ±onuevo & People v. Danao:** (alibi less plausible when corroborated by relatives)
*   **People v. Ligotan:** (alibi must receive credible corroboration from disinterested witnesses).
*   **People of the Philippines v. Renato Bautista:** (Hearsay evidence is inadmissible)
*   **People v. Prades:** (On the amount of indemnity)
*   **People v. Echegaray:** (Constitutionality of death penalty).

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence for Felipe Cabanela based on the victim's credible testimony, circumstantial evidence, and the rejection of the accused's weak alibi. While some justices questioned the constitutionality of the death penalty, the majority ruled in favor of its imposition. The case highlights the gravity of incestuous rape and the court's emphasis on protecting the victim's rights.
