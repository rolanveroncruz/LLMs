## Legal Document Summary: Velasco v. Casaclang, G.R. No. 111130 (1998)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Certiorari and Prohibition)

**Issue:** Whether the Deputy Ombudsman for the AFP acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying Petitioner Laura Velasco's Motion to Quash in OMB Case No. 0-90-0296, charging her with violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), and asserting jurisdiction over the preliminary investigation.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Deputy Ombudsman's orders.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **COA Audit Report:** A special audit of AFP Logistics Command transactions revealed alleged irregularities in the procurement of stainless steel meat cans, including a suspiciously rapid transaction cycle, common incorporators among winning bidders, and higher costs for CAFGU supplies compared to regular military units.
*   **Ombudsman Jurisdiction:** The decision affirms the Ombudsman's primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and the authority of the Deputy Ombudsman to conduct preliminary investigations.
*   **R.A. 6770 (Ombudsman Act):** Confirms Ombudsman's powers to investigate and prosecute public officials, including the power to delegate functions to Deputies (Sec. 15).
*   **Administrative Order No. 07:** Section 4(d) disallows motions to dismiss during preliminary investigation except for lack of jurisdiction.
*   **R.A. 3019:** Petitioner accused of violations of Sec. 3(e) and (g) of this Act.
*   **Obligation to File Counter-Affidavit:** The petitioner was obligated to file a counter-affidavit after being served a subpoena. Failure to do so resulted in a waiver of the right to be heard.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of R.A. 3019:** Petitioner potentially liable for violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act based on the alleged irregularities in the procurement process.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** If the preliminary investigation finds sufficient cause, petitioner faces potential criminal prosecution before the Sandiganbayan.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 3019, Sec. 3(e) and (g):** Alleged violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The specific sections refer to causing undue injury to any party or the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same, whether or not the public officer profited or will profit thereby
*   **R.A. 6770 (Ombudsman Act), Sec. 11(4)(a):** Discussed in relation to the authority of the Special Prosecutor vs. the Ombudsman.  Ultimately supports Ombudsman's authority.
*   **P.D. 1630, Sec. 17:** Argued by petitioner regarding the exclusive authority of the Tanodbayan (Special Prosecutor) to conduct preliminary investigations, but deemed abrogated by the 1987 Constitution (Art. XI, Sec. 7).
*   **1987 Constitution, Art. XI, Sec. 7:**  Distinguishes between the Ombudsman and the Special Prosecutor, limiting the Special Prosecutor's powers to those not conferred on the Ombudsman.
*   **1987 Constitution, Art. XI, Sec. 13:** Outlines the powers, functions, and duties of the Office of the Ombudsman.
*   **E.O. 244:** Limits the Special Prosecutor's authority.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 112, Sec. 3 & 4:** Procedure for preliminary investigations and limitations on motions to dismiss.
*   **Zaldivar v. Sandiganbayan, 160 SCRA 843 (1988):** Relevant case affirming the Ombudsman's authority to conduct preliminary investigations and direct the filing of criminal cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "promptness of action" rationale used to justify the denial of the motion to quash could be seen as potentially overlooking valid legal challenges.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The speed of the transaction cycle raised significant concerns about potential corruption and abuse of power.
*   The common incorporators among the winning bidders suggest possible collusion and manipulation of the bidding process.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Deputy Ombudsman's jurisdiction and denial of the Motion to Quash. The decision highlights the broad powers of the Ombudsman to investigate and prosecute corruption cases, even in cases that may also involve the Special Prosecutor.  The Court emphasized the petitioner's failure to file a counter-affidavit and the policy against motions to dismiss during preliminary investigations. The petitioner remains at risk of prosecution under R.A. 3019.
