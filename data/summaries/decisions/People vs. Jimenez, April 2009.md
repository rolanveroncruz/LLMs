**Legal Document Summary - *People v. Jimenez*, G.R. No. 170235**

**Case Overview:** This is a review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Jaime Cadag Jimenez for two counts of simple rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, committed against his biological daughter, AAA, who was 11 years old at the time of the incidents.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment) was imposed for each count.
*   **Damages:** RTC ordered the payment of P50,000.00 civil indemnity and P50,000.00 moral damages for each count of rape. The Supreme Court *modified* the decision to include P25,000.00 exemplary damages for each count.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant: Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count.
*   Accused-Appellant: Pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages as stipulated above.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is criminally liable for two counts of simple rape.  Although the evidence presented during trial proved parental relationship (aggravating circumstance), he was only held criminally liable for simple rape because the information filed by the prosecutor failed to include the qualifying circumstance of the parent-child relationship which increased his liability to "qualified rape".

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Dates:** Accused argued the prosecution failed to establish the *exact* dates of the rape incidents. The Court correctly rejected this argument; exact dates are not material to the crime of rape if the allegations are as near to the actual date as the information or complaint will permit.
*   **Credibility of Victim:** Accused challenged AAA's credibility due to alleged inconsistencies and implausibility (e.g., other family members not waking up during the rapes). The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, which was affirmed by the CA.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The accused's alibi was deemed unconvincing due to lack of corroborating evidence and positive identification by the victim.
*   **Lack of Complaint to Mother:** The argument that the victim did not immediately disclose the abuse to her mother or the police was rejected.  The court recognized that AAA's young age, fear of her father, and shame could account for the delay. This is consistent with jurisprudence regarding the expected behavior of rape victims.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, finding no reason to overturn the lower courts' assessments of witness credibility and the sufficiency of evidence. The addition of exemplary damages emphasizes the gravity of the offense and serves as a deterrent against similar acts. The key issue revolves around the evidence which was primarily dependent on the testimony of the victim.
