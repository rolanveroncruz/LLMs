## Legal Document Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Asok*, G.R. No. 172248 (2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision reversing RTC decision dismissing respondents' complaint for repurchase of land under Sec. 119 of CA 141 (Public Land Act).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 119, CA 141 (Public Land Act):** Grants homesteader/patentee (or their widow/legal heirs) the right to repurchase land acquired under free patent/homestead provisions within five years from the date of conveyance.
*   **Act 3135:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **DBP's Obligation:** DBP, as the purchaser at the foreclosure sale, is obligated to reconvey the property to the respondents upon payment of the redemption price.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Asok owned land under a free patent (OCT No. P-4272). Upon their death, their son, Denison Asok, inherited the land and obtained TCT No. T-9626 in his name.
*   Denison Asok and his wife (respondent Ella Gagarani Asok) mortgaged the land to DBP.
*   Failure to pay led to extrajudicial foreclosure; DBP was the highest bidder.
*   DBP consolidated ownership; TCT No. T-27172 was issued in DBP's name.
*   Respondents (Denison Asok's heirs) filed suit to repurchase under Sec. 119, CA 141.

**Legal Issues and Holdings:**

1.  **Applicability of Sec. 119, CA 141:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that Sec. 119 applies even though a new title was issued in the name of the patentee's son because the policy of keeping the land within the family is fulfilled.
2.  **Definition of "Legal Heirs":** SC defined "legal heirs" broadly to include anyone called to succession by will or law, encompassing intestate heirs like the respondents (including the daughter-in-law, Ella Gagarani Asok). *Salenillas v. CA* supports this liberal interpretation, prioritizing the law's purpose.
3.  **Prescription of the Right to Repurchase:**  SC confirmed the period begins from the **expiration of the one-year redemption period** after the registration of the certificate of sale (December 24, 1992 registration + 1 year = Dec 24, 1993). The 5-year repurchase period under Section 119 begins AFTER that. Respondents filed their complaint within the prescribed period (May 15, 1998, before Dec 24, 1998 deadline). *Rural Bank of Davao City, Inc. v. CA* provides the established timeline.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **DBP's Liability:** DBP is liable to reconvey the property to the respondents if they pay the redemption price.
*   **Respondents' Liability:** Respondents are liable to pay the redemption price to DBP. Failure to do so will likely result in the loss of their repurchase right.
*   **Potential Risk for DBP:** The SC's decision upholds the right to repurchase under Sec. 119, prioritizing the land's preservation within the family of the original patentee. DBP's ownership is contingent on the respondents' failure to exercise their repurchase right by not providing the redemption price.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Salenillas v. CA*, 169 SCRA 829 (1989):  Liberal interpretation of "legal heirs."
*   *Madarcos v. de la Merced*, 174 SCRA 599 (1989): Broader Definition of "legal heirs."
*   *Rural Bank of Davao City, Inc. v. CA*, 217 SCRA 554 (1993): Establishes the timeline for redemption and repurchase.
*   *Ferrer v. Mangente*, 151-A Phil. 427 (1973): Emphasizes protection for the homesteader and their family.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "legal heirs" in Sec. 119:** While SC interpreted it broadly, future cases might attempt to restrict the definition.
*   **Determination of "Redemption Price":** The exact redemption price is not defined in this document, could lead to future disputes.

**Conclusion:**

The SC ruled in favor of the respondents, upholding their right to repurchase the property under Sec. 119, CA 141. The decision confirms a broad interpretation of "legal heirs" and clarifies the timeline for exercising the repurchase right. DBP must reconvey the property upon payment of the redemption price by the respondents. The primary risk lies in defining and determining the appropriate "redemption price".
