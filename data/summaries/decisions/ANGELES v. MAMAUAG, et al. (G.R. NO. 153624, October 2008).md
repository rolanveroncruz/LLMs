## Legal Document Summary: *Judge Adoracion G. Angeles v. P/Insp. John A. Mamauag, et al.* (G.R. No. 153624, October 24, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision setting aside the PNP Chief and NAB decisions which ordered the dismissal of respondents.

**Key Issue:** Whether the PNP Chief had jurisdiction to modify his initial decision based on a motion for reconsideration filed by the private complainant, Judge Angeles, and whether a private complainant has standing to appeal/move for reconsideration of decisions in PNP administrative cases.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, AFFIRMING the CA decision *with modification*. The PNP Chief's modified decision was void due to lack of jurisdiction because the private complainant lacked standing to appeal/move for reconsideration.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Lack of Standing for Private Complainant:** Citing *The National Appellate Board (NAB) of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) v. P/ INSP John A. Mamauag, et al.* (G.R. No. 149999), the Court reiterated that RA 6975 (PNP Law) does NOT grant private complainants the right to appeal a decision of a disciplining authority. Private complainants are considered mere witnesses for the government. This lack of standing extends to motions for reconsideration.
*   **Sections 43 and 45 of RA 6975:** The court interprets "either party" in these sections as (1) the PNP member-respondent or (2) the government when prosecuting the case. The government party, however, is NOT the disciplining authority. This interpretation seeks to maintain the impartiality of the disciplinary process and prevent the disciplining authority from becoming an advocate.
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:** Because the private complainant lacked standing, the PNP Chief's entertainment of the Motion for Reconsideration was an exercise of jurisdiction he did not possess, rendering all subsequent actions (including the modified decision) void.
*   **Reinstatement of Initial Decision:** The original decision of the CPDC District Director dismissing the charges against the respondent police officers was reinstated as it had become final and executory.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6975 (PNP Law):** Specifically, Sections 43 and 45 regarding the right to appeal decisions of the PLEB and disciplining authority, and Section 48 regarding back salaries and benefits.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *The National Appellate Board (NAB) of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) v. P/ INSP John A. Mamauag, et al.* (G.R. No. 149999, August 12, 2005): This prior case established the precedent that RA 6975 does not grant private complainants the right to appeal/move for reconsideration.
*   *Mathay, Jr. v. Court of Appeals:* Affirmed that CSC should not act as advocate in an appeal of its own decision.
*   *Dacoycoy v. Internal Affairs Office of the Ombudsman:* Reiterates quasi-judicial body should not act as an advocate.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Obligation to Reinstate:** The CPDC District Director's decision dismissing the charges is reinstated.
*   **Entitlement to Back Salaries/Benefits:** The respondents are entitled to back salaries and other benefits under Section 48 of RA 6975.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The definition of "government party" that can appeal remains somewhat nuanced, but the court clearly excludes the disciplining authority itself.
*   The reliance on the earlier case involving some of the same parties suggests a potential for res judicata or collateral estoppel arguments in future related litigation.
*   The case highlights a potential due process concern if a private complainant's lack of standing significantly limits their ability to seek redress for perceived misconduct by police officers.

**Conclusion:**

This case clarifies that, under RA 6975, private complainants lack the legal standing to appeal or move for reconsideration of decisions in administrative cases against PNP members. The Supreme Court's ruling reinforces the principle that the disciplining authority must remain impartial and cannot act as an advocate for the complainant. The respondents are therefore entitled to reinstatement and compensation for the period of their dismissal/suspension.
