**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Hu Chuan Hai vs. Spouses Unico***

**Case:** G.R. No. 146534, September 18, 2009 (616 Phil. 364)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Hu Chuan Hai and Leoncia Lim Hu
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Renato and Maria Aurora J. Unico

**Subject Matter:** Validity of a tax sale; Res Judicata; Notice requirements for tax sales.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Tax Sale Validity:** The Supreme Court (SC) declared the tax sale valid.
*   **Res Judicata:** The SC found that the RTC's prior decision (LRC Case No. Q-3458[86]) in a petition for consolidation of ownership barred the subsequent action (Civil Case No. Q-50553) to annul the tax sale. This was based on the doctrine of *res judicata*.
*   **Notice of Tax Sale:** The SC held that the City Treasurer correctly sent notice of the tax sale to the registered owners (Spouses de los Santos), despite the respondents being the actual occupants. The Unicos failed to register the transfer of the property or declare it in their names for tax purposes.
*   **Registered Owner as Taxpayer:** The SC reiterated the principle that for real property taxation purposes, the registered owner is deemed the taxpayer, citing *Talusan v. Tayag* (408 Phil. 373 (2001)) and *Estate of the Late Mercedes Jacob v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 120435, 22 December 1997, 283 SCRA 474).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Register Property:** The respondents (Unicos) failed in their statutory duty to register the property transfer and declare it for taxation under Section 6 of PD 464 (Real Property Tax Code). This omission ultimately prejudiced their claim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Fairness Argument:** While the decision is legally sound based on registration principles, a potential argument could be raised regarding fairness and due process. While the *legal* owners received notice, the actual possessors (Unicos) were unaware, leading to a loss of their property. However, this is mitigated by their own failure to fulfill their legal obligations.
*  **PD 464 Obsolescence:** While the court cites PD 464, it notes that it has been superseded by the 1991 Local Government Code. Any future challenges might focus on whether the same registration responsibilities and notice rules apply under the current code.

**Statutory References:**

*   **PD 464, Section 6:** (Real Property Tax Code) - Duty to declare real property.  This is a key provision highlighting the Unico's failure to comply with their obligations.
*   **Local Government Code of 1991:** Superseded PD 464 regarding real property taxation.

**Case Law References:**

*   ***Talusan v. Tayag*** **(408 Phil. 373 (2001)):** Decision of land registration court in petition for consolidation of ownership and registration precludes another action for annulment of auction sale.
*   ***Estate of the Late Mercedes Jacob v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. No. 120435, 22 December 1997, 283 SCRA 474):** A local treasurer must verify with the Register of Deeds who the registered owner of the particular property is.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the importance of registering property and complying with tax declaration obligations. The ruling clarifies that notice to the registered owner is sufficient for a tax sale, even if the property is occupied by an unregistered transferee. The *res judicata* finding further strengthens the finality of land registration court decisions. While the case is straightforward based on existing law, potential challenges could arise based on fairness considerations or interpretations of the current Local Government Code.
