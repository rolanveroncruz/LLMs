**Legal Document Summary: Royal Plains View, Inc. v. Mejia**

This Supreme Court decision partially grants the petition of Royal Plains View, Inc. (Petitioner) against Nestor Mejia (Respondent), modifying the Court of Appeals (CA) decision. The core issue revolves around the validity of a "Rescission of Deed of Conditional Sale" executed by Mejia concerning a commercial parcel of land previously conditionally sold to Petitioner.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Contract Classification:** The court affirms the CA's determination that the agreement between the parties is a **Contract to Sell**, not a Contract of Sale. Ownership remains with Mejia until full payment of the purchase price.
*   **Maceda Law Inapplicability:** The court finds that R.A. 6552 (Maceda Law) does not apply because this is a commercial property and not a residential property. The protections afforded to residential buyers under the Maceda Law are not applicable.
*   **Cancellation vs. Rescission:** The Court clarifies that while labelled a "rescission," Mejia's action was effectively a cancellation of the Contract to Sell, permissible due to Petitioner's default, but the court finds it invalid due to the failure of Nestor to make a demand for payment to Royal and to properly notify the petitioner about his intent to cancel the contract.
*   **No Demand, No Default**: Since there was no evidence of a formal demand (judicial or extrajudicial) for payment of the remaining balance from Mejia to Royal, the Petitioner had not incurred in delay, and thus, were not yet in default.
*   **Equitable Relief:** Despite the valid cancellation, the Court grants Petitioner 60 days from finality of the decision to pay the outstanding balance of P4,432,500.00. Upon full payment, Mejia is ordered to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale. Failure to pay within this period will result in cancellation of the Deed of Conditional Sale and payments made to be considered rentals.
*   **Damages Denied:** The Court denies both parties' claims for damages, emphasizing that non-payment in a Contract to Sell is not a breach, but a condition that prevents the contract from becoming binding.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Obligated to pay P4,432,500.00 within 60 days. Failure to pay results in forfeiture of previous payments and loss of rights to the property.
*   **Respondent:** Obligated to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale upon receipt of full payment.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Title Issues:** Although not explicitly addressed, underlying title issues with OCT No. (P-1324) P-232 and the subsequent TCTs could resurface and complicate the transfer of title.
*   **Third-Party Claims:** The decision notes that disgruntled lot buyers have filed cases against the Petitioner. The outcome of those cases and their impact on the subject property are not directly addressed.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing payment from the Petitioner, or the execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale by the Respondent, may require further legal action depending on the parties' compliance.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6552 (Maceda Law):**  Cited but deemed inapplicable to the case due to the commercial nature of the land.
*   **Articles 1191 and 1592 of the Civil Code:**  Distinguished; rescission under these articles is not applicable to Contracts to Sell.
*   **Luzon Brokerage Co., Inc. v. Maritime Building Co., Inc.:**  Establishes the right of a seller to cancel installment sales of commercial/industrial properties upon default.
*   **Lim v. Court of Appeals (182 SCRA 564 [1990]):**  Distinguishes a contract to sell and a contract of sale.

**Contentious Clauses and Legal Precision:**

*   The term "rescission" in the original document is legally inaccurate, clarified by the court as a "cancellation" of a Contract to Sell.
*   The validity of unilateral cancellation in Contracts to Sell of commercial properties is confirmed, emphasizing the need for proper notice to the defaulting party.
