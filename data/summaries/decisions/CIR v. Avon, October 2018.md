## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc.

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 201398-99 & 201418-19 (October 3, 2018)

**Parties:** Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) and Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc. (Avon)

**Subject Matter:** Deficiency tax assessments for 1999 (Income Tax, Excise Tax, VAT, Withholding Tax on Compensation, Expanded Withholding Tax) and the validity of waivers of the statute of limitations.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Avon, declaring the deficiency tax assessments null and void due to a violation of administrative due process by the CIR.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Due Process Violation (Key Issue):** The Court found that the CIR failed to properly consider Avon's defenses and evidence submitted during the assessment process. Identical Preliminary Assessment Notices (PAN), Final Assessment Notices (FAN), and Collection Letters were issued, ignoring Avon's submissions and partial payments. The CIR did not provide reasons for rejecting Avon's explanations, particularly regarding the sales discrepancy, despite Avon's submission of relevant documents, including the general ledger. This inaction violated Section 228 of the Tax Code and Revenue Regulations No. 12-99, rendering the assessments void. (Citing *Ang Tibay v. CIR*, *Baguio Country Club Corp. v. NLRC*)

2.  **Invalidity of Waivers:** The Court affirmed the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) ruling that the Waivers of the Defense of Prescription were defective because the CIR failed to furnish Avon with signed copies, violating Revenue Memorandum Order No. 20-90. This rendered the VAT, expanded withholding tax, and withholding tax assessments prescribed. (Citing *CIR v. Kudos Metal Corporation*)

3.  **Estoppel:** The CIR argued that Avon was estopped from challenging the waivers because it paid portions of the assessments. The Court rejected this argument, distinguishing it from *Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. CIR*. In *RCBC*, estoppel was applied because the taxpayer benefited from a drastic reduction of the deficiency taxes. Here, Avon received no benefit; on the contrary, there was an increase to their taxes and they were compelled to pay a portion of the assessments in an attempt to have the assessments cancelled.

4.  **Prescription:** The general rule is that, according to Section 203 of the Tax Code, the CIR has 3 years from the filing of a return to assess taxpayers.

5.  **Timeliness of Appeal:** The CIR argued that Avon's appeal to the CTA was prescribed because Avon failed to appeal within 30 days from the lapse of the 180-day period for the CIR to act on the protest as per Section 228 of the Tax Code. The Court held that the Collection Letter constituted a final decision of the CIR, and Avon's appeal, filed within 30 days of receiving the Collection Letter, was timely. *Lascona Land Co., Inc. v. CIR* reiterated the rule that taxpayers can opt to wait for the final decision. The Court invoked Section 228 of the Tax Code and Rule 4, Section 3(a)(2) of the 2005 Rules of the Court of Tax Appeals.

*   **Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue:** Collection letter may be an appealable decision to the CTA.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Finality:** The determination of whether a communication constitutes a "final decision" by the CIR can be contentious. This case clarifies that a Collection Letter can be a final decision if it demonstrates the Commissioner's clear intention to deny the protest and collect taxes.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Avon, nullifying deficiency tax assessments for 1999 due to a lack of administrative due process by the CIR. The Court held that the CIR failed to adequately consider Avon's defenses and evidence, issuing identical notices without addressing Avon's submissions. The CIR was found to have violated Section 228 of the Tax Code and related regulations. The waivers of prescription were also deemed invalid due to the CIR's failure to provide signed copies to Avon, therefore they are prescribed. The court held that *RCBC* did not apply because there were no benefits received and Avon was compelled to pay a portion of the taxes. The Supreme Court upheld the taxpayers' right to have their evidence considered and their defences responded to.

As such, this case emphasizes the importance of upholding the standards of fairness and equity in taxation. Taxpayers have a right to have their evidence considered during the assessment process and for decisions to be made in accordance with the law and the Bureaus own internal rules.
