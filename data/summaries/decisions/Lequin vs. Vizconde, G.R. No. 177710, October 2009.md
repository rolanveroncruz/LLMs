## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Ramon Lequin and Virginia Lequin vs. Sps. Raymundo Vizconde and Salome Lequin Vizconde*, G.R. No. 177710, October 12, 2009

**Case Overview:** Petitioners (Lequins) seek reversal of the CA decision that upheld the validity of a *Kasulatan ng Bilihang Tuluyan ng Lupa* (Contract of Absolute Sale) involving 512 sq.m. of a larger lot owned by them, and ordered the respondents (Vizcondes) to return PHP 50,000 without interest. The Supreme Court granted the petition, reversing the CA decision, and reinstating the RTC decision with modification.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Kasulatan ng Bilihang Tuluyan ng Lupa (Kasulatan):** A contract of sale dated February 12, 2000, purportedly conveying 512 sq.m. of the Lequin's land to the Vizcondes for PHP 15,000.

**Facts:**

*   Lequins owned a 10,115 sq.m. lot. Vizcondes claimed to have bought a 1,012 sq.m. portion from the same seller (de Leon) within the land.
*   Vizconde negotiated the sale of the larger lot for the Lequins from de Leon.
*   Lequins built their house on 500 sq.m. of the disputed 1,012 sq.m., while the Vizcondes live on the remaining 512 sq.m. portion.
*   The *Kasulatan* was executed on the advice of a notary public to formalize the apparent sale of 512 sq.m. to the Vizcondes. In reality, the Lequins paid the Vizcondes PHP 50,000 for the 500 sq.m. upon which the Lequinâ€™s house was built.
*   The Lequins later discovered that Vizcondes only bought a dried-up canal (sapang patay) from the original seller, Carlito de Leon.
*   Lequins filed suit for nullity of contract, sum of money, and damages.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Declared the *Kasulatan* null and void due to vitiated consent and lack of consideration.
*   Ordered Vizcondes to return PHP 50,000 with 12% interest, plus moral, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Reversed the RTC decision and declared the *Kasulatan* valid.
*   Ordered Vizcondes to return PHP 50,000 without interest.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Reversed the CA decision, finding *actual fraud* on the part of Vizconde.
*   The *Kasulatan* is voidable due to vitiated consent, as per Art. 1330 and 1338 of the Civil Code. Vizconde misrepresented the ownership of the 1,012 square-meter lot.
*   Lack of consideration renders the contract null and void ab initio, per Art. 1471 of the Civil Code. The PHP 15,000 stated in the Kasulatan was never actually paid. Section 9 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence states when it is permissible to present evidence to modify, explain, or add terms to the written agreement if issues are put in pleading, such as in this case.
*   Reinstated the RTC decision with modification of the interest rate on the PHP 50,000 (6% from filing of complaint to finality of judgment, then 12% thereafter).
*   Reinstated the award of moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   Acknowledged Lequin's ownership of the 512 sq.m. on which the Vizconde's house is built, but left any action regarding said house to the Lequins' discretion.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Art. 1305 (definition of contract), Art. 1318 (essential elements of contract), Art. 1330 (voidability due to fraud), Art. 1338 (fraudulent inducement), Art. 1339 (duty to disclose facts), Art. 1471 (simulated price), Art. 22 (unjust enrichment), Art. 2208(2) (attorney's fees).
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence:** Section 9, Rule 130.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Manila Banking Corporation v. Silverio*, G.R. No. 132887, August 11, 2005 (definition of absolutely simulated contract)
*   *De Jesus v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, G.R. No. 72282, July 24, 1989
*   *Montecillo v. Reynes*, G.R. No. 138018, July 26, 2002

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *Kasulatan* itself, specifically the discrepancy between the stated consideration (PHP 15,000) and the actual transaction (Lequins paying Vizcondes PHP 50,000).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ownership Disputes:** The ruling clarifies ownership, but potential disputes regarding the Vizconde's house on Lequin's land remain. The resolution of how the property is handled would be determined by the latter.
*   **Enforcement:** Ensuring the Vizcondes comply with the monetary judgment.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   The successful assertion of fraud and lack of consideration are critical for setting aside the contract.
*   The reliance on *parol evidence* to contradict the written terms of the *Kasulatan* was successfully argued due to the exception under Section 9 of Rule 130.
*   Unjust enrichment was successfully invoked to justify the return of the PHP 50,000 payment.
