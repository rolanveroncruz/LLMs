## Legal Document Summary: Ng Ching Ting v. Philippine Business Bank, Inc.

**Case:** G.R. No. 224972, July 9, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC order granting a motion for reconsideration and setting aside the dismissal of a collection suit.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Promissory Notes & Suretyship:** Jonathan Lim obtained loans from Philippine Business Bank (PBB) covered by promissory notes. Ng Ching Ting (Petitioner) executed a continuing suretyship agreement with Carolina Lim guaranteeing Lim's loans.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage & Foreclosure:** Lim and Carolina secured the loans with a real estate mortgage. Upon default, PBB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage, but the proceeds were insufficient to cover the debt.
*   **Collection Suit:** PBB filed a collection suit against Jonathan, Carolina, and Ng Ching Ting for the deficiency.
*   **Dismissal for Failure to Prosecute (Rule 17, Sec. 3):** The RTC *motu proprio* dismissed the case due to inaction of both parties for nearly a year after denial of the motion to dismiss by the petitioner.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** PBB filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was initially out of time.
*   **RTC Order Granting Motion for Reconsideration:** RTC granted PBB's motion, reasoning that previous in-house counsels resigned without informing new counsels of the case status, leading to inaction.
*   **CA Affirmed RTC:** CA affirmed the RTC, citing substantial justice should prevail over technical rules.

**Obligations:**

*   Jonathan Lim: Primary obligation to repay the loans per the promissory notes.
*   Ng Ching Ting & Carolina Lim: Secondary obligation as sureties, jointly and severally liable with Jonathan for the loan repayment up to the extent guaranteed by the suretyship agreement.
*   Philippine Business Bank: Obligation to prosecute the case diligently.

**Liabilities:**

*   Jonathan Lim, Ng Ching Ting, and Carolina Lim: Potential liability for the outstanding loan amount including interest, penalties, and legal fees.
*   Philippine Business Bank: Exposure to potential claims for damages if the dismissal of the case had attained finality and the lower court ruling was incorrect.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Dismissal:** The core issue is whether the RTC's initial order of dismissal had become final and executory due to PBB's failure to file its Motion for Reconsideration within the reglementary period.
*   **Validity of Motion for Reconsideration:** Whether a motion of reconsideration, filed out of time, can validly reinstate a dismissed case.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Whether the RTC abused its discretion by granting the Motion for Reconsideration filed out of time.
*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:** The court emphasizes that the respondent reneged on it’s duty to prosecute the case diligently and failure to file the motion for reconsideration on time.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:** Governs dismissal due to the plaintiff's fault, including failure to prosecute. Dismissal typically operates as an adjudication on the merits unless otherwise specified.
*   **Rule 52, Section 1, Rules of Court:** 15-day period to file a motion for reconsideration.
*   **Fortich vs. Corona, 359 Phil. 210 (1998):**  Emphasis on the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules for the orderly administration of justice.
*   **BPI vs. Court of Appeals, 362 Phil. 362 (1999):**  Dismissal for failure to prosecute rests on the sound discretion of the trial court, which must not be abused.
*   **V.C. Ponce Company, Inc. vs. Municipality of Parañaque, 698 Phil. 338, 351 (2012):** Rejected the petitioner's plea for relaxation of the rules due to lack of counsel.
*   **Social Security System vs. Isip, 549 Phil. 112, 116 (2007):** Discusses the finality of judgments and loss of jurisdiction by the court.
*   **Mayon Estate Corporation vs. Altura, 483 Phil. 404 (2004):** When a final judgment is executory, it becomes immutable and unalterable.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Receipt of Order:** The date of receipt of the RTC's dismissal order is disputed. PBB claimed a later date, while the post office certifications indicated earlier receipt. The Affidavit of the letter carrier confirms the official date of receipt.
*   **"Excusable Neglect":** Whether the resignation of in-house counsel constitutes excusable neglect justifying the delay in filing the Motion for Reconsideration. The Court here found it insufficient justification.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA and reinstated the RTC's original order of dismissal. The Court held that PBB failed to file its motion for reconsideration within the reglementary period, making the initial dismissal final and executory. The Supreme Court found that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in granting the Motion for Reconsideration filed out of time.
