Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 166516) in markdown format:

**Case:** Emma Ver Reyes and Ramon Reyes v. Irene Montemayor and the Register of Deeds of Cavite

**Citation:** 614 Phil. 256 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for Reconveyance and declaring Irene Montemayor the owner of the subject property.

**Key Issue:** Who has a better right to the subject property? Specifically, was there a valid double sale?

**Facts:**

*   **Petitioners (Reyeses):** Claim ownership based on a Deed of Absolute Sale from Marciano Cuevas dated 1976 (TCT No. T-58459). They paid taxes but failed to register the sale.
*   **Respondent (Montemayor):** Claims ownership based on a Deed of Absolute Sale from Marciano Cuevas dated 1992. (TCT No. T-369793), registered in her name.
*   **Alleged Forgery:** Reyeses allege Montemayor's deed is based on forged signatures of the Cuevas spouses.
*   **NBI Report:** Senior Document examiner Carolyn Moldez-Pitoy of the NBI issued Questioned Documents Report No. 548-795 stating that Virginia Cuevasâ€™s signature was forged on the Deed of Absolute Sale dated 10 November 1992.
*   **Montemayor's Waiver:** Montemayor later executed a "Waiver and Quitclaim," admitting the "dubiousness" of her title and recognizing the title of Engracia Isip (and her heirs) to the subject property, leading to the cancellation of Montemayor's TCT and the issuance of a new one (TCT No. T-784707) in the name of Engracia's heirs.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and ruled in favor of the Petitioners (Reyeses).

**Key Legal Provisions & Rationale:**

1.  **No Double Sale:** The Court found the evidence preponderated against a valid second sale to Montemayor, highlighting Marciano's testimony denying the sale and the NBI report confirming the forgery of Virginia's signature.

2.  **Forged Deed is Void:** The Court cited *Fudot v. Cattleya Land, Inc., G.R. No. 171008, 13 September 2007, 533 SCRA 350, 361*, holding that a forged deed conveys no title and is a nullity.  Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 53, paragraph 2, was invoked regarding registration procured by fraud.

3.  **Reconveyance Proper:** Even with a Torrens title, fraud vitiates the registration. *Heirs of Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, 360 Phil. 753, 765 (1998)*, the registration of the property in said person's name would not be sufficient to vest in him or her the title to the property. Since Montemayor's title was fraudulently obtained, the remedy of reconveyance to the rightful owner (Reyeses) is available, citing *Amerol v. Bagumbaran, G.R. No. L-33261, 30 September 1987, 154 SCRA 396, 404*.

4.  **Engracia's Heirs are not Innocent Purchasers:** They acquired the property through Montemayor's dubious Waiver and Quitclaim.

5.  **Nominal Damages and Attorney's Fees:** Awarded to the Reyeses based on Article 2221 and Article 2208(5) of the Civil Code, respectively, due to the violation of their rights and Montemayor's bad faith. However, Exemplary Damages are not proper.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)
*   Civil Code Articles 2221, 2208 and 2229

**Case Law:**

*   Fudot v. Cattleya Land, Inc., G.R. No. 171008, 13 September 2007, 533 SCRA 350, 361
*   Heirs of Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, 360 Phil. 753, 765 (1998)
*   Amerol v. Bagumbaran, G.R. No. L-33261, 30 September 1987, 154 SCRA 396, 404

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Register of Deeds Liability:**  The Court strongly criticized the Register of Deeds for Cavite.  While not explicitly held liable, their actions could be grounds for administrative investigation or future claims if negligence or malfeasance can be proven.
*   **Engracia's Heirs Rights:**  The decision binds Engracia's heirs as successors-in-interest to Montemayor.  They may attempt further legal challenges, although their claim appears weak given the circumstances.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinged significantly on factual determinations (forgery, intent, etc.), creating potential for continued disputes regarding implementation of the reconveyance.

**Obligations:**

*   **Register of Deeds:** To cancel TCT No. T-784707 and issue a new certificate of title to the Reyeses.
*   **Irene Montemayor:** To pay the Reyeses nominal damages and attorney's fees.
