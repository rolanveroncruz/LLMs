**Legal Document Summary: University Physicians Services Inc.-Management, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 205955)**

**Case Overview:**

This case involves a petition by University Physicians Services Inc.-Management, Inc. (UPSI-MI) challenging the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc decision denying its claim for a tax refund or Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) of its excess unutilized creditable income tax for the taxable year 2006. The central issue is the application of the irrevocability rule under Section 76 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 76, NIRC:** This section outlines the options available to a corporation that overpays its income tax: (1) carry over the excess credit, or (2) be credited or refunded. The crucial provision is the irrevocability clause: "Once the option to carry-over... has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable..."
*   **Section 228, NIRC:** Paragraph (c) is referenced, discussing situations where a taxpayer claiming a refund or TCC has also carried over the same amount as tax credit, allowing the BIR to issue a final assessment notice (FAN) to recoup the double benefit.

**Key Facts:**

*   UPSI-MI overpaid its income tax in 2006 and initially indicated on its Annual ITR an intention to be issued a TCC for the excess amount.
*   However, in its original 2007 Annual ITR, UPSI-MI included the 2006 excess credit as "Prior Year's Excess Credits."  An amended return was filed removing the excess, but the BIR and CTA found this insufficient to overcome the carry-over.

**CTA Rulings:**

*   The CTA ruled that UPSI-MI effectively exercised the carry-over option by including the excess credit in its 2007 return, making the initial request for a TCC irrevocable.
*   The CTA En Banc upheld this decision, stating that the irrevocability rule applies once the carry-over option is chosen, even if done inadvertently.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision, holding that the irrevocability rule under Section 76 applies only to the *carry-over* option, not to the option for refund or TCC. However, the Court found that UPSI-MI had *constructively* chosen the carry-over option by including the excess in its 2007 return, barring it from later claiming a refund.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Irrevocability:** While technically only applicable to the carry-over option, any act construed as exercising the carry-over option, even inadvertently, can preclude a refund or TCC claim.
*   **Potential for Assessment:** If UPSI-MI had *already* received a refund or TCC for the 2006 overpayment and then carried it over as a credit, Section 228(c) would allow the BIR to assess them for the double benefit.
*   **Loss of Refund:** UPSI-MI lost its claim for a tax refund or TCC due to the constructive exercise of the carry-over option.
*   **Continued Carry-Over Benefit:** The Court acknowledges that the taxpayer retains the right to utilize the excess tax credits from the initial option to carry-over such credits.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, Sections 76 and 228:** The core statutory provisions governing the taxpayer's options and the irrevocability rule.
*   ***Philam Asset Management, Inc. v. Commissioner***:  Cited to argue that both options are mutually exclusive and irrevocable, but the Supreme Court clarified that *Philam* involved situations where the taxpayer failed to explicitly choose an option or constructively chose carry-over. The Supreme Court stated the case did not establish a *doctrinal rule* that refund or TCC is irrevocable.
*   ***Commissioner v. PL Management International Philippines, Inc.***:  Reinforced the alternative nature of the options, but the Supreme Court clarified that *PL Management* was decided under the NIRC where the irrevocability rule was applicable.
*   **Philippine Bank of Communications v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (PBCom)**:  Referred in the decision of the Court. However, *PBCom* did not lay out a doctrinal rule that the option to claim refund or TCC is irrevocable.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Constructive" Exercise of Carry-Over:** The Court's finding that UPSI-MI constructively exercised the carry-over option by including the excess in its 2007 return opens the door for future disputes regarding what constitutes sufficient action to invoke the irrevocability rule, especially in cases where the taxpayer claims inadvertence or mistake.
*   **Interpretation of Section 228(c):** The court's interpretation of Section 228(c) as applying only when a refund has already been granted limits the BIR's ability to pursue assessments in situations where a refund application is still pending.

**Conclusion:**

This case clarifies that, under Section 76 of the NIRC, the *carry-over* option is the only irrevocable option. However, it also establishes a precedent where actions can be construed as a *constructive* exercise of the carry-over option, even if a refund was initially requested. It emphasizes the importance of carefully completing tax returns and avoiding any action that could be interpreted as a change of election.
