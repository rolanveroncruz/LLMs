**Case:** *L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. v. McDonald's Corporation* (G.R. No. 233073, February 14, 2018)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision finding L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. (Big Mak) guilty of indirect contempt for allegedly violating a permanent injunction against trademark infringement and unfair competition related to McDonald's "Big Mac" mark. The Supreme Court (SC) reverses the CA, finding Big Mak *not* guilty of contempt.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Permanent Injunction (August 16, 1990):** Big Mak was enjoined from:
    *   Using "Big Mak" or any similar mark likely to cause confusion.
    *   Selling/distributing products purporting to be manufactured by McDonald's.
    *   Using any mark that suggests a connection with McDonald's.
    *   Restraint was for the National Capital Region only.

*   **Monetary Award:** Big Mak was ordered to pay McDonald's actual damages (P400,000), exemplary damages (P100,000), and attorney's fees (P100,000).

*   **Compliance with Supreme Court Decision (G.R. No. 143993):** Big Mak was obligated to adhere to the reinstated RTC decision implementing the permanent injunction.

**Alleged Violation and Contempt Charge:**

McDonald's alleged Big Mak continued to use "Big Mak" in its stalls and products, defying the injunction.  Furthermore, they allege a refusal to fully pay the damages awarded.

**SC Ruling and Rationale:**

The SC found no basis for the contempt charge, emphasizing:

1.  **No Willful Disobedience:** Big Mak demonstrably shifted to using "Super Mak" and/or its corporate name "L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc." The SC rejected the CA's interpretation of Francis Dy's judicial affidavit as an admission of belated compliance.
2.  **Use of Corporate Name Not Contemptuous Per Se:** The injunction targeted the mark "Big Mak," not the legitimate use of Big Mak's *corporate* name.
3.  **Good Faith:** Big Mak acted in good faith based on a pre-existing Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Decision (SEC-AC No. 426) that was favorable to Big Mak regarding its corporate name. The SC noted the CA's error in suggesting the Supreme Court overturned the final SEC decision.
4.  **Intent is Critical:** Contempt requires a *willful* disregard of a court order. The SC found no such intent on the part of Big Mak.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **No Contempt Liability:** Big Mak avoids the contempt penalty (fine of P30,000 imposed by CA).
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court reinstated the Regional Trial Court judgement that McDonald's had to pay Big Mak damages for suffering injury to its reputation.
*   **Continued Risk of Infringement Claims:** While the contempt charge failed, McDonald's could still pursue future infringement claims if Big Mak's current practices (e.g., use of "Super Mak", corporate name) are deemed confusingly similar *and* not warranted by the injunctionâ€™s wording.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 71, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:** Defines indirect contempt.
*   **Castillejos Consumers Association, Inc. v. Dominguez, et al., 757 Phil. 149, 158 (2015):** Defines contempt of court.
*   **Saint Louis University, Inc., et al. v. Olairez, et al., 730 Phil. 444, 461 (2014):** Good faith as a defense in contempt.
*   **The Executive Secretary and Lomibao v. Gordon, et al., 359 Phil. 266, 275 (1998):** The power to punish contempt should be preservative, not vindictive.
*   **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Decision (SEC-AC No. 426):** Crucial in establishing Big Mak's good faith in using its corporate name.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of the Injunction:** The ambiguity lies in whether the prohibition extended to *any* use of "Big Mak," even as part of the corporate name. The SC interprets it narrowly, focusing on the use of the mark itself.
*   **Definition of "Colorable Imitation":** Whether "Super Mak" is a colorable imitation of "Big Mac" was *not* the central issue in this contempt case, though it could be relevant in future infringement actions.
*   **Geographical Scope:** The original injunction was limited to the National Capital Judicial Region, so activities outside that area would not constitute a violation.
