    *   Lack of clarity regarding where marking of the evidence took place and who performed the marking, including absence of the accused.

This case highlights the importance of strict compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, and emphasizes that inconsistencies in the testimonies can create reasonable doubt regarding the guilt of the accused.
