## Legal Document Summary: *Divinagracia v. Ozon*, A.M. No. P-23-077, January 30, 2024

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Michael Vincent L. Ozon, Clerk III, RTC, Butuan City, for Gross Misconduct and violation of R.A. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Solicitation of Money:** Ozon allegedly solicited PHP 25,000.00 for the release of a certificate of finality in a nullity of marriage case. Complainant "Divinagracia" and other individuals shared similar experiences.
*   **Expedited Service for a Fee:** Affidavits allege Ozon offered to expedite service of decisions in nullity cases to the OSG via private courier for PHP 5,000.00, circumventing standard procedures and shortening the period for the OSG to file an appeal.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC Violation:** By using private couriers to send decisions to the OSG instead of registered mail, Ozon violated Section 19(2) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC ("Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages").
*   **Violation of Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Soliciting money and using his position for personal gain violated Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Canon I of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel.
*   **JIB Report:** The Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) recommended Ozon's dismissal for gross misconduct.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Denied demanding money. Claimed he only prepared certificates of finality; the Branch Clerk of Court was responsible for their release.
*   Submitted affidavits from petitioners in the 10 nullity cases mentioned by Affiant 1, attesting that he never contacted them for money.
*   Discredited Affiant 1 and Affiant 2.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Guilty of Gross Misconduct:** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of Executive Judge Calo and the JIB, finding Ozon guilty of gross misconduct for demanding money from litigants and expediting service for a fee.
*   **Dismissal from Service:** Ozon was dismissed from service with forfeiture of all benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office.

**Key Statutory References and Case Law:**

*   **R.A. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees)**
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC** ("Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages"), Section 19(2) re: service via registered mail.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel**, Canon I, Sections 1-4 re: Fidelity to Duty
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (as amended)**, Section 14(a) and 17(1) re: gross misconduct as a serious charge and applicable sanctions.
*   *Rodriguez v. Eugenio*, 550 Phil. 78 (2007): Case law cited supporting dismissal for demanding money from litigants.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Affidavits:** The decision hinges heavily on the affidavits of Affiant 1 and Affiant 2.  Respondent's attempts to discredit them were unsuccessful, but their credibility could be further challenged.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While there's strong evidence of expedited service, the link to a specific *quid pro quo* arrangement might be considered circumstantial to some extent.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The delay in forwarding Ozon's Comment dated December 16, 2020 to the Office of the Clerk of Court En Banc created some challenges in fairness and was handled by noting the document.

**Ambiguous Areas:**

*   **Scope of "Expediting":**  While the court found Ozon expedited service, the precise mechanisms and contacts within the OSG facilitating this were not fully detailed. This could raise questions about the extent of his involvement.
*   **Degree of "Corruption":**  While the court mentions corruption as an element of gross misconduct, a clearer articulation of the corrupted process could strengthen the case.

This summary provides a legally precise overview of the document, highlighting key aspects for a lawyer's review. Further analysis could involve scrutinizing the affidavits, researching the OSG's procedures for handling nullity cases, and examining similar administrative cases involving court personnel misconduct.
