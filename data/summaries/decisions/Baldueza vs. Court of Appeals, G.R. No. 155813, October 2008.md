**Case Summary: Baldueza v. CA & Prudential Bank, G.R. No. 155813 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision that upheld the RTC's issuance of a writ of possession in favor of Prudential Bank.

**Facts:** Cecilia Baldueza mortgaged property to Prudential Bank to secure a loan. Upon default, the bank extrajudicially foreclosed under Act No. 3135. The bank was the highest bidder. Baldueza filed a suit for declaration of nullity and damages (Civil Case No. 818-M-95). Baldueza failed to redeem within the one-year period. The bank consolidated ownership and obtained a new title.  The bank then filed an *ex parte* petition for a writ of possession (LRC Case No. P-389-2001), which the RTC granted. The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions and Legal Issues:**

*   **Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, Sec. 7:** The core issue revolves around the interpretation and application of this provision regarding the purchaser's right to a writ of possession in extrajudicial foreclosure. The Court reiterates that after the redemption period, the issuance of the writ becomes a *ministerial duty* of the court upon proper application and proof of title (TCT No.T-297416 (M)).
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The Supreme Court emphasized the ministerial duty of the lower courts to issue the writ of possession to the foreclosing bank after consolidation of title, relying on established jurisprudence.
*   **Good Faith of Mortgagee/Purchaser:** Baldueza argued the bank was not a good-faith mortgagee/purchaser, alleging the bank (1) deliberately caused the notice of lis pendens to be removed, (2) did not allege the pendency of the annulment of mortgage in its petition, (3) had a defective verification and (4) did not conduct an ocular inspection of the subject property. The court rejected this argument because it was a factual issue that the lower courts had already ruled on, finding that the bank did not act in bad faith.
*   **Pending Suit for Annulment:** Despite the pending suit for annulment of the mortgage (Civil Case No. 818-M-95), the Court held that the bank was still entitled to a writ of possession, without prejudice to the outcome of the pending case.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Vda. de Zaballero v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 106958, 229 SCRA 810 (1994):** Cited for the proposition that after the redemption period, no bond is required for the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   **LZK Holdings and Development Corp. v. Planters Development Bank, G.R. No. 167998, 522 SCRA 731 (2007):** Reaffirms the settled principle of the buyer's absolute ownership after the redemption period and the ministerial duty of the court.
*   **Jetri Construction Corporation v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, G.R. No. 171687, 524 SCRA 522 (2007):** Holds that a writ of possession may be issued despite a pending suit for annulment of the mortgage.

**Obligations:**

*   The RTC has a *ministerial duty* to issue a writ of possession to the purchaser (Prudential Bank) after consolidation of ownership and presentation of title.
*   Baldueza (or her successors) are obligated to vacate the premises.

**Liabilities:**

*   Baldueza is liable for the costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Pending Annulment Suit (Civil Case No. 818-M-95):** The primary risk is the potential outcome of the annulment suit. While the writ of possession was upheld, a ruling in favor of Baldueza in the annulment case *could* retroactively affect the validity of the foreclosure and the bank's title, potentially leading to a reversal of the possession order. This point is crucial and should be monitored.
*   **"Good Faith" Argument:** Baldueza's allegations of bad faith, while ultimately unsuccessful in this case, highlight the potential for similar challenges in other foreclosure scenarios. The diligence of the mortgagee in the foreclosure process is always a potential point of attack.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision to uphold the issuance of a writ of possession to Prudential Bank. The Court held that after the redemption period expired, the bank became the absolute owner and the issuance of the writ was a ministerial duty of the court. The pending suit for annulment of the mortgage does not preclude the issuance of the writ, but its outcome could potentially affect the bank's title. The "good faith" of the bank was argued, but not proven. The primary legal risk hinges on the outcome of the pending suit for annulment.
