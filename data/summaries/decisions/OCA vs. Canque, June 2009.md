## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator v. Sylvia Canque*

**Document:** A.M. No. P-04-1830, June 04, 2009 (606 Phil. 209), Supreme Court *En Banc* decision.

**Subject Matter:** Administrative case against Sylvia Canque, Clerk of Court, 12th MCTC, Moalboal-Badian-Alcantara-Alegria, Cebu, for Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Gross Dishonesty.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Entrapment Operation:** Canque was caught in an NBI entrapment operation receiving P40,000.00 from Marissa Ypanto in exchange for the release of Ypanto's common-law husband (Jovencio Patoc) and dismissal of drug charges (RA 9165 violation). Forensic evidence confirmed fluorescent powder on Canque's hands.
*   **Audit Findings:** COA audit revealed a cash shortage of P304,985.00 in Canque's cash collection for court funds. She failed to provide a satisfactory explanation or produce the missing funds.
*   **Violation of Code of Conduct:** The court held that Canque violated Section 2, Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, specifically regarding soliciting/accepting gifts to influence official actions.
*   **Breach of Duties as Clerk of Court:** Canque failed in her administrative duties as Clerk of Court, including updating the cashbook and accounting for missing collection records.
*   **Due Process:** The court found that Canque was afforded due process as she was given the opportunity to comment on the allegations. The Court disagreed with the OCA's initial assessment that Canque was not provided with Due Process.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Dismissal:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of all benefits except accrued leave credits. Disqualification from re-employment in government service. This is aligned with Section 22 (a), (b) and (c) of Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292.
*   **Restitution:** Order to return P304,985.00 to cover the cash shortage.
*   **Financial Offset:** Accrued leave credits will be applied to the shortage if full restitution is not made.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Canque's Defense:** Canque's defense hinged on denying directly touching the money and suggesting the NBI planted the evidence. This was rejected by the court based on the NBI agents' credible testimony and forensic evidence.
*   **Reliance on Entrapment Evidence:** The court heavily relied on the entrapment operation. Defense counsel could have argued the validity of the entrapment based on issues of inducement.
*   **Procedural Due Process Arguments:** The OCA argued that Canque was not given the right to be heard during the investigation. The Court rejected that argument, stating that Canque was allowed to comment on the complaint.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **RA 9165:** Violation of Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, the underlying crime related to the bribery.
*   **RA 3019 Sec. 3(b):** The NBI filed an information for violation of Sec. 3 (b) of RA 3019 against Canque in the RTC. This is referenced in the decision.
*   **Fernandez v. Gatan, A.M. No. P-03-1720, May 28, 2004, 420 SCRA 19:** Cited for the definition of Grave Misconduct.
*   **Bureau of Internal Revenue v. Organo, G.R. No. 149549, February 26, 2004, 424 SCRA 9:** Cited for further clarifying Grave Misconduct.
*   **Section 23, Rule XIV, Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** The court used this Section of the Omnibus Rules to justify the penalty imposed.
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Bernardino, A.M. No. P-97-1258, January 31, 2005, 450 SCRA 88, 119-120.** Used to impose the penalties on Canque.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of comment from Canque on the COA findings might be seen as an admission, although a stronger argument would be presenting independent evidence of the shortage and her failure to properly manage court funds.
*   The decision does not explicitly address what happened with the cases the bribe was meant to influence.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case is a straightforward administrative matter where a Clerk of Court was found guilty of Grave Misconduct, Gross Neglect of Duty, and Gross Dishonesty based on an NBI entrapment operation and a COA audit. The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal and restitution order, finding no violation of due process. Potential challenges could have focused on the legality of the entrapment and the adequacy of the evidence regarding the shortage.
