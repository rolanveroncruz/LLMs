**Legal Document Summary: Republic vs. Javier, G.R. No. 179905 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the MTC's grant of Neptuna Javier's application for original registration of title under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot 30162-B, Csd-04-014340-D, Sta. Ana, Taytay, Rizal (12,903.50 sq. m.).
*   **Applicant's Claim:** Neptuna Javier claimed ownership through inheritance from her aunt, Catalina Javier, asserting open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession by her and her predecessor-in-interest since 1907 (Catalina) and since 1974 for Neptuna Javier. Possession is continuous under a claim of ownership since before June 12, 1945.
*   **Republic's Opposition:** Argued that Javier failed to prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, that the muniments of title were insufficient, and that the property was part of the public domain. Asserted casual cultivation.
*   **LLDA's Opposition (Initially):** Claimed the property was part of the bed of Laguna de Bay, thus public land under RA 4850. Later withdrew this claim, issuing a certification confirming property's location above reglementary lake elevation.
*   **MTC and CA Decisions:** Both ruled in favor of Javier, granting her application for original registration. The CA affirmed the MTC's finding that Javier had sufficiently established her title and met the requirements under Section 14(1) of PD 1529.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the CA, upholding the registration in favor of Javier. Held that the evidence sufficiently established Javier's and her predecessor's possession and occupation in the manner and for the period required under the law. Determined that the property was alienable and disposable based on the CENRO report and Javier's approved plan, as supported by the LLDA certification.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Applicant (Javier):** To demonstrate open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of alienable and disposable land of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier, per Section 14(1) of PD 1529.
*   **Republic:** To present evidence refuting the applicant's claim and establishing that the land remains part of the public domain or is not alienable and disposable.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Republic:** Failure to effectively oppose the application resulted in the confirmation of Javier's title.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 14(1) - Basis for the application for original registration.
*   **Republic Act No. 4850 (Laguna Lake Development Authority Act):** Initially invoked by the LLDA, but later abandoned.
*   **Regalian Doctrine:** Implied reference; the Republic argued that Javier failed to overcome the presumption that the property belonged to the State.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Petition must only raise question of laws.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The nature and extent of acts constituting "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession" was disputed by the Republic, arguing Javier's evidence was insufficient.
*   The alienable and disposable status of the property was initially contested by the LLDA, but later contradicted by its own certification.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Challenges:** The registration could potentially be challenged in the future if new evidence emerges demonstrating the property is not alienable and disposable or if there are irregularities in the registration process. However, the Supreme Court affirmed that the lower courts already ruled in favor of Javier and there was no support to overturn that ruling.
