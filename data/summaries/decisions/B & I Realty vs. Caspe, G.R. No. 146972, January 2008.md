**Legal Document Summary: B & I Realty Co., Inc. vs. Teodoro Caspe and Purificacion Aguilar Caspe, G.R. No. 146972 (2008)**

**Nature of the Document:** A Supreme Court decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari regarding a judicial foreclosure action. The core issue is whether the action for judicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage had prescribed.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Mortgage:** Arturo Datuin obtained a loan from B & I Realty, secured by a real estate mortgage over a property covered by TCT No. 377734.
*   **Assumption of Mortgage:** Spouses Caspe (Respondents) purchased the property from Datuin, assuming the mortgage obligation to B & I Realty.
*   **Payment History:** Respondents made payments on the mortgage from February 12, 1976, to January 14, 1980.
*   **Foreclosure Action:** B & I Realty filed an action for judicial foreclosure on August 27, 1993.
*   **Prescription:** Respondents raised the defense of prescription.

**Obligations:**

*   **Original Mortgagor (Datuin):** Obligated to repay the loan to B & I Realty as per the mortgage agreement.
*   **Respondents (Caspes):** Obligated to assume and settle Datuin's mortgage debt as part of the purchase agreement.
*   **B & I Realty:** Obligated to release the mortgage upon full payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Datuin:** Primarily liable for the original loan.
*   **Respondents:** Secondarily liable for the mortgage debt upon assumption.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** The court ultimately ruled that the action for judicial foreclosure had prescribed, meaning B & I Realty could not enforce the mortgage through judicial means.
*   **Invalidity of Mortgage:** While not explicitly ruled upon, the underlying fraud perpetrated by Datuin in obtaining the initial title could raise questions about the validity of the mortgage itself, although B&I was considered a mortgagee in good faith.
*   **Procedural Errors:** The initial failure to raise the prescription defense in a motion to dismiss (under older Rules of Court) could have been fatal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1142, Civil Code:** A mortgage action prescribes after ten years.
*   **Article 1151, Civil Code:** Defines when the time for prescription of actions to enforce obligations to pay principal with interest runs (from the last payment).
*   **Article 1155, Civil Code:** The prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the court, when there is a written extrajudicial demand by the creditors, and when there is any written acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor.
*   **Section 1, Rule 9, 1997 Rules of Court:** Defines defenses and objections not pleaded and potential exceptions. Retroactive application upheld here.
*   **Section 8, Rule 15, 1964 Rules of Court:** "Omnibus motion rule" regarding waiver of defenses not raised.
*   **PNB v. Perez, L-20412 (1966) & PNB v. Pacific Commission House, L-22675 (1969):** Exceptions to the omnibus motion rule under the old Rules of Court where the complaint or evidence clearly shows the action is prescribed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reckoning Date for Prescription:** The point from which the 10-year prescriptive period should be counted was contested. The court determined it began from the last payment made by the Caspes (Jan 14, 1980) and not the initial maturity date of the loan with Datuin.
*   **Effect of Civil Case No. 36852:** B & I Realty argued this case interrupted prescription, but the court disagreed, noting it was an action for annulment, not foreclosure. A cross-claim should have been filed by B&I in that case to protect its right to foreclose.
*   **Application of Rules of Court:** Applicability of 1964 vs 1997 Rules of Court was disputed but ultimately decided to apply the 1997 Rules retroactively.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding that B & I Realty's action for judicial foreclosure had prescribed. The Court emphasized the importance of timely filing suit and properly preserving legal rights. It highlights the risks associated with delayed legal action and emphasizes the need to assert claims promptly.
