## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 168787 and G.R. No. 169271

**Case Name:** *Department of Agrarian Reform vs. Polo Coconut Plantation Co., Inc., et al.*

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision regarding the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) over land owned by Polo Coconut Plantation Co., Inc. (PCPCI).

**Key Issue:** Whether the land owned by PCPCI was validly placed under CARP coverage, despite reclassification efforts and PEZA endorsement as part of a potential ecozone. Whether the identified beneficiaries are qualified under CARP.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision, reinstating the orders of the Regional Agrarian Reform Adjudicator (RARAD) and validating the Certificate of Land Ownership Award.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Non-Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** PCPCI failed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing certiorari in the CA. Specifically, it did not file a protest with the DAR Secretary regarding the CARP coverage or the eligibility of the beneficiaries, violating Section 3, Rule II of the 2003 DARAB Rules of Procedure. Cites *Board of Commissioners v. de la Rosa* (274 Phil. 1156 (1991)). The SC points out that recoursing to the DAR Secretary was a speedy and adequate remedy and certiorari is only available in the absence of an appeal.
*   **Non-Conversion to Mixed Use:** While Tanjay reclassified the land as mixed residential, commercial, and industrial, this was insufficient to remove it from CARP coverage. Cites *Ros v. DAR* (G.R. No. 132477, 31 August 2005, 468 SCRA 471). DAR approval is a condition precedent to conversion for ecozone purposes, citing RA 7916 Sec. 5 and DAR Administrative Order No. 1, s. 1999, Sec. 6(e) in relation to PEZA endorsement of the property as an ecozone, per Resolution No. 98-320 and Rule IV, Section 3. Land Use Conversion Clearance Certificate from the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Certification from the Department of Agriculture (DA) are required to be submitted directly to PEZA to be considered for Presidential Proclamation. Also, Section 20 of the Local Government Code requires reclassification via ordinance, not just resolution. Cites *Municipality of Para√±aque v. V.M. Realty Corporation*, G.R. 127820.
*   **Qualification of CARP Beneficiaries:** The Court upheld DAR's selection of CARP beneficiaries, even if they weren't tenants, as it is within the DAR Secretary's administrative function under Section 22 of the CARL. Section 22 of the CARL does not limit qualified beneficiaries to tenants of the landowners. Cites *Joson v. Mendoza* (G.R. No. 144705, 25 August 2005, 468 SCRA 95, 105-107).

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Compliance Issues:** PCPCI's failure to obtain DAR approval for land conversion poses a significant risk. The lack of proper procedures for exemption from CARP rendered its reclassification incomplete, and any investment based on such reclassification is potentially insecure.
*   **Litigation Exposure:** Continued resistance to CARP implementation could lead to further legal challenges and potential liabilities for PCPCI, including costs associated with evicting beneficiaries (if applicable).
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Resisting agrarian reform can create negative publicity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and implementation of PEZA Resolution No. 98-320, specifically the condition requiring "all government clearances," was a point of contention. The SC interpreted this condition as not automatically converting the land but instead as the property remaining agricultural land still subject to CARP.
*   The definition and scope of "farmworkers" eligible as CARP beneficiaries under Section 22 of the CARL could be argued.

**Conclusion:**

The SC ruled in favor of the DAR, holding that the PCPCI land was validly placed under CARP. This decision reinforces the requirement for DAR approval for land conversions and upholds the DAR Secretary's authority in determining qualified beneficiaries. The key to the outcome was PCPCI's failure to follow the legally required procedures for land conversion and its failure to exhaust administrative remedies within the DAR system before seeking judicial relief.
