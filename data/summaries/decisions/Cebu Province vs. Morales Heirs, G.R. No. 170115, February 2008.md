**Legal Document Summary: *Province of Cebu v. Heirs of Rufina Morales* (G.R. No. 170115, February 19, 2008)**

**Core Issue:** Specific performance and reconveyance of land (Lot No. 646-A-3) originally leased by the Province of Cebu to Rufina Morales, subsequently donated to the City of Cebu, sold to Morales at public auction, and then erroneously returned to the Province of Cebu via a compromise agreement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Lease Agreement (1961):** Province of Cebu leased the original lot to Rufina Morales.
*   **Donation (1964):** Province donated the lot to the City of Cebu.
*   **Public Auction (1965):** City of Cebu sold the lot to Morales after she matched the highest bid, establishing a *perfected contract of sale* under Art. 1475, 1458 of the Civil Code. Morales made a deposit and partial payment.
*   **Compromise Agreement (1974):** In Civil Case No. 238-BC, the Province and City agreed to return donated lots to the Province, *except those already utilized by the City.* Lot 646-A-3 was erroneously included and registered under TCT No. 104310 to the Province.
*   **Heirs' Claim (1983/1986):** Morales' heirs requested conveyance of the lot, followed by legal action (Civil Case No. CEB-11140) for specific performance and reconveyance. The heirs consigned the remaining balance.

**Obligations:**

*   **City of Cebu:** Had an obligation to convey clear title to Morales upon full payment. This obligation, and the resulting liability, was transferred to the Province of Cebu as the City's successor-in-interest.
*   **Province of Cebu:** Is bound by the perfected and partially consummated contract of sale between the City of Cebu and Morales. The court found no grounds for rescission initiated by the Province, so that the right to receive the payments still existed when the heirs consigned the balance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Province of Cebu:** Found liable for specific performance and is ordered to convey the lot to Morales' heirs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Laches/Prescription:** *Though not raised below and therefore waived*, the Province *could* have argued laches or prescription, if circumstances of the case allowed, given the significant time elapsed between the sale (1965), the compromise agreement (1974), and the lawsuit (1983/1986).
*   **Defense Raised Late**: Prescription and Laches should have been raised at the lower court, since it was not, it was seen to be waived.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:** 1191 (rescission of obligations), 1458 (contract of sale elements), 1475 (perfection of sale), 1476(2)(public auction perfection), 1483 (form of sale contract), 1592 (rescission in sale of immovables).
*   **Buenaventura v. Court of Appeals, 461 Phil. 761, 772 (2003):** Failure to pay the balance of purchase price does not invalidate the sale, it allows right to demand specific performance or rescission
*   **City of Cebu v. Heirs of Candido Rubi, 366 Phil. 70, 78 (1999):** Confirmed the essentials of the contract of sale.
*   **San Miguel Properties Phils., Inc. v. Spouses Huang, 391 Phil. 636, 645 (2000):** Defined the stages of a contract of sale: negotiation, perfection, and consummation.
*   **Ramos v. Sarao, G.R. No. 149756, February 11, 2005, 451 SCRA 103, 122.:** Defenses and issues not raised below cannot be considered on appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The compromise agreement in Civil Case No. 238-BC was *not* explicit in excluding lots already sold by the City of Cebu. This ambiguity allowed the erroneous inclusion of Lot 646-A-3, prompting the present litigation.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions based on principles of contract law and succession-in-interest. The perfected sale between the City of Cebu and Rufina Morales, coupled with partial performance, created a binding obligation that the Province of Cebu inherited. The Province's failure to actively seek rescission of the sale before the heirs tendered full payment was fatal to its case. The heirs consigned the balance of the purchase price before the trial court which then operated as a full payment. Furthermore, the argument regarding prescription and laches was waived, since it was not raised in lower courts.
