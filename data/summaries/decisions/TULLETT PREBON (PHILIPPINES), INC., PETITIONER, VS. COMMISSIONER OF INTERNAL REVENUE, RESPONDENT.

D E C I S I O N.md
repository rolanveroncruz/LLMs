Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, focusing on key aspects relevant for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Tullett Prebon (Philippines), Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* G.R. No. 257219, July 15, 2024

**Subject:** Claim for refund of excess and unutilized Creditable Withholding Tax (CWT) for CY 2013.

**Holding:** CTA En Banc's denial of Tullett Prebon's claim for refund is *partly* reversed and set aside.  The case is remanded to the CTA Division for further proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec 229 NIRC**:  The claim must be filed within two years from the date of payment.
*   **RR No. 2-98, Sec. 2.58.3**: Outlines requirements for claiming tax credit or refund of withheld income tax.
    *   Requires that the income payment has been declared as part of the gross income.
    *   The fact of withholding is established by a copy of the withholding tax statement duly issued by the payor to the payee showing the amount paid and the amount of tax withheld therefrom.
*   **Burden of Proof**: Taxpayer bears the burden of proving entitlement to the refund by preponderance of evidence. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Univation Motor Phils., Inc., 851 Phil. 1078, 1090)
*   Tax returns are filed under pain of perjury and are taken at face value (Phil. Airlines, Inc. (PAL) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 823 Phil. 1043, 1087)

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Strict Construction Against Taxpayer**: Tax refunds are construed strictly against the taxpayer.
*   **CTA's Factual Findings**: Findings of fact by the CTA are generally respected if supported by substantial evidence. However, the Supreme Court found the CTA committed a grave error which warrants a second look at the evidence presented.
*   **Insufficient Documentation**:  CTA initially held that Tullett Prebon failed to sufficiently document the income reported on ITR in relation to the claimed CWT, specifically that the general ledger did not show the specific billing invoice number corresponding to the revenue amounts recorded therein.
*   **Prior Years' Excess Credits**:  CTA erred in disregarding prior years' excess credits and requiring the taxpayer to substantiate CWTs "from the time of its incorporation."

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), Sections 204, 229**: Governs claims for refund of taxes.
*   **Revenue Regulation No. 2-98, Section 2.58.3**:  Implements withholding tax provisions and requirements for refunds/tax credits.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Univation Motor Phils., Inc., 851 Phil. 1078, 1091 (2019)**: Outlines the three requisites in order to prove entitlement to a claim for refund of excess and unutilized CWT
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Bank of Communications, G.R. No. 211348, February 23, 2022** The sufficiency of a claimantâ€™s evidence and the determination of the amount of refund are questions of fact
*   **Mannasoft Technology Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 244202, July 10, 2023** It is not the function of the Court to again analyze or weigh evidence that has already been duly considered by the courts a quo
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Vestas Services Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 255085, March 29, 2023**The findings of facts of the CTA, when supported by substantial evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Co, 871 Phil. 862, 882 (2020)** Cases before the CTA are litigated de novo and that parties "should prove every minute aspect of their cases."
*   **Republic Act No. 8424 (1997), sec. 267**, Tax Reform Act of 1997. Tax returns are filed under pain of perjury
*   **Phil. Airlines, Inc. (PAL) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 823 Phil. 1043, 1087 (2018)**, Tax returns are taken at face value
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. De La Salle Univ., Inc., 799 Phil. 141, 178 (2016)** Rules of procedure should not preclude courts from considering undisputed facts to arrive at a just ruling.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Proof of Income Reporting**: No specific form or requirement for proving that income payments relating to the CWT was included in the total gross income reported.
*   **ICPA Report**: CTA is not bound by the ICPA's report but must still judiciously consider evidence.
*   **Submission of Additional Evidence**:  Denial of Tullett Prebon to submit the expanded ledger in its motion for reconsideration was erroneous.

**Key Arguments & Court Rationale:**

1.  **Sufficiency of Evidence of Income Reporting**: The Supreme Court found the CTA erred in dismissing the taxpayer's evidence simply because invoice numbers weren't in the general ledger. Preponderance of evidence standard should be considered. The fact that the reported revenue in its ITR exceeds the total amount of income payments subjected to CWT should prompt the CTA to be more circumspect in its evaluation of the evidence on record. The taxpayer should be allowed to present the expanded general ledger.
2.  **Prior Years' Credits**:  The Supreme Court held it was erroneous to discount prior credits for CY 2011 in deciding whether the credits earned by Tullett Prebon in 2011 could be carried over to 2012. It may be inferred from the foregoing that the income tax returns themselves constitute sufficient proof of the previous period's excess tax credits

**Practical Implications:**

*   Provides guidance on the evidence required to prove a claim for refund of excess and unutilized CWT.
*   Emphasizes that the CTA should not apply overly strict standards when assessing a taxpayer's compliance with the requirement that income has been declared as part of the gross income
*   Clarifies the use of prior years' tax returns to prove excess credits.
*   Remand emphasizes that the CTA should reconsider the evidence with the correct legal standards.
