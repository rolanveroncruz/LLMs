*   **R.A. 9262, Section 5(a):** Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 (one of the cases Valdez failed to handle).
*   **Citation of *In re Basa*, 41 Phil. 275, 276 (1920) and *In re Gutierrez*, AC No. L-363, July 31, 1962, 5 SCRA 661:** to define deceitful conduct involving moral turpitude.
*   **Citation of Barnachea v. Quiocho, A.C. No. 5925, March 11, 2003, 399 SCRA 1 and Sencio v. Calvadores, A.C. No. 5841, January 20, 2003, 395 SCRA 393**  Return of money entrusted to a lawyer who failed to provide services.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Valdez's defenses:** The document reflects ex parte proceedings. Valdez's potential defenses are absent.
*   **Currency conversion:** The fluctuating exchange rate between USD and PHP could lead to disputes regarding the exact amount to be returned.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the disbarment and restitution order may require further legal action, especially if Valdez is uncooperative.

**Conclusion:** This case establishes clear precedent for disbarment in instances of egregious neglect, dishonesty, and abandonment by an attorney. The court emphasizes the fiduciary duty owed to clients and the consequences for breaching that duty. The ex parte nature of the proceedings warrants caution in assessing the full factual picture.
