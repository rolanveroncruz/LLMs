## Legal Document Summary: People v. Araneta, G.R. No. 125894 (1998)

**Case Summary:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' modification of the trial court's ruling, finding Accused-Appellant Narito Araneta guilty of MURDER (qualified by abuse of superior strength) for the death of Mansueto Datoon, Jr. and sentencing him to *Reclusion Perpetua*. The Court of Appeals acquitted him of Frustrated Homicide (Criminal Case No. 34643) regarding the wounding of Hilario Malones.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Guilty of Murder:** The court finds Narito Araneta guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as the killing was qualified by abuse of superior strength.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Indemnification:** Ordered to pay the heirs of Mansueto Datoon, Jr. P50,000.00 as indemnity and P35,000.00 as actual damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Narito Araneta is criminally liable for the murder of Mansueto Datoon, Jr.
*   **Civil Liability:** Narito Araneta is civilly liable for the death of Mansueto Datoon, Jr. and is obligated to pay damages to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy:** The finding of conspiracy is based on circumstantial evidence and inference from actions before, during, and after the crime. The defense argued lack of participation in the actual shooting. This argument was rejected by the court based on the doctrine that the act of one conspirator is the act of all.
*   **Alibi vs. Positive Identification:** The defense presented an alibi, which was rejected due to inconsistencies in the testimonies of corroborating witnesses (Nelson Salo and Candelaria Araneta) and the strength of the positive identification by prosecution witnesses (Hilario and Fe Malones).
*   **Jumping Bail:** Araneta jumped bail after the Court of Appeals decision. While the Supreme Court could have dismissed the appeal, it chose to proceed to prevent injustice, acknowledging that dismissing the appeal would result in the lower court decision standing, potentially benefiting the defendant due to the CA's acquittal of the frustrated homicide charge.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Murder (Art. 248)
*   Revised Rules of Court: Rule 124, Section 13 (certification of case to Supreme Court); Section 8 (Dismissal of appeal for abandonment or failure to prosecute.)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The court cites numerous cases to support its rulings on alibi, positive identification, conspiracy, the role of motive, and the effect of non-flight. Examples include:
    *   *People vs. Perez, 265 SCRA 506 (1996)*, on the weakness of alibi.
    *   *People vs. Laurente, 255 SCRA 543 (1996)*, on proving conspiracy.
    *   *People vs. Codilla, 224 SCRA 104 (1993)*, on the discretion of the court to dismiss the appeal in case of escape.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The conviction hinges heavily on the credibility of the witnesses and the interpretation of their testimonies, particularly regarding the participation of Narito Araneta in the beating *before* and *after* the shooting. The determination of whether Narito's actions sufficiently established conspiracy could be challenged.
