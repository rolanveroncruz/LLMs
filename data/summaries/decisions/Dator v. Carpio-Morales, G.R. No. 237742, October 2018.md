## Legal Document Summary: *Dator v. Carpio-Morales*

**Document:** G.R. No. 237742, October 8, 2018 (841 Phil. 655)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Resolution denying a Petition for Injunction.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Celso Olivier T. Dator (Mayor of Lucban, Quezon)
*   **Respondents:** Conchita Carpio-Morales (Ombudsman), Gerard A. Mosquera (Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon), and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG).

**Core Issue:** Validity of the Ombudsman's decision finding Dator administratively liable for Simple Misconduct for hiring his sister, Macandile, as Chief Administrative Officer without proper appointment and in violation of nepotism rules.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Ombudsman Decision:**
    *   Dator found liable for Simple Misconduct for hiring his sister, Macandile, as Chief Administrative Officer through a Job Order and Special Order (S.O.) without Sangguniang Bayan confirmation, bypassing the regular appointment process under Sec. 443(d) of the Local Government Code (LGC).
    *   Macandile's position deemed to require compliance with Sec. 480 of the LGC (qualifications for Municipal Administrator), despite not being formally included in the municipality's plantilla.
    *   Job Order declaration of no consanguinity to hiring authority deemed false and a violation of standards expected of a government official.
    *   Original Penalty: Six (6) months suspension without pay (later footnoted as one month and one day suspension) pursuant to Section 10, Rule III, Administrative Order No. 07, as amended by Administrative Order No. 17 in relation to Section 25 of Republic Act No. 6770.
*   **CA Ruling:**
    *   Dismissed Dator's Petition for Injunction, citing lack of jurisdiction for original actions for injunction and the proper remedy being an appeal under Rule 43.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   Partly granted Dator's Petition for Review.
    *   Held that the CA should have considered the peculiar circumstances of conflicting penalties, justifying an urgent resolution given the public interest in the proper suspension length (1 month vs 6).
    *   Found forum shopping due to Dator's simultaneous filing of a Petition for Injunction and Petition for Review with the CA, both challenging the Ombudsman's decision. However, the SC deemed the forum shopping not willful or deliberate and only dismissed the Petition for Review before the CA.
    *   Denied Dator's request for an injunctive writ, stating there is no vested right to public office. Citing *P/S Insp. Belmonte, et. al. vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and other Law Enforcement Offices, etc.* 778 Phil. 221 (2016), held that the Ombudsman decisions are immediately executory. Any lost salary during suspension would be reimbursed if he wins on appeal.
    *   Declares the Condonation Doctrine inapplicable as the case was instituted AFTER the ruling of this Court in the seminal case of *Conchita Carpio Morales vs. CA and Jejomar Erwin S. Binay, Jr.* 772 Phil. 672 (2015).
    *   Affirmed Ombudsman's finding of Simple Misconduct but reduced the penalty to one month and one day suspension, citing good faith as a mitigating circumstance based on prior similar appointments by the previous administration.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6770:** The Ombudsman Act of 1989
*   **Civil Service Commission (CSC) Rules:** CSC MC No. 40, s. 1998 (Revised Omnibus Rules on Appointments), CSC Resolution No. 020790 (Policy Guidelines for Contract of Services).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 43 (appeals from quasi-judicial agencies).

**Case Law References:**

*   ***Carpio Morales v. CA and Jejomar Binay, Jr.***, 772 Phil. 672 (2015) - Abandoned the Condonation Doctrine.
*   ***P/S Insp. Belmonte, et. al. vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and other Law Enforcement Offices, etc.*** 778 Phil. 221 (2016) - immediate execution of Ombudsman decisions.
*   ***Yamson, et al. vs. Castro, et al.***, 790 Phil. 667 (2016) - discussed the rule on forum shopping

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Celso Olivier T. Dator:** Liable for Simple Misconduct and subject to a one month and one day suspension from office without pay.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Challenges:** The case confirms the non-applicability of the condonation doctrine for cases instituted after *Carpio Morales v. CA*, increasing the risk of liability for past administrative offenses.
*   **Procedural Rigidity:** The ruling highlights the strict interpretation of Civil Service rules regarding appointments and the potential for liability when circumventing established procedures.
*   **Enforcement of Penalty:** The immediate executory nature of the Ombudsman's decision, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, makes the mayor vulnerable to immediate suspension.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The seemingly conflicting penalties (six months vs one month and one day) initially imposed by the Ombudsman, highlighting a potential for arbitrary enforcement. The Supreme Court did clarify and reduce the penalty, mitigating this risk.
*   The classification of the Municipal Administrator position. The municipality did not include it in their official plantilla, yet the Ombudsman ruled that the position still required meeting the required qualifications. The case shows that municipalities cannot create "de facto" position without legal authority by simply assigning administrative roles to other persons via job orders or special orders.
