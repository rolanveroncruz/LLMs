## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Nestor and Ma. Nona Borromeo vs. Court of Appeals and Equitable Savings Bank*

**Case:** G.R. No. 169846, March 28, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari, assailing CA decision reversing RTC order to issue Preliminary Injunction.

**Key Issue:** Whether a preliminary injunction should issue to enjoin the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgaged property pending resolution of a dispute over the creditor-mortgagee's identity and validity of the REM.

**Facts:**

*   Sps. Borromeo (Petitioners) obtained a loan under the "Own-a-Home Loan Program," allegedly from Equitable PCI Bank (EPCIB).
*   Petitioners signed blank loan documents, including a Real Estate Mortgage (REM).
*   Dispute arose over the applicable interest rates and the alleged failure of EPCIB to provide copies of the loan documents.
*   Petitioners stopped payments, leading Equitable Savings Bank (ESB), a subsidiary of EPCIB, to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   Petitioners filed suit for Injunction and Annulment of Mortgage, claiming the loan agreement was with EPCIB, not ESB, and that interest rates were excessive.
*   RTC initially granted a preliminary injunction, but the CA reversed, finding the REM presumed valid.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **REM:** Secures loan obligation, but its validity and the identity of the creditor-mortgagee are contested.
*   **Loan Agreement & Promissory Notes:** Discrepancies exist. The REM and Loan Agreement designate ESB as the lender, while Promissory Notes indicate EPCIB.
*   **Payment Obligation:** Petitioners acknowledge the debt but contest the interest rates and the identity of the proper payee.
*  **Art. 1311 Civil Code:** Contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs.
*   **Foreclosure Right:** The right to foreclose is vested in the creditor-mortgagee and is subject to applicable foreclosure laws.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Foreclosure of Property:** Significant risk for the petitioners if ESB is deemed the proper creditor-mortgagee.
*   **Debt Accumulation:** Interest continues to accrue while the dispute is unresolved.
*   **ESB's Lack of Privity:** ESB attempting to enforce a contract to which it was arguably not a party (per Article 1311, Civil Code) presents a risk of invalid foreclosure.
*   **Surety Bond:**  The 3.5 Million Pesos bond by the petitioners could be lost if court declares the property was properly foreclosed.
*   **Parent-Subsidiary Liability:** Potential issue of piercing the corporate veil between EPCIB and ESB, although the court recognizes their separate juridical personalities.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the issuance of preliminary injunctions.
*   **Article 1311, Civil Code:** Principle of relativity of contracts. Contracts bind the parties, their assigns and heirs.
*   *Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank, Inc.* and similar cases:  Acknowledges distinct legal personalities of subsidiary and parent company.
* *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals* and similar cases: Foreclosure is proper when the debtors are in default of the payment of their obligation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identity of Creditor-Mortgagee:**  The central dispute. The loan documents are inconsistent on whether EPCIB or ESB is the lender.
*   **Interest Rate:** Petitioners claim a lower agreed-upon rate than reflected in the Promissory Notes.
*   **Blank Loan Documents:** The signing of blank documents opens the door to allegations of overreaching and misrepresentation.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision.  The crucial point is that the identity of the creditor-mortgagee is genuinely disputed.  The inconsistency in the loan documents, the historical dealings with EPCIB, and the application of the principle of relativity of contracts (Article 1311, Civil Code) support the RTC's initial decision to grant the preliminary injunction.  The Court emphasized this ruling is only to determine the propriety of a preliminary injunction, and the RTC must ultimately decide the creditor-mortgagee after trial. The potential injustice of a wrongful foreclosure outweighs any prejudice to ESB, given the value of the property and the surety bond.
