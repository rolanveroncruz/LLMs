## Legal Document Summary: ARCAJI v. DBM (G.R. No. 210204)

**Document Type:** Decision of the Supreme Court (En Banc)

**Case Summary:** The Association of Retired Court of Appeals Justices, Inc. (ARCAJI) filed a petition for mandamus against the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) seeking the release of funds for retirement gratuity differentials for 28 retired CA Justices. These differentials stem from salary increases granted to incumbent CA Justices *after* the retirees' retirement dates but within the 5-year period after their retirement, based on SSL 2 and SSL 3 implementations.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 910 (as amended by RA 1797 & RA 9946):** This is the central statute governing retirement benefits for justices.
    *   **Section 3:** Provides for a lump sum gratuity of 5 years' worth of pension benefits based on the highest monthly salary and allowances *at the time of retirement*.
    *   **Section 3-A:** *Crucially*, states that "all pension benefits of retired members of the Judiciary shall be automatically increased whenever there is an increase in the salary of the same position from which he/she retired."
    *   **Section 3-B:** States that benefits shall be granted to those who retired prior to the effectivity of the act, but the benefits shall be prospective.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:**  The retired Justices argue that salary increases given to incumbent Justices during the 5-year period after their retirement should be included in their retirement gratuity. They cite A.M. No. 91-8-225-CA to support that their lump sum payment of 5 years gratuity is actually payment for the 60 monthly pensions during the period of five (5) years from date of retirement.
*   **DBM's Argument:** DBM denied the claim, arguing:
    *   RA 910 distinguishes between the lump sum gratuity and the subsequent monthly pension. Only the pension is subject to automatic increases *after* the 5-year gratuity period.
    *   The increases are partially attributable to the Special Allowance for the Judiciary (SAJ) component, which should be funded by the SAJ Fund, not the Pension and Gratuity Fund.
    *   The General Appropriations Act (GAA) specifies that only personnel benefits costs charged against the General Fund can be sourced from it.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court granted the petition for mandamus.
    *   **Mandamus Lies:** DBM has a legal duty under RA 910, as amended, to pay the salary increases granted to incumbents during the 5-year period. A.M. No. 91-8-225-CA supports this.
    *   **Entitlement to Differentials:** Retired justices are entitled to increases in salary granted to incumbents during the 5 years after retirement. The lump sum gratuity is considered an *advance* payment of 60 monthly pensions.
    *   **Pension and Gratuity Fund is the Proper Source:** Even if SAJ is part of the gratuity, the correct funding source remains the Pension and Gratuity Fund. Any retirement gratuity portion that had not been fully converted to BMS, such component can still not be sourced from the SAJ Fund, owing to the nature of the SAJ Fund as a special fund.

**Obligations:**

*   **DBM:** Obligated to issue a Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) to cover the retirement gratuity differentials.

**Liabilities:**

*   DBM's refusal to issue the SARO and NCA constitutes grave abuse of discretion, making them liable to be compelled to act via mandamus.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Future Salary Increases:** Although the Court addresses the issue of implementing the special provisions of subsequent GAAs prohibiting the funding of the SAJ component of the retirement gratuity from the Pension and Gratuity Fund, the impact of future legislative or executive changes to salary standardization or the treatment of SAJ allowances remains a potential source of conflict.
*   **Computational Disputes:** The specific calculation of differentials for each justice may be subject to dispute if the DBM disagrees with the Court of Appeals' calculations as they have not been explicitly adopted by the Supreme Court.
*   **Continued Litigation:**  This decision may spur other retired justices/judges to seek similar adjustments.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 910 (as amended by RA 1797 & RA 9946):** Cornerstone of the ruling.
*   **A.M. No. 91-8-225-CA:** Provides critical interpretation of RA 910, affirming that the lump sum payment is advance pension.
*   **A.M. No. 04-7-05-SC:** Clarifies the nature of SAJ as a special fund.
*   **A.M. No. 07-5-10-SC & A.M. No. 07-8-03-SC:** Directs that the SAJ component be sourced from the Pension and Gratuity Fund.
*   **Uy Kiao Eng v. Nixon Lee:** Defines Mandamus
*   **Bengzon v. Drilon** Cites that government can not deprive retirees of their vested right to the payment of their pensions.
*   **Santiago v. Commission on Audit:** Retirement laws should be interpreted liberally in favor of the retiree.
