## Legal Document Summary: *Buebos v. People*, G.R. No. 163938 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a CA decision affirming a RTC decision finding Petitioners guilty of arson.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Crime:** Arson. Originally charged under an unspecified provision of P.D. 1613, prosecuted for arson of an inhabited dwelling.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to establish guilt. The court found that there was more than one circumstance and that the combination of all of them results in a moral certainty that the accused, to the exclusion of all others, is the one who has committed the crime.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court affirmed the presence of conspiracy among the accused based on coordinated actions and concerted behavior.
*   **Sentence:** The RTC originally sentenced the accused to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*. The CA modified this to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years of *prision correccional* to ten (10) years of *prision mayor*, based on the charge being for simple arson.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original RTC Finding:** All accused found guilty of arson.
*   **CA Modification:** Upheld the guilty verdict but modified the penalty, finding the accused guilty of simple arson under Section 1 of P.D. 1613.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the CA decision in full.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Information Defect:** The *Information* lacked specific allegations, particularly failing to state that the burned house was "inhabited." This omission proved critical.
*   **Retroactive Application of Procedural Rules:** The Supreme Court applied Sections 8 and 9 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure retroactively, benefiting the accused by ensuring a conviction only for the crime properly alleged in the *Information*.
*   **Ambiguity in P.D. 1613:** The case highlights the historical confusion surrounding arson laws, due to multiple amendments and the interplay between the Revised Penal Code and Presidential Decrees.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 1613:** The primary statute governing simple arson.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Articles 320-326b):** Initially governed arson but were superseded by P.D. 1613. Note that destructive arson remains within the RPC.
*   **R.A. No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law):** Relevant historically, as it impacted penalties for destructive arson.
*   **R.A. No. 9346 (Repeal of Death Penalty Law):** Removed the death penalty for arson.
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence, Rule 133, Sec. 5:** Deals with the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence.
*   **Rules of Court, Sections 8 and 9:** Relate to the necessary contents of the complaint or information.
*   **People v. Soriano, G.R. No. 142565 (2003):** Similar case where the Court reduced the conviction from destructive arson to simple arson due to the ambiguity of the designation of the offence in the information
*   **People v. Malngan, G.R. No. 170470 (2006):** An analogous case where the Supreme Court analyzed the distinction between Destructive Arson under Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended) and Simple Arson under Presidential Decree No. 1613.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of the Petitioners for arson. The CA's modification of the sentence to reflect a conviction for simple arson, rather than arson of an inhabited dwelling, was upheld. The decision hinges on the failure of the *Information* to specifically allege that the burned structure was an inhabited house. While circumstantial evidence and the existence of conspiracy were established, the Court strictly construed the *Information* against the prosecution, applying procedural rules retroactively to benefit the accused. Therefore, only simple arson was proven.
