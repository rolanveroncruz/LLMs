## Legal Document Summary: *Yap v. People*, G.R. No. 234217

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a CA decision that affirmed an RTC conviction for Attempted Murder.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **partially granted** the petition, modifying the conviction to **Slight Physical Injuries** under Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Attempted Murder (Art. 248, in relation to Art. 6, RPC):** The RTC and CA initially convicted Yap of attempted murder for allegedly drugging and hitting the victim, Ang, with a rolling pin.
*   **Self-Defense:** Yap invoked self-defense during pre-trial, admitting to the act but claiming justification. This shifted the burden of proof to Yap to demonstrate unlawful aggression by Ang, reasonable necessity of the means used to repel it, and lack of sufficient provocation.
*   **Slight Physical Injuries (Art. 266, RPC):** The SC found the evidence insufficient to prove intent to kill, a necessary element for Attempted Murder, but sufficient to establish the lesser included offense of slight physical injuries. The SC notes the superficial nature of the wounds and the absence of evidence that the victim was incapacitated for labor, or required medical attention for more than nine days.
*   **Moral Damages:** Awarded to the victim for mental anguish.

**Liabilities and Penalties:**

*   Initially, the RTC sentenced Yap to imprisonment from Four (4) Years and Two (2) months, as minimum, to Eight (8) years as the maximum penalty and to pay the complainant the sum of P18,287.00 as actual damages and P20,000.00 as moral damages.
*   As modified by the SC: Yap is sentenced to fifteen (15) days of *arresto menor* and ordered to pay P5,000.00 in moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Counsel's Error:** Yap argued ineffective assistance of counsel due to the invocation of self-defense. The SC rejected this argument, holding that the client is generally bound by counsel's mistakes unless it constitutes egregious negligence that prejudiced the client's interest and denied him his day in court. The Court notes that it was not raised in the lower court, and that Yap actively participated in the proceedings. This raises a potential issue of waiver.
*   **Treachery:** The prosecution alleged treachery as a qualifying circumstance for murder. The SC found this unproven because there was no conclusive proof that the victim was unconscious or unable to defend himself during the attack. The court emphasized the prosecution's failure to prove the sleep-inducing drug had that effect.
*   **Intent to Kill:** The absence of a deadly weapon, the superficial nature of the wounds, and the lack of clear evidence of intent to kill were critical to overturning the attempted murder conviction. This underscores the importance of proving *mens rea* in criminal cases.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 6, 248, 266.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amendment to Article 248 of the RPC.
*   **Self-Defense:** *People v. Lalongisip*, 635 Phil. 163, 171 (2010)
*   **Burden of Proof in Self-Defense:** *Velasquez, et al. v. People*, 807 Phil. 438, 449 (2017).
*   **Intent to Kill:** *De Guzman, Jr. v. People*, 748 Phil. 452, 458 (2014).
*   **Treachery:** *People v. Ortiz, Jr.*, 638 Phil. 521, 527 (2010).
*   **Client Bound by Counsel's Conduct** *Pascual, et al. v. People, 606 Phil. 451, 461 (2009).*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly overturned the conviction for attempted murder due to insufficient evidence of intent to kill and failure to prove treachery. The SC's finding of slight physical injuries and subsequent penalty are consistent with the evidence presented. However, the SC's rejection of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim without a more thorough examination of the circumstances surrounding the invocation of self-defense could be viewed as problematic, as it potentially penalizes the defendant for counsel's errors.
