**Legal Document Summary: *Myrna Gomez Stewart v. Atty. Crisaldo R. Rioflorido***

**Case:** A.C. No. 13982, July 17, 2024 (Formerly CBD Case No. 19-5970)

**Complainant:** Myrna Gomez Stewart

**Respondent:** Atty. Crisaldo R. Rioflorido

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Engagement:** Stewart engaged Atty. Rioflorido to handle cases of violation of R.A. 9262 (Violence Against Women and Children Act) and concubinage against her husband.
*   **Fees:** Stewart paid Atty. Rioflorido PHP 130,000.00 in legal fees.
*   **Lack of Diligence:** Atty. Rioflorido failed to provide updates on the status of the cases despite repeated inquiries from Stewart.  He was generally unresponsive.
*   **Failure to Return Documents/Funds:** Upon termination of the engagement, Atty. Rioflorido failed to return Stewart's documents and the unused portion of the legal fees despite formal demand.
*   **Misappropriation:** The Supreme Court Presumes misappropriation of funds due to Atty. Rioflorido's failure to return the money.

**Violations/Liabilities:**

*   **Canon IV, Section 6 CPRA:** Failure to update the client on the status of the case (Simple Negligence). Cited *Gabucan v. Atty. Narido, Jr.*, *Tan v. Diamante*, *Sps. Montecillo v. Atty. Gatchalian*, *Calisay v. Atty. Esplana*.
*   **Canon III, Sections 49 and 56 CPRA:** Failure to account for and turn over documents and funds upon termination of engagement (Unjustifiable Failure to Render Accounting).
*   **Canon VI, Section 33(g) CPRA:** Misappropriation of client funds. Cites *Bondoc v. Atty. Licudine* and *Romo v. Atty. Ferrer*, establishing the duty to return unearned fees and the presumption of misappropriation upon failure to do so.
*   **Multiple Offenses:** The Court cites Canon VI, Section 40 of the CPRA to justify imposing separate penalties for each offense.

**Sanctions:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for a total of two (2) years (6 months for failure to render legal services and failure to update the client, 6 months for failure to render accounting, and 1 year for misappropriation).
*   Order to return PHP 130,000.00 to Stewart, with legal interest at 6% per annum from the date of the Decision until full payment.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Explicit Finding of "Gross Misconduct":** While the Court imposes a relatively severe penalty, the specific classification of the misconduct and its long-term implications for the attorney's record should be assessed.
*   **Enforcement of Restitution:** Enforcing the order to return the funds may require further legal action if Atty. Rioflorido fails to comply voluntarily.
*   **Reinstatement Conditions:** The decision does not explicitly state the conditions for reinstatement after the suspension period, requiring further inquiry.
*   **Aggravating/Mitigating Circumstances:** The decision focuses primarily on the violations. A review for any potential mitigating (e.g., illness, personal hardship) or aggravating circumstances is warranted, although the court is unlikely to give much weight to such factors given the breach of trust involved.
