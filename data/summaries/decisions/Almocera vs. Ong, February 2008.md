## Legal Document Summary: Almocera v. Ong, G.R. No. 170479

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's ruling holding petitioner Almocera and FBMC solidarily liable for damages arising from a Contract to Sell.

**Key Facts:**

*   Ong (Buyer) entered into a Contract to Sell with FBMC (Seller), represented by Almocera (Chairman/CEO), for a townhouse unit.
*   Ong paid P1,060,000.00 as down payment.
*   FBMC failed to complete construction within the stipulated six months.
*   Prior to the contract, the property was mortgaged to LBP, a fact concealed from Ong.
*   LBP foreclosed the mortgage due to FBMC's default, and the property was sold at public auction.
*   Ong sued for damages due to fraudulent concealment and breach of contract.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract to Sell:**  Document establishes a conditional sale, ownership remains with FBMC until full payment (citing *Serrano v. Caguiat*, G.R. No. 139173).
*   **Payment Terms:** P1,000,000 Downpayment with P2,400,000 balance upon completion and acceptance.
*   **Completion Date:** Completion and conveyance within six months of contract signing.

**Obligations:**

*   **FBMC/Almocera:**  Complete and deliver the townhouse unit within six months of the contract date. Disclosure of the mortgage on the property.
*   **Ong:**  Pay the remaining P2,400,000 upon completion, delivery, and acceptance of the townhouse.

**Liabilities:**

*   **FBMC/Almocera:** Liable for damages due to delay (Art. 1169, Civil Code), fraudulent concealment of the mortgage (Art. 1170, Civil Code) and breach of contract. The court ordered solidary payment of the down payment, interest, moral damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** Almocera is held solidarily liable with FBMC, potentially exposing his personal assets to cover the judgment.  The "piercing the corporate veil" defense was raised too late, not preserved at trial, and thus waived on appeal.
*   **Fraud:** Finding of fraud increases potential for punitive damages and affects reputation.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:**  Failure to return the down payment would constitute unjust enrichment (doctrine elements met).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 1169:**  Delay in reciprocal obligations.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1170:**  Liability for fraud and contravention of contract terms.
*   **Serrano v. Caguiat, G.R. No. 139173:** Defines Contract to Sell vs. Contract of Sale
*  ***Agustin v. Court of Appeals*** **G.R. No. 84751**, failure of one party to assume obligations means other party does not incur delay.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Petitionerâ€™s argument that there was no demand to fulfill the obligation:** The court held the argument to be inconsequential as they did not pay their obligations to the LBP resulting in the foreclosure of the property.
*   **Defense of Corporate Veil:** Defense not timely raised at the trial court level resulting in a holding for the Plaintiff (Ong)
