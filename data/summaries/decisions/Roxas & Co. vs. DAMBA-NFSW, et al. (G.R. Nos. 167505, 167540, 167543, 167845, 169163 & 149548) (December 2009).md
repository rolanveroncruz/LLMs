## Legal Document Summary - Roxas & Co. vs. DAMBA-NFSW et al. (622 Phil. 37)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions concerning the application by Roxas & Co., Inc. (Roxas & Co.) for conversion of its three haciendas from agricultural to non-agricultural use, and related CARP coverage issues.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Presidential Proclamation (PP) 1520:** The central dispute revolves around the interpretation of PP 1520, which declared the Municipalities of Maragondon, Ternate, and Nasugbu as a tourist zone. Roxas & Co. argued that this PP automatically reclassified all lands within these municipalities to non-agricultural uses, exempting them from CARP.
    *   **Court's Holding:** PP 1520 did *not* automatically convert agricultural lands. It merely recognized the *potential* tourism value and directed the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) to identify specific geographic areas for tourism development. Absent such identification, the lands remain subject to CARP.
    *   **Statutory References:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), Section 3(c), Presidential Decree 564, Tourism Act of 2009.
    *   **Relevant Case Law:** Distinguished *Natalia Realty v. DAR* and *NHA v. Allarde* as involving specifically defined townsite reservations, inapplicable until the PTA delineates specific tourism areas. Affirmed *DAR v. Franco* as supportive that the DAR Regional Office in coordination with the Philippine Tourism Authority, has to determine precisely which areas are for tourism development and excluded from the Operation Land Transfer and the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program
    *   **Risks/Ambiguities:**  The scope of PP 1520 and the actual role of the PTA in delineating specific areas were primary sources of ambiguity.

*   **Nasugbu Municipal Zoning Ordinance (MZO) No. 4:** Roxas & Co. alternatively argued that MZO No. 4 (1982) reclassified certain lots in Hacienda Palico to non-agricultural use before CARP's effectivity, exempting them.
    *   **Court's Analysis:** The Court acknowledged the power of LGUs to reclassify land before CARL.  However, discrepancies in the location and identity of the specific parcels of land within Hacienda Palico caused the Court to deny exemption for some lots (subject of DAR Administrative Case No. A-9999-142-97 - G.R. No. 179650).
    *   **Ambiguities:** Lack of consistent documentation identifying which DAR Lot numbers matched certain TCT’s and/or land use plan locations.
        *   For the parcels of land involved in DAR Administrative Case No. A-9999-008-98 (G.R. No. 167505), where sufficient evidence placed these nine lots within the residential cluster area as identified by the Municipal Zoning Ordinance, the claim for CARP exemption is sustained.

*   **Certificates of Land Ownership Award (CLOAs):** The validity of CLOAs issued by the DAR, specifically CLOA No. 6654, was challenged.
    *   **Court's Holding:** The Court upheld its previous ruling in *Roxas & Co. v. CA* that the DAR has primary jurisdiction to rule on the validity of CLOAs.  The Court permitted the cancellation of CLOAs covering the nine parcels for which exemption from the CARP was granted (identified as Lot Nos. 20, 13, 37, 19-B, 45, 47, 49, 48-1 and 48-2 within TCT No. 985). Roxas & Co. was ordered to pay disturbance compensation to affected farmer-beneficiaries.
    *   **Liabilities:** Roxas & Co. is liable for disturbance compensation to displaced farmer-beneficiaries.
    *   **Risk:** If the court ruled against Roxas & Co., it would be liable for the CARP process.

*   **Forum Shopping:**  The farmer organizations accused Roxas & Co. of forum shopping in pursuing multiple legal avenues for conversion/exemption.
    *   **Court's Determination:** The Court determined Roxas & Co. did not violate the rule against forum shopping.

**Key Holdings and Outcomes:**

1.  **G.R. No. 167540:** CA decision reversed; PP 1520 does not automatically reclassify all lands in Nasugbu.
2.  **G.R. No. 167543:** DAR's motion for reconsideration granted; prior Resolution reversed.
3.  **G.R. No. 149548:** Roxas & Co.'s petition denied for lack of merit, rendering issues moot with respect to all lots aside from the identified 9.
4.  **G.R. No. 179650:** DAMBA-NSFW's petition granted; CA decision reversed, denying CARP exemption for specified Hacienda Palico lots (subject of DAR Administrative Case No. A-9999-142-97 - except where specifically incorporated within the 9 designated lots).
5.  **G.R. No. 167505:** DAMBA-NSFW's petition denied; CA decision affirmed, granting CARP exemption to Roxas for designated Hacienda Palico lots (subject of DAR Administrative Case No. A-9999-008-98).
6.  **G.R. No. 167845:** Roxas & Co.'s petition denied; CA decision affirmed, allowing DAMBA-NFSW’s appeal for a full ventilation of their claim before the PARAD concerning parcels of land covered by the CLOA.
7.  **G.R. No. 169163:** Portions of PARAD’s decision relating to the original parcel are vacated.
8.  The Court ordered disturbance compensation to be paid to affected farmer-beneficiaries.

**Potential Risks and Ongoing Obligations for Roxas & Co.:**

*   **Disturbance Compensation:** Roxas & Co. is obligated to pay disturbance compensation to tenants on the nine parcels for which exemption was granted before CLOAs can be cancelled.
*   **Future Applications:** Any future application for CARP exemption will be evaluated under the current legal framework, including Tourism Act of 2009.
*   **Remaining CARPable lands:** Lands not explicitly exempted remain subject to CARP coverage.

**Advice Points:**

*   Ensure meticulous compliance with statutory frameworks as changes in the regulatory landscape would affect Roxas & Co.
*   Focus on managing disturbance compensation obligations and engaging constructively with tenant communities to mitigate social/legal risks.
*   Consult expert surveyors and legal professionals to clearly identify each designated parcel, eliminating any potential ambiguities.
