## Legal Document Summary: *Judge Ariel Florentino R. Dumlao, Jr. vs. Atty. Manuel N. Camacho* (A.C. No. 10498)

**Nature:** Disbarment case against Atty. Manuel N. Camacho for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and the Lawyer's Oath.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Influence Peddling & Attempted Bribery:** Atty. Camacho allegedly fraternized with the complainant Judge, dropped names of Supreme Court Justices (Sereno, Leonen) to create an impression of influence, and offered the Judge a portion of his attorney's fees in exchange for denying the opposing party's Notice of Appeal and issuing a writ of execution. He also attempted to influence Sheriff Nabua. This violates Canon 10, Rule 10.01, Canon 13, and Rule 13.01 of the CPR.
*   **Threatening Court Officers & Disrespecting Court Processes:** Atty. Camacho threatened the Judge with a disbarment case if he didn't rule in his favor and threatened Sheriff Nabua with dismissal if he refused to sign a garnishment order drafted by Camacho himself. He barged into the judge's chambers demanding action. This violates Canon 11, Rule 11.03, Canon 19, and Rule 19.01 of the CPR.
*   **Garnishment Irregularities:** The attempted garnishment order prepared by Atty. Camacho sought the release of a check far exceeding the amount awarded in the underlying court decision (RTC Order dated January 30, 2014), raising suspicions of impropriety.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty to uphold the integrity of the judiciary.
*   Duty to refrain from influencing the court improperly.
*   Duty to observe and maintain respect due to the courts and judicial officers.
*   Duty to employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of the client.
*   Duty to refrain from using scandalous, offensive, or menacing language or behavior before the Courts.
*   Duties under the Lawyers Oath.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Camacho was found GUILTY of violating Canons 10, 11, 13, 19 and Rules 10.01, 11.03,13.01 and 19.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Lawyer's Oath and is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for two (2) years.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case largely relies on the testimony of the Judge and Sheriff Nabua. A challenge to their credibility could weaken the case.
*   **Proof of Intent:** Establishing a *mens rea* for bribery and influence peddling can be challenging, as intent can be difficult to prove directly. However, the circumstantial evidence (name-dropping, fee-sharing offer, threats) appears strong.

**Statutory References:**

*   Code of Professional Responsibility (Canons 10, 11, 13, 19; Rules 10.01, 11.03, 13.01, 19.01)
*   Rules of Court, Section 9, Rule 39 (Implementation of a Writ of Execution)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Belleza v. Atty. Macasa* (Public Confidence)
*   *Velasco v. Atty. Doroin, et al.* (Disbarment as privilege)
*   *Ceniza v. Atty. Rubia* (Burden of Proof)
*   *Bildner, et al. v. Ilusorio, et al.* (Impropriety of ex-parte contact with judge)
*   *Jimenez, et al. v. Atty. Verano, Jr.* (Honest and Fair Means)
*   *Fajardo v. Atty. Alvarez* (Influence Peddling as unethical)
*    *Plumptre v. Atty. Rivera,*
*   *Rau Sheng Mao v. Atty. Velasco*
*   *Yuhico v. Gutierrez*
*   *Punla v. Atty. Villa-Ona*
*    *Sanchez v. Atty. Torres*
*   *Paras v. Paras*

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   While the facts presented by the complainant appear compelling, the lack of response from Atty. Camacho (deemed waiver of right to comment) might present some perceived procedural unfairness, although this is likely mitigated by the clear evidence presented.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the findings of fact but modified the penalty. As Atty. Camacho had already been disbarred, it was deemed appropriate to suspend him for 2 years solely for record keeping with the OBC. This penalty would be taken into account should Atty. Camacho apply to have his disbarment lifted.
