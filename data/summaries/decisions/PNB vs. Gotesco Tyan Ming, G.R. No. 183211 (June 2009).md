**Case Summary: *Philippine National Bank v. Gotesco Tyan Ming Development, Inc.* G.R. No. 183211 (2009)**

**Core Issue:** Propriety of consolidating an *ex-parte* Petition for Issuance of Writ of Possession (LRC Case No. R-6695-PSG) with an action for Annulment of Foreclosure, Specific Performance, and Damages (Civil Case No. 68139).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and Regional Trial Court (RTC), holding that consolidation was improper and prejudicial to PNB.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Credit & Foreclosure:** GOTESCO obtained an P800M credit facility from PNB, MBTC, UCPB, and CBC, secured by a Mortgage Trust Indenture. GOTESCO defaulted, leading to foreclosure and PNB purchasing the property at auction.
*   **Redemption Period:** GOTESCO failed to redeem the property within the statutory one-year period.
*   **Writ of Possession:** PNB filed an *ex-parte* petition for a writ of possession. GOTESCO moved to consolidate this with its action seeking to annul the foreclosure.
*   **RTC/CA Rulings:** Both the RTC and CA upheld the consolidation, relying on judicial economy and *Philippine Savings Bank v. Ma単alac, Jr.*
*   **SC Reversal:** The SC found that the consolidation delayed the writ of possession, prejudiced PNB's right to immediate possession, and gave GOTESCO an undue advantage.

**Obligations:**

*   **PNB:** Entitled to immediate possession of the property after the expiration of the redemption period and consolidation of title.
*   **GOTESCO:** Obligated to relinquish possession after the redemption period expired.

**Liabilities:**

*   The case doesn't directly establish liabilities, but GOTESCO faces potential liability for damages if the foreclosure annulment action fails.
*   PNB faced potential economic liability due to delayed possession & prolonged legal procedures.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Delay:** Consolidation significantly delayed PNB's ability to take possession.
*   **Undue Advantage:** GOTESCO was able to retain possession of the property despite its failure to redeem.
*   **Prejudice to Summary Proceeding:** Transforming a summary *ex-parte* proceeding into a protracted, litigious matter prejudiced PNB.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 31, Section 1, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Sets forth the grounds for consolidation.
*   ***Philippine Savings Bank v. Ma単alac, Jr.* G.R. No. 145441 (2005):**  The SC distinguishes this case, as in *Ma単alac*, consolidation promoted expeditious resolution, while in this case, it had the opposite effect. The present ruling clarifies that *Ma単alac* should not be interpreted to permit consolidation where it prejudices a party's rights.
*   ***Teston v. Development Bank of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 144374 (2005)**:  Cited for the proposition that consolidation should be denied when it would cause prejudice or restrict the rights of a party.
*   ***De Vera v. Agloro*, G.R. No. 155673 (2005)**:  Affirmed the denial of consolidation where the rights of a party would be prejudiced, highlighting the summary nature of a writ of possession proceeding.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention involves the applicability of the judicial economy argument in the context of an *ex-parte* writ of possession, further clarified by the SC with emphasis on the potential for abuse.

**Legally Precise Points for Analysis:**

*   The SC emphasized that the nature of a writ of possession proceeding as *ex-parte* and summary must be preserved.  A pending annulment action, in itself, does not preclude the issuance of the writ.  *Fernandez v. Espinoza* G.R. No. 156421 (2008).
*   The ruling underscores the purchaser's absolute right to possession upon the expiration of the redemption period.
*   The decision clarified that the discretion to consolidate is not unlimited and should not be exercised in a way that prejudices the rights of a party or defeats the purpose of the rules.
