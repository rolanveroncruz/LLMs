## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-06-2249 (Formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 05-2351-P)

**Case:** *Judge Placido C. Marquez and Atty. Lyn L. Llamasares vs. Lucila C. Pacariem*

**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division

**Date:** October 8, 2008

**Subject:** Administrative complaint against Lucila C. Pacariem, a court stenographer, for gross neglect of duty, gross inefficiency, gross insubordination, and gross misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Transcription Delays (Admin. Circular No. 24-90, Rule 136 Sec. 17):** Failure to submit transcripts of stenographic notes (TSN) within 20 days. Failure to immediately submit stenographic notes at the close of court sessions.
*   **Inaccurate Work:** Numerous grammatical and typographical errors in typewritten work, requiring multiple revisions. (Supported by 254 pages of evidence).
*   **Misleading Certifications:** Allegedly misleading Atty. Llamasares into signing certifications stating no pending TSNs.
*   **Leave Violations (CSC Memorandum Circular No.41):** Delayed filing of sick and special leave applications.
*   **Loafing & Dishonesty:** Excessive time spent outside the office during work hours, discrepancies in logbook entries, falsified attendance records (SC Logbook discrepancies).

**OCA Findings & Recommendations:**

*   Guilty of inefficiency, loafing, and inaccuracies in logbook entries.
*   Recommended a one-year suspension without pay.
*   Dismissed other charges for lack of merit.

**Court's Decision:**

*   **Guilty:** Upheld the OCA's findings on inefficiency, loafing, and false entries.
*   **Penalty:** One-year suspension without pay.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Consistent "Unsatisfactory" performance ratings (2004) justified the charges.
    *   Failure to meet the 20-day TSN submission requirement constitutes gross neglect (cited *Judge Francisco Ibay v. Virginia Lim, A.M. No. P-99-1309* & *Judge Felipe Banzon v. Ruby Hechanova, A.M. No. P-04-1765*).
    *   Inaccurate logbook entries reflect dishonesty and failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC).

**Liabilities:**

*   Suspension from service without pay for one year.
*   Future similar acts will warrant a more severe penalty.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of Performance Ratings:** While the court upheld the validity of the "Unsatisfactory" ratings, performance evaluations can be subjective and potentially influenced by personal bias.
*   **Mitigation of Penalty:** While the court acknowledged the possibility of dismissal based on consecutive "Unsatisfactory" ratings (citing *Re: Dropping for the Roll of Ms. Lolita B. Batadlan, Court Stenographer III, Regional Trial Court of Surallah, South Cotabato , Branch 26, A.M. No. 06-2-125-RTC*), it opted for a lesser penalty, citing humanitarian reasons and respondent's prior positive performance evaluations.
*   **Double Jeopardy Concerns:** The respondent already had an administrative case previously filed and this could be seen as an additional administrative action for the same acts which is not allowed.
*   **Logbook Inaccuracies:** The court seemed to have focused too much on the logbook entries.
*   **Lack of Proper Procedure:** There was a lack of proper procedure followed.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** 20-day deadline for TSN submission.
*   **Rule 136, Section 17, Rules of Court:** Stenographer's duty to submit notes to the clerk of court.
*   **Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 41 (Series of 1998):** Regulations on sick leave and special leave privileges (Sections 21, 53, and 54).
*   **OCA Circular No. 37-2002:** Dropping from the rolls for consecutive "Unsatisfactory" ratings.
*   **Executive Order No. 292, Section 5, Rule IX, Book V:** Grievance procedure for performance ratings.
*   **Section 22, Rule XIV, Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** Definition of "loafing."
*   **A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC (Code of Conduct for Court Personnel):** Commitment to official duties during working hours.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Judge Francisco Ibay v. Virginia Lim, A.M. No. P-99-1309*: Failure to submit TSNs within prescribed period is gross neglect.
*   *Judge Felipe Banzon v. Ruby Hechanova, A.M. No. P-04-1765*:  Same holding as *Ibay v. Lim*.
*   *Re: Dropping for the Roll of Ms. Lolita B. Batadlan, Court Stenographer III, Regional Trial Court of Surallah, South Cotabato , Branch 26, A.M. No. 06-2-125-RTC*:  Dismissal for two consecutive "Unsatisfactory" ratings.
*   *Re: Habitual Absenteeism of Mr. Fernando P. Pascual, A.M. No.2005-16-SC*: Humanitarian considerations in penalty imposition.
