## Legal Document Summary: Sia Tio v. Abayata (G.R. No. 160898)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Decision affirming RTC Decision that annulled a mortgage, mortgage sale, subsequent sale, and certificates of title, and declared Respondents the absolute owners of the disputed property.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioners are innocent purchasers for value and in good faith.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, reversing the CA and RTC decisions, and **DISMISSED** Civil Case No. 2230-L. Petitioners' counterclaim and cross-claim were denied.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Equitable Mortgage (Civil Case No. 620-L):** The initial sale between Lasola (mortgagee) and Celedonio Abayata (mortgagor, Respondents' predecessor-in-interest) was deemed an equitable mortgage. Respondents failed to prove redemption within the 30-day period stipulated by the court.
*   **Transfer of Title to Lasola and Subsequent Mortgage:** Lasola obtained TCT No. 11428 and mortgaged the property to the Rural Bank. The Rural Bank foreclosed and sold the property to Petitioners, who obtained TCT No. 20006.
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value:** The Court ruled that the Petitioners were good faith purchasers, despite Rural Bank's mortgage being deemed in bad faith.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   The CA and RTC wrongly held the petitioners liable.
*   Moral and exemplary damages were not awarded to the petitioners.
*   Attorney's fees and litigation expenses were also denied.
*   The Court denied petitioners' claim for damages against respondents since it has not been shown that the filing of the complaint before the RTC was imbued with bad faith.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Section 4(a), Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Requires impleading adverse parties in petitions for review.
*   **Article 2234, Civil Code:** Specifies the requirements for awarding exemplary damages.
*   **Torrens System Principles:** Emphasized the importance of relying on the correctness of certificates of title.
*   **PD 1529, Section 78:** Registration requirements, particularly annotation of lis pendens.
*   **Art. 1391 Civil Code and/or laches:**
Prescription and delays.

**Case Law:**

*   Referenced multiple cases regarding the definition of "purchaser in good faith," including *Cruz v. Court of Appeals* and *Chua v. Soriano*.
*   Citations regarding due diligence expected of banking institutions as mortgagees, including *Bank of Commerce v. San Pablo, Jr.*
*   Citations on lis pendens (*Heirs of Eugenio Lopez, Sr. v. Enriquez*).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Omission of Parties:** The failure to implead Lasola and the Rural Bank initially presented a jurisdictional issue but was ultimately disregarded due to their participation in the proceedings.
*   **Rural Bank's Bad Faith:** While the Rural Bank was deemed a mortgagee in bad faith, this did not automatically negate the petitioners' status as good faith purchasers. This aspect presented a contentious point on the derivative nature of the petitioners' title. The court found that the transfer was acceptable because petitioners did exercise due dilligence.
*   **Laches:** The Court emphasized the Respondents' failure to annotate a notice of lis pendens or the RTC decision in Civil Case No. 620-L on Lasola's title, leading to the application of laches.
*   **Valuation Discrepancy:** The discrepancy between the purchase price and the zonal valuation was addressed but could have been a point of contention if not for other factors supporting the reasonableness of the price.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court favored the Petitioners based on their status as good faith purchasers, the Respondents' failure to redeem the property in the earlier equitable mortgage case, and the Respondents' delay in protecting their interests by failing to record relevant notices. The decision underscores the reliance on the Torrens system and the importance of diligence in protecting real property rights.
