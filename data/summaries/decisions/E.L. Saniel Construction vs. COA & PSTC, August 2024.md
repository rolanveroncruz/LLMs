Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the *E.L. Saniel Construction v. Commission on Audit and PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation (PSTC)* case, focusing on key elements for a lawyer:

**Case:** *E.L. Saniel Construction v. Commission on Audit and PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation (PSTC)*, G.R. No. 260013, August 13, 2024.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 assailing COA Decision No. 2016-397, Resolution No. 2020-294, and Notice of Finality of Decision No. 2021-072.

**Facts:**

*   E.L. Saniel (Petitioner) contracted with PSTC (Respondent) for rehabilitation and riprap projects.  Petitioner claims additional works were necessary, resulting in unpaid billings of PHP 2,962,942.39 + interest and fees, due to unforeseen terrain conditions. PSTC was dissolved, and the PSTC Disposal Committee directed creditors to file money claims with COA.  COA denied the claim, stating the disposition of assets and obligations rests with the Disposal Committee, that the claims appeared to be booked trade payables (which did not require COA approval), and that the claims were in violation of Annex "E" of IRR-A of Republic Act No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act).
*   PSTC only certified PHP 26,928.88 as an outstanding liability.
*   COA denied Petitioner's money claim and motion for reconsideration due to late filing (procedural issue), and on the merits, citing failure to comply with notice requirements for Variation Orders under RA 9184 IRR-A, Annex "E", because the request for additional work was filed 5 months after the completion of the Riprap Project.

**Issues:**

1.  **Timeliness of Petition:** Was the petition for certiorari filed within the reglementary period under Rule 64, Section 3 of the Rules of Court?  COA argues it was filed late based on when Petitioner's counsel received the Resolution.  Petitioner claims it was timely based on when they *actually* received the Resolution.
2.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Did COA commit grave abuse of discretion in denying E.L. Saniel's money claims? This hinges on whether COA's denial was based on an incorrect interpretation or application of the law, specifically concerning Variation Orders and *quantum meruit*.

**Holding:** Petition denied. COA's Decision, Resolution, and Notice of Finality are affirmed.

**Rationale:**

1.  **Timeliness:** The Court held that the Petition was filed late.  Notice to counsel (Atty. Tabao) is notice to the litigant.  COA Resolution was received by Atty. Tabao on September 8, 2020, leaving only five days to file the petition for certiorari. The petition was filed on September 20, 2021, which was beyond the deadline. Therefore, the COA decision had already become final and executory.
2.  **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The COA's denial was not an abuse of discretion. E.L. Saniel failed to comply with the mandatory notice and approval requirements for Variation Orders under Annex "E" of RA 9184 IRR-A.  The additional work lacked prior approval.

    *   **Variation Orders:** Claims must not exceed 20% of the original contract price, notice is required within 7 days of commencing additional works, or 28 days of the justification for the extra cost occuring (failure to timely notify is a waiver).
    *   **Quantum Meruit:** The principle of *quantum meruit* (payment for the reasonable value of services rendered) is not applicable here because there was no implied authorization by PSTC to perform the additional work. The Court distinguished this case from others where *quantum meruit* was applied, noting that in those cases, there was some form of express or implied authorization by the procuring entity.  E.L. Saniel unilaterally decided to proceed with the additional works without notifying PSTC. The court also cited IRR-A Section 17.7 which states that the bidder is deemed to have already inspected the project site and assessed for any possible issues.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and its IRR-A, Annex "E":**  Governs procurement activities and requirements for government contracts, including Variation Orders, notice, and approval.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 64, Section 3:** Sets the reglementary period (30 days) for filing petitions for certiorari from COA decisions.
*   **Contractual Obligations:**  E.L. Saniel was obligated to inspect the site, assess risks, and comply with procurement regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   E.L. Saniel bears the financial loss for the unapproved additional works.  Cannot recover based on *quantum meruit*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Strict Compliance with Procurement Rules:**  This case reinforces the need for contractors working with government entities to strictly adhere to procurement laws and regulations, particularly regarding Variation Orders and securing prior approval for additional works.
*   **Timeliness of Legal Actions:** Failure to comply with procedural rules regarding deadlines can be fatal to a case, regardless of the merits.
*   **Unilateral Actions:**  Contractors proceed with additional work at their own risk if they do so without proper authorization, even if the work benefits the government.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and IRR-A, Annex "E"
*   Rules of Court, Rule 64, Section 3
*   *Royal Trust Construction v. Commission on Audit* (distinguished)
*   *F.L. Hong Architects and Associates v. Armed Forces of the Philippines* (distinguished)
*   *EPG Construction Co. v. Hon. Vigilar* (distinguished)
*   *Movertrade Corp. v. Commission on Audit*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether the additional works were truly "unforeseen" and the extent to which E.L. Saniel should have anticipated them during its initial site inspection.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   This case emphasizes the importance of detailed documentation and compliance with procurement procedures for government contracts. It also highlights the difficulty in recovering for extra work without prior approval, even if the work benefits the government.  Future claims would need to demonstrate express or implied authorization, along with compelling circumstances to overcome the procedural defects.

This summary should provide a solid foundation for a lawyer reviewing this case.
