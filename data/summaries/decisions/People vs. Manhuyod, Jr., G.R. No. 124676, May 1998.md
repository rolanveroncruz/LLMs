## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Manhuyod, Jr.* (G.R. No. 124676, May 20, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court decision convicting the accused, Restituto Manhuyod, Jr., of rape with the aggravating circumstance of relationship, sentencing him to death.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** The accused was charged with rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. 7659) for allegedly raping his 17-year-old daughter. The information, however, failed to specifically reference the amendatory law (R.A. 7659) in full detail.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the sworn statements of the victim (Relanne) and her mother (Yolanda), along with the testimony of NBI agents (Atty. Tomarong and Atty. Icao, Jr.) and a medico-legal officer (Dr. Refe). The victim and her mother later executed an Affidavit of Desistance and failed to appear at trial, rendering their sworn statements the core of the prosecution's evidence.
*   **Hearsay:** The core issue revolves around the admissibility of the sworn statements. The defense argued these were inadmissible hearsay. The trial court admitted them as exceptions to the hearsay rule, specifically as part of the *res gestae*.
*   **Res Gestae Analysis:** The Supreme Court thoroughly analyzes the requirements for *res gestae* under Section 42, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, citing *People v. Sanchez* and *People v. Ner*. It finds that the statements, made 36 days after the alleged incident, lacked spontaneity, were made after deliberation, and had intervening events, thus failing to qualify as part of the *res gestae*. The mother's statement was considered double hearsay.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The Court correctly upheld the denial of the motion to dismiss based on the affidavit of desistance, citing established jurisprudence that such affidavits filed *after* the institution of criminal action cannot serve as grounds for dismissal.
*   **Penalty:** The trial court erroneously based the death penalty on the *alternative* aggravating circumstance of relationship under Article 15 of the RPC, instead of the *special* aggravating circumstance of relationship provided under Article 335 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 7659. The court notes that R.A. 7659 treats the father-daughter relationship in rape cases as a special circumstance warranting the death penalty. Had this been applied correctly, it would have been considered as a special circumstance making the imposition of the death penalty mandatory.
*   **Information Defects:** The Supreme Court points out the negligence of the Provincial Prosecutor in failing to properly allege the offense in the information, particularly regarding the reference to R.A. 7659.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the trial court's decision and acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The most significant risk was the reliance on hearsay evidence, which ultimately led to the acquittal.
*   The error in determining the proper penalty.
*   The failure to reference R.A. No. 7659 when filing the information.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 15, 335, 336, 344
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amendment to Article 335, imposing death penalty for certain heinous crimes, including rape with specified aggravating circumstances.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 130, Sections 36 and 42 (hearsay and *res gestae*); Rule 132, Section 1 (examination of witnesses); Rule 133, Section 2 (proof beyond reasonable doubt).
*   **Relevant Cases:** *People v. Sanchez*, *People v. Ner*, *People v. Entes*, *People v. Miranda*, *People v. Soliao*, *Bayani M. Alonte v. Hon. Maximo A. Savellano, Jr.*, *Pantranco North Express, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, *People v. Simon*, *People v. Taneo*, *Anciro v. People*.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the importance of adhering to evidentiary rules, particularly concerning hearsay, and the need for prosecutors to meticulously prepare informations, accurately citing relevant statutes and amendments. It reaffirms the constitutional presumption of innocence and the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
