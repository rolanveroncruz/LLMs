## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Teofilo Gabatan vs. Court of Appeals and Lourdes Evero Pacana* (G.R. No. 150206, March 13, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's decision in a case for Recovery of Property and Ownership and Possession.

**Subject Matter:** 1.1062 hectare parcel of land (Lot 3095 C-5) originally owned by Juan Gabatan. The core dispute is whether respondent Lourdes Evero Pacana is the sole heir of Juan Gabatan.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Respondent's Claim:** Lourdes Evero Pacana (Respondent) claims ownership as the sole heir of Juan Gabatan, through her mother Hermogena Gabatan Evero, alleging Hermogena was the sole child of Juan Gabatan. She contends the land was entrusted to Teofilo Gabatan (Petitioners' predecessor) for administration, who failed to return it.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** The Heirs of Teofilo Gabatan (Petitioners) deny Hermogena's filiation to Juan Gabatan, claiming Juan died single and without issue, survived by his siblings Teofilo, Macaria and Justa, who inherited the land. They assert ownership through acquisitive prescription. They also raised a prior dismissed case (Civil Case No. 5840) and argue the action is barred by prescription and laches.
*   **RTC and CA Decisions:** Ruled in favor of Respondent, declaring her the owner and ordering reconveyance of OCT No. P-3316, moral damages, and attorney's fees. The CA affirmed, giving weight to the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exhibit H) identifying Hermogena as an heir of Juan Gabatan, a declaration supposedly against Teofilo's interest, and finding no acquisitive prescription.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the CA and RTC decisions.
*   **Dismissed** the complaint for lack of merit.

**Key Issues and Reasoning:**

1.  **Determination of Heirship:** The Court reiterates the general rule that determination of heirship must be made in a special proceeding, not an ordinary civil action for recovery of property. However, acknowledging *Portugal v. Portugal-Beltran*, the Court notes the circumstances allow for determination of heirship within the present civil case since the issue was presented to the trial court, the parties were able to present their respective evidence and only one parcel of land is at issue.
2.  **Proof of Filiation:** The Court finds Respondent failed to prove Hermogena's filiation to Juan Gabatan. Discrepancies in Respondent's birth certificates are highlighted, particularly concerning Hermogena's maiden name. The court finds that Exhibit A, submitted by respondent, was not reliable. Furthermore, the court found it was crucial for respondent to demonstrate the link between her mother and Juan Gabatan, a crucial factor that respondent's Exhibit A failed to address. 
3.  **Admissibility of Deed of Absolute Sale (Exhibit H):** The Court deems the photocopy of the Deed of Absolute Sale inadmissible due to violation of the best evidence rule. The original was not presented, its loss not adequately explained, and the certification by the local assessor's officer was insufficient authentication since the assessor's office is not the proper repository of original notarized deeds of sale. The notary public is mandated by law to keep an original of the Deed of Absolute Sale in his notarial register and to forward the same to the proper court.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:**  Addresses Petitions for Review on Certiorari.

*   **Solivio v. Court of Appeals:** Reiterated Litam ruling.
*   **Milagros Joaquino v. Lourdes Reyes:** Further emphasized the need for a special proceeding to determine filiation and heirship.
*   **Agapay v. Palang:** The status of an illegitimate child who claimed to be an heir to a decedent's estate could not be adjudicated in an ordinary civil action which, as in this case, was for the recovery of property.
*   **Portugal v. Portugal-Beltran:** Exception to the rule requiring a special proceeding for heirship determination where only one property is involved.
*   **Department of Education Culture and Sports v. Del Rosario:** A party must first satisfactorily explain the loss of the best or primary evidence before he can resort to secondary evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The trial court's reliance on Exhibit A despite finding it suspicious.
*   The interpretation of the Deed of Absolute Sale (Exhibit H) as a declaration against interest.
*   The conflicting testimonies regarding the filiation of Hermogena to Juan Gabatan.
*   The exception to the requirement of a special proceeding given that the parties are blood relatives of the petitioner's husband and cannot be said to be impartial.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   The decision may be detrimental to individuals relying on the earlier RTC and CA rulings.
*   The case highlights the importance of proper authentication of documents and adhering to the best evidence rule.
*   Future cases should establish clear evidence of filiation in inheritance disputes.
*   Potential for future litigation if other properties of the estate are discovered or if the current ruling is challenged.
*   The relaxed application of the rule requiring special proceedings could lead to inconsistent results in similar cases.
