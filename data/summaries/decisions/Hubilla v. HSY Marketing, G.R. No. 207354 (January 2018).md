**Case Summary: Hubilla et al. v. HSY Marketing et al., G.R. No. 207354, January 10, 2018**

**Nature of the Document:**  Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari, assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Central Issue:** Whether petitioners were illegally dismissed by respondents.
*   **Factual Background:** Employees (petitioners) aired grievances on a radio program concerning alleged labor violations. Subsequently, they claimed they were barred from their workplaces and constructively dismissed.  Employers (respondents) claimed the employees voluntarily resigned and were asked to explain their absences.
*   **Conflicting Lower Court Decisions:** The Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaints, finding voluntary resignation. The NLRC reversed, ruling illegal dismissal based on the principle of equipoise (doubt resolved in favor of the employee). The CA reversed the NLRC, reinstating the LA decision, arguing the employees failed to present evidence of dismissal.
*   **Verification and Certification of Non-Forum Shopping:** The Court deemed Respondents counsel's verification invalid because it was based on information relayed by clients instead of personal knowledge or authentic records. The certification of non-forum shopping was deemed defective because it was signed by the counsel of record.
*   **Equipoise Rule:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that the evidence was in equipoise, meaning both parties' claims were unsubstantiated.  It reiterated that in such cases, doubt is resolved in favor of the employee (Article 4 of the Labor Code).
*   **Abandonment:** SC rules that there was no evidence of intent to abandon their employment, mere absence is not sufficient for abandonment.
*   **Reinstatement/Separation Pay:**  SC reversed the CA decision and ordered the employees to be reinstated without loss of seniority rights or other privileges. If reinstatement is impossible, separation pay is awarded.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:**  To prove just cause and due process in termination cases (Art. 294 [279] Labor Code). Burden of proof is on the employer to prove just cause.
*   **Employer's Liability:**  For illegal dismissal, including reinstatement or separation pay, backwages.
*   **Employee's Obligation:** Though not specifically outlined, the decision highlights the right of employees to air grievances and the state's policy to afford protection to labor per Art. II, Sec. 18 of the Constitution.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Evidence:** The core issue stemmed from conflicting accounts and insufficient documentation, leading to the application of the equipoise rule.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence for Illegal Dismissal:**  The Court implies that while the dismissal itself was questionable and potentially retaliatory, the petitioners needed to provide substantial proof of the termination to render the claim as valid.
*   **Strained Relations Doctrine:** While the SC ordered reinstatement, the potential for "strained relations" could lead to the substitution of reinstatement with separation pay, which could require further litigation.
*   **Lack of Receipt of Notices:** A key issue was the lack of proof that the employees received notices of termination. This highlights the importance of proper documentation and service procedures.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Shipside Incorporation v. Court of Appeals:** Re: requirements for proper verification of pleadings.
*   **Altres v. Empleo:** Outlines the rules on compliance with verification and certification against forum shopping.
*   **Philippine Blooming Mills Employment Organization v. Philippine Blooming Mills Co.:** Re: prioritization of human rights over property rights in labor disputes.
*   **Samarca v. Arc-Men Industries:** Re: abandonment as matter of intent.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Art. 4 (Interpretation in favor of labor), Art. 294 [279] (Reinstatement and Backwages), Art. 297 [282] (Termination by Employer).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 7 Section 4 (Verification) and Rule 65 Section 1.

**Recommendations:**

*   Employers should ensure proper documentation of employee discipline and termination, including proof of service of notices.
*   Employers should understand that retaliatory actions against employees who exercise their right to free expression can be considered illegal dismissal.
*   Litigants (especially counsel) must comply strictly with the Rules of Court regarding verification and certification of non-forum shopping.
