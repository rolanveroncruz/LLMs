**Case Summary: *Jose A. Linzag vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 122181, June 26, 1998***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing a petition for annulment of judgment of a cadastral court. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision.

**Key Issue:** Whether res judicata bars a petition to annul the judgment of a cadastral court after an unfavorable judgment in a prior action for annulment of the original certificate of title and subsequent appeals to the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held in the affirmative, finding the Court of Appeals did not err and there was no grave abuse of discretion in its decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Res Judicata (Section 47(b), Rule 39, Rules of Court):** The court emphasizes the doctrine of res judicata as barring relitigation of issues. The Court held that all four requisites of Res Judicata are present.

**Statutory References and Case Law:**

*   **Section 47(b), Rule 39, Rules of Court:** Codifies the doctrine of res judicata.
*   **B.P. Blg. 129, Section 9(2):** Grants the Court of Appeals original jurisdiction over actions to annul RTC judgments.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Pertains to appeals by petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Pertains to special civil actions for certiorari and mandamus.
*   **De Ramos v. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 207, 214 [1992]; Baguioro v. Basa, 214 SCRA 437, 444 [1992]:** Res Judicata
*   **Filinvest Credit Corp. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 207 SCRA 59, 63 [1992]:** Aspect of res judicata

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Dismissal of Petition:** The SC dismissed the petition.
*   **Costs Against Petitioners:** The SC assessed costs against the petitioners.
*   **Abuse of Rules of Procedure:** The Court criticized parties who vary the form of action to avoid res judicata, deeming it an abuse of procedural rules.
*   **Failure to timely avail remedies:** Remedy of annulment of judgment under Section 9(2) of B.P. Blg. 129 was no longer available to petitioners because the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies were no longer available through no fault of petitioners.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The petitioners argued fraud in the cadastral proceedings and that the withdrawal of their claim was procured through fraud. However, these issues were deemed to have already been raised and passed upon by the trial court in the annulment case (Civil Case 571).

**Analysis and Potential Issues:**

*   The Court heavily relied on res judicata to bar the petition. A key point of contention was whether the action to annul the cadastral court's judgment was, in substance, the same as the prior action for annulment of title, which was already decided. The court found that the "underlying objective or relief sought" was essentially the same.
*   The Court raised the improper choice of remedy (Rule 65 instead of Rule 45) as another ground for dismissal. This highlights the importance of selecting the correct procedural vehicle for judicial review.
*   The Court noted that the petitioners might have resorted to the filing of Civil Case No. 571 because they had lost the right to file a petition for review. A party deprived of his property in a cadastral proceeding may file within one (1) year from entry of the decree, a petition for review. After the lapse of said period, if the property has not yet passed on to an innocent purchaser for value, an action for reconveyance may still be filed by the aggrieved party.
