**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Nelson Arraz, G.R. No. 183696, October 24, 2008 (591 Phil. 128)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Nelson Arraz for qualified rape under Article 266-A (1)(a) in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. Arraz was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping his 14-year-old niece (AAA).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Qualified Rape. Defined under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, and qualified by the victim being under 18 years old and the offender being a relative within the third civil degree (Article 266-B).
*   **Evidence:** The conviction was based primarily on the positive and credible testimony of the victim (AAA). Medico-legal evidence (old healed hymenal laceration) corroborated the victim's account. The Court gave great weight to the trial court's factual findings.
*   **Defense:** The defendant denied the charges, claiming he only attempted to kiss the victim. His denial was deemed insufficient to overcome the victim's positive testimony.
*   **Date Discrepancy:** The Court disregarded the discrepancy in the date of the offense, citing Section 11 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure. The Court considered the date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime.
*   **Lack of Outcry:** The victim's failure to shout or make an outcry did not diminish her credibility, given her age and the offender's familial relationship and potential moral ascendancy, citing People v. Alberio.
*   **Impossibility:**  The defense argued that the rape was impossible due to other occupants in the house. The Court rejected this argument by citing People v. Talaboc, stating that the Court has found that venues of rape have been inside a house where there were other occupants
*   **Behavioral Response:**  The Court recognized that there is no standard reaction to being raped, and the victim's reporting the incident to someone she believed to be a member of the NPA was acceptable, citing People v. Talaboc.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Sentence:** Reclusion Perpetua (without eligibility for parole, pursuant to RA 9346).
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Civil indemnity (P75,000), moral damages (P75,000), and exemplary damages (P25,000) were awarded to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:**  The entire case hinges on the credibility of the victim's testimony.
*   **No Parole:** Reclusion Perpetua without eligibility for parole leaves the defendant no recourse for release based on good behavior.

*   **People v. Cabalquinto (G.R. No. 167693, 19 September 2006, 502 SCRA 419)**: Withholding names of victims and immediate family members in cases under RA 9262.

*   **People v. Alberio (G.R. No. 152584, 6 July 2004, 433 SCRA 469, 475)**: Failure to shout or offer tenacious resistance did not make voluntary submission to appellant's lust.
