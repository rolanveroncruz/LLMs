**Case Summary: *M+W Zander Philippines, Inc. vs. Trinidad M. Enriquez*, G.R. No. 169173, June 5, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, contesting the CA's decision finding illegal dismissal of Respondent Enriquez.

**Key Issue:** Was Enriquez illegally dismissed based on willful breach of trust?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision finding the dismissal illegal, but removed the personal liability from the General Manager.

**Facts:**

*   Enriquez was employed by M+W Zander as Administration Manager and Executive Assistant.
*   Following the appointment of a new General Manager (Wiltschek), a "Letter of Appeal" signed by 29 employees, including Enriquez, was sent expressing discontent.
*   M+W Zander alleged Enriquez actively solicited signatures and instigated a "no work day" after the letter's release, citing affidavits from some employees.
*   Enriquez was issued a Notice to Explain, preventively suspended, and subsequently terminated for "willful breach of trust."
*   Labor Arbiter found illegal dismissal; NLRC reversed; Court of Appeals reversed NLRC and found illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article 282(c) of the Labor Code:**  Employer may terminate employment for fraud or willful breach of trust.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:**  Enriquez breached trust by using her authority to influence subordinates to stage a work stoppage, disrupting company operations.
*   **Respondent's Argument:**  The dismissal was based on mere speculation.
*   **Supreme Court's Analysis of "Loss of Trust and Confidence":**
    *   Employee must hold a position of trust (managerial or fiduciary). Court found position to be Managerial.
    *   Must be an act justifying loss of trust, based on "willful breach of trust" and "clearly established facts."
    *   Breach must be dishonest, deceitful, or fraudulent.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   The court found no dishonesty or deceitful act by Enriquez, and her actions did not warrant the severe penalty of dismissal.
*   *General Bank and Trust Company v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. L-42724, April 9, 1985, 135 SCRA 569.: emphasized that Loss of confidence should not be simulated, but should be genuine, not a mere afterthought to justify earlier action taken in bad faith
*   Reliance on a single subordinate's statement (Mosende) was insufficient, especially given contrary evidence and the fact that another employee, Rivera, admitted to instigating the work stoppage but was not disciplined.
*   Singling out Enriquez for dismissal, while other employees who signed the letter or participated in the work stoppage were not disciplined, showed arbitrariness.
*   The penalty was disproportionate.
*   The manner of termination (preventive suspension, inspection of belongings, being escorted off premises, barring her from the premises unless escorted) was considered oppressive and caused undue humiliation, justifying moral damages.
*   Attorney's fees were justified as Enriquez was compelled to litigate due to the unjustified dismissal.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282(c):**  Grounds for termination by employer (willful breach of trust).
*   **Labor Code, Article 82:** Defines Managerial employees

**Case Law:**

*   *General Bank and Trust Company v. Court of Appeals* G.R. No. L-42724, April 9, 1985, 135 SCRA 569. (Loss of confidence should not be simulated and must be genuine, not a mere afterthought to justify earlier action taken in bad faith)
*   *Balayan Colleges v. National Labor Relations Commission* 325 Phil. 245 (1996). (Award of moral damages if manner of termination was done in a humiliating and insulting manner)
*   *Chiang Kai Shek School v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 58028, April 18, 1989, 172 SCRA 389. (Award of moral damages if told that she was dismissed, flatly, and without warning or a formal notice)
*   *EPG Construction Company, Inc., et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.*, G.R. No. 103372, June 22, 1992, 210 SCRA 235-236. (The general manager of a corporation should not be made personally answerable for the payment of an illegally dismissed employee's monetary claims arising from the dismissal unless he had acted maliciously or in bad faith in terminating the services of the employee)

**Liabilities and Remedies:**

*   M+W Zander was held liable for illegal dismissal.
*   Enriquez was entitled to:
    *   Reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and privileges.
    *   Full backwages, allowances, and other benefits from the time of withholding compensation.
    *   Moral damages (PHP 25,000).
    *   Attorney's fees.
    *   If reinstatement is not possible, separation pay equivalent to one month salary for every year of service.
*   Wiltschek (General Manager) was *not* held personally liable as there was no evidence of malice or bad faith.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Willful Breach of Trust" Interpretation:**  The ambiguity in defining what constitutes a "willful breach of trust" that justifies dismissal can be a point of contention in similar cases.  The burden of proof lies heavily on the employer to demonstrate the employee's dishonest or fraudulent conduct.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The case highlights the risk of relying heavily on circumstantial evidence and the importance of concrete proof when alleging misconduct leading to dismissal.  Conflicting testimonies and the existence of alternative explanations weaken the employer's position.
*   **Disparate Treatment:**  The disparate treatment of employees involved in the same actions raised concerns about fairness and potential discrimination, which ultimately undermined the employer's case.
*   **"Strained Relations":**  The potential issue of "strained relations" between Enriquez and M+W Zander could prevent actual reinstatement, leading to a separation pay settlement. However, the separation pay is computed until finality of the decision, meaning a significant monetary outlay for M+W Zander.

**Conclusion:** This case underscores the importance of due process, fair treatment, and substantial evidence when terminating an employee for "loss of trust and confidence," particularly in managerial roles. It also highlights the limited circumstances under which corporate officers can be held personally liable for corporate actions.
