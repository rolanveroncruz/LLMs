**Case Summary: People v. Pallarco, G.R. No. 119971, March 26, 1998 (351 Phil. 391)**

**Facts:**
*   Accused-Appellant Orlando Pallarco was convicted of murder by the RTC for the death of Jesus Jerusalem.
*   Eyewitness Apolonio Enomar Jr. testified that Pallarco shot Jerusalem at close range.
*   Defense: Alibi. Pallarco claimed he was drinking with friends elsewhere.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (Art. 248, par. 1, RPC). Defined as unlawful killing with treachery.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** Qualifying circumstance present. The attack was sudden, unexpected, and ensured execution without risk to the assailant. Victim was shot from behind while drinking with friends, giving him no opportunity to defend himself, meeting the definition of treachery under Art. 14, par. 16 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Reclusion Perpetua:** Sentence imposed by the trial court and affirmed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Civil Liability:** P50,000 death indemnity to the heirs of Jesus Jerusalem (consistent with prevailing jurisprudence per *People vs. Sol* and *People vs. Cayabyab*).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Pallarco is criminally liable for the murder of Jesus Jerusalem.
*   **Civil Liability:** Pallarco is civilly liable for the death of Jesus Jerusalem.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** The defense challenged the credibility of Prosecution Witness Enomar, citing delayed reporting, alleged contradictions, and a prior altercation. These arguments were rejected based on the trial court's assessment of Enomar's demeanor and the lack of improper motive.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The defense of alibi was deemed weak because Pallarco failed to prove physical impossibility of being at the crime scene. His alibi witness, Roque, placed Pallarco only 100 meters away from the crime scene, undermining the defense.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The Information alleged evident premeditation and nighttime as aggravating circumstances. The Supreme Court rejected these, as the prosecution failed to present clear and convincing evidence to establish evident premeditation, or that nighttime was deliberately sought or facilitated the commission of the crime *People vs. Ronquillo*, and *People vs. Dayson*.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 248, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines murder.
*   **Art. 14, par. 16 of the RPC:** Defines treachery.
*   ***People vs. Castillo*:** Reiterates appellate courts' deference to trial courts on witness credibility.
*   ***People vs. Fabrigas, Jr.*:** Kerosene lamp provides sufficient illumination for identification of a malefactor
*   ***People vs. Alberca*:** Delay in reporting does not necessarily impair credibility if sufficiently explained.
*   ***People vs. Landicho*:** Judicial notice of witnesses reluctance to be involved in investigations
*   ***People vs. Anonuevo*:** Alibi must prove both presence elsewhere and physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene.
*   ***People vs. Sol* and *People vs. Cayabyab*:** Cited for current jurisprudence on death indemnity.
*   ***People vs. Ronquillo*, and *People vs. Dayson*:** Aggravating circumstance of nighttime cannot be presumed.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The testimony of Witness Diogenes Salazar was internally contradictory and deemed unreliable by the trial court. The SC agreed with the trial court that it's evaluation of his testimony was correct.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the positive identification by a credible eyewitness, the failure of the alibi defense, and the presence of treachery. The case highlights the difficulty in successfully arguing an alibi defense and the importance of the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
