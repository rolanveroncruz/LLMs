**Case Summary: Lutap v. People, G.R. No. 204061, February 05, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's conviction of the Petitioner for Attempted Rape.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Petitioner initially charged with Rape by Sexual Assault under Article 266-A paragraph 2 in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Factual Allegations:** Prosecution alleged the Petitioner inserted his finger into the vagina of the 6-year-old victim. Evidence presented demonstrated Petitioner touched the victim's vagina while she was wearing shorts and underwear.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Rape, based on the testimonies of the victim and her brother, which were found to be credible.
*   **CA Ruling:** Modified to Attempted Rape. The CA found no insertion, only touching, insufficient for consummated rape.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed CA's ruling and convicted Petitioner of *Acts of Lasciviousness* under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of R.A. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act). The Supreme Court held there was no proof of penetration to support a rape or attempted rape conviction, but the act of touching the child's vagina constituted a lewd act.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner found guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 of R.A. 7610.
*   **Sentence:** Indeterminate penalty of 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* (minimum) to 15 years, 6 months, and 20 days of *reclusion temporal* (maximum).
*   **Damages:** Ordered to pay the victim moral damages (PhP15,000.00), exemplary damages (PhP15,000.00), a fine (PhP15,000.00), and civil indemnity (PhP20,000.00), plus 6% interest *per annum* from finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of Intent:**  The determination of intent (specifically whether the touching indicated an intent to penetrate) is a key factor.  The court rejected the inference of attempted rape based on the act of touching.
*   **Variance Doctrine:** The application of the variance doctrine in criminal procedure (Section 4, Rule 120 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure) carries inherent risk. Conviction of Acts of Lasciviousness based on a charge of Rape depends on the specific elements alleged and proven.
*   **Application of R.A. 7610:** The reliance on Section 5 of R.A. 7610 significantly increased the penalty because the victim was under 12. The use of "influence" as an equivalent of "force" by the Court is a subject of possible challenge.
* **Legal Standing:** While the decision uses the victim's name using intials (AAA), this practice has been a cause of concerns among privacy advocates. The decision should have been reviewed with a sensitivity toward the real name of the victim, her personal circumstances and other information which tend to establish or compromise her identity, as well as those of her immediate family or household members.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A and 266-B, Revised Penal Code (Rape)**

*   **Section 4 and 5, Rule 120, Rules of Criminal Procedure (Variance Doctrine)**
*   **People v. Mendoza, 595 Phil. 1197, 1211 (2008):** Establishes that touching alone is not equivalent to rape.
*   **People v. Campuhan, 385 Phil. 912, 920-922 (2000):** Defines 'touching' and 'entering' in context of penile rape.
*   **Cruz v. People, 745 Phil. 54, 71-72 (2014):**  Explains the elements of attempted rape.
*   **People v. Bonaagua, 665 Phil. 750, 769 (2011):** Distinguishes Acts of Lasciviousness from Rape, emphasizing the penetration requirement.
*   **Quimvel v. People, G.R. No. 214497, April 18, 2017:**  Interprets coercion and influence under R.A. 7610.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and convicted Lutap of Acts of Lasciviousness, relying on the established facts of touching a minor's vagina, but rejecting the inference of attempted rape due to the absence of penetration. The sentencing was notably affected by the invocation of R.A. 7610 due to the victim's age.
