## Legal Document Summary: *Albano-Sales v. Sales*, G.R. No. 174803

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision)

**Core Issue:** Propriety of the Court of Appeals (CA) entertaining an appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order concerning the partition of conjugal property following a declaration of nullity of marriage based on Article 36 of the Family Code (mutual psychological incapacity).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RTC Decision (Declared void ab initio):**
    *   Marriage declared void ab initio based on mutual psychological incapacity (Art. 36, Family Code).
    *   Mandated liquidation, partition, and distribution of "common property" per Art. 147 of the Family Code, and compliance with Articles 50, 51, and 52 of the Family Code, where applicable.
    *   Shared expenses for child support.
*   **RTC Order (Regarding Partition):**
    *   Initially ordered reception of evidence regarding property claims (September 3, 2003 Order).
    *   Later, *without* a hearing, approved Marywin's proposed project of partition (November 28, 2003 Order) and ordered the Branch Clerk of Court to execute deeds of conveyance. This order was issued *in absence* of Reynolan and his counsel.
*   **CA Decision:**
    *   Set aside RTC Orders dated November 28, 2003 and April 12, 2004 (denying Reynolan's Motion for Reconsideration).
    *   Remanded the case to the RTC for a hearing per the September 3, 2003 Order (reception of evidence). Based on the violation of Reynolan's "Constitutional right to property."
*   **Supreme Court Decision:**
    *   **Affirmed** the CA decision. Ordered the case remanded to the RTC for the hearing on the division of properties.
    *   Upheld CA decision regarding the appealability of the order and the need for the reception of evidence before the partition of properties.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Reynolan's Claims:** Potentially liable for failing to properly account for rentals collected. Risks the court finding against him if he fails to prove misappropriation of property proceeds or unauthorized sales. The case highlights possible violations of Article 147 regarding disposition of shared properties.
*   **Marywin's Claims:** Faces the risk of having the proposed partition rejected if Reynolan successfully proves his claims regarding fraudulent sale and misappropriation of rentals. Her aggressive motion for execution before due process could be construed unfavorably.
*   **General Risks:** The ambiguity in the initial RTC decision regarding the precise nature and extent of "common property" created the contentious issues and protracted litigation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Grounds for nullity of marriage (psychological incapacity).
*   **Article 147, Family Code:** Governs property relations in void marriages (co-ownership regime).
*   **Articles 50-52, Family Code:** Governs liquidation of properties in annulment/nullity cases.
*   **Rule 41, Section 1, Rules of Court:**  Regarding appealability of final orders (and non-appealability of orders of execution).

**Case Law:**

*   **Mercado-Fehr v. Fehr, G.R. No. 152716, October 23, 2003, 414 SCRA 288, 295.** Cited by the Court for determining that the RTC order was a final order, and therefore appealable.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of specificity in the initial RTC decision regarding the identification of common properties needing partition.
*   The precise nature of the property relations between Marywin and Reynolan during their cohabitation. Reynolan claimed they did not live as husband and wife; thereby, their property relations should not be governed by the rules of co-ownership.

**Legal Precision & Notes:**

*   The case turns on the procedural issue of appealability of the RTC Order concerning property partition, not the annulment decree itself. The Supreme Court focused on the due process violation in bypassing the planned reception of evidence.
*   Crucial elements are proving the degree of participation of each party in property acquisition and evidence of fraud/misappropriation.
*   The case highlights the importance of a clear and comprehensive initial determination of marital properties to avoid protracted post-decree litigation. The reliance on Art. 147 implies the relationship may have resembled common-law marriage/co-ownership.
