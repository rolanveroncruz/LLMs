## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tumaob, Jr., Sarga, and Malicse*, G.R. No. 125690 (June 22, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting the accused-appellants of murder.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Wolver Tumaob, Jr., Honorato Sarga, and Policarpio Malicse for murder under the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Treachery:** The Court upheld the trial court's finding of treachery (Art. 14(16), RPC) as the method of attack ensured the victim (Roseller Tugade) had no opportunity to defend himself. The court held that Malicse pinned the victim's arms while Tumaob stabbed him, and Sarga struck him with a bottle.
*   **Self-Defense (Tumaob):** Tumaob's claim of self-defense was rejected. The court found that his wounds were inconsistent with defensive actions, and he failed to prove unlawful aggression by the victim (Art. 11, RPC), reasonable necessity of the means employed, and lack of sufficient provocation. The Court cited the principle that asserting self-defense requires the accused to prove its elements with clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Alibi (Sarga & Malicse):** The defense of alibi by Sarga and Malicse was rejected. They failed to demonstrate physical impossibility of being present at the crime scene and were positively identified. The Court cited the principle that unsubstantiated denials are insufficient.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The Court reiterated that the trial court's assessment of witness credibility is generally given high respect. The Court dismissed the argument that witnesses were biased due to their relationship to the victim, as no improper motive was shown. The Court cited *People vs. Morales, 241 SCRA 267 (1995); People vs. Gondora, 265 SCRA 408 (1996)*
*   **Award of Indemnity:** The award of P50,000 indemnity to the victim's heirs was affirmed.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** All three accused are held solidarily liable for the P50,000 indemnity.
*   **Criminal Liability:** All three accused are criminally liable for murder.

**Penalties:**

*   **Sarga & Malicse:** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment).
*   **Tumaob:** The Court amended Tumaob's sentence to an indeterminate penalty of *prision mayor* maximum as minimum to *reclusion temporal* maximum as maximum, due to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Determination:** The case heavily relies on the factual determination of the trial court, particularly regarding treachery.
*   **Application of Mitigating Circumstance:** The Court's application of voluntary surrender to Tumaob's case could be subject to scrutiny.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 11 (Self-Defense), 14(16) (Treachery).
*   **People vs. Compendio, Jr., 258 SCRA 254 (1996):** Treachery requires no opportunity for defense.
*   **People vs. Garcia, 258 SCRA 411 (1996):** Treachery must be deliberately adopted.
*   **People vs. Morales, 241 SCRA 267 (1995):** Credibility of Witnesses.
*   **People vs. Gondora, 265 SCRA 408 (1996):** Relationship to a party does not impair credibility
