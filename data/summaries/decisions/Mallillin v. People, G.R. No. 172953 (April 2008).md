## Legal Document Summary: *Junie Mallillin y Lopez v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 172953

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Petitioner for violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 (illegal possession of *shabu*).

**Key Issue:** Whether the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, particularly concerning the chain of custody of evidence.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA decision, acquitting the Petitioner on reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 11, Article II:** Defines the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs and specifies corresponding penalties based on quantity.
*   **Rule 126, Section 12, Rules of Court:** Mandates the immediate delivery of seized property and a true inventory to the issuing court.
*   **Section 21, Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165:** Outlines the post-seizure procedure for handling seized drugs, including physical inventory and photographing at the place of seizure.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The prosecution has the burden to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs, from seizure to presentation in court, to ensure the integrity and identity of the evidence.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction for Illegal Possession:** The original RTC and CA decisions would have resulted in imprisonment (12 years and 1 day to 20 years) and a fine (P300,000.00).
*   **Failure to Properly Establish Chain of Custody:** Can lead to acquittal due to reasonable doubt regarding the identity and integrity of the evidence.  Susceptibility to alteration, tampering, or contamination increases the required strictness.  *Graham v. State*, 255 N.E.2d 652 (analogous case concerning heroin).
*   **Irregularities in Search & Seizure:**  Deviations from established procedures, such as sending the suspect away during the search, can undermine the presumption of regularity and raise doubts about the validity of the evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Primary statutory basis for the charge.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 126, Section 12:** Requirements for search warrants and delivery of seized property.
*   **People v. Go, G.R. No. 144639:** Emphasizes the mandatory nature of delivering seized property to the court.
*   **People v. Del Castillo, G.R. No. 153254:** Highlights the need for court approval before retaining seized property.
*   **People v. Gesmundo, G.R. No. 89373:** Violating mandatory requirements will defeat the enactment's purpose.
*   **People v. Ambrosio, G.R. No. 135378:** States the presumption of innocence overrides that of the presumption of regularity in duty performance.
*   **Graham v. State, 255 N.E.2d 652:** Important precedent regarding chain of custody and the fungible nature of drug evidence.
*   **People v. Simbahon, G.R. No. 132371:** Highlights the role of dangerous drugs as the corpus delicti and the absolute need to properly present them.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 21 IRR of RA 9165 proviso:**  The "justifiable grounds" exception for non-compliance with post-seizure procedures is contentious, as the prosecution failed to provide acceptable justification for deviations in this case.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court held that presumption was wrongly applied as circumstances did not indicate regular duty performance.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The police officers' actions, particularly sending the petitioner on an errand during the search and inconsistencies in the testimonies, created reasonable doubt. This risked the integrity of the evidence and opened the door to claims of planting or tampering.
*   The prosecution's failure to present key witnesses (Gallinera and Garcia) to complete the chain of custody was a significant weakness.
*   The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to established procedures in drug cases to protect the rights of the accused and maintain the integrity of the justice system.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court held that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody and prove the guilt of the petitioner beyond a reasonable doubt due to irregularities in the search and seizure procedures, missing witness testimonies, and suspicious circumstances surrounding the discovery of the drugs. Therefore, the presumption of innocence prevailed and the petitioner was acquitted.
