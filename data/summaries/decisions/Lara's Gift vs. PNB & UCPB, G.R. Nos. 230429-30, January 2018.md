**Legal Document Summary: Lara's Gift and Decors, Inc. v. PNB General Insurers Co., Inc. and UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc. (G.R. Nos. 230429-30)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Amended Decision reversing its original decision and annulling the RTC Omnibus Orders.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Insurance Policies:** Petitioner (LGDI) insured its handicraft products, raw materials, and machinery against fire with Respondents (PNB Gen & UCPB). PNB Gen assumed 55% of the risk, UCPB the remaining 45%. The policy was an "open policy" and increased via endorsement.
*   **Fire Incident & Claim:** A fire occurred shortly before policy expiration, damaging insured properties. LGDI filed a claim.
*   **Adjusters & Denial:** Respondents engaged adjusters (Cunningham Lindsey, then Esteban) who deemed LGDI's documentation insufficient. The claim was denied citing:
    *   Violation of Policy Conditions Nos. 13 and 19 (unspecified).
    *   Misdeclaration/exclusion of laser machines.
    *   Lack of independent evidence to substantiate loss.
*   **Pre-Trial Order:** RTC directed pre-trial briefs with exhibits, and warned that evidence not identified during pre-trial would be excluded, unless good cause shown. Parties made reservations for additional exhibits.

**Contentious Clauses & Key Issues:**

*   **Admissibility of Questioned Documents (POs, Sales Invoices, DRs):**
    *   *Arguments:*  LGDI introduced these documents during the re-direct examination of Mr. Villafuerte. Respondents objected, arguing they were not presented or marked during pre-trial, violating the Judicial Affidavit Rule (JA Rule) and Guidelines on Pre-Trial (A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC).
    *   *RTC Ruling:* Overruled objections, citing reservations in Pre-Trial Order and interests of justice.
    *   *CA Ruling (Amended):* Erred in allowing the introduction of exhibits not presented during pre-trial, citing Sections 2 and 10 of the JA Rule. Also, deemed Mr. Villafuerte's testimony hearsay due to lack of personal knowledge.
    *   *Supreme Court Ruling:* The Court found that the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion. The JA Rule and the Guidelines on Pre-Trial do not totally proscribe the submission of additional evidence even after the trial had already commenced

*   **Admissibility of 2nd Supplemental Judicial Affidavit of Mrs. Villafuerte:**
    *   *Arguments:* Respondents sought to expunge the 2nd Supplemental Judicial Affidavit of Mrs. Villafuerte (filed *during* trial) and attached documents for non-compliance with the JA Rule (A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC) and Guidelines on Pre-Trial.
    *   *RTC Ruling:* Denied motions to expunge based on reservations for additional evidence in the Pre-Trial Order.
    *   *CA Ruling (Amended):* Erred in admitting the affidavit because the petitioner failed to submit the affidavits during pre-trial.
    *   *Supreme Court Ruling:* The Court is of the opinion that the 2nd Supplemental Judicial Affidavit was properly admitted in evidence by the trial court because both parties reserved the right to present additional evidence.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **LGDI:** Potential risk of claim denial if documentary evidence is ultimately deemed inadmissible.
*   **PNB Gen & UCPB:** Potential liability for the insured loss if LGDI's claim is ultimately upheld. The denial of the insurance claim could lead to further litigation related to bad faith.
*   The Court stresses that despite the decision, the litigants are strictly enjoined to adhere to the provisions of the JA Rule, and to be circumspect in the contents of court documents and pleadings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Judicial Affidavit Rule (JA Rule) - A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC:** Mandates submission of judicial affidavits and exhibits before pre-trial. Sections 2 and 10 are critical regarding timing and waiver.
*   **Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-Trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures (Guidelines on Pre-Trial) - A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC:** Outlines procedures for pre-trial, including pre-marking of exhibits and consequences of non-compliance.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Certiorari), Rules on Evidence (Rule 132, Sections 7, 19, 20, 34, and 35).
*   *Ng Meng Tam v. China Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 214054, August 5, 2015.*
*   *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Genuino, G.R. No. 208792, July 22, 2015.*

**Ambiguities & Contentious Points:**

*   "Policy Conditions Nos. 13 and 19" are vaguely referenced in the claim denial. Their specific content and relation to the case must be investigated.
*   The "reservations" for additional evidence in the Pre-Trial Order are ambiguous. Did they waive strict compliance with the JA Rule? The Supreme Court ultimately held that it did.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition. The Court of Appeals' Amended Decision in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 138321 and 138774 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, thus reinstating the Court of Appeals' December 21, 2015 Decision.
