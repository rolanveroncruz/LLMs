**Legal Document Summary: *Formantes v. Duncan Pharmaceuticals***

**Case:** *Formantes v. Duncan Pharmaceuticals, Phils., Inc.* (G.R. No. 170661, December 4, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's decision affirming the NLRC's resolutions regarding illegal suspension/constructive dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment & Termination:** Ramon Formantes, a medical representative and acting district manager, was terminated by Duncan Pharmaceuticals for insubordination (failure to report, submit reports, and provide explanations).
*   **Alleged Misconduct:** Termination stemmed from allegations of attempted sexual abuse against a subordinate, Cynthia Magat. Magat provided a sworn statement detailing the alleged abuse.
*   **Procedural Issues:**
    *   Formantes initially filed for illegal suspension/constructive dismissal *before* formal termination.
    *   Respondent then sent letters charging grave misconduct.
    *   LA initially found valid dismissal due to sexual abuse but imposed a penalty for lack of formal notice/investigation prior to the *constructive* dismissal.
    *   NLRC and CA affirmed, increasing penalty for procedural due process violation.
*   **Formantes' Claims:**
    *   Deprivation of due process due to incompetent counsel (non-lawyer).
    *   Constructive dismissal.
    *   Dismissal based on grounds not in termination notice.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (Duncan Pharmaceuticals):**
    *   Obligation to provide due process in termination (notice and hearing).  Liable for nominal damages for procedural due process violation, even if just cause for dismissal exists.
*   **Employee (Formantes):**
    *   Obligation to comply with employer's instructions (even if constructively dismissed).
    *   Obligation to present evidence to rebut charges.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Shifting Justification for Termination:** The initial termination notice cited insubordination; however, the LA and courts considered the alleged sexual abuse as a just cause. This raises concerns about fairness and adequate notice (see *Rubberworld (Phils.), Inc. v. NLRC*, G.R. No. 72779, March 21, 1990, 183 SCRA 421, 424).
*   **Constructive Dismissal vs. Subsequent Misconduct:** The Court found constructive dismissal *before* formal termination, but the LA and appellate courts upheld the dismissal based on pre-existing, but unstated, grounds. This requires careful analysis of timing and causation.
*   **Due Process Claim:** While the Court rejected the lack of due process claim due to representation by multiple lawyers, the initial representation by a non-lawyer could potentially be argued as prejudicial, especially if that representative presented evidence or arguments on the *sexual misconduct* charge (the basis for the ultimate decision).
* **Standard of Proof:**  The labor tribunals deemed the charge proven with only “substantial evidence,” a lower standard of proof than beyond reasonable doubt or preponderance of evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Governs employment termination and due process requirements.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 133, Section 5:** Defines "substantial evidence."
*   *Rubberworld (Phils.), Inc. v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 72779, March 21, 1990, 183 SCRA 421, 424): Just cause for termination exists and is established by substantial evidence in the course of the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, the fact that the employer failed, prior to such termination, to accord to the discharged employee the right of formal notice of the charge or charges against him and a right to ventilate his side with respect thereto, will not operate to eradicate said just cause so as to impose on the employer the obligation of reinstating the employee and otherwise granting him such other concomitant relief as is appropriate in the premises.
*   *Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (G.R. No. 168498, June 16, 2006, 491 SCRA 213, 218, citing Batongbakal v. Zafra, 448 SCRA 399, 410 (2005)): requirements of due process
* *Fernandez v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 349 Phil. 65, 88-89 (1998): requirements of due process are satisfied where the parties are given the opportunity to submit position papers.
*   *Villarama v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 106341, September 2, 1994, 236 SCRA 280, 289): Sexual harassment is a valid cause for separation from service.
*   *Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission* (485 Phil. 248 (2004)): Nominal damages are due for procedural due process violations.

**Ambiguities & Further Investigation:**

*   The precise nature and scope of the duties of Atty. Jannette B. Ines and Guererro and Turgano Law Office, as well as the participation of Arnold V. Guerrero Law Offices, requires investigation.
*   Investigate whether the company's internal rules, regulations, and handbook sufficiently outline conduct expected from employee.
*   Review the actual termination letter and compare the stated grounds with the evidence presented by Duncan Pharmaceuticals to justify the dismissal.
*   Analyze the evidence supporting the constructive dismissal claim and whether Formantes suffered actual damages as a result.
