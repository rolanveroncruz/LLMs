**Case Summary: *Jimmy Co v. Court of Appeals and Broadway Motor Sales Corporation***

**Citation:** 353 Phil. 305 (G.R. No. 124922, June 22, 1998)

**Facts:** Jimmy Co (Petitioner) entrusted his vehicle to Broadway Motor Sales Corporation (Respondent) for repair. After paying for the services, the vehicle was not returned on the agreed date due to a weak battery. Before the rescheduled delivery date, the vehicle was allegedly carnapped while being road-tested. Co sued for damages based on Respondent's negligence.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Service:** Respondent entered into a contract of service to repair Petitioner's vehicle, obligating it to return the vehicle in a fully serviced condition (Article 1165, New Civil Code).
*   **Obligation to Deliver:** Respondent had an obligation to deliver the vehicle on the agreed-upon date, and failure to do so constituted delay (*mora solvendi*).
*   **Duty of Care:** As bailee for compensation, Respondent owed a duty of reasonable care to protect the vehicle from loss or damage.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Liability for Delay:** Respondent was already in delay when the carnapping occurred, making them liable even for fortuitous events (Article 1165, New Civil Code).
*   **Presumption of Fault:** Article 1265 of the New Civil Code establishes a presumption that the loss of the vehicle while in Respondent's possession was due to its fault, which Respondent failed to overcome.
*   **Assumption of Risk:** The Court reasoned that the nature of the repair business requires the assumption of risk, including the risk of carnapping (Articles 1174 and 1262, New Civil Code).
*   **Negligence Per Se:** Failure to comply with DTI Ministry Order No. 32, requiring insurance coverage for customer's property, constitutes negligence *per se* (Cipriano v. CA, 263 SCRA 711).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fortuitous Event:** Respondent argued carnapping was a fortuitous event. The Court held that the Respondent has the burden of proving that the carnapping was not due to its fault or negligence (Lasam v. Smith, 45 Phil. 657; General Enterprises, Inc., v. Llianga Bay Logging Co., Inc., 120 Phil. 702; Tugade v. CA, 85 SCRA 226).
*   **Pre-Trial Agreement:** The Court of Appeals held the trial court was limited to resolving the issue of negligence as agreed during pre-trial. However, the Supreme Court held that the question of delay could still be tackled by the court since it is intertwined with the issue of negligence (Caltex v. CA, 212 SCRA 448; Bergado v. CA, 173 SCRA 497).
*   **Valuation of Loss:** The Court determined the value of the lost vehicle should be based on its fair market value at the time it was entrusted to the Respondent, potentially leading to disputes over valuation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **New Civil Code:** Articles 1165, 1174, 1262, 1265
*   **Rules of Evidence:** Section 1, Rule 131
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1572:** Requires accreditation for repair shops.
*   **DTI Ministry Order No. 32:** Requires insurance for customer's property.
*   **Cipriano v. CA, 263 SCRA 711:** Defines negligence *per se*.

**Ambiguities:**

* The police report submitted as evidence of the carnapping was not sufficient proof that there was no fault on the part of Respondent.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding Broadway Motor Sales Corporation liable for the loss of Jimmy Co's vehicle. The Court emphasized the delay in delivery, the presumption of fault, and the duty of care owed by the repair shop, particularly the failure to comply with registration and insurance requirements.
