## Legal Document Summary: Zomer Development Company, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (G.R. No. 150694)

**Core Issue:** Validity of a Real Estate Mortgage executed by Zomer Development (Zomer) to secure the obligations of IDHI Prime Aggregates (Prime Aggregates) to International Exchange Bank (IEB). Zomer claims the mortgage is *ultra vires* and its officers exceeded their authority.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Zomer mortgaged its properties to IEB to secure loans and credit facilities obtained by both Zomer *and* Prime Aggregates. The mortgage contains broad terms, securing "all obligations" of both entities, "whether direct or indirect, principal or secondary, absolute or contingent." Includes future obligations and modifications to loan terms.
*   **Board Resolution:** Zomer's board authorized its Treasurer and General Manager to execute the mortgage to secure a P60M credit line for Zomer and Prime Aggregates' term loan and "credit facility" with IEB. No specific limit was placed on the amount secured for Prime Aggregates beyond this initial approval.
* **"Continuing Security" Clause:** The mortgage purports to secure subsequent loans and credit facilities without the need for new agreements.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Zomer:** Liable for the obligations of Prime Aggregates to IEB, secured by the mortgaged properties. Potentially liable for all of Prime Aggregates' debts to IEB, regardless of the original P60M term loan limit, due to the broad language of the mortgage and the "continuing security" clause.
*   **IEB:** Obligation to properly notify Zomer of the foreclosure proceedings. IEB also bears the risk that the *ultra vires* defense is ultimately successful.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   ***Ultra Vires* Doctrine:** Zomer's primary argument is that it lacked the corporate power to mortgage its assets to secure a third party's debt. The SC has historically held a strict interpretation of corporate powers, but the SEC Opinion (cited by the CA) provides exceptions for subsidiaries and actions benefiting the corporation, which the court uses to justify enforcing the mortgage. The case highlights that strict interpretation of corporate powers can be relaxed where it advances the interests of the corp.
*   **Scope of Authority:** Zomer alleges its officers exceeded their authority by executing a mortgage with unlimited liability for Prime Aggregates. The key question is whether the Board Resolution provided sufficient authorization for the later loans extended to Prime Aggregates. This is complicated by the lack of a specific monetary limit and the use of broad terms like "credit facility."
*   **Contract of Adhesion/Ambiguity:** Zomer argues the mortgage documents were "contracts of adhesion" drafted by IEB and should be construed strictly against them under Article 1378 of the Civil Code. The broad, all-encompassing language of the mortgage could be viewed as ambiguous and interpreted in Zomer's favor, especially considering the accommodation nature of the contract for Prime Aggregates' benefit.
* **Waiver/Ratification:** The Court of Appeals deemed the mortgage intra vires, since the mortgage was for a "sister corporation", which enhanced, boosted and promoted the "family" interest owning both corporations. Additionally, the court held that Zomer was estopped from questioning its validity due to its inaction and acceptance of the benefits, arguing it ratified the unauthorized acts by acquiescence.
*   **Mootness:** The initial action for injunction was deemed moot because the foreclosure sale had already occurred and IEB consolidated title. However, the underlying issue of the mortgage's validity remains relevant in determining Zomer's potential liability and rights to redemption (if applicable under the former General Banking Law).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Union Bank v. CA (311 SCRA 795):** Cited by the CA, potentially for the general principles regarding injunction and foreclosure proceedings. (Not actually related, as it was a dispute involving a forgery of the loan)
*   **Republic v. CA (324 SCRA 569):** Zomer cited this to argue injunction should be available despite PD 385 (government financial institutions) when the foreclosure's propriety is in serious doubt.
*   **Article 1378, Civil Code:** Interpretation of ambiguous contracts, favoring the least transmission of rights when gratuitous.
*   **General Banking Law (Pre-2000 Amendments):** Relevant to the consolidation of title process.
* **Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company v. del Rosario and Jose (22 Phil. 433 (1912)):** Cited by Petitioner, regarding the use of mandatory injunction to restore status quo.

**Potential Strategy:**

Focus should be placed on establishing the ultra vires nature of the mortgage. Even if the mortgage is not *completely* void, its *scope* could be limited to the originally authorized amount (P60M). Furthermore, exploring arguments related to breach of contract, good faith, and/or fraud on the part of Prime Aggregates could potentially shift liability away from Zomer. Focus on whether "credit facility" was well-defined and authorized in the Board Resolution. It is also important to review the financial condition of Prime Aggregates at the time IEB extended additional loans, and the knowledge IEB had with respect to Prime Aggregates's ability to pay the additional credit.

**Note:** This is a preliminary summary and further investigation and document review is recommended.
