## Legal Document Summary: Dealco Farms, Inc. vs. NLRC, Bastida, and Caban (G.R. No. 153192)

**Nature:** Review of CA Resolutions dismissing a petition for certiorari related to an NLRC decision affirming a Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal and monetary awards.

**Key Issue:** Determination of employer-employee relationship between Dealco Farms, Inc. (petitioner) and Chiquito Bastida and Albert Caban (respondents), and the legality of their dismissal.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court **denies** Dealco Farms' petition, affirming the NLRC's decision which upheld the Labor Arbiter's ruling.  The court finds the CA correctly dismissed the petition for certiorari due to procedural defects.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:**  The court upheld the NLRC and Labor Arbiter's finding of an employer-employee relationship based on the **four-fold test:** (1) power to hire, (2) payment of wages, (3) power to dismiss, and (4) power to control. The *control test*, specifically the *right* to control, was deemed the most important element. Dealco Farms admitted engaging the services of the respondents and paying them P1,500 per trip. The preparation of the cattle for shipment, manning, feeding, and reporting back were all indicators of instruction, supervision, and control by Dealco Farms.
*   **Regular Employment (Art. 280 Labor Code):**  Even assuming the "comboy" task was not part of Dealco Farms' regular business, respondents qualified as regular employees because they rendered more than one year of service to the said activity.

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Based on a finding of employer-employee relationship, the court upheld the lower court's finding that the respondents were dismissed without just or authorized cause, thus illegally dismissed.

*   **Monetary Award:** Separation pay, COLA, and union service fees (10% of the total award) were affirmed.

**Obligations:**

*   Dealco Farms is obligated to pay Bastida and Caban separation pay (one month per year of service), COLA, and union service fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Dealco Farms is liable for the monetary awards.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the application of the four-fold test and Article 280 of the Labor Code in determining employment status, even in situations involving "per-trip" or "per-contract" arrangements.  The court's willingness to resolve doubts in favor of the laborer also creates risk for employers who fail to adequately document independent contractor relationships.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** Dealco Farms' failure to provide documentation proving payments from other entities who were supposedly hiring the respondents was detrimental to their case. Businesses should maintain meticulous records of all contractual relationships to mitigate risks.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 280:** Defines regular and casual employment.  Critical in determining that the respondents could be considered regular employees even if their task wasn't considered the primary function of the company.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Section 1; Rule 46 Section 3:** These Rules of Court outline the requirements for filing a petition for certiorari, particularly the required supporting documents. The court focused on the failure to comply with requirements regarding copies of relevant pleadings and documents.
*   **Four-Fold Test:** Standard test for determining employer-employee relationship.
*   **NFL v. Bibiana Farms (NLRC CA No. XI-065089-99):**  Distinguished from the present case because *NFL* involved documentary evidence (bills of lading) showing other shippers engaged and supervised the escorts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The nature of the "per-trip" or "per-contract" arrangement was a point of contention. Dealco Farms argued it was an independent contractor relationship, while the court ruled otherwise due to a lack of supporting documentation.
