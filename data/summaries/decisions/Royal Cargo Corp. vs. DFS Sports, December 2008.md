**Case Summary: Royal Cargo Corporation v. DFS Sports Unlimited, Inc. (G.R. No. 158621, December 10, 2008)**

**Nature of the Document:**  Decision of the Supreme Court resolving a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a collection suit filed by Royal Cargo Corporation (RCC) against DFS Sports Unlimited, Inc. (DFS).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **RCC's Claim:** RCC sought to recover P248,449.63 from DFS for brokerage, trucking, storage, and other services rendered between April and July 1994.
*   **DFS's Defense:**  DFS initially denied engaging RCC's services, except for one transaction. Later, during trial, DFS argued payment, presenting original invoices stamped "PAID" and "AUDITED."
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The Court reiterates the general rule that the burden of proving payment lies with the debtor (DFS). *See Citibank, N.A. v. Sabeniano, G.R. No. 156132, October 16, 2006*
*   **Sufficiency of Invoices as Proof of Payment:** The Court held that original invoices, even stamped "PAID" and "AUDITED" by the debtor's (DFS) own accounting and auditing departments, are *insufficient* evidence of payment.  An invoice is defined as a sales or commerical invoice, which a mere list or written account of goods sold or services rendered indicating the prices charged therefor or a list by whatever name it is known which is used in the ordinary course of business evidencing sale and transfer or agreement to sell or transfer goods and services as per (*Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Manila Mining Corporation, G.R. No. 153204, August 31, 2005)*. The Court distinguished invoices from receipts (written acknowledgment of the fact of payment). *See also Black's Law Dictionary*.
*   **Amendment of Pleadings:**  The Court acknowledged that even though DFS did not initially plead payment in its Answer, the RTC properly admitted evidence of payment under Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court, as no undue prejudice resulted to RCC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **DFS is liable** to RCC for the principal amount of P248,449.63.
*   **Interest:** 6% per annum from the date of extrajudicial demand (February 10, 1995) until the decision becomes final and executory, then 12% per annum until fully paid. *See Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994*
*   **Attorney's Fees:** DFS must pay RCC 10% of the total amount due as attorney's fees.  Based on a reasonable rate for attorney's fees and the Court considers that DFS acted in gross and evident bad faith. *See Article 2208 (2) and (5) of the Civil Code,  Santiago v. CF Sharp Crew Management, Inc., G.R. No. 162419, July 10, 2007*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Supporting Documentation:**  The most significant risk for DFS was the absence of official receipts or other documentary evidence to support its claim of payment.  This absence was heavily scrutinized by the Court.
*   **Delayed Assertion of Payment Defense:** DFS's delayed assertion of payment (not raised in the Answer or Pre-Trial Brief) could have been grounds for exclusion of evidence related to payment, but the Court ultimately allowed it, emphasizing the importance of substantial justice.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The reduction of the attorney's fees (stipulated at 20% in the invoices but reduced by the Court to 10%) highlights the Court's power to scrutinize and adjust contractual provisions deemed excessive.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1169, 2208
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 9, Section 1; Rule 10, Section 5; Rule 131, Section 3(h)

*   **Santiago v. CF Sharp Crew Management, Inc., G.R. No. 162419, July 10, 2007**
**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious point revolves around the evidentiary weight afforded to the "PAID" and "AUDITED" stamped invoices. While DFS argued they constituted proof of payment, the Court ultimately rejected this argument, emphasizing the need for more concrete evidence like official receipts.
