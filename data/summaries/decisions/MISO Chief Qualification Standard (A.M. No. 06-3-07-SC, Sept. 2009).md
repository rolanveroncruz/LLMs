**Document Summary: A.M. No. 06-3-07-SC - Revision of Qualification Standards for MISO and PMO Chiefs**

**Nature:** Supreme Court Resolution addressing the qualification standards (QS) for the Chief of the Management Information Systems Office (MISO) and the Judicial Reform Program Administrator (JRPA) of the Program Management Office (PMO).  It also deals with the Assistant Chief of Office positions within these departments.

**Key Provisions & Amendments:**

*   **Initial QS (1999):** Originally required a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), 10 years experience, 32 hours of training, and Bar eligibility (RA 1080) for the MISO Chief.
*   **2006 Revisions:** Shifted to a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (or comparable) with post-graduate IT units, 7 years relevant ICT experience, 40 hours training, and Civil Service/IT eligibility. Differentiated between lawyer and non-lawyer appointees: Lawyers received the collatilla "Deputy Clerk of Court" and judicial rank (RTC Judge).
*   **Current Resolution (2009):** Acknowledges the importance of both legal knowledge and specialized technical skills for the Chief positions.  It balances the need for uniformity with the specialized functions of each office.
    *   **Chief, MISO & JRPA (PMO):** Approved QS allows for either:
        *   Bachelor of Laws with 18 units in relevant computer/IT academic courses OR
        *   Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/IT (or relevant field for JRPA) *and* a post-graduate degree (preferably in Computer Science/IT or relevant field for JRPA).
        *   Both require 10 years relevant supervisory experience (5 years in relevant specialty) and 32 hours training in management and supervision/project management.
        *   Eligibility: RA 1080 (Bar), CSC Professional, or IT eligibility.
    *   **Assistant Chief, MISO & Deputy JRPA (PMO):** LLB with units in relevant areas or post-graduate units in relevant areas. 10 years relevant experience (3 years specialized). Eligibility requirements are RA 1080 (Bar) or any CSC 2nd level eligibility.
    *   **Judicial Ranking:** Reaffirms the 2006 Resolution.  If the appointee is a lawyer, they receive the "Deputy Clerk of Court" collatilla and judicial rank (RTC Judge).  Otherwise, they are considered a Chief of Office without judicial rank.

**Obligations:** Sets the mandatory minimum requirements for individuals to hold these positions within the Supreme Court system.

**Liabilities:** Failure to meet the QS could disqualify candidates from appointment or result in removal from the position.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Equally Comparable Degree":** The term "equally comparable degree" for computer science may lead to disputes regarding equivalent academic qualifications.  This is applicable to educational requirements for Chief, MISO, and Assistant Chief MISO.
*   **"Relevant Experience":** The definition of "relevant experience" (e.g., in IT, donor coordination, or project management) is open to interpretation and could be subject to challenges during the application process.
*   **CSC Eligibility:** The level of CSC eligibility required for Assistant Chiefs and Deputy JRPA needs clarification to avoid inconsistencies in appointments.
* **Impact on existing personnel:** The Resolution does not explicitly address how it applies to individuals currently holding these positions who may not fully meet the new QS. Could lead to displacement or pressure to meet the new qualifications.

**Statutory References:**

*   RA 1080 (Bar):  Refers to the law regulating admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.

**Case Law Considerations:** There are no specific case law citations in the provided document.  However, interpretations of civil service eligibility and qualification standards by the Civil Service Commission and the Supreme Court (in similar personnel cases) would be relevant.
