**Case Summary: *Isidro T. Pajarillaga vs. Court of Appeals and Thomas T. Kalangeg*, G.R. No. 163515, October 31, 2008**

**Issue:** Whether the trial court erred in denying Petitioner's Motion for Leave to Take Deposition Upon Written Interrogatories after the Plaintiff (private respondent) had rested his case.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the trial court's denial of the motion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 23, Section 4 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the use of depositions. The Court outlined conditions under which depositions can be used, including the witness's residence being more than 100 kilometers from the place of trial (Rule 23, Sec. 4(c)(2)), or inability to attend due to illness (Rule 23, Sec. 4(c)(3)) or exceptional circumstances. The court highlighted Section 4(c)(5) emphasizing 'the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court.'
*   **Availability of Discovery:** While depositions are a recognized discovery tool and can be taken at any stage of the proceedings, the Court held that their use is not absolute, and the trial court retains discretion to disallow them. *Republic v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 112710, May 30, 2001) cited to this effect.
*   **Deposition for Perpetuation of Testimony:** The Court acknowledges that deposition can be taken even after trial has commenced and may be used without the deponent being called to the witness stand citing *Jonathan Landoil International Co., Inc. v. Mangudadatu, G.R. No. 155010, August 16, 2004, 436 SCRA 559, 574*.
*   **Duty to Prosecute Case Diligently:** The Petitioner's repeated postponements and absences weighed against allowing the deposition.
*   **Evidence Admissibility:** Lack of substantiation for claims (e.g., unsubstantiated medical certificate, belatedly alleged threats) weakened the basis for allowing the deposition.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Waiver of Right to Present Evidence:**  The trial court explicitly warned the Petitioner that failure to present evidence at the next hearing would result in waiver of that right. The court found that delay tactic should not be tolerated.
*   **Costs:** Petitioner was ordered to pay costs.
*   **Preclusion of Evidence:** The denial of the deposition effectively precluded the Petitioner's intended testimony.
*   **Risk of Default Judgment:**  The court found that the Petitioner was delaying the case at his own risk.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "exceptional circumstances" provision of Rule 23, Sec. 4(c)(5) is inherently subjective and open to interpretation. The Court found that the circumstances presented by the Petitioner did not meet the threshold for "exceptional."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Dulay v. Dulay*, G.R. No. 158857, November 11, 2005, 474 SCRA 674, 681 (Purpose of deposition)
*   *Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corp. v. Ley Construction and Development Corp.*, G.R. No. 147143, March 10, 2006, 484 SCRA 286, 301 (Broad scope of deposition)
*   *Jonathan Landoil International Co., Inc. v. Mangudadatu*, G.R. No. 155010, August 16, 2004, 436 SCRA 559, 574 (Deposition can be taken even after trial has commenced)
*   *Republic v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 112710, May 30, 2001, 358 SCRA 284, 298 (Court may disallow deposition)

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   Demonstrate exceptional circumstances or specific hardship that justifies deposition *prior* to trial.
*   Address issues of distance and health proactively, well in advance of trial. Consider a Motion for Change of Venue.
*   Substantiate health-related claims with clear and unambiguous medical documentation, preferably notarized.
*   Avoid delays and ensure diligent prosecution of the defense to avoid the appearance of obstruction.
