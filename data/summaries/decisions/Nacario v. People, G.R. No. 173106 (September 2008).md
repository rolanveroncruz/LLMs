**Case Summary: *Cosme Nacario v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 173106, September 30, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Frustrated Homicide.

**Facts:** Petitioner Nacario was charged with Frustrated Murder for stabbing Medardo de Villa. Nacario admitted the stabbing but claimed self-defense, alleging that de Villa initiated the attack with a *balisong*.  The RTC rejected the self-defense claim and convicted Nacario of Frustrated Homicide. The Court of Appeals affirmed, modifying the penalty to reflect Nacario's voluntary surrender.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Charge:** Initially Frustrated Murder, reduced to Frustrated Homicide.
*   **Defense:** Self-defense.  Petitioner has the burden to prove the elements of self-defense: (1) unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.
*   **Penalty:** Affirmed, imprisonment from two (2) years and four months of *prision correccional* in its minimum period, as minimum, to six (6) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* in its minimum period, as maximum.
*   **Damages:** Ordered to pay P2,261.55 as actual damages, P30,000.00 as moral damages and P30,000 as temperate damages. P25,000.00 indemnity by RTC was deleted for lack of legal basis.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Conviction for Frustrated Homicide affirmed.
*   **Civil Liability:** Obligation to pay actual, moral, and temperate damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Rejection:** The core risk is the rejection of self-defense. The Courts found that unlawful aggression ceased when Nacario disarmed the victim.  The supposed subsequent act of the victim picking up stones does not justify the stabbing because an "interval of time" existed allowing Nacario to retreat. The court found Nacarioâ€™s version of events to be inconsistent and not credible.
*   **Credibility Issues:** Nacario's varying accounts of the events (attack with a stone, picking up of stones) undermine his credibility. The lack of visible injury also weakens his self-defense claim.
*   **Assessment of Aggression:** The case hinges on the point at which aggression is deemed to have ceased. The courts ruled it ceased once Nacario possessed the knife, thus making his actions no longer considered in self defense.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 11:** Defines justifying circumstances, including self-defense.  This is the central statutory provision.
*   ***People v. Ebmerga***, G.R. 116616, November 26, 1999, 319 SCRA 304: Cited to support the principle that self-defense cannot be claimed once the imminent risk or danger to life has ceased.
*   **New Civil Code, Article 2219:** Basis for awarding moral damages.
*   ***Santos v. Court of Appeals***, 461 Phil. 36 (2003): Cited as jurisprudence supporting the award of moral damages.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Interval of Time":** The interpretation of the "interval of time" between the victim being disarmed and the stabbing is crucial. How long was the interval? Did it truly provide Nacario with a safe opportunity to retreat?
*   **Nature of Aggression:** The subjective belief of Nacario regarding the continued threat posed by the victim (even after disarming) is potentially contentious. The court did not give credence to the argument that there was a fear of threat to his life.

**Recommendations (For Lawyer):**

1.  **Focus on Credibility:** Emphasize consistency in the narrative of self-defense.
2.  **Re-evaluate Facts:** Check accuracy of evidence presented for actual damages.
3.  **Aggression Argument:** Could one potentially argue that even after disarming the victim, the act of picking up stones to throw can be deemed as continuous aggression? It will be a hard sell but if you can argue the act, the defense might work.
4.  **Mitigating Circumstances:** Mitigation of damages (if any) due to his surrender and/or other possible circumstances.
5.  **Possible Appeal:** Appeal may be limited since CA already affirmed. But appeal to the Supreme Court if you can argue something that has been overlooked.
