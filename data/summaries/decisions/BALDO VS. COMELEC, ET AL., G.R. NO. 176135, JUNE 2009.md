Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case Name:** *Carlos Irwin G. Baldo, Jr. vs. Commission on Elections, et al.* (G.R. No. 176135, June 16, 2009)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari challenging COMELEC's resolution to include 26 contested election returns (ERs) in the canvassing of votes for the 2004 Camalig, Albay mayoral election. Petitioner Baldo alleged grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC in affirming the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBOC) ruling. Baldo raised objections to the ERs based on issues such as missing seals, lack of material data, missing signatures, and claims of duress.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Baldo argued that the 26 contested ERs should have been excluded from the canvass due to material defects, as defined under Section 243(b) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). The defects included missing seals, lack of signatures, and claims of duress during ER preparation. He asserted that COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in affirming the MBOC's decision to include them.
*   **Respondent's (COMELEC) Position:** COMELEC affirmed the MBOC's decision, effectively ruling that the alleged defects were not sufficient to warrant the exclusion of the ERs. The specifics of COMELEC's rationale for each type of defect isn't provided in detail, but presumably, they found the defects to be either non-existent or immaterial.
*   **Relevant Statutory References:** Section 243(b) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC). This section likely outlines the grounds for excluding ERs in pre-proclamation controversies.
* COMELEC ordered the MBOC to summon members from the Board of Election Inspectors from precinct No. 127B to complete necessary data in the ER.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **MBOC's Obligation:** Initially, the MBOC had the obligation to properly canvass the votes and resolve objections to the ERs. The COMELEC ordered the MBOC to summon members of the BEI.
*   **COMELEC's Obligation:** COMELEC had the obligation to review the MBOC's decisions and ensure compliance with election laws.
*   **No Specific Liabilities:** The document does not detail any specific monetary or other liabilities.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Material Defects":** The interpretation of what constitutes "material defects" under Section 243(b) of the OEC is critical. The COMELEC's determination of materiality is a key point of contention. The lack of specifics on the nature of the defects makes it difficult to assess the strength of Baldo's claims.
*   **Premature Proclamation:** The MBOC's proclamation of Mu√±oz as the winner while the case was pending before COMELEC could be a point of contention, raising questions of potential bias.
*   **Mootness:** The most significant risk is the mootness of the case due to the expiration of the term of office and Baldo subsequently winning the next election.

**Case Law & Precedent:**

*   The Court cites *Malaluan v. COMELEC* (324 Phil. 676, 683 (1996)), *Villarico v. Court of Appeals* (424 Phil. 26, 33-34 (2002)), *Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, 371 Phil. 30, 43 (1999))* , *Lanuza, Jr. v. Yuchengco, G.R. No. 157033, 28 March 2005, 454 SCRA 130, 138*, *Garcia v. COMELEC* (328 Phil. 288 (1996)), and *Gancho-on v. Secretary of Labor and Employment, (337 Phil. 654, 658 (1997))* establishing the principle that a case becomes moot when the term of office contested has expired, precluding the granting of any practical relief.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition due to mootness, as Baldo's term of office had expired and he had subsequently won the next election.  The court reasoned that no practical relief could be granted, rendering any decision on the merits an academic exercise. The Court held that deciding the case would have no practical use or value.
