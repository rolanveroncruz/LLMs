Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Sps. Jesus Ching and Lee Poe Tin vs. Sps. Adolfo & Arsenia Enrile* G.R. No. 156076, September 17, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari involving a dispute over real property and an action to quiet title.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Ching) purchased a property from La Fuente in 1985 via a Deed of Absolute Sale but failed to register the deed under Section 51 of PD 1529.
*   Instead, Petitioners registered an Affidavit of Adverse Claim on the title in 1986.
*   Respondents (Enrile) levied on the same property in 1988 pursuant to a Writ of Execution from a separate case against La Fuente and subsequently registered the Notice of Levy and Certificate of Sale on the title.
*   Petitioners filed an action to quiet title.

**Issue:** Who has the preferential right to the disputed property?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Petitioners (Ching). The Court of Appeals decision was reversed and the RTC decision was affirmed.

**Key Provisions and Rationale:**

*   **Adverse Claim:** The Court held that the adverse claim, while initially effective for 30 days under Section 70 of PD 1529, remains valid and subsisting until a petition for its cancellation is filed and granted. *Sajonas v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No 102377, July 5, 1996, 258 SCRA 79.
*   **Purchaser in Good Faith:** The Court found that Respondents (Enrile) were not purchasers in good faith because the Petitioners' adverse claim was annotated on the title. This annotation, coupled with the Petitioners' actual possession of the property, constituted constructive notice of a prior existing interest.
*   **Article 1544 of the Civil Code (Double Sale):** While registration generally prevails in cases of double sale, knowledge of a prior unregistered interest negates good faith. *Leung Yee v. F.L. Strong Machinery Co. and Williamson*, No. 11658, 37 Phil. 644, 651 (1918). Knowledge of the unregistered sale is equivalent to registration (*Winkleman v. Veluz*, 43 Phil. 604, 608 (1922)).
*   **Superior Right:** Because Respondents (Enrile) had constructive notice of the prior sale to Petitioners (Ching), they could not be considered purchasers in good faith and therefore did not acquire a superior right to the property.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   Respondents are required to pay the petitioners the sum of P10,000 as compensatory damages by way of litigation expenses
*   Respondents are required to pay the petitioners the sum of P10,000 as attorney's fees;

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The decision emphasizes the importance of registering deeds promptly. Failure to register under Section 51 of PD 1529 creates the risk that a subsequent good faith purchaser will acquire superior rights.
*   The ruling highlights the importance of actual and constructive notice in determining good faith. Parties dealing with registered land must investigate any existing annotations on the title and be aware of any visible possession by someone other than the registered owner.

**Statutory References:**

*   PD 1529, Sections 51 and 70 (Property Registration Decree)
*   Article 1544 of the Civil Code (Double Sale)

**Case Law:**

*   Sajonas v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No 102377, July 5, 1996, 258 SCRA 79
*   Leung Yee v. F.L. Strong Machinery Co. and Williamson, No. 11658, 37 Phil. 644, 651 (1918)
*   Winkleman v. Veluz, 43 Phil. 604, 608 (1922)
