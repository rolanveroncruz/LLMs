Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Jose Sy Bang (deceased), et al. vs. Rosauro Sy (deceased), et al.*, G.R. No. 179955, April 24, 2009 (604 Phil. 606).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, appealing the CA's reversal of the RTC's grant of a Petition for Relief.  The ultimate issue is the reinstatement of a Petition for Quieting of Title.

**Facts:**

*   Sy Bang died intestate in 1971, leaving properties to heirs from two marriages.
*   1980: Heirs from the second marriage filed a Complaint for Partition (Civil Case No. 8578) against Jose Sy Bang (from the first marriage) and others.  A *lis pendens* was annotated on several TCTs.
*   1982: RTC's Third Partial Decision declared properties in the names of Jose Sy Bang, his wife, and children belonged to Sy Bang's estate. Affirmed by CA. This is currently pending appeal in Supreme Court (G.R. No. 114217).
*   The *lis pendens* annotations were cancelled.
*   Respondents (from the second marriage) sought re-annotation of *lis pendens*; denied by Register of Deeds and upheld by Land Registration Authority (LRA) (Consulta No. 2471) based on Section 108 of PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree).
*   1996: Petitioners (Jose Sy Bang's heirs) filed a Petition for Quieting of Title (Civil Case No. 96-81) to prevent interference with their property rights.
*   Original counsel, Atty. Santos, later, without proper authorization, filed a "Manifestation" seeking dismissal of the Quieting of Title case, which the RTC granted in 2002.

**Procedural History & Key Rulings:**

*   **RTC (Lucena City, Branch 57):** Initially denied Respondents' Motion to Dismiss (based on Civil Case No. 8578).  Later *granted* Atty. Santos' "Manifestation" to dismiss the Quieting of Title case. Then, **Granted Petitioners' Petition for Relief**, finding *extrinsic fraud* by Atty. Santos.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** *Reversed*, holding that Atty. Santos' actions bind his clients and that no *extrinsic fraud* was proven.  Relied on *Tolentino v. Leviste* regarding the binding nature of counsel's actions. CA dismissed the petition for quieting of title.
*   **Supreme Court (SC):** *Reversed the CA*, holding that *extrinsic fraud* *was* established. SC reinstated the Quieting of Title case.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Rule 38, Rules of Court:**  Governs petitions for relief from judgment based on fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence.  Crucially, the fraud must be *extrinsic*.
*   **PD 1529, Section 108:** Governs the alteration and amendment of certificates of title.
*   **Attorney-Client Relationship:** General rule is that clients are bound by their counsel's actions.  However, *extrinsic fraud* or gross negligence can be an exception.
*   **Lis Pendens:** The *lis pendens* is central to the underlying property dispute and the ability of the second-marriage heirs to challenge the titles held by Jose Sy Bang's heirs.
*   **Obligation:** Atty. Santos had an obligation to act in the best interests of his clients and with their informed consent.

**Case Law References (Implied & Express):**

*   *Tolentino v. Leviste:*  Cited by the CA regarding the binding effect of counsel's actions on clients.
*   SC also implicitly recognized and applied the well-established jurisprudence on extrinsic fraud.
*   *Garcia v. Court of Appeals*: defines extrinsic fraud.
*   *Laxamana v. Court of Appeals*: defines extrinsic fraud, specifically regarding lawyers
*   *Mercado v. Security Bank Corporation*: defines extrinsic fraud.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Authorization of Atty. Santos:** The central dispute revolves around whether Atty. Santos had proper authority to dismiss the Quieting of Title case.  His initial "Manifestation" claimed full client support, but later statements suggested limited consultation.
*   **Nature of the Fraud:**  The CA argued against *extrinsic fraud*. The SC disagreed, finding that Atty. Santos prevented the petitioners from fully presenting their case.
*   **Bank Records:** The disappearance of bank records related to Jose Sy Bang's alleged loans to purchase the properties is a potential evidentiary weakness for the petitioners in the underlying Quieting of Title case.
* The Third Partial Decision pending appeal could significantly alter the outcome of the quieting of title case.

**Potential Risks & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners:** The pending appeal of the Third Partial Decision may influence the outcome of the quieting of title action and any final resolution may require additional action for any properties that may have been transferred from Jose Sy Bang. Also, that court can find a way to argue there isn't an actual prevention in presenting evidence.
*   **Respondents:** Risks further litigation in the Quieting of Title case. They must effectively rebut the evidence of the petitioners and deal with the adverse ruling on the claim of extrinsic fraud.
*   **Breach of fiduciary duty by Attorney**: Attorney may be disciplined or sanctioned for failure to follow client direction.

**Summary:**

This case involves a protracted family dispute over inheritance and property rights. The immediate issue is whether the prior dismissal of a Petition for Quieting of Title should be reversed due to extrinsic fraud by the petitioners' former attorney. The Supreme Court found that the attorney's unauthorized actions prevented the petitioners from fully presenting their case and reinstated the Quieting of Title case. The underlying dispute and the pending appeal of the Third Partial Decision are still outstanding.
