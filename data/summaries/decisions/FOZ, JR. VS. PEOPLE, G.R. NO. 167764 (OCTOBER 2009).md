**Case Summary: Foz, Jr. vs. People, G.R. No. 167764, October 9, 2009 (Libel)**

**Core Issue:** The Supreme Court (SC) addressed whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City had jurisdiction over a libel case against the petitioners, columnist Vicente Foz, Jr. and Editor/Publisher Danny G. Fajardo. The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction.

**Key Holding:** The SC *reversed* the CA decision and *dismissed* the case due to lack of jurisdiction in the RTC.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 4363):**  This article governs venue in libel cases. Critical to this case, the SC emphasized the specific venue rules:
    *   For private individuals (like the complainant, Dr. Portigo), the case must be filed where (1) the libelous article was *printed and first published*, *or* (2) where the offended party *actually resided* at the time of the offense.
*   **Information Deficiency:**  The Information only alleged that "*Panay News* [the publication] has a considerable circulation in Iloilo City." The SC held this insufficient to establish that Iloilo City was the place where the newspaper was *printed and first published.* The court distinguished between general circulation and actual place of printing and initial publication, relying on *Chavez v. Court of Appeals.*
*   **Residence of Complainant:** The Information alleged that Dr. Portigo was a "physician and medical practitioner in Iloilo City," but failed to specifically allege that he *resided* there at the time of the offense.  Citing *Agustin v. Pamintuan,* the SC found this insufficient to establish venue based on the complainant's residence.  The court emphasized that simply working in a place does not equate to residence for venue purposes.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue Raised Late:** While petitioners raised the jurisdictional issue for the first time in their Reply before the SC, the court asserted that challenges to subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any stage of proceedings (citing *Fukuzume v. People*). Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Conviction overturned due to improper venue. No immediate legal liability.
*   **Prosecution:** Failed to properly plead and prove facts necessary to establish jurisdiction in the RTC of Iloilo City.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Re-filing:** The dismissal is *without prejudice*.  The prosecution *could* re-file the case in a court with proper jurisdiction if the evidence supports proper venue.
*   **Ambiguity in "First Published":** The decision reaffirms the need for specificity in pleading the location where the alleged libelous article was "printed and first published." This standard leaves room for interpretation and may require factual investigation regarding the publishing process.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Article 360, Revised Penal Code (RA 4363):** The central statutory provision.
*   **Fukuzume v. People, G.R. No. 143647, November 11, 2005:**  Addresses raising jurisdictional issues late in proceedings.
*   **Macasaet v. People, G.R. No. 156747, February 23, 2005:** Establishes that jurisdiction is determined by allegations in the complaint/information.
*   **Chavez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125813, February 6, 2007:** Critical precedent regarding sufficiency of allegations for the "printed and first published" prong of Article 360. General circulation is not printing/publishing.
*   **Agustin v. Pamintuan, G.R. No. 164938, August 22, 2005:** Addresses sufficiency of allegations regarding residence of the complainant. Work address is not residence.
*   **Agbayani v. Sayo, 178 Phil. 579 (1979):** Restatement of the venue rules in Art. 360.
