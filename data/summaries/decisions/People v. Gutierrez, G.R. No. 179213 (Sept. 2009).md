Here's a legal summary of *People vs. Gutierrez*, G.R. No. 179213, highlighting key issues and potential risks.

**Case Summary: *People v. Gutierrez*, G.R. No. 179213**

**Issue:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Nicolas Gutierrez ("Appellant") for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) for the illegal sale of 0.05 grams of *shabu*.  Appellant was acquitted of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia under Section 12.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals decision and *acquitted* the Appellant. The prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to a break in the chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.

**Key Provisions/Elements of the Offense (Sec. 5, Art. II, R.A. 9165):**

*   Requires proof of: (1) the identity of the buyer and seller; (2) the object and consideration; and (3) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.
*   *Corpus delicti* in narcotics cases is the narcotic substance itself.

**Critical Analysis of Evidence:**

*   **Chain of Custody Failure:** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody. There was no evidence presented describing how the seized item was handled between the turnover from the arresting officer to the investigator and its turnover for laboratory examination. This absence of testimony regarding handling and security raised significant doubts about the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Stipulations, Limited in Scope:** The defense stipulations during pre-trial regarding the existence of the specimen, its examination, and the positive result for methylamphetamine hydrochloride were interpreted by the court as merely dispensing with the forensic chemist's testimony and abbreviating the proceedings, and could not be interpreted as an admission of the source of the drug. It did not waive objections related to chain of custody.
*   **Non-Compliance with Sec. 21, R.A. 9165:** The buy-bust team failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21, Paragraph 1 of Article II of R.A. 9165. Notably, there was no physical inventory and photograph of the *shabu* in the presence of the accused, his representative/counsel, and representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as required. No explanation was provided for this non-compliance.
*   **Presumption of Regularity Overcome:** The court held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty does not apply when the actions of law enforcement deviate from established procedures or rules, as prescribed in law.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sec. 5, Art. II:** Defines the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.

*   **People v. Obmiranis, G.R. No. 181492, December 16, 2008:** On the limited scope of the presumption of regularity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The differing testimonies regarding pre-arranged signals were brought up as potentially damaging credibility, but not critical for the court's final decision. The critical issue was the insufficient evidence of the chain of custody.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities (for Law Enforcement):**

*   **Suppression of Evidence:** Failure to strictly adhere to chain of custody requirements and Section 21 of R.A. 9165 will likely result in the suppression of evidence and acquittal of the accused.
*   **Liability for Evidence Tampering:** Breaks in the chain of custody create opportunities for evidence tampering, which could expose law enforcement officers to criminal and civil liability.
*   **Wrongful Prosecution:** Disregard for procedural safeguards increases the risk of wrongful prosecution and conviction of innocent individuals.
