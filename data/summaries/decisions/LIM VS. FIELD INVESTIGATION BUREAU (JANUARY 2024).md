## Legal Document Summary: *Lim v. Field Investigation Bureau*

**Case:** *Mark Franklin A. Lim II v. Field Investigation Bureau, Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for the Military and Other Law Enforcement Offices [MOLEO]* G.R. No. 253448, January 22, 2024.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision affirming the OMB-MOLEO's finding of administrative liability.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Petitioner Lim, Head of the Coast Guard Special Service Office (CGSSO), was found by the OMB-MOLEO guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and dismissed, due to findings related to Special Cash Advances (SCA).
*   The allegations stemmed from a COA audit finding irregularities in PCG’s SCAs, including Lim’s PHP 500,000.00 SCA for office supplies and IT equipment. COA noted lack of required office orders designating Special Disbursing Officers (SDOs), missing address info, and denials from suppliers of issuing invoices/receipts.
*   The alleged irregularities included Lim acting as an SDO without proper designation and procuring goods without public bidding as required by RA 9184.
*   Lim presented Special Order No. 48 as his designation as SDO and justified the lack of public bidding due to emergency procurement during Typhoon Yolanda relief operations.
*   The criminal charges associated were dismissed by the Ombudsman.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **Partly Granted** the petition.
*   **Finding of the Court:**
    *   The Court modified the ruling of the Court of Appeals.
    *   Lim was found **Guilty** of the administrative offense of **Simple Misconduct** only.
    *   Court found the OMB-MOLEO erred in finding Lim was not properly designated as an SDO; Special Order No. 48 did designate Lim as SDO.
    *   Court found there was a transgression of the law on procurement. However, there was no sufficient evidence on record showing Lim concealed or distorted the truth regarding the purchase of goods (no dishonesty found).
    *   Court found simple misconduct instead of grave misconduct: The OMB-MOLEO failed to prove the act was tainted with corruption and a clear intent to violate the law or the rules. Court found Lim failed to comply with the requirements of RA 9184.
    *   Sanction: Suspension for one month and one day.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   While Lim claimed emergency procurement excused public bidding, the court emphasized his obligation as Head of the CGSSO to ensure compliance with procurement rules, including securing prior approval from the Head of Procuring Entity (HoPE) upon recommendation from the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) when resorting to alternative procurement methods (Section 48, RA 9184).
*   As SDO, he was presumed to know existing laws, rules, policies, and regulations in carrying out his mandate.
*   Liability stems from violation of procurement rules and failing to ensure proper procedures for emergency procurement.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Emergency Procurement Justification:** The court acknowledges the context of Typhoon Yolanda but emphasizes procedural requirements for emergency procurement. This highlights a risk for public officers relying on exigent circumstances without meticulously following established legal protocols.
*   **Ambiguity:** Definition of "Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service"
*   **Risk:** Failing to comply with procurement rules.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Central to the decision, particularly Section 48 regarding alternative procurement methods and the requirement for HoPE approval.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 217:** Malversation of Public Funds through falsification
*   **RA 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Section 3(e).
*   **2011 Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2011 RRACCS):** Used to determine penalty for simple misconduct, considering mitigating circumstances like first offense and length of service (Sections 46(D)(2), 48, 49(a)).
*   **Rodil v. Posadas:** Clarifies the distinction between misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   **Jurisprudence:** Various citations define dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

**Conclusion:**

The ruling reduces Lim's administrative liability to simple misconduct, highlighting the importance of proper procedures for emergency procurement under RA 9184.
