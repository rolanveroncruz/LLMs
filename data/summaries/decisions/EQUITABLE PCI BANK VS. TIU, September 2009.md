**Case:** *Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. v. Heirs of Antonio C. Tiu*, G.R. No. 178529 (2009)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and dismissed a case filed by the heirs of Antonio C. Tiu seeking to annul an Amendment to Real Estate Mortgage (AREM) executed by Antonio Tiu in favor of Equitable PCI Bank. The AREM secured loans obtained by Gabriel Ching. The basis for the requested annulment was the lack of valid consent from Antonio's wife, Matilde, due to alleged Alzheimer's disease at the time of execution.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage (REM) and Amendment to Real Estate Mortgage (AREM):** Antonio Tiu mortgaged property to secure loans. The AREM increased the secured amount.
*   **Marital Consent:** Both the REM and AREM contained a signature attributed to Antonio's wife, Matilde, above the words "With my Marital Consent."
*   **Civil Code Article 1397:**  Governs the action for annulment of contracts, stating it can be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Sections 2 and 3:** Defines "real party in interest" as the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit and addresses representatives as parties.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Antonio Tiu: Primary obligor of the mortgage.
*   Matilde Tiu: Potentially a primary obligor due to marital consent on a presumptively conjugal property.
*   Gabriel Ching: Original borrower whose debt was secured by the mortgage.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Defect:** The action was filed by the heirs without impleading Matilde or having a legal guardian act on her behalf if she were indeed incapacitated.
*   **Cause of Action Issues:** The Court found the heirs lacked a cause of action, as Matilde was the real party in interest since the property was conjugal.
*   **Validity of Marital Consent:** The allegation of Matilde's Alzheimer's raises a question about the validity of her consent to the mortgage.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1397:** Defines who can institute an action for annulment of contracts.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Sections 2 and 3:** Defines and identifies the "real party in interest" in civil actions.
*   *Travel Wide Associated, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 77356 (1991): Cited by the petitioner, arguing the action should be brought in the name of the party in interest (Matilde).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Matilde's Consent:** The central issue revolves around whether Matilde could provide valid consent given her alleged condition. The AREM is potentially voidable if her consent was not freely given and informed.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The decision hinges on the procedural requirement of real party in interest. Substantive issues regarding the validity of consent were not fully addressed but remain relevant if Matilde were to properly bring an action. The presumption of conjugality of the property is also relevant.
*   The case highlights the importance of proper legal representation, particularly for incapacitated individuals.
*   The dismissal was without prejudice to Matilde filing a separate action, should she be deemed capable or through a duly appointed guardian.
