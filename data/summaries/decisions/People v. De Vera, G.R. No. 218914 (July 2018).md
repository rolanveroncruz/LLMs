## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Vera y Medina*

**Citation:** 837 Phil. 348 (G.R. No. 218914, July 30, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Henry De Vera y Medina for violation of Sections 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs) and 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) of Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sec. 5 (Sale):** Prohibits the sale, trading, etc., of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) identity of buyer/seller, object, and consideration; and (2) delivery and payment.
*   **RA 9165, Sec. 11 (Possession):** Prohibits unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) possession; (2) lack of legal authorization; and (3) free and conscious possession.
*   **RA 9165, Sec. 21 (Chain of Custody):** Mandates specific procedures for custody and disposition of seized drugs. Requires immediate physical inventory and photographing after seizure in the presence of the accused, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the DOJ, and an elected public official. This must occur at the place of seizure, nearest police station, or nearest office of the apprehending team.  Applies to buy-bust operations, consent searches, Terry searches, plain view doctrine, stop and frisk situations, search incident to a lawful arrest and arrests or searches that are not pre-arranged.
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Sec. 21(a):** Further clarifies that a warrantless seizure can have the inventory done at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team,
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Sec. 21(a) - Saving Clause:** Excuses non-compliance with Sec. 21 requirements if there are justifiable grounds AND the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.
*   **Marking:** Marking of seized evidence in the presence of the apprehended person and immediately upon confiscation is part of the chain of custody.

**Liabilities:**

*   De Vera was convicted of violating Sec. 5 (Life Imprisonment + P5,000,000 fine) and Sec. 11 (12 years and 1 day to 20 years imprisonment + P300,000 fine) by the RTC and CA.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Breaches:**
    *   Lack of all three mandated witnesses (media, DOJ, and elected public official) present during and at the location of the seizure.
    *   Inventory and photographing not conducted "immediately after seizure" at the location of seizure or nearest permissible location, which can include the nearest office of the apprehending team or the nearest police station.
    *   Absence of the accused or his representative during the marking, physical inventory, and photographing.
    *   Discrepancy in the weight of drugs seized vs. weight of drugs examined (1.32 grams vs. 0.81 grams).
*   **Insufficient Justification for Non-Compliance:** Prosecution failed to acknowledge and credibly justify the non-compliance with Sec. 21, preventing the triggering of the saving clause. The prosecution didn't acknowledge the breaches of the police officers, leading to doubts regarding the integrity of the evidence and reasonable doubt.
*   **Dubious Factual Narrative:** Discrepancy between market value of the drugs (P9,150 for 0.61 gram) and the buy-bust purchase price (P5,000) creates doubt about the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation.
*   **Photographic Evidence Deficiency:** Failure to present photographs of the seized illegal drugs undermines the integrity of evidence.
*   **Presumption of Regularity Misapplication:** The prosecution and lower courts wrongly relied on the presumption of regularity of the arresting officers despite clear violations of Section 21, as this presumption cannot prevail over the constitutional right to presumed innocence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Established Requirements of Sec. 5 & Sec. 11 of RA 9165** - *People v. Casacop*
*   **Ensuring Integrity and Identity of Illicit Drugs** - *People v. Abetong, People v. Valencia, People v. Del Mundo, People v. Gayoso, People v. Lorenzo*
*   **Importance of the Chain of Custody** - *People v. Dahil*
*   **Requirements for the Time, Witnesses, and Proof of Inventory** - *People v. Dela Cruz*

*   **Exceptions to Strict Compliance with Prescribed Procedure Under Sec. 21** - *People v. Cayas, People v. Havana, People v. Sanchez*
*   **Requirements to Trigger the Saving Clause of Sec. 21** - *People v. Valencia, People v. Cayas, People v. Barte, People v. Sumili*
*   **Importance of Accused's Presence During the Chain of Custody** - *People v. Beran, People v. Ismael*
*   **Importance of Sec. 21: The Obligation of the Apprehending Officers** - *People v. Jugo, People v. Cayas*
*   **Wide Discrepancy Between the Weight of Seized Substance** - *People v. Pornillos*
*   **Justifiable Grounds for the Failure of The Prosecution to Comply with Sec. 21** - *People v. Aneslag*
*   **The Saving Clause of the IRR of RA 9165** - *People v. Umipang*
*   **Presumption of Regularity and Its Limits** - *People v. Kamad, People v. Pagaura*
*   **The Need for Prosecutors to Acknowledge Lapses** - *People v. Ramirez, People v. Miranda, People v. Paz, People v. Mamangon, People v. Saragena, People v. Sagana, People v. Gajo*
*   **The Jurisdiction Between Congress and Judiciary** - *People v. Teng Moner y Adam*

**Outcome:**  The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* De Vera due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court emphasized the prosecution's failure to comply with Sec. 21 of RA 9165, particularly with the requirement of immediate inventory/photographing in the presence of required witnesses, and its failure to justify non-compliance. This case shows that a buy-bust operation can be ruled invalid based on police protocol.
