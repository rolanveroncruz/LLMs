**Case Summary: Nasi-Villar v. People, G.R. No. 176169 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Petitioner for Illegal Recruitment.

**Facts:** The Information charged Petitioner with illegal recruitment under RA 8042 for acts committed in January 1993. The RTC convicted based on prosecution evidence. The CA affirmed but modified, noting the alleged offense occurred before RA 8042 took effect and thus should be based on the Labor Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995):**  The original charge was based on this act. Key provisions relate to the definition and penalties for illegal recruitment (Sections 6 & 7).  Critical point: this law was not in effect at the time of the alleged crime.
*   **Labor Code (Art. 13(b), Art. 38, Art. 39):**  The CA correctly determined this was the applicable law.
    *   **Art. 13(b):** Defines "recruitment and placement."
    *   **Art. 38:** Defines illegal recruitment.
    *   **Art. 39:** Prescribes penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines. The court upheld the conviction based on these provisions.
*   **Elements of Illegal Recruitment (as per *People v. Señoron*):** (1) Undertaking recruitment activities; and (2) Lack of license or authority.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner was found guilty of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 4-5 years imprisonment.  The CA added a civil liability of P10,000 in temperate damages to Nila Panilag.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Erroneous Designation in the Information:** The Information cited RA 8042, a law not in effect at the time of the alleged crime. However, *Gabriel v. Court of Appeals* clarifies the nature of the charge is determined by the *facts* alleged in the Information, not the legal citation. The Court overlooked the error because the factual allegations supported a conviction under the Labor Code.  This could have been grounds for dismissal had the factual allegations not aligned with the elements of illegal recruitment under the applicable law.
*   **Ex Post Facto Law/Retroactivity:** Petitioner argued that applying RA 8042 (with its higher penalties) violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws. The court correctly rejected this, emphasizing that the conviction was ultimately under the *Labor Code*, which *was* in effect.
*   **Lack of Civil Damages (RTC):** The RTC initially declined to award civil damages due to "no substantial proof." The CA awarding temperate damages highlights that a finding of criminal liability can support a civil award even with limited specific evidence of damage.

**Case Law:**

*   **Gabriel v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 128474, 6 October 2004):**  Essential for the principle that the nature of the crime is defined by the *facts alleged* in the Information, not the incorrect designation of the law.
*   **United States v. Lim San (17 Phil. 273, 279 (1910)):** Affirms the focus should be on the acts performed, not the technical name of the crime.
*   **People v. Señoron (334 Phil. 932, 937-938 (1997)):** Outlines the two elements necessary to prove illegal recruitment.
*   **Benedicto v. Court of Appeals (416 Phil. 722, 748 (2001)):**  Defines "ex post facto law".

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8042:** Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995
*   **Labor Code of the Philippines:** Art. 13(b), Art. 38, Art. 39

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, focusing on the factual basis for a finding of guilt under the applicable Labor Code provisions, even though the initial Information cited the incorrect statute. The successful navigation of the erroneous citation and ex post facto arguments demonstrates the importance of pleading and proving the underlying facts of the offense.
