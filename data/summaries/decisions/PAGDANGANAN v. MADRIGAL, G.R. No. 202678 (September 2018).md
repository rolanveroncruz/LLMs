## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 202678

**Case:** *Ernestina A. Pagdanganan, et al. v. The Court of Appeals and Ma. Susana A.S. Madrigal, et al.*

**Nature:** Petition for Mandamus (initially)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for mandamus filed with the Supreme Court (SC) to compel the Court of Appeals (CA) to resolve a pending Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus (CA-G.R. SP No. 104291). The original CA petition challenged a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order authorizing a stockholders' meeting in Solid Guaranty, Inc. despite a pending interpleader suit concerning the company's shares.

**Key Provisions/Events:**

*   **Interpleader Suit (Civil Case No. 07-118329):** Filed by Solid Guaranty due to conflicting claims between the Madrigals and Citibank over shares of stock. This is the underlying cause of the dispute.
*   **Stockholders' Meeting:** The holding of a stockholders' meeting and the election of new directors and officers are at the center of the dispute.
*   **RTC Joint Order:** Authorized the stockholders' meeting to proceed to avert damage to the corporation and comply with capital requirements, as per Insurance Commission's circular.
*   **CA Petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 104291):** Petitioners sought to nullify the RTC's order, alleging grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Supplemental Petitions:** The filing of multiple supplemental petitions by the Petitioners in the CA caused delays in the resolution of the case. The CA ultimately expunged the Second and Third Supplemental Petitions.
*   **CA Decision:** During the pendency of the mandamus petition before the SC, the CA rendered a decision dismissing the original petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 104291) finding no grave abuse of discretion. The CA subsequently denied a Motion for Reconsideration.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty of the CA:** The primary obligation at issue was the CA's duty to provide a speedy disposition of the case.
*   **Solid Guaranty's Obligations:** Required to comply with the Insurance Commission's capital requirements.
*   **Potential Liability of RTC Judge:** Potentially liable for grave abuse of discretion if the authorization of the stockholders' meeting was improper. This liability was, however, dismissed by the CA's ruling.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Inordinate Delay:** Petitioners alleged inordinate delay by the CA in resolving the case.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Alleged against the RTC judge in allowing the stockholders' meeting.
*   **Mootness:** The primary risk identified is that the resolution of the underlying CA petition rendered the mandamus action moot.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65, Section 3:** Governing mandamus actions.
*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 16:** Guaranteeing the right to a speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Section 15(1):** Establishes timelines for court decisions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's Joint Order authorizing the shareholders' meeting contained language about averting prejudice to the operation of the corporation.

**Final Outcome & Analysis:**

The SC dismissed the petition for mandamus as moot because the CA had already resolved the underlying case. The SC also noted that the CA had not unduly delayed the case, considering the numerous filings by the petitioners.
