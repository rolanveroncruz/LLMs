## Legal Document Summary: Metropolitan Cebu Water District v. J. King and Sons Company, Inc.

**Citation:** G.R. No. 175983, April 16, 2009 (603 Phil. 471)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision nullifying the RTC orders and writ of possession issued in an expropriation case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD), a GOCC empowered to expropriate under P.D. No. 198, as amended.
*   **Respondent:** J. King and Sons Company, Inc., owner of the property being expropriated.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of the expropriation and issuance of the writ of possession. The CA held that the board resolution authorizing the filing of the expropriation complaint lacked exactitude and particularity which made it invalid; that there was no genuine necessity for the expropriation of the five (5)-square meter lot and; that the reliance on Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8974 in fixing the value of the property contravenes the judicial determination of just compensation.

**Facts:** MCWD sought to expropriate a 5-square-meter portion of respondent's land (covered by TCT No. 168605) for a production well. Negotiations failed, leading MCWD to file an expropriation complaint. MCWD deposited the BIR zonal value (P17,500.00) with the court and obtained a writ of possession. The CA reversed the RTC orders, prompting this petition.

**Ruling (Reversed CA):** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision. It ruled in favor of MCWD, reinstating the RTC's orders and the writ of possession.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Power of Eminent Domain:** MCWD has the delegated power of eminent domain under P.D. No. 198. This power is subject to the constitutional requirements of just compensation and due process (Art. III, Sec. 9, 1987 Constitution).
*   **Board Resolution and LWUA Approval:** The Court found that MCWD's board resolution (No. 015-2004) was sufficient authorization, and the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) reviewed and approved the expropriation. *Potential Challenge:* While the Court deems the resolution sufficient, future cases might scrutinize the specificity of board resolutions in expropriation proceedings.
*   **Applicability of R.A. No. 8974:** The Court holds that R.A. No. 8974 applies because the expropriation is for a national government project undertaken by a GOCC. This Act supersedes the deposit system under Rule 67 and mandates immediate payment based on zonal value.
*   **Writ of Possession Under R.A. No. 8974:** The Court clarifies that R.A. No. 8974 requires immediate payment (here, deposit with the court is considered equivalent to payment) of 100% of the zonal value to obtain a writ of possession. The amount of just compensation is to be determined in subsequent proceedings, and should be determined by the courts according to the standards set forth in Section 5 of R.A. No. 8974.
*   **Judicial Determination of Just Compensation:** Citing *Republic v. Gingoyon*, the Court reiterates that R.A. No. 8974 does not usurp the court's power to determine just compensation, but it does establish the zonal value as the minimum amount for immediate payment.
*   **Ministerial Duty to Issue Writ:** The Court concludes that the trial court had a ministerial duty to issue the writ of possession once MCWD complied with R.A. No. 8974's requirements.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **MCWD:** Obligated to remit the deposited amount (P17,500.00) to J. King. Liable for paying just compensation as determined by the RTC in subsequent proceedings.
*   **RTC:** Obligated to remit the amount to the Respondent and to require the sheriff to implement the writ of possession.
*   **J. King:** Obligated to relinquish possession of the 5-square-meter lot. Entitled to just compensation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Just Compensation Disputes:** The determination of just compensation remains a contentious issue. Litigation over the appropriate valuation is likely.
*   **Disturbance Compensation:** The determination of reasonable disturbance compensation for the removal and/or demolition of certain improvements on the land and for the value of improvements thereon.
*   **Small Area Issue:** While decided in MCWD's favour, the argument of the Respondent that the expropriated property is too small to be considered for public use may be raised again in future cases.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with MCWD, upholding its right to expropriate the property and obtain a writ of possession under R.A. No. 8974. The case underscores the GOCCs' power to exercise eminent domain for infrastructure projects and the importance of adhering to the statutory requirements for immediate payment. Further litigation will likely focus on the valuation of just compensation.
