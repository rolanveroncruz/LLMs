**Legal Document Summary: *National Transmission Corporation v. Spouses Manalo and Pedraja***

**Case:** G.R. No. 266921, January 22, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the RTC's order compelling TRANSCO to comply with RA 10752 (The Right-Of-Way Act).  The core issue is the applicable law for determining provisional compensation in an inverse condemnation case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 10752 vs. Rule 67 of Rules of Court:** The primary dispute centers on whether RA 10752 or Rule 67 governs the determination of provisional compensation. RA 10752 (Sec. 6) requires a deposit of 100% of the land's current BIR zonal valuation, while Rule 67 requires deposit of assessed value.
*   **TRANSCO's Obligation:** The RTC and CA ordered TRANSCO to deposit the amount equivalent to the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (BIR) current zonal valuation of the subject lots as provisional compensation per RA 10752.  The amount was ultimately adjusted by the RTC to PHP 70,288,500.00.
*   **Inverse Condemnation:** This case involves inverse condemnation, initiated by the landowners, due to TRANSCO's (or its predecessor NAPOCOR) construction of a 500-KV transmission line across their properties in 1998 without prior expropriation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Liability:** TRANSCO is potentially liable for the difference between the assessed value (under Rule 67) and the current zonal valuation (under RA 10752), a significantly higher amount.  Continued litigation could further increase costs.
*   **Retroactive Application of Law:** A key argument is whether RA 10752 can be applied retroactively, given the taking occurred before its enactment. The court relies on *Felisa Agricultural Corporation v. National Transmission Corporation, 834 Phil. 861 (2018)* for the determination of provisional value. This case holds that when inverse condemnation proceedings are initiated *after* the effectivity of RA 8974 (precursor to RA 10752), the law governs both procedurally and substantially, even if the taking occurred earlier.
*   **Factual Dispute:** The specific amount of provisional compensation (i.e., the affected area of the properties) remains a factual dispute, although the Court deferred to the findings of the lower courts on this matter.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 10752 (The Right-of-Way Act)**
*   **Republic Act No. 8974**
*   **Rule 67 of the Rules of Court**
*   ***Felisa Agricultural Corporation v. National Transmission Corporation, 834 Phil. 861 (2018)***: Key precedent cited by the court to support the application of RA 10752.
*   ***Republic v. Estate of Posadas III, 871 Phil. 612 (2020)***: TRANSCO incorrectly cited this case as this pertains to when an expropriation action was initiated prior to the taking of property and not inverse condemnation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Retroactivity:** TRANSCO's primary argument is that RA 10752 cannot be applied retroactively. However, the court rejects this argument by citing *Felisa* that RA 10752 applies when the landowner initiates inverse condemnation after RA 8974 and 10752 has come into effect.
*   **Provisional Compensation Value:** There is a factual dispute regarding the amount of land affected by the transmission lines and the corresponding provisional compensation. TRANSCO disputes the assessed area and thus, the final amount of provisional deposit that must be paid to the landowners.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied TRANSCO's petition, affirming the CA's decision. This means TRANSCO must comply with RA 10752 and deposit the amount equivalent to 100% of the BIR zonal valuation as provisional compensation. *Felisa* is the controlling precedent, as inverse condemnation was initiated *after* RA 10752 was in effect. A remaining challenge for TRANSCO is managing the factual dispute regarding land valuation and ensuring compliance with the provisional deposit requirement.
