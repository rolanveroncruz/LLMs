## Legal Document Summary: Ferrer v. Sandiganbayan

**Case:** *Dominador C. Ferrer, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 161067, March 14, 2008 (572 Phil. 244)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging Sandiganbayan Resolutions denying motions for re-determination of probable cause and to quash information.

**Key Issue:** Whether a finding of lack of administrative liability bars a subsequent criminal prosecution for the same acts.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner, Dominador C. Ferrer, Jr., former Administrator of Intramuros Administration (IA), was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for allegedly giving unwarranted benefits to Offshore Construction and Development Company by awarding lease contracts without public bidding and allowing construction without permits.
*   Prior to the criminal case, an administrative case was filed against him before the Presidential Commission Against Graft and Corruption (PCAGC) for the same acts. The Office of the President (OP) absolved him of administrative liability, finding he acted in good faith and within the scope of his authority.
*   Ferrer subsequently filed motions for reinvestigation, reconsideration, and to quash the information in the Sandiganbayan, all which were denied. He raised the dismissal of the administrative case as a ground, arguing it precluded the criminal prosecution.
*   The Sandiganbayan denied these motions, citing that the dismissal of the administrative case does not bar criminal prosecution.
*   Ferrer then filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed for being filed out of time and failure to pay required docket fees.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **denied** the petition for certiorari, holding that the dismissal of an administrative case does not bar a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts.

**Key Provisions and Legal Principles:**

*   **Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019:**  This is the specific anti-graft provision Ferrer is accused of violating. The Court did not delve into the specifics of the alleged violation but focused on the procedural issue.
*   **Independence of Administrative and Criminal Proceedings:**  The core principle is that administrative and criminal liabilities are separate and distinct.  An acquittal or dismissal in one does not automatically preclude the other. This principle is supported by *Paredes, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan*, *Tan v. Commission on Elections*, and *Valencia v. Sandiganbayan*.
*   **Res Judicata:** The ruling emphasizes that the resolutions on the administrative case do not have the effect of res judicata on the criminal case.
*   **Quantum of Proof:** The SC rejects the argument that because criminal cases require proof beyond reasonable doubt, the dismissal of an administrative case (requiring only substantial evidence) should necessarily lead to dismissal of the criminal case.
*   **Doctrine of Condonation:** The Court acknowledged but differentiated the concept of condonation in relation to administrative liability versus the possibility of extinguishment by reelection.
*   **Larin v. Executive Secretary:** Distinguished from the present case, the SC stated that the decision in Larin was based on specific facts where the basis of the administrative case conviction was overturned.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Ferrer remains criminally liable, notwithstanding the finding of no administrative liability.
*   The Sandiganbayan is obligated to proceed with the arraignment and trial of Criminal Case No. 26546.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidentiary Issues:**  The ruling largely sidesteps the factual issues underlying the alleged violation of R.A. 3019.  Ferrer's defense will likely hinge on disputing the elements of the crime, such as "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," or "gross inexcusable negligence."
*   **Delaying Tactics:** The Court expressly admonished Ferrer and his counsel against further delaying tactics.  Any further attempts to postpone the trial could be met with sanctions.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Paredes, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan, 322 Phil. 709 (1996):** Confirms that the dismissal of an administrative case does not necessarily bar the filing of a criminal prosecution for the same or similar acts.
*   **Tan v. Commission on Elections, 237 Phil. 353 (1994):** Reinforces the independent nature of administrative and criminal proceedings.
*   **Valencia v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 141336, June 29, 2004, 433 SCRA 88:**  Explains the differing bases of administrative and criminal liability.
*   **Larin v. Executive Secretary, 345 Phil. 962 (1997):** Distinguishes situations where an administrative case is dismissed following the reversal of a criminal conviction.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e):** The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act provision allegedly violated.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:**  Governs petitions for certiorari.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   There aren't clearly identifiable ambiguous or contentious clauses within this Supreme Court decision itself. The ambiguity and contentiousness lie in the arguments presented by Ferrer, specifically his reliance on the administrative dismissal to preclude the criminal prosecution, which the Court rejects.
