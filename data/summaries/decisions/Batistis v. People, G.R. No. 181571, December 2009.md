## Legal Document Summary: *Juno Batistis v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 181571

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmance of Juno Batistis's conviction for violation of Section 155 (infringement of trademark) of the Intellectual Property Code (RA 8293). The CA reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction on Section 168 (unfair competition) due to insufficient evidence. The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the CA's ruling on trademark infringement but modifies the penalty to comply with the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 155, Intellectual Property Code:** Prohibits unauthorized use in commerce of any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered trademark, or the same container, or a dominant feature thereof in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of goods or services, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception.
*   **Section 170, Intellectual Property Code:** Prescribes a penalty for infringement of trademark of imprisonment from two (2) to five (5) years and a fine ranging from P50,000 to P200,000.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Requires the imposition of an indeterminate sentence (minimum and maximum terms) for offenses punishable by the Revised Penal Code or special laws, except in certain enumerated instances (Section 2).

**Liabilities:**

*   Batistis is found liable for trademark infringement under Section 155 of the Intellectual Property Code. This is based on his manufacture, sale and distribution of counterfeit Fundador brandy.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Search Warrant Validity:** The legality of the search warrant (No. 01-2576) issued by Judge Antonio M. Eugenio, Jr. is not directly challenged on appeal but forms the basis for evidence presented. Counsel should examine the warrant's issuance and execution.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, including the confiscated materials (empty bottles, boxes, caps) and the test-buy conducted by NBI agents. Counsel should consider whether there are grounds to argue an alternative interpretation of the facts, considering the reversed conviction for unfair competition.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code):** Sections 155 (trademark infringement), 168 (unfair competition â€“ reversed by CA), and 170 (penalties).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103, as amended by Act No. 4225):** Mandatory application unless falling within exceptions specified in Section 2.
*   ***Spouses Bacar v. Judge de Guzman, Jr.* (A.M. No. RTJ-96-1349, April 18, 1997, 271 SCRA 328):**  Held that the imposition of an indeterminate sentence is mandatory, to prevent unnecessary deprivation of liberty and enhance economic usefulness of the accused.
*   ***Argoncillo v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 118806, July 10, 1998, 292 SCRA 313):** Applied the Indeterminate Sentence Law and found that a straight penalty to be erroneous, and modified it by imposing imprisonment ranging from 20 years, as minimum, to 25 years, as maximum.
*   ***People v. Nang Kay* (88 Phil. 515, 520 (1951)):** Presents an exception where the Indeterminate Sentence Law was not applied because it would have been unfavorable to the accused.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not necessarily ambiguous, the "colorable imitation" standard in Section 155 is a potential area for argumentation depending on the specifics of the imitation. The success of the prosecution's argument rested on evidence of "characteristics of counterfeiting."
*   The decision notes the "large number of Fundador articles confiscated" as justification for a heavier penalty under the Indeterminate Sentence Law. This could be challenged as disproportionate.

**Modified Penalty:**

*   Imprisonment ranging from two (2) years, as minimum, to three (3) years, as maximum.
*   Fine of P50,000.00.

**Next Steps:**

*   Examine the search warrant application and execution for potential violations of constitutional rights.
*   Analyze the evidence presented to determine if there are valid arguments to challenge the CA's finding of guilt based on the alleged "characteristics of counterfeiting."
*   Determine if any mitigating circumstances were overlooked that could warrant a lower minimum term under the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
