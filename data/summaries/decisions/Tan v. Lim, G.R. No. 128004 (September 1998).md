**Legal Document Summary: *Tan v. Lim*, G.R. No. 128004, Sept. 25, 1998 (357 Phil. 452)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the trial court's decision in Civil Case No. 6518 (Injunction and Damages) and Civil Case No. 6521 (Legal Redemption).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Marcelino Tan (lessee), Luz S. Briones, et al. (co-owners/lessors)
*   **Respondents:** Jose Renato Lim, Cynthia Go (purchasers), Adoracion Reyes, et al. (selling co-owners), Antonio Briones, et al. (selling co-owners)

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Legal Redemption (Civil Case No. 6521):**
    *   **Issue:** Whether co-owners (Luz Briones, et al.) could exercise their right of legal redemption under Article 1620 of the Civil Code after other co-owners (Adoracion Reyes, et al. and Antonio Briones, et al.) sold their pro-diviso shares to spouses Lim.
    *   **Holding:** No right of redemption because co-ownership had been terminated by a prior *oral partition*. The Court of Appeals (CA) found sufficient evidence of an oral partition and its consummation, evidenced by Flora Briones (co-owner)'s lease of a defined portion of the property (244 square meters, which is 1/2 of the 488 square meter property) to petitioner Marcelino Tan.  The actions of selling co-owners specifying the portion they sold suggests there was a prior partition.
    *   **Legal Analysis:** The court distinguished *Duque v. Domingo* (80 SCRA 654 (1997)) emphasizing that it was valid because the evidence supported it existed.. The court then referenced *Hernandez v. Andal* (78 Phil. 196, 203 [1947]) which states that equity can enforce oral partitions when completely or partly performed. The court also referred to Article 1356 and Article 1403 of the Civil Code.
    *   **Risk:** Validity of oral partition depends heavily on factual evidence of its execution/consummation. Lack of a written agreement doesn't necessarily invalidate it, but makes proof more difficult. The trial court's findings were weighed less than the court of appeals. Transfer Certificate of Title is not always indicative of actual ownership.

2.  **Injunction and Damages (Civil Case No. 6518):**
    *   **Issue:** Whether Marcelino Tan (lessee) was entitled to an injunction and damages for respondent Lim's alleged obstruction of access and demolition of improvements on the leased premises.
    *   **Holding:** No. (1) The CA correctly allowed consideration of evidence presented in Civil Case No. 6521 in Civil Case No. 6518 since both cases were jointly heard. The evidence included respondent Lim's testimony. (2) The CA said the trial court was too technical on submitting formal offer of evidence. (3) Tan's cause of action for *mandatory injunction* became moot and academic due to the expiration of the lease. Furthermore, Tan failed to prove easement rights to Ancheta Street, or damages for loss of construction materials.
    *   **Legal Analysis:** The court stated that an action for injunction must be considered moot when there is no existing lease from which right of possession results. The CA said that rules should be construed liberally to secure, not defeat, justice referencing Manila Railroad Co. vs. Attorney-general, (20 Phil. 523, 530 [1911]).
    *   **Risk:** The dismissal of the claim rested on the CA's liberal interpretation of procedural rules regarding the formal offer of evidence. The CA found that there was a lack of proper indemnification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Oral Partition:** The primary contentious point is the existence and validity of the oral partition. Without a written agreement, proving the terms and execution of the partition becomes highly fact-dependent and subject to conflicting interpretations.
*   **Formal Offer of Evidence:** The trial court's strict application of the rules regarding the formal offer of evidence, which was overturned by the CA. This highlights the potential for legal disputes arising from procedural technicalities.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1620:** Legal redemption by co-owners.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1356** Contracts are obligatory in whatever form they may have been entered into provided all essential requirements are present.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1403:** The limited instances when written proof of a contract is essential for enforceability.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 34:** Evidence not formally offered cannot be considered.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, Section 6** The rules should be construed liberally.
*   ***Hernandez v. Andal*** **(78 Phil. 196 (1947)):** Enforceability of oral partitions when fully or partly performed.
*   ***Duque v. Domingo*** **(80 SCRA 654 (1997)):** Improbability of oral partition based on lack of credible evidence.
*   ***Manila Railroad Co. vs. Attorney-general*** **(20 Phil. 523, 530 [1911])**: The purpose of procedure is not to thwart justice.

**Overall Assessment:**

The CA's decision, affirmed by the Supreme Court, hinged on the factual finding that an oral partition had occurred, effectively terminating the co-ownership and precluding the right of legal redemption. The decision also highlighted the importance of a liberal interpretation of procedural rules to achieve substantial justice. The key risk remains the inherent difficulty in proving the existence and terms of oral agreements, particularly partitions of real property.
