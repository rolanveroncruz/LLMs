**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Juan Peña*, G.R. No. 116022, July 1, 1998.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court modified the RTC decision convicting Juan Peña of Murder, reducing the conviction to Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code. Peña admitted stabbing Isidro Odiada (Barangay Captain) but claimed self-defense.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Original charge was Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, alleging treachery, evident premeditation, dwelling, and disregard of respect due to a public official.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Peña guilty of Murder, sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, and ordered him to pay damages (P87,000 actual, P50,000 death indemnity).
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed the Murder conviction, finding insufficient evidence of treachery and evident premeditation. The Court also rejected the aggravating circumstance of disregard for the victim’s rank.
*   **Self-Defense:** Peña's implicit claim of self-defense was rejected due to inconsistent testimonies and lack of unlawful aggression from the victim. See *People v. Boniao, 217 SCRA 653 [1993]*.
*   **Treachery:** Not proven due to a prior heated argument and victim having notice of threat. Cites *People v. Estrellanes, Jr., 239 SCRA 235, 249 [1994]*.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** Not proven; lacks evidence of manifest acts indicating adherence to a plan. Cites *People v. Narit, 197 SCRA 334, 349 [1991]*.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:** Voluntary Surrender was proven and considered.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Penalty:** Peña was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years of *prision mayor* as minimum, to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Actual damages reduced from P87,000 to P61,269.39 (based on presented receipts).
    *   Civil indemnity for death affirmed at P50,000 (consistent with prevailing jurisprudence). See *People v. Taneo, 218 SCRA 494, 510 [1993]*.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinges on the interpretation of the facts surrounding the stabbing. Conflicting testimonies presented challenges in establishing the sequence of events and the intent of the accused.
