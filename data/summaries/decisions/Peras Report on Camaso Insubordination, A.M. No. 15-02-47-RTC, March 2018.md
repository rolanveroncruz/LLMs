Okay, here's a legal summary of A.M. No. 15-02-47-RTC, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** Re: Report of Executive Judge Soliver C. Peras, Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (RTC), Branch 10, on the Acts of Insubordination of Utility Worker I Catalina Z. Camaso, Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC.

**Citation:** 828 Phil. 586 (2018)

**Issue:** Whether Catalina Z. Camaso (Camaso), a Utility Worker I, should be dropped from the rolls due to mental unfitness to perform her duties.

**Holding:** Yes. The Supreme Court adopted the OCA's recommendation to drop Camaso from the rolls without forfeiture of benefits, based on findings of mental unfitness.

**Facts:**

*   Executive Judge Peras filed a complaint against Camaso for gross insubordination, alleging failure to comply with a temporary detail memorandum and subsequent directives to explain the non-compliance.
*   Judge Peras also cited Camaso's "strange and abnormal" behavior.
*   The OCA recommended a neuro-psychiatric evaluation.
*   Dr. Banzon's report concluded Camaso suffered from Delusional Disorder, Mixed Type (Grandiose and Persecutory), impairing her interpersonal relationships and capacity to work.
*   Camaso argued lack of jurisdiction, claiming assignment to the RTC Library under the OCA's supervision and citing an administrative order preventing assignment outside her job description.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), Section 93:**  This is the statutory basis for dropping an employee from the rolls for physical or mental unfitness. Specifically, Section 93(c)(3) addresses employees exhibiting abnormal behavior and mental disorder confirmed by a physician.
*   **RRACCS, Section 96:** Emphasizes that the separation is non-disciplinary, preserving accrued benefits and eligibility for re-employment.
*   **Insubordination Allegation:** While the complaint originated with insubordination charges, the Court's ruling hinges solely on mental unfitness under RRACCS Sec. 93. The alleged insubordination became evidence of the unfitness.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The Court heavily relies on the psychologist's findings of deteriorated mental functioning and distorted perception and the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Delusional Disorder. This evidence was pivotal in establishing mental unfitness.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Due Process:**  While the Court emphasizes this is not disciplinary, the origin of the case in an insubordination complaint raises potential due process concerns. It's essential that Camaso was given adequate notice and opportunity to respond to the allegations of mental unfitness, separate from the original insubordination charge. The letter from the OCA and resolution from the court, requiring comment, would need to contain sufficent detail so as to not violate Due Process rights.
*   **Burden of Proof:** While not technically a disciplinary case, the employer (Judiciary) arguably bears the burden of demonstrating mental unfitness based on competent medical evidence. The medical evaluations appear sufficient, but the quality and objectivity of the initial observations by Judge Peras and Camaso's colleagues should be considered.
*   **Job Description Argument:** Camaso's argument about being assigned outside her job description and lacking jurisdiction was not addressed, because the finding of insubordination did not feature in the final decision.
*   **Accommodation:** The decision does not discuss whether the employer explored reasonable accommodations for Camaso's condition before resorting to separation.

**Case Law Considerations:**

*   This case establishes a precedent for using RRACCS Section 93 to remove employees with diagnosed mental disorders, even if the initial complaint was based on disciplinary grounds.
*   The weight given to medical evaluations emphasizes the importance of qualified medical professionals in determining mental fitness for duty.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dropping of Camaso from the rolls based on confirmed mental unfitness, relying heavily on medical evidence. While framed as a non-disciplinary action preserving benefits and re-employment eligibility, potential due process issues stemming from the initial insubordination complaint and the absence of discussion regarding accommodation warrant further consideration. The case underscores the significance of thorough medical evaluation and adherence to RRACCS Section 93 procedures in cases of alleged mental unfitness in the civil service.
