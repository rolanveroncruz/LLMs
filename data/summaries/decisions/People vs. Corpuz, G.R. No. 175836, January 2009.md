## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Corpuz* (G.R. No. 175836, January 30, 2009)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed with modification the Court of Appeals' decision finding Ruben Corpuz guilty of six counts of simple rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-B, Revised Penal Code (Rape):**  Defines the crime of rape and its penalties. This case focuses on simple rape given the nature of the allegations and the fact that the relationship element was not properly pled.
*   **Affirmative Defense:** Corpuz's "sweetheart" defense, requiring him to prove consensual sexual relations.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Liability:** Found guilty of six counts of simple rape, sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua for each count, and ordered to pay damages.
*   **Monetary Obligations:** The appellant is responsible for paying the victim (AAA) civil indemnity (P50,000 per count), moral damages (P50,000 per count), and exemplary damages (P25,000 per count).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** This was a central issue, ultimately decided against the defendant. Reliance on the 'sweetheart' defense failed due to lack of corroborating evidence beyond the defendant's own testimony.
*   **Relationship Element:** While the trial court initially considered the stepfather-stepdaughter relationship as an aggravating factor, this was overturned by the Court of Appeals and ultimately by the Supreme Court, as the Information incorrectly alleged the relationship.  The prosecution failed to prove a marriage existed between the accused and the victim's mother. Therefore, the crime qualified as "simple rape".
*   **Insufficient Pleading:** The failure to properly plead the relationship between the defendant and the victim affected the ultimate outcome.
*   **Force and Intimidation:** While the defendant claimed consensual sex, the court found the victim's testimony, supported by the social worker's report and the victim's age, credible enough to establish the element of force or intimidation (or moral ascendancy substituting for intimidation) necessary for rape.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code:** The foundational statute for the rape charge.
*   **People v. Adajio, 397 Phil. 354 (2000):** Relevant for the proposition that physical resistance is unnecessary where threats and intimidation are employed, as the victim's fear rendered her compliant.
*   **People v. Remudo, 416 Phil. 422 (2001):** Cites the concept of moral ascendancy substituting for violence or intimidation when the perpetrator is a close kin or someone who yields influence over the victim.
*   **Jurisprudence Regarding Damages:** The court cites case law regarding the proper amounts to be awarded for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in rape cases. Cases cited include: *People v. Baun, G.R. No. 167503, August 20, 2008; People v. Cacayan, G.R. No. 180499, July 9, 2008; People v. Codilan, G.R. No. 177144, July 23, 2008; People v. Salome, G.R. No. 169077, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 659; People v. Quiachon, G.R. No. 170236, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 704.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Allegation of "Stepfather" Relationship:**  The erroneous allegation of the stepfather-stepdaughter relationship in the Information, when the evidence showed only a common-law relationship with the mother, ultimately prevented the conviction for qualified rape.

**Conclusion:** The court heavily weighed witness credibility and the victim's testimony, finding the defendant guilty of six counts of simple rape. The defendant's "sweetheart" defense lacked supporting evidence. The improper pleading regarding the relationship between the defendant and the victim was a critical factor in the outcome, leading to a conviction for simple rather than qualified rape.
