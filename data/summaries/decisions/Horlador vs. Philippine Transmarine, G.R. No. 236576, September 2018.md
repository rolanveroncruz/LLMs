**Case:** *Ariel P. Horlador v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., et al.*, G.R. No. 236576, September 5, 2018.

**Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari regarding the award of attorney's fees in a seafarer's disability claim. The Supreme Court (SC) reinstated the award of attorney's fees to the petitioner, Ariel P. Horlador, after the Court of Appeals (CA) had deleted it. The SC held that since the petitioner was found entitled to permanent and total disability benefits, attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award are proper under prevailing jurisprudence in labor cases involving employeesâ€™ wages and benefits.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Employment:** Petitioner was hired as a Chief Cook for eight months starting June 19, 2012.
*   **Disability Claim:** Petitioner suffered a work-related injury (waist, abdomen, scrotum pain, later diagnosed as "infection with the need to rule out Epididymitis and Prostatitis" and Chronic Prostatitis) leading to a claim for permanent and total disability benefits.
*   **Post-Employment Medical Examination:** Petitioner claimed he was denied a post-employment medical examination by the respondents (PTCI, Marine).
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The central issue is the reinstatement of attorney's fees, which the SC ultimately granted.
*   **Monetary Award:** The NLRC initially awarded US$60,000.00 in disability benefits plus 10% attorney's fees; the CA affirmed the disability award but deleted the attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. (PTCI) & Marine Shipmanagement Ltd.:**  Liable for permanent and total disability benefits to the petitioner.
*   **Captain Marlon L. Malanao:** named as crewing manager, jointly and severally liable with PTCI and Marine.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Work-Relatedness:** The primary defense by the respondents was challenging the work-related nature of the illness and the absence of a medical repatriation. This was resolved against them by the NLRC and affirmed by the CA.
*   **Post-Employment Medical Examination:** The respondents claimed that the petitioner failed to comply with the mandatory post-deployment medical examination, while the petitioner argues he was ignored when he reported for examination.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The factual basis for the deletion of attorney's fees by the CA, which was that the NLRC failed to present a factual basis, was deemed erroneous by the SC, citing established jurisprudence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:**  Relates to when attorney's fees can be recovered. specifically, Article 2208 (8) relating to recovery of indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws and (11) any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.
*   **Jurisprudence on Attorney's Fees in Labor Cases:** *Tangga-an v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.*, 706 Phil. 339 (2013) & multiple other cases cited in the SC decision, establishes the 10% rule for attorney's fees when an employee prevails in a wage/benefit claim.
*   **Labor Code (Implied):** The entire case is predicated on the Labor Code provisions related to seafarers' rights and benefits, including disability compensation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

The key contention was centered on the award of attorney's fees, specifically whether there was a sufficient basis for the CA's decision to delete the attorney's fees awarded by the NLRC. The SC clarified that the prevailing doctrine mandates the award of 10% attorney's fees in successful labor claims, making the CA's deletion erroneous.
