## Legal Document Summary: People v. Saley (G.R. No. 121179)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting the accused, Antonine B. Saley, a.k.a. Annie B. Saley, on multiple counts of estafa (Art. 315, RPC) and illegal recruitment (Art. 38, Labor Code), including one count of illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Art. 38, Labor Code):** The Court affirmed the conviction for illegal recruitment, finding that Saley engaged in recruitment activities (canvassing, enlisting, contracting, etc.) without the necessary license or authority from the POEA.  The Court cites Article 13(b) of the Labor Code defining recruitment.
*   **Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale (Art. 39(a), Labor Code):** The Court upheld the conviction for illegal recruitment in large scale because Saley's actions affected three or more individuals.
*   **Estafa (Art. 315, RPC):**  The Court affirmed the conviction for estafa. The elements of deceit and resulting damage capable of pecuniary estimation were proven. The court applied the Indeterminate Sentence Law and adjusted the penalties based on the amounts defrauded in each case.
*   **Concurrent Offenses:** The Court explicitly states that conviction under the Labor Code for illegal recruitment does not bar prosecution and punishment for estafa, as the former is *malum prohibitum* and the latter *malum in se*. The court cited the case of People vs. Benemerito, 264 SCRA 677.
*   **Defense's Claim of Agency:**  The Court rejected Saley's defense that she was merely an agent or liaison officer for licensed travel agencies (Dynasty Travel and Tours, Mannings International). The Court noted the absence of evidence to support this claim (failure to present the alleged principals) and invoked the legal presumption that suppressed evidence would be adverse if produced.
*   **Affidavits of Desistance:** The trial court correctly disregarded the affidavits of desistance filed during trial and did not grant the “Motion to Reopen Trial.”

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Saley is criminally liable for:
    *   Multiple counts of illegal recruitment, each carrying a sentence of imprisonment of 4-6 years and a fine.
    *   One count of illegal recruitment in large scale, carrying a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.
    *   Multiple counts of estafa, with penalties adjusted based on the amount defrauded in each case, following the guidelines of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and People v. Gabres (267 SCRA 581).
*   **Civil Liability:** Saley is ordered to pay actual damages to the complainants, representing the amounts they were defrauded of, as well as costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The central dispute revolves around conflicting testimonies regarding the nature of Saley's involvement (recruiter vs. mere referrer). The Court clearly favors the prosecution's version, based on the weight of the evidence.
*   **Defense Strategy:** The defense's attempt to shift blame to the travel agencies and claim confiscation of exculpatory evidence (receipts) by CIS agents was unsuccessful, raising questions about the strength and credibility of the defense.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The defense did not raise the issue of double jeopardy, but the court addressed the possibility of a concurrent offense being committed and states that “Conviction for these various offenses under the Labor Code does not bar the punishment of the offender for estafa.”

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 13(b), 38, and 39. Defines recruitment, illegal recruitment, and penalties.
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Article 315. Defines and prescribes penalties for estafa.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103):** Governs the imposition of indeterminate sentences for offenses under special laws.
*   **People v. Benemerito (264 SCRA 677):** Addresses the relationship between illegal recruitment and estafa prosecutions.
*   **People vs. Gabres (267 SCRA 581):** Provides guidance on the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law in estafa cases.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision, finding Saley guilty of multiple counts of estafa and illegal recruitment. The Court adjusted the penalties in some estafa cases based on established legal principles and evidence presented. This document sets a precedent for prosecuting individuals engaged in unauthorized recruitment activities and affirms that defrauding job seekers constitutes a criminal offense, regardless of the perpetrator's claimed role. The case highlights the vulnerability of individuals seeking overseas employment and the importance of strict enforcement of recruitment regulations.
