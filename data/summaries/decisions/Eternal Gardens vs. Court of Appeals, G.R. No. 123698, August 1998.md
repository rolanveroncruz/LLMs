## Legal Document Summary: *Eternal Gardens Memorial Park Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Sps. Lilia Sevilla and Jose Seelin* (G.R. No. 123698, August 05, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the execution of a final judgment in a case for quieting of title (Civil Case No. C-9297, RTC Caloocan City). This is the *second* time Eternal Gardens has sought to prevent execution.

**Key Issue:** Whether Eternal Gardens, as transferee *pendente lite* of the property in dispute, is bound by the final judgment against its predecessor-in-interest, Central Dyeing & Finishing Corporation, and whether the writ of possession and execution was validly issued.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' dismissal of Eternal Gardens' petition for certiorari. The Court ruled that the issues raised by Eternal Gardens were res judicata, having been previously decided in CA-G.R. SP No. 28797 and G.R. No. 109076.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Binding Effect on Transferee *Pendente Lite*:** Eternal Gardens is bound by the judgment against Central Dyeing pursuant to Rule 3, Section 20 of the Revised Rules of Court (action can be continued against the original party and is binding on the transferee) and Rule 39, Section 48(b) of the Revised Rules of Court (judgment is binding on successor in interest).
*   **Writ of Possession:** The writ of possession was a necessary consequence of the judgment declaring Sps. Seelin the rightful owners. They are not required to file a separate action for possession.
*   **Enforcement of Writ:** The Sheriff executed the Alias Writ of Possession and Alias Writ of Execution, turning over possession to the Sps. Seelin.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Subterfuge to Delay Execution:** The Court expressly called out Eternal Gardens for employing dilatory tactics and warned against misusing rules of procedure to defeat the ends of justice, citing *Gomez vs. Presiding Judge, RTC, Br. 15, Ozamis City* (249 SCRA 438-439; October 24, 1995)
*   **Costs:**  The Court of Appeals previously considered assessing double costs against the petitioner. Although not explicitly imposed in this decision, the Supreme Court's strong language suggests a risk of future sanctions for similar conduct.
*   **Desecration of Graves:** While the Court acknowledged the concerns of burial lot owners, it noted that the trial court had considered their interests and suggested alternative remedies, like payment in cash for the property to avoid the demolition.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 3, Section 20, Revised Rules of Court:** Binding effect on transferee *pendente lite*.
*   **Rule 39, Section 48(b), Revised Rules of Court:** Judgments binding on successors-in-interest.
*   **Gomez vs. Presiding Judge, RTC, Br. 15, Ozamis City** (249 SCRA 438-439; October 24, 1995): End of litigation; prevents subterfuge.
*   **Banogan et. al. vs. Cerna, et. al.**, (154 SCRA 593, cited in Chua Huat, et. al. vs. Court of Appeals, et. al., 199 SCRA 15, July 9, 1991): Lawyers should not file pointless petitions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The order from the lower court allowing payment by Eternal Gardens to avoid demolition of grave sites is ambiguous as to whether it is mandating or merely suggesting such course of action.  This could lead to further disputes regarding compensation and the rights of the lot owners.
*   The court mentions Civil Case No. C-11337, where the Republic of the Philippines is seeking the nullification of Sps. Seelin's title, but determines the outcome of that case is irrelevant because Eternal Garden's chain of title was previously nullified in Civil Case C-9297. However, if C-11337 is successful in nullifying Sps. Seelin's title, that would impact who owns the property, and the implications of this are not completely dealt with in the decision.

**Potential Risks (for Eternal Gardens):**

*   Continued attempts to delay execution could result in sanctions and/or contempt of court.
*   Potential liability to lot owners if graves are disturbed during the execution of the writ of possession.

**Overall:** This case reinforces the principles of res judicata and the binding effect of judgments on transferees *pendente lite*. It also serves as a warning against using dilatory tactics to frustrate the execution of final judgments.
