**Case Summary: *Canlas v. Bongolan et al.*, G.R. No. 199625 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision affirming the Ombudsman's dismissal of an administrative complaint for grave misconduct and violation of R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3(g) filed by Jerome Canlas against Home Guaranty Corporation (HGC) officers.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Background:** The case stems from the sale of two lots within the Manila Harbour Centre, part of the Smokey Mountain Development and Reclamation Project, by HGC to Alfred Wong for P384,715,800.00 (P13,300.00/sqm). The project was financed through asset-backed securitization, with HGC acting as guarantor. When the asset pool defaulted, HGC acquired the assets and sold the lots to recover its exposure.
*   **Complaint:** Canlas, an officer of R-II Builders and Harbour Centre, alleged that the HGC officers sold the lots below fair market value, causing damage to the government. He cited comparables and an appraisal report. The HGC officers countered they followed the Revised Disposition Guidelines (Office Order No. 66), obtained a favorable opinion from the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel, and sold the properties above the zonal valuation.
*   **Ombudsman Decision:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaint, finding no proof the transaction was disadvantageous to the government and that HGC officers were not directly responsible, the Board of Directors was liable.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals affirmed, emphasizing the Board's approval, the publication of notices of sale, and the zonal valuation exceeding the sales price.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Petitioner's Standing:** Does Canlas have standing to file the administrative case and subsequently appeal the Ombudsman's decision? The Court ruled no. Canlas filed in his personal capacity and did not demonstrate any direct personal benefit or injury from the sale. While any person can initiate a complaint with the Ombudsman, the right to appeal an adverse decision is limited to parties directly affected.
2.  **Appealability of Ombudsman's Decision:** Is the Ombudsman's decision dismissing the complaint appealable? The Court ruled no. Based on Section 27 of R.A. No. 6770 and Rule III, Section 7 of Administrative Order No. 07, as amended, the exoneration of respondents by the Ombudsman renders the decision final and unappealable.
3.  **Reasonableness of the Purchase Price:** Was the purchase price unreasonably low? The Court upheld the lower courts' finding of reasonableness, citing the sale price exceeding the zonal valuation, minimum disposition values derived using prescribed methods, and the absence of other viable offers despite public notices. This was deemed a question of fact inappropriate for a Rule 45 petition, and the factual findings of the Ombudsman were binding due to substantial evidence.
4.  **Liability of HGC Officers:** Are the HGC officers the proper parties to charge with the offense? The Court agreed with the Ombudsman that ultimate responsbility for the sale was with the Board of Directors. The decision states the officers signed and acted in accordance with resolution and order issues by the Board of Directors.
5.  **Grave Misconduct:** Can the officers be administratively liable for grave misconduct? The Court ruled no. While officers cannot hide behind corporate veils, Canlas failed to prove the necessary element of bad faith or malice, required for a finding of grave misconduct.
6.  **Grossly Disadvantageous Contract:** Was the contract of sale grossly disadvantageous to the government under R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3(g)? The Court ruled no. While they may have made a mistake, or that there was a market dip, their sale was deemed by the Court to be exercising due diligence and sound business judgement.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutes:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3(g):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically the provision prohibiting contracts grossly disadvantageous to the government. *Froilan v. Sandiganbayan* (2000) sets out the elements.
*   **R.A. No. 6770:** The Ombudsman Act of 1989, particularly Section 27 regarding the finality of Ombudsman decisions. *Dagan v. Office of the Ombudsman* (2013) distinguishes between appealable and unappealable decisions.
*   **R.A. No. 8763:** Home Guaranty Corporation Act of 2000, outlining HGC's powers and functions.
*   **R.A. No. 10149:** GOCC Governance Act of 2011 - suppletory application.
*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 23:** Powers of the Board of Directors.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Sec. 2:** Defines "real party in interest."
*   *Bueno v. Office of the Ombudsman* (2014): Legal Standing, and the use of an anonymous party to file claim.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Fair Market Value Determination:** The dispute over the proper method for determining fair market value is central. The Court deferred to the lower courts' reliance on zonal valuation and minimum disposition values, but Canlas argued for using comparables and appraisals.
*   **"Grossly and Manifestly Disadvantageous":** The interpretation of this phrase in R.A. No. 3019, Sec. 3(g) is critical. The Court emphasized that mistake, bad faith, or the violation of a rule must be present, not merely a potentially unfavorable outcome.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **None for the HGC Officers:** The dismissal of the complaint and affirmation by the appellate courts effectively eliminate the risk of administrative or criminal liability for the respondents.
*   **For Private Complainant (Canlas):** Canlas runs the risk of R-II Builders and Harbour Centre being barred by res judicata from questioning the sale as an indirect contempt proceeding.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, effectively exonerating the HGC officers. The ruling underscores the importance of standing in administrative appeals, the finality of Ombudsman exonerations, and the burden of proving bad faith and gross disadvantage in R.A. No. 3019 violations. The Court also deferred to the business judgment rule in assessing the reasonableness of the sale.
