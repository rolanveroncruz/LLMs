## Legal Document Summary: *Keng Hua Paper Products Co. Inc. vs. Court of Appeals; Regional Trial Court of Manila, Br. 21; and Sea-Land Service, Inc.* (G.R. No. 116863, February 12, 1998)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a dispute over demurrage charges arising from a bill of lading contract.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Bill of Lading as Contract:**  Affirms that a bill of lading, even unsigned, constitutes a binding contract of carriage upon acceptance by the shipper and consignee. Cites *Magellan Mftg. Marketing Corp. vs. Court of Appeals* (201 SCRA 102) and *Ong Yiu vs. Court of Appeals* (91 SCRA 223).
*   **Consignee Liability:**  The bill of lading (specifically Section 17) holds both shipper and consignee liable for demurrage charges.
*   **Acceptance by Conduct:** Consignee's (Keng Hua's) prolonged inaction (6 months) after receiving the bill of lading, without objecting to its terms, constitutes implied acceptance.  This creates a presumption that the consignee agreed to the entries and stipulations in the bill of lading.
*   **Overshipment:**  Discrepancies between the quantity of goods in the letter of credit and the bill of lading do not invalidate the contract of carriage. The carrier is not responsible for verifying the accuracy of the shipment against the letter of credit. Consignee's recourse for overshipment is against the shipper, citing the "Shipperâ€™s Load And Count" arrangement.
*   **Demurrage as Compensation:** Affirms that demurrage is compensation for the delay or detention of a vessel, citing *The Apollon* (22 U.S. 362).

**Obligations:**

*   **Consignee (Keng Hua):** Obligated to pay demurrage charges due to its prolonged failure to discharge the cargo within the free time.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Consignee (Keng Hua):** Liable for the principal amount of demurrage charges.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The initial determination of demurrage amount was not fixed and subject to daily increase.
*   **Interest Rate:** The case deals with the proper interest rate on the demurrage claim. The court modified the lower court's decision, ruling that the 6% legal interest rate should be computed from the date of the RTC decision (September 28, 1990), not from the date of extrajudicial demand, due to the unliquidated nature of the claim until the court's determination.  A 12% interest rate applies from the finality of the judgment. Cites *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals* (234 SCRA 88) for rules on legal interest.
*   **Attorney's Fees:**  The award of attorney's fees was deleted because the trial court failed to provide specific reasons for its award in the decision's text, thus lacking justification. Cites *Francel Realty Corporation vs. Court of Appeals* (252 SCRA 127).

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Articles 1169, 1266, 2209

**Case Law References:**

*   *Magellan Mftg. Marketing Corp. vs. Court of Appeals* (201 SCRA 102)
*   *Ong Yiu vs. Court of Appeals* (91 SCRA 223)

**Key Takeaway:** This case reinforces the principle that a bill of lading serves as a binding contract upon acceptance, even if unsigned. It highlights the importance of promptly objecting to its terms and clarifies the respective liabilities of shippers, consignees, and carriers in international shipping. Furthermore, it clarifies the appropriate interest rate for unliquidated claims and the necessity of justifying awards for attorney's fees.
