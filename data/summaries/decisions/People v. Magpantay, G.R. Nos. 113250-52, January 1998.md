**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a conviction by the Regional Trial Court for three counts of rape against the accused-appellant Teotimo Magpantay, committed against his 15-year-old daughter, Ronalyn Magpantay.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Accused convicted of three counts of rape, penalized under relevant provisions of the Revised Penal Code (implicitly) for the crime of rape.
*   **Indemnification:** Accused ordered to indemnify the victim, Ronalyn Magpantay, the sum of P50,000.00 for each count of rape, totaling P150,000.00.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua for each count of rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Liable for the commission of rape with the imposable penalty and accessory penalties applicable to the sentence.
*   **Civil Liability:** Obligation to pay damages (indemnification) to the victim for the harm caused by the crime.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Affirmance of Conviction:** The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the lower court's decision, which will happen if this case were to be appealed..
*   **Evidence:** The conviction relied heavily on the testimony of the victim and corroborating evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Impliedly, provisions relating to the crime of rape.
*   **People vs. Dayson, 242 SCRA 124 [1995]:** Cited regarding the elements of alibi as a defense. This case is used to distinguish whether or not the defense raised by the accused-appellant could be appreciated as a legal alibi that would warrant an exoneration from the offense.
*   **People v. Ombrog, G.R. No. 104666, February 12, 1997:** Cited regarding the deference given to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **People vs. Caballes (199 SCRA 152 [1991]):** Case law on the credibility of rape victims, particularly emphasizing the unlikelihood of a woman fabricating such a charge, especially against a family member.
*   **People vs. Sanchez (250 SCRA 14 [1995]):** Reinforces the principle that a woman, especially a young one, would not falsely accuse someone of rape.
*   **People vs. Baquiran (20 SCRA 451 [1967]):** Explains that evidence to be believed must not only come from a credible witness but must also be credible in itself.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Defense of Alibi:** The defense of "alibi" was raised, but the Court rejected it as it was merely an excuse offered for exoneration from the offense rather than a legal alibi based on the principles established in the People vs. Dayson case.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The accused-appellant challenged the credibility of the victim's mother and the expert witness. The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the victim's straightforward, consistent demeanor.
*   **Alleged Motive for False Accusation:** The accused-appellant claimed his wife fabricated the rape charges due to his discovery of her infidelity. The Court rejected this theory as improbable and inconsistent with Filipino family values.
