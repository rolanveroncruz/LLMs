Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Lamberto Mariñas y Fernando v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 232891, July 23, 2018. (836 Phil. 1150)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the CA's affirmance of Petitioner's conviction for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs - Methamphetamine Hydrochloride/"Shabu").

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 11, Article II, R.A. 9165. Possession of 0.01 gram of "Shabu".
*   **Warrantless Arrest/Search & Seizure:** The Court grapples with the validity of the in flagrante delicto arrest and subsequent seizure of the drugs. The Court found that there was a lawful warrantless arrest and seizure.
*   **Chain of Custody Rule (Section 21, R.A. 9165):** The central issue revolves around the prosecution's compliance with the chain of custody requirements established by Section 21 of RA 9165 prior to its amendment by RA 10640. Specifically, the defense challenges that the police failed to mark the item at the place of arrest and further failed to produce an elected public official and DOJ representative during the inventory and photographing of the seized items.
*   **IRR of R.A. 9165:**  The Court considers the guidelines on the implementing rules and regulations of Section 21, specifically on the venue for marking in warrantless seizures.
*   **Three-Witness Rule:** At the time of the alleged offense, Section 21 required the presence of the accused or his representative and representatives from the media, the DOJ, *and* any elected public official during the inventory and photographing of seized drugs.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Lamberto Mariñas y Fernando.

**Reasoning/Key Legal Arguments:**

*   **Failure to Comply with Three-Witness Rule:** The Court finds that prosecution failed to justify the *absence* of a representative from the Department of Justice and an elected public official during the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs.
*   **Substantial Gap in Chain of Custody:** The absence of these witnesses constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody, casting doubt on the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti. This failure outweighs the presumption of regularity.
* **R.A. 10640 application:*** The court clarified that the old provisions of Section 21 apply because the alleged crime was committed before the amendment introduced by R.A. 10640.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the strict chain of custody requirements under Section 21 (prior to amendment) can lead to acquittals even in cases where the accused is clearly guilty, if the procedural requirements are not meticulously followed and properly justified.
*   **Reliance on Justifiable Grounds:** The case highlights the crucial importance of documenting and *proving* justifiable grounds for deviations from the prescribed procedures. Simply invoking the presumption of regularity is insufficient.
*   **Impact of *People v. Umipang*:**  The Court cites *People v. Umipang* to emphasize that deviations must be minor and explained by justifiable grounds. Gross disregard of procedural safeguards creates doubt about the integrity of the evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Umipang*, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012)
*   *People v. Relato*, 679 Phil. 268 (2012)
*   *People v. Hilario*, G.R. No. 210610, January 11, 2018.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. 9165, Section 11, Article II (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs)
