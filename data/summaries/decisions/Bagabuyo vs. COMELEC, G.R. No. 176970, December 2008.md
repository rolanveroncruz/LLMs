## Legal Document Summary: *Bagabuyo v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 176970 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for *certiorari*, prohibition, and mandamus challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 9371 (RA 9371), which reapportioned Cagayan de Oro City's legislative district from one to two, and COMELEC Resolution No. 7837 implementing it.

**Holding:** Petition dismissed. RA 9371 is constitutional as a valid legislative reapportionment and does not require a plebiscite.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9371:** Apportions Cagayan de Oro City into two legislative districts for the election of representatives to Congress and allocates representation in the Sangguniang Panglungsod.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 7837:** Implements RA 9371, defining district boundaries.

**Key Arguments & Analysis:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** RA 9371 effectively divides Cagayan de Oro City without a plebiscite, violating Section 10, Article X of the Constitution.  He also alleges unequal representation between the two districts.
*   **COMELEC's Argument:** RA 9371 is a valid legislative reapportionment under Section 5, Article VI of the Constitution, increasing representation in Congress. It does not create, divide, merge, abolish, or substantially alter the boundaries of a local government unit, thus no plebiscite is required.
*   **Court's Reasoning:** The Court distinguishes between legislative reapportionment (Article VI, Section 5) and division of local government units (Article X, Section 10). RA 9371 is deemed a legislative reapportionment, not a division of the city.  It does not alter Cagayan de Oro's territorial integrity or corporate existence. A plebiscite is only required for creation, division, merger, abolition, or substantial alteration of boundaries of *local government units* (provinces, cities, municipalities, barangays), which did not occur here. The Constitution does not require "mathematical exactitude" in population distribution between legislative districts.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Tobias v. Abalos:** Confirms that legislative reapportionment does not require a plebiscite.
*   **Macias v. COMELEC & Montejo v. COMELEC:** Equality of representation is a justiciable issue.
*   **Herrera v. COMELEC:**  Districting based on inhabitant number, not number of registered voters.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article VI, Section 5:** Apportionment of legislative districts.
*   **Constitution, Article X, Section 10:** Creation, division, merger, etc. of local government units requires a plebiscite.
*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Criteria for creation, division, merger, etc. of local government units.
*   **Republic Act No. 9371:** The law in question, reapportioning Cagayan de Oro City.
*   **Republic Act No. 6636:**  Determines the number of councilors for cities with more than one representative district.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Population Disparity:** The Court acknowledges a population disparity between the two districts but finds it constitutionally permissible.  Future challenges may arise if the disparity becomes significantly larger, raising questions about effective representation.
*   **Definition of "Substantial Alteration":** The ruling hinges on the distinction between reapportionment and "substantial alteration" of a local government unit. While the Court finds no substantial alteration here, future cases may require a more precise definition of this term, potentially creating ambiguity in borderline situations.
*   **Political vs. Legal Considerations:** The petitioner's argument implicitly questions the *political* fairness of the reapportionment. The Court explicitly refrains from addressing the wisdom of the policy choices made by the legislature, focusing solely on the *legal* requirements. This highlights the limitations of judicial review in matters of political apportionment.
