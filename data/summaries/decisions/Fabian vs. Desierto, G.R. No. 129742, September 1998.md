Okay, here's a legal summary of Fabian vs. Desierto, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** Fabian vs. Desierto, G.R. No. 129742, September 16, 1998.

**Nature:** Appeal by Certiorari (initially) regarding an administrative disciplinary case decision by the Ombudsman.

**Facts:**
*   Teresita Fabian (petitioner), owner of PROMAT Construction, filed an administrative case against Nestor Agustin (private respondent), a DPWH official, for grave misconduct stemming from an alleged amorous relationship and abuse of official position.
*   The Ombudsman initially found Agustin guilty of misconduct, but this was reversed on reconsideration, exonerating Agustin.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Section 27 of RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989):**  Purports to grant the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction over administrative disciplinary cases from the Ombudsman via certiorari (Rule 45). The core issue is whether this provision is constitutional.
*   **Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman):**  States that Ombudsman decisions absolving respondents in administrative cases are final and unappealable.  This rule is in conflict with RA 6770.
*   **Constitutionality of Section 27, RA 6770:**  The Court *motu proprio* raised the issue of whether Section 27 violates Section 30, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, which requires the Supreme Court's advice and consent for any law increasing its appellate jurisdiction.
*   **Nature of Appellate Review:** The Court examines whether a review of Ombudsman decisions under RA 6770 is substantive (creating a new right of appeal) or procedural (merely changing the appellate route).

**Holding:**

*   **Section 27 of RA 6770 declared INVALID and UNCONSTITUTIONAL.** The Court held that it improperly expanded the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction without the Court's consent as required by the Constitution.
*   **Appeals from Ombudsman administrative cases should be taken to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43.**
*   **Section 7, Rule III of Administrative Order No. 07 is also invalid.**

**Reasoning:**

*   The Constitutional provision, Section 5(2)(e), Article VIII which gives the Supreme Court power to review, revise, reverse, modify, or affirm on appeal or certiorari the aforesaid final judgement or orders "as the law or the Rules of Court may provide," pertains to "final judgements and orders of lower courts," that is, the courts composing the integrated judicial system and not quasi-judicial bodies or agencies.
*   Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure now provides a uniform procedure for appeals from quasi-judicial agencies, including the Ombudsman, to the Court of Appeals.
*   Transferring the review function to the CA is deemed procedural, not substantive, as the right to appeal itself is preserved, only the forum is changed.
*   Legislative history showed the Senate was aware that the act expanded the Supreme Court's jurisdiction yet no advice or consent was sought from the Court.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Retroactive Application:**  The ruling potentially affects all pending appeals from the Ombudsman's administrative decisions that are currently before the Supreme Court.
*   **Procedural Shift:**  Litigants must now be aware that the proper forum for appeal in such cases is the Court of Appeals.
*   **Finality of Ombudsman Decisions:** Decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman, when appealed, are not final until the Court of Appeals adjudicates the case.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), Section 27:**  (Unconstitutional provision)
*   **Administrative Order No. 07 (Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman), Section 7, Rule III:** (Invalidated)
*   **Section 30, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution:**  (Requirement for Supreme Court advice and consent)
*   **Rule 43, Rules of Civil Procedure:** (Correct procedure for appeals from quasi-judicial agencies)
*   **First Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. vs. The Court of Appeals , et al. (G.R. No. 110571, October 7, 1994, 237 SCRA 519):** (Referenced regarding the Court's need to control its appellate jurisdiction.)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court specifically addressed certain "obiter statements" in *Yabut vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al.* and *Alba vs. Nitorreda, et al.* that could bear reexamination and clarification in future adjudications. This implies that certain aspects of the law regarding appeals from quasi-judicial bodies may still be evolving.
*The decision is in itself contentious, since four justices did not fully concur with the outcome.

**Note:** This is a summary. A lawyer would need to review the full text of the decision and relevant laws for comprehensive legal advice.
