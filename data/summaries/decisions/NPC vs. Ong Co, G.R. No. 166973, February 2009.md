Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *National Power Corporation (NPC) vs. Benjamin Ong Co* (G.R. No. 166973, February 10, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Eminent domain proceeding initiated by NPC to acquire an easement of right-of-way for power transmission lines on respondent's property.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Power of Eminent Domain:** NPC has the power of eminent domain under R.A. No. 6395, as amended.
*   **Just Compensation:** The central issue is the determination of just compensation for the expropriated property.
*   **Applicability of R.A. No. 8974:** The Court held that R.A. No. 8974 (facilitating right-of-way acquisition for national government infrastructure projects) applies because the Lahar Project is a national government project.  *Republic v. Gingoyon* (G.R. No. 166429, December 19, 2005) is cited, emphasizing R.A. No. 8974 supersedes Rule 67 on procedural aspects.
*   **Full Market Value vs. Easement Fee:** The Court rejected the 10% easement fee limitation stipulated in Sec. 3A of R.A. No. 6395. Instead, NPC is liable for the full fair market value because the transmission lines significantly restrict the respondent's use of the property. The case cites *National Power Corporation v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 150936, August 18, 2004) as precedent.
*   **Reckoning Date:** The Court ruled that just compensation should be determined as of **June 27, 2001**, the date NPC filed the expropriation complaint, in accordance with Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.  Exceptions to this rule are noted, but deemed inapplicable.  *B.H. Berkenkotter & Co. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 89980, December 14, 1992) is cited.
*   **Judicial Function:** Determination of just compensation is a judicial function, despite initial determinations made by the executive or legislature. *Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay* (233 Phil. 313 (1987)) and *National Power Corporation v. Purefoods* (G.R. No. 160725, 12 September 2008) are cited.

**Liabilities:**

*   NPC is liable to pay the full fair market value of the property.
*   NPC is subject to interest at 6% per annum from the date of taking (April 15, 2002) until full payment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** The conflicting appraisal reports of the initial commissioners necessitate the appointment of a new set of commissioners.
*   **Application of Sec. 5, R.A. No. 8974:** The RTC is instructed to apply the standards in Section 5 of R.A. No. 8974 in determining just compensation. This introduces some ambiguity as it requires factual assessment using multiple factors (classification and use of the property, developmental costs, selling price of similar lands, etc.).

**Disposition:**

*   Petition partially GRANTED.
*   CA decision AFFIRMED regarding the payment of full market value.
*   CA decision REVERSED regarding the reckoning date for valuation (date of taking).
*   Case REMANDED to the RTC for appointment of new commissioners and determination of just compensation consistent with the ruling.
