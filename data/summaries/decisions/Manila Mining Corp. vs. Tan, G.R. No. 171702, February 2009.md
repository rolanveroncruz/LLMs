**Legal Document Summary: Manila Mining Corporation vs. Miguel Tan, G.R. No. 171702**

**Case Overview:** Manila Mining Corporation (MMC) appeals the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling in favor of Miguel Tan, who is doing business as Manila Mandarin Marketing. Tan sued MMC for collection of unpaid balance for electrical materials delivered.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Sale of Goods:** Tan sold and delivered electrical materials to MMC between August and November 1997, totaling P2,347,880.
*   **Payment Terms:** MMC agreed to pay within 30 days, with 18% per annum interest for late payment and 25% attorney's fees for collection suits.
*   **Partial Payment:** MMC made partial payments of P464,636, leaving a balance of P1,883,244.
*   **Collection Suit:** Tan filed suit in 2001 to recover the unpaid balance.
*   **MMC's Defense:** MMC argued Tan failed to comply with purchase order requirements, specifically, submitting original invoices and purchase orders to the accounting department and invoked Art. 1545 of the Civil Code, claiming that the purchase orders were not properly received. It also alleged failure to provide the originals of purchase orders. They further alleged that Tan delayed the filling of the suit, thus are guilty of laches.

**Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Ruled for Tan, ordering MMC to pay the principal amount, plus 18% per annum interest from 30 days after each delivery date, and 25% attorney's fees as liquidated damages, and 12% upon finality.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC's decision.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the CA's decision, finding no merit in MMC's petition. It considered the arguments as raising factual issues already settled by the lower courts.

**Obligations:**

*   **MMC's Obligation:** To pay the outstanding balance for the delivered electrical materials, including interest and attorney's fees, as per the agreement implied in the purchase orders and invoices and formalized as a sales contract. Article 1475 of the Civil Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MMC's Liability:** MMC is liable for the principal amount, accrued interest (18% per annum until finality, then 12% per annum), and attorney's fees (25% of the principal amount).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** MMC faces the risk of having its assets attached to satisfy the judgment.
*   **Continued Accrual of Interest:** Interest continues to accrue on the outstanding balance until the judgment is fully satisfied.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1475:** Contract of sale is perfected upon meeting of minds on object and price.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1545:** Condition which is not performed, such party may refuse to proceed with the contract or he may waive performance of the condition.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 3 (Best Evidence Rule):** MMC argued for the application of the Best Evidence Rule. The Court held this only applies when the content of the writing is at issue.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 3(e):** MMC argued that by Tan's failure to yield the original documents, he was presumed to have suppressed evidence.
*   **Doctrine of Laches:** MMC alleged that Tan was guilty of delay in filing the suit. The Court rejected this argument as Tan filed the suit less than a year after MMC stopped making payments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   MMC argued that the purchase orders and invoices were merely offers and were not accepted. The Court rejected this argument.
*   MMC argued that the condition of presenting the original invoices and purchase orders was not met. The Court rejected this argument.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

The case presents a straightforward contract dispute. MMC failed to establish a valid defense against its obligation to pay for the goods received. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' factual findings that a contract of sale was perfected and that Tan sufficiently proved his claim. MMC's reliance on the "Best Evidence Rule" and the claim of suppressed evidence were unsuccessful because the contents of the documents were not in dispute and the Court found no ill intent by Tan. MMC's argument of laches also failed as Tan brought suit relatively soon after MMC stopped payments.
