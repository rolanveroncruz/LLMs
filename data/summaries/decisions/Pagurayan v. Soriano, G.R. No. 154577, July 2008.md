**Case Summary: *El Cid Pagurayan, et al. vs. Dolores Soriano-Caranguian, et al.* G.R. No. 154577, July 23, 2008**

**Facts:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari. The case involves a dispute over the validity of a writ of demolition issued against petitioners (tenants/occupants) after the land they occupied was acquired by respondent Reyes through an execution sale following a judgment against the original owners, the Sorianos.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Execution Sale & Redemption Rights:** Respondent Reyes purchased the Sorianos' property at a public auction to satisfy a judgment. The Sorianos failed to exercise their right of redemption, resulting in a deed of absolute sale to Reyes.
*   **Writ of Possession & Demolition:** Reyes obtained a writ of possession and subsequently a writ of demolition against the occupants (petitioners). The RTC resolution commanded the lessees of the subject lots to pay their rentals to him.
*   **Alleged Lessor-Lessee Relationship:** Petitioners claimed they became lessees of Reyes by paying rent to him after he acquired the property, arguing this created a new lease agreement independent of their previous relationship with the Sorianos. They base this claim on the receipt of rentals by Reyes and a letter from Reyes' counsel directing them to pay rent to Reyes as lawful owner.
*   **Rule 39, Section 34 (Old Rules of Court):** Respondent Reyes relied on this provision to justify his entitlement to rentals as the purchaser in the execution sale.
*   **Reyes' Position:** Reyes argued that his acceptance of rent did not create a contract of lease and that he was merely exercising his right as the owner.
*   **Contract of Lease Elements:** The court reiterates that a lease requires meeting of the minds, consideration (rent), and an agreement to temporarily grant the use of property. *Cites Chua Tee Dee v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 135721, 27 May 2004, 429 SCRA 418, 434, citing Lim Si v. Lim, 98 Phil. 868, 870 (1956).*

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Risk of Eviction:** Petitioners face eviction as they are deemed successors-in-interest to the Sorianos' rights.
*   **No Contractual Relationship:** The court found no express agreement demonstrating intent to create a lease between Reyes and the petitioners.
*   **Failure to Establish Lease Agreement:** The petitioners' primary risk is the inability to establish a valid lease agreement with Reyes, despite paying rent, which ultimately leads to an affirmation of the writ of demolition against them.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 34 (Old Rules of Court) [Now Section 32]:** Cited by Reyes to justify receiving rent. This is critical as it undermines the tenants' claim of a new lease agreement.
*   **Malonzo v. Mariano, G.R. No. 53998, 31 May 1989, 173 SCRA 667, 673-674:** Supports the argument that the writs against the Sorianos are enforceable against their lessees (the petitioners).
*   **Chua Tee Dee v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 135721, 27 May 2004, 429 SCRA 418, 434:** Reinforces the elements necessary for a contract of lease to be valid.
*   **Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila v. CA, G.R. No. 123321, 3 March 1997, 269 SCRA 145, 153:** Used to dismiss the argument of the petitioners that they should be covered under RA 7279 (or the Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Rent Payments:** The central contention revolves around whether Reyes' acceptance of rent automatically created a landlord-tenant relationship, a point disputed by Reyes who claimed he was merely exercising his right as the property owner.
*   **The October 26, 1994 Letter** The fact that petitioners were asked to pay Reyes rent could be seen as an acknowledgement of tenancy, but the Court ultimately sees this as Reyes enforcing his right as the new owner.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision denying the petition. It ruled that the petitioners failed to prove the existence of a valid lease agreement with respondent Reyes. The acceptance of rent alone did not create a lease, and Reyes was entitled to receive rent as the property owner. Consequently, the writ of demolition was deemed enforceable against the petitioners as successors-in-interest of the Sorianos. The Court also refused to apply RA 7279 because it was a new argument.
