**Legal Document Summary: PGMC v. AAA (G.R. No. 201292)**

**Case Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of PGMC's petition for certiorari. The core issue is the validity of a RTC order compelling PGMC to directly remit 50% of a retired military personnel's (BBB) pension to his estranged wife (AAA) as support, pursuant to a Permanent Protection Order under RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RTC Judgment & PPO:** Requires PGMC to withhold 50% of BBB's pension and remit it directly to AAA as support. Also orders payment of support in arrears.
*   **RA 9262, Sec. 8(g):**  Authorizes courts to order employers (including government entities like PGMC) to withhold a percentage of an employee's income/salary for direct remittance to a woman entitled to support, "notwithstanding other laws to the contrary."
*   **PGMC's Obligation:** Legally obligated to comply with the court order and withhold/remit pension funds as per RA 9262.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Indirect Contempt:** Failure to remit and/or withhold or any delay in the remittance of support to the woman and/or her child without justifiable cause shall render the respondent or his employer liable for indirect contempt of court.
*   **Potential Liability for Arrears & Interest:** The case is remanded to the lower court to determine the support arrearages and the applicable interest.
*   **Risk of Future Orders:** The ruling reinforces the principle that PGMC is subject to court orders requiring direct remittance of pension funds for support under RA 9262.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act):** The primary basis for the court's authority to order the withholding and direct remittance of pension funds.
*   **Republic v. Yahon, 738 Phil. 397 (2014):**  Controlling precedent directly addressing this issue with the same petitioner (PGMC). Held that RA 9262 creates an exception to the general rule of exemption of retirement benefits from execution.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1638 & R.A. No. 8291:**  Cited by PGMC as statutes exempting retirement benefits from attachment/garnishment. The court held that RA 9262, as a later and more specific law, prevails.
*   **Garcia v. Drilon:** Affirmed the constitutionality of RA 9262.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Employer" in RA 9262:** PGMC initially argued that it should not be considered an "employer" under RA 9262. The Court, however, construed the term broadly to include government entities.

**Potential Issues & Considerations:**

*   **Enforcement:**  The case is remanded for execution. It is critical to verify the current amounts due, including arrears and any applicable interest.
*   **Future Compliance:** PGMC must establish protocols for complying with similar court orders in the future, given the binding precedent set by *Republic v. Yahon* and this case.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA and RTC decisions, solidifying that PGMC can be compelled to directly remit pension funds for support under RA 9262. PGMC's arguments based on pension benefit exemptions were rejected. The key takeaway is the supremacy of RA 9262 in cases involving spousal/child support and violence against women.
