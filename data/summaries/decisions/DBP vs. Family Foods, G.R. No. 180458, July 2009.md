**Case Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Family Foods Manufacturing Co. Ltd., and Spouses Julianco and Catalina Centeno* (G.R. NO. 180458, July 30, 2009)**

**Core Issue:** Validity of stipulated interest rates and penalty charges in loan agreements and the CA's modification of the RTC decision *sua sponte* regarding those rates.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loans:** Two loans granted by DBP to Family Foods:
    *   P500,000.00 industrial loan (1982): 18% interest p.a., 8% penalty charge p.a. Secured by real estate and chattel mortgage.
    *   P440,000.00 additional loan (1984): 22% interest p.a., 8% penalty charge p.a. Secured by same mortgages.
*   **Mortgages:** Real estate and chattel mortgages executed by the Spouses Centeno in favor of DBP as security for the loans.
*   **Foreclosure:** Extrajudicial foreclosure initiated by DBP due to Family Foods' failure to pay. DBP emerged as the highest bidder at the auction sale and consolidated title after the redemption period lapsed.
*   **Lease Agreement:** Prior to consolidation, a lease agreement was entered into between Family Foods and DBP, acknowledging DBP's ownership (potential estoppel issue).

**Obligations:**

*   Family Foods: Obligation to repay the loans according to the terms of the promissory notes, including principal, interest, and penalties.
*   DBP: Obligation to comply with the requirements for valid extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135.

**Liabilities:**

*   Family Foods: Potential liability for the full amount of the loans, including stipulated interest and penalties, subject to defenses and counterclaims.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Rates and Penalties:**
    *   The CA reduced the interest rates (18% and 22%) to 12% and the penalty charge to 3%.
    *   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the CA erred in ruling on the validity of the stipulated interest rates and penalty charges because the respondents never raised it in the lower court.
    *   **Rationale:** Issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally barred by estoppel. The SC held the stipulated rates of interest not unconscionable, citing *Garcia v. Court of Appeals* (167 SCRA 815) and *Bautista v. Pilar Development Corporation* (371 Phil. 533). The penalty was likewise valid, citing *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Go* (G.R. No. 168779, September 14, 2007, 533 SCRA 460).
*   **Validity of Foreclosure:**
    *   Respondents contested the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure, claiming the notice of sale was not published in a newspaper of general circulation as required by law, citing Act No. 3135.
    *    They also assailed the form of the Sheriff's certificate of posting.
    *   **RTC & CA Ruling:** Ruled in favor of validity, CA Ruling was affirmed by SC.
*   **Estoppel:** DBP argued that Family Foods was estopped from questioning the foreclosure due to the lease agreement entered into by the parties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Governs the procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure. Key issues relate to notice requirements (publication in a newspaper of general circulation).
*   **Civil Code Articles:** Article 24 (protection for parties at a disadvantage).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (procedure for petition for review on certiorari), specifically Section 4 (contents of petition, dismissed on non-compliance in some instances) and Section 6 of Rule 1 (liberal construction of rules of court to ensure the just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly identified in the provided text, but the validity of the foreclosure proceedings was contentious.

**Potential Actionable Wrong:** It was DBP's position that Familys Foods had no justifiable legal argument for questioning the foreclosure of the loans, due to a lack of legal support, and due to issues raised on appeal, when they had not been raised in the lower courts.
