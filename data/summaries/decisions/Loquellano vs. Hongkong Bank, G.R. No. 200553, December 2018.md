**Case Summary: Spouses Loquellano v. HSBC et al. (G.R. No. 200553)**

**Legal Issue:** Validity of extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation-Staff Retirement Plan (HSBC-SRP) due to alleged default on a housing loan.  Entitlement to damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Spouses (Petitioners) mortgaged their property to HSBC-SRP (Respondent) to secure a housing loan.  Promissory Note executed.
*   **Loan Terms:** P400,000.00 loan payable in 25 years at 6% per annum via salary deduction. Loan secured by retirement benefits and chattel mortgage.
*   **HSBC-SRP Rules:**  Rules of the HSBC-SRP stated that termination of employment prior to full repayment of the loan made the entire outstanding balance due and demandable. This was the core of the legal dispute.
*   **Payment Obligation:**  Petitioners defaulted after Rosalina's (Petitioner) termination of employment.  The dispute centers around whether subsequent payments made and accepted by the bank constituted a waiver of the default.

**Timeline of Relevant Events:**

*   1988:  Rosalina obtained housing loan.
*   1993: Rosalina terminated. Loan payments ceased.
*   1994: HSBC-SRP demands full payment. Partial payment offer rejected.
*   1995: Rosalina resumes payments, accepted by the bank.
*   1996: Foreclosure initiated.
*   2016: Previous labor dispute between bank and union ruled upon by the Supreme Court ( *The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Employees Union, et al. v. NLRC, et al., 776 Phil. 14 (2016)*), declaring the strike illegal but finding illegal dismissal of employees, including Petitioner Rosalina, entitling her to backwages and separation pay.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **RTC Decision:** Initially favored Petitioners, annulling the foreclosure sale and awarding moral damages (P2M), exemplary damages (P500K), and attorney's fees (P100K) against HSBC, HSBC-SRP, and Manuel Estacion, jointly and severally.  Basis:  HSBC-SRP's rules were not made known to petitioners during the execution of the contract. RTC found respondents liable for damages under Article 19 and 20 of the Civil Code.
*   **CA Decision:** Reversed the RTC decision, upholding the validity of the foreclosure. Basis: Petitioner Rosalina agreed to abide by SRP rules when availing the loan and Rosalina defaulted on the payment when terminated from employment.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the CA, finding the foreclosure invalid based on estoppel. SC found respondent liable for damages under Articles 1431 and 1235 of the Civil Code.  Awards moral damages (P100K), exemplary damages (P30K), and attorney's fees (P100K) against HSBC-SRP *only*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Integration Clause/Disclosure:**  Absence of a clear integration clause in the mortgage contract incorporating the HSBC-SRP rules created ambiguity. Whether Petitioner Rosalina was adequately informed of, and agreed to, the acceleration clause upon termination is a critical point. The success of this case depended on the court’s determination if the petitioner was aware of the conditions under the HSBC-SRP rules. The document indicates that the court determined she was not.
*   **Waiver/Estoppel:** The acceptance of payments by the bank after the alleged default creates a strong argument for waiver or estoppel (Art. 1431, Civil Code; Sec. 2(a), Rule 131, Rules of Court; Art. 1235, Civil Code) preventing the foreclosure. *Pagsibigan v. Court of Appeals, 293 Phil. 205, 211 (1993).*
*   **Damages:**  The substantial reduction in damages by the Supreme Court highlights the difficulty in proving the extent of the injury.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The RTC erroneously imposed solidary liability on HSBC and Estacion, as HSBC was not a party to the mortgage, and Estacion acted within his authority. This was corrected by the Supreme Court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:**  Articles 19, 20, 1235, 1431, 2217, 2229. Articles 19 and 20 pertaining to general obligations to act in good faith and liability for damages due to negligence.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 131, Section 2(a) (conclusive presumptions – estoppel).
* *The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Employees Union, et al. v. NLRC, et al., 776 Phil. 14 (2016).*
*   *Pagsibigan v. Court of Appeals, 293 Phil. 205, 211 (1993).*

**Overall Assessment:**

The case highlights the importance of clearly drafted contracts, including the explicit incorporation of referenced documents (like the HSBC-SRP rules). The court emphasized equitable considerations and applied the doctrine of estoppel due to the bank's acceptance of payments, ultimately favoring the mortgagors. The SC decision underscores that a creditor's actions can constitute a waiver of contractual rights, especially when those actions lead the debtor to believe a different course of action is being followed.
