**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Pacifico Sangcajo, Jr., G.R. No. 229204, September 5, 2018

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and acquitted Pacifico Sangcajo, Jr. of rape due to reasonable doubt. The RTC and CA had previously convicted him based on the complainant's testimony.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Pacifico was charged with rape under the Revised Penal Code. The information alleged that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant (AAA) through force and intimidation after a drinking spree.
*   **Complainant's Testimony:** AAA testified that after drinking with Pacifico, she felt dizzy and slept on his "papag." She awoke to find him on top of her, forcibly removing her clothes and penetrating her. She claimed to have lost consciousness during the act.
*   **Accused's Defense:** Pacifico denied the charge, claiming the sexual intercourse was consensual.
*   **Medico-Legal Report:** An initial medico-legal report indicated "fresh healing deep laceration of the hymen at eight o'clock position" and "findings are compatible with recent vaginal penetration."
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC convicted Pacifico, finding AAA credible. The CA affirmed, adding moral and exemplary damages.

**Obligations:**

*   **State's Obligation:** To prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, relying on the strength of its evidence, not on the weakness of the defense.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Originally:** Pacifico was sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua. The lower court also ordered him to indemnify the private complainant [AAA].

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Testimony:** The Supreme Court found the complainant's testimony improbable. Specifically, the physical impossibility of removing clothing while allegedly holding her hands and pinning her legs.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The medico-legal report did not detail any injuries consistent with the level of force AAA described.
*   **Consensual Sex Defense:** The SC found it reasonable to believe that the sexual intercourse was consensual.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The SC emphasized the presumption of innocence and the state's burden to overcome it, which it believed the prosecution failed to do.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presumption of Innocence:** Basic Constitutional Guarantee.
*   **Rape:** Crime charged under the Revised Penal Code.
