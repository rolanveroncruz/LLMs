**Case:** *First Sarmiento Property Holdings, Inc. vs. Philippine Bank of Communications* (G.R. No. 202836, June 19, 2018)

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision dismissing a complaint for annulment of a real estate mortgage due to lack of jurisdiction stemming from allegedly insufficient docket fees.  The Supreme Court (SC) *granted* the petition, reversed the RTC decision, and remanded the case for trial. The SC clarified the distinction between actions capable and incapable of pecuniary estimation, and emphasized that *Home Guaranty Corporation v. R-II Builders, Inc.* (G.R. No. 192549, March 9, 2011) should not be interpreted as overturning established jurisprudence on determining the nature of an action for jurisdictional purposes. Also the court passed upon the legality of RTC extending the TRO indefinitely, the temporary restraining order already expired and in the absence of the preliminary injunction there was nothing to stop the Sheriff from registering the certificate of sale with Registry of Deeds.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement & Real Estate Mortgage:** First Sarmiento obtained loans from PBCOM secured by a real estate mortgage over multiple properties.  The loan amount was subsequently increased through amendments. The mortgage agreement gave PBCOM recourse to extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Annulment of Mortgage:** First Sarmiento filed a complaint seeking to annul the mortgage and its amendments, alleging they never received the loan proceeds. They prayed for a TRO/preliminary injunction to prevent foreclosure and registration of the certificate of sale.
*   **Foreclosure:** PBCOM initiated extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings due to First Sarmiento's alleged failure to pay. PBCOM was the highest bidder at the auction.
*   **Docket Fees:** The central dispute revolves around whether the complaint for annulment of mortgage is an action "incapable of pecuniary estimation" or a "real action" requiring docket fees based on the property's value.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PBCOM's Potential Liability:** If First Sarmiento succeeds in its annulment claim, PBCOM's foreclosure sale could be invalidated, requiring them to return the properties or their value.
*   **First Sarmiento's Potential Liability:** If the annulment claim fails, First Sarmiento remains liable for the outstanding loan amount, and the foreclosure stands.
*   **Risk of Extended Litigation:** The remand of the case prolongs the legal battle, incurring further costs and uncertainty for both parties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980):** Defines the jurisdiction of Regional Trial Courts (RTC) and Municipal Trial Courts.  Specifically, Section 19(1) grants RTC jurisdiction over "all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation." Sections 33(1) and 33(3) defines jurisdiction of First level court, it provided the amount of demand does not exceed P100,000 or P200,000 in Metro Manila and civil actions involving title, possession of or any interest in real property where the value does not exceed P20,000.00 or P50,000.00
*   **Act No. 3135, Section 6:** Regulates extrajudicial foreclosure sales. Governs the redemption period - which is one year after the date of registration of the Certificate of Sale with the Register of Deeds.
*   ***Lu v. Lu Ym*** **(585 Phil. 251 (2008)):**  Reiterated that where the primary relief sought is not recovery of a sum of money or real property, but something else, even if a money claim results as a consequence, the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation.
*   ***Home Guaranty Corporation v. R-II Builders, Inc.*** **(660 Phil. 517 (2011)):** The SC *set aside* the contrary rule espoused in this ruling, it erred in treating as a real action simply because the principal action was accompanied by a prayer for conveyance of real property. The action was actually incapable of pecuniary estimation. The Court emphasized that the nature of an action is determined by the principal relief sought in the complaint, irrespective of other causes of actions that may also crop up as a consequence of the principal relief prayed for.
*   **Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court** provide instances when a temporary restraining order (TRO) may be issued.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Nature of the Action:** The core issue is whether First Sarmiento's action is for *annulment of mortgage* (incapable of pecuniary estimation, jurisdiction in RTC) or *recovery of real property* (real action, docket fees based on property value, which was argued to be unpaid).
*   **"True Objective" vs. Principal Relief:** PBCOM argued that First Sarmiento's true objective was to recover the foreclosed properties, making it a real action.  The SC rejected this argument, emphasizing that the *principal relief* sought in the complaint determines jurisdiction.
*   **Extension of TRO:** RTC's issuance of a *status quo ante* order effectively extending the TRO beyond its legal limit (20 days or 72 hours, depending on the circumstances) was improper.

**Legal Analysis & Recommendations:**

*   The SC's decision correctly applies the established test for determining jurisdiction â€“ focusing on the *principal relief sought*.
*   The clarification regarding *Home Guaranty* is crucial to prevent future misinterpretations of jurisdictional rules.
*   The finding that the RTC improperly extended the TRO highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules.

**For counsel advising PBCOM:**

1.  The SC decision is a setback. Focus on the merits of the foreclosure. Prepare to argue that First Sarmiento *did* receive the loan proceeds, and the mortgage is valid.
2.  Consider a settlement to avoid further legal expenses and uncertainty.
3.  Comply strictly with court orders and procedural rules during the remanded trial.

**For counsel advising First Sarmiento:**

1.  Prepare strong evidence to support the claim that the loan proceeds were never received.
2.  Monitor the proceedings closely to ensure PBCOM's compliance with court orders.
