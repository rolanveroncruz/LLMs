**Case Summary: *People v. De la Cruz*, G.R. No. 123397, October 13, 1998**

**Facts:**

Benjamin de la Cruz was convicted of Murder for the death of Rolando Millan.  The RTC found De la Cruz, along with his brother Fernando (at large), attacked Millan.  Benjamin struck Millan with a shovel and Fernando stabbed him.  Rogelio Millan, the victim's brother, witnessed the attack and identified Benjamin. The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction. The Supreme Court reviewed the case due to the imposed penalty.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for Murder but modified the penalty to account for voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Qualifying Circumstance:** Treachery - The attack was sudden and unexpected, ensuring the victim had no chance to defend himself. *People v. Baydo, G.R. No. 113799, 17 June 1997, 273 SCRA 526, 537-538.*
*   **Conspiracy:** The brothers acted in concert, demonstrating a unity of purpose in their assault. *People v. Datun, G.R. No. 118080, 7 July 1997, 272 SCRA 380, 389-390.*
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:** Voluntary Surrender - The accused presented himself to authorities shortly after the incident. (Art. 64, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Evidence:** Eyewitness testimony of Rogelio Millan was deemed credible and sufficient for conviction. Positive identification, even by a single witness, is sufficient when credible. *People v. Obello, G.R. No. 108772, 14 January 1998*

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Benjamin de la Cruz is criminally liable for Murder.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Ordered to indemnify the heirs of Rolando Millan:
    *   P50,000.00 for Rolando Millan's death (civil indemnity). *People v. Salcedo, G.R. No. 100920, 17 June 1997, 273 SCRA 473, 496-497.*
    *   P7,000.00 for funeral expenses (supported by receipts).

**Penalties:**

*   Original Sentence: *Reclusion Perpetua* by the CA.
*   Modified Sentence: Indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years, six (6) months and ten (10) days of *prision mayor* maximum as minimum to seventeen (17) years, eight (8) months and twenty (20) days of *reclusion temporal* maximum as maximum.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Eyewitness Credibility:** The defense argued Rogelio Millan's failure to assist his brother and initial reluctance to provide a statement undermined his credibility. However, the court found his behavior to be indicative of the stress he was under and not reflective of dishonesty. It should be noted that inconsistent affidavits prior to trial testimony can call into question credibility.
*   **Uncounseled Confession:** The defense argued the trial court improperly considered De la Cruz's uncounseled confession. The Supreme Court stated the conviction was based on eyewitness testimony and not the alleged confession, mitigating this risk. The argument here could be on the admissibility of the confession and the weight it carried in the original finding of fact by the RTC.
*   **Fernando de la Cruz at large:** The unresolved status of the co-accused Fernando, while not directly affecting Benjamin's conviction, could potentially introduce further complications if Fernando were to be apprehended and tried later.
*   **Alibi Rejection:** The alibi defense failed due to the close proximity of the accused's claimed location to the crime scene. An important risk is the ability for the prosecution to undermine the alibi defense.
