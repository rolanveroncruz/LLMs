## Legal Document Summary: People v. Labagala (G.R. No. 221427)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) Decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Issue:** Whether the prosecution sufficiently proved the elements of Robbery with Homicide and conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision convicting Alvin and Romeo Labagala of Robbery with Homicide. The conviction stemmed from an incident where the appellants, along with co-accused, robbed the victim and, on the occasion thereof, killed him. The SC found that the prosecution established all elements of the crime through the positive and credible testimony of a single eyewitness, Jun. The SC also upheld the finding of conspiracy, noting the coordinated actions of the appellants in committing the robbery, and their failure to prevent the subsequent killing of the victim.

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **Article 294, par. 1, RPC:** Defines Robbery with Homicide. Requires proof of:
    *   Taking of personal property with violence or intimidation.
    *   Property belonging to another.
    *   Intent to gain (animus lucrandi).
    *   Homicide committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery.
*   **Homicide (Generic Sense):** The term "homicide" includes murder, parricide, and infanticide.
*   **Conspiracy:** Established through the confederated actions and mutual aid of the accused in the commission of the crime, demonstrating a common purpose.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The SC affirmed the conviction for Robbery with Homicide, subjecting the appellants to the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** The SC increased the monetary awards, jointly and severally, payable to the heirs of the victim:
    *   Civil Indemnity: Increased to P75,000.00.
    *   Moral Damages: Increased to P75,000.00.
    *   Temperate Damages: Increased to P50,000.00.
    *   Exemplary Damages: Added P75,000.00.
    *   Interest: All damages awarded to earn 6% interest per annum from finality of judgment.
* **Restitution** Ordered the return to the victim's heirs of the stolen two rings, a necklace and a wristwatch

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Single Witness Testimony:** The defense argued that the prosecution's case hinged on the uncorroborated testimony of Jun. The SC addressed this, stating that a single, credible witness is sufficient for conviction.
*   **Conspiracy Liability:** Appellants are held liable for the homicide even if they did not directly participate in the killing because of their participation in the robbery and failure to prevent the killing.
* **Alibi:** The defence of alibi failed due to the positive identification by the prosecution's witness

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 294, par. 1:** Defines the crime of Robbery with Homicide and its corresponding penalty.
*   **People v. De Jesus, 473 Phil. 405 (2004):** Defines the elements of robbery with homicide.
*   **People v. Madrelejos, G.R. No. 225328, March 21, 2018:** Outlines elements for conviction of robbery with homicide
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Jurisprudence used in adjusting damage awards.

**Ambiguities & Open Questions:**

*   The decision does not elaborate on any potential mitigating circumstances that could affect the penalty. The focus remained on the elements of the crime and the finding of conspiracy.
