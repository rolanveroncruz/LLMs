Okay, here's a legal summary of *Philippine National Bank vs. Cayetano A. Tejano, Jr.*, G.R. No. 173615, October 16, 2009, focusing on key legal aspects:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the Court of Appeals (CA) decision to remand Cayetano Tejano's administrative case back to the Civil Service Commission (CSC) for further proceedings. The central issue is whether the privatization of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) via Executive Order (E.O.) No. 80 removed the CSC's jurisdiction over a pending disciplinary case against Tejano, a former PNB Vice-President, for acts allegedly committed while PNB was still a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC). The SC ruled E.O. No. 80 did not divest the CSC of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **E.O. No. 80 (Revised Charter of PNB), Section 6:**  This section states PNB ceases to be a GOCC, and no longer subject to CSC and COA coverage, upon issuance of articles of incorporation by the SEC after majority ownership passes to private investors.
*   **P.D. No. 807 (Civil Service Decree), Section 37:**  Confers upon the CSC disciplinary jurisdiction over appeals involving penalties such as suspension exceeding 30 days, fines, demotion, transfer, removal, or dismissal.
*   **PNB Board Resolution:** Initially imposed forced resignation with forfeiture of benefits, later appealed by Tejano.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Tejano's Liability:** Accused of grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty, conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and violation of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) related to transactions involving several corporate entities. Potential penalties range from suspension to dismissal, depending on the CSC's findings.
*   **PNB's Risk:** Potential liability for reinstatement, back wages, or other damages if Tejano's appeal is ultimately successful before the CSC. The bank faces reputational risk if the allegations of fraudulent transactions are substantiated.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. No. 80:** Critical statutory instrument defining the effects of PNB's privatization.
*   **P.D. No. 807:**  Establishes the CSC's disciplinary jurisdiction over government employees.
*   **RA 3019:** Charges against Tejano include violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Civil Code, Article 4:**  Laws generally have prospective effect.
*   ***Latchme Motoomull v. Dela Paz*, G.R. No. 45302, July 24, 1990, 187 SCRA 743:**  Cited regarding transfer of jurisdiction to another tribunal by a supervening legislation.
*   ***Bengzon v. Inciong*, G.R. Nos. L-48706-07, June 29, 1979, 91 SCRA 248:** Doctrine that once a court has acquired jurisdiction, it is not affected by new legislation unless the statute expressly provides or is construed as intended to operate on actions pending before enactment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Interpretation of E.O. No. 80, Section 6:** PNB argued that Section 6 should be interpreted to retroactively divest the CSC of jurisdiction over pending cases. This argument was rejected by the CA and the SC. The SC found the language of Section 6 plain and unambiguous, only stating the consequence of the transfer of ownership to private investors.
*   **Retroactivity vs. Prospectivity:** PNB asserted Section 6 should apply retroactively to pending cases, while Tejano argued against retroactive application.  The SC applied the general rule of prospectivity, citing *lex prospicit, non respicit.*
*   **Continuing Jurisdiction:** PNB argued that the general rule of continuing jurisdiction is inapplicable where the law provides otherwise. The Court rejected this because E.O. No. 80 did not expressly or impliedly divest the CSC of jurisdiction over pending cases.
*   **Estoppel:** Tejano raised the issue of estoppel against PNB, arguing that PNB actively participated in the proceedings before the CSC and was therefore barred from raising the issue of jurisdiction. While not explicitly ruled upon by the court, the court found that it was unnecessary to discuss the other issues propounded by the parties, this would be an argument that should be brought up on remand to the CSC.

**Potential Outcomes:**

*   The case proceeds before the CSC.
*   The CSC will evaluate the evidence and determine if Tejano committed the alleged offenses.
*   The CSC will impose appropriate penalties if Tejano is found guilty.
*   Either party can appeal the CSC's decision to the Court of Appeals.
*   Tejano may use the defense of laches for the delay in the final resolution of the appeal to the CSC.
