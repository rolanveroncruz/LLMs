Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Jesus Cuenco vs. Talisay Tourist Sports Complex, Incorporated and Matias B. Aznar III* (G.R. No. 174154, October 17, 2008)

**Subject Matter:**  Dispute over the return of a security deposit after the expiration of a lease agreement.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Cuenco (Petitioner) leased a sports complex from Talisay Tourist Sports Complex, Inc. (Respondent), represented by Matias B. Aznar III. The lease was for a cockpit operation. The lease included clauses requiring the lessee to maintain the property, allow inspections, repair damages, and provide a P500,000 deposit.
*   **Expiration & Bidding:** The lease expired. Cuenco participated in a rebidding but was unsuccessful.
*   **Demand for Deposit:** Cuenco made multiple demands for the return of the deposit. The corporation did not meet his request for a release of liability for minor damages in the original lease.
*   **Inventory Dispute:** Crucially, at pre-trial, the Respondent's counsel admitted that no inventory of damages was conducted after the lease expired. However, during trial, evidence of inventories and repair costs were presented by the respondents in court.
*   **RTC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of Cuenco, ordering the return of the deposit with interest and litigation expenses, finding respondents failed to credibly prove damages.
*   **CA Reversal:** The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, finding that damages exceeded the deposit based on testimony and purported repair expenses. The new lessor bore the cost of the repair and renovation.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) *partially granted* the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the RTC decision with modifications.

**Key Legal Issues/Reasoning:**

1.  **Judicial Admission (Rule 129, Section 4, Rules of Court):** The SC emphasized that the respondents' admission during pre-trial that *no inventory* was conducted was a *judicial admission*. This admission is binding and conclusive unless demonstrably made through palpable mistake, which was not established. Evidence contradicting this admission should not have been considered by the CA. *Binarao v. Plus Builders, Inc., G.R. No. 154430, June 16, 2006, 491 SCRA 49*, *Ramos v. Dizon, G.R. No. 137247, August 7, 2006, 498 SCRA 17, 34*, and *Yujuico v. Atienza, Jr., G.R. No. 164282, October 12, 2005, 472 SCRA 463*.
2.  **Burden of Proof:** The Respondent, as the lessor retaining the deposit, bore the burden of proving damages that justified the retention. They failed to do so credibly, especially considering the judicial admission and the fact that many alleged repair expenses were not clearly tied to the specific property or were incurred by the new lessee.
3.  **Overstay and Rental (Articles 1670 and 1687, Civil Code):** The SC found that Cuenco did overstay by two months and did not pay rentals, based on unrebutted evidence. The amount for the monthly rental will be deducted from the deposit.
4.  **Interest Rate (Article 2213, Civil Code):** The court stipulated a six percent (6%) interest rate on the amount due computed from October 21, 1998, the day the case was filed, and TWELVE PERCENT (12%) interest, thereon upon finality of this decision until full payment thereof. *Eastern Shipping Lines v. CA, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 79*.
5.  **Corporate Liability:** The SC held Matias B. Aznar III *not* personally liable because his actions were in his capacity as a corporate officer. The corporation is a separate juridical entity. *Siemens Philippines, Inc. v. Enrico A. Domingo, GR. No. 150488, July 28, 2008.*

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Talisay Sports Complex, Inc. is obligated to return the deposit, less two months of rent.
*   Interest accrues at 6% from the filing of the complaint, increasing to 12% upon finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Counter-Signed Inventory:** The absence of a countersigned inventory could be a source of future disputes regarding the condition of the property and the amount of deductions the corporation can claim.
*   **Interest Rate Fluctuations:** The changing interest rates post-judgment are a potential issue to monitor.

**Summary of Ruling:**

The SC prioritized the binding effect of a judicial admission made during pre-trial. The lessor could not contradict this admission with later evidence. While the lessee did incur a liability for the two-month overstay, the lessor could not justify retaining the entire deposit based on the evidence presented.
