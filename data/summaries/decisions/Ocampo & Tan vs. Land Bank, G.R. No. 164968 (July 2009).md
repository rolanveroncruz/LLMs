## Legal Document Summary: *Ocampo v. Land Bank* (G.R. No. 164968)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's declaration of nullity of a real estate mortgage and the subsequent extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Quedan Loan:** Petitioners (Ocampo and Tan) obtained a P10M loan from Land Bank secured by quedans (grain warehouse receipts) guaranteed by Quedancor for 80% of the loan.
*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** To secure the remaining 20% unsecured portion, Petitioners executed a real estate mortgage over unregistered land owned by Ocampo.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** Upon default, Land Bank initiated extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners claimed the mortgage was a forgery and that the loan was fully paid through a Deed of Absolute Assignment to Quedancor.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to repay the P10M loan to Land Bank, including interest.
*   **Land Bank:** Obligated to release the mortgage upon full repayment of the loan and interest.
*   **Quedancor:** Obligated to guarantee 80% of the loan.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Liable for the outstanding loan balance, interest, and foreclosure costs.
*   **Land Bank:** Potential liability for damages if the foreclosure was wrongful.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Foreclosure Risk:** Petitioners risk losing the mortgaged properties if they fail to satisfy the debt.
*   **Validity of Mortgage:** The primary risk involved whether the Real Estate Mortgage was valid in securing the 20% of the loan obligation
*   **Loan Extinguishment:** The Supreme Court ultimately found that the the Deed of Assignment to Quedancor didn't extinguish the Loan.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.
*   **Civil Code Article 1338:** Defines fraud in contracts. Used in relation to the contract of mortgage of real property.
*   **Civil Code provisions on Dacion en Pago:** Court assessed whether a Dacion en Pago occurred, finding that there was no consensus for said contract.
*   **Rules of Evidence on Public Documents:** Court cited rules of Evidence on validity of public documents (acknowledged documents are presumed regular).
*   **Vales v. Villa, 35 Phil. 769 (1916)**: Court quoted this case on the principle that the Courts do not protect foolish acts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Blank Form" Issue:** Ocampo claimed she signed a blank mortgage form, raising potential issues of consent and validity. This claim was rejected due to lack of clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Deed of Absolute Assignment:** The effect of the Deed of Absolute Assignment between Ocampo and Quedancor on the loan obligation to Land Bank was contentious, as the Land Bank was not a party to the agreement.

**Summary & Analysis:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the real estate mortgage and the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings. The court found no forgery, as Ocampo admitted signing the mortgage. The court rejected the claim of fraud, stating that the Deed of Assignment to Quedancor did not extinguish the debt due to lack of consent from the Land Bank. The Court also emphasized the presumption of regularity for notarized documents and the burden on Petitioners to prove the contrary. The main risk for the Petitioners is the loss of mortgaged properties to settle the loan. Land Bank has a stronger position due to the valid mortgage and established debt.
