**Legal Document Summary: *China Banking Corporation vs. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 172359, October 02, 2009 (617 Phil. 522)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc decision upholding deficiency documentary stamp tax (DST) assessment on China Bank's Special Savings Deposits (SSDs).

**Key Issue:** Whether China Bank's SSDs (specifically "Savings Plus Deposit") are subject to DST under Section 180 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), prior to amendment by RA 9243.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CTA En Banc decision. The SC held that the SSDs are "certificates of deposit drawing interest" under Section 180 of the 1997 NIRC and therefore subject to DST.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 180, 1997 NIRC (prior to RA 9243):** Imposes DST on various instruments, including "certificates of deposit drawing interest."
*   **Obligation to pay DST:** China Bank is obligated to pay DST on SSDs for taxable years 1994-1997. Recomputed amounts of P4,016,822.48, P4,265,646.61, P1,218,750.00 and P1,890,000.00 or in the total amount of P11,391,219.09, plus 20% delinquency interest from February 24, 2002 until full payment.

**Key Arguments & Analysis:**

*   **China Bank's Argument:** SSDs are similar to regular savings accounts (evidenced by passbooks, withdrawable anytime) and not "certificates of deposit drawing interest" or akin to time deposits. They argue Section 180 doesn't cover them.
*   **CIR's Argument:** SSDs have features similar to time deposits (higher interest rates for maintaining balances for fixed periods), thus falling under "certificates of deposit drawing interest."
*   **SC's Rationale:**  Relied on *International Exchange Bank v. CIR* (G.R. No. 171266, April 4, 2007) and *Philippine Banking Corporation v. CIR* (G.R. No. 170574, January 30, 2009). The SC found that China Bank's "Savings Plus Deposit" has features similar to Savings Account-Fixed Savings Deposit in *International Exchange Bank* and Special/Super Savings Account in *PBC*, which were both ruled as subject to DST, becuase the nature of the account provides a higher interest rate than normal savings, but also allows for some withdrawal, which is more similar to fixed-term certificates of deposit, because the rate is dependant on the balance.
*   **Passbook Argument Rejected:** SC held that a passbook can represent a "certificate of deposit drawing interest" as long as it evidences the bank's acceptance of a deposit.
*   **Impact of RA 9243:** China Bank argued that the amendment of Section 180 by RA 9243 (explicitly including "other evidences of deposits that are either drawing interest significantly higher than the regular savings deposit") indicated the old Section 180 didn't cover SSDs.
*   **SC's Counter-Argument:**  Relied on *International Exchange Bank v. CIR*, holding that RA 9243 merely clarified existing ambiguity and was intended to prevent banks from "cloaking" time deposits as savings accounts.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   Deficiency DST.
*   Surcharges.
*   Delinquency interest (20% from February 24, 2002, until full payment, per Section 249(c) of the 1997 Tax Code).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Certificates of Deposit Drawing Interest":** The core dispute centers on the interpretation of this phrase. China Bank argued for a narrow interpretation, focusing on the *form* of the deposit (passbook vs. certificate). The CIR and the SC favored a broader, *substance-over-form* approach, focusing on the economic characteristics of the deposit (interest rates, withdrawal conditions).
*   **Retroactive Application:**  The assessment covers taxable years 1994-1997. While the SC argues RA 9243 was merely clarifying existing law, there's a potential argument (though weakened by *International Exchange Bank*) that the broadened interpretation of "certificates of deposit drawing interest" is being applied retroactively, potentially violating principles of statutory construction.
*   **Industry-Wide Implications:** The ruling has implications for other banks offering similar deposit products.
*   **Fact-Specific Analysis:** The determination of whether a deposit product constitutes a "certificate of deposit drawing interest" is fact-specific, requiring analysis of the specific features and terms of the product.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Section 180, 1997 National Internal Revenue Code (prior to amendment)
*   Republic Act No. 9243
*   *International Exchange Bank v. CIR* (G.R. No. 171266, April 4, 2007)
*   *Philippine Banking Corporation v. CIR* (G.R. No. 170574, January 30, 2009)
*   Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Querimit, 424 Phil 721, 730 (2002).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with the CIR, finding China Bank liable for deficiency DST on its Special Savings Deposits. This case reaffirms the principle that the economic substance of a financial product, rather than its form, determines its tax treatment.
