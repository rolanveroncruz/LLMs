**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Leong v. Hon. Eduardo Israel Tanguanco***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal of a petition against a writ of possession granted to Hermosa Savings and Loan Bank, Inc. (Hermosa Bank).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** Hermosa Bank purchased properties at an extrajudicial foreclosure sale after petitioners failed to redeem.
*   **Writ of Possession:** Hermosa Bank filed for and was granted an *ex-parte* writ of possession by the RTC.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Petitioners argue the underlying mortgage and loan agreements were simulated and without consideration, made solely for Bangko Sentral audit purposes to cover up another’s loan.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated under loan agreements and mortgages (disputed), potentially liable for debt if the validity of the loan is upheld.
*   **Hermosa Bank:** Entitled to possession as the purchaser at foreclosure sale *if* the sale is valid; Potentially liable for damages if the underlying transactions are proven fraudulent.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Mortgage:** The central dispute revolves around the validity of the mortgage and loan agreements, which petitioners claim are simulated. This directly impacts the validity of the foreclosure and the Bank’s right to possession.
*   **Mootness:** The CA dismissed the case as moot because the writ of possession had already been executed. However, this is contentious because the underlying legal issues remain unresolved.
*   **Status Quo Violation:** Petitioners allege Hermosa Bank violated a *status quo* agreement in a prior case (Civil Case No. 89-3101) regarding the foreclosure, potentially giving rise to an estoppel argument against the Bank.
*   **Laches/Waiver:** The Bank could argue that petitioners’ failure to redeem the property after the foreclosure implies a waiver of their claims to invalidity.
*   **Contract of Adhesion** Petitioners claim that the mortgage contracts they signed in favor of Hermosa Bank are contracts of adhesion

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 7:** Governs the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages; determines the court with jurisdiction.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 39, Section 35:** Governing execution of judgement.
*   **Cometa v. Intermediate Appellate Court (No. L-69294, June 30, 1987, 151 SCRA 563):**  Cited by petitioners to argue that the validity of the mortgage should be resolved before issuing a writ of possession.
*   **Barican v. Intermediate Appellate Court (No. L-79906, June 20, 1988, 162 SCRA 358):**  Cited by petitioners to argue that the issuance of a writ of possession is not unqualified.
*   **Active Wood Products Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 86603, February 5, 1990, 181 SCRA 774):** Cited by petitioners arguing for consolidation of the case with Civil Case No. LP-99-0072.
*   **Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation (Solidbank) v. Intermediate Appellate Court (No. L-73976, May 29, 1987, 150 SCRA 591):** Cited by Petitioners arguing that the pendency of an action tolls the term for the exercise of the right of redemption.
*   **Spouses Eduardo Vaca and Ma. Luisita Pilar v. Court of Appeals and Associated Bank (G.R. No. 109672, 14 July 1994):** Cited by the court to argue that the pendency of a separate civil suit questioning the validity of the mortgage cannot be a legal ground for refusing the issuance of a writ of possession
*   **Vda. de Jacob v. Court of Appeals (G.R. Nos. 88602 & 89544, 06 April 1990, 184 SCRA 1990):** Cited by the court to argue that the pendency of a separate civil suit questioning the validity of the mortgage cannot be a legal ground for refusing the issuance of a writ of possession
*   **Navarra v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 86237, 17 December 1991, 204 SCRA 850):** Cited by the court to argue that the pendency of a separate civil suit questioning the validity of the mortgage cannot be a legal ground for refusing the issuance of a writ of possession

**Ambiguities & Contentious Points:**

*   The central ambiguity lies in whether the loan agreements were indeed simulated, requiring resolution of factual disputes regarding intent, consideration, and alleged representations by the Bank's president.
*   The CA’s dismissal based on mootness is questionable, as the underlying dispute over the mortgage's validity remains unresolved and affects property rights.
*   Whether the prior *status quo* agreement had legal effect and was violated by the bank.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case hinges on the petitioners' ability to prove the alleged simulation of the loan agreements. The dismissal by the CA on grounds of mootness may be erroneous, potentially warranting Supreme Court intervention to address the fundamental issues of the validity of the mortgage and related agreements. The petitioners may need to avail themselves of appropriate remedies depending upon the outcome in the RTC of Las Piñas case.
