## Legal Document Summary: Dee C. Chuan & Sons, Inc. vs. Judge William Simon P. Peralta (A.M. No. RTJ-05-1917)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against a Regional Trial Court Judge.

**Facts:** Dee C. Chuan & Sons, Inc. (DCCSI) filed a complaint against Judge Peralta for undue delay in resolving pending motions in Civil Case No. 02-105031, an appeal from an unlawful detainer case (MeTC Manila Br. 6, Case No. 161061-CV). DCCSI filed a "motion to dismiss appeal and for issuance of writ of execution" on March 18, 2003. Several motions to resolve were subsequently filed. Judge Peralta failed to resolve these motions for over a year.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Section 15:** Mandates resolution of cases/matters in lower courts within 90 days.
*   **Canon of Judicial Ethics & Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 3, Rule 3.05):** Requires judges to dispose of court business promptly and decide cases within required periods. *Note:* The New Code of Judicial Conduct, Sec. 5 provides for promptness.
*   **Rule 140, Section 9 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC):** Defines undue delay in rendering a decision/order and violation of Supreme Court directives as less serious charges.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):**
    *   **Canon 1:** Uphold the Constitution, obey laws.
    *   **Canon 11:** Observe and maintain respect due to the courts.
    *   **Canon 12:** Assist in speedy and efficient administration of justice.
    *   **Rule 12.04:** Do not unduly delay a case.
*   **A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC:** Establishes concurrent disciplinary jurisdiction over judges as members of the bar.

**Liabilities & Penalties Imposed:**

*   **Guilty of two less serious offenses:** Undue delay and violation of Supreme Court directives.
*   **Fine:** PhP 15,000 (for the offenses above).
*   **Fine:** PhP 5,000 (for violating Canons 1, 11, 12, and Rule 12.04 of the CPR).
*   **Stern Warning:** Future similar acts will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Severity of Penalty:** While classified as "less serious," the Court emphasizes the detrimental impact of delay on the administration of justice. The *rationale* behind the fine amount, could be argued as disproportionate, but the court considered the conduct as both judicial misconduct and a violation of lawyer ethical responsibilities.
*   **Summary Nature of Unlawful Detainer:** The Court stresses the importance of prompt resolution in unlawful detainer cases due to their summary nature, implying a higher standard of diligence is expected.  Cites *Bernaldez v. Avelino*, noting such cases are a matter of public policy and *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Generoso*, attributing delay to respondent himself.
*   **Indifference to Administrative Complaint:** The Judge's failure to adequately address the accusations in his comment is seen as a sign of disrespect to the Court and exacerbates the offense.
*   **Lack of Justification:** No mitigating factors or acceptable justifications were presented by the respondent for the delay.

The penalties imposed, while considered "less serious," are substantial and indicate a zero-tolerance policy for undue delays.
