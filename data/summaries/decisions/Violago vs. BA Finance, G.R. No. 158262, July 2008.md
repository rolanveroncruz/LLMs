## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Pedro and Florencia Violago vs. BA Finance Corporation and Avelino Violago* (G.R. No. 158262)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision holding petitioners liable on a promissory note and chattel mortgage. The core issue revolves around the negotiability of the promissory note, holder in due course status of BA Finance, and the applicability of piercing the corporate veil to hold Avelino Violago liable.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Note & Chattel Mortgage:** Spouses Violago signed a promissory note jointly and severally promising to pay VMSC (Violago Motor Sales Corporation) PhP 209,601, secured by a chattel mortgage over a Toyota Cressida.
*   **Assignment:** VMSC endorsed the promissory note "without recourse" and assigned its rights under the note and chattel mortgage to BA Finance.
*   **Non-Delivery:** The car was never delivered to the Spouses Violago. It had previously been sold to Esmeraldo Violago.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The promissory note stipulated joint and several liability for Pedro and Florencia Violago.
*   **Holder in Due Course:** Court finds BA Finance to be a holder in due course.
*   **Third Party Complaint:** Spouses Violago filed a third-party complaint against Avelino Violago, President of VMSC, seeking indemnification.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sps. Violago:** Initially held liable by the RTC and CA to BA Finance for the amount due under the promissory note (PhP 198,003.06 + penalties, attorney's fees, and liquidated damages).
*   **Avelino Violago:** The Supreme Court ultimately held Avelino personally liable for the indemnification of the Sps. Violago.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Without Recourse" Endorsement:** While VMSC endorsed the note "without recourse," the central issue is not VMSC's liability to BA Finance, but the Sps. Violago's liability and Avelino's personal liability to the Sps. Violago.
*   **Holder in Due Course Status:** The determination of whether BA Finance had notice of the prior sale to Esmeraldo Violago *at the time of negotiation* is critical for establishing holder in due course status. This affects the defenses available to the Spouses Violago. While the court found it to be in due course, a dissenting opinion could have leveraged the fact that there was a previous chattel mortage registered with the CEBU branch to argue that it had knowledge.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The application of this doctrine is contentious, requiring proof of control, fraud, and proximate causation. The Court found that Avelino's actions warranted piercing the veil. A thorough review of the factual evidence supporting these elements is crucial.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL):**
    *   Section 1 (Requirements of a Negotiable Instrument)
    *   Section 8 (Payable to order)
    *   Section 24 (Presumption of Consideration)
    *   Section 52 (Holder in Due Course)
    *   Section 57 (Rights of a Holder in Due Course)
    *   Section 58 (Rights of a Holder Not in Due Course)
    *   Section 59 (Presumption of Holder in Due Course)
*   **Civil Code Article 1318:** Relates to the essential requisites of a contract.
*   **Concept Builders, Inc. v. NLRC:** Sets forth the test for piercing the corporate veil.
*   **Arcilla v. Court of Appeals:** Establishes that a corporate president can be held liable even if the corporation is not a party to the suit.
*   **Salas v. Court of Appeals:**  Addresses a holder in due course and the defense of the nullity of the contract of sale.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The promissory note language is standard, but the circumstances surrounding its execution (prior sale, Avelino's representations) create ambiguity regarding the validity of the underlying transaction and good faith.

**Summary Judgment:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision dismissing the third-party complaint against Avelino Violago. The Court applied the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, holding Avelino personally liable for the damages caused by his fraudulent actions because he used VMSC as a business conduit. The Spouses Violago must satisfy the liability to BA Finance under the promissory note, but Avelino must indemnify the Spouses Violago for the judgment amount, down payment, and other damages.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

* If a dissenting opinion was being crafted, the argument would be that the BA Finance knew of the dual mortages and that the corporate viel should not be pierced.
