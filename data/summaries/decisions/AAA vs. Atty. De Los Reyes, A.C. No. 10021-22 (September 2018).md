### Legal Document Summary: *AAA v. Atty. Antonio N. De Los Reyes* (A.C. No. 10021-22)

**Overview:**

This Supreme Court decision involves two consolidated administrative complaints filed by AAA against Atty. Antonio N. De Los Reyes, seeking his disbarment based on allegations of sexual harassment ("sextortion") and gross immoral conduct, violating the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Court ultimately DISBARRED Atty. De Los Reyes.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility Violations:** Atty. De Los Reyes was found guilty of violating Rule 1.01 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral conduct) and Rule 7.03 (conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice law) of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Factual Basis:** The Court relied heavily on AAA's testimony, finding it credible. The testimony detailed incidents of forced sexual intercourse, threats to AAA's employment, and a pattern of abuse of power. The Court classified this as "sextortion."
*   **Sui Generis Nature of Disbarment:** The Court emphasized that disbarment proceedings are *sui generis*, focusing on the lawyer's fitness to practice law to protect the public and the courts, not to provide relief to the complainant as in a civil case. *[Pena v. Aparicio, 552 Phil. 512, 521 (2007)]*
*   **Gross Immoral Conduct:** The Court held that Atty. De Los Reyes's actions constituted gross immorality, defined as conduct that is willful, flagrant, or shameless, and that shows a moral indifference to the opinion of the upright and respectable members of the community.*[ Ventura v. Samson, 699 Phil. 404, 415 (2012)]*
*   **No Prescription:** The Court found that despite the potential prescriptive period for sexual harassment under the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law, there is no prescriptive period for grave misconduct in disbarment proceedings and the Code of Professional Responsibility.
* **Good Moral Character:** The Court reinforced the principle that possession of good moral character is a prerequisite and continuing requirement for the practice of law.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. De Los Reyes's Disbarment:** Atty. De Los Reyes is barred from practicing law, and his name is to be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.
*   **Continuing Duty of Lawyers:** Lawyers have a continuous obligation to maintain good moral character, honesty, probity and good demeanor. Any errant behavior may subject them to suspension or disbarment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Testimony:** The decision relies heavily on the complainant's testimony.
*   **"Sextortion" Definition:** The court's characterization of the events as sextortion highlights the abuse of power dynamic.
