## Legal Document Summary: CJH Development Corporation vs. Bureau of Internal Revenue, et al. (G.R. No. 172457)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Propriety of CJH's petition for declaratory relief against BIR and BOC assessments following the partial declaration of unconstitutionality of Section 3 of Proclamation No. 420 in *John Hay Peoples Alternative Coalition v. Lim* (G.R. No. 119775).  Specifically, whether the *John Hay* ruling can be applied retroactively.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Proclamation No. 420:** Created the John Hay Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and initially granted the same incentives as Subic SEZ (tax and duty-free importations, etc.). Section 3 was partially invalidated by the Supreme Court in *John Hay* (G.R. No. 119775).
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 12-97 & Customs Administrative Order No. 2-98:** Implemented Proclamation No. 420 within the Camp John Hay SEZ; their validity and effect are impacted by the *John Hay* ruling.
*   **Tariff and Customs Code (TCC):** Provides administrative and judicial remedies for contesting assessments.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 55:** Prohibits declaratory relief actions against tax liabilities assessed by the BIR or BOC.

**Liabilities:**

*   The BIR and BOC seek to collect unpaid taxes and duties from CJH, asserting that with the partial invalidation of Section 3 of Proclamation No. 420, CJH is no longer entitled to tax exemptions/incentives retroactively.
*   City of Baguio is seeking updated real property taxes

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Retroactivity of *John Hay* Ruling:** The central contentious point. The BIR and BOC assert retroactive application, while CJH argues against it. This risk stems from the lack of clarity and/or absence of clear guidance from the Supreme Court regarding the application of the *John Hay* ruling to past transactions. (Potential application of operative fact doctrine.)
*   **Procedural Impropriety:** The Supreme Court highlights that declaratory relief is not the proper remedy given CA No. 55 remains in effect. Furthermore, the Court states a judicial decision cannot be subject to a petition for declaratory relief and that administrative remedies exist under the TCC. This raises significant risks for CJH's litigation strategy.
*   **Pending Litigation (G.R. No. 169234):** The existence of a prior petition (Camp John Hay Development Corporation v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals, et al.) involving the same question of law weakens CJH's position and suggests forum shopping, as admitted in their certificate of non-forum shopping.
*   **Ambiguity Regarding "Other Written Instrument":** CJH attempts to frame the BOC demand letter as an "other written instrument" subject to declaratory relief. The court rejects this, reinforcing the limited scope of declaratory relief.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **John Hay Peoples Alternative Coalition v. Lim (G.R. No. 119775):** Crucial precedent that partially invalidated Proclamation No. 420.
*   **Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Viron Transportation Co., Inc., G.R. No. 170656, 5 August 2007, 530 SCRA 341, 355:** Outlines the requisites for a Petition for Declaratory Relief.
*   **National Dental Supply Co. v. Meer, 90 Phil. 265 (1951):** Confirms the continuing validity of CA No. 55.
*   **Tanda v. Aldaya, 98 Phil. 244 (1956):** States a court decision cannot be subject to a petition for declaratory relief.
*   **Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. v. Republic, G.R. No. 161140, 31 January 2007, 513 SCRA 562, 569:** Defines what constitutes an "issue [that] must be ripe for judicial determination."
*   **Mangahas v. Paredes, G.R. No. 157866, 14 February 2007, 515 SCRA 709, 716:** Lists what is considered a proper subject matter of a declaratory relief.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied CJH's petition for declaratory relief. The Court considered the remedy to be improper due to CA No. 55, the nature of subject matter, and availability of administrative remedies under the TCC. Furthermore, the Court noted the existence of pending litigation on the same point of law and effectively suggested CJH address the retroactivity issue in that forum.
