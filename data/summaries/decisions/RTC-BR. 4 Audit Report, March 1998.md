## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 95-4-143-RTC

**Case:** Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao del Norte

**Nature:** Administrative matter stemming from a judicial and financial audit revealing irregularities during Judge Tupas' incumbency.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judicial Audit:**
    *   Undecided cases beyond the 90-day reglementary period (Violations of Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct; _Canons of Judicial Ethics_)
    *   Lack of Minutes of Proceedings in unappealed cases.
    *   Improper logging of disposed cases.
    *   Disorganized case records (pleadings not chronologically stitched)
    *   Inadequate inventory management as per Administrative Circular No.1 dated 28 January 1988

*   **Financial Audit (Atty. Ginete, Clerk of Court):**
    *   Shortages in Fiduciary Fund (P12,461.75), Judiciary Development Fund (JDF) (P18,377.25), Clerk of Court General Fund (P6,849.65), and Ex-Officio Sheriff General Fund (P36.00).
    *   Improper handling and delayed remittance of funds, including violations of SC Circular No. 5 of 21 February 1985 and SC Administrative Circular No. 5-93, pertaining to deposit of collections with PNB/LBP.
    *   Unauthorized withdrawals and "borrowings" from court funds (violates COA Audit Memo No. 84-373; _Dioquino v. Martinez_ - misappropriation of trust funds).
    *   Violation of Administrative Circular No. 31-90, pertaining to the Judiciary Development Fund

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Tupas:** Liable for grave misconduct and gross negligence due to mismanagement, failure to decide cases within the mandated timeframe, and borrowing from court funds (violates Rule 5.04, Canon 5, of the Code of Judicial Conduct).  _Garcia v. Teehankee_ establishes a judge's supervisory responsibility.
*   **Atty. Ginete (Clerk of Court):**  Liable for Dishonesty, gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct. Primarily responsible for financial shortages, improper fund handling (violates SC Adm. Circular No. 5-93), and unauthorized withdrawals, exceeding the scope of his responsibilities under the Manual for Clerks of Court, Chapter VII.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge Tupas' Defense:** His denial of borrowing funds is contradicted by evidence (duplicate deposit slip).  His excuse for delayed case decisions is weakened by timing inconsistencies.
*   **Atty. Ginete's Defense:** Excuses (AWOL predecessor, lack of PNB branch, employee maternity leave) are deemed insufficient to justify financial irregularities and procedural violations.  Reliance on personal funds for remittances raises questions regarding proper accounting practices (_Lirios v. Oliveros_ - Clerk of Courtâ€™s undue delay in his JDF remittances).
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Remittance Verification:**  Atty. Ginete's claim that PNB Tagum could provide proof of remittances requires further investigation but is unlikely due to the SC order in place at the time.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct; Canons of Judicial Ethics:** Case Delays
*   **SC Circular No. 5 of 21 February 1985:**  Judiciary Development Fund guidelines.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 31-90:** Requires deposit of JDF funds with PNB
*   **SC Administrative Circular No. 5-93:** Designates the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) as the depositary bank
*   **Rule 5.04, Canon 5, of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Loan from anyone except as may be allowed by law
*    **Administrative Circular No.1 dated 28 January 1988:** Case inventory
*   **COA Audit Memo No. 84-373:** Prohibits the encashment of treasury warrants.
*   _Dioquino v. Martinez_:  Addresses the impropriety of using trust funds for unauthorized expenses.
*   _Garcia v. Teehankee_: Establishes Judge's supervisory responsibilities.
*   _Lirios v. Oliveros_:  Relates to undue delay in JDF remittances.
*   Manual for Clerks of Court.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Tupas: Fined P20,000.
*   Atty. Ginete: Dismissed from service with forfeiture of benefits and ordered to remit P37,724.65 to cover shortages.
*   OCA directed to prepare circulars to prevent future mismanagement.

**Potential Legal Issues:**

*   **Clerk of Court is also the concurrent cashier and disbursement officer:** This creates a potential conflict of interest, as the same person is responsible for collecting, depositing, and disbursing funds.
*   **Lack of Branch designation for Cashier:** Court has no designation in its plantilla of a cashier item, thus making the Clerk of Court personally responsible for the handling of funds
*   **Violation of Commission of Audit regarding the encashment of treasury warrants:** The clerk of court may have engaged in a prohibited practice
