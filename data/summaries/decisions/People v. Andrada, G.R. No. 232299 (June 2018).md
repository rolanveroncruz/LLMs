## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Andrada*, G.R. No. 232299 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA Decision affirming an RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Shabu).

**Holding:** SC *reverses* the CA decision and *acquits* Andrada based on reasonable doubt due to a broken chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs). Accused allegedly sold 0.03 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Chain of Custody:** Critical issue. The SC found significant breaks in the chain, creating reasonable doubt. Specific concerns:
    *   Inconsistency in who delivered the request for lab examination. PO3 Uypala (investigator), but dorsal request shows PO2 Camaclang. *No explanation* for this discrepancy. This creates a gap.
    *   Prosecution *failed to detail* how the specimen was received at the crime lab, identity of recipient, or handling/preservation before examination by FC Dechitan.
    *   Prosecution *failed to address* post-examination custody - who possessed, handled, stored, and safeguarded the specimen pending court presentation. Cites *People v. Coreche*, 612 Phil. 1238 (2009).

*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) Compliance:** Grave lapses in compliance:
    *   Absence of required witnesses (media, DOJ representative, elected official) during inventory and photographing of seized item.
    *   Prosecution failed to acknowledge or justify the non-compliance.  Cites *People v. Sipin*, G.R. No. 224290 (2018), emphasizing the prosecution's burden to explain and prove justifiable grounds for deviations.
    *   Failure to establish any steps taken to preserve integrity despite non-compliance.

**Case Law:**

*   Key cases cited to support the chain of custody doctrine and the importance of strict compliance with Sec. 21: *Mallillin v. People*, 576 Phil. 576 (2008), *People v. Salvador*, 726 Phil. 389 (2014), *People v. Gatlabayan*, 669 Phil. 240 (2011), *People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014).
*   *People v. Sipin*, G.R. No. 224290 (2018):  Prosecution must prove valid cause for non-compliance with Sec. 21 and demonstrate observance in such a way that during trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law. Its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court explicitly rejects the RTC and CA's reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, as the irregular handling of the seized evidence rebuts this presumption. This principle is highlighted for potential future arguments.
*   **Amount of Drug Seized:** Small amount of shabu (0.03 gram) emphasized the need for strictest compliance with chain of custody rules.
*   **Saving Clause:** The Court notes that the saving clause in the IRR of RA 9165 is inapplicable because the prosecution did not acknowledge the lapses and offer justifications.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Court directed the Director of the Bureau of Corrections to immediately release Andrada unless lawfully held for another cause.
*   Prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including the identity and integrity of the seized drug and strict compliance with Sec. 21.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a potent reminder of the critical importance of meticulously adhering to the chain of custody rule and the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 in drug cases, particularly when dealing with small quantities of drugs. The prosecution's failure to adequately explain the gaps and inconsistencies in the handling of the evidence resulted in the accused's acquittal. The court places significant emphasis on documentary evidence and witness testimony to demonstrate the full journey of the evidence, failing which the presumption of innocence prevails.
