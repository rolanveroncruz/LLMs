## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Tomas Dolleton, et al. v. Fil-Estate Management Inc., et al.* G.R. No. 170750

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the dismissal of complaints for quieting of title and recovery of ownership and possession.

**Facts:**
*   Petitioners, claiming continuous possession for over 90 years, filed complaints against Respondents (Fil-Estate, et al.) for forcible eviction from parcels of land in Las Pi√±as.
*   Respondents based their claim on Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) derived from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 6122 in the name of Jose Velasquez.
*   Petitioners allege the TCTs did not cover their specific properties and were spurious. They cited *Vda. de Cailles v. Mayuga* and *Orosa v. Migrino* (involving Lot 9, Psu-11411, Amd-2) to argue their lands were outside that previously adjudicated area.
*   RTC dismissed the complaints based on prescription, laches, lack of cause of action, and res judicata, affirmed by the CA.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners' Claims:** Ownership based on acquisitive prescription, wrongful eviction by Respondents using TCTs purportedly not covering their land. Request for recovery of possession and damages, with an inconsistent prayer for cancellation of Respondent's titles.
*   **Respondents' Claims:** Dismissal based on:
    *   *Prescription:* Alleging actions are for annulment of title/reconveyance and barred by Section 32 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) and Articles 1144 & 1456 of the Civil Code (implied trust).
    *   *Laches:* Petitioners failed to challenge registration despite alleged long possession.
    *   *Lack of Cause of Action:* Possession and tax payments cannot defeat registered title.
    *   *Res Judicata:* Prior cases (*Vda. de Cailles*, *Orosa*) declared Respondent's predecessor as owner of Lot 9, Psu 11411, Amd-2. Also citing the MTC Decision in Civil Case No. 3271.

**Court Holding (Reversed the CA & RTC):**

*   **Cause of Action:** Complaints sufficiently stated a cause of action. The core issue is whether Respondents' titles actually cover Petitioners' properties.
*   **Prescription:** The actions are not for reopening of registration or reconveyance, but more akin to *accion reivindicatoria*, with a 10-year prescriptive period not yet expired. Prescription requires evidence demonstrating that the Respondent's land covers that of the Petitioner.
*   **Laches:**  Premature dismissal. Requires evidence of an opportunity for Petitioners to assert their rights, which is absent if the lands are distinct.
*   **Res Judicata:** Prior cases (*Vda. de Cailles*, *Orosa*) involve Lot 9 Psu-11411 Amd-2, while Petitioners claim their lands are *outside* that area. The MTC decision in Civil Case No. 3271 only determined occupants of land covered by Respondents' titles, not a separate parcel.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistent Prayer for Relief:** Petitioners' prayer to cancel Respondents' TCTs is inconsistent with their claim that the TCTs do not cover their land. This could weaken their overall position and affect the scope of permissible relief.
*   **Factual Dispute:** The case hinges on the *factual determination* of whether Respondents' TCTs encompass the parcels claimed by Petitioners. This requires detailed surveys, boundary descriptions, and potentially expert testimony, a complex and potentially expensive endeavor.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** Petitioners bear the burden of proving their ownership/possessory rights and that Respondents' actions are unlawful. They must demonstrate with concrete evidence that their properties are distinct from that covered by Respondents' titles.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 32:** Relates to the review of a decree of registration based on fraud.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 1144 & 1456:** Imposes a statute of limitations on actions based on obligations created by law (including implied trust).
*   ***Vda. de Cailles v. Mayuga* and *Orosa v. Migrino***:  Cited by both parties, but the Court distinguishes them, stating they pertain to a specific portion of the property in question.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 2, Section 2:** Definition of a cause of action.
*   **Civil Code, Article 428** Rights of ownership.
*   **accion reivindicatoria** Action for recovery of ownership and possession.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court found the dismissal of the complaints premature, emphasizing the need for a trial on the merits to determine the critical factual question of land boundaries and whether the Respondents' TCTs cover the Petitioners' properties. The inconsistent prayer for relief and the evidentiary burden on the Petitioners remain potential weaknesses. Further investigation on the factual circumstances of each plaintiff will be required.
