## Legal Document Summary: Stablewood Philippines, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 206517)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a claim for tax refund or issuance of Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) of creditable withholding tax (CWT) for taxable year (TY) 2005.

**Key Issue:** Whether Stablewood Philippines, Inc. is entitled to a refund of its excess CWT for TY 2005, amounting to PHP 65,085,905.82.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) *En Banc* decision, which upheld the CTA Third Division's ruling denying Stablewood's claim for refund.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 76 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** This section dictates the options for a corporation with overpaid income tax: carry-over as tax credit or apply for a refund/TCC.  It also contains the "irrevocability rule," stating that once the carry-over option is chosen, it is irrevocable for that taxable period.
*   **Corporation's choice:** Stablewood initially marked "To be issued a Tax Credit Certificate" on its 2005 Annual ITR.
*   **Corporation's actions:** Stablewood subsequently carried over the overpayment to its Quarterly Income Tax Returns for the first, second, and third quarters of TY 2006, and subsequently filed an administrative claim for refund on November 24, 2006.
*   **Irrevocability Rule:** Stablewood's act of carrying over the excess CWT to subsequent quarters constituted an irrevocable election of the carry-over option under Section 76 of the NIRC, precluding a later claim for refund, irrespective of whether the CWT was actually utilized. The court emphasized that the option chosen by the taxpayer is a matter of evidence, and can go beyond what is indicated in the Annual ITR.
*   **Dissolution Argument:** Stablewood argued that the irrevocability rule should not apply because it was in the process of dissolution and could no longer utilize the CWT.  The Court rejected this, because Stablewood was not fully dissolved at that time, and also because they had the opportunity to carry-over the CWT prior to the dissolution.
*   **Sections 52(C) and 235 of the NIRC:** The CTA EB had previously invoked that under these sections, a corporation contemplating dissolution must secure a tax clearance certificate from the BIR and submit it to the SEC before the issuance of a certificate of dissolution. The Supreme Court did not rule on the necessity of these sections because the Court ruled that because Stablewood made an irrevocable choice to carry-over its unutilized CWT, it cannot be refunded.

**Liabilities:**

*   Stablewood is liable for the tax deficiency as the claimed refund was denied.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Claims:** The decision sets a precedent that taxpayers cannot claim a refund of excess CWT if they have previously elected to carry over the excess, even if the carry-over option was not fully utilized and/or the corporation subsequently dissolves.
*   **Procedural Compliance:** Strict adherence to the requirements of Section 76 of the NIRC is crucial for corporations managing excess CWT.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), Sections 76, 52(C), 235, 204(C), and 229:** These sections are central to the determination of the taxpayer's options, obligations, and rights regarding overpaid taxes and the process for claiming refunds or TCCs.
*   **Systra Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 560 Phil. 261 (2007):**  Cited extensively regarding the irrevocability rule of the carry-over option under Section 76 of the NIRC and the potential for a refund upon permanent cessation of operations.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, 609 Phil. 678 (2009):** Allows the Court to go beyond the option provided under the taxpayer's Annual ITR and take into consideration the evidence submitted by the parties and the circumstances surrounding the taxpayer's option to carry over or claim for refund.
*   **IMPSA Construction Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, CTA EB No. 685:** Requires a taxpayer to prove that the termination of its business operation is permanent in nature and not merely temporary.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 68 (Corporation Code):** Provides the requirements for voluntary dissolution.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of the irrevocability rule under Section 76 of the NIRC, specifically whether "carrying over" the excess tax credit by filling out the "prior Year's Excess Tax Credits" portion on the quarterly returns constitutes an irrevocable choice, regardless of actual utilization.
*   The timing and the necessity of securing a BIR tax clearance certificate under Sections 52(C) and 235 in claiming a refund of unutilized CWT following corporate dissolution in light of the irrevocability rule.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court ruled against Stablewood, denying its claim for a refund of excess CWT. The Court determined that Stablewood's actions in carrying over the excess credit in its quarterly tax returns constituted an irrevocable election, despite its initial selection on the annual return and the subsequent dissolution proceedings. This ruling underscores the importance of precise compliance with Section 76 of the NIRC and the binding nature of a corporation's election to carry-over excess CWT. The irrevocability applies even if the tax credits are not ultimately utilized, and it precludes a refund. The Court found that the administrative claim for refund had occurred after Stablewood had already carried over its tax credits for TY 2005 to the first three quarters of TY 2006, and that Stablewood only stated that it did not carry over its excess CWT for TY 2005 on its TY 2006 documents after it had already filed the administrative claim for refund. This was considered an attempt to belatedly create evidence or a basis that would support its claim for refund, which is not allowed under the rule that a refund is construed against the party claiming the refund and in favor of the taxing power.
