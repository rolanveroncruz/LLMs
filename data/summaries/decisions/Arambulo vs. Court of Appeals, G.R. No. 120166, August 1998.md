**Legal Document Summary: Arambulo v. Court of Appeals and Flores**

This Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 120166, August 3, 1998), Kapunan, J., reverses the Court of Appeals (CA) decision and reinstates the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision, finding a deed of sale to be null and void.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership of land covered by TCT No. NT-21357, originally in the name of Dominador Arambulo, which was allegedly transferred to Flora Flores via a deed of sale.
*   **Core Issue:** Validity of the Deed of Absolute Sale purportedly executed by Arambulo in favor of Flores.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC declared the Deed of Absolute Sale null and void, finding it to be falsified. It also found that the petition for issuance of a second owner’s duplicate copy of the title filed by Flores, the order by the court and the clerk of court’s certification to be fictitious.
*   **CA Ruling:** While upholding the RTC's finding that Flores' supporting documents were spurious, the CA reversed the RTC, declared the Deed of Absolute Sale valid, and cancelled TCT No. NT-187175 issued in the name of respondent Flora Flores.
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC reversed the CA. The court agreed with the RTC’s conclusion that the deed of sale was a forgery, mainly because there was no original document presented to the court but merely a photocopy from the file of the Register of Deeds of Nueva Ecija where the deed of sale was supposedly registered. The SC ruled that since the petitioner specifically questioned the validity of the deed of sale, the burden was upon the respondent to prove its genuineness. Also, the decision to register the transfer happened only 5 years after its creation (1979), thereby raising doubt as to the transaction’s validity.

**Obligations:**

*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligated to cancel TCT No. NT-187175 (Flores) and issue a new title in the name of Arambulo.
*   **Flora Flores:** Obligated to surrender the second owner’s copy of TCT No. NT-187175 for cancellation.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential criminal liability for Flores or others involved in the creation of the spurious documents. The CA directed the Provincial Prosecutor of Nueva Ecija to investigate the falsified court order and clerk's certification.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Forgery:** The SC relied heavily on the combination of the spurious supporting documents, discrepancies in the deed (incorrect address, tax account number), and the absence of evidence from Flores to support the deed's authenticity.
*   **Non-Presentation of Original Deed:** The failure of Flores to present the original deed of sale was critical.
*   **Possession and Taxation:** The SC emphasized that while not proof of ownership, the payment of taxes is at best, an indicum of possession in the concept of ownership.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Joson vs. Baltazar, 194 SCRA 114 – Notarization of a private document into public one and renders it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity.
*   Sales vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. no. 40145 – A notarial acknowledgment attaches full faith and credit to the document concerned.
*   Republic v. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 223 – Payment of taxes is not proof of ownership, it is at best, an indicum of possession in the concept of ownership.

**Ambiguities:**
*   While not explicitly stated, the decision hints at the possibility that the land might have been transferred to Rosalinda Tiongco. However, Tiongco was not a party to the case and therefore any judgement will have no bearing on the outcome.

**Legal Precision & Implications:**

*   The decision reinforces the principle that a party alleging forgery need not present conclusive proof, but rather a preponderance of evidence which calls into question the document's authenticity. The burden then shifts to the proponent to prove validity. The SC highlights the importance of presenting original documents and the consequences of failing to do so when authenticity is challenged.
