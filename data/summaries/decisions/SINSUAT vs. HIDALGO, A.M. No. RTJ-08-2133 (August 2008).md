**Case Summary: *Datu Omar S. Sinsuat and Mariano H. Paps vs. Judge Vicente A. Hidalgo***

**A.M. No. RTJ-08-2133, August 6, 2008**

**Nature:** Administrative case against a retired RTC judge for Grave Misconduct and Gross Ignorance of the Law.

**Facts:**

*   Complainants filed a Motion to Resolve questioning Judge Hidalgo's issuance of a TRO and preliminary injunction in a civil case involving PNOC-EDC, enjoining a bidding for wooden poles related to a government infrastructure project ("O-Ilaw" Project).
*   Complainants alleged that the TRO and injunction violated P.D. No. 1818, R.A. No. 8975, and Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 11-2000, which prohibit such orders against government infrastructure projects.
*   Complainants cited instances suggesting bias against PNOC-EDC, including declaring PNOC-EDC in default and disqualifying their counsel.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) granted a petition for certiorari (CA-G.R. No. 83144), finding that Judge Hidalgo gravely abused his discretion in issuing the TRO/preliminary injunction, violating R.A. 8975 and P.D. 1818.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Violation of P.D. No. 1818 and R.A. No. 8975:** These statutes explicitly prohibit lower courts from issuing TROs and preliminary injunctions against government infrastructure projects. The issuance of the TRO directly contravenes these provisions.
*   **SC Administrative Circular No. 11-2000:** Reinforces the prohibition under the statutes, clarifying the judiciary's stance on such matters.
*   **Jurisdiction Over Retired Judge:** Despite Judge Hidalgo's retirement, the administrative proceeding commenced *prior* to his retirement, thus preserving the Court's jurisdiction.
*   **Due Process:** Judge Hidalgo claimed denial of due process. The Court found this argument unavailing, emphasizing he was informed of the allegations and responded to them. While the initial complaint was unverified, it was treated as an anonymous complaint, and the allegations were verifiable from court records.
*   **Rule 140, Rules of Court:** Outlines the procedure for disciplinary actions against judges.  The case was initiated through an anonymous complaint, permissible where allegations are easily verifiable.
*   **Gross Misconduct and Gross Ignorance of Law:**  The Court held Judge Hidalgo liable for both, constituting serious charges under Section 8 of Rule 140.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Gov. Garcia v. Hon. Burgos, 353 Phil. 740 (1998); National Housing Authority v. Hon. Allarde, 376 Phil. 147 (1999); Atty. Caguioa v. Judge Lavi√±a, 398 Phil. 845 (2000):** These cases reiterate the prohibition in P.D. No. 1818 and highlight that violating this prohibition constitutes grave misconduct. Gonzales v. Judge Hidalgo, 449 Phil. 336 (2003) and Republic v. Hidalgo, December 9, 2005, 477 SCRA 32 were also mentioned which show previous cases where Judge Hidalgo was found administratively liable.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Hidalgo was found guilty of gross misconduct and gross ignorance of the law. Given his retirement, he was fined P40,000, to be deducted from his retirement benefits, pursuant to Section 11 of Rule 140.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The main risk revolved around the potential due process violation claim.  The Court adequately addressed this by demonstrating sufficient notification and opportunity for response.
*   There are no obvious ambiguities. The facts are clearly presented, the statutory provisions are clear in their prohibition, and the judge's actions directly contravened them.

**Conclusion:**

The case confirms the strict prohibition against enjoining government infrastructure projects and underscores the high standard of legal knowledge expected of judges.  The decision emphasizes that retirement does not shield a judge from administrative liability for actions committed during their service. The penalty reflects the serious nature of the offenses, particularly disregarding clear statutory mandates and established jurisprudence.
