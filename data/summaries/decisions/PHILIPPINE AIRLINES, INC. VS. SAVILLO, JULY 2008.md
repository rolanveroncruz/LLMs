**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Hon. Adriano Savillo and Simplicio Griño*, G.R. No. 149547, July 4, 2008**

**Case Overview:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed the RTC's denial of Philippine Airlines (PAL)'s Motion to Dismiss. The underlying suit involves a Complaint for Damages filed by Simplicio Griño (respondent) against PAL and Singapore Airlines (Civil Case No. 23773) for an incident during international air travel. Griño alleges breach of contract and negligence resulting in humiliation, distress, and inability to participate in a golf tournament.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** PAL contracted to transport Griño from Manila to Singapore, with Singapore Airlines to handle the Singapore-Jakarta leg.
*   **Duty of Care:** PAL had a duty to ensure proper endorsement of Griño's tickets for the Singapore Airlines flight. The failure to do so, leading to denial of boarding, forms the basis of Griño's claim.
*   **Warsaw Convention Applicability:** The central issue is whether the Warsaw Convention's two-year statute of limitations bars Griño's claim. Article 29 of the Warsaw Convention specifies a two-year prescriptive period for actions for damages arising from international air transportation. Articles 19 and 24 also address carrier liability.
*   **Civil Code Torts:** Griño's complaint also alleges tortious acts by PAL leading to emotional harm, potentially falling under Articles 19, 21 and 2176 of the Civil Code, which has a four-year prescriptive period under Article 1146.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PAL's Potential Liability:** PAL faces potential liability for breach of contract and for quasi-delict based on negligence. If PAL failed to properly endorse the ticket, leading to the denial of boarding, it may be held liable for Griño's damages.
*   **Singapore Airlines' Potential Liability:** While named in the suit, the summary doesn't specify Singapore Airlines' actions. Their potential liability hinges on specific evidence presented.
*   **Damage Caps:** The Warsaw Convention, if applicable, imposes damage caps on air carrier liability. However, the Court distinguished between claims covered by the Warsaw Convention and those arising from local laws.
*   **Risk of Litigation:** Even if PAL ultimately prevails, it faces costs associated with defending the lawsuit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Warsaw Convention (Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air):** Article 29 (statute of limitations), Articles 19 and 24 (liability for delays). *Mapa v. Court of Appeals, 341 Phil. 281, 295-296 (1997)* cited regarding the Philippine's adherence to the convention.
*   **Philippine Civil Code:** Articles 19, 21, 2176 (torts, quasi-delicts); Article 1146 (four-year prescriptive period for quasi-delicts); Article 1144 (ten-year prescriptive period for written contracts).
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *United Airlines v. Uy, 376 Phil. 688 (1999):*  Distinguished between baggage damage (Warsaw Convention) and humiliation (Civil Code).
    *   *Mahaney v. Air France, 474 F. Supp. 532:*  Distinguished between damages due to delay (Warsaw Convention) and unjust discrimination (not covered by Warsaw Convention).
    *   *Wolgel v. Mexicana Airlines, 821 F. 2d 442:*  "Bumping off" damages fall outside Warsaw Convention.
    *   *Lathigra v. British Airways, 41 F. 3d 535:* Negligence not in performance of contract of carriage, but prior.
*   **Rule 16, Section 1(f) of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for Motion to Dismiss based on the Statute of Limitations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Warsaw Convention:** The primary point of contention is whether the Warsaw Convention exclusively governs the relationship between the passenger and the air carrier or whether the Civil Code of the Philippines could apply.
*   **Cause of Action:** Whether Griño's cause of action stems from a breach of contract covered by the Warsaw Convention or from tortious acts governed by the Civil Code. This distinction affects the applicable statute of limitations.
*   **Determination of Prescription:**  The court emphasizes that if there is doubt as to whether prescription has occurred, deferring action on a motion to dismiss until after trial on the merits is prudent (*Sison v. McQuaid, 94 Phil 201, 203-204 (1953), Cordova v. Cordova, 102 Phil 1182 (1958)*).

**Conclusion:**

The Court ultimately denied PAL's petition, holding that Griño's claims for emotional distress, anxiety, and humiliation resulting from the denial of boarding potentially fall outside the scope of the Warsaw Convention and are therefore governed by the Civil Code's four-year prescriptive period for quasi-delicts. Since Griño filed his complaint within four years of PAL receiving his demand letter, his claims are not time-barred.
