## Legal Document Summary: *National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Dennis Coo*

**Case Citation:** 354 Phil. 936 (G.R. No. 122195, July 23, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in a replevin case.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership/possession of assorted scrap aluminum wires and allied accessories initially seized by the PC from Dennis Coo, acquitted of anti-fencing. NPC subsequently took possession of the goods.
*   **Prior Criminal Proceeding:** Coo was acquitted in a criminal case for violation of anti-fencing law. The acquittal, although based on reasonable doubt, establishes his entitlement to the return of the property. See *Heirs of Carlos Caballero v. Solano*, 243 SCRA 660 (1995).
*   **Replevin Action:** Coo filed a replevin action against NPC to recover the seized items. He obtained possession after posting a bond.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Coo, declaring him the owner and possessor.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's decision, but absolved individual NPC officers from personal liability and deleted compensatory/moral damages, instead awarding nominal damages and attorney's fees to Coo.
*   **NPC's Argument:** Challenges CA reliance on the acquittal, arguing it's not conclusive on ownership. Claims discrepancies in description/weight of goods in the sales invoice vs. seized property. Alleges exclusive use of the aluminum wires by NPC and low purchase price by the plaintiff.
*   **Coo's Argument:** Contests factual allegations, asserts the issues raised by the petitioners are factual and insubstantial.
*   **Article 2221**: States the basis for the award of nominal damages.
*   **Article 2208 (2) and (5)**: Provides for the instances where attorney's fees should be awarded.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **NPC's Obligation:** To return the property to Coo and pay nominal damages and attorney's fees. The refusal to return the property after Coo's acquittal and claim of ownership, is considered a violation of his rights.
*   **Liability Basis:** Wrongful withholding of property after determination of Coo's entitlement, justifying award of nominal damages to vindicate Coo's rights. Bad faith in refusing to satisfy a valid claim justifies attorney's fees. Civil Code, Art. 2208 (2,5).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Evidence:** The core dispute hinges on conflicting factual claims regarding the identity and description of the seized goods versus the goods covered by Coo's purchase documents. The Supreme Court defers to the factual findings of the lower courts. *Valenzuela v. Court of Appeals, 252 SCRA 303 (1996).*
*   **Evidence of Ownership vs. Possession:** The ruling emphasizes that in a replevin action, proof of entitlement to legal possession is sufficient, not necessarily proof of absolute ownership. *Paat v. Court of Appeals, 266 SCRA 185 (1997).*
*   **Weight of Criminal Acquittal:** The acquittal in the criminal case, though not precluding a civil action, is considered probative evidence supporting Coo's claim.
* **Exclusive Access to the product:** The court of appeals found that NPC conducts public biddings, implying it does not have exclusive access to the material in question.

**Key Legal Issues:**

*   Sufficiency of evidence in a replevin action to prove entitlement to possession.
*   Effect of a criminal acquittal based on reasonable doubt on a subsequent civil action.
*   Propriety of awarding nominal damages and attorney's fees.
*   Weight given to factual findings of lower courts by the Supreme Court.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals' decision, requiring NPC to return the property to Coo and pay nominal damages and attorney's fees. The Court found no palpable errors in the CA's appreciation of the facts.
