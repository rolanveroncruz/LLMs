**Legal Document Summary: *Hon. Dennis Patrick Z. Perez v. Almira L. Roxas***

**Case:** A.M. No. P-16-3595, June 26, 2018 (Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 15-4446-P)

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Hon. Dennis Patrick Z. Perez, Presiding Judge, Branch 67, Regional Trial Court, Binangonan, Rizal.
*   **Respondent:** Almira L. Roxas, Clerk III, Branch 67, Regional Trial Court, Binangonan, Rizal.

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative Complaint for grave misconduct, dishonesty, violation of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), and CSC Memorandum Circular 13, s. 2007 (Absences Without Approved Leave). This arises from a counter-complaint by Judge Perez after Roxas filed a separate administrative complaint against him.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **AWOL:** Roxas was absent without leave (AWOL) from October 14, 2013. A prior Resolution (A.M. No. 14-6-192-RTC) already dropped her from the rolls for being AWOL, effective October 15, 2013.
*   **Admission of Receiving Money:** Roxas admitted to receiving money from bondsmen, ostensibly for a "common fund" in the office. This admission is crucial to the finding of grave misconduct.
*   **Performance Ratings:** Judge Perez presented evidence that Roxas had consistently received low performance ratings due to inefficiency, insubordination, and attitude problems.
*   **"Common Practice" Defense:** Roxas' defense that receiving money from bondsmen was a "common practice" in the office was rejected by the Court.
* **Loans:** Judge Perez highlights Roxas' outstanding loans with the Supreme Court Savings and Loan Association, Inc. (SCSLAI), seeking to freeze any benefits to cover these debts.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation of Court Personnel:** The document reiterates the high standards of ethical conduct required of court personnel, citing Section 2, Canon I and Section 2(e), Canon III of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel.
*   **Liability for Grave Misconduct:** Roxas is found guilty of Grave Misconduct based on her admission of receiving money from bondsmen. The Court emphasized in Cabauatan v. Uvero that government employees and officials cannot receive any voluntary monetary considerations from any party in relation to the performance of their duties.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Common Practice" as Mitigation:** Roxas attempted to mitigate her actions by claiming the practice of receiving money was common. *Cabauatan v. Uvero*, A.M. No. P-15-3329, is used to reject this argument, highlighting the Court's zero-tolerance policy.
*   **Penalty Enforcement:** Because Roxas was already dropped from the rolls for AWOL, the penalty of dismissal could not be imposed. However, the administrative disabilities associated with dismissal (forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from government re-employment) *were* applied.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (mentioned but not directly applied).
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular 13, s. 2007:** (Absences Without Approved Leave)
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel:** Specifically Section 2, Canon I and Section 2(e), Canon III.
*   ***Cabauatan v. Uvero*, A.M. No. P-15-3329:** Crucial precedent condemning the "common practice" defense in corruption cases.
*   ***Judge Domingo-Regala v. Sultan*, 492 Phil. 482, 490-491 (2005):** No other office in the government service exacts a greater demand for moral righteousness and uprightness from an employee than the Judiciary.
*    ***Alano v. Sahi*, 745 Phil. 385, 395 (2014):** Duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a true temple of justice.
*   ***Ramos vs. Limeta*, 650 Phil. 243, 248-249 (2010):** Definition of grave misconduct.
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service (RURACCS)**: Cited regarding classification of grave offenses and administrative disabilities.

**Outcome:**

Almira L. Roxas is found GUILTY of Grave Misconduct. While dismissal is not possible due to her prior AWOL status, she suffers:

1.  Forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits.
2.  Perpetual disqualification from re-employment in any government agency or instrumentality.

**Legal Analysis and Conclusion:**

The Court's decision is primarily driven by Roxas' admission of receiving money from bondsmen, regardless of her purported intent or the "common practice" defense. *Cabauatan v. Uvero* provides strong support for this position. The penalty reflects the seriousness of the misconduct, even though Roxas was already separated from service for a different reason.
