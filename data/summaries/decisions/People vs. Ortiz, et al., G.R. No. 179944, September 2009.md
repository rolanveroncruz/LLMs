Here's a legal summary of *People v. Ortiz, et al.* (G.R. No. 179944):

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, convicting Antonio Ortiz, Charito Chavez, and Edwin Dasilio of Robbery with Rape under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659. The crime stemmed from an incident on April 22, 2000, where the appellants, along with Jerry Doe (at large), robbed the residence of BBB and AAA, and subsequently raped AAA.

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **Crime:** Robbery with Rape (Art. 294(1), RPC). Requires: (1) Taking of personal property with violence or intimidation; (2) Property belongs to another; (3) *Animus lucrandi* (intent to gain); (4) Robbery accompanied by rape.
*   **Positive Identification:** The victims positively identified the appellants.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Failure to object to the presentation of the calculator (identified as stolen property) as evidence during trial constitutes a waiver of objection. (Sec. 36, Rule 132, Revised Rules on Evidence)
*   **Credibility of Victim Testimony:** Victim's testimony deemed credible, with the Court emphasizing that a rape victim's declaration is often sufficient if credible, absent improper motive (citing *People v. Llanita*). Crying during testimony also strengthens credibility.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** Disregarded due to positive identification by the victims and failure to prove physical impossibility of being at the scene of the crime (citing *People v. Bracero*). The *onus probandi* remains with the prosecution.

**Obligations:**

*   **Reparation:** Appellants are obligated to pay damages to the victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Appellants were found guilty of Robbery with Rape.
*   **Civil Liability:** Liable for actual, moral, exemplary, and civil indemnity.

**Damages:**

*   **Civil Indemnity:** Increased from P50,000 to P75,000 due to circumstances warranting the death penalty (use of firearms, superior number). Citing *People v. Jabiniao, Jr.*
*   **Actual Damages:** P28,082.00 (value of stolen items)
*   **Moral Damages:** P200,000.00 (P50,000.00 for each act of rape, including that of Jerry Doe).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P25,000.00

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness Testimony:** While the Court heavily relied on the victim's testimony, scrutinizing such testimony, especially in the context of multiple acts of rape, can be a contentious area. Defense attorneys often challenge such testimony by highlighting inconsistencies.
*   **Afterthought argument of calculator testimony:** The calculator being introduced as an afterthought was argued to undermine the case.
*   **Parole:** Under R.A. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty), the sentence was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Article 294(1) (Robbery with Rape).
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amends Article 294, RPC
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
