Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Norlina G. Sibayan v. Elizabeth O. Alda* G.R. No. 233395, January 17, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the BSP's denial of petitioner's (Sibayan) request for modes of discovery in an administrative case.

**Facts:**

*   Elizabeth Alda (through attorney-in-fact Ruby Alda) filed a complaint with the BSP against Norlina Sibayan (BDO Assistant Manager) for unauthorized deductions from Elizabeth's BDO Savings Account and failure to post certain check deposits.
*   Sibayan alleges this is in retaliation for BDO's criminal case against Elizabeth and Ruby for theft, estafa, and violation of R.A. 8484 (Access Device Regulation Act) related to erroneous credits to Ruby's Fastcard account and subsequent withdrawals.
*   BDO claims Ruby withdrew amounts far exceeding remittances, laundering the money through various accounts, including Elizabeth's.
*   BDO, relying on documents (Undertaking, SPA, and Dation in Payment) executed by Ruby, debited Elizabeth's account and applied it to Ruby's debt. Documents also listed accounts of Ferdinand and Jovelyn Oriente
*   The OSI-BSP found prima facie case against Sibayan under Section 56.2 of R.A. 8791 (General Banking Law) for Conducting Business in an Unsafe or Unsound Manner, punishable under Section 37 of R.A. 7653 (New Central Bank Act).
*   Sibayan requested written interrogatories to Elizabeth, Jovelyn, and Ferdinand, and sought a Motion for Production of Documents to compel UCPB and BPI to produce statements for accounts allegedly owned by Ruby, but standing in the name of Ferdinand and Jovelyn Oriente.
*   BSP denied the request, arguing Elizabeth, Jovelyn, and Ferdinand were prosecution witnesses and further discovery would delay the proceedings. The Motion for Production was denied based on the Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits. The administrative action wasn't the "subject matter of the litigation".
* CA upheld BSP's ruling, noting proceedings were summary and information was sufficiently contained in the pleadings.

**Issue:** Whether the BSP committed grave abuse of discretion in denying Sibayan's resort to modes of discovery.

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the BSP.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Administrative Proceedings & Rules of Procedure:** Administrative proceedings are summary in nature and not strictly bound by technical rules of procedure and evidence applicable to judicial trials. Cites *Oriental Shipmanagement Co., Inc. v. Bastol,* and *Securities and Exchange Commission v. Interport Resources Corporation* for the principle that administrative proceedings need not adhere strictly to the Rules of Court. Reference made to Section 3, Rule 1 of the BSP Rules of Procedure on Administrative Cases.
*   **Modes of Discovery:** Recourse to discovery procedures under the Rules of Court is not mandatory in BSP administrative proceedings. Allowing the requested discovery would delay the proceedings.
*   **Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits (R.A. 1405):** The bank accounts sought to be examined are privileged. The documents executed by Ruby did not grant permission to examine the bank accounts of Ferdinand and Jovelyn Oriente.
*   **Due Process:** Sibayan was afforded due process by being given the opportunity to be heard and submit evidence. Administrative due process does not require a formal trial-type hearing. Cites *Prudential Bank v. Rapanot*.
*   Clarificatory hearings under Section 7 of the BSP Rules of Procedure on Administrative Cases may be conducted.

**Obligations:**

*   Sibayan had an obligation to adhere to the summary nature of the BSP administrative proceedings.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential administrative liability for Sibayan under Section 56.2 of R.A. 8791.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Continued administrative action against Sibayan.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8484:** Access Device Regulation Act of 1998
*   **R.A. 8791:** General Banking Law of 2000, Section 56.2 (Conducting Business in an Unsafe or Unsound Manner)
*   **R.A. 7653:** New Central Bank Act, Section 37 (Penalties)
*   **R.A. 1405:** Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits, Section 2.
*   *Geronimo v. Spouses Calderon*
*   *Tacloban II Neighborhood Association, Inc. v. Office of the President*
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Indar*
*   *Oriental Shipmanagement Co., Inc. v. Bastol*
*   *Securities and Exchange Commission v. Interport Resources Corporation*
*   *Prudential Bank v. Rapanot*
*   *Barcelona v. Lim*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "subject matter of the litigation" exception to the Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits. The BSP interpreted this narrowly, finding that an administrative proceeding is not considered the "subject matter of litigation." This interpretation is detrimental to Sibayan.
*   The validity and enforceability of Ruby Alda's documents (Undertaking, SPA, Dation in Payment) as they pertain to bank accounts not in her name.

**Overall:**

The case highlights the limited scope of discovery available in BSP administrative proceedings and reinforces the principle that technical rules of procedure are not strictly applied. The Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits is a significant hurdle to accessing financial information, even when related to alleged fraudulent activities. Sibayan's arguments regarding due process were unsuccessful, as the Court found she was given sufficient opportunity to be heard. It seems highly unlikely that Sibayan will be able to force the BSP to allow her the right to discovery procedures. However, the success of her defense will likely hinge on the BSP's ability to obtain information that may be privileged due to the Law on Secrecy of Bank Deposits, and how the BSP views the Undertaking, SPA, and Deed of Dation in Payment of Ruby.
