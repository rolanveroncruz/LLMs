## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 15-11-01-SC

**Case Name:** Re: Application for Optional Retirement of Associate Justice Martin S. Villarama, Jr.

**Citation:** 827 Phil. 152 (2018)

**Nature:** Supreme Court Resolution regarding the computation of longevity pay for a retiring Associate Justice.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 910, RA 5095, RA 9946:** Retirement benefits laws governing the application.
*   **BP Blg. 129, Sec. 42:** Grants monthly longevity pay to justices and judges of certain courts (excluding Supreme Court initially) equivalent to 5% of basic monthly pay for each 5-year period of continuous, efficient, and meritorious service in the judiciary.
*   **AC No. 58-2003:** Allows tacking of earned leave credits to judicial service for purposes of increasing longevity pay of justices and judges *upon compulsory retirement*.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether AC No. 58-2003, allowing the tacking of earned leave credits, applies to justices who *optionally* retire and whether a fraction of a five-year period can be considered in the calculation.
2.  Whether service as Bar Examiner by an incumbent member of the judiciary is creditable towards longevity pay.

**Ruling:**

1.  **AC No. 58-2003 Applies to Optional Retirees:** The Court held that AC No. 58-2003 applies to both compulsory *and optional* retirees. The intent of BP Blg. 129, Sec. 42 is to reward loyalty and long service in the judiciary, regardless of the type of retirement. The restriction of AC No. 58-2003 to compulsory retirees was deemed erroneous.
2.  **Fractional Longevity Pay Allowed:**  The Court allowed the computation of longevity pay to include the fractional percentage of the unexpired five-year period immediately preceding retirement and further provides that two (2) years and six (6) months will be considered as one whole 5 year cycle. For those below the threshold above, the adjustment of the computation of additional longevity pay will be an additional one percent (1%) for every year of service in the judiciary.
3.  **Bar Examiner Service Not Creditable:**  Service as Bar Examiner *while already* a member of the judiciary is *not* creditable towards longevity pay. The Court distinguished this from service as a Bar Examiner *prior* to appointment to the judiciary. A.M. No. 08-12-7-SC only covers pre-appointment service.

**Obligations:**

*   The Court *directs* that Justice Villarama be paid his longevity pay, including tacked leave credits, excluding his service as Bar Examiner.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly stated. The ruling clarifies the proper computation of retirement benefits under existing laws.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactivity/Applicability to other retirees:** The ruling aims to set a precedent, but individual cases might arise requiring specific factual assessment.
*   **Interpretation of "Continuous, Efficient, and Meritorious Service":** While the Court rejected the DBM's interpretation requiring "actual" service, further disputes could arise regarding what constitutes "efficient and meritorious" service, potentially requiring litigation.
*   **DBM Compliance:**  Past issues with the DBM's initial resistance to AC No. 58-2003 (referenced in *Re: Computation of Longevity Pay Upon Compulsory Retirement, 561 Phil. 491 (2007)*) indicate a potential risk of resistance to the implementation of this Resolution.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 (BP Blg. 129), Section 42**: Primary legal basis for longevity pay.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1927:** Corrected the gap of including Supreme Court justices/judges.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 58-2003 (AC No. 58-2003):** Key circular allowing tacking of leave credits for compulsory retirees.
*   **A.M. No. 03-9-20-SC:** The case that led to AC No. 58-2003, involving Justice Bellosillo.
*   **A.M. No. 08-12-7-SC:**  Related to crediting service as Bar Examiner.
*   ***Re: Letter of Court of Appeals Justice Vicente S.E. Veloso for Entitlement to Longevity Pay for his Services as Commission Member III of the National Labor Relations Commission, A.M. No. 12-8-07-CA, 26 July 2016, 798 SCRA 179.*** Discussion on issues of judicial legislation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Pro Hac Vice (Historically)**: The court distances this application from any *pro hac vice* applications historically made. This means in similar cases a justice may point to this ruling as a precedent.

**Conclusion:**

This Resolution significantly expands the scope of AC No. 58-2003 to include optional retirees, ensuring fairer computation of longevity pay. However, the denial of credit for Bar Examiner service during judicial tenure and the potential for DBM resistance remain relevant considerations.  Litigation could arise over the practical application and calculation of fractional longevity pay, especially concerning compliance with the set rounding off principles..
