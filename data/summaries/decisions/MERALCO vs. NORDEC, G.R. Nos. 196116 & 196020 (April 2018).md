## Legal Document Summary: *Meralco v. Nordec Philippines* (G.R. Nos. 196020 & 196116)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision regarding damages arising from the disconnection of electricity.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Manila Electric Company (Meralco), Vicente Montero, Mr. Bondoc, and Mr. Bayona
*   **Respondent:** Nordec Philippines and/or Marvex Industrial Corp.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Alleged Meter Tampering:** Meralco claimed Marvex (later Nordec) tampered with electric meters, leading to differential billing.
*   **Disconnection:** Meralco disconnected Nordec's electric supply for non-payment of the assessed differential billing.
*   **Notice of Disconnection:** Adequacy of notice before disconnection. Meralco argues demand letters sufficed; Nordec claims lack of 48-hour written notice as required by Revised General Order No. 1, Section 97.
*   **Contractual Relationship:** Whether Nordec, as the subsequent owner of Marvex, had a contractual relationship with Meralco. The Court of Appeals found an implied contract, with Nordec stepping into the shoes of Marvex as assignee or successor-in-interest. Meralco disputes this.
*   **Negligence of Meralco:** The Court of Appeals found Meralco negligent in the delayed discovery of the alleged tampering and its failure to correct the defect.
*   **Damages:** Nordec claimed actual/temperate damages for business losses, moral damages for damage to reputation, and exemplary damages. The Court of Appeals awarded P5,625.00 refund, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, but no actual damages.

**Court's Holding:**

The Court denies both petitions, affirming the Court of Appeals decision, **but modifies it**. The Court of Appeals erred in awarding exemplary damages and attorney's fees because Nordec did not prove it was entitled to moral, temperate, or compensatory damages. Awards are deleted.

*   **P5,625.00 Refund:** Affirmed, representing overbilling.
*   **Nominal Damages:** Awarded P30,000.00 to Nordec to vindicate their rights violated by Meralco's negligent disconnection without proper notice.
*   **Exemplary Damages and Attorney's Fees:** Deleted, as the court found the pre-requisite of proof of entitlement to moral, temperate, or compensatory damages was not satisfied.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised General Order No. 1, Section 97:** 48-hour written notice required before disconnection for non-payment.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 349:** Pertains to the testing required of meters and appliances for measurements used by all public services by a standardized meter laboratory under the control of the then Public Service Commission. (Not inspections required of distribution utilities).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 401, as amended:** Regarding illegal use of electricity (relevant to the alleged tampering).
*   **Civil Code, Article 2234:** Requires proof of entitlement to moral, temperate or compensatory damages before exemplary damages may be awarded.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2224:** Defines temperate or moderate damages.
*   ***Ridjo Tape & Chemical Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, 350 Phil. 184 (1998):** Establishes a public utility's duty to inspect and maintain equipment, and the consequences of negligence.
*   **Manila Electric Co. v. Macro Textile Mills Corp., 424 Phil. 811 (2002):**
*   **Manila Electric Co. v. Wilcon Builders Supply, Inc., 579 Phil. 214 (2008):**
*   **Manila Electric Company v. T.E.A.M. Electronics Corp., 564 Phil. 639 (2007):** Relates to prior findings of tampering and negligence in failing to repair defects.
*   **Manila Electric Company v. Spouses Chua, 637 Phil. 80 (2010):**
*   **Seven Brothers Shipping Corporation v. DMC-Construction Resources, Inc., 748 Phil. 692 (2014):**

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Tampering:** The core dispute revolves around the validity of Meralco's claim of meter tampering. The evidence presented, its admissibility, and its persuasiveness will be crucial.
*   **Implied Contract:** Meralco could argue that the elements for an implied contract were not met.
*   **Damages:** The main issue is whether Nordec can establish a causal link between the disconnection and quantifiable business losses to potentially recover at least nominal damages. However, since Nordec failed to prove actual or temperate damages, an award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees would not be proper.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court largely affirmed the Court of Appeal's finding of negligence on the part of Meralco in disconnecting Nordec's electricity. However, since Nordec was not able to adduce proof of actual or temperate damages sustained, awards for exemplary damages and attorney's fees were not proper.
