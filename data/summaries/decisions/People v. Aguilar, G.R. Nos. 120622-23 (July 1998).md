## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Aguilar*, G.R. Nos. 120622-23 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision finding the accused, Noel Aguilar, guilty of two counts of murder for the deaths of Helen Revilla and Angelaida Pascua.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Initial Charges:** Aguilar was initially charged with two counts of murder under the Revised Penal Code, with aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.
*   **Accused's Defense:** Aguilar claimed self-defense, alleging the victims attempted to rob him and he acted in fear for his life. He argued that he was drunk and did not intentionally inflict the injuries.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The trial court convicted Aguilar of two counts of murder, rejecting his self-defense claim and finding that treachery was present. He was sentenced to two terms of *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay damages.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court **modified** the RTC decision, finding Aguilar guilty of **two counts of Homicide** instead of murder.
    *   The Court rejected the claim of self-defense due to insufficient evidence of unlawful aggression and the unreasonableness of the force used. *See People v. Gelera, G.R. No. 121377, August 15, 1997; People v. Panes, G.R. No. 116744-47, August 29, 1997.*
    *   The Court overturned the finding of treachery due to lack of specific evidence as to the manner of the attack. Treachery must be proved as clearly as the crime itself. *See People v. Zamora, G.R. No. 101829, August 21, 1997.*
    *   Consequently, the court applied Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code, finding him guilty of homicide.
    *   The Supreme Court sustained the award of P50,000.00 as indemnity to the heirs of each victim but **deleted** the awards for moral and actual damages due to insufficient proof. *See People v. Obello, G.R. No. 108772, January 14, 1998.*
*   **Sentence:** Aguilar was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 8 months of *prision mayor* as minimum to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal* as maximum for each count of homicide.

**Obligations:**

*   Aguilar is obligated to serve the imposed prison sentence and pay P50,000 as indemnity to the heirs of each victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Aguilar bears criminal liability for the deaths of the victims under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code (Homicide).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Eyewitness Testimony:** The absence of eyewitnesses to the actual killings presented challenges in establishing the specific circumstances, particularly regarding treachery. The prosecution's case rested heavily on circumstantial evidence.
*   **Self-Defense Argument:** Though rejected, the self-defense argument hinged on the accused's testimony regarding the sequence of events, which was difficult to disprove definitively in the absence of conflicting direct evidence.
*   **Damages:** While the initial award of moral and actual damages was overturned, the possibility of pursuing civil actions for damages remains open to the heirs of the victims.
*   **Aggravating/Mitigating Circumstances:** The court found no aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Further investigation might reveal facts that could influence sentencing, if relevant to any future legal action.
