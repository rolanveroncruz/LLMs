## Legal Document Summary - People v. Mateo y Dizon, G.R. No. 170569

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Norberto Mateo y Dizon for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. 7659). The RTC found Mateo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping AAA. The CA affirmed, with a modification to include moral damages. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, committed through force and intimidation. Elements per Art. 335 RPC (as amended) established: carnal knowledge of a woman against her will.
*   **Victim (AAA):** 16 years old at the time of the incident. Testimony deemed credible by the RTC; mental capacity considered.
*   **Eyewitness (Zenaida Torno):** Testimony corroborated AAA's account, directly observing the act.
*   **Medical Evidence:** Dr. Reyes' report and testimony confirmed fresh hymenal laceration and other injuries consistent with the victim's account of forced sexual intercourse.
*   **Mental Capacity of Victim:** While evidence suggested mental retardation (IQ 38, mental age 5 years 8 months), the information not alleged in the complaint, thus force/intimidation must be proven.
*   **Force and Intimidation:** The Court found sufficient evidence of force (pulling victim to grassy area) and intimidation (threats of death), rendering resistance unnecessary and irrelevant.
* **Credibility of Testimony** Trial court's assessment of witness credibility is accorded great weight.
* **Reclusion Perpetua**: Due to the presence of force or intimidation and the absence of other attendant circumstances, the RTC correctly imposed the penalty of reclusion perpetua.

**Obligations:**

*   **Appellant (Norberto Mateo y Dizon):** Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:** Guilty of rape, leading to imprisonment.
*   **Civil:** Liable to pay P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mental Capacity Argument:** Although the court affirms conviction based on force and intimidation, the argument about victim's mental capacity is a potential point of contention.
*   **Ambiguity:** The specific acts constituting "force" and "intimidation" may be subject to different interpretations.
