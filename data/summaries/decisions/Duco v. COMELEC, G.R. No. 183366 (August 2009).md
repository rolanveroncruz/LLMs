Here's a legal summary of *Ricardo C. Duco v. Commission on Elections and Narciso B. Avelino*, G.R. No. 183366, August 19, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the COMELEC's dismissal of Petitioner Duco's appeal in an election protest case. The COMELEC dismissed Duco's appeal from the MCTC decision, which ruled against him, due to his failure to pay the correct appeal fee and his failure to perfect the appeal within the 5-day reglementary period, as prescribed by the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. Furthermore, his motion for reconsideration was denied due to his non-payment of the necessary motion fees and for failure to specify that the evidence is insufficient to justify the assailed Order or that the same is contrary to law.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Appeal Fees (COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 40, Sec. 3, amended by Resolution No. 02-0130):** Requires payment of a P3,000 appeal fee, P50 legal research fee, and P150 bailiff's fee for election cases appealed from courts of limited jurisdiction.
*   **Payment of Appeal Fees (COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 40, Sec. 4):** Payment "shall be paid to, and deposited with, the Cash Division of the Commission within the period to file the notice of appeal."
*   **Perfection of Appeal (COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 22, Sec. 3):** Notice of appeal must be filed within five days after promulgation of the decision.
*   **Grounds for Dismissal of Appeal (COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 22, Sec. 9(a)):** "Failure of the appellant to pay the correct appeal fee" is grounds for dismissal of the appeal.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Requires payment of motion fees under Sec. 7 (f), Rule 40 of the Comelec Rules of Procedure as amended by Comelec Resolution No. 02-0130 and for failure to specify that the evidence is insufficient to justify the assailed Order or that the same is contrary to law.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration (Article IX-C, Sec. 3 of the Constitution):** Motions for reconsideration must be decided by the COMELEC en banc.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Failure to Pay Correct Appeal Fee:** Leads to dismissal of the appeal and the MCTC decision becomes final and immutable.
*   **Late Payment of Appeal Fee:**  The date of payment is considered the actual date of filing the appeal, so payments made after the 5-day period will not cure the defect.
*   **Good Faith is Not a Defense:**  The SC has ruled out claims of good faith or excusable negligence for failure to pay full filing fees in election cases after the *Loyola v. COMELEC* decision.
*   **Failure to pay motion fees:** Results in denial of the Motion for Reconsideration.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***Zamoras v. Court of Appeals*, G. R. No. 158610, November 12, 2004, 442 SCRA 397:** Held that the subsequent payment of the filing fee after the lapse of the reglementary period does not cure the jurisdictional defect.
*   ***Aguilar v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 185140, June 30, 2009:**  Discusses the COMELEC's discretion in dismissing an appeal with incomplete appeal fees.
*   ***Divinagracia, Jr. v. COMELEC*, G. R. Nos. 186007 and 186016, July 27, 2009:** Reiterates the need to follow COMELEC Resolution No. 8486 on appeal fees and established that errors in the non-payment or incomplete payment of the two appeal fees in election cases are no longer excusable for notices of appeal filed after the promulgation of the decision.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Arguments:**

*   **Application of COMELEC Resolution No. 02-0130:** The petitioner argued that the COMELEC should not have strictly applied the resolution without showing that the MCTC was furnished a copy. The SC rejected this argument, stating that the MCTC was already aware of the resolution.

**Key Takeaway:**

This case highlights the strict adherence to procedural rules regarding appeal fees in election cases.  The SC emphasized that timely and correct payment of appeal fees is a jurisdictional requirement, and failure to comply will result in the dismissal of the appeal, regardless of claimed "good faith".
