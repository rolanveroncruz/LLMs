**Case Summary: _Lynn Maagad vs. Juanito Maagad_, G.R. No. 171762**

This case involves a dispute over Lot No. 6297, originally part of the estate of Proceso Maagad. The respondent, Juanito Maagad, sought annulment and/or reconveyance of title, alleging a mistake in the 1972 Extrajudicial Partition where the lot was erroneously adjudicated to Adelo Maagad (petitioner Lynn Maagad's father), instead of himself.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Erroneous Extrajudicial Partition:** Respondent argues the original partition contained a mistake, assigning Lot 6297 to Adelo when it should have gone to him based on prior possession and agreement.
*   **Memorandum of Exchange:** A 1990 Memorandum of Exchange attempted to rectify the error but contained a similar mistake. While technically ineffective, the CA and SC held it demonstrated recognition of the mistake by Adelo's heirs, including Lynn Maagad.
*   **Free Patent Application:** Lynn Maagad obtained Free Patent No. 104305-93-932 and OCT No. P-3614 in his name, representing Adelo's heirs. Respondent challenged this, leading to the lawsuit.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Section 9):** The RTC initially dismissed the case, citing the parol evidence rule, preventing alteration of a written agreement by oral testimony.
*   **Exception to Parol Evidence Rule:** The Supreme Court (SC) agreed with the Court of Appeals (CA) that the case falls under the **mistake exception** to the parol evidence rule. The SC found that the existence of mistake in the partition and exchange was evident and supported by the actions of the parties. The SC noted that all requirements were met for this exception based on the facts and circumstances of the case. 
*   **Fraudulent Free Patent:** The SC found Lynn Maagad's free patent application was fraudulent because he misrepresented his possession and occupancy of Lot 6297 and failed to acknowledge the possession of Juanito. The SC considered that Lynn's assertion of actual, continuous possession and the demand letter to Juanito contradict the facts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner Lynn Maagad** had the obligation to accurately represent the facts in his free patent application. He is liable for fraud due to misrepresentations regarding possession and occupancy. He also bears the liability of the improperly acquired title being voided.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Mistake:** The most contentious issue is the double mistake in the partition and the exchange agreement. However, this was used against the Petitioner because his recognition of the errors in the partition and exchange agreement through the memorandum.
*   **Reconveyance vs. Nullity:** The SC affirmed the CA's decision, but clarified that the title cannot be reconveyed, as it is *void ab initio*.
*   **Reliance on Admission:** The court heavily relies on Lynn Maagad's admission in his Petition for Review acknowledging the mutual mistake, which weakened his position.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 130, Section 9, Revised Rules on Evidence (Parol Evidence Rule)**
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act)**
*   **Republic Act No. 6940 (Amendment to Public Land Act)**
*   **Civil Code Art. 1361 & 1332 (Mistake in Instruments)**
*   *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Fidelity & Surety Co., 51 Phil. 57 (1927)*
*   *Leonardo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125485, 13 September 2004, 438 SCRA 201*
*   *Gasataya v. Mabasa, G. R. No. 148147, 16 February 2007, 516 SCRA 105*
*   *Heirs of Manuel A. Roxas v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 118436, 21 March 1997, 270 SCRA 309*

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirmed the CA decision, and declared OCT No. P-3614 issued to the Heirs of Adelo Maagad null and void. Juanito Maagad was declared the rightful owner and possessor of Lot No. 6297. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of accuracy in property transactions and the potential consequences of fraudulent land acquisitions.
