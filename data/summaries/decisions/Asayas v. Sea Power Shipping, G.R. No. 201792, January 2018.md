## Legal Document Summary: *Wilfredo P. Asayas v. Sea Power Shipping Enterprises, Inc., et al.* (G.R. No. 201792)

**Nature:** Appeal by seafarer (Petitioner) against a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the NLRC and Labor Arbiter (LA) decisions, which had declared his termination illegal and ordered payment of unexpired contract salaries.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Petitioner was employed as Third Officer (later Second Mate) on vessels owned/operated by Respondents. Contracts were terminated early due to vessel sales.
*   **POEA Standard Contract:** Specifically mentions Sections 23 and 26 regarding termination due to vessel sale, lay-up, or change of principal, entitling seafarer to earned wages, repatriation, and one month's basic wage as termination pay.
*   **Compromise Agreement with Quitclaim:** Petitioner previously entered into a compromise agreement with quitclaim for a prior complaint (recruitment violation/disciplinary action).
*   **Finality of LA Decision:** LA ruled termination illegal and ordered payment of unexpired salaries. Respondents' copy of the decision was returned as "Moved Out." LA issued a writ of execution. Respondents appealed belatedly to the NLRC.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents' Obligation:** Under the POEA Standard Contract, Respondents are obligated to pay earned wages, repatriation costs, and one month's basic wage upon termination due to vessel sale. The LA held they failed to prove a valid cause for termination beyond this.
*   **Petitioner's Alleged Obligation:** The CA ordered the Petitioner to return amounts received from garnished funds (P1,079,320.03) with 12% legal interest per annum from date of receipt because the CA reversed the NLRC and LA.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Quitclaim:** The CA erroneously relied on the quitclaim's supposed validity. A key issue is whether the quitclaim covered the illegal dismissal claim or only the recruitment violation/disciplinary action. The LA determined that the quitclaim did not preclude the action for illegal dismissal.
*   **Finality of LA Decision/Procedural Issues:** The CA erred in reviewing a final and immutable judgment. The core legal issue concerns the validity of the service of the LA decision by registered mail. Under *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Heirs of Bernardin J. Zamora*, service is deemed complete five days after the returned mail, triggering the appeal period. The Respondents failed to appeal within the prescribed timeframe.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The CA overstepped its authority. The Supreme Court determined that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Application of POEA Standard Contract:** The LA found that termination due to the sale of the vessel, although permitted under the POEA contract, was not implemented correctly. Respondents failed to show that they had transferred or re-engaged the Petitioner to another vessel as promised.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Heirs of Bernardin J. Zamora*:** Addresses the issue of constructive service by registered mail and the burden of proof associated with it.
*   ***De los Santos v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company*:** Defines "grave abuse of discretion."

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Addresses the appeal periods to the NLRC.
*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):** Protects the rights of migrant workers and allows the seafarer to proceed his cause of action for illegal dismissal and money claims despite the existence of the Compromise Agreement with quitclaim.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision. The LA's decision was deemed final and executory due to the respondents' failure to timely appeal, making the termination illegal. The Supreme Court ordered the respondents to pay the costs of suit and reinstated the LA and NLRC rulings.
