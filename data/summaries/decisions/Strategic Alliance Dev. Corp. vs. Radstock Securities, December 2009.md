Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** Strategic Alliance Development Corporation vs. Radstock Securities Limited and Philippine National Construction Corporation, consolidated with Luis Sison vs. Philippine National Construction Corporation and Radstock Securities Limited (G.R. Nos. 178158 and 180428, December 4, 2009). Asiavest Merchant Bankers Berhad is an Intervenor.

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review challenging the validity of a Compromise Agreement between Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) and Radstock Securities Limited (Radstock).

**Key Provisions of the Compromise Agreement:**

*   **Settlement Amount:** PNCC to pay Radstock P6.185 billion in full settlement of a purported P17.04 billion debt (guarantee of CDCP Mining's loan from Marubeni Corporation, later assigned to Radstock).
*   **Payment Method:**
    *   Assignment of PNCC's rights to specified real properties to a third party assignee designated by Radstock (19 parcels). Valued at 70% of appraised value.
    *   Issuance of common shares to Radstock or its assignee representing 20% of PNCC's outstanding capital stock after conversion of Privatization Management Office (PMO) and National Development Company (NDC) debts to equity, subject to approval of SEC and ratification of stockholders, if necessary. (Assigned value of P713 Million based on market value)
    *   Assignment of 50% of PNCC's 6% share in the gross toll revenue of Manila North Tollways Corporation (MNTC) commencing in 2008, with a Net Present Value of P1.287 billion.

**Key Obligations:**

*   PNCC: To transfer properties, issue shares, and assign toll revenue as specified in the Compromise Agreement.
*   Radstock: To accept the assigned assets and revenue share as full settlement of the debt.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **PNCC Board's Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** The court finds the PNCC Board acted in bad faith and with gross negligence, breaching its duty of diligence and loyalty. This includes admitting liability for the Marubeni loans despite prior consistent denials, PNCC's insolvency, and questionable legal basis (reliance on Feria Law Office opinion without review by Board). Potential liability under Section 31 of the Corporation Code for damages. Violations of RA 3019.
*   **Unlawful and Criminal Acts:** The approval of Board Resolution Nos. BD-092-2000 and BD-099-2000 may constitute corrupt practice and unlawful act under Section 3(e) of RA 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, as "corrupt practices xxx and xxx unlawful.‚Äù Being unlawful and criminal acts, these PNCC Board Resolutions are void ab initio and cannot be implemented or in any way given effect by the Executive or Judicial branch of the Government.
*   **Violation of Constitution and Laws:**
    *   *Lack of Congressional Approval:* The Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292) requires Congressional approval for compromising claims exceeding P100,000 involving government agencies. PNCC is a government agency. The compromise lacks this approval.
    *   *Unconstitutional Disposal of Public Funds:* PNCC's toll fees are considered public funds. Disbursing these to Radstock without a Congressional appropriation violates Section 29(1), Article VI of the Constitution, PD 1445.
    *   *Violation of Public Purpose Doctrine:* Using public funds to pay CDCP Mining's private debt to Radstock violates the requirement that government funds be used only for public purposes.
    *   *Foreign Land Ownership Restriction:* Radstock, a foreign corporation, is disqualified from owning land in the Philippines. Assigning the *right to designate* a transferee for the properties is an illegal circumvention of this restriction.
    *   *Violation of Rules on Preference of Credit:* Prioritizing Radstock over other creditors, including the National Government (owed P36 billion), violates Civil Code provisions on concurrence and preference of credits. Potential fraud against creditors under Article 1387 of the Civil Code.
*   **Invalidity of Tollway Operation Certificate (TOC):** The court questions the Toll Regulatory Board's (TRB) authority to grant PNCC a TOC after the expiration of PNCC's franchise, suggesting PNCC lacked the right to collect toll fees.
*   **Disposition of GOCC Assets Without Public Bidding:** The dacion en pago arrangement circumvents the requirement of public bidding for the disposition of government assets.
*   **Malversation:* PNCC's use of Toll Revenue to pay a private debt may constitute malversation of public funds.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Constitution of the Philippines:** Article VI, Section 29(1) (appropriations); Article XII, Sections 3 and 7 (land ownership restrictions).
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1139, 1155, 1387, 1409, 1459, 2241, 2242, 2243, 2244 (contracts, preference of credits).
*   **Corporation Code:** Sections 25, 31 (directors' duties and liabilities).
*   **Government Auditing Code (PD 1445):** Sections 4, 79, 84, 85, 86, 87 (financial transactions and auditing).
*   **Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (RA 3019):** Section 3(e) (corrupt practices).
*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292):** Section 20, Chapter IV, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V (power to compromise claims).
*   **Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Dy, G.R. No. 156887:**  Previous case established some principles of law applicable to this case.
*   **Feliciano v. Commission on Audit, 464 Phil. 441 (2004):** Extended description of COA's juridiction over government owned and controlled corporations.
*   **Benedicto v. Board of Administrators of Television Stations, et al., G.R. No. 87710, March 31, 1992.** Addressed when Congressional approval is required in claims against the government.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The provisions outlining the method of payment in the Compromise Agreement, specifically the valuation and transfer of properties and the assignment of toll revenue rights. The method of payment in essence violated the public policy that government funds be spent solely for public purposes.
*   The legality of assigning the right to designate the qualified assignee to the subject properties.
*   The status of PNCC's liabilities after expiration of the franchise; the status of the toll revenues to Radstock.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   PNCC and Radstock will likely argue that the compromise was entered into good faith to minimize PNCC's potential liability, to avoid litigation and that it was a sound business judgment under the circumstances.
*   Radstock might argue a "settled amount" has been reached with PNCC which is a claim against the government, therefore Radstock could receive payment.
*   Radstock might invoke the principle of pari passu.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court *GRANTS* the petition of Luis Sison (G.R. No. 180428). The Court *SETS ASIDE* the Court of Appeals decision dated January 25, 2007, and its Resolutions of June 12, 2007 and November 5, 2007. The Court *DECLARES* Board Resolution Nos. BD-092-2000 and BD-099-2000 to be *VOID AB INITIO* and further *DECLARES* the Compromise Agreement to be *INEXISTENT AND VOID AB INITIO.* Asiavest Merchant Bankers Berhad is granted intervention and Strategic Alliance Development Corporation has no legal standing to sue.

The court's strong language indicates a high likelihood of success in challenging the Compromise Agreement based on the grounds stated above. Due to the potential criminal and ethics issues, the actions and deliberations of the PNCC Board, its legal counsel, and others involved warrant closer scrutiny.
