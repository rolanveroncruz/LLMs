## Legal Document Summary: *Gutang v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 124760, July 08, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a petition for certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of a judge's voluntary inhibition and the subsequent actions stemming therefrom.

**Facts:**

*   Private respondents (Looyuko and Uy) obtained an order for a final deed of sale, cancellation of TCT 242 (Gutang spouses), and issuance of a writ of possession in Civil Case No. R-82-5792.
*   Petitioner Antonia J. Gutang questioned the order, which was dismissed. A writ of possession was issued.
*   Private respondents then filed a motion to inhibit Judge de la Cruz, Jr. due to perceived inaction on their motion for alias writ of possession.
*   Judge de la Cruz, Jr. denied the motion for inhibition but *voluntarily* inhibited himself.
*   Case re-raffled to Judge Makasiar who granted the alias writ of possession.
*   Petitioners filed a petition before the CA arguing that Judge de la Cruz Jr erred when he inhibited himself, even when he found no legal or factual basis for such inhibition.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding Judge de la Cruz, Jr.'s voluntary inhibition.
*   **Rationale:** While the judge found no *legal* basis for *compulsory* inhibition under Rule 137, Sec. 1, a judge may *voluntarily* inhibit for "just and valid reasons" based on sound discretion and conscience.
*   The court cited *Pimentel v. Salanga* and highlighted the need for judges to maintain public trust and confidence. The judge's concern about potential distrust in future rulings, even if unfounded, constituted a valid reason for inhibition. This is based on the judge's subjective assessment of the circumstances, and the court will not disturb it in the absence of arbitrariness.
*   Mandamus to compel Judge de la Cruz, Jr. was inappropriate because inhibition is discretionary.
*   Prohibition against Judge Makasiar was unwarranted as the re-raffle followed Supreme Court Circular No. 7, Series of 1974.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 137, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Governs disqualification and inhibition of judges.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 7, s. 1974:** Governs the re-assignment of cases of disqualified judges.
*   **Judge's Obligation:** Maintain public trust and confidence in the judiciary; exercise discretion judiciously; consider potential bias or prejudice, even if arising from unfounded perceptions.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly stated. However, implicit is the potential liability for *grave abuse of discretion* if the court is found to have acted arbitrarily and whimsically.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion:** A judge using voluntary inhibition as a tactic to avoid difficult cases or appease litigants, undermining judicial efficiency.
*   **Misinterpretation of *Pimentel v. Salanga*:** The case should not be used as a blanket justification for any inhibition, but requires a genuine concern about potential bias based on objective circumstances.
*   **Delay:** Inhibition and re-raffle can lead to delays in adjudication.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 137, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Disqualification of Judges.
*   **Pimentel v. Salanga, 21 SCRA 160:** Guides judges in considering potential bias and maintaining impartiality.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 7, s. 1974:** Re-assignment of Cases of Disqualified Judges.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "just and valid reasons" in Rule 137, Sec. 1, 2nd paragraph, lacks concrete definition, leading to subjective interpretations.
*   The extent to which a judge must "conduct a careful self-examination" regarding potential bias is not clearly defined.

**Note:** This document focuses on the *voluntary* inhibition by a judge. It doesn't delve into specific issues of the underlying case.
