## Legal Document Summary: *Dasmari単as Village Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127276, December 3, 1998*

**Nature:**  Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision dismissing a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus. The CA upheld the RTC's denial of a Motion to Dismiss a complaint for Injunction and Damages filed by Colegio San Agustin (CSA) against Dasmari単as Village Association, Inc. (DVA) and several of its officers.

**Key Issue:** Whether Civil Case No. 95-1396 (Injunction and Damages) is barred by *litis pendentia* due to Civil Case No. 94-2062 (Declaratory Relief and Damages).  Subsidiary issue of whether CSA is guilty of forum shopping.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals decision. The SC found that *litis pendentia* did not exist because while there was partial identity of parties, there was no identity of rights asserted, reliefs prayed for, or causes of action between the two cases. Consequently, there was no forum shopping. The SC emphasized the denial of a Motion to Dismiss is an interlocutory order not subject to certiorari, absent grave abuse of discretion.

**Facts:**

*   **1969 Onward:** CSA operates a school within Dasmari単as Village, initially exempt from village dues. Later agreements establish "membership dues" arrangement.
*   **1988 Agreement:** CSA proposes, and DVA accepts, a permanent "membership dues" rate of 50% of regular resident dues. Complied with until 1992.
*   **1992 Assessment:** DVA assesses CSA full dues (P550,000), denying the 50% discount. CSA protests.
*   **DVA Actions:** Restricts CSA vehicle access and implements a security measure barring entry after 6:00 PM.
*   **Civil Case No. 94-2062 (Declaratory Relief):** CSA files suit to determine proper membership dues and enjoin unreasonable security policy. RTC dismisses; appealed to CA.
*   **September 9, 1995 Incident:**  DVA denies entry to vehicles without DVA stickers attending review classes on CSA premises.
*   **Civil Case No. 95-1396 (Injunction and Damages):** CSA files new suit for injunction and damages relating to the September 9, 1995 incident. DVA moves to dismiss based on *litis pendentia* and forum shopping. RTC denies motion; appealed to CA, which affirms denial.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **DVA Obligation:** DVA has an obligation to honor the agreement regarding the 50% membership dues discount.
*   **DVA Restraint:** DVA must refrain from imposing arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on access to CSA premises.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **DVA Liability:** DVA could be held liable for damages resulting from its actions in denying entry to vehicles and unilaterally increasing dues.
*   **Forum Shopping Risk:** DVA argued CSA was engaged in forum shopping, which would have resulted in dismissal of the subsequent case. This argument failed due to lack of identity of cause of action.
*   **Risk of future litigation:** The ruling suggests that DVA's actions could lead to future litigation if the relationship between the association and the school continues to deteriorate.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 16, Sec. 1(e), 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Basis for dismissal based on *litis pendentia.*
*   **Rule 2, Sec. 4, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Effect of splitting a single cause of action.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 279 SCRA 506 (1997):** Priority and time rule.
*   **Investors Finance Corp. v. Ebarce, 163 SCRA 60 (1988):** Declaration of public policy against multiplicity of suits.
*   **Casil v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 121534, January 28, 1998 (and other cases cited in the decision):**  Established the three requisites for *litis pendentia.*
*   **International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 249 SCRA 389 (1995):** Defines forum shopping.
*   **Espa単o Sr. v. Court of Appeals, 268 SCRA 511 (1997):** Non-appealability of interlocutory orders, absent grave abuse of discretion.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial agreements (1969 onwards) and the specific language establishing "membership dues" are crucial. The legal effect of calling them "membership dues" versus "village dues" is a possible area of contention.
*   The interpretation of what constitutes "unreasonable security policy" is subject to debate.  The specifics of security needs and the reasonableness of restrictions would likely be a focal point in any further litigation.

**Legal Analysis & Potential Strategy Points for Colegio San Agustin:**

*   **Enforceability of the 1988 Agreement:** CSA's strongest argument lies in the enforceability of the 1988 agreement regarding the 50% discount. Focus on establishing a clear contract (offer, acceptance, consideration) and DVA's breach.
*   **Damages Calculation:** Meticulously document all damages stemming from DVA's actions (e.g., lost review class revenue, reputational harm).
*   **Injunctive Relief:** Persistently seek injunctive relief to prevent DVA from future arbitrary actions that disrupt CSA's operations.
*   **Duty to Negotiate in Good Faith:** Argue that DVA has a duty to negotiate in good faith any changes to the membership dues structure or security policies, given the long-standing relationship.
*   **Dismisal is interlocutory**  If the first case were to be dismissed, make sure it is 'without prejudice' to re-filing, to avoid any issues of res judicata.
