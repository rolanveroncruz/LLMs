**Case Summary: People v. Juego, G.R. No. 123162, October 13, 1998 (358 Phil. 499)**

**Nature:** Appeal of conviction for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and two counts of Estafa.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Art. 38(a) Labor Code):** Accused Nenita Juego convicted for recruiting 26 individuals (6 pursued the case) for overseas employment without a license from the POEA.  This constitutes illegal recruitment in large scale as defined by Art. 38(b) of the Labor Code, punishable under Art. 39(a).
*   **Estafa (Art. 315(2)(a) RPC):** Juego also convicted on two counts of Estafa for defrauding Anastacio Magleo (P21,315.00) and Raul Romero (P30,115.00) by falsely representing her ability to secure overseas employment for them and inducing them to pay processing fees.
*   **Defense:**  Juego claimed she was merely a housewife and that the recruitment activities were solely conducted by her deceased husband, Abelardo Juego. This was rejected by the Court.  The court emphasized that the testimony of complainants identifying Juego as the recruiter sufficiently proves her involvement.
*   **Receipts:**  The presence or absence of signed receipts is not necessarily fatal to the case, provided witnesses positively identify the accused as the one involved in the prohibited recruitment.
*   **Penalties:** The Supreme Court affirmed with modifications, sentencing Juego to life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.00 for illegal recruitment and indeterminate prison terms for each count of Estafa, following Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Crim. Case No. 93-128141 (Estafa): four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional medium as minimum to six (6) years and four (4) months of prision mayor minimum as maximum.
*   Crim. Case No. 93-128143 (Estafa): four (4) years two (2) months and one (1) day of prision correccional maximum as minimum to six (6) years eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor minimum as maximum.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Restitution:**  Juego is ordered to indemnify the complaining witnesses for the amounts they paid as processing fees as listed.
*   **Criminal Liability:** Subject to serving life imprisonment and fine for illegal recruitment and indeterminate prison terms for each count of Estafa.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Co-Accused at Large:** Wilfredo Gaerlan remains at large.
*   **Art. 70 RPC application**  Application of Article 70 of the Revised Penal Code regarding successive service of sentences.
*   **Proof of Guilt:** The appellant's defense rests largely on denial of guilt, highlighting the importance of strong eyewitness testimonies in establishing culpability.
