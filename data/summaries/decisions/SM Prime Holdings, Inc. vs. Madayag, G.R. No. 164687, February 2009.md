**Case:** *SM Prime Holdings, Inc. vs. Angela V. Madayag*, G.R. No. 164687, February 12, 2009 (598 Phil. 371)

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order suspending land registration proceedings initiated by Respondent Madayag. Petitioner SM Prime Holdings (SMPHI) opposed Madayag's application, arguing that her survey plan encroached on SMPHI's titled properties. SMPHI also filed a petition with the DENR for cancellation of Madayag's survey plan. The RTC suspended the land registration case pending the DENR's resolution of the cancellation petition. The CA reversed, finding grave abuse of discretion. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Application for Land Registration:** Madayag filed for registration of a parcel of land based on a survey plan approved by the Land Management Services (LMS) of DENR.
*   **Opposition:** SMPHI opposed the registration, claiming encroachment on its existing titled properties.
*   **Petition for Cancellation of Survey Plan:** SMPHI filed a petition with the DENR for cancellation of Madayag's survey plan, alleging lack of notice and bad faith.
*   **RTC Order of Suspension:** The RTC suspended the land registration proceedings pending DENR's resolution of the cancellation petition.
*   **CA Reversal:** The CA reversed the RTC, ordering it to continue the land registration proceedings.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Madayag:** Obligated to prove entitlement to land registration, which includes valid survey plan.
*   **SMPHI:** Bears the burden of proving its opposition to the registration, particularly that Madayag's application encroaches upon SMPHI's existing valid titles.
*   **RTC:** Obligation to resolve the land registration case expeditiously, hearing all relevant evidence and determining the validity of the application, including potential overlaps with existing titles.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Overlap of Properties:** The central issue is the potential overlap between Madayag's claimed land and SMPHI's titled properties.  This requires careful examination of survey plans and titles.
*   **Authority to Determine Validity:** The case highlights the jurisdictional interplay between the DENR (regarding survey plan validity) and the RTC (as a land registration court). The Supreme Court clarifies that the RTC has the power to resolve the issue of overlap without necessarily declaring the survey plan void.
*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** Applying for registration on already titled land may be considered collateral attack.
*   **Delay:** Suspending the proceedings pending a DENR decision could cause undue delay.
*   **Section 4(15), Chapter 1, Title XIV, Administrative Code of 1987** Petitioner posits that the DENR has sole jurisdiction regarding the validity of the survey plan.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529** Elimination of the distinction between RTC's general jurisdiction and its limited jurisdiction when acting merely as a land registration court.
*   **Section 21 of P.D. No. 1529** the land registration court may require the filing of additional papers to aid in its determination of the propriety of the application.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Land Registration Law):** Governs land registration proceedings.

**Analysis for SMPHI:**

SMPHI's primary risk is the loss of a portion of its titled property if Madayag's land registration is ultimately successful. SMPHI should focus on presenting clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that Madayag's survey plan encroaches upon SMPHI's existing titles.  SMPHI should argue that based on **Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529** the application for land registration of Madayag, constitutes collateral attack on the existing title. While the RTC can resolve the overlap issue, SMPHI should continue to pursue the DENR petition for cancellation of the survey plan as a complementary strategy.

**Analysis for Madayag:**

Madayag needs to establish the validity of her claim and the accuracy of her survey plan. A key point is demonstrating that her application does not constitute a collateral attack on an existing title. She can argue the existing titles is void and that the land is alienable and disposable in accordance with the Land Registration Law.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court decision clarifies that the land registration court has broad authority to resolve all issues related to a land registration application, including potential overlaps with existing titles. The RTC is directed to continue with the proceedings and resolve the case expeditiously. The burden is on SMPHI to prove its opposition, and on Madayag to demonstrate entitlement to registration.
