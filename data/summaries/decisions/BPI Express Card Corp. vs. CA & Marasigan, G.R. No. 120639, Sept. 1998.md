## Legal Document Summary: BPI Express Card Corp. v. Court of Appeals and Marasigan (G.R. No. 120639, Sept. 25, 1998)

**Subject:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision awarding damages to a credit card holder (Marasigan) for the dishonor of his credit card by BPI Express Card Corporation (BPIECC).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Credit Card Agreement:** Marasigan was a BPIECC cardholder. The agreement stipulated that any card with outstanding balances unpaid after 30 days from the original billing date would automatically be suspended, and after 60 days, cancelled.
*   **Default:** Marasigan failed to pay his billings within 30 days of the original billing date, placing him in default.
*   **Postdated Check:** Marasigan issued a postdated check for P15,000 to cover his outstanding balance, allegedly with an assurance from BPIECC personnel that his card would not be suspended.
*   **Suspension and Dishonor:** BPIECC suspended Marasigan's card. When he presented it at Cafe Adriatico, it was dishonored, causing him embarrassment.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** Both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals initially ruled in favor of Marasigan, awarding him moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.

**Obligations:**

*   **Marasigan:** Obligated to pay credit card charges on time as per the cardholder agreement.
*   **BPIECC:** Obligated to honor credit card transactions within the cardholder's credit limit, but with the right to suspend/cancel cards based on non-payment as outlined in the agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   The key issue is whether BPIECC is liable for damages stemming from the card's dishonor. The lower courts found liability based on Article 19 of the Civil Code (abuse of right).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The agreement regarding the postdated check:** The central dispute revolves around whether BPIECC made an implicit agreement to keep the card active in exchange for the postdated check.
*   **Notice of Suspension:** The contract dictates automatic suspension but there arises whether there's sufficient notification and the timeline of that notification.
*   **Interpretation of Contractual Terms:** The automatic suspension clause is strictly construed.
*   **Damages vs. Injury (Damnum Absque Injuria):** Even if damages are proved to have been incurred, the central point remains whether legal injury was done to the plaintiff.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 19:**  Basis for the initial rulings finding abuse of right.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 131 Sec. 3(m):** Discusses the presumption of delivery via mail for the letter notifying the cancellation of the credit card.
*   **Roman Catholic Bishop of Malolos, Inc. vs. IAC, 191 SCRA 411 (1990):** Relates to the fact that a check is a substitution of money and is not payment by itself.
*   **Albenson Enterprises Corp. vs. CA, 217 SCRA 16, 25 (1993):** Discusses the elements of an abuse of rights claim.
*   **Custodio vs. CA, 253 SCRA 483 (1996):** Distinguishes between damage and injury (damnum absque injuria).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Agreement with the employee of the defendant:** It is ambiguous whether or not an employee of the defendant can enter into a valid contract without the employer.
*   **Nature of the "arrangement" regarding the check:** Whether it constituted a binding agreement altering the terms of the original credit card contract and what the terms of the arrangement are.
*   **Adequacy of Notice of Suspension:** Although provided for automatically, whether the letter constituted appropriate and timely notice, considering the potential for embarrassment.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the Court of Appeals decision. It held that:

*   BPIECC had the contractual right to suspend the card based on non-payment.
*   The issuance of the postdated check was not effective payment.
*   BPIECC did not act in bad faith and did not abuse its rights.
*   Marasigan's embarrassment was a consequence of his own failure to meet his obligations (damnum absque injuria).
*   Marasigan was ordered to pay his outstanding obligation to BPIECC.
