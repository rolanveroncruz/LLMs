## Legal Document Summary: *Mitra v. Sablan-Guevarra*, G.R. No. 213994 (2018)

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's decision to disallow the probate of Remedios Legaspi y Reyes's (Legaspi) will. The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA, reinstating the RTC's decision to admit the will to probate.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Probate Petition:** Margie Santos Mitra (Petitioner), claiming to be Legaspi's de facto adopted daughter, filed a petition for probate of Legaspi's notarial will.
*   **Opposition:** Perpetua L. Sablan-Guevarra and Remigio L. Sablan (Respondents), claiming to be legal heirs, opposed, alleging improper execution, lack of signatures, defective attestation clause, and undue influence.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC admitted the will to probate, finding proper execution and testamentary capacity. It considered the final page a continuation of the Acknowledgment, not requiring signatures, and the page count sufficient due to its inclusion in the Acknowledgment.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA *reversed*, finding fatal defects: (1) lack of instrumental witnesses' signatures on each page, and (2) failure to state the number of pages in the attestation clause, relying on pre-Civil Code jurisprudence (e.g., *Uy Coque v. Naves Sioca*; *In re: Will of Andrada*).
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC reversed the CA, holding that the will substantially complied with Article 805 and 809 of the Civil Code.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Testator & Witnesses' Signature:** The CA erred in holding that the instrumental witnesses did not sign each page. The SC found the original will bore signatures on each page except the last, which was an extension of acknowledgement.
*   **Attestation Clause:** While the attestation clause lacked the number of pages, this information was present in the Acknowledgment.
*   **Substantial Compliance:**  The SC applied the doctrine of substantial compliance (Art. 809, Civil Code), citing *Singson v. Florentino*, *Taboada v. Hon. Rosal*, and *Azuela v. CA*. Omissions curable through examination of the will itself (without extrinsic evidence) do not invalidate the will.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Photocopy Evidence:** The CA's reliance on a potentially altered photocopy, where signatures appeared absent, created a factual dispute. This highlights the importance of submitting original documents or properly authenticated copies.  The Respondent's reliance on the CA's review of the photocopied document.
*   **Application of Art. 809:** The case confirms that the liberal interpretation of Art. 809 applies even when the page count is omitted from the attestation clause, *provided* it appears elsewhere in the will (acknowledgement).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Articles 805 & 809:** Key provisions governing the formal requirements of wills and the doctrine of substantial compliance.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Addresses the limited scope of certiorari petitions to questions of law, relaxed here due to conflicting factual findings.
*   ***Uy Coque v. Naves Sioca* (43 Phil. 405 (1922)) & *In re: Will of Andrada* (42 Phil. 180, 181 (1921)):**  Cited by the CA, these pre-Civil Code cases emphasized strict compliance with attestation requirements.
*   ***Singson v. Florentino* (92 Phil. 161 (1952)):** Established a more liberal approach to probate, emphasizing substance over technicality.
*   ***Taboada v. Hon. Rosal* (203 Phil. 572 (1982)) & *Azuela v. CA* (521 Phil. 263, 280-281 (2006)):** Exemplify the application of substantial compliance when the number of pages is stated in the Acknowledgment, not the attestation clause.

**Overall:**

The case reinforces the principle that probate should be allowed where substantial compliance with formal requirements is evident and no bad faith, forgery, fraud, or undue influence is present. It clarifies that an attestation clause omitting the number of pages is not necessarily fatal if that information can be gleaned from other parts of the will, particularly the acknowledgment.
