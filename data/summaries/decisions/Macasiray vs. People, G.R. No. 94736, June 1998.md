## Legal Document Summary: *Macasiray v. People*, G.R. No. 94736 (June 26, 1998)

**Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision reverses the Court of Appeals' ruling and reinstates the Regional Trial Court's orders which had excluded an extrajudicial confession (Exhibit B) and preliminary investigation transcript (Exhibit D) as evidence against the petitioners (accused). The core issue is the admissibility of these documents, obtained without proper counsel during custodial investigation, and whether the defense waived their right to object to their admission.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Inadmissibility of Extrajudicial Confession:** The SC affirmed that the extrajudicial confession and the transcript of the preliminary investigation are inadmissible due to the lack of effective assistance of counsel during the custodial investigation, violating Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution. The Court found that the accused was informed of his rights in a perfunctory manner.
*   **Timing of Objections to Evidence:** The SC reiterates the established rule that objections to documentary evidence must be made at the time the evidence is formally offered, not merely when it is marked for identification.
*   **Impeachment:** The Court rules that because the documents were deemed inadmissible, there was no legal standing to impeach Benedicto Gonzales' credibility using the evidence.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal of Conviction (potential):** If the inadmissible evidence was a key element in the initial (unspecified) conviction, this ruling could lead to a reversal or retrial based on legally admissible evidence.
*   **Fruit of the Poisonous Tree:** Any evidence derived from the inadmissible confession could potentially be challenged under the "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine, further weakening the prosecution's case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution:** Guarantees the right to counsel during custodial investigation. (Now Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution)
*   **Rule 132, Sections 34, 35 & 36, Rules of Court:** Govern the procedure for offering and objecting to evidence.
*   **_People v. Caguioa_, 95 SCRA 2 (1980); _People v. Galit_, 135 SCRA 465 (1985); _Interpacific Transit, Inc. v. Aviles_, 186 SCRA 385 (1990):** Cited as precedents regarding the inadequacy of warnings given to the accused, the right to counsel, and the proper timing for objecting to evidence. _Caguioa_ addresses raising objections to the admissibility of a confession before it is formally offered in evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Waiver:** The Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that the defense waived their objection by (1) failing to object when the documents were marked for identification and (2) questioning the accused about the confession during his testimony. The SC clarifies that questioning for the purpose of *denying* the confession is not equivalent to adopting it as evidence.
*   **Prosecution Rebuttal:** The defense successfully argued that the prosecution could not present the inadmissible evidence as rebuttal because the information should not have been used in the first place due to the lack of legal standing.
