**Case Summary: People v. Villamor, G.R. No. 124441 (October 7, 1998)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction of ten counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Conviction Upheld:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Carlos Villamor for ten counts of rape against his niece, Efegin Villamor.
*   **Statutory Rape:** Though the information was defective for failing to state the complainant's age (a crucial element for statutory rape), the Court ruled the defect was cured by evidence presented at trial (the victim testified she was nine years old at the time of the first offense) and the defense's failure to object. Cited *Herrera, Remedial Law, Vol. IV, 1995, p. 420* and *People v. Rosare, 264 SCRA 398 (1996)*.
*   **Credibility of Victim:** The Court emphasized that the victim's testimony, if credible, is sufficient to convict. *People v. Antido, 278 SCRA 425 (1997)*. Delay in reporting due to the victim's age, fear of the accused (her uncle), and threats, was deemed excusable. *People v. Dones, 254 SCRA 696 (1996)*.
*   **Accused's Defense:** The accused's defense of denial and fabrication was deemed weak, and the Court noted the improbability of a fabricated rape charge. *People v. Danao, 253 SCRA 146 (1996)*.
*   **Duplicity of Information:** The fact that ten counts of rape were charged under one information, while technically a violation of Section 13, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, was deemed waived because the accused failed to move to quash the information before entering his plea. *People v. Ducay, 225 SCRA 1 (1993)*.
*   **Penalty:** The Court upheld the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape. Although RA 7659, which imposed the death penalty for rape by a relative within the third civil degree, was already enacted, it could not be applied retroactively, as the offense was committed before its effectivity.
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity of P50,000.00 for each count was upheld, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence at the time. The Court also awarded moral damages of P100,000.00, acknowledging the trauma suffered by the victim, even without specific pleading. *People v. Prades, G.R. No. 127569, July 30, 1998.*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Defective Information:** The initial defect in the information could have been a ground for reversal. The Court's reliance on the victim's testimony at trial to cure this defect highlights the importance of precise pleading.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The prospective application of RA 7659 is critical. This case underscores the significance of the date of the offense in determining the applicable penalty.
*   **Moral Damages (Rationale):** The Court's justification for awarding moral damages, stating they are now awarded without specific pleading in rape cases, could be subject to interpretation. The rationale hinges on the inherent trauma, but this may not apply to all cases.
