## Legal Document Summary: *Nilda Laguna Salazar vs. Commission on Audit (COA)* G.R. No. 255074

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of the Rules of Court, assailing COA Decision No. 2018-212 and Resolution in Decision No. 2020-386.

**Subject Matter:** Disallowance of PHP 23,048,230.15 related to the construction of the Mayantoc Memorial Park, due to non-compliance with RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9184, Sec. 12:** Outlines the functions of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC), including advertising/posting the invitation to bid and ensuring compliance with procurement standards.
*   **RA 9184, Sec. 21 & RIRR 21.2:** Specifies the advertising procedure for Invitations to Bid, requiring advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation, posting on PhilGEPS website, and posting in the procuring entity's premises.
*   **COA Circular No. 2009-002:** Requires the submission of final payment of contracts for pre-audit.
*   **COA Circular No. 2009-006 (Rules and Regulations on the Settlement of Accounts):** Defines Liability (4.17) and Persons Liable (4.20) and Guidelines in the issuance of Notice of Disallowance

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court found Salazar (BAC Member), along with the other members of the BAC, are jointly and severally liable for the disallowed amount due to non-compliance with RA 9184 and RIRR.
* Specifically, the court finds they failed to ensure that the procuring entity abides by the law

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process Concerns:** Salazar argued she was denied due process because the Notice of Suspension didn't adequately explain the reason for the violation.
    * Court rejected this argument, noting she actively participated in the process and any defects were effectively waived.
*   **Liability for BAC Secretariat's Actions:** Salazar argued the failure to post the Invitation to Bid on PhilGEPS was the responsibility of the BAC Secretariat, not the BAC itself.
    *   Court Rejected this argument holding that the BAC's oversight function extends to ensuring the Secretariat's compliance. The act of BAC secretariat is the act of the BAC, rendering it accountable for the failures.
*   **Disallowance of Total Project Cost vs. Unjust Enrichment:**
    *   Salazar argued that the disallowance of the total project cost was improper, as the project was completed and being used by the public.
    *   The Court acknowledges this argument and remands the case to the COA to determine the amount the contractor may retain under the principle of *quantum meruit*, commensurate with the actual use and enjoyment derived by the municipality.
*   **Solidary Liability:**
    *   Under Madera vs COA, those found liable are solidarily responsible for the *net disallowed amount* (total disallowed amount less amounts excused under the guidelines).
    * However, the payee/contractor (JQG Construction), initially named in the Notice of Suspension, was dropped from the Notice of Disallowance. Because of this, the payee/contractor cannot be held liable

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Madera v. COA (882 Phil. 744 (2020)):** Establishes rules on the return of disallowed amounts, distinguishing between approving/certifying officers acting in good faith and those acting in bad faith, malice, or gross negligence.
*   **Juan v. Commission on Audit (G.R. Nos. 237835):** Explained the concept of the Net Disallowed Amount and the corresponding liability for the approving and certifying officers under the 1987 Administrative Code.
*   **Torreta v. Commission on Audit (889 Phil. 1119 (2020)):** Allows for the reduction of disallowed amounts in unlawful/irregular government contracts based on *quantum meruit*.
* **Arias v. Sandiganbayan, (259 Phil. 794 (1989)** invoked by Razalan but ultimately unsuccessful as the court found he ignored the fact that there was no electronic posting of bid.
*   **Saligumba v. Commission on Audit** Court held that the due process is complied with if the party properly notified of allegations has been given an opportunity to defend themselves against those allegations.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Primary law governing government procurement.
*   **Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR) of RA 9184:** Provides detailed procedures for procurement processes.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 38 & 43:** Defines liability of public officials for unlawful expenditures.

**COA Ruling:**

The COA found Salazar liable for the disallowed amount due to her role as a BAC member and the BAC's failure to ensure compliance with procurement rules, particularly the posting of the Invitation to Bid on the PhilGEPS website.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Court affirmed the COA's finding of liability but remanded the case to the COA to determine the net disallowed amount after considering the reasonable value of services rendered by the payee/contractor (JQG Construction) based on the principle of *quantum meruit*. The payee itself, however, cannot be held liable as they were dropped from the Notice of Disallowance. Salazar, along with other persons named in the Notice of Disallowance, are solidarily liable for this adjusted amount.

**Next Steps:**

*   COA to determine the reasonable value of services rendered by JQG Construction and recalculate the net disallowed amount.
*   Consider potential administrative action against Razalan and the BAC members for violating procurement law.
