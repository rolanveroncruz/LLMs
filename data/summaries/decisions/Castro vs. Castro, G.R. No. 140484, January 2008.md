## Legal Document Summary: Castro v. Castro, G.R. No. 140484

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari seeking nullification of RTC Decision and Orders in an annulment case (Civil Case No. 180-V-98).

**Facts:**

*   Lamberto Castro (Respondent) filed for annulment against Isabelita Castro (Petitioner) based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.
*   Summons allegedly served via substituted service (through nephew).
*   Petitioner failed to answer; State Prosecutor investigated for collusion (none found).
*   Respondent presented evidence *ex parte*; clinical psychologist testified Petitioner was psychologically incapacitated.
*   RTC granted annulment.
*   Petitioner moved to set aside the judgment, alleging lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons.
*   RTC initially granted partial reconsideration, allowing Petitioner to present evidence.
*   Petitioner sought postponement of the hearing, which was ignored; RTC then affirmed the original Decision.
*   Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied, and her Notice of Appeal was dismissed.
*   Judgment became final and executory.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the RTC's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Psychological incapacity as ground for annulment.
*   **Rules of Court (Service of Summons):** Proper service of summons required for the court to obtain jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.
*   **Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages (A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC):** Sec. 24(b) specifically addresses the effect of death of a party post-judgment.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Legal Recourse:** The decision against Petitioner is final and executory.
*   **Impact on Estate:** The ruling impacts the parties and their successors in interest during estate settlement.
*   **Risk of Collusion:** Allegation of annulment to facilitate a second marriage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Defining psychological incapacity.
*   **Francisco Motors Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 100812, June 25, 1999, 309 SCRA 72:** Cited regarding voluntary submission to court jurisdiction despite defective service of summons.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, Section 24:** Rule governing annulment proceedings and effect of party's death.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points of Discussion:**

*   **Validity of Service of Summons:** Petitioner disputes service via nephew, raising questions about compliance with substituted service requirements. This goes to the heart of the court's jurisdiction.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence for Psychological Incapacity:** Petitioner argues the evidence presented was insufficient to prove psychological incapacity.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** Arguably, the denial of the postponement and subsequent affirmance of the decision without hearing Petitioner's evidence raises due process concerns.
*   **Finality and Execution:** The court emphasizes the finality of the judgment and the death of the private respondent, which strengthens its conclusion.

**Potential Arguments & Further Investigation:**

*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** A strong argument could have been made regarding the defective service of summons. This is a key element impacting the validity of the entire proceedings.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The court's summary denial of the postponement and failure to allow Petitioner to present evidence, especially after initially granting reconsideration, is a potential due process violation.
*   **Collusion Concerns:** The State Prosecutor's report finding no collusion is superficial without a thorough investigation. It does not preclude collusion.
*   **Consideration of Expert Witness:** While the psychologist was qualified, the fact remains the petitioner was not given the opportunity to contest findings by bringing their own expert.
