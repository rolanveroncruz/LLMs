## Legal Document Summary: *Iligan Cement Corporation v. ILIASCOR Employees and Workers Union* (G.R. No. 158956)

This is a labor dispute concerning the regularization and illegal dismissal of employees (Respondents) initially hired by Iligan Industrial and Agency Services Corporation (ILIASCOR), a job contractor of Iligan Cement Corporation (Petitioner).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the NLRC's finding that Petitioner was the *de facto* employer of Respondents during the period August 2, 2000 to November 15, 2000.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** Vedali General Services (Vedali), through which Petitioner hired Respondents, was deemed a **labor-only contractor**. Petitioner failed to prove Vedali possessed sufficient capital or control over the work. Citing Section 4(f), Rule VIII-A, Book III, of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, labor-only contracting is defined.
*   **Regularization:** As the principal employer, Petitioner was deemed to have directly employed the Respondents, entitling them to regularization under Article 106(2) of the Labor Code (citing *Sonza v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation, G.R. No. 138051*).
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The SC affirmed the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal, noting Petitioner failed to show any valid cause for termination under Articles 279, 281, 282-284, Labor Code, nor did they afford Respondents due process (notice and hearing, citing *Salaw v. NLRC, G.R. No. 90786*). The failure to comply with both substantive and procedural requirements renders the termination illegal.
*   **Remedies:** The SC upheld the NLRC's award of full backwages and separation pay to Respondents, but noted that the Petitioner was not liable for CBA differential.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable as the employer and is therefore responsible for the reliefs and damages stemming from the illegal dismissal of the employees. Specifically, the company is ordered to pay full back wages and separation pay to the illegally dismissed workers.
*   Iliocor is liable for CBA differential and is to answer the obligation that arises out of the employment contract.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The finding of labor-only contracting exposes the Petitioner to liabilities and penalties associated with illegal contracting under the Labor Code.
*   The failure to produce a service contract with Vedali proved critical.
*   The decision emphasizes the importance of proper corporate authorization for verification of pleadings, as the initial procedural defects nearly resulted in dismissal. The Court highlighted a need for substantial justice and flexibility with such rules in labour disputes (citing *Paul Lee Tan, Andrew Tanchi, Jr. et al v. Paul Sycip and Merritto Lim, G.R. No. 153468* and *Havtor Management Phils., Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 146336*).

**Ambiguities & Concerns:**

*   The finding that the Packhouse manager hired the Respondents appears to rely heavily on the Petitioner's failure to deny, rather than affirmative proof of the fact.

**Conclusion:**

The decision emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to labor laws, especially concerning contracting arrangements. Companies must ensure that their contractors are legitimate and possess the necessary capital, control, and business independence to avoid being deemed a labor-only contractor, with corresponding liabilities for direct employment and illegal dismissal. The decision also underscores the requirement of procedural and substantive due process when terminating employees.
