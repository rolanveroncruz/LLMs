## Legal Document Summary: *Fidel O. Chua and Filiden Realty and Development Corporation vs. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company, et al.* (G.R. No. 182311, August 19, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of a damages action (Civil Case No. CV-05-0402) on the ground of forum shopping.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Petitioners (Chua and Filiden) obtained loans from Respondent Metrobank, secured by a real estate mortgage (REM) on properties. The REM was repeatedly amended to reflect increased liabilities.
*   **Debt Settlement Agreement:** A debt settlement agreement was entered into to restructure the loan obligations.
*   **Foreclosure:** Upon failure to pay, Metrobank initiated extrajudicial foreclosure of the REM.
*   **Injunction (Civil Case No. CV-01-0207):** Petitioners filed a complaint for injunction (TRO/Preliminary Injunction/Damages) against Metrobank and Atty. Celestra (foreclosure agent) to stop the auction sale. TRO was granted, expired, and the sale was rescheduled.
*   **Contested Auction Sale:** RTC initially issued an Order for the auction to be reset but the auction proceeded anyway. A Certificate of Sale was issued to Metrobank. Petitioners alleged the Certificate of Sale was falsified, and the sale was conducted in disobedience to the court order.
*   **Amended Complaint (Civil Case No. CV-01-0207):** Petitioners filed an Amended Complaint, adding the Register of Deeds as a defendant and alleging falsification of the Certificate of Sale, seeking damages and an injunction.
*   **Separate Damages Action (Civil Case No. CV-05-0402):** Petitioners filed a separate Verified Complaint for Damages (actual, moral, exemplary) against Metrobank and its lawyers (Atty. Celestra, Viray, Miranda, and Maynigo) in another RTC branch, alleging the false appearance of the auction sale caused them losses.
*   **Consolidation and Dismissal:** Petitioners moved to consolidate both cases. Metrobank opposed, arguing forum shopping. The court granted consolidation but subsequently dismissed the damages action (CV-05-0402) on the ground of forum shopping.
*  **Forum Shopping:** Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Court

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal, holding that the filing of both the injunction case with claim for damages and separate damages action (CV-05-0402) constitutes forum shopping. Petitioners split their cause of action by seeking damages in both cases based on the same wrongful act (the alleged improper/fictitious foreclosure sale). This violates Sections 3 and 4, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court. The Court relied on *Feliciano v. Villasin, G.R. No. 174929, 27 June 2008, 556 SCRA 348, 370*, defining forum shopping, and *Joseph v. Bautista, G.R. No. 41423, 23 February 1989, 170 SCRA 540, 544* defining cause of action.  The Court noted the Petitioners admission in their Motion to Consolidate that both cases involved the same parties, the same central issue, and the same subject property, viz.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligation to avoid forum shopping by consolidating actions arising from the same cause. Liability for costs of the dismissed action.
*   **Respondent Metrobank:** No immediate liability, but potential for liability depending on the outcome of the remaining injunction case (CV-01-0207).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Outcome of Injunction Case (CV-01-0207):** The remaining risk hinges on the success of the injunction case. If the foreclosure sale is declared invalid, Metrobank's title to the properties will be jeopardized.
*   **Ambiguity of Damages in Injunction Case:** Although damages are claimed in the injunction case, the exact nature and amount remain uncertain. The court has not yet ruled on the validity and extent of those damages.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Section 5:** Forum shopping

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Validity of the Auction Sale:** The central contentious point is the validity of the foreclosure sale. Petitioners claim it was falsified and/or conducted in violation of a court order. Metrobank contends it was valid.
*   **Damages Claims:** The amount and basis for damages are disputed. Metrobank argues there is no basis for the damages claimed due to the alleged forum shopping.
