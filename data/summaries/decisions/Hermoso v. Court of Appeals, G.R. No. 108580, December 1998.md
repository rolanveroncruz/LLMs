**Case Summary: *Hermoso v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 108580, December 29, 1998**

**Nature of the Case:** This is a legal redemption case involving co-owners of a parcel of land. Petitioners (Clarita and Victoria Hermoso) sought to redeem undivided shares of the land sold by Clarita's sons, Agustinito and Danilo Hermoso, to private respondents (the Palaganas spouses).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**
*   **Co-ownership vs. Partition:** The central issue is whether the property was still under co-ownership at the time of the sale. If so, petitioners would have the right of legal redemption under Article 1620 and 1088 of the Civil Code. The Court must determine if a prior "Agreement" (Exhibit 1-A) constituted a valid partition.
*   **Validity of the "Agreement" (Exhibit 1-A):** The Court must assess whether the Agreement was a binding partition of the land or merely a preliminary scheme for future division. Critically, Consolacion Hermoso, holding 2/3 of the property, was not a party to this agreement.
*   **Notice of Sale and Timeliness of Redemption:** Article 1623 of the Civil Code requires written notice of the sale to co-owners to trigger the 30-day redemption period. The court must determine when the petitioners received proper notice and whether their redemption attempt was timely.
*   **Good Faith of Vendees:** The Court considers the Palaganas' knowledge of the Hermoso family dynamics, prior attempted sales, and their role in concealing the sale from the petitioners to determine their good faith in the transaction.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1088, 1620, 1623:** These articles govern the right of legal redemption for co-heirs and co-owners, including the requirement of written notice and the 30-day redemption period.
*   **Estrada v. Reyes, 33 Phil. 31 (1915):** Discusses the purpose of legal redemption which is to reduce the number of participants until the community is terminated.
*   **Caro v. Court of Appeals, 113 SCRA 10 (1982); Cornejo v. Court of Appeals, 16 SCRA 775 (1966); Lim Tuico v. Cu-Unjieng, 21 Phil. 493 (1912):** Defines the period of legal redemption and explains that the right of redemption is not prescriptive.
*   **Conejero v. Court of Appeals:** Ruled that a consignation of the tendered price is not necessary as long as a valid tender is present.
*   **Mariano v. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 736 (1993):** Confirms the application of legal redemption and a valid tender.
*   **Alonzo v. IAC, 150 SCRA 259 (1987):** Indicates the side the resolution of the issues fall which is based on the righting of justice.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Agreement" (Exhibit 1-A):** Its interpretation as a binding partition is questionable given Consolacion Hermoso's non-participation. If deemed merely a future plan, the property remained under co-ownership.
*   **Lack of Written Notice:** The lack of formal written notice from the vendors (Agustinito and Danilo) is a significant point favoring the petitioners' claim that the redemption period was not properly triggered. The Vendees are required to give a notice in writing to give the other co-owners all the circumstances of the sale by his co-owners and the terms and the validity of the alienation.
*   **Vendees' Good Faith:** The Palaganas' prior knowledge, concealment, and exploitation of the brothers' financial difficulties raise concerns about their good faith, potentially impacting the court's equitable considerations.

**Court Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's decision, ruling in favor of the petitioners. The Court found that the property was still under co-ownership due to the lack of a valid partition, particularly Consolacion Hermoso's non-participation in the "Agreement". The Court held that the written notice requirement of Article 1623 was not met, and the petitioners acted timely in offering to redeem the property upon discovering the sale. The Palaganas' bad faith also influenced the decision, leading the Court to prioritize justice and equity.
