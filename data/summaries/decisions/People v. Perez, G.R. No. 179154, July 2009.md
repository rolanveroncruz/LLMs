## Legal Document Summary: People v. Perez, G.R. No. 179154 (2009)

This is a criminal case involving the appeal of Roger Perez and Danilo Perez, who were convicted of murder by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) and affirmed with modification by the Court of Appeals (CA). The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, qualified by treachery, as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
*   **Facts:** Appellants were found guilty of stabbing Fulgencio Cuysona to death. Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony of the stabbing. Danilo Perez confessed to the crime but claimed sole responsibility. Roger Perez claimed alibi.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of murder, sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua, and ordered to pay damages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC decision, with modification to include exemplary damages.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Both appellants found criminally liable for murder under Article 248 of the RPC.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment).
*   **Civil Liability:** Joint and several liability to the heirs of the victim for:
    *   Indemnity for death (P50,000.00)
    *   Actual damages (P39,877.00)
    *   Moral damages (P50,000.00)
    *   Exemplary damages (P25,000.00)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Weight of Eyewitness Testimony:** The defense challenged the credibility of the eyewitnesses. The court gives significant weight to the positive and consistent testimonies of eyewitnesses.
*   **Alibi vs. Identification:** Alibi raised by Roger Perez rejected. A critical factor in rejecting the alibi was its inconsistency with the physical proximity to the crime and the corroborating details offered by testimony.
*   **Danilo Perez's Confession:** Danilo's confession did not absolve Roger. The prosecution presented direct evidence implicating Roger.
*   **Proof of Corpus Delicti:** Defense argued lack of proof of corpus delicti due to absence of the Medico-Legal Officer's testimony. The court ruled that corpus delicti can be proven through witness testimony even without the medico-legal report. *People v. Quimzon, G.R. No. 133541, April 14, 2004, 427 SCRA 261, 270-271*.
*   **Conspiracy:** Conspiracy was established through circumstantial evidence, specifically the coordinated actions of the appellants, *Mangangey v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 147773-74, February 18, 2008, 546 SCRA 51, 66.*
*   **Motive:** The defense argued the lack of motive. The court ruled that motive is not necessary when there is direct evidence. *People v. Ducabo, G.R. No. 175594, September 28, 2007, 534 SCRA 458, 472-473.*
*   **Treachery and Abuse of Superior Strength:** The court ruled that the killing was qualified by treachery and abuse of superior strength, converting the crime to murder.
