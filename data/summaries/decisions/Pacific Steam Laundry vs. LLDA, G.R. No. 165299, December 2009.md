**Case Summary: Pacific Steam Laundry, Inc. vs. Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), G.R. No. 165299, December 18, 2009**

**Legal Issue:** Whether LLDA has the implied power to impose fines for violations of effluent standards under PD 984 and EO 927, and whether such implied power constitutes an undue delegation of legislative power.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 984 (National Pollution Control Decree of 1976):** Prohibits discharge of pollutants and provides for penalties.  Section 9 outlines penalties for violation, setting a fine *not exceeding* P1,000 per day.
*   **RA 4850 (Laguna Lake Development Authority Act), as amended by PD 813:** Mandates LLDA to manage and develop Laguna Lake with due regard for environmental control and pollution prevention.
*   **EO 927:** Grants LLDA additional powers, including issuing standards, rules, and regulations for sewage and waste disposal, compelling discontinuance of pollution, and issuing permits. Section 4(i) grants LLDA the power to "exercise such powers and perform such other functions as may be necessary to carry out its duties and responsibilities".
*   **EO 192:** Created the Pollution Adjudication Board (PAB) under the DENR, assuming NPCC's adjudicatory functions under RA 3931 and PD 984, specifically with respect to Section 6 letters e, f, g, j, k, and p of P.D. 984.
*   **LLDA's Findings:** Pacific Steam Laundry discharged untreated wastewater violating effluent standards, and operated without required LLDA clearances and permits.  Wastewater sampling on 5 Sept 2001 showed non-compliance with TSS, BOD, Oil/Grease, and Color Units.  Penalty was computed from date of initial sampling until re-sampling showed compliance.

**Liabilities:**

*   LLDA imposed a fine of P1,000 per day for discharging pollutive wastewater, computed from September 5, 2001, to May 17, 2002 (date of request for re-sampling), totaling P172,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Implied Power:**  Petitioner argued LLDA lacks the express power to impose fines, as that power resides solely with the PAB after EO 192. The Court found that LLDA's power to impose fines is implied in the exercise of its function as a regulatory and quasi-judicial body with respect to pollution cases in the Laguna Lake region.
*   **Delegation of Legislative Power:** The petitioner contends that if LLDA is deemed to have implied power to impose penalties, then LLDA will have unfettered discretion to determine for itself the penalties it may impose, which will amount to undue delegation of legislative power.
*   **Daily Penalty Calculation:**  The method of calculating the daily penalty was a point of contention. LLDA calculated based on 5 working days per week.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Laguna Lake Development Authority v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 110120, 16 March 1994:** The Court ruled that adjudication of pollution cases generally pertains to the Pollution Adjudication Board, except where a special law, such as the LLDA Charter, provides for another forum. This supports LLDA's jurisdiction within its specified region.
*   **The Alexandra Condominium Corporation v. Laguna Lake Development Authority, G.R. No. 169228, 11 September 2009:** While the case did not directly challenge LLDA's power to fine, the Supreme Court affirmed a Court of Appeals decision that sustained LLDA's order to pay a fine for pollutive discharge, implicitly acknowledging LLDA's power.
*   The court cited american jurisprudence regarding agencies' authority should be liberally construed in order to permit the agency to carry out its statutory responsibilities.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding LLDA's power to impose fines and finding no undue delegation of legislative power.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The Court emphasizes LLDA's regulatory and quasi-judicial role within the Laguna Lake region as justification for the implied power to fine.
*   The Court notes that fines were imposed according to standards prescribed under PD 984 (P1,000 per day), thus the LLDA's power to impose fines is not unrestricted.
