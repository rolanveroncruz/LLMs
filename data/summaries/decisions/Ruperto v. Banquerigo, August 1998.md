## Legal Document Summary: Ruperto vs. Banquerigo, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1154

**Type:** Administrative Matter against a Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) Judge.

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Renato Alvaro Ruperto
*   **Respondent:** Judge Tirso F. Banquerigo (MCTC of Tayasan Jimmalud, acting in MCTC of Bindoy-Ayungon-Manjuyod)

**Allegations:** Ignorance of the law, malicious prosecution, grave abuse of discretion, and malicious delay in the administration of justice.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Ejectment Case (Civil Case No. A-178):** Alleged violation of the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure. Specifically, failure to promptly act on the motion to summarily decide the case after the defendant spouses failed to file their answer within the reglementary period.
*   **Criminal Cases (Qualified Theft):** Alleged malicious prosecution based on the issuance of a warrant of arrest which the complainant claimed was inappropriate given the facts.

**Liabilities & Findings:**
*   **Ignorance of the Law (Ejectment Case):** The Supreme Court found Judge Banquerigo liable for failing to comply with the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure. Cites *Rural Bank of Macalalag, Inc. vs. Maniwang* (A.M. No. MTJ-93-799, May 13, 1994, 232 SCRA 414) regarding a judge's duty to decide cases under the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure after a defendant's failure to answer. The Court found that the judge's disregard of the Rule frustrated the purpose of the law.
*   **Malicious Prosecution (Criminal Cases):** The Supreme Court *did not* find Judge Banquerigo liable for malicious prosecution. The Court accepted that the warrant of arrest was issued based on a *prima facie* case established during the preliminary investigation, sustained by the Provincial Prosecutorâ€™s Office. Subsequent dismissal of the cases did not negate the propriety of the warrant's issuance.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Workload as Mitigation:** Judge Banquerigo's defense of being an acting judge in multiple courts was partially accepted as a mitigating factor, but it does not excuse ignorance of the law. The "multiple assignments, in one way or another, affected his efficient handling of cases." This could be interpreted as implicitly acknowledging inefficiency, which could be problematic in future cases.
*   **Discretion vs. Mandate under Summary Procedure:** The ruling reinforces the *mandatory* nature of certain procedures under the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure. The Judge's asserted "interest of justice and equity" in setting the motion for hearing was not deemed sufficient to excuse the failure to act promptly.
*   **Lack of Malice:** The relatively lenient penalty (reprimand) hinges on the absence of malice, corrupt motives, or improper considerations. If future administrative cases reveal such elements, the penalty will likely be more severe.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Revised Rule on Summary Procedure, Section 6:** Effect of failure to answer.
*   **Rules of Court, Section 4, Rule 18:** Application where there are multiple defendants.
*   **Rural Bank of Macalalag, Inc. vs. Maniwang (A.M. No. MTJ-93-799, May 13, 1994, 232 SCRA 414):** Relevant to a Judge's duty to decide cases under the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure.
*   **Miguel Abarquez vs. Judge Bienvenido M. Rebosura (A.M. No. MTJ-94-986):** Highlighting the importance of Municipal Trial Courts to the "common tao".

**Outcome:** Judge Tirso F. Banquerigo was severely reprimanded with a stern warning.
