## Legal Document Summary: *Moreno v. San Sebastian College-Recoletos*

**Case:** *Jackqui R. Moreno v. San Sebastian College-Recoletos, Manila*, G.R. No. 175283, March 28, 2008 (573 Phil. 533)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the NLRC and reinstating the Labor Arbiter's decision upholding Moreno's dismissal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **SSC-R Faculty Manual Section 2.2 Art. II:** Requires administrative permission for full-time faculty to teach part-time elsewhere, with reporting requirements and limits on teaching load.
*   **Employment Contract Clause 5:** Prohibits accepting teaching assignments without prior written permission from the President.
*   **Labor Code Article 282:** Lists just causes for termination, including serious misconduct and willful disobedience.
*   **Section 45. Full-time and Part-time Faculty.** As a general rule, all private schools shall employ full-time academic personnel consistent with the levels of instruction. Full-time academic personnel are those meeting all the following requirements: x x x x d) Who have no other remunerative occupation elsewhere requiring regular hours of work that will conflict with the working hours in the school; and e) Who are not teaching full-time in any other educational institution. All teaching personnel who do not meet the foregoing qualifications are considered part-time.

**Facts:** Moreno, a tenured faculty member and department chair at SSC-R, was dismissed for violating the school's policy against unauthorized external teaching engagements. She admitted to teaching at other institutions without permission, citing financial need.

**Issues:**

1.  Was Moreno's dismissal proper and lawful?
2.  Is Moreno entitled to the reliefs she seeks?

**Holdings:**

*   **Dismissal Illegal:** The Court held that while Moreno committed misconduct (violating the school policy), it did not rise to the level of "serious misconduct" or "willful disobedience" under Article 282(a) of the Labor Code, because the wrongful intent was not sufficiently proven by SSC-R.
*   **Lack of Wrongful Intent:** The Court highlighted SSC-R's failure to prove that Moreno had corrupt motivations violating the aforementioned policy.
*   **Disproportionate Penalty:** Even if termination was a listed penalty, the Court found it disproportionate given Moreno's admission, first offense, previous good performance, financial circumstances, and the school's failure to prove any material damage. Reference: *VH Manufacturing Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 379 Phil. 444, 451 (2000).*
*   **Procedural Due Process Upheld:** The Court affirmed that procedural due process was followed (twin notices, opportunity to be heard).
*   **Remedy:** The Court reversed the CA. Moreno to be reinstated without loss of seniority rights and privileges. No backwages were awarded due to SSC-R's good faith, relying on the precedent *Durabuilt Recapping Plant & Co. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. L-76746, 27 July 1987, 152 SCRA 328.*

**Obligations:**

*   **SSC-R:** Obligated to reinstate Moreno to her former position without loss of seniority or privileges. However, no backwages are due.
*   **Moreno:** Expected to comply with SSC-R's policies going forward.

**Liabilities:**

*   SSC-R avoided liability for backwages and damages due to a finding of good faith.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Defining "Wrongful Intent":** The Court's emphasis on proving wrongful intent for serious misconduct creates ambiguity. Future cases may hinge on the specific evidence required to establish such intent.
*   **Discretion in Penalty:** While the Faculty Manual specified dismissal, the Court emphasized the employment contract allowed for discretion (suspension or dismissal), potentially creating a conflict if policies are rigidly applied.
*   **Future Misconduct:** Although Moreno was reinstated, any further violation of school policy could be subject to stricter penalties given her prior transgression.
