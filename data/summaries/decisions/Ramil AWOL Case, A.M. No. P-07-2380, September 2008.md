**Case Summary: A.M. No. P-07-2380 (Formerly A.M. No. 06-10-613-RTC)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Lydia A. Ramil, Court Stenographer III, for Absence Without Leave (AWOL), violation of OCA Circular No. 7-2003 regarding DTR/bundy card submission, and insubordination.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **OCA Circular No. 7-2003:** Mandates timely and accurate submission of DTRs/bundy cards by all court personnel. Failure warrants withholding of salaries/benefits. Ramil failed to submit her bundy cards beginning November 2005.
*   **AWOL Charge:** Initially, Ramil was dropped from the rolls for AWOL.  This was later reversed upon submission of evidence (Calendar of Cases, Travel Order, Performance Rating, Letters of COC) suggesting she was not continuously absent for 30 days.
*   **Incomplete/Conflicting DTRs:**  Submitted DTRs had incomplete/handwritten entries, and conflicting entries existed. Ramil claimed she "forgot" to punch in.
*   **OCA Directives:** Ramil failed to comply with repeated OCA directives to submit bundy cards, despite warnings.
*   **Charges:** The Court found Ramil guilty of:
    *   Simple Neglect of Duty (failure to properly attend to DTR duties)
    *   Insubordination (failure to comply with OCA directives)

**Obligations:**

*   Court personnel have an *affirmative obligation* to comply with OCA Circulars, specifically OCA Circular No. 7-2003, and directives from the OCA.
*   Accurate and timely submission of DTRs/bundy cards is a mandatory requirement.
*   Obeying orders of the Supreme Court is a duty of every judiciary officer and employee, without delay.

**Liabilities:**

*   Violation of OCA circulars and directives constitutes insubordination and/or neglect of duty. *Marata v. Fernandez, A.M. No. P-04-1871, August 9, 2005, 466 SCRA 45.*
*   Incorrect entries in DTRs/bundy cards constitutes simple negligence. *Re: Anonymous Complaint Against Ms. Rowena Marinduque, Casual Utility Worker II, Assigned at PHILJA Development Center , Tagaytay City, A.M. No. 2004-35-SC, January 23, 2006, 479 SCRA 343.*
*   Penalties range from suspension to dismissal, based on the severity and frequency of the offense.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in Assessing Neglect:** The definition of "simple neglect of duty" involves a degree of subjectivity in assessing carelessness or indifference.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court gave weight to Ramil's length of service and status as a first-time offender.  However, the weight assigned to these factors could be challenged if similar cases are treated differently.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article XI (Public Accountability):** Basis for the high standard of conduct required of public officials.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Specifically, Section 52 B, Rule IV (less grave offenses), Sections 54 and 55 on imposition of penalties. *Civil Service Commission, Memorandum Circular No. 19, s. 1999.*
*  **Garcia v. Bada, A.M. No. P-07-2311, August 23, 2007, 530 SCRA 779.** Every official must truthfully and accurately enter his/her times of arrival in and departure from the office.
*   **Servino v. Adolfo, A.M. No. P-06-2204, November 30, 2006, 509 SCRA 42:** Public service requires utmost integrity and discipline.

**Conclusion:**

The Court found Ramil guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty and Insubordination and ordered her suspended for one month and one day without pay. COC Velasco was also ordered to show cause why no disciplinary action should be taken against him. The key takeaway is the importance of strict adherence to administrative rules and regulations, particularly regarding DTR/bundy card procedures and compliance with OCA directives. This case serves as a warning that failure to comply can lead to administrative sanctions, even for first-time offenders, although mitigating circumstances may be considered.
