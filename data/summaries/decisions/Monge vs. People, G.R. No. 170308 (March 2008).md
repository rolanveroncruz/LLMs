## Legal Document Summary: *Galo Monge v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 170308, March 7, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming Galo Monge's conviction for violation of Section 68 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 705 (as amended by E.O. No. 277), specifically illegal possession and transport of lumber, and challenging the discharge of co-accused Edgar Potencio as state witness.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 68 of P.D. No. 705, as amended by E.O. No. 277. Illegal possession and transportation of 77 board feet of mahogany lumber without necessary permit/license or other documents.
*   **Factual Background:** Monge and Potencio were apprehended transporting mahogany without authorization. Potencio was later discharged as state witness and testified against Monge.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Convicted Monge.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed conviction, modifying the penalty.
*   **Issue on Appeal:** Propriety of Potencio's discharge as state witness and Monge's guilt.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Monge's Liability:**  The Court affirms that Monge is liable under Section 68 of PD 705 for *possession* of forest products without the required legal documents, regardless of ownership or intent.  The law is *malum prohibitum*, making good faith irrelevant. Failure to present the Certificate of Lumber Origin (DENR Administrative Order No. 59 series of 1993) sealed Monge's fate.
*   **Potencio's Discharge:** Court upholds the discharge of Potencio.
*   **DENR:** Not explicitly stated, but the offense directly damages the DENR due to the unauthorized taking and transportation of forest products.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Challenge to Potencio's Discharge:** Monge argues Potencio was not the least guilty and his testimony was not absolutely necessary. The Court firmly rejects this, citing *Yu v. Presiding Judge, RTC of Tagaytay City* and other jurisprudence establishing trial court discretion in discharging co-accused as state witnesses. This argument is deemed raised too late, as challenges should be made during trial.
*   **Double Jeopardy Concerns:** The Court emphasizes that discharging an accused to be a state witness operates as an acquittal, barring future prosecution for the same offense (*Rule 119, Sec. 18*).
*   **Lack of Mens Rea:** Monge's defense relies on a lack of intent, claiming he was only assisting Potencio. However, the Court emphasizes that P.D. No. 705 is a special penal statute that punishes acts *malum prohibitum*. Therefore, intent is not required, creating a strict liability standard.
*   **No ambiguous clauses**. All issues raised by the petitioner was debunked by the court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 705 (as amended by E.O. No. 277), Section 68:**  The primary statutory basis for the charge.
*   **DENR Administrative Order No. 59 series of 1993, Section 3:** Defines the necessary documents (Certificate of Lumber Origin) for legal transport of lumber.
*   **People v. Que, 333 Phil. 582, 594 (1996):** Distinguishes between illegal cutting/gathering and illegal possession, highlighting that possession alone without required documents is a distinct offense.
*   **People v. Dator, 398 Phil. 109, 121 (2000):** Reaffirms that P.D. No. 705 punishes acts *malum prohibitum*, making good faith an unreliable defense.
*   **Yu v. Presiding Judge, RTC of Tagaytay City, Br. 18, G.R. No. 142848, 30 June 2006, 494 SCRA 101, 116:**  Establishes the trial court's discretion in discharging an accused as state witness, subject to Rule 119, Sec. 17 requirements.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 119, Sections 17 & 18:** Governs the discharge of an accused as state witness and its effect as an acquittal.

**Conclusion:**

The decision affirms Monge's conviction based on the strict liability nature of P.D. No. 705, emphasizing that mere possession of undocumented forest products constitutes a violation. The Court upheld the trial court's discretion in discharging Potencio as a state witness, foreclosing any challenge based on double jeopardy principles. The significant risk is the strict liability aspect of the law, which removes intent as a mitigating factor.
