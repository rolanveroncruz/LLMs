**Legal Document Summary**

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Romy Lim y Miranda* G.R. No. 231989, September 04, 2018

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Romy Lim for violating Sections 11 (illegal possession) and 5 (illegal sale) of Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Lim was charged with illegal possession of 0.02 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in Criminal Case No. 2010-1073 and illegal sale of 0.02 gram of shabu to a poseur-buyer in Criminal Case No. 2010-1074. Co-accused Eldie Gorres (stepson) was acquitted.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Buy-bust operation based on a confidential informant's tip. Poseur-buyer purchased shabu from Lim. After pre-arranged signal, team arrested Lim and Gorres. Lim was found with buy-bust money and additional shabu.  Marking and inventory conducted.
*   **Defense's Version:** Denied the charges, claiming illegal entry, pointing of firearms and that evidence was planted.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Lim guilty on both counts, sentencing him to 12 years and 1 day to 13 years (illegal possession) and life imprisonment (illegal sale), plus fines. Gorres was acquitted due to insufficient evidence of conspiracy.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** REVERSED and SET ASIDE the CA and RTC decisions.  Lim was ACQUITTED due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Issues & Rationale for Acquittal:**

*   **Chain of Custody Rule (Section 21 of R.A. 9165 as amended):** The Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs.

    *   Contradicting testimonies on the marking.
    *   Crucially, the inventory and photographing of the seized items were NOT conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation, nor in the presence of the accused, an elected public official, and representatives from the Department of Justice (DOJ) or media as mandated by Section 21 of R.A. 9165. The team leader of the buy-bust operation had no intention of bringing a barangay official to the operation as the officer stated “We do not contact them because we do not trust them. They might leak our information.”
    *   The court emphasized that not one of the required third-party witnesses was present during the seizure, marking, physical inventory and taking of pictures.
    *   Officer Orellan did not know the crime lab personnel the seized evidence was delivered to.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution's explanations for non-compliance (late at night, raining, unsafe, inability to secure witnesses) were deemed unacceptable as there was no genuine and sufficient attempt to comply with the law. The law enforcers were not under any time constraint or any urgent reason to secure the attendance of the required witnesses.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The court stated that the discrepancy in the prosecution evidence on the identity of the seized evidence affected the “proof of corpus delicti without which the accused must be acquitted.” Because of the constitutional law points of view, if “the prosecution’s failure to establish with moral certainty all the elements of the crime and to identify the accused as the perpetrator signify that it failed to overturn the constitutional presumption of innocence that every accused enjoys in a criminal prosecution.” As such, there was no basis to apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.
*   **Mandatory Police:**

    *   In the sworn statements/affidavits, the apprehending/seizing officers must state their compliance with the requirements of Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, as amended, and its IRR.
    *   In case of non-observance of the provision, the apprehending/seizing officers must state the justification or explanation therefor as well as the steps they have taken in order to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized/confiscated items.
    *   If there is no justification or explanation expressly declared in the sworn statements or affidavits, the investigating fiscal must not immediately file the case before the court. Instead, he or she must refer the case for further preliminary investigation in order to determine the (non) existence of probable cause.
    *   If the investigating fiscal filed the case despite such absence, the court may exercise its discretion to either refuse to issue a commitment order (or warrant of arrest) or dismiss the case outright for lack of probable cause in accordance with Section 5, Rule 112, Rules of Court.

**Legal Analysis & Potential Risks:**

*   **Case Law Emphasis:** The decision underscores the strict interpretation of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its IRR, referencing *Mallillin v. People*, *People v. Sipin*, and many others.
*   **Statutory References:** Focus is on the amended Section 21 of R.A. 9165, particularly the requirements for inventory and photographing in the presence of specified witnesses.
*   **Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The "justifiable grounds" clause in Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165 and its application is a key area of contention. The court explicitly rejects the prosecution's purported justifications, signaling a higher threshold for excusing non-compliance.
*   **Risk of Acquittal in Drug Cases:**  This case highlights the high risk of acquittal in drug cases if law enforcement fails to adhere meticulously to the chain of custody requirements and to provide convincing justifications for any deviations. The new mandatory policies issued by the Supreme Court now places additional burden on law enforcement and the investigating fiscal in the cases before the court.
*   **"Planting" Evidence Concern:** Implicit in the decision is the ongoing concern regarding the potential for planting evidence in drug cases, necessitating the strict application of safeguards like the chain of custody rule.

**Concurring Opinions:**

*   **Justice Leonen:** Focused on the fact that, by definition, buy-bust operations are preplanned, deliberately arranged or calculated operations. As such, there were no excuses as to why law enforcement did not fully comply with all of Section 21’s requirements.
*   **Justice Caguioa:** Focused on the requirements that the required witnesses be physically present at the time or near the place of arrest/apprehension so that “they can be ready to witness the inventory and photographing of the seized and confiscated drugs.”
