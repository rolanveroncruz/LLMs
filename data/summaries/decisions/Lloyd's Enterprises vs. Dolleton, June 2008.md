**Case Summary: Lloyd's Enterprises and Credit Corporation vs. Sps. Dolleton, G.R. No. 171373, June 18, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's nullification of a property sale and subsequent mortgage foreclosure.

**Key Issue:** Whether Lloyd's Enterprises and Credit Corporation (LECC) was a mortgagee in good faith.

**Facts:**
*   Sps. Dolleton (Respondents) owned property covered by TCT No. 153554.
*   Respondents purportedly sold the property to Gagan, who obtained TCT No. 197220. Respondents allege the Deed of Sale was a forgery.
*   Gagan mortgaged the property to LECC twice.  The second mortgage led to foreclosure proceedings after Gagan defaulted.  LECC was the highest bidder.
*   Sps. Dolleton filed suit to nullify the sale, mortgages, and foreclosure, alleging fraud.

**Ruling:**
*   SC affirmed the CA decision that LECC was NOT a mortgagee in good faith.
*   RTC decision was reinstated including damages.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Nullification of Deed of Absolute Sale:**  The court found the Deed of Sale from the Dolletons to Gagan to be a forgery.
*   **Nullification of Mortgages and Foreclosure:** Because Gagan's title was invalid, the mortgages to LECC were deemed invalid, as was the subsequent foreclosure.
*   **Mortgagee in Good Faith:** The core issue revolves around LECC's status as a mortgagee in good faith.  The court found that LECC failed to exercise due diligence. This includes, in particular, failing to inquire into the rights/claims of those in possession (i.e., the tenants).
*   **Cross-Claim:** Gagan and Guevarra are ordered to pay jointly and severally LECC the amount of P645,000.00 (purchase price at foreclosure sale) plus legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of the RTC Decision.
*   **Damages:** LECC is liable for moral damages (P300,000), exemplary damages (P300,000), actual litigation expenses (P50,000) and attorney's fees (P100,000) to the respondents.
*   **Restitution:** LECC must reconvey the property to the Sps. Dolleton.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **LECC's Loss:** LECC bears the immediate loss of the property and the significant damages. Recovery from Gagan and Guevarra is likely to be difficult given their unknown whereabouts and potential lack of assets.
*   **Title Issues:** The property's title is now subject to further complications due to the fraudulent transfer and multiple encumbrances.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Expresscredit Financing Corporation v. Velasco, G.R. No. 156033:**  Establishes a higher standard of due diligence for financial institutions offering real estate loans.
*   **Agag v. Alpha Financing Corp., 455 Phil. 397 (2003):** The general rule that a purchaser or mortgagee of land is not required to look further than what appears on the face of the title does not apply when the purchaser or mortgagee is a financing institution.
*   **Cruz v. Bancom Finance Corporation:** Similar to *Agag*, reiterates the higher duty of diligence for banks and financing companies in real estate transactions.
*   **Adriano v. Pangilinan, 424 Phil. 578 (2002):** Discusses responsibility where a third party perpetrates fraud, and the impact of negligence on the parties involved.
*   **Cavite Development Bank v. Lim, 381 Phil. 355 (2000):** Concerns reduction of excessive moral and exemplary damages.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether LECC conducted "due diligence" is highly fact-dependent. The Court's finding that LECC should have investigated further despite a seemingly clean title is a significant point. The Court's view of "newly issued" TCT should prompt closer inspection.
*   The amount of attorney's fees and damages, while reinstated, could be subject to further arguments regarding reasonableness.
*   Enforceability of the cross-claim against Gagan and Guevarra is uncertain due to their absence.
