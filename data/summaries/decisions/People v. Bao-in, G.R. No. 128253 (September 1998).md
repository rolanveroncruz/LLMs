## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bao-In*, G.R. No. 128253 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction for violation of Section 8, Article II of R.A. 6425, as amended by R.A. 7659 (illegal possession of marijuana).

**Key Provision:** Reversal of the trial court's guilty verdict due to reasonable doubt regarding the accused's possession of the marijuana.

**Facts:** Accused Bao-In was arrested at a bus terminal after his companion, Mario, fled, leaving behind a bag containing marijuana. The prosecution presented conflicting testimonies regarding who was holding the bag.  The Solicitor General recommended acquittal.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court acquitted Bao-In, finding that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he possessed the marijuana.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Lack of Possession:** Key prosecution witness testimony (SPO3 Dulay) corroborated the accused's claim that Mario was holding the bag. Only one witness (SPO2 Peralta) testified that the accused held the bag, which contradicted other evidence.
*   **Lack of Conspiracy:** The prosecution failed to prove a conspiracy between Bao-In and Mario. Mere presence at the scene is insufficient for conspiracy conviction. There was no prior agreement. Mario's behavior suggested his sole knowledge of the bag's contents.
*   **Defense's Credibility:**  Bao-In's explanation that he was simply seeing Mario off was supported by the fact that he did not have a bus ticket.
*   **Standard of Proof:** Emphasized the high standard of proof required for criminal conviction and the principle that it is better to acquit a guilty person than convict an innocent one.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Conflicting Testimony:** Discrepancies in the prosecution's witness testimonies regarding who possessed the bag.  This internal inconsistency was crucial to the reversal.
*   **Lack of Intent:** The prosecution failed to establish the *animus possidendi* of the accused. It was not shown the Accused had the intention to own the bag.
