**Legal Document Summary: Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. v. Spouses Efren and Lolita Soriano (G.R. No. 211232)**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45).

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. (CCBPI)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Efren and Lolita Soriano

**Subject Matter:** Validity of a Real Estate Mortgage (REM) and subsequent foreclosure.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Validity of REM:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and Regional Trial Court (RTC) decisions, finding the REM to be valid, notwithstanding defects in its notarization.
    *   **Key Principle:** Registration of a REM is not essential to its validity *between the parties* (Art. 2125, Civil Code). Unregistered mortgages are binding on the mortgagor and mortgagee.
    *   **Defective Notarization:**  Notarization by a Clerk of Court *ex officio* for matters outside their official functions is improper. This reduces the REM deed to a private document.
    *   **Proof of Private Document:**  Since REM was reduced to a private document, the court applied Rule 132, Section 20, which requires proof of due execution and authenticity, and preponderance of evidence test.
    *  **Admission of Signature:**  Respondents admitted signing the REM deed, though alleging fraud. SC held that fraud was not adequately proven and due execution and genuineness of the REM deed was impliedly admitted by the respondents
*   **Foreclosure Validity:** Since the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the REM, the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings were also deemed valid. Personal notice to the mortgagor in extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not necessary (Act No. 3135, Sec. 3)

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents (Spouses Soriano) are bound by the REM agreement.
*   Respondents' claim for annulment of mortgage and foreclosure was dismissed.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents lost claim on nullification of foreclosure of property

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Allegation of Fraud:** The core of the respondents' argument rested on the claim that they were fraudulently induced into signing the REM.
*   **Notarization Defect:** The improper notarization, while not invalidating the agreement *between the parties*, could create issues in enforcement or against third parties had this been a relevant consideration (which it wasn't, given the suit was only between the parties).
*   **Lack of Personal Notice:**  While the Court stated that personal notice is not required for extrajudicial foreclosure, this remains a sensitive issue and a common basis for challenges to foreclosure proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2085, 2125, and 1338 of the Civil Code:** Essential elements of a mortgage and definition of fraud.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (P.D. 1529), Section 112:** Formal requirements for registrability of deeds.
*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:** Requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure (posting and publication of notice of sale).
*   **Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc., v. Ruth R. Diocares, et al.**
*   **Paradigm Development Corporation of the Philippines, v. Bank of the Philippine Islands**
*   **Gloria and Teresita Tan Ocampo v. Land Bank of the Philippines Urdaneta, Pangasinan Branch and Ex Officio Provincial Sheriff of Pangasinan**
*   **Lamberto Songco, v. George C. Sellner**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The respondents argued that that the titles were secured through machinations and manipulations of Defendant Reynaldo C. Cipriano as the General Manager.

**Recommendations/Further Analysis:**

*   Assess the documentation surrounding the original loan and the circumstances of the alleged fraudulent inducement, though the Supreme Court has already considered this evidence insufficient.
*   Confirm that the extrajudicial foreclosure complied with all requirements of Act No. 3135 (posting, publication, etc.).
