## Legal Document Summary: De Guzman v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 180048

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for certiorari assailing the COMELEC's disqualification of Roseller De Guzman from running for Vice-Mayor of Guimba, Nueva Ecija in the 2007 elections based on his dual citizenship. De Guzman, a naturalized US citizen, reacquired Philippine citizenship under RA 9225 but did not execute a separate personal and sworn renunciation of his US citizenship.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9225, Sec. 3:**  Outlines the process for reacquiring Philippine citizenship via oath of allegiance for natural-born Filipinos who lost citizenship through naturalization.
*   **RA 9225, Sec. 5(2):** Imposes an *additional* requirement for those seeking elective office: a *personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship* before an authorized officer at the time of filing the certificate of candidacy.  This is *separate* from the oath of allegiance.
*   **Local Government Code, Sec. 40(d):** Disqualifies those with dual citizenship from running for local elective positions.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Disqualification:** Failure to comply with the explicit renunciation requirement under RA 9225, Sec. 5(2) results in disqualification from holding elective office.
*   **Invalidity of Election Victory:** Despite initially winning an election protest, the disqualification renders the victory legally void.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Frivaldo v. COMELEC & Mercado v. Manzano:** These cases, which previously held that filing a certificate of candidacy with an oath of allegiance constituted renunciation, are *explicitly distinguished* and deemed *inapplicable* due to the stricter requirements of RA 9225.
*   **Japzon v. COMELEC & Jacot v. Dal and COMELEC:** These cases are cited to emphasize the **twin requirements** of RA 9225, Sec. 5(2):  (1) oath of allegiance; *and* (2) separate, sworn renunciation of foreign citizenship.
*   **Olanolan v. COMELEC:** Discusses when an issue becomes moot. Relevant here because COMELEC initially dismissed motion for reconsideration as moot due to De Guzman's election loss, a decision the Court finds to be grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Labo, Jr. v. COMELEC:** Citizenship is an indispensable requirement for holding an elective office.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central contention is the interpretation of RA 9225, specifically whether the oath of allegiance suffices as a renunciation of foreign citizenship. The Court clearly states it does *not*, establishing a higher standard.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Incumbency:** Individuals who reacquired citizenship under RA 9225 but did not properly renounce their foreign citizenship could face disqualification challenges *even after* being elected.
*   **Misinterpretation of RA 9225:**  Many may wrongly assume that taking the oath of allegiance alone is sufficient for holding office, creating a risk of future legal challenges.

**Summary of Holding:**  The Supreme Court *dismissed* De Guzman's petition. Despite reacquiring Philippine citizenship, his failure to execute a *separate, personal, and sworn renunciation* of his US citizenship, as explicitly required by RA 9225, Sec. 5(2), disqualified him from running for office. The COMELEC's dismissal of the motion for reconsideration was grave abuse of discretion, but the disqualification stands. The case unequivocally establishes that RA 9225 mandates a stricter standard for dual citizens seeking elective office than prior case law.
