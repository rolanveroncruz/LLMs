Here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Rebecca A. Barbo, et al. v. Commission on Audit (COA)*, G.R. No. 157542, October 10, 2008 (589 Phil. 289)

**Subject:** Petition for Certiorari seeking to annul COA Decision No. 2000-133 and Resolution dated February 27, 2003, affirming the disallowance of certain benefits and allowances paid to officials of the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) who were designated members of the Interim Board of Directors of the San Fernando Water District (SFWD).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Petitioners, as LWUA officials and interim SFWD board members, received Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA), Travel Allowance, Extraordinary & Miscellaneous Expense (EME), Christmas Bonus, Uniform Allowance, Rice Allowance, Medical and Dental Benefits, and Productivity Incentive Bonus from SFWD based on LWUA Board Resolution Nos. 313 (1995) and 39 (1996).
*   **COA Action:** COA Special Audit Team disallowed the payment of EME, Rice Allowance, Christmas Bonus, and Productivity Bonus received from 1994-1996, citing Sections 228, 162 and 163 of the Government Accounting and Auditing Manual (GAAM), Civil Service Commission (CSC) Resolution No. 954073, and Section 13 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 198 (Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973), as amended. COA ordered the refund of disallowed amounts.
*   **COA Rationale:** The COA based its ruling on the prohibition of additional, double, or indirect compensation for LWUA officers/employees serving on water district boards, other than per diems, as mandated by Section 13 of PD 198.
*   **Petitioners' Arguments:**
    *   CSC Resolution No. 954073 (Cruz v. Cabili) should not apply to them as they were not parties to the case.
    *   CSC lacked jurisdiction to issue such a resolution.
    *   DBM, not CSC, is the appropriate authority to rule on compensation.
    *   Certain benefits are not compensation (Christmas Bonus, Productivity Bonus, Rice Allowance, and Uniform Allowance).
    *   EME is reimbursement, not compensation.
    *   LWUA recognizes the right of water district directors to receive allowances and benefits.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court PARTIALLY GRANTED the petition.

*   **Affirmed COA Jurisdiction:** The Court affirmed the COA's authority to rule on the legality of the disbursement of government funds by water districts, citing Article IX, Section 2, Subdivision D of the 1987 Constitution and prior cases like *Rodolfo S. de Jesus [Catbalogan Water District] v. COA*.
*   **Upheld Disallowance:** The Court upheld the COA's disallowance of the benefits, reiterating that PD 198 expressly prohibits the grant of RATA, EME, and bonuses to water district board members beyond per diems. Citing Section 13 of PD 198 and *Baybay Water District v. Commission on Audit*, the Court stated that per diems were intended to be the compensation of board members.
*   **No Refund Required:** The Court MODIFIED the COA decision, ruling that petitioners were NOT required to refund the disallowed amounts. The Court found they acted in good faith, believing LWUA Board Resolutions authorized the payments. Citing *Abanilla v. Commission On Audit* and *Querubin v. Regional Cluster Director*, the Court reasoned that there were no indicia of bad faith. Further citing *De Jesus [Metro Cariaga Water District] v. COA*; *Molen [Metro Iloilo Water District] v. COA*; *Magno [Mangaldan Water District] v. COA*; *de Jesus v. CSC*, and *Cabili and de Vera v. CSC*.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **PD 198 (Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973), Section 13:**  Key statute prohibiting compensation beyond per diems for water district directors.
*   **Article IX, Section 2, Subdivision D of the 1987 Constitution:** Grants COA authority to audit government entities and disallow illegal/irregular disbursements.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 954073 (Cruz v. Cabili):** CSC ruling prohibiting additional compensation, cited by the COA.
*   ***Baybay Water District v. Commission on Audit*:** Jurisprudence interpreting Section 13 of PD 198.
*   ***Rodolfo S. de Jesus [Catbalogan Water District] v. COA*:** Upheld COA's authority to rule on disbursement of funds by water districts.
*   ***Abanilla v. Commission On Audit*:**  Discusses good faith as a basis for not requiring refunds.
*   ***Querubin v. Regional Cluster Director*:** Discusses good faith as a basis for not requiring refunds.
*   ***Peralta v. Mathay*:** Defined allowances as additional compensation or renumeration.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Good Faith" Determination:** While the petitioners were not required to refund the disallowed amounts due to "good faith," this determination is fact-specific and could be subject to different interpretations in future cases.
*   **Future Application of PD 198, Section 13:** The ruling reinforces the strict interpretation of Section 13 of PD 198. Water districts and LWUA should be cautious in approving compensation or benefits beyond the allowed per diems.

**Conclusion:**

This case clarifies the COA's broad audit authority over water districts and reinforces the prohibition on excessive compensation for board members under PD 198. While the individuals in this specific case were shielded from refund liability due to good faith, the ruling serves as a warning against unauthorized compensation schemes.
