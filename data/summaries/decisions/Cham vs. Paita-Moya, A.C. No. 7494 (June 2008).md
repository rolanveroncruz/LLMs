**Case Summary: Cham v. Paita-Moya, A.C. No. 7494 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Eva Paita-Moya for alleged deceit and failure to pay just debts (unpaid rentals and electric bills) related to a lease agreement.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Respondent leased an apartment unit from Greenville Realty and Development Corp. (GRDC), represented by Complainant Wilson Cham, from October 1, 1998, to September 30, 1999, at P8,000/month.
*   **Extension & Increased Rent:** The lease was extended on a month-to-month basis until October 2000, with the rental rate increasing to P8,650/month from October 1, 1999.
*   **Unpaid Rent & Bills:** Complainant alleges Respondent failed to pay rentals from July to October 2000 and electric bills for September and October 2000, totaling P71,007.88 as of October 15, 2004.
*   **Secret Vacating:** Complainant alleges Respondent secretly vacated the apartment without notice or returning keys.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent claims she paid rentals, vacated due to notice for repairs (which never happened), and couldn't contact complainant to return keys or request accounting of her deposit.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent:** To pay rent as per the lease agreement and any extended agreements. To settle electric bills. Duty of candor to the court.
*   **Complainant/GRDC:** Maintain the premises (potentially relevant to the defense).
*   Both Parties: abide by the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent:**  Found guilty of gross misconduct for failure to pay just debts and deceitful conduct.
*   **Potential Civil Liability:**  While the case is disciplinary, the underlying unpaid debt remains a potential civil claim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Proof of Payment:** Respondent's failure to produce receipts for rental payments is a significant risk. The burden of proving payment falls on the debtor (Respondent).
*   **Denial of Receipt of Demand Letters:** Respondent's lack of specific denial regarding receiving demand letters strengthens Complainant's case, per Rule 8, Section 11 of the Rules of Court (allegations not specifically denied are deemed admitted).
*   **Credibility of Defense:** Respondent's claim of not being able to contact complainant after a two-year landlord-tenant relationship is deemed implausible, undermining her credibility.
*   **"Just Debt" Definition:** The court defines "just debts" as claims adjudicated or admitted by the debtor. Here, the debt is considered "just" based on the lease agreement and Respondent's implied admission by not specifically denying the debt.
*   **IBP's Initial Resolution:**  The IBP's initial dismissal (later overturned by the Supreme Court) suggests a potential argument regarding the severity of the misconduct warranting disciplinary action.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 8, Section 11, Rules of Court:** Allegations not specifically denied are deemed admitted.
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Lawyers shall uphold the law and not engage in dishonest or deceitful conduct.
*   **Alonzo v. San Juan, G.R. No. 137549:** burden of proof for payment of debt.
*   **Monfort v. Aguinaldo, 91 Phil. 913:** receipts are the best evidence of payment.
*   **Orasa v. Seva, 472 Phil. 75:** definition of just debt.
*   Cites other cases relating to the lawyer's duty to society, the bar, and the court, the consequences for conduct showing lack of moral character, and the sanctions for deliberate failure to pay just debts.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court found Atty. Paita-Moya guilty of gross misconduct and suspended her from the practice of law for one month.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of upholding the law and maintaining ethical standards, even in personal financial matters.  The Respondent's failure to keep proper payment records, coupled with a weak and seemingly disingenuous defense, proved fatal.  The ruling underscores that a lawyer's personal conduct can impact their professional standing. The SCâ€™s emphasis on upholding the integrity of the profession, maintaining ethical standards and fulfilling duties to the court are reasons to enforce the suspension. Any similar failure to pay legitimate debts could expose an attorney to disciplinary action.
