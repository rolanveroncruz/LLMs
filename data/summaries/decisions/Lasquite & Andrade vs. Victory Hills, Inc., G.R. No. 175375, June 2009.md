**Case:** *Lasquite and Andrade v. Victory Hills, Inc.*, G.R. No. 175375 (2009)

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute over Lot No. 3050 in San Mateo, Rizal, with conflicting claims of ownership stemming from different original certificates of title (OCTs). The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the title of petitioners Lasquite and Andrade.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conflicting Titles:**
    *   Petitioners Lasquite and Andrade claim ownership based on OCT Nos. NP-197 and NP-198, issued in 1981 pursuant to a free patent application.
    *   Respondent Victory Hills, Inc. (VHI) claims ownership based on OCT No. 380, allegedly issued in 1937 to its predecessor-in-interest, Jose H. Manahan, by virtue of Homestead Patent No. H-19562.

*   **Validity of OCT No. 380:** The core issue revolves around the validity of VHI's OCT No. 380. The SC found OCT No. 380 to be flawed:
    *   **Improper Signature:** OCT No. 380 was signed by the "Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce," not the "Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources" as required by Section 105 of Act No. 2874 (the applicable law at the time of its issuance).
    *   **Lack of Record of Patent:** The Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) had no record of Homestead Patent No. H-19562 or a patent application for Lot No. 3050.

*   **Forgery Allegation:** VHI alleged that petitioner Lasquite forged the Deed of Quitclaim/Assignment of Rights to make it appear that Jose Manahan conveyed Lot No. 3050 to him. The SC held that VHI failed to substantiate the forgery with clear and convincing evidence.

*   **Possession and Tax Declarations:**
    *   Petitioners have been paying taxes on the land since 1972 and have utilized the land as a farm and built structures.
    *   VHI declared the lots comprising Lot No. 3050 for taxation purposes only *after* instituting the present case.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Court ordered the Register of Deeds of Rizal to cancel all titles based on the invalid OCT No. 380, recognizing the priority of OCT Nos. NP-197 and NP-198.
*   VHI bears the burden of potentially defending any conveyances made based on their flawed title.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancies in Jose Manahan's Identity:** The case highlights discrepancies regarding the identity of "Jose Manahan," as different death certificates and titles refer to different individuals with that name. This poses a risk of future litigation if the exact genealogy and rightful successors are not conclusively established.
*   **Chain of Title Defects:** The SC indicates that the TCT of subsequent transferees designated a different date of "January 4, 1937 as the original registration date of Lot No. 3050," indicating the date of OCT No. 380, however, the TC of the subsequent transferees designated the later date of "May 17, 1944," the date of sale between Jose H. Manahan and Rufino Hieras. This may be indicative of other potential defects in the chain of title derived from OCT No. 380.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 2874, Section 105:** Specifies the required signatories for land patents (Governor-General and Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources).
*   **Act No. 496, Section 47 (Land Registration Act):** Admissibility and conclusiveness of original certificates of title and certified copies.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 23:** Evidentiary value of public documents.
*   **Doctrine of Successive Registrations:**  *Manotok Realty, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corporation* (2007) â€“  Priority is given to the person claiming under the prior certificate in successive registrations.
*   **Action for Reconveyance Prescription:** *Aguirre v. Heirs of Lucas Villanueva* (2007) -  The prescriptive period for reconveyance based on implied trust is 10 years from the date of registration. However, if the plaintiff is in possession, the action is akin to a suit to quiet title and is imprescriptible.
*   **Burden of Proof for Forgery:** *Aznar Brothers Realty Company v. Court of Appeals* (2000) - The party alleging forgery bears the burden of proving it with clear and convincing evidence.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The appellate court found that the denotation of "sgd" was indicitive that the Homestead Patent No. H-19562 was signed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce. The SC found that to give probative value in court would be to allow variance or an evasion or circumvention of the requirement laid down in Section 105 of Act No. 2874.

**Advice:**

A thorough title search and verification of all underlying documents related to VHI's claim are crucial. Any further action on Lot No. 3050 should consider potential claims by heirs of deceased Jose Manahans due to the inconsistencies in the records. Consider a Quiet Title action to firmly establish the client's ownership and bar any future claims.
