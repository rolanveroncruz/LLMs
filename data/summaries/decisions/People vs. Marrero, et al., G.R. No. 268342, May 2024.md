## Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Marrero, et al.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 268342, *People of the Philippines, Plaintiff-Appellee, vs. Theodore B. Marrero, et al., Accused-Appellants.*

**Court:** Second Division, Supreme Court (Decision penned by Lazaro-Javier, J.)

**Issue:** Appeal of Sandiganbayan's conviction of the accused-appellants for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) in connection with the allegedly anomalous procurement of a Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van intended as an ambulance.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Sandiganbayan's decision and acquitted the accused-appellants.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019: Causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Alleged Irregularities:**
    *   Specification of "Mitsubishi" brand in procurement documents (violating RA 9184, Section 18).
    *   Deviation from the original purpose of procurement (initially characterized as a service vehicle, later intended as an ambulance).
    *   Revision of procurement documents to reflect the ambulance purpose *after* initial discrepancies were discovered.
    *   Alleged conspiracy among public officers and a private individual (Kimakim, the supplier).
    *   Discrepancy between the purchase price from Motorplaza, Inc. (initial seller) and the amount paid to Ronhil Trading, Inc. (Kimakim's company), suggesting overpricing.

**Key Arguments & Rationale:**

*   **Prosecution's Argument:** The accused-appellants acted with manifest partiality/evident bad faith by circumventing RA 9184 and awarding the contract to Kimakim despite irregularities, causing undue injury to the government (specifically, the PHP 87,700.91 price difference). They conspired to revise documents to conceal irregularities.
*   **Defense's Argument:**
    *   No undue injury occurred because an ambulance (with equipment) was delivered. Price discrepancies are explained by the cost of converting the van into an ambulance. Winning bid was within budget.
    *   Specifying "Mitsubishi" was not intended to give undue preference but to ensure the vehicle's suitability for Mountain Province's terrain.
    *   The original intent was always to procure an ambulance, as clarified during pre-bidding. Revisions were to correct the description of the vehicle in accordance with what was delivered.
    *   No evidence of overpricing considering the ambulance accessories and equipment.
    *   No conspiracy was proven.

**Supreme Court's Rationale for Acquittal:**

*   **Lack of Proof of Mental Element:** The prosecution failed to prove the required mental element of "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," or "gross inexcusable negligence."
*   **Brand Specification:**
    *   It was not knowingly done for corrupt or partial purpose. It arose from a lack of knowledge as to the proper term and description of the subject vehicle intended for conversion into an ambulance.
*   **Purpose of Procurement and Revision of Documents:** The core purpose was always to procure an ambulance, and the document revisions were to ensure proper accounting. Issuance of Supplemental Bid Bulletin confirms that the procurement intent was for the purchase of an ambulance.
*   **Conspiracy not Proven:**  The prosecution failed to establish each accused's specific act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
*   **Lack of Undue Injury or Unwarranted Benefit:** The government received an ambulance; the price discrepancy was explained by the conversion cost, which the prosecution failed to account for. The mere discrepancy between the purchase price from Motorplaza, Inc. and the amount ultimately paid to Ronhil Trading, Inc. does not necessarily equate to an unwarranted benefit in Kimakim's favor.
*   **NBI Statement Given Little Credence**: The court gave little weight to the sworn statement that the supplier was made to sign after the purchase.
*   *In dubio pro reo* - The prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Sec. 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the core statute violated.
*   **RA 9184, Sec. 18:** Government Procurement Reform Act, referenced regarding the prohibition against specifying brand names.
*   *Uriarte v. People*: Defines "manifest partiality," "evident bad faith," and "gross inexcusable negligence."
*    *Sabaldan Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman for Mindanao*:  Violation under Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019 based on a breach of applicable procurement laws.
*   *Macadangdang v. Sandiganbayan*: Conspiracy must be established by positive and conclusive evidence.
*   *Pare√±o v. Sandiganbayan*: Conspiracy requires evidence of actual agreement or concerted acts indicative of a common objective.
*   *People v. Januto*, *People v. Adana*, and *Renales v. People*: specification of brands does not equal evident bad faith and manifest partiality
*   *Sistoza v. Desierto*: in situations of fallible discretion, good faith is nonetheless appreciated.
*   *People v. Ramirez*: Absence of the requisite mental element is the reason why the crime is not committed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procurement Lapses:** The court acknowledged deviations from procurement rules but held they did not rise to the level of criminal culpability *in this specific case*. These lapses could still be grounds for administrative sanctions.
*   **Circumvention of Procurement Process:**  While not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the allegations of manipulating the procurement documents hint at a potential for future investigations or scrutiny.
*   **"Good Faith" Defense:**  The court relied heavily on the "good faith" defense, which can be fact-dependent and difficult to establish.
*   **Macli-ing's Conduct:** The court raised concerns about Macli-ing's conduct, suggesting potential ethical breaches or conflicts of interest. This conduct might trigger further administrative investigations.
*   **Lack of Due Process:**  This case presents a violation of due process as one defendant was not given the opportunity to present evidence in their defense.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to prove the essential elements of a violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly the *mens rea* (mental state) of manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence, and the consequential undue injury to the government or unwarranted benefit conferred. Despite acknowledging potential irregularities in the procurement process, the Court ultimately acquitted the accused-appellants.
