**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Ruiz Garcia y Ruiz*, G.R. No. 173480, February 25, 2009

**Summary:** The Supreme Court acquitted Ruiz Garcia y Ruiz of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) for illegal sale of marijuana due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. The CA and RTC convictions were reversed.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **Prosecution's Failure:** The prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt due to failure to comply with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 and chain of custody requirements.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Paragraph 1):** Mandates that the apprehending team, immediately after seizure, must physically inventory and photograph the drugs in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official; all are required to sign copies of the inventory.  The Court found that this was not done.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court emphasized the importance of establishing an unbroken chain of custody from seizure to presentation in court, tracking the movement of the seized drugs from the accused to the police, to the forensic chemist, and finally to the court. *Lopez v. People* was cited to underscore the importance of an unbroken chain of custody. The Court found crucial breaks in the chain: unclear possession between seizure and marking at the police station, unidentified police investigator who received the seized item, and unidentified personnel responsible for submitting the sample to and safeguarding it in the crime laboratory.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The Court emphasized the necessity of presenting the *corpus delicti* and proving it to be the same item seized from the accused.  Doubts were raised due to discrepancies in the markings on the evidence as testified to by PO1 Garcia versus the laboratory reports.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Facts:**

*   **Marking Discrepancies:**  The inconsistency between PO1 Garcia's testimony regarding markings ("RP-1") and the markings reflected in the request for laboratory examination and the Physical Science Report ("RGR-1", "RGR-RP1" to "RGR-RP13") was not adequately addressed.
*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception:**  The prosecution failed to invoke and prove "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21, as per the IRR of RA 9165, to trigger the saving clause regarding preservation of integrity and evidentiary value.
*   **Identification of Police Investigator:**  The identity of the police investigator to whom the seized marijuana was initially turned over was not clearly established.
*   **Personnel Involved in Subsequent Links:** The evidence did not clearly identify the individuals who transported, had custody, and performed safekeeping of the marijuana from the police inspector to the crime lab.
*  **Chain of Custody gaps** The Court raised concerns about the chain of custody between seizure and arrival at the police station.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Weak Evidence & Procedural Lapses:** The case highlights the vulnerability of convictions based on weak evidence and procedural lapses, specifically regarding chain of custody and compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   **Abuse in Buy-Bust Operations:** The Court acknowledges the potential for abuse in buy-bust operations, particularly extortion.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties does not apply when there is evidence of non-compliance with standard procedures.

**Conclusion:** The acquittal underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases, particularly concerning the chain of custody and the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165. Failure to comply can create reasonable doubt and lead to acquittal, even in cases involving buy-bust operations. The court highlighted the need for greater effort in combating the drug menace using the safeguards that our lawmakers have deemed necessary for the greater benefit of our society.
