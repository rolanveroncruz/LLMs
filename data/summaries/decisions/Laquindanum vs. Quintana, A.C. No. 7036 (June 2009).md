**Legal Document Summary: *Judge Lily Lydia A. Laquindanum vs. Atty. Nestor Q. Quintana, A.C. No. 7036, June 29, 2009***

**Nature:** Administrative case against Atty. Quintana for violations of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Unauthorized Notarial Acts:** Atty. Quintana performed notarial acts outside his authorized territorial jurisdiction (Cotabato City and Maguindanao), specifically in Midsayap, Cotabato. This violates Sec. 11, Rule III of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. This is deemed malpractice of law and falsification per *Tan Tiong Bio v. Gonzales, A.C. No. 6634, August 23, 2007, 530 SCRA 748.*
*   **Expired Commission:** Notarized documents after his notarial commission expired on December 31, 2005. This violates the lawyer's oath and amounts to deliberate falsehood, as it deceives the public. *Zoreta v. Simpliciano, A.C. 6492, November 18, 2004, 443 SCRA 1.*
*   **Improper Notarization:** Notarized a Deed of Donation where one signatory was deceased at the time of notarization. This violates Sec. 2(b), Rule IV of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, which requires personal presence and identification, and Rule 1.01 of the CPR.
*   **Unauthorized Practice of Law (Wife's Actions):** Allowed his non-lawyer wife to perform notarial acts in his absence. He cannot disclaim responsibility and thus is guilty of violating Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (aiding in unauthorized practice). *Lingan v. Calubaquib et al., Adm. Case No. 5377, June 15, 2006* establishes a notary's responsibility for their notarial register.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (upholding the integrity and dignity of the legal profession).
*   Lawyer's oath (obeying laws, avoiding falsehoods).
*   Obligations under the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   Atty. Quintana's notarial commission (if existing) is **revoked**.
*   **Disqualified** from being commissioned as a notary public for **two (2) years.**
*   **Suspended** from the practice of law for **six (6) months.**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While Atty. Quintana claimed reliance on his notarial commission as the sole source of income, the Court expressly rejected this as a mitigating factor.
*   **Entrapment Argument:** Atty. Quintana's defense of entrapment regarding his wife's actions was not accepted.
*   **IBP Membership Dispute:** The dispute with Judge Laquindanum regarding IBP membership transfer, while seemingly a source of the initial conflict, did not excuse the violations.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (specifically Sec. 11, Rule III; Sec. 2(b), Rule IV; Rule XI)
*   Code of Professional Responsibility (Canons 7 & 9; Rule 1.01)
*   *Tan Tiong Bio v. Gonzales, A.C. No. 6634, August 23, 2007, 530 SCRA 748.*
*   *Zoreta v. Simpliciano, A.C. 6492, November 18, 2004, 443 SCRA 1.*
* *Lingan v. Calubaquib et al., Adm. Case No. 5377, June 15, 2006*

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Quintana's actions constitute serious violations of notarial practice rules and professional responsibility. The sanctions imposed reflect the gravity of the offenses and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the notarial process. The case highlights the strict standards expected of notaries public and the consequences of failing to adhere to those standards.
