**Case Summary: Concorde Condominium, Inc. vs. Philippine National Bank, et al.**

**Citation:** G.R. No. 228354 & 228359, November 26, 2018 (843 Phil. 954; 115 OG No. 43, 11941 October 28, 2019)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Concorde Condominium, Inc. (CCI)
*   **Respondents:** Philippine National Bank (PNB), PNB-International Finance Limited (PNB-IFL), and New PPI Corporation (formerly Pulp and Paper, Inc. - PPI)

**Key Issue:** Validity of a real estate mortgage over an uncovered parking area within the Concorde Condominium project, and the jurisdiction of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) over the dispute.

**Background:**

PPI, the developer of Concorde Condominium, executed a Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions. PPI later subdivided the property, segregating the uncovered parking area.  PPI then mortgaged the parking area (covered by a newly issued title without the Master Deed annotation) to PNB-IFL.  CCI, representing the unit owners, claims this was done without their knowledge or consent and contrary to the Master Deed which designated the parking area as a common area.  PNB acquired the property at a foreclosure sale after PPI defaulted on the loan.

**Procedural History:**

*   CCI filed a complaint with the HLURB for annulment of title, mortgage, and reconveyance.
*   The HLURB Arbiter initially ruled in favor of CCI ordering monetary compensation from PPI, later reversed its ruling that PNB was an innocent assignee of the foreclosed property
*   HLURB Board upheld the Arbiter’s decision on appeal.
*   Office of the President (OP) affirmed the HLURB decision.
*   The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the OP, finding that HLURB lacked jurisdiction and upholding the validity of the mortgage.
*   The Supreme Court consolidated petitions from CCI and New PPI to review the CA decision.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA's decision regarding PNB-IFL and PNB and **affirmed** the dismissal of New PPI's Petition.  The Court held:

1.  **HLURB Jurisdiction:** The HLURB has jurisdiction over complaints involving unsound real estate business practices and claims by condominium unit buyers against developers. This includes actions for annulment of mortgages, foreclosure sales, and reconveyance, even if they involve title to real property. *P.D. No. 957 (Section 1), P.D. No. 1344 (Section 1), * Union Bank of the Philippines v. HLURB, et al.*, 285 Phil. 1095 (1992)

2.  **New PPI's Failure to Appeal:** New PPI's failure to appeal the HLURB-NCRFO decision to the OP constituted a waiver, and the CA correctly dismissed its petition.  PNB’s success on appeal does not inure to the benefit of New PPI because New PPI has been found liable for unsound real estate practices.

3.  **PNB-IFL Not a Mortgagee in Good Faith:** PNB-IFL (and consequently PNB) was not a mortgagee/purchaser in good faith. The bank failed to exercise the necessary due diligence in investigating the property's history and physical condition before granting the mortgage.  The bank should have been aware of the property's status as a common area based on the Master Deed and its relationship to the condominium. *Philippine National Bank v. Vila, 792 Phil. 86 (2016)*. The court gave particular weight to PNB's failure to ascertain the true status of the property before the mortgage agreement was executed.

**Key Provisions & Legal Considerations:**

*   **Republic Act No. 4726 (Condominium Act):** Governs the creation, ownership, and management of condominiums.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):**  Protects buyers against fraudulent real estate practices and grants the HLURB jurisdiction over disputes. Specifically, Section 18 prohibits mortgages without prior written approval of the Authority
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1344:** Expands the HLURB's quasi-judicial powers.
*   **Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions:**  Defines the rights and obligations of the developer and unit owners, including the designation of common areas.
*   **Mortgagee in Good Faith Doctrine:**  Protects mortgagees who rely on a clean title without notice of any defects or encumbrances.  However, banks are held to a higher standard of diligence.
*   *Union Bank of the Philippines v. HLURB, et al.*, 285 Phil. 1095 (1992): Established that mortgaging a condominium project without the unit buyer's knowledge or NHA/HLURB approval constitutes unsound real estate business practice.
*     *Philippine National Bank v. Vila, 792 Phil. 86 (2016)* PNB failed to observe the exacting standards required of banking institutions which are behooved by statutes and jurisprudence to exercise greater care and prudence before entering into a mortgage contract.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The validity of the amendment to the Master Deed without the required consent of the unit owners.
*   Whether PNB-IFL exercised sufficient due diligence to qualify as a mortgagee in good faith, given the circumstances surrounding the property and the documentation.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PPI/New PPI:** Liable for unsound real estate business practices in failing to transfer title to CCI and mortgaging the uncovered parking area without proper consent, leading to monetary damage to CCI.
*   **PNB-IFL/PNB:** Mortgage declared void. Retains a claim for the underlying debt against New PPI (but is subject to claims and defenses New PPI may have)

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Cloud on Title:** The dispute creates uncertainty regarding the title to the uncovered parking area.
*   **Financial Exposure for New PPI:**  Obligated to address the mortgage debt and potentially liable to CCI for monetary damages.
*   **Impact on Unit Owners:**  The outcome affects the rights of the unit owners concerning the use and ownership of the common areas.
