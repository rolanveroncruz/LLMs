## Legal Document Summary: *Jose T. Ong Bun vs. Bank of the Philippine Islands*

**Case:** *Jose T. Ong Bun vs. Bank of the Philippine Islands*, G.R. No. 212362, March 14, 2018.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.

**Core Issue:** Whether BPI is liable to pay petitioner for three Silver Custodian Certificates (CCs) issued by FEBTC prior to their merger, which were found in the petitioner's deceased wife's safety deposit box after maturity but not surrendered to FEBTC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CC Terms:** CCs state they are transferable only in the custodian's books upon surrender of the instrument and deed of assignment. The holder can withdraw the Silver Certificate of Deposit held in custody at any time. The instrument ceases to have force and effect upon payment.
*   **Merger:** FEBTC merged with BPI in 2000. BPI argues that all Silver Certificates of Deposit (SCDs) were paid out by 1991.
*   **Prescription:** BPI raised the defense of prescription under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, arguing that the action based on a written contract accrued upon the maturity of the CCs (in 1991) and had prescribed by the time the claim was filed in 2006.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **BPI Liability:** Initially, the RTC held BPI liable for the face value of the CCs plus interest and damages. The CA reversed, but the Supreme Court reversed the CA and affirmed the RTC's liability for the face value and interest, but removed the damages and attorney's fees.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** The Supreme Court held that the burden of proof shifts to BPI to prove payment of the obligation, once the existence of the debt is established, citing *BPI v. Sps. Royeca*, 581 Phil. 188 (2008). BPI's claim that the SCDs were no longer outstanding was deemed insufficient to prove payment.
*   **Reliance on CCs:** The Supreme Court gave significant weight to the petitioner's possession of the CCs, interpreting them as evidence of the underlying Silver Certificates of Deposit being in the custody of FEBTC (now BPI). The Court viewed the CA's interpretation of the CCs as incorrect and the finding that surrender was not required as illogical given the language of the instrument.

**Case Law:**

*   **Chessman v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 271 Phil. 89 (1991):** Distinguishes questions of law from questions of fact.
*   **Medina v. Mayor Assistor, Jr., 269 Phil. 225 (1990):** Lists the exceptions to the rule that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.
*   **BPI v. Sps. Royeca, 581 Phil. 188 (2008):** Addresses the burden of proof in establishing payment of a debt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Surrender":** The primary point of contention revolves around the interpretation of the surrender clause in the CCs. The CA argued that the surrender was not a prerequisite for payment, while the Supreme Court implied that it was and that the failure to surrender raised doubt about the validity of BPI's position.
*   **Confirmation of Participation:** BPI contended that there should have been a "Confirmation of Participation" attached to the custodian certificates. The court did not address this directly.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability despite records indicating prior payout:** BPI may face liability for deposits even if internal records suggest they were previously paid, absent compelling evidence of actual payment to the depositor.
*   **Strict Scrutiny of Bank Practices:** The case underscores the high degree of care and prudence expected of banking institutions. The court expects banks to require surrender of instruments upon payout to protect their own interests.
*   **Prescription Argument:** The court did not explicitly rule on the defense of prescription.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court ultimately found in favor of the petitioner, prioritizing the petitioner's possession of the custodian certificates. This decision suggests a strong presumption in favor of depositors when dealing with banks, especially in cases involving mergers or acquisitions. The legal document highlights the importance of clear record-keeping and the need for banks to be able to demonstrate actual payment, rather than relying solely on internal records. The SC ruling also shows deference to the contract terms of the certificates.
