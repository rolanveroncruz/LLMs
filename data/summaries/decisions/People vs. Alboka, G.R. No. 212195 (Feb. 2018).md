## Legal Document Summary: People v. Alboka, G.R. No. 212195 (2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the Court of Appeals and acquitting Accused-Appellant, Namraida Alboka, of violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. 9165:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. The Appellant was initially found guilty of selling 0.05 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Sec. 11, Art. II of R.A. 9165:** Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.  Appellant was initially found guilty of possessing two (2) sachets of shabu, each weighing 0.05 grams.
*   **Sec. 21, Art. II of R.A. 9165:**  Custody and Disposition of Confiscated/Seized Drugs. This section mandates specific procedures for handling seized drug evidence, including inventory, photography, and presence of required witnesses (accused, media, DOJ, elected public official).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Obligation to strictly comply with Sec. 21, Art. II, R.A. 9165 regarding chain of custody.  Failure to do so can result in compromised evidence and acquittal of the accused.
*   **Prosecution:** Burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing the identity of the seized drugs and unbroken chain of custody.

**Potential Risks and Issues:**

*   **Broken Chain of Custody:** The Court found a critical breakdown in the chain of custody of the seized drugs, specifically:
    *   Lack of clarity on *where* and *when* markings were placed on the seized items, and if such markings were placed in the presence of the accused.
    *   Absence of evidence demonstrating a physical inventory was conducted in the presence of the accused, media representative, DOJ representative, or an elected public official, as mandated by Sec. 21.
    *   Unexplained transfer of custody of the seized items from the apprehending officer (Lagos) to the investigator (De Lima), and then to the forensic chemist (Mangalip). Prosecution failed to explain why Lagos and Turingan brought the seized items to the SPD crime laboratory instead of De Lima.
    *   Failure to adequately show *who* brought the seized items before the trial court.
*   **Non-Compliance with Sec. 21 R.A. 9165:**  The buy-bust team's significant deviations from the prescribed procedures of Sec. 21, including lack of inventory and photo evidence, and unexplained gaps in the chain of custody, undermine the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:**  The prosecution failed to provide any justifiable grounds for the procedural lapses in handling the evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008):**  Defines and explains the "chain of custody" rule and its importance in drug cases.
*   **People v. Breis, 766 Phil. 785 (2015):** Defines the "marking" of evidence.
*   **General citation of case law on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties** - presumption can be overturned where the police officers did not accurately perform their duties.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court highlights the ambiguous points of the marking and inventory of the seized drugs.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* the accused, holding that the prosecution failed to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to the broken chain of custody and non-compliance with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165. The Court emphasized the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases to protect against tampering and ensure the integrity of evidence.
