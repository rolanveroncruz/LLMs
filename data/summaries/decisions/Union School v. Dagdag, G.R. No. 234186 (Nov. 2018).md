**Case Summary: Union School International v. Charley Jane Dagdag, G.R. No. 234186 (November 21, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which found Union School liable for illegal dismissal.

**Facts:** Charley Jane Dagdag, a probationary teacher at Union School, was dismissed after informing the school of her pregnancy out of wedlock. The school held a grievance meeting and presented her with the option to resign or be dismissed. The school cited "gross immorality" as grounds for dismissal, referencing the Faculty Handbook and Professional Code of Ethics for Teachers.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition, affirming the CA's ruling that Dagdag was illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 135 of the Labor Code:** Prohibits discrimination against women employees on account of pregnancy. SC held that Union school violated this provision.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The Court found that the school created a hostile work environment, effectively forcing Dagdag to resign. Test is whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his/her employment/position under the circumstances.
*   **Due Process:** Court affirmed the CA ruling that while a grievance meeting was held, the outcome was predetermined, thus negating its procedural value.
*   **Definition of Gross Immorality:** The Court referenced *Capin-Cadiz v. Brent Hospital and Colleges, Inc.* and *Leus v. St. Scholastica's College Westgrove*, emphasizing that "gross immorality" must be assessed based on prevailing public and secular standards, not merely religious or sectarian views. It must be detrimental to conditions upon which depend the existence and progress of human society. Pregnancy out of wedlock, without substantial evidence it's disgraceful/immoral, is not just cause for termination.

**Liabilities:**

*   Union School is liable to Dagdag for:
    *   Separation pay (1 month pay per year of service up to finality of decision)
    *   Full backwages (from illegal dismissal to finality of decision)
    *   Attorney's fees (10% of total monetary award)
    *   6% interest per annum on the monetary awards from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Gross Immorality":** The application of the "gross immorality" standard remains somewhat subjective and fact-dependent, creating potential for future litigation on similar grounds.
*   **Probationary Employment:** The fact that Dagdag was a probationary employee does not shield the school from liability for illegal dismissal based on discriminatory practices and lack of due process.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 135:** Prohibiting discrimination against women employees based on pregnancy.
*   **Capin-Cadiz v. Brent Hospital and Colleges, Inc., 781 Phil. 610 (2016):** Defining "gross immorality" based on public and secular standards.
*   **Leus v. St. Scholastica's College Westgrove, 752 Phil. 186 (2015):** Holding that pregnancy out of wedlock is not, by itself, a ground for dismissal.
*   **Mcmer Corporation, Inc., et al. v. NLRC, et al., 735 Phil. 204, 213 (2014):** Defining Constructive Dismissal.
*   **Doble, Jr. v. ABB, Inc., G.R. No. 215627, June 5, 2017, 825 SCRA 557, 579:** Test of constructive dismissal.

**Concurring Opinion (Jardeleza, J.):**
Argued that an unmarried woman has a fundamental liberty interest to engage in consensual sexual relations with an unmarried man and bear a child with him, and that terminating employment based on this violates equal protection because unmarried male employees are not held to the same standards.

**Conclusion:** The school failed to prove that Dagdag's pregnancy was "grossly immoral" under prevailing standards and violated her right to equal protection. The decision underscores the need for employers to apply consistent standards regardless of marital status and to avoid discriminatory practices.
