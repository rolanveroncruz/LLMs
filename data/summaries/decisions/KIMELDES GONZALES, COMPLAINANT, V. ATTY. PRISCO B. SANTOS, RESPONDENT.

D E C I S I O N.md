**Case Summary: *Kimeldes Gonzales v. Atty. Prisco B. Santos*, A.C. No. 10178, June 19, 2018 (833 Phil. 370)**

**Nature of the Case:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Santos for dishonesty and abuse of trust and confidence, stemming from handling a land title transfer and ejectment action.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Engagement:** Atty. Santos was engaged to register a land title in the complainant's name and file an ejectment suit. He received P60,000 for these services.
*   **Title Transfer:** Title was transferred to Complainant. However, the title was never delivered to the Complainant.
*   **Fraudulent Mortgage:** The property was fraudulently mortgaged by Atty. Santos' relative using a forged special power of attorney.
*   **Ejectment Case:** Atty. Santos did not file the ejectment case despite receiving payment.
*   **Defense:** Atty. Santos denied involvement in the mortgage and claimed he didn't agree to file the ejectment case.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   **CPR Rule 16.01:** Failure to account for money and property received from the client (the land title).
*   **CPR Rule 16.03:** Failure to deliver the client's property (the land title) upon demand.
*   **CPR Canon 17:** Violation of trust and confidence reposed in him by the client.
*   **CPR Canon 18.03** Neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Atty. Santos was found guilty and suspended from the practice of law for three years.
*   **Restitution:** Atty. Santos was ordered to return P20,000 to the complainant (unearned fees for the unfiled ejectment case).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Complicity in Fraudulent Mortgage:** Although Atty. Santos denies direct involvement, the Court found his negligence facilitated the mortgage. The proximity in time between the title issuance and mortgage, combined with his failure to deliver the title, led the court to infer his participation.
*   **Ambiguity in Receipt:** The receipt for P20,000 as partial payment did not specify its purpose, which became contentious. The Court inferred it was for the ejectment case based on the complainant's testimony and the implausibility of receiving such a large sum without a clear reason.
*   **Credibility Issues:** The Court found Atty. Santos's defense regarding his niece's actions and the complainant's alleged instruction for the mortgage lacked credibility.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **CPR (Code of Professional Responsibility):** specifically Rule 16.01, Rule 16.03, Canon 17 and Canon 18.03
*   ***Lopez v. Limos, A.C. No. 7618, February 2, 2016, 782 SCRA 609***: Cited as precedent for imposing a three-year suspension for similar violations of the CPR.
*   ***Anacta v. Resurreccion, A.C. No. 9074, August 14, 2012, 678 SCRA 352***: Cited as precedent for ordering the return of unearned fees.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of attorneys acting with the highest degree of fidelity and good faith towards their clients, as underscored by the CPR. The court's decision underscores that attorneys can be held liable, not only for direct acts of misconduct but also for negligence that facilitates fraudulent activities involving their clients' property.
