## Legal Document Summary: *Bartolo v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 172123 (2009)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a *certiorari* petition challenging the Sandiganbayan's resolution to suspend petitioners Macariola Bartolo and Violenda Sucro *pendente lite* in Criminal Case No. 27911 for falsification of public documents under Article 171(4) of the Revised Penal Code, pursuant to Section 13 of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 13 of RA 3019:** Mandates the suspension of incumbent public officers facing criminal prosecution under RA 3019, Title 7, Book II of the Revised Penal Code, or for any offense involving fraud upon government or public funds or property.

*   **Article 171(4) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes falsification of public documents by public officers, including making untruthful statements in a narration of facts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners, as public officers, were accused of falsifying documents to make it appear a flood control project was 100% complete, despite the unfinished parapet wall.
*   The prosecution alleged this falsification led to the government paying the full project amount (P1,499,111,805.63) despite the uncompleted work.
*   Section 13 of RA 3019 imposes a suspension *pendente lite* when charged with offenses covered by the Act.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The primary legal issue was whether falsification of public documents under Art. 171(4), which falls under Title Four of the RPC, qualified as "fraud upon government or public funds" under Section 13 of RA 3019. Petitioners argued it did not.
*   The Supreme Court adopted a broad interpretation of "fraud" in Section 13, citing *Bustillo v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 146217), encompassing any "trickery or deceit especially when involving misrepresentation."
*   The Court rejected the argument that statements were "figures and numbers" not a "narration of facts" noting that words were present also.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 13:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, suspension *pendente lite*.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 171(4):** Falsification of public documents by public officers.
*   ***Bustillo v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 146217:** Established a broad interpretation of "fraud" under Section 13 of RA 3019, including offenses beyond Title 7, Book II of the RPC.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   The central contention revolved around the definition of "fraud" in the context of Section 13 of RA 3019 and whether Art. 171(4) was in scope.
*   Petitioners' argument that a "change order" removed the project component was denied consideration since it would require the Supreme Court to pass upon the merits of a case that was pending before a lower court.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's suspension *pendente lite* of the petitioners, solidifying the interpretation of "fraud" under Section 13 of RA 3019 to include falsification of public documents that leads to financial loss for the government. The decision emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting and accountability for public officials.
