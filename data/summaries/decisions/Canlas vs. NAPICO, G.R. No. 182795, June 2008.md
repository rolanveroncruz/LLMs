## Legal Document Summary: *Canlas v. NAPICO Homeowners Ass'n.* (G.R. No. 182795)

**Type:** Supreme Court Resolution (Dismissal of Petition for Writ of Amparo)

**Key Issue:** Propriety of issuing a Writ of Amparo to prevent the demolition of dwellings pursuant to a final and executory court judgment.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court dismissed a Petition for Writ of Amparo filed by petitioners who were seeking to prevent the demolition of their dwellings in Barangay Manggahan, Pasig City. The petitioners claimed that their rights to shelter, life, liberty and security were violated and that the titles held by the private respondents were fraudulently obtained. The Supreme Court found that the Writ of Amparo was not the proper remedy, since the threatened demolition was based on final judgements from G.R. Nos. 177448, 180768, 177701 and 177038, which the court was not prepared to overturn by means of a writ of amparo.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 1, Rule on the Writ of Amparo:** This section defines the scope of the Writ of Amparo, limiting it to violations or threats to life, liberty, and security arising from unlawful acts or omissions of public officials or private individuals, specifically covering extralegal killings and enforced disappearances.
*   **Sec. 6, Rule on the Writ of Amparo:** This section mandates the court to issue the writ upon filing of the petition only if, on its face, the court ought to issue said writ.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioners' Risk:** The Petitioners are at risk of facing the enforcement of the final and executory judgments, which the court of law has found itself unwilling to stop by means of a writ of amparo.
*   **Misuse of Writ:** The Court emphasized its intention to protect the highest possible rights but cautioned against wasting time and effort on matters outside the writ's scope.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule on the Writ of Amparo, Sec. 1 and Sec. 6:** The court relied directly on these sections to determine the scope and applicability of the Writ of Amparo.
*   **G.R. Nos. 177448, 180768, 177701, 177038:** Pre-existing final judgments, the reversal of which would be needed to grant the requested writ of amparo.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The petition attempts to circumvent the rules against multiple motions for reconsideration by framing the Amparo petition as independent, but related to prior dismissed cases.

**Legal Analysis and Potential Risks:**

The Court clearly interpreted the scope of the Writ of Amparo narrowly, focusing on the text in Sec. 1 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo. Petitioners' attempt to use the Writ to challenge the validity of land titles and prevent a demolition order based on final judgements was unsuccessful. Their claim to the right to shelter was deemed insufficient to trigger the protections afforded by the Writ of Amparo.
