Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the consolidated petitions, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Name:** *Agencia Exquisite of Bohol, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* (consolidated with related cases)
**Citation:** 598 Phil. 359 (2009)
**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines
**Date:** February 12, 2009
**Ponente:** Azcuna, J.

**Summary:**

This case involves consolidated petitions contesting the imposition of a 5% lending investor's tax on pawnshops by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR). The CIR based the assessments on Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 15-91 and Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 43-91, classifying pawnshops as lending investors subject to the percentage tax under then Section 116 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1977, as amended.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **CIR's Position:** RMO 15-91 and RMC 43-91 validly classify pawnshops as lending investors, making them subject to the 5% lending investor's tax.
*   **Taxpayer's Position (Agencia Exquisite & Exquisite Pawnshop):**
    *   No specific provision in the Tax Code subjects pawnshops to this tax.
    *   Pawnshop business is distinct from lending investor business.
    *   RMO 15-91 and RMC 43-91 violate due process and equal protection clauses, and encroach on legislative prerogative.
    *   Stare decisis applies based on *CIR v. Lhuillier*, which held pawnshops not to be lending investors for percentage tax purposes.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the pawnshops. The Court held that pawnshops are not lending investors for the purpose of imposing the 5% percentage tax under Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, applying stare decisis based on *CIR v. Lhuillier* (453 Phil. 1043 (2003)) and *CIR v. Trustworthy Pawnshop, Inc.* (G.R. No. 149834, May 2, 2006).  The Court invalidated RMO No. 15-91 and RMC No. 43-91.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Legislative Intent:** Congress never intended for pawnshops to be treated the same as lending investors, as evidenced by different tax treatments under the NIRC.
*   **Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius:** Section 116 only mentions dealers in securities and lending investors, excluding pawnshops by implication.
*   **Prior BIR Rulings:**  The BIR previously ruled that pawnshops were not subject to the 5% percentage tax.
*   **Repeal of Section 116:** Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977, the basis for the RMO and RMC, was repealed by R.A. No. 7716.
*   **Lack of Publication:** RMO 15-91 and RMC 43-91 were not published, violating due process.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Section 116 of the NIRC of 1977 (as amended by Executive Order No. 273)
*   R.A. No. 7716
*   Sections 161 and 192 of the NIRC of 1986
*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc.*, 453 Phil. 1043 (2003)
*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Trustworthy Pawnshop, Inc.*, G.R. No. 149834, May 2, 2006

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The primary risk lies in the CIR attempting to re-litigate the issue, despite the clear precedent.
*   The case turns heavily on the interpretation of legislative intent and the application of the *expressio unius* maxim, which could be subject to different interpretations in future cases if the legislative framework changes.
*   **Retroactive application** - The application of the ruling to assessments prior to Lhuillier or Trustworthy may need to be examined.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court granted the petitions of Agencia Exquisite of Bohol, Inc. and Exquisite Pawnshop and Jewelry, Inc. The Decisions and Resolutions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP Nos. 59282 and 59401 were reversed and set aside, and the Decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case Nos. 5774 and 5741 were reinstated. The petition of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in G.R. No. 157359 was denied and the Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 64117 was affirmed.
