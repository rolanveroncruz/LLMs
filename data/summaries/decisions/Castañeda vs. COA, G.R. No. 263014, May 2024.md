## Legal Document Summary: *Engr. Numeriano M. Castañeda, Jr. vs. Commission on Audit* (G.R. No. 263014, May 14, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 in relation to Rule 64 assailing COA Decision and Resolution affirming Notices of Disallowance (NDs) for unauthorized payments.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **ND 12-001-101(11):** Disallowance of additional allowances (rice, grocery, medical) and year-end financial assistance to employees hired after December 31, 1999.
*   **ND 12-002-101(11):** Disallowance of year-end financial assistance and cash gift to San Rafael Water District (SRWD) Board of Directors (BOD).
*   **Core Issue:** Whether COA gravely abused its discretion in upholding the NDs and holding petitioners liable for the disallowed amounts.

**COA's Position:**

*   Additional allowances were integrated into standardized salary rates under RA 6758, Section 12 and DBM Corporate Compensation Circular (CCC) No. 10-99.
*   Year-end financial assistance to BOD lacked presidential approval per EO 24, Section 8(d) and DBM Budget Circular No. 005-6.
*   Good faith cannot excuse approving/certifying officers due to gross negligence.
*   Recipient-payees are liable under *solutio indebiti*.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   Reliance on DBM Letter (Garcia Letter) authorizing the allowances for employees hired after December 31, 1999.
*   Good faith reliance on Local Water Utility Administration (LWUA) Board Resolution (BR) No. 239 and LWUA Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 004.11 for BOD benefits.
*   COA erred in retroactively applying *Chozas v. COA* to hold employees liable.

**Court's Ruling:** Petition dismissed. COA's Decision and Resolution affirmed with modification.

**Key Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6758 (Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989), Section 12:** Standardized salary rates include all allowances except specified ones.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 198 (Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973), as amended by RA 9286, Section 13:** Governs compensation of LWD directors, allowing for allowances and benefits subject to LWUA approval.
*   **Executive Order No. 24, Section 8(d):** Salaries, allowances, benefits, and bonuses to BOD members must be authorized by law or charter and approved by the President.
*   **DBM Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10-99:** Implements RA 6758.
*   **DBM Budget Circular No. 005-6:** Requires presidential approval for year-end bonuses.
*   **Administrative Order (AO) No. 103 (2004):** Suspends the grant of new and additional benefits and limits existing allowances.
*   ***Baybay Water District v. COA*** **(425 Phil. 326 (2002)):** RA 6758 does not apply to directors of local water districts.
*   ***Chozas v. Commission on Audit*** **(864 Phil. 733 (2019)):** Recipients of illegally disbursed allowances must return them under *solutio indebiti*.
*   ***Madera v. Commission on Audit*** **(882 Phil. 744 (2020)):** Establishes the rules on return of disallowed amounts, focusing on good faith, regular performance, and diligence.
*   ***Abrigo v. Commission on Audit-Commission Proper*** **(G.R. No. 253117, March 29, 2022):** Obligations of approving and certifying officers to know relevant rules, regulations, and jurisprudence.
*   ***Paguio v. Commission on Audit*** **(G.R. No. 223547, April 27, 2021):** LWUA Resolution No. 239 cannot be considered a legitimate approval of LWDs' grant of year-end financial assistance and cash gift to the members of their BOD.
*    ***Abellanosa v. Commission on Audit*** **(890 Phil. 413 (2020)):** civil liability of such payee-recipient - in contrast to an approving/authorizing officer - has no direct substantive relation to the performance of one's official duties or functions, particularly in terms of approving/authorizing the unlawful expenditure. As such, the payee-recipient is treated as a debtor of the government whose civil liability is based on solutio indebiti, which is a distinct source of obligation. When the civil obligation is sourced from solutio indebiti, good faith is inconsequential.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Engr. Numeriano Castañeda, Jr. (General Manager) & Ms. Marivel Suarez (Division Manager):** Solidarily liable for the total disallowed amount, after deducting amounts refunded by the employee-recipients due to their gross negligence in approving and certifying the disbursements.
*   **Employee-Recipients & BOD Members:** Liable to the extent of the amounts they received, based on the principle of *solutio indebiti* regardless of good faith, through salary deduction or other modes determined by COA.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Garcia Letter:** Court deemed it erroneous and insufficient basis for the allowances.  Its validity and application were key points of contention.
*   **Good Faith Defense:**  The court found that the approving and certifying officers were grossly negligent, negating the presumption of good faith.
*   **Retroactive Application of *Chozas*:** The Court upheld its application, leading to liability for recipient-payees despite potential claims of good faith.
*   **Determination of Gross Negligence:** This finding is fact-specific and hinges on the officers' awareness of and adherence to applicable laws, regulations, and jurisprudence at the time of the disbursements.
*   **Applicability of *Solutio Indebiti* and Unjust Enrichment:*** This is a crucial principle as it forms the basis of liability of recipient-payees, absent any evidence showing that the allowances and bonuses given were in consideration of the actual services rendered or work accomplished by the employee-recipients.
