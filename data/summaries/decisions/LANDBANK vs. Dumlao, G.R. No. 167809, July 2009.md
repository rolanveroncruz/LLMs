## Legal Document Summary: Landbank v. Dumlao, G.R. No. 167809

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Resolution (Motion for Reconsideration Denial)

**Case Summary:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) seeks reconsideration of a previous Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision regarding just compensation for land acquired under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 27 (Emancipation of Tenants). The Supreme Court *denies* the Motion for Reconsideration and remands the case to the trial court for final determination of just compensation.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **LBP's Argument:** LBP argues that the formula prescribed in PD No. 27 and Executive Order (EO) No. 228, as applied in *Gabatin v. Land Bank*, should be used to calculate just compensation.
*   **Court's Rejection:** The Court rejects LBP's reliance on *Gabatin*, distinguishing it because the applicability of the PD 27/EO 228 formula was not contested in *Gabatin*, unlike in the present case. The Court reiterates that determination of just compensation is a *judicial prerogative*, citing *Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay*.
*   **Application of RA 6657:** LBP claims the Court retroactively applied Republic Act (RA) No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law - CARL). The Court clarifies its position, stating that Section 17 of RA 6657 applies *only if* just compensation for lands acquired under PD No. 27 remained unresolved *prior* to RA 6657's enactment. In such cases, the Section 17 factors are considered.
*   **Remand:** The Court remands the case to the trial court, emphasizing the long-overdue determination of just compensation owed to the respondents.

**Obligations:**

*   **Trial Court:** Obligated to determine the just compensation due to the respondents, considering the factors outlined in Section 17 of RA 6657, if applicable (i.e., if compensation was unresolved prior to RA 6657).
*   **Land Bank:** Obligated to pay the just compensation as determined by the trial court.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability for Just Compensation:** LBP remains liable to pay just compensation to the respondents. The amount will be determined by the trial court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute Regarding "Unresolved" Compensation:** The primary risk lies in establishing whether the compensation for the land *had* been determined or resolved *before* the enactment of RA 6657. If it was unresolved, Section 17 of RA 6657 applies, potentially leading to a higher compensation amount based on factors like current value and income. The ambiguity lies in what constitutes "settled" or "unresolved" prior to RA 6657. The burden of proof likely rests on Dumlao to show compensation was not settled.
*   **Valuation Factors Under RA 6657:** Litigation risk exists in arguing the weight and application of the Section 17 valuation factors.  These factors are broad (cost of acquisition, current value, nature, actual use, etc.) and open to interpretation and evidentiary support, potentially leading to drawn-out valuation disputes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
