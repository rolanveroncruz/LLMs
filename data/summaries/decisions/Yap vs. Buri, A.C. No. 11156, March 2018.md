**Summary of _Michelle Yap v. Atty. Grace C. Buri_, A.C. No. 11156, March 19, 2018**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against a lawyer.

**Facts:**
*   Atty. Buri (Respondent) purchased a condominium unit from Michelle Yap (Complainant).
*   Dispute arose over the unpaid balance of P200,000.00 on the P1,200,000.00 purchase price.
*   Respondent threatened the Complainant and filed a dismissed Estafa case against her, alleging misrepresentation regarding spousal consent to the sale.
*   Respondent failed to respond to the administrative complaint, attend hearings, or submit a position paper.

**Holding:** Respondent found guilty of violating the Code of Professional Responsibility and suspended from the practice of law for one year.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01 (CPR):**  Prohibits unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct. Respondent's failure to pay her debt, threats, and filing of a false Estafa case violated this Canon.
*   **Canon 7, Rule 7.03 (CPR):** Prohibits conduct that adversely reflects on fitness to practice law or discredits the legal profession. Respondent's actions reflected poorly on the integrity of the legal profession.
*   Violation of Lawyer's Oath: Respondent failed to uphold the Constitution, obey laws, and avoid promoting groundless suits.
*   Failure to pay a just debt constitutes gross misconduct.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   Suspension from the practice of law for one year.
*   Duty to uphold a high standard of morality, honesty, integrity, and fair dealing.
*   Obligation to exhibit good faith, fairness, and candor in all dealings, professional or private.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Canons 1 & 7, Rules 1.01 & 7.03 specifically cited.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**
*   The decision highlights the risk of disciplinary action for lawyers engaging in unethical conduct even in private transactions, emphasizing the high standards expected.
*   The deletion of the order to pay P200,000.00 indicates a separation between disciplinary proceedings and civil liabilities, requiring the Complainant to pursue a separate civil action for debt collection.
*   Ambiguity: While the court emphasized the importance of paying debts and avoiding litigation, it remains unclear when personal debt will be classified as a violation of professional ethics.
