**Liabilities:**

*   Liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Reporting:** While the Court addressed the issue of delay by the victim in reporting the incidents, this is often a contentious point in rape cases. The Court considered the explanation of fear due to threats as reasonable.
*   **Sufficiency of Resistance:** The defense argued insufficient resistance. The Court dismissed this, citing *People v. Rodriguez, 425 Phil. 848 (2002)* and noting the father's parental authority substituted for violence/intimidation.
*   **Defense of Denial/Alibi:** The Court rightly dismissed the accused's defense of denial and unsubstantiated alibi.

**Conclusion:**

The Court upheld the conviction based on the victim's credible testimony, corroborating DNA evidence, and the accused's weak defense. The Court properly applied established legal principles regarding the elements of rape, the relevance of DNA evidence, and the assessment of witness credibility. The main issues were the delay in reporting and the resistance offered, both which the court addressed citing precedence.
