## Legal Document Summary: *Romeo Asis, Oscar Asis and Eduardo Asis vs. Consuelo Asis Vda. De Guevarra* (G.R. No. 167554, February 26, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reinstating a Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) decision in an unlawful detainer action.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Unlawful Detainer Action:** Respondent (Consuelo Asis Vda. De Guevarra) filed separate ejectment cases against petitioners (her brothers) based on unpaid rentals for apartment units located on land co-owned by all siblings.
*   **Respondent's Claim:** Respondent asserts sole ownership of the *apartment units*, despite co-ownership of the land, claiming she paid for the construction. She alleges a landlord-tenant relationship with the petitioners.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:** Petitioners claim co-ownership of both land and apartment units through inheritance (accession) from their parents, denying any rental agreement. They allege previous payments were contributions for upkeep, not rent.
*   **MeTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of respondent, finding a valid basis for ejectment based on rent arrears and insufficient evidence to support petitioners' claim of co-ownership of the apartment units.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Reversed the MeTC, citing lack of jurisdiction because the case involved rights to the building, not just possession of the land, referencing *Chua Peng Hian v. CA* (133 SCRA 572).
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, reinstating the MeTC decision. Held that *Chua Peng Hian* was inapplicable. The CA affirmed MeTC's jurisdiction to resolve ownership issues *solely to determine possession* under Rule 70, Section 16 of the Rules of Civil Procedure and BP 129.

**Liabilities & Remedies Ordered by MeTC:**

*   Petitioners ordered to vacate the apartment units.
*   Petitioners ordered to pay rental arrearages and monthly compensation until they vacate.
*   Petitioners ordered to pay attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 16 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Allows MeTC to resolve ownership issues to determine possession in ejectment cases.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (BP 129):** Expanded inferior courts' jurisdiction in ejectment proceedings to include the power to resolve ownership issues solely for determining possession.
*   ***Chua Peng Hian v. CA* (133 SCRA 572):** Distinguished; CA found it inapplicable as it pertained to specific performance, not unlawful detainer.
*   ***Sps. Refugia v. CA* (327 Phil. 982 (1996)):** Elaborates on jurisdiction over ownership issues in ejectment cases, emphasizing the importance of possession being the primary issue and ownership merely ancillary.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Provisional Nature of Ownership Determination:** The MeTC's ruling on ownership is *provisional only* and does not bar a separate action to determine the actual title.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** The MeTC found petitioners' evidence of co-ownership lacking. This highlights the importance of presenting strong evidence of ownership or contributions towards the construction of the apartment units.
*   **Land Co-ownership vs. Building Ownership:** The central legal issue revolves around the separate ownership of the apartment units built on co-owned land. The petitioners must provide evidence to prove the legal principle of accession, and the loan secured in 1964 by their parents in which they claim the structures were a part thereof.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, which affirmed the MeTC's jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer action. The key holding is that even if ownership is an issue in an ejectment case, the MeTC retains jurisdiction to resolve it *solely* for determining the right to possession.  The petitioners face the immediate risk of eviction and payment of arrearages. Their ultimate recourse is to pursue a separate action to conclusively establish their ownership of the apartment units in a court of proper jurisdiction.
