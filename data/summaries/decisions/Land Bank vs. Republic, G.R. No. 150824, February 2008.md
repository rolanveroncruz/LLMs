**Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 150824, February 4, 2008**

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines affirming the Court of Appeals decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC decision declaring Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. P-2823 and all derivative Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) null and void.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Invalidity of Original Title:** OCT No. P-2823 was issued for land still classified as forest land (Project No. 1, LC-47 dated August 6, 1923) at the time of issuance (September 26, 1969). It was only released as alienable and disposable on March 25, 1981, pursuant to BFD Administrative Order No. 4-1585 and to the provisions of Section 13, Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 705

*   **Regalian Doctrine:** Forest lands are outside the commerce of man and unsusceptible of private appropriation in any form.

*   **Derivative Titles Also Void:** Because the mother title (OCT No. P-2823) is void, all titles derived from it, including TCT No. T-57348 in the name of Lourdes Farms, Inc. (the mortgagor), are also void, referencing *Republic v. Reyes*, G.R. Nos. L-30263-5, October 30, 1987, 155 SCRA 313.

*   **No Mortgage Rights:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) as mortgagee acquired no valid and subsisting mortgagee's interest over the land covered by the TCT No. T-57348.

*   **No Protection for Mortgagee:** As reiterated in *Republic v. Reyes*, mortgagees of non-disposable lands where titles thereto were erroneously issued acquire no protection under the Land Registration Law.

*   **Prescription and Estoppel Do Not Apply:** The State is not barred by prescription or estoppel from recovering public forest land fraudulently included in patents or certificates of title, referencing *Reyes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 94524, September 10, 1998, 295 SCRA 296 and *Republic v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 79582, April 10, 1989, 171 SCRA 721, 734.

*   **Non-Impairment Clause Not Applicable:** The constitutional guarantee of non-impairment of contracts cannot validate LBP's interest as mortgagee where the underlying title is void, as that restraint is a valid exercise of the police power of the State. The constitutional guarantee of non-impairment of contracts may not likewise be used by LBP to validate its interest over the land as mortgagee.

*   **Cross-Claim Remanded:** LBP's cross-claim against Lourdes Farms, Inc. for the outstanding obligation or substitute collateral was remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **LBP:** Bears the risk of loss of the security (TCT No. T-57348) for its loan to Lourdes Farms, Inc.
*   **Lourdes Farms, Inc.:** Remains obligated to LBP for the loan, subject to further proceedings on the cross-claim at the RTC.
*   **Davao City Register of Deeds:** Shall cancel the Transfer Certificate of Titles mentioned in paragraph number one.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Loss for LBP:** LBP faces significant financial loss due to the invalidity of the mortgage.
*   **Protracted Litigation:** The remand of the cross-claim ensures further litigation and expenses.
*   **Reputational Risk:** LBP may suffer reputational damage for accepting forest land as collateral and the public scrutiny that is a consequence of the mortgage not being enforced.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The legal remedies that LBP will be able to pursue against Lourdes Farms, Inc. remain unclear.

No. L-74957, June 30, 1987, 151 SCRA 679.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the reversion of the land to the public domain, leaving LBP with a worthless mortgage. The remand of the cross-claim provides LBP with an avenue to attempt to recover some losses, however, any future proceeds from the loan obligation of Lourdes Farms, Inc. will depend on the RTC determination.
