**Legal Document Summary: *PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. v. UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc.***

**Case:** G.R. No. 162267, July 4, 2008 (579 Phil. 418)

**Subject Matter:** Liability of a registered owner of a vehicle under a lease agreement for damages arising from a quasi-delict (vehicular accident).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. (Registered owner of the truck)
*   **Respondent:** UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc. (Subrogee of the vehicle owner damaged in the accident, United Coconut Planters Bank)
*   **Other Relevant Parties:** Renato Gonzaga (Driver of the truck), Superior Gas Equitable Co., Inc. (SUGECO, Lessee of the truck)

**Key Facts:**

*   A truck owned by PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. (Petitioner) and driven by Renato Gonzaga (employee of SUGECO, lessee of the truck) caused damage to a car owned by United Coconut Planters Bank, which was insured by UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc. (Respondent).
*   UCPB General Insurance Co., Inc. paid UCPB for the damage and sought reimbursement from PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc.
*   PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc. claimed it was not liable because SUGECO was the actual operator of the truck and Gonzaga was SUGECO's employee based on the Lease Agreement.
*   The lease was not registered with the Land Transportation Office (LTO).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court held PCI Leasing and Finance, Inc., as the registered owner of the truck, solidarily liable with the negligent driver, Renato Gonzaga, for the damages caused to UCPB.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Registration of Motor Vehicles (R.A. 4136):** The Court emphasizes the importance of compulsory motor vehicle registration under the Land Transportation and Traffic Code (R.A. No. 4136). Failure to register the lease agreement means the lease does not bind third parties (like UCPB). R.A 4136, Section 5 states the need for registration for the validity of encumbrances against third parties
*   **Quasi-Delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code):** The Court applies the principle of quasi-delict, holding that the registered owner is primarily liable for damages arising from the negligent operation of the vehicle, regardless of who the actual operator or employer is.
*   **Registered Owner as Employer:** The Court treats the registered owner (PCI Leasing) as the employer of the driver (Gonzaga) for purposes of liability to the public. SUGECO (lessee) is considered merely the owner's agent.
*   **Lease Encumbrance:** The Court declared that the unregistered lease is an encumbrance in the eyes of the law and is invalid against third parties.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The registered owner is solidarily liable with the negligent driver if the aggrieved party is seeking relief under a quasi-delict.

**Liabilities:**

*   PCI Leasing and Renato Gonzaga are jointly and severally liable to UCPB for P244,500.00, with 6% interest per annum from the filing of the complaint until finality of the judgment, and 12% interest per annum thereafter until fully satisfied.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Unregistered Leases/Transfers:**  The primary risk lies in failing to register leases or transfers of ownership with the LTO. This exposes the registered owner to potential liability for the actions of the lessee/transferee.
*   **Third-Party Claims:**  The registered owner may face third-party claims even if they are not directly involved in the operation of the vehicle.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Erezo v. Jepte (102 Phil. 103):**  The foundational case establishing the liability of the registered owner of a vehicle for damages arising from its operation. This is the controlling case.
*   **Equitable Leasing Corp. v. Suyom (437 Phil. 244):** Confirms Erezo doctrine.
*   **First Malayan Leasing and Finance Corp. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 91378):** Confirms Erezo doctrine.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 2176:**  Quasi-delict
*   **Republic Act No. 4136:** Land Transportation and Traffic Code (Compulsory Motor Vehicle Registration)
*   **Republic Act No. 8556, Sec. 12:** The Court ruled that this law does not apply in this case because it does not supersede or repeal Section 5(a) and (e) of R.A. No. 4136.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Lease Agreement was the key contentious issue.  The fact that it existed but was unregistered was the basis for the Court's decision against PCI Leasing. PCI leasing may have recourse through a 3rd party complaint.

**Conclusion:**

This case confirms the well-established principle that the registered owner of a motor vehicle is primarily liable for damages caused by its operation, regardless of who the actual operator is, especially when transfers or leases are unregistered. Republic Act No. 8556 does not supersede the laws on compulsory motor vehicle registration.  Financing companies must ensure that leases are properly registered to protect themselves from liability. However, PCI Leasing may have a recourse against SUGECO via a third-party complaint, based on the indemnity provision in the lease contract.
