## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-03-1762

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Jose S. Majaducon, Sheriff Lastimosa, and Sheriff Palati arising from the implementation of a demolition order.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Demolition Order:** Judge Majaducon issued a demolition order in consolidated Civil Cases Nos. 1291 & 4647, involving a land dispute between Spouses Yu and the Heirs of John Sycip/Yard Urban Homeowners Association.
*   **Notice to Vacate:** Sheriff Palati (noted by Lastimosa) issued a Notice to Vacate to the aforementioned parties *and* "all adverse claimants and actual occupants" including the Andres spouses.
*   **Civil Case No. 7066:** Andres spouses (Complainants) filed a separate case (7066) for Specific Performance, Reconveyance and Damages, impleading the aforementioned heirs, the judge and sheriffs due to the demolition order, and questioning the validity of the initial order of demolition.
*   **Dismissal and Contempt:** Judge Majaducon dismissed Civil Case No. 7066 outright without raffle and declared the Andreses in direct contempt of court.

**Obligations:**

*   **Judge Majaducon:** Obligated to follow Supreme Court Circular No. 7 regarding the raffling of cases. He was also obligated under the New Code of Judicial Conduct to remain impartial.
*   **Sheriffs Lastimosa and Palati:** Obligated to execute the demolition order in accordance with its mandate (limited to parties in the consolidated cases).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Majaducon:** Found guilty of abuse of authority for improperly dismissing Civil Case No. 7066 without raffle, citing the Andreses in contempt, and acting on a case where he previously represented the opposing party.  Sanctioned with a fine of P20,000 deducted from retirement benefits. Cited case law: *Ang Kek Chen v. Bello*, *Hilario v. Ocampo III*, *Abad v. Somera*.
*   **Sheriffs Lastimosa and Palati:** Complaint against them was dismissed due to evidence suggesting they executed the order carefully and according to procedure.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **"All Adverse Claimants" Language:** The Notice to Vacate extended to "all adverse claimants" could be interpreted as overbroadening the scope of the demolition order, though the court ultimately ruled against this argument given the complainants' privity to the losing party.
*   **Judge's Former Representation:** The demand letter signed by Judge Majaducon on behalf of Cesar Ba√±as, Melencio Yu and Dominga Pinagawang created the appearance of partiality and violated Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct which states "judges shall disqualify themselves from participating in any proceedings in which they are unable to decide the matter impartially or in which it may appear to a reasonable observer that they are unable to decide the matter impartially. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, instances where (b) the judge previously served as lawyer in the matter in controversy."

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 7:** Governs the raffling of cases.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Defines the sanctions for misconduct of judges.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3:** Concerns impartiality and disqualification of judges.
*   *Ang Kek Chen v. Bello* and *Hilario v. Ocampo III*:  Emphasize the importance of proper raffling of cases.
*    *Vda. De Medina v. Cruz*: A judgement pertaining to ownership and/or possession of real property is binding upon the defendants and all persons claiming right of possession or ownership from the said defendant and the prevailing party need not file a separate action for ejectment to evict the said privies from the premises.

**Overall:**

The document highlights the importance of judicial impartiality and adherence to procedural rules, specifically regarding the raffling of cases. It also addresses the delicate balance between enforcing court orders and protecting the rights of individuals who may not have been directly party to the original litigation. The case provides guidance on when a judge should recuse themselves due to past legal representation of a party.
