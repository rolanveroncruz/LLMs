**Case Summary: Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Commissioner of Customs, G.R. No. 104781, July 10, 1998**

**Subject:** Ad Valorem Duties on Imported Crude Oil

**Key Issue:** Whether "Basic Sediment and Water" (BSW) content in imported crude oil should be deducted from the gross actual receipts when calculating ad valorem duties.

**Background:** Caltex protested ad valorem duty assessments on crude oil imports based on a Customs memorandum (Geotina memo) that duties should be based on gross actual receipts without deducting BSW.  Caltex argued BSW should be deducted.

**Legal Analysis & Rulings:**

*   **Publication of Customs Memorandum:** The Court acknowledges that the Geotina memorandum, increasing duties, was of general applicability and should have been published per Commonwealth Act No. 638 and due process requirements established in *Tañada v. Tuvera, 146 SCRA 446 (1986)*. Failure to publish renders it unenforceable. However, the court invokes the "operative fact" doctrine from *Fernandez v. Cuerva, 21 SCRA 1095 (1967)*, recognizing collections under the memo were made in good faith.

*   **Estoppel/Laches:** Caltex's 11-year delay (1971 Memo - 1982 Import) in challenging the memorandum's validity is deemed unreasonable. The Court applies the principle of laches, barring relief because of Caltex's failure to be vigilant in protecting its rights and citing *Catholic Bishop of Balanga v. Court of Appeals, 264 SCRA 181 (1996)*.

*   **Dutiable Value (Home Consumption Value):**  Referencing *Commissioner of Customs v. Court of Tax Appeal, 161 SCRA 376 (1988)* and Sec. 201 of the Tariff and Customs Code, dutiable value is based on home consumption value (price in sales invoice). Caltex's sales invoices were not conclusive since the import permit did not exclude BSW contents. Caltex's import permit declaration, being a sworn statement, is given greater weight in assessing the dutiable value.

*   **BSW as Impurities:** The Court concludes BSW *are* impurities naturally occurring in crude oil, based on industry authority references. This is not an unusual quantity and, as such, not deductible citing *York Feather and Down Corp. v. U.S., 26 CCR 231 (1952)* which disallowed deduction of "dirt" or "impurities" other than those not usually found in or upon the goods

*   **Service of Petition:**  The Commissioner's failure to serve the petition for review on Caltex within the 15-day period was excused as substantial compliance, relying on *Gabionza v. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 192 (1994)*.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision reinstating the Commissioner of Customs' assessment.  Caltex's petition was dismissed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Operative Fact Doctrine:**  The application of the "operative fact" doctrine despite the memorandum's invalidity is a potential area of contention.  A future challenge could argue that the circumstances do not warrant its application or that Caltex did not benefit from the lack of publication.
*   **Valuation Discrepancy:** Caltex should address a future challenge to the import valuation practices due to the discrepancy between the sales invoice and the import entry permit. It will need to demonstrate that BSW content are not a part of the home consumption value if it hopes to change import practices.
*   **BSW Composition:** In future, a refined argument demonstrating the BSW composition and lack of commercial value at point of import may prove successful to the challenge.
*   **Circular No. 28-91** may not be used in further actions because of changes in requirements by the courts.

*   Tariff and Customs Code, Sec. 201, 1301 and 3502.
