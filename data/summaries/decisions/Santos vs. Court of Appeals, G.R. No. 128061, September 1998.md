## Legal Document Summary: *Jesus G. Santos v. Court of Appeals and Omar H. Yapchiongco* (G.R. No. 128061, September 03, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) resolutions denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration based on untimeliness.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion in holding that service of its decision via registered mail was complete despite the lack of conclusive proof of actual receipt of the notice by petitioner's counsel.

**Holding:** Yes. The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, SET ASIDE the CA resolutions, and directed the CA to act on petitioner's motion for reconsideration on the merits.

**Key Provisions/Legal Principles:**

*   **Rule 13, Section 8 of the Rules of Court (Completeness of Service):**
    *   **Registered Mail:** Service is complete upon **actual receipt** by the addressee.
    *   **Constructive Service Exception:** If the addressee fails to claim mail within five (5) days from the first postmaster's notice, service is deemed complete after that period.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** While there's a presumption that public officials perform their duties regularly, it's not absolute.  In cases of registered mail service, a mere certification that notices were "issued" is insufficient to prove actual receipt.
*   **Necessity of Conclusive Proof of Notice:**  For constructive service to be valid, there must be conclusive proof that the addressee (or someone acting on their behalf) received the notice from the post office.
*   **Insufficient Postmaster Certification:** The certification must detail the *manner, date, and recipient* of the delivery of the notice. (Citing *Hernandez v. Navarro*, 48 SCRA 44 (1972)). The SC found that the certification submitted during the petition was insufficient to prove actual receipt, as it only indicated that notices were "issued" but not received.

**Obligations:**

*   **CA Obligation:** To properly determine timeliness based on complete and proper service of the decision. To act on the motion for reconsideration on the merits.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for erroneous judgment if the motion for reconsideration had merit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The court heavily relies on the fact that the Postmaster certification, although presented, lacked crucial details regarding the *receipt* of notice.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** The case highlights the crucial importance of ensuring that parties are actually notified of decisions before periods for appeal or reconsideration begin to run. The CA's decision based solely on the issuance of notices jeopardizes due process.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13, Section 8:**  Governs the completeness of service by different methods.
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence, Section 3(m), Rule 131:** Deals with the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.
*   ***Hernandez v. Navarro*, 48 SCRA 44 (1972):**  Establishes the requirements for a valid postmaster certification to prove service by registered mail.
*   *Barrameda v. Castillo, No. L-27211, 6 July 1977, 78 SCRA 1*
*   *Garrido v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 101262, 14 September 1994, 236 SCRA 450*
*   *Johnson & Johnson (Phils.), Inc. v. Court Appeals, G. R. No. 99434, 24 September 1991, 201 SCRA 768*

**Conclusion:** The decision underscores the strict requirements for proving service by registered mail, particularly the need for concrete evidence of actual receipt of the notice of the registered mail. Failure to provide such evidence can render the service incomplete, affecting the timeliness of subsequent filings. It serves as a caution against relying solely on the presumption of regularity without substantiating it with specific details of service. The failure to provide these specific details was considered a grave abuse of discretion by the Court of Appeals.
