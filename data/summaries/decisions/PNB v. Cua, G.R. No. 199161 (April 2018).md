## Legal Document Summary: PNB v. James T. Cua, G.R. No. 199161 (April 18, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA Decision in a case for Sum of Money with Damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether PNB sufficiently proved that Respondent James Cua received the proceeds of a loan secured by a Time Deposit.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the Petition, reversing the CA and RTC rulings. The case was remanded to the lower court for proceedings on PNB's counterclaim.

**Facts:**

*   James Cua claimed PNB improperly applied his US Dollar Time Deposit (CTD No. B-630178) to pay off loans he allegedly never availed of, despite pre-signing loan documents.
*   PNB argued Cua *did* avail of the loans, evidenced by Promissory Notes (PNs), and that it properly set off his obligations against the time deposit.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **PNs as Evidence of Loan:** The Court emphasized that a promissory note is the best evidence of the existence of a loan, citing *Ycong v. Court of Appeals* (518 Phil. 240, 246 (2006)). The Court gave weight to PN No. 0011628152240006 dated 26 February 2002, due to the fact that James admitted he signed the note.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Section 9, Rules of Court):** The Court held that Cua failed to present "clear and convincing" evidence to overcome the presumption that the written agreement (PN) contained all the terms. His unsubstantiated claim that loan documents were pre-signed for pre-arranged loans was insufficient to deviate from the terms of the promissory note.
*   **Interplay of Promissory Notes and CTDs:** The court clarified the link between PN No. 0011628152240006 and CTD No. B-658788 (later CTD No. B-630178), which secured the loan. The court found that this promissory note was sufficient to show that James availed of the loan.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Borrower (James Cua):** Obligated to repay the loan as evidenced by the promissory note.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Counterclaim:** The remand for proceedings on PNB's counterclaim presents a risk to James Cua.
*   **Parol Evidence:** This case reinforces the difficulty in overcoming the parol evidence rule. Reliance on self-serving allegations, without corroborating evidence, is unlikely to succeed.
*   **Burden of Proof:** James failed to meet the burden of proving that the clear terms of the promissory note were not what he intended.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was whether James actually received the loan proceeds, which were directly addressed by looking at the promissory note as a whole.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Ycong v. Court of Appeals** - Regarding promissory notes as evidence of loan
*   **Rule 130, Section 9, Rules of Court** - Parol evidence rule
