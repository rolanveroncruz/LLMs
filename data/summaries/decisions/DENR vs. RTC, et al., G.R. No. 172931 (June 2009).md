**Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Regional Trial Court, G.R. NO. 172931, June 18, 2009 (607 Phil. 547)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari to annul the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the Republic's (represented by DENR) petition for annulment of judgment. The assailed judgment is a 1984 RTC decision confirming and registering land title in favor of the Recios.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **RTC Decision (1984):** Granted application for registration of title to Lot No. 900 in favor of the Recios.  Based on the facts, it appeared that the land was alienable and disposable at the time.
*   **OCT Issuance (1985):** Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 0-2107 was issued based on the RTC decision.
*   **DENR Protest (1997):** Occupants protested, alleging the land was forest/timberland and not subject to private appropriation.
*   **DENR Investigation (1998):** DENR investigation concluded Lot No. 900 fell within forest lands per LC Map No. 3132, established in 1986.  Recommended cancellation of OCT.
*   **Petition for Annulment (2002):**  Republic, through OSG, filed petition for annulment of judgment in the Court of Appeals, arguing the RTC lacked jurisdiction over forest land, citing Sec. 14 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).
*   **Recios' Argument:** The Recios countered that the RTC had jurisdiction, referencing their approved Plan LRC-SWO-14402 and BFD Map LC-2401 indicating the land was alienable and disposable since 1960. They also invoked res judicata.
*   **CA Decision:** Dismissed the petition for annulment due to insufficient evidence from the Republic to prove the land's forest status. CA cited the Best Evidence Rule (photocopies inadmissible without showing the original is lost) and noted the Republic's failure to rebut the Recios' 1976 Certification indicating alienable and disposable land.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Did the RTC lack jurisdiction in confirming title to land allegedly part of the public forest?
2.  **Burden of Proof:** Did the Republic meet its burden of establishing the inalienable character of the land in the annulment proceeding?

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision, finding that:

*   At the time of the application (1977) and the RTC decision (1984), the land was classified as alienable public land, based on the 1976 Certification from the Bureau of Forest Development.
*   The Republic failed to sufficiently prove the land was inalienable forest land in the annulment proceedings. Photocopies were inadmissible, and the evidence presented did not outweigh the existing classification at the time of the original registration.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14:**  Defines who may apply for registration of title and limits adjudication to "alienable and disposable lands of the public domain."
*   **Best Evidence Rule:** Applies to the admissibility of documentary evidence (photocopies vs. originals).

**Case Law References:**

*   **Philippine Banking Corporation vs. Court of Appeals:** Best Evidence Rule.
*   **De la Cruz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 120652:** Reiterates that forest lands are not subject to private appropriation.
*   **Ang Lam v. Rosillosa and Santiago, 86 Phil. 447:** A void judgment may be assailed at any time.
*   **Heirs of the Late Spouses Pedro S. Palanca and Soterranea Rafols Vda. de Palanca v. Republic, G.R. No. 151312:** Non-disposable public lands registered under the Land Registration Act may be recovered by the State at any time, and res judicata would not apply.
*   **Alipoon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127523 & Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115324:** Jurisdictional limits of the Supreme Court and conclusiveness of factual findings of lower courts.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Land Classifications:**  The key conflict lies between the 1976 Certification (alienable/disposable) and the 1998 DENR investigation (forest land based on 1986 project establishment). The timing of these classifications is crucial.
*   **Evidence Issues:** The Republic's reliance on photocopies and the DENR investigator's report, without presenting the original land classification map, was a significant evidentiary weakness.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:**  The Republic argued for the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by the DENR investigators. However, this presumption was seemingly overcome by the prior certification and the failure to present adequate evidence.

**Legal Analysis and Advice:**

The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the critical importance of the land's classification *at the time* of the application for registration. It also highlights the burden on the Republic to demonstrate that the land was, in fact, inalienable at that time. The failure to provide sufficient documentary evidence, particularly the original land classification map, was fatal to the Republic's case. The Recios were able to effectively defend their title by providing a certificate documenting the land's alienable and disposable nature at the crucial time frame.
