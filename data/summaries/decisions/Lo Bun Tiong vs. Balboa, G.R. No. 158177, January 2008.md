**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Benito Lo Bun Tiong and Caroline Siok Ching Teng vs. Vicente Balboa***

**Case:** G.R. No. 158177, January 28, 2008 (566 Phil. 492)

**Nature:** Petition questioning the CA decision affirming the RTC's decision in a collection suit, alleging forum shopping.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Benito Lo Bun Tiong and Caroline Siok Ching Teng
*   **Respondent:** Vicente Balboa

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Debt:** The case stems from three dishonored checks issued by Caroline Teng totaling P5,175,250.00 to Balboa.
*   **Civil Case (RTC-Manila):** Balboa filed a civil case (Civil Case No. 97-82225) against the spouses for collection of the sum of money. The RTC ruled in favor of Balboa.
*   **Criminal Cases (MTC-Manila):**  Separate criminal complaints for violation of B.P. Blg. 22 were filed against Caroline Teng covering the same checks. The MTC acquitted Caroline but held her civilly liable for the check amounts.
*   **Appeal History:**
    *   Spouses appealed the RTC (Civil case) decision to the CA (CA-G.R. CV No. 61457) which was affirmed *in toto.*
    *   Caroline appealed the MTC (Criminal case) decision regarding civil liability to the RTC (Criminal Case Nos. 02-204544-46). The RTC deleted the award of civil damages.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The filing of both the civil case and the criminal cases constitutes forum shopping.

**Legal Analysis & Holding:**

*   **Forum Shopping Defined:**  The Court reiterates the definition of forum shopping as instituting multiple actions based on the same cause of action with the expectation of a favorable ruling in at least one forum.
*   **Elements of Forum Shopping:** The court identifies the three elements of forum shopping that must be proven: (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for; and (3) such that a judgment in one case would operate as res judicata or litis pendentia in the other.
*   **Prior Case Law:** Petitioners relied on cases such as *Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corp. v. Asia Dynamic Electrix Corp.* (G.R. No. 163597) and *Silangan Textile Manufacturing Corp. v. Demetria* (G.R. No. 166719) which held that a civil action for the recovery of sum of money stemming from bouncing checks and the criminal violation of B.P. 22 constitute the same parties and the same causes of action, with an order to dismiss the civil action.
*   **Inapplicability of Circular 57-97/Rule 111(b):** The Supreme Court held that Supreme Court Circular No. 57-97 and Rule 111(b) of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (deeming the civil action for BP 22 violations to be included in the criminal case) are *not* applicable here because Civil Case No. 97-82225 was filed *before* the adoption of the said Rules.
*   **Applicable Rule: 1985 Rules of Court, Rule 111 Section 1:** The Court stated at the time of filing, the governing rule states that an action for recovery of civil liability stemming from the offense charged is necessarily included in the criminal proceedings, *unless* the civil action was filed prior to the criminal complaint.
*   **Reasoning:** Because the civil case was filed *prior* to the criminal cases, the civil case can proceed independently. Therefore, no forum shopping exists.
*   **Further Reasoning**: As the RTC (in the criminal case) has already deleted the award of civil damages, there is no double recovery or unjust enrichment.
*   **Holding:** Petition DENIED. CA decision AFFIRMED.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The Court places emphasis on the sequence of when the cases are filed. A potential risk lies in relying on the fact that Civil Case No. 97-82225 was filed *before* the criminal case, which permits separate and independent proceedings of the cases.
*   While the civil action was initiated first, the argument that it should be dismissed to prevent double recovery remains potentially valid and if not properly challenged can potentially impact the clients final outcome.
*   **Stare Decisis:**  The case confirms the importance of the timing of filing actions and that the 1985 Rules of Court will apply as they were the governing rule at the time of filing.
