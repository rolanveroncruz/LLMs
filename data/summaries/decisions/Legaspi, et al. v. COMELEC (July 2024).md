## Legal Document Summary: Legaspi v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 264661

**Nature of Document:** Decision by the Supreme Court (En Banc) on a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Clarylyn A. Legaspi et al. (representing voters of Pangasinan)
*   **Respondent:** Commission on Elections (COMELEC)

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Voters in Pangasinan were denied their rights (suffrage, petition, information) due to COMELEC's inaction on their request ("APELA") for a manual recount of the May 9, 2022 election results, allegedly due to widespread fraud. Petitioners argue that reliance on vote counting machines led to an unfair election.
*   **COMELEC's Position:** The petition lacks merit due to defective verification, lack of *locus standi* (no direct injury), no actual case/controversy, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. They argue the "APELA" was unclear and did not conform with electoral protest or People's Initiative requirements.
*   **Core Issues Before the Court:**
    1.  Defective Verification by Petitioners
    2.  *Locus Standi* of Petitioners
    3.  Whether the Petition is a valid Class Suit
    4.  Existence of an Actual Case or Controversy
    5.  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
    6.  Propriety of Certiorari and Mandamus

**Court's Ruling (Dismissal):**

The Court dismissed the petition, finding:

*   **Defective Verification:** Petitioners lacked sufficient *personal knowledge* to verify the petition. Their claims were based on hearsay (social media, unverified sources), not personal experience or authenticated documents, thus, did not meet requirements of Rule 7 Section 4 of the 2019 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   ***Locus Standi* Deficient:** Petitioners lacked direct, personal injury. Their concerns were a general grievance shared by the public, not a specific, concrete harm. While recognizing the potential "transcendental importance," there was no "clear and imminent threat to fundamental rights" that would justify relaxing standing requirements
*   **Not a Valid Class Suit:** Petitioners failed to prove they adequately represented the purported class (71,000+ signatories) and the lack of signature pages hampered verification and authorization. Thus, it failed to satisfy Rule 3, Section 12 of the 2019 Rules of Court.
*   **No Actual Case/Controversy:** No violation of petitioners' constitutional rights. They voted, and COMELEC's responses to the unclear "APELA" did not constitute a denial of their rights, especially the right of suffrage.
*   **Administrative Remedies Not Exhausted:** Petitioners failed to utilize COMELEC's FOI manual for requesting information before seeking judicial relief. The Court noted COMELEC's established FOI procedures (Resolution No. 10685) provided sufficient remedies.
*   **Certiorari & Mandamus Inappropriate:** No grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC and a clear legal right to the specific relief sought.

    * The Court found the the actions were not Ministerial, thus, Mandamus cannot be applied. Rather, the COMELEC must exercise discretion.

*   **Executive Order No. 2 (Series of 2016)** (Operationalizing in the Executive Branch the People's Constitutional Right to Information)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Concrete Proof:** The biggest risk for the petitioners was the absence of concrete evidence to support their claims of election fraud, leading to the "hearsay" conclusion.
*   **Unclear Relief Sought:** The ambiguous nature of the "APELA," coupled with the reliance on unsupported opinions, weakened the petition.
*   **FOI Procedures:** The decision highlights the importance of adhering to established FOI procedures. The case demonstrates that a general assertion of the right to information is insufficient without a specific request for identifiable records.
*   **Recourse:** It may be open to the petitioners to refile with concrete evidence that addresses the standing and procedural issues that were fatal in this case.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed COMELEC's actions, emphasizing the need for petitioners to comply with established legal procedures when seeking remedies related to elections and the right to information. The decision underscored the judiciary's reluctance to intervene in matters within the competence of the COMELEC, particularly absent a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion or the violation of a specific legal right. The case clarifies the relationship between FOI claims and established FOI administrative procedures.
