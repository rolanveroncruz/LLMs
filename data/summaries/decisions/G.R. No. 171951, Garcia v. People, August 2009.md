## Legal Document Summary: *Garcia v. People*, G.R. No. 171951 (2009)

**Nature:** Review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court conviction for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** The petitioner, Amado Garcia, was found guilty of Homicide for the death of Manuel Chy. The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction.
*   **Cause of Death:** The victim, Chy, died of myocardial infarction. The Courts found that the assault by Garcia, while not directly causing the heart attack, triggered it due to the emotional distress it caused, exacerbating Chy's pre-existing heart condition (mild fibrosis of the myocardium).
*   **Proximate Cause:** The court applied Article 4(1) of the Revised Penal Code, holding Garcia liable because the myocardial infarction was a direct, natural, and logical consequence of his felonious act (assault). Cites *United States v. Brobst* (1909) and *United States v. Rodriguez* (1912) for the principle that a pre-existing condition doesn't absolve the aggressor if the assault hastens death. Also, the Court mentioned the "el que es causa de la causa es causa del mal causado" principle.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:** The Court considered as a mitigating circumstance that Garcia did not intend so grave a wrong as the death of Chy.
*   **Penalty:** The SC affirmed the indeterminate sentence of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 14 years and 8 months of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Death Indemnity: Affirmed at P50,000.
    *   Funerary Expenses: Affirmed at P200,000 (based on stipulation).
    *   Moral Damages: Reduced to P50,000.
    *   Loss of Earning Capacity: Increased to P1,229,600 (using formula from *People v. Malinao*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Garcia):** Liable for Homicide and ordered to pay the heirs of Manuel Chy the following: P50,000 civil indemnity, P200,000 for wake and burial expenses, and P1,229,600 for loss of earning capacity.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Causation Issue:** The central argument revolved around causation â€“ whether Garcia's actions were the proximate cause of Chy's death given the pre-existing heart condition. The court's reliance on Article 4(1) and the "cause of the cause" principle could be challenged on the basis of whether the emotional distress induced by the assault was a reasonably foreseeable consequence.
*   **Judicial Notice of Salary:** The court took judicial notice of the victim's salary. While this is permissible, it should be determined whether it could stand with the rules of evidence for judicial notice.
*   **Calculation of Loss of Earning Capacity:** The calculation of loss of earning capacity, specifically the percentage attributed to living expenses is another point for scrutiny, although the Supreme Court already resolved in the decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 249, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Homicide.
*   **Article 4(1), Revised Penal Code:** Criminal liability for consequences different from those intended.
*   **Article 13(3), Revised Penal Code:** Mitigating circumstance of lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Governing the imposition of indeterminate sentences.
*   ***United States v. Brobst* (1909):** Establishes that a pre-existing condition doesn't absolve the aggressor if the assault contributes to death.
*   ***United States v. Rodriguez* (1912):** Similar principle regarding pre-existing conditions.
*   ***People v. Malinao*:** The Court adopted the formula used in this case, which is for calculating loss of earning capacity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies primarily in the *causation* element. Was the myocardial infarction a direct, natural, and logical consequence of the assault, or was it primarily attributable to the pre-existing condition? The court found a causal link, but this could be a point of contention.
