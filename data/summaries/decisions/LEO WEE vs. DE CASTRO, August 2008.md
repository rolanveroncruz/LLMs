## Legal Document Summary: *Leo Wee v. George De Castro*, G.R. No. 176405 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an ejectment case (unlawful detainer).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision ordering Leo Wee (petitioner) to vacate the leased premises and pay back rentals, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** The SC determined the lease agreement was month-to-month based on the rental payment schedule (Art. 1687, Civil Code).  The absence of a fixed period allows the lessor to demand ejectment at the end of each month.
*   **Rental Increase:** Petitioner's refusal to pay the agreed-upon rental increase of ₱15,000 per month constitutes a breach of the lease agreement, justifying rescission by the lessor (Chua v. Victorio).
*   **Vacate Property:** Petitioner is ordered to vacate the property.
*   **Payment Arrears:** Petitioner is held liable for unpaid increase rent from Oct 2001-Feb 2002 and from March 2002 until he vacates, with legal interest (6% until finality, 12% thereafter).
*   **Attorney's Fees and Costs:**  Petitioner must pay ₱20,000 as attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner liable for breach of lease due to non-payment of increased rent.
*   Petitioner liable for back rentals, attorney's fees, and costs of the suit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1687, Civil Code:** Determines lease period based on rental payment frequency.
*   **Art. 487, Civil Code:**  Allows a co-owner to bring an action in ejectment without joining all co-owners.
*   **Art. 1659, Civil Code:** Affirms right to resicission in lease agreements if lessee fails to uphold statutory obligation.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay Law)/R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Addresses conciliation as pre-condition to filling cases in court.
*   **Chua v. Victorio, G.R. No. 157568 (2004):** Confirms lessor's right to rescind the lease for non-payment of demanded increased rental.
*   **Carandang v. Heirs of De Guzman, G.R. No. 160347 (2006):** Explains co-owner's rights in ejectment actions.
*   **Mendoza v. Coronel, G.R. No. 156402 (2006):** Clarifies requirements for attorney-in-fact filing ejectment.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Compliance with Conciliation Requirement:** The MTC and RTC initially dismissed the case for failure to comply with Barangay conciliation. The SC ultimately ruled that the conciliation proceedings regarding the rental increase encompassed the issue of possession, satisfying the requirement.  This could be a point of contention if the scope of the conciliation was genuinely limited.
*   **Lack of "Unlawful Withholding" Allegation:** The petitioner argued the complaint lacked the jurisdictional allegation of "unlawful withholding." The SC found that the allegations, although worded differently, sufficiently demonstrated unlawful detainer, consistent with *Barba v. Court of Appeals*.

**Key Arguments & Court's Rationale:**

1.  **Conciliation:** SC held that Barangay conciliation on rental increase was sufficient, given the circumstances, including the issue of possession.
2.  **Pleadings:** Absence of exact phrase "unlawful withholding" was not fatal as the allegations sufficiently established the cause of action for unlawful detainer.
3.  **Authority to Sue:**  George de Castro could file the action even without joining all co-owners (Art. 487, Civil Code) and had authority through SPAs (treated as surplusage by the Court).
4.  **IBP Dues:** The SC dismissed the IBP dues issue as moot because the Counsel complied with the court requirment during proceedings.
