## Legal Document Summary - GSIS vs. Court of Appeals & SEC vs. Rosete, et al.

**Case:** *Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) vs. Court of Appeals (CA), Anthony V. Rosete, et al.* (G.R. No. 183905) and *Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Anthony V. Rosete, et al.* (G.R. No. 184275).

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions challenging a CA decision that nullified a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) and Show Cause Order (SCO) issued by the SEC concerning proxy validation for a Manila Electric Company (Meralco) stockholders' meeting.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the SEC had jurisdiction to issue the CDO and SCO regarding the proxy validation.
    *   GSIS argued SEC jurisdiction under Sections 20.1 (proxy solicitations) and 53.1 (investigations) of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), claiming irregularities in the proxy solicitation process.
    *   Rosete, et al. contended that jurisdiction rested exclusively with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) as an intra-corporate controversy per Section 5.2 of the SRC, transferring jurisdiction of Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A(intra-corporate disputes) to the RTC. They classified the GSIS complaint as an election contest, referencing Section 2, Rule 6 of the Interim Rules on Intra-Corporate Controversies.

*   **Decision:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that the SEC lacked jurisdiction. The SC reasoned that while the SEC regulates proxy solicitation, the controversy here related directly to the *election of directors* within the company, thus falling under the RTC's exclusive jurisdiction as an election contest within the meaning of Sec. 5(c) of PD 902-A. The Court stressed that allowing the SEC to hear the case would create split jurisdiction.

*   **Validity of CDO/SCO:** SC declared the CDO invalid on multiple grounds:
    *   It was issued by only one SEC Commissioner (Martinez), violating the SEC's collegial nature (referencing *GMCR v. Bell*). Delegation of authority to one commissioner was improper.
    *   It was unclear which provision of the SRC (Sections 5(i), 53.3, or 64) the CDO was based on, failing to provide sufficient clarity and due process.

*   **Sanctions on GSIS Lawyers:** The CA imposed sanctions on GSIS lawyers for unauthorized practice of law and forum shopping. The SC reversed these sanctions, holding that GSIS charter (PD 1146, as amended by RA 8291) allows it's in-house legal counsel to appear without being displaced by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC).

*   **Expunction of SEC Petition (G.R. No. 184275):** The SC expunged the SEC's petition, reasoning that the SEC and its officers were not real parties-in-interest in the intra-corporate dispute. They were merely public respondents in the CA case and had no standing to appeal the decision.

**Case Law:**

*   *GMCR v. Bell*, G.R. No. 126496 (1997) - Collegial nature of regulatory bodies.
*   *Santiago v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 46845 (1990) - Standing to sue.
*   *Southern Cross Cement Corporation v. Philcemcor*, G.R. No. 158540 (2004) - Split jurisdiction

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Preemptive Strike Concern:** The SC noted, but ultimately disregarded, the CA's declaration barring the GSIS from refiling the case as an election contest in the RTC.
*   **Election Contest Deadlines:** The SC implied that such declaration of the CA was not proper and if the fifteen (15) day prescriptive period to file an election contest had already passed, a new case would be considered.
*   **Improper Proxy Solicitation/Validation in Non-Director Elections:** The SC left open the possibility of SEC jurisdiction over proxy-related issues not tied to the election of directors but affecting other intra-corporate matters.
*   **Effects of Corporate Power Struggle:** The SC acknowledged that the case arose within the context of a heated Meralco power struggle but sought to ignore the personalities involved and focus solely on legal questions.

**Conclusion:**

This case solidifies the principle that disputes directly related to the election of corporate directors, including proxy validation challenges, fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the RTC as election contests. The SEC's power to regulate proxy solicitations remains but is subordinate to the RTC's jurisdiction when an actual election of directors is at stake. The decision also reiterates the collegial nature of the SEC and the importance of due process in its proceedings, particularly regarding the issuance of CDOs.
