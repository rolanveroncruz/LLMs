## Legal Document Summary - *Aledro-Ruña v. Lead Export and Agro-Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 225896)

**Nature:** Certiorari appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a case for unlawful detainer, damages, and attorney's fees. The RTC dismissed the case on the ground of res judicata.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Two parcels of land (Lots 3014 and 5722) registered under the name of Segundo Aledro.
*   **Conflicting Claims:** Petitioner (heir of Segundo Aledro) claims better right of possession. Respondent (Lead Export) claims right of possession based on a lease contract from Ringor (alleged subsequent buyer of the land), who acquired from Advento (who allegedly purchased from Segundo Aledro).
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. 95-13):** A prior case filed by the heirs of Segundo against Advento and FADI (merged into Lead Export) for declaration of nullity of deed and damages was dismissed "with prejudice" upon motion of the plaintiffs (including Petitioner). This dismissal formed the basis of the res judicata defense.
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. 41-2005):** An action by Sofia, widow of Segundo, against Advento for Declaration of Nullity of Deed of Sale and Quieting of Title which ruled in favor of Sofia. It declared the deed of absolute sale executed by Segundo in favor of Advento on March 24, 1981 was declared as null and void.
*   **Current Action (Civil Case No. 218-10):** Unlawful detainer action filed by Petitioner against Respondent.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** To prove a better right of possession to the land.
*   **Respondent:** To demonstrate lawful possession based on its lease agreement and prior transactions.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Res Judicata:** While the prior dismissal was "with prejudice," the Supreme Court found that the order granting the dismissal did not comply with Sec. 2, Rule 17 as it did not clearly set forth therein the terms and conditions for the dismissal. Also, no legal declaration of the parties' rights and liabilities. This formed a risk that the lower courts might apply res judicata. This ambiguity was resolved by the Supreme Court to favor the petitioner.
*   **Validity of the Deed of Sale:** The initial deed of sale from Segundo to Advento, the foundation of respondent's claim, was declared null and void in Civil Case No. 41-2005.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The status of Ringor, Gonzales, and Cabuñas (subsequent buyers) as good faith purchasers is questionable, given that they did not deal directly with the registered owner and the titles remained in Segundo's name. The Court ultimately determined they were *not* good faith purchasers.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to questions of law, with exceptions for manifest error.
*   **Section 2, Rule 17, Rules of Court:** Governs dismissal upon motion of plaintiff, requiring court approval and specifying terms and conditions.
*   **Rule 36, Rules of Court:** Governs the form and content of judgments, requiring a reasoned decision with facts and law stated clearly.
*   **Res Judicata Elements:** Defined as (1) final judgment/order; (2) jurisdiction; (3) judgment on the merits; (4) identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action. *Cebu State College of Science and Technology v. Misterio, et al., 760 Phil. 672, 684 (2015).*
*   **Act No. 496, Sec 44:** Prohibits acquiring title to registered land by prescription or adverse possession.
*   **Laches:** Cannot be set up against an imprescriptible legal right.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision and **reinstated** the MCTC's decision in favor of the Petitioner. The Court held that:

*   Res judicata does not apply because the prior dismissal lacked a true determination of the parties' rights and liabilities.
*   The final and executory decision in Civil Case No. 41-2005 declaring the deed of absolute sale executed by Segundo in favor of Advento as null and void.
*   Ringor, Gonzales, and Cabuñas were not good faith purchasers, and thus, their rights are subordinate to the registered owner's. The petitioner, as heir of the registered owner, has a better right to possess.
*   An action to recover possession of registered land does not prescribe.
*   Laches is not applicable.
