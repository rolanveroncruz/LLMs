**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflicting Accounts:** There are differing accounts of the attorney-client relationship, including alleged contigency fee arrangement, and the extent of communications between the client and counsel; as well as the fault for losing the case in the first place.
*   **Atty. Obmina's Defense:** Atty. Obmina's attempt to shift blame to Carandang (failure to provide information, failure to pay appeal fees) could be interpreted as a lack of acceptance of responsibility, potentially aggravating the disciplinary measure.
*   **Extraterritorial Jurisdiction:** The fact that Atty. Obmina resides outside the Philippines raises questions about the enforceability of the suspension, though the Court asserted that his prior negligence while practicing in the Philippines warrants disciplinary action.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's decision to suspend Atty. Obmina for a year. The case highlights the critical importance of lawyer-client communication and the consequences of neglecting a client's case. Atty. Obmina's inaction resulted in Carandang losing his right to appeal, justifying the disciplinary action.
