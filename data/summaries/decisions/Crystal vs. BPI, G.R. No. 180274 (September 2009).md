## Legal Document Summary: Crystal vs. BPI, G.R. No. 180274

This Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 180274) involves a dispute over the excess proceeds from an extrajudicial foreclosure. The core issue is whether the mortgagors, Virgilio and Glynna Crystal, are entitled to interest on the surplus amount after the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) foreclosed on their property following their default on a loan.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Petitioners obtained a P3,000,000 loan from Citytrust (later absorbed by BPI) secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** BPI foreclosed on the mortgage due to the petitioners' failure to pay.
*   **Deficiency Claim:** BPI initially sued for a deficiency, alleging the foreclosure sale proceeds did not cover the outstanding debt and related expenses.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC reduced the outstanding obligation, found a surplus from the foreclosure sale, and ordered BPI to return the surplus with 12% interest per annum from the date of the sale.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision but deleted the award of interest on the surplus.

**Obligations:**

*   **BPI's Obligation:** To return the surplus (P319,111.35) from the foreclosure sale to the Crystals.

**Liabilities:**

*   **BPI's Liability:**  To pay legal interest on the surplus from the date of the RTC judgment (September 27, 2004) at 6% per annum until the finality of the Supreme Court decision, and thereafter at 12% per annum until fully satisfied.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Rate Dispute:** The original loan allegedly carried a 27% interest rate, which the petitioners challenged as a violation of the Truth in Lending Act. However, the focus of this appeal is solely on the interest due on the surplus.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:**  The Court invokes the principle of unjust enrichment (Art. 22 of the Civil Code) as the basis for awarding interest.
*   **Reliance on *Dio v. Japor*:** BPI's reliance on *Dio v. Japor* (G.R. No. 154129) was misplaced because *Dio* concerned a situation where the true price of the land during foreclosure, after equitable adjustments, effectively eliminated any surplus. In this case, the lower courts' recomputation of the debt confirmed the existence of a surplus.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 68, Section 4, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs the distribution of proceeds from foreclosure sales, mandating the return of any surplus to the mortgagor.
*   **Article 22, Civil Code:** Principle of unjust enrichment.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Dio v. Japor* (G.R. No. 154129):** Distinguished by the court, as in that case the surplus was eliminated after interest rates was adjusted to equitable levels.
*   ***LCK Industries Inc. v. Planters Development Bank* (G.R. No. 170606):**  Cited regarding the imposition of legal interest in unjust enrichment cases and the applicable rates (6% until finality, then 12%).
*   ***Construction Development Corp. of the Phils. v. Estrella* (G.R. No. 147791):**  Cited regarding the start date for calculating legal interest (from the date of judgment, not the filing of the complaint).
*   **Philippine Airlines v. NLRC 328 Phil. 814 (1996):** Confirms that the imposition of legal interest on monetary awards is subject to the court's discretion.

**Summary of Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, modifying the Court of Appeals' decision. BPI must return the surplus to the Crystals with interest. The interest is calculated at 6% per annum from the date of the RTC judgment until the finality of the Supreme Court decision, and then at 12% per annum until the judgment is fully satisfied. The decision emphasizes the equitable principle of preventing unjust enrichment.
