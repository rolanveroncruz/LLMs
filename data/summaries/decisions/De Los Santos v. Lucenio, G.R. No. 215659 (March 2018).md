## Legal Document Summary: *Analyn De Los Santos vs. Joel Lucenio*, G.R. No. 215659 (2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's affirmance of the MTC's decision in an ejectment/unlawful detainer case.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Property Dispute:** Petitioners (De Los Santos) claim right to property based on Deed of Conditional Sale from GSIS. Respondent (Lucenio) claims prior right through a Deed of Transfer of Rights from his sister, who originally had a housing loan with GSIS.
*   **Procedural History:** MTC ruled for Petitioners; RTC affirmed. CA reversed, citing GSIS's non-compliance with the Maceda Law (RA 6552).
*   **Central Issue:** Whether the CA erred in considering the issue of Maceda Law compliance, which was not raised in the lower courts.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **MTC/RTC Ruling:** Lucenio ordered to vacate the property and pay monthly compensation (P5,000) for use and occupation from May 16, 2010, plus attorney's fees (P20,000) and costs of suit.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reinstates MTC and RTC decisions. Lucenio must vacate, pay compensation, attorney's fees, and costs. Compensation is subject to 6% interest per annum from May 16, 2010, until the finality of the decision, and thereafter, 6% per annum on the total amount due until fully paid, per *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* and BSP Circular No. 799.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Change of Theory:** The core legal issue revolves around the prohibition against raising new issues on appeal. The CA erred in considering the Maceda Law argument because Lucenio did not raise it as a defense in his Answer or Pre-Trial Brief before the MTC or RTC. This violates Petitioners' due process rights. *Peña v. Spouses Tolentino* cited as a case on changing theories on appeal.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The court rejected the argument that the MTC and RTC should have taken judicial notice of the Maceda Law, as compliance with the law is a factual matter requiring specific pleading and evidence, which Lucenio failed to provide.
*   **Maceda Law Applicability:** The court did not rule definitively on whether the Maceda Law applies to the specific situation (two buyers from GSIS), but highlighted that even if it did apply, Lucenio's argument failed because it was raised for the first time on appeal, preventing the petitioners from presenting the notarized letter of cancellation.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The interest calculation on the compensation is clearly defined, referencing *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* and BSP Circular No. 799 to prevent ambiguity.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6552 (Maceda Law):**  Cited by the CA as the basis for reversing the lower courts' decisions, but the SC ultimately deemed the CA's reliance on it as erroneous due to the issue not being raised at trial.
*   **Rule 44, Section 15 of the Rules of Court:** Prohibits raising issues on appeal that were not raised in the lower courts.
*   *Peña v. Spouses Tolentino*, 657 Phil. 352 (2011): Case cited regarding changing the theory of the case on appeal.
*   *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013) and BSP Circular No. 799:  Governs the imposition of legal interest.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision due to the Respondent's improper attempt to introduce new legal arguments (Maceda Law compliance) on appeal. The decision emphasizes the importance of raising all relevant defenses and arguments at the trial court level. The Court reinstated the MTC and RTC decisions, ordering Lucenio to vacate the property, pay compensation, and cover legal costs.
