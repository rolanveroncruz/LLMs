## Legal Document Summary - *Garcia v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. Nos. 205904-06, October 17, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the Sandiganbayan's Resolution denying a Motion for Reconsideration and lifting of Hold Departure Orders (HDOs).

**Facts:** Petitioner, Gwendolyn F. Garcia, former Governor of Cebu, was charged with violations of Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code (Technical Malversation) related to the allegedly irregular purchase of the Balili Estate by the Cebu Provincial Government. The Sandiganbayan issued HDOs against her.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Charges:** Violation of Sections 3(e) and 3(g) of R.A. 3019 and Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **HDOs:** Issued by the Sandiganbayan to prevent the petitioner from leaving the Philippines.
*   **Bail:** Petitioner posted bail, thereby submitting to the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Potential conviction for violations of R.A. 3019 and the Revised Penal Code, leading to imprisonment and other penalties.
*   **Restricted Travel:** HDOs restrict the petitioner's right to travel.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Sandiganbayan maintains jurisdiction over the case, requiring the petitioner's presence for proceedings.

**Key Arguments & Contentions:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:**
    *   Sandiganbayan lacks the statutory authority to issue HDOs.
    *   HDOs violate the constitutional right to travel.
    *   HDOs were prematurely issued due to a pending motion for reconsideration before the Ombudsman.
*   **Sandiganbayan's Position:**
    *   The court has the inherent power to issue HDOs to maintain jurisdiction.
    *   The right to travel is not absolute and can be restricted in the interest of justice.
    *   The pendency of a motion for reconsideration does not suspend the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The Scope of Sandiganbayan's Inherent Powers:**  The petitioner disputes that the inherent powers of the Sandiganbayan extend to issuing HDOs, arguing a lack of express statutory authorization.  The Court rejects this, holding that inherent powers exist by virtue of being a court.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *DISMISSED* the petition, upholding the Sandiganbayan's authority to issue HDOs. The Court found that the HDOs were validly issued pursuant to its inherent powers as a court of justice.

**Potential Risks:** The petitioner remains subject to the HDOs and must seek permission from the Sandiganbayan for any international travel. Conviction in the underlying criminal cases remains a significant risk.
