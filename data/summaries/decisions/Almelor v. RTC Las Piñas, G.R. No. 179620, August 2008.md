## Legal Document Summary: *Manuel G. Almelor v. The Hon. Regional Trial Court of Las Pi√±as City, Branch 254, and Leonida T. Almelor* G.R. No. 179620

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari concerning the Court of Appeals' (CA) denial of a petition for annulment of judgment, affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision to annul the marriage between Manuel Almelor (Petitioner) and Leonida Almelor (Respondent). The RTC granted the annulment based on fraud (concealment of homosexuality) under Article 45 of the Family Code, despite Leonida's initial petition being based on psychological incapacity under Article 36.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Marriage Annulment (Article 45, Family Code):** The RTC annulled the marriage based on *fraud*, specifically the concealment of homosexuality, rather than the psychological incapacity originally alleged.
*   **Community Property Dissolution & Forfeiture:** The RTC dissolved the community property regime and ordered the forfeiture of Manuel's share in favor of the children.
*   **Child Support:** The RTC ordered Manuel to provide monthly financial support to the children.
*   **Custody and Visitation:** Custody of the children was awarded to Leonida, with visitation rights granted to Manuel.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Erroneous Application of Law:** The RTC erred in annulling the marriage based on homosexuality *per se* rather than *concealment* of homosexuality at the time of marriage, as per Article 46(4) of the Family Code.  The Court in Villanueva v. Court of Appeals reiterated the need to prove vitiation of consent.
*   **Improper Dissolution of Community Property:** The dissolution and forfeiture of Manuel's share of the community property were premature and legally unfounded, as the marriage was deemed valid.
*   **Ineffective Counsel:** Petitioner's previous counsel made repeated procedural errors, including filing the wrong remedies and failing to meet deadlines, potentially causing prejudice to the Petitioner's rights.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Evidence for Concealment:** There was insufficient evidence presented to prove that Manuel was homosexual *at the time of marriage* and actively concealed this fact from Leonida. The RTC's decision appears to rely heavily on circumstantial evidence and speculation.  This is a critical point for potential reversal.
*   **Procedural Issues:** The CA dismissed the petition for annulment of judgment as the wrong remedy. This Supreme Court case addresses and attempts to correct these procedural errors in the interest of justice, treating the CA petition as one for certiorari under Rule 65. Nerves v. Civil Service Commission and Tan v. Dumarpa.
*   **Disputed Facts:** The parties presented conflicting accounts of their marital life, with Leonida alleging cruelty and suspicions of homosexuality, while Manuel claimed a generally harmonious relationship.
*   **Ground for Annulment vs. Legal Separation:** Note Justice Caguioa's remarks that Article 46 discusses "concealment" whereas legal separation deals with "actuality."

**Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code:** Articles 36 (Psychological Incapacity), 45(3) (Fraud as ground for annulment), 46(4) (Concealment of Homosexuality), 96 (Administration of Community Property), 124 (Administration of Conjugal Partnership)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 47 (Annulment of Judgment), Rule 65 (Certiorari)

**Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. Molina (G.R. No. 108763):** Referenced regarding the proper guidelines for establishing psychological incapacity, which the RTC failed to apply.
*   **Villanueva v. Court of Appeals:** The court in this case also failed to prove fraud, resulting in a vitiated marital consent, which led to this courts consideration of the present case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's interpretation of "fraud" under Article 45(3) to include homosexuality *per se* rather than the *concealment* of homosexuality existing at the time of the marriage.
*   The RTC's decision to dissolve and forfeit Manuel's share of the community property without a valid basis for annulment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing and setting aside the CA's decision and dismissing the petition to annul the marriage. This decision hinged on the RTC's erroneous legal reasoning in annulling the marriage based on homosexuality per se rather than the concealment of homosexuality, as well as the importance of rectifying procedural errors in the interests of justice. The order dissolving and forfeiting the community property was also deemed invalid. The marriage remains legally valid and subsisting.
