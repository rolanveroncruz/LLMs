Okay, here is a legal summary of *Espino v. Amora*, G.R. No. 172816, March 3, 2008:

**Case Summary: *Espino v. Amora***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in a collection of sum of money case.

**Facts:**

*   Respondents (Amora), doing business as NBA Enterprises, supplied construction materials on credit to Petitioner (Espino), who owned D.N. Tuangco Construction and CEJ Construction.
*   Espino allegedly owed Amora P1,992,839.64. While Espino remitted P2,085,000.00, Amora claimed an outstanding balance of P916,208.77 including a 3% monthly interest.
*   Espino argued full payment and challenged the 3% monthly interest as usurious, citing a 12% *per annum* rate in the delivery receipts.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of Amora but was later reconsidered and reduced the judgement.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC's finding of a subsisting obligation, but modified the interest to 12% *per annum* and reduced attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Sale on Credit:** The Court affirmed the existence of a contract of sale on credit, triggering Article 1589 of the Civil Code, which allows interest accrual on the unpaid purchase price.
*   **Interest Rate:** The central issue is the interest rate. The CA correctly reduced the unilaterally imposed 3% monthly interest to 12% *per annum*, in line with established jurisprudence regarding unconscionable interest rates. *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78, 95, regarding legal interest rates, may apply.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Reduced from 25% to 10% of the amount collectible, deemed reasonable by the CA. *Titan Construction Corporation v. Uni-Field Enterprises, Inc.*,G.R. No. 153874, March 1, 2007.
*   **Outstanding Obligation:**  The Supreme Court ruled that Espino's outstanding obligation is P818,342.56, plus legal interest, attorney's fees and costs.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Espino is liable for:**
    *   Principal Debt: P818,342.56
    *   Interest: 12% per annum from the date of judicial demand (November 10, 1997) until fully paid. Legal interest of 12% per annum on the total amount due from the finality of this decision until fully paid
    *   Attorneyâ€™s fees: 10% of the amount due
    *   Costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** The precise calculation of interest from November 10, 1997, at 12% *per annum* needs careful scrutiny.
*   **Estoppel:** Espino's prior acquiescence to the statements of account and the Deed of Assignment played a significant role.  Her belated challenge was deemed an attempt to "inveigle out of the established arrangement," estopping her from denying the debt's validity.
*   **Usury/Unconscionable Interest:** The original 3% monthly interest was deemed implicitly unconscionable, leading to the CA's modification.
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court upheld the factual findings of the lower courts, emphasizing the high degree of respect given to such findings unless exceptions are met (grounds for factual findings can be contested if any of these grounds are met: speculation, abuse of discretion, findings go beyond the issues of the case).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1589 of the Civil Code:** Regarding the vendee's obligation to pay interest.
*   **Article 1625 of the Civil Code:** Pertaining to the effect of assignment of credit against third persons (re: Deed of Assignment).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial discrepancy between the invoice terms (12% *per annum*) and the imposed (3% monthly) created the core dispute.
*   Espino's claim of overpayment was undermined by the ongoing credit line and her failure to specifically deny the total amount owed.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Verify Interest Calculation:**  Confirm the correct interest calculation from November 10, 1997, at 12% *per annum*.
2.  **Review Payment Records:**  Analyze all payment records to ensure accurate crediting against the principal and accrued interest.
3.  **Assess Legal Interest:** Analyze the legal interest rate that should be applied to the final amount due starting from the finality of the SC decision, in line with *Cuyco v. Cuyco, G.R. No. 168736, April 19, 2006, 487 SCRA 693*.
