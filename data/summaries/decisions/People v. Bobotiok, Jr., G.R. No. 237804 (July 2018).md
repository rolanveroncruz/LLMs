**Case Summary: People v. Bobotiok, Jr. (G.R. No. 237804, July 4, 2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC conviction of Mercindo Bobotiok, Jr. for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act), specifically illegal delivery of *shabu*.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Initially charged with sale, delivery, and giving away of dangerous drugs (Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165).
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of illegal *sale*.  Found elements of illegal sale present; PO1 Balbin's failure to give the marked money was not fatal; chain of custody unbroken despite inventory lacking required witnesses; and presumption of integrity was not overcome.
*   **CA Ruling:** Modified to illegal *delivery* instead of illegal *sale*, as payment not effected; elements of illegal delivery present; chain of custody intact.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** *Acquitted* due to *break* in Chain of Custody;
      *   Section 5, Art. II, RA 9165. - The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.
*   **Section 21, Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, x x x so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner: (1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the dangerous drugs x x x shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the seized items and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, with an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; Provided, That the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or. at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided,finally, That noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Key issue.  The Supreme Court found *missing links*, mainly:
    *   *Insufficient Justification for non-compliance of Sec 21*: Inventory and photograph not done at the place of arrest with required witnesses (elected public official, NPS representative, or media). PO1 Balbin's reason of darkness and security are deemed insufficient and afterthought.
    *   *Missing Details:* Details of turnover from the police station to the crime laboratory and from the crime laboratory to the court were missing. Testimony of PCI Mangalip, PO2 Medrano, and PO2 del Rosario was dispensed, failing to establish every link of chain of custody. Stipulations were insufficient.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution:** Must establish all elements of the crime and a continuous, unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of evidence, particularly in drug cases.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21, RA 9165, regarding handling of seized drugs. Must provide justifiable reasons and documentation for any deviations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Police Abuse:** The Supreme Court acknowledges the potential for abuse in buy-bust operations, emphasizing the need for procedural safeguards.
*   **Break in Chain of Custody:** Failure to meticulously document and adhere to chain of custody protocols can lead to acquittal due to reasonable doubt regarding the evidence's integrity.
*   **Failure to comply with Sec. 21:** Noncompliance with Sec. 21, RA 9165 can render the seizure invalid.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** Defines and penalizes illegal activities related to dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 21:** Outlines procedures for custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   **People v. Michael Maongco y Yumonda and Phans Bandali y Simpal, G.R. No. 196966, October 23, 2013** Cites that delivery may be committed even without consideration.

*   **People of the Philippines v. Fernando Ranche Havana a.k.a. Fernando Ranche Abana, G.R. No. 198450, January 11, 2016** defines Chain of Custody
*   **People of the Philippines v. Eddie Barte y Mendoza, G.R. No. 179749, March 1, 2017.** Time and again, this Court had taken judicial notice that buy-bust operations are "susceptible to police abuse, the most notorious of which is its use as a tool for extortion."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" Exception in Section 21, RA 9165:** The Court is strict in requiring demonstration of genuine impediments and preservation of integrity when invoking this exception. The prosecution's explanation of darkness, security issues and only contacting the media and Barangay are insufficient to justify non-compliance with Sec. 21.
*   **Stipulation of Facts:** The stipulations regarding the Forensic Chemist and IO were insufficient to establish a complete chain of custody.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court acquitted the accused due to a failure by the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody as required by RA 9165, Section 21. Insufficient justification for deviating from the required procedures at the place of arrest and missing details in transferring the evidence created reasonable doubt. The stipulations entered into with the witnesses were also insufficient to fulfill the burden of proof to show the Chain of Custody and ensure that the item was preserved properly.
