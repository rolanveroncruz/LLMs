**Case:** *Alcazar v. Alcazar*, G.R. No. 174451, October 13, 2009.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the RTC's dismissal of Veronica Alcazar's complaint seeking annulment of her marriage to Rey Alcazar. The original complaint was based on physical incapacity to consummate the marriage (Art. 45(5) of the Family Code), but the evidence showed consummation. The Court considered, *arguendo*, the complaint as one for declaration of nullity under Art. 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity), but still dismissed it.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 45(5) of the Family Code:** Annulment based on physical incapacity to consummate marriage.  This was the basis of the initial claim but evidence of intercourse existed, so the court dismissed it.
*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** Declaration of nullity based on psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations. This was the crux of the appeal.
*   **Essential Marital Obligations (Articles 68-71 & 220, 221, 225, Family Code):** Love, trust, respect, fidelity, cohabitation, mutual help & support; parental duties. Non-compliance must be stated, proven, and included in the decision.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Rests on the plaintiff (petitioner) to prove the nullity of the marriage. Doubts are resolved in favor of the marriage's validity.

**Liabilities:**

*   None directly applicable in the case. The main issue is whether Rey Alcazar's behavior constitutes psychological incapacity.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misinterpretation of Art. 36, Family Code:** The Court reiterates that psychological incapacity isn't a catch-all for marital dissatisfaction or incompatibility. *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (310 Phil. 21) defines it as a mental incapacity rendering a party "truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants."
*   **Expert Testimony:** The psychologist's report (Nedy Tayag) was deemed insufficient. The Court highlighted the importance of expert testimony (psychiatrist or psychologist) to medically or clinically identify the root cause of the incapacity, and to show how it renders the party unable to fulfill marital obligations. A personal evaluation of the defendant is crucial. In this case, the expert relied solely on the petitioner, resulting in a lack of objectivity.
*   **Juridical Antecedence & Incurability:** The Court emphasized that the psychological incapacity must have existed at the time of the marriage and be permanent or incurable. The report failed to establish this.
*   **Petitioner's claim of abandonment/infidelity:** The Court noted that these, *per se*, are not grounds for Art. 36 unless they are manifestations of a disordered personality rendering a spouse unable to discharge marital obligations.
*   **Mistakes of Counsel:** The Court stated the client is bound by the mistakes of counsel, but that such is not a hard and fast rule.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Articles 36, 45(5), 68-71, 220, 221, 225**
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals, 310 Phil. 21 (1995):** Established the definition and requirements for psychological incapacity under Art. 36.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, 335 Phil. 664 (1997):** Laid down guidelines for resolving Art. 36 petitions, including the burden of proof and the need for clinical identification of the incapacity.
*   **Marcos v. Marcos, 397 Phil. 840 (2000):** Emphasized that Art. 36 is not a divorce law, but pertains to a serious pre-existing psychological illness.
*   **Tan Hang v. Paredes, 241 Phil. 740 (1988):** Established the client is bound by the mistakes of counsel.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Art. 36 remains contentious, with courts frequently emphasizing that it is not a "blanket" provision for dissolving unhappy marriages. The specific requirements of gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability are strictly construed. The reliance on expert testimony is critical, and its quality heavily scrutinized.

**Conclusion:** The Petitioner's case failed because the evidence did not sufficiently establish that the Respondent was psychologically incapacitated at the time of the marriage, and that any alleged psychological disorder was grave, incurable, and prevented him from fulfilling his essential marital obligations as defined by the Family Code.
