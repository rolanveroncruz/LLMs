## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Julian Santiago, Sr. and Leonila Santiago and Spouses Lim Jose Ong and Mimi Ong Lim vs. Bank of the Philippine Islands*, G.R. No. 163749

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's decision upholding the RTC's dismissal of an injunction, damages, and accounting complaint.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Julian Santiago, Sr. and Leonila Santiago (original owners of mortgaged properties) and Spouses Lim Jose Ong and Mimi Ong Lim (titleholders and mortgagors to FEBTC).
*   **Respondent:** Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), as successor in interest to Far East Bank & Trust Co. (FEBTC), later substituted by Investments 2234 Philippines Fund I (SPV-AMC), Inc.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Santiago mortgaged land to Spouses Deloria.
*   FEBTC approved a loan for Spouses Lim to purchase the land from Spouses Santiago, with proceeds to release the Deloria mortgage.
*   Spouses Santiago sold the land to Spouses Lim.
*   Spouses Lim mortgaged the land to FEBTC to secure a P2.5M loan, also securing future advances and obligations, including those of Marichris Development Corporation (MDC), where Lim was an officer.
*   Spouses Lim defaulted; BPI (as successor to FEBTC) initiated extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   Spouses Santiago and Spouses Lim filed suit for injunction, damages, and accounting, claiming Spouses Santiago were the real borrowers, Spouses Lim were merely accomodating, and alleged payments.
*   RTC dismissed the complaint due to improper service of summons on BPI's branch managers, not on persons specified in Rule 14, Section 11.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Spouses Lim's obligation to repay loan secured by the land. Includes dragnet clause.
*   **Loan Agreement:** Conditions for loan, including use of proceeds to purchase land and release Deloria mortgage.
*   **Accommodation Agreement (Alleged):** Spouses Santiago's claim that Spouses Lim acted as an accomodating party.
*   **Rule 14, Section 11, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Proper service of summons on domestic juridical entity.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Lim:** Liability for loan default, potentially triggering foreclosure and deficiency judgment.
*   **Spouses Santiago:** Potential liability if the court recognizes them as the true borrowers.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Foreclosure:** Loss of land due to Spouses Lim's default.
*   **Judgment against Spouses Santiago:** If determined to be the true borrowers, they could be held liable for the outstanding debt.
*   **Invalid Service of Summons:** Dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction, preventing determination of the merits.
*   **Dragnet Clause Enforcement:** BPI might attempt to include MDC's debts in the foreclosure.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Section 11, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Crucial statutory reference regarding proper service of summons on domestic corporations.
*   **_E.B. Villarosa & Partner Co., Ltd v. Benito_, G.R. No. 136426:** Strict compliance with Rule 14, Section 11 is required. Overrules prior jurisprudence permitting substantial compliance.
*   **_Mason v. Court of Appeals_, G.R. No. 144662:** Reaffirms the strict construction of Rule 14, Section 11.
*   **_Bank of Philippine Islands v. Santiago_, G.R. No. 169116:** Service on a BPI branch manager is insufficient to bind the corporation.
*   **Section 4 and 5, Rule 15, Rules of Court:** Three-day notice rule for motions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dragnet Clause in Mortgage:** Could be interpreted broadly to include debts beyond the intended scope, potentially including MDC's obligations.
*   **Accommodation Agreement:** Validity and enforceability of the alleged accommodation agreement between Spouses Santiago and Spouses Lim, given lack of formal documentation.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision. The service of summons on the branch managers was invalid, and, therefore, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of BPI. The Supreme Court also found that the motion to dismiss was proper even though the three-day notice rule was not observed.
