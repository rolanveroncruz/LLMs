**Legal Document Summary: *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mindanao I Geothermal Partnership***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 192006, November 14, 2018 (843 Phil. 163)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court on a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) en banc decision regarding a claim for the issuance of a Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) for unutilized excess input Value-Added Tax (VAT).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **VAT Zero-Rating:**  Mindanao I Geothermal Partnership (M1) is a VAT-registered entity engaged in geothermal power generation. M1 claimed VAT zero-rating on its sales to PNOC-EDC based on RA 9136 (EPIRA).
*   **Claim for Tax Credit Certificate:** M1 filed an administrative claim with the BIR for a TCC for unutilized excess input VAT, followed by a Petition for Review with the CTA after alleged inaction by the BIR.
*   **120+30 Day Rule:** The central issue is the timeliness of M1's judicial claim for a TCC under Section 112(C) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), which requires taxpayers to appeal to the CTA within 30 days after the 120-day period for the BIR to act on the administrative claim.
*   **Judicial Notice:** Propriety of the CTA's taking judicial notice of M1's VAT returns filed in other pending cases.
*   **Motion for New Trial:** The propriety of the CTA granting M1's motion for a new trial to submit Certificates of Creditable Tax Withheld at Source and machine-validated Monthly VAT Declarations.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **M1's Obligation:** To file administrative and judicial claims for VAT refund within the periods prescribed by Section 112 of the NIRC.
*   **CIR's Duty:** To act on VAT refund claims within the 120-day period. However, non-action does not remove the taxpayer's obligation to appeal to the CTA within 30 days.

**Key Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 112 of the NIRC:** The core statutory provision governing VAT refunds and tax credits, especially the 120+30 day rule in subsection (D).
*   **RA 9136 (EPIRA):**  Basis for M1's claim of VAT zero-rating on electric power sales.
*   ***CIR v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.* (646 Phil. 710 (2010)):**  The Supreme Court case that firmly established the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120+30-day period in Section 112(C).
*   ***CIR v. San Roque Power Corp.* (703 Phil. 310 (2013)):**  Reiterated *Aichi* and addressed the retroactive application of the 120+30 day rule.
*   ***Atlas Consolidated Mining and Dev't. Corp. v. CIR* (551 Phil. 519 (2007)) and *CIR v. Mirant Pagbilao Corp.* (586 Phil. 712 (2008)):** Supreme Court cases which interpreted Section 112.
*   ***Silicon Philippines, Inc. v. CIR* (757 Phil. 54 (2015)):** The Supreme Court held in this case that a tax refund for the second quarter of 2000 should have been dismissed for having been filed out of time since it was not filed within 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 9, Section 1:** Provides that when it appears from the pleadings or the evidence on record that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the claim.
*   ***Tijam, et al. v. Sibonghanoy, et al.* (131 Phil. 556 (1968)):** The Supreme Court enumerated the principle of "jurisdiction by estoppel" as an exception to the general rule that lack of jurisdiction affects the very authority of the court to take cognizance of and to render judgment on the action.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of *Aichi*:** M1 argued against the retroactive application of *Aichi*, claiming it relied on pre-*Aichi* interpretations. The Court rejected this argument, citing *San Roque*.
*   **Jurisdiction by Estoppel:** M1 argued that the BIR was estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction.  The Court rejected this argument, finding no basis for equitable estoppel.
*   **Timeliness of Judicial Claim:** The core risk is the untimeliness of M1's judicial claim.  The Court ruled that M1 filed its Petition for Review with the CTA 333 days after the lapse of the 120-day period.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the word "may" in Section 112(C) of the NIRC, particularly whether it refers to the option to appeal or the period within which to appeal. This ambiguity was resolved by *Aichi*.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the CIR's petition, *REVERSED* the CTA en banc decision, and *DISMISSED* M1's judicial claim for refund due to being filed *out of time*. The Court held that the CTA lacked jurisdiction to entertain the claim.
