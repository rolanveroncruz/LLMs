Here's a legal summary of *National Housing Authority vs. Heirs of Isidro Guivelondo*, G.R. No. 166518, June 16, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

This case involves the National Housing Authority's (NHA) challenge to a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order (1) granting an alias writ of execution for a deficiency in the original just compensation payment and (2) ordering NHA to pay interest on the delayed just compensation payment to the Heirs of Guivelondo (Respondents) in an expropriation case.  The Supreme Court (SC) denied NHA's petition, upholding the CA.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Finality of Expropriation:** SC reiterated that the original expropriation order was valid and final, as established in G.R. No. 154411. However, the Court ruled that a trial court retains jurisdiction to enforce its judgment, even after it has become final.

*   **Alias Writ of Execution:** The SC affirmed the issuance of an alias writ of execution to cover a PHP 70,300.00 deficiency reported by the sheriff. SC held that the writ of execution must conform to the judgment, and an alias writ is proper to rectify deficiencies.

*   **Interest on Just Compensation:**  The SC upheld the imposition of 12% per annum interest on the unpaid just compensation. The Court distinguished *Urtula v. Republic*, explaining that the interest here was *not* interest as part of the expropriation judgment (which would need to be explicitly stated) but rather legal interest due to *delay* in satisfying the money judgment *after* it became final and executory. This delay was considered forbearance of credit and legal interest applied.
    * It is important to note that the interest was computed from the finality of the judgment, not the taking of the property.

*   **Jurisdiction of RTC Branch 19:** The SC rejected NHA's argument that RTC Branch 19 lacked jurisdiction. NHA had initiated the motion for inhibition that resulted in the re-raffle to Branch 19. Therefore, NHA was estopped from challenging the court's jurisdiction.

**Obligations of NHA:**

*   Pay the remaining PHP 70,300.00 deficiency as per the alias writ of execution.
*   Pay legal interest of 12% per annum on PHP 80,299,206.72 (the unsatisfied portion of the just compensation) for 32 months of delay.
*   Pay legal interest of 12% per annum on the PHP 25,695,746.15 in unpaid interest from the date the RTC's 5-day payment period expired until it is paid.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   Continued accrual of interest at 12% per annum on both the deficiency and the original interest amount until fully paid.
*   Enforcement actions if NHA fails to comply with the court's orders.
*   Potential for similar rulings in other expropriation cases involving NHA, especially concerning delays in payment.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **G.R. No. 154411 (Prior Ruling):** Established the validity of the expropriation order.
*   **Urtula v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. L-22061, January 31, 1968:** Distinguished regarding the nature of interest.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 146587, July 2, 2002:** Cited for the rule on computing legal interest due to forbearance of credit.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994:** Cited for computing interest from the time the judgment becomes final and executory.
*   **Rule 67, Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Directed the defendant in an expropriation case to "present in a single motion to dismiss or for other appropriate relief, all of his objections and defenses . . ." and if not so presented "are waived.".

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention was the issue of interest. The NHA asserted that the order was silent on the payment of interest to respondents. However, the Court clarified that the silence in the judgment did not preclude the imposition of legal interest due to NHA's delay.
* The date of the start of interest calculation as it was not addressed in the main expropriation decision.

**Legal Advice:**

Advise NHA to:

1.  Immediately comply with the SC decision to minimize further interest accrual.
2.  Conduct a thorough review of all pending and future expropriation cases to proactively manage potential liabilities related to interest on delayed payments.
3.  Ensure timely and complete payment of just compensation to avoid similar claims of delay and the resulting legal and financial consequences.
