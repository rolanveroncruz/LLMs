## Legal Document Summary: People v. CCC (G.R. No. 220492)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of CCC for three counts of rape against his daughter, AAA. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction but modified the number of counts to two.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** CCC was charged in two separate informations for rape committed in January 2011 and September 2011.
*   **Victim Testimony:** AAA testified to three instances of rape. Her testimony was considered credible by the RTC and CA.
*   **Defense:** CCC raised denial and alibi, claiming he wouldn't do such a thing and was rarely home. This was rejected by the lower courts.
*   **Moral Ascendancy:** The SC reiterated that in incestuous rape cases, especially with a minor victim, the father's moral ascendancy substitutes for force or intimidation.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua without eligibility of parole was imposed for each count.

**Obligations:**

*   CCC is obligated to serve reclusion perpetua for each of the two counts of rape.
*   CCC is obligated to pay AAA P75,000 as civil indemnity, P75,000 as moral damages, and P75,000 as exemplary damages for each count of rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   CCC is criminally liable for two counts of rape under Article 266-A and penalized by 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended).
*   CCC is civilly liable for damages suffered by AAA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenges to Credibility:**  While the SC affirmed the lower courts' assessment of AAA's credibility, future petitions for review might raise challenges based on potential inconsistencies or issues with her testimony, although this is unlikely given the affirming decisions.
*   **Petition for Clemency:** While parole is not an option, a future petition for executive clemency might be explored.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **R.A. No. 7610:** An Act Providing for Stronger Deterrence and Special Protection Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination
*   **R.A. No. 9262:** An Act Defining Violence Against Women and Their Children, Providing for Protective Measures for Victims, Prescribing Penalties Therefore, and for Other Purposes
*   **People v. Barcela, 652 Phil. 134 (2010):**  Cited regarding moral and physical domination in incestuous rape cases.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Cited regarding the amount of exemplary damages for rape when reclusion perpetua is imposed.
*   **People v. Bentayo, G.R. No. 216938, 5 June 2017:** Moral ascendency replaces violence and intimidation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial conviction for *three* counts of rape despite only *two* informations was a point of contention addressed by the SC.  The RTC incorrectly assumed that multiple acts of rape proved at trial justified convictions beyond the filed charges. This was corrected on appeal.

**Concise Legal Precision:**

The SC affirmed CCC's conviction for two counts of rape, upholding the lower courts' finding of the victim's credible testimony and emphasizing the substitution of moral ascendancy for force/intimidation in incestuous rape. The penalty is reclusion perpetua per count, with associated damages. The discrepancy between the number of convictions and the number of informations was resolved, limiting the conviction to two counts.
