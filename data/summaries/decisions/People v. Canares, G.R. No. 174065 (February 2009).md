## Legal Document Summary: People v. Canares, G.R. No. 174065

**Case Summary:** This is a review of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Rolly Canares for statutory rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed sometime between 1992-1995. The victim (AAA) was 9 years old at the time of the initial rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Statutory Rape (Art. 335 RPC):** Carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age, irrespective of consent. Force, intimidation, or lack of consent are not elements.
*   **Elements of Statutory Rape:** (1) Age of complainant (under 12), (2) Identity of accused, (3) Carnal knowledge.
*   **Sufficiency of Information (Rule 110, Sections 6 & 11, Rules of Criminal Procedure):** Precise date of offense not required unless date is a material element.
*   **Civil Code Arts. 2229 and 2230: Award of Exemplary Damages to set a public example and serve as deterrent against elders who abuse and corrupt the youth.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused (Canares): To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for statutory rape.
*   Civil liability:
    *   Civil indemnity:  (Awarded because rape was committed).
    *   Moral damages: (Awarded on the assumption that rape complainants suffer injuries).
    *   Exemplary Damages: (Justified because of abuse to youth.)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defective Information Argument:**  Accused argued the information was defective for failing to specify the exact date of the rape.
    *   **Court's Ruling:**  Rejected the argument, citing *People v. Bugayong* (G.R. No. 126518, December 2, 1998), *People v. Rafon* (G.R. No. 169059, September 5, 2007), and *People v. Lizada* (G.R. Nos. 143468-71, January 24, 2003), which establish that the precise date is not an essential element of rape unless the date of commission is a material element of the offense. The allegation of "sometime between 1992 to 1995" was deemed sufficient, especially coupled with the victim's testimony pinpointing 1992. The date of commission, thus, cured the perceived vagueness. Additionally, the argument was waived for failure to raise it before arraignment.
    *   **Case Law on defective Information:** *People v. Gianan,* G.R. Nos. 135288-93, September 15, 2000.
*   **Defense of Denial:** Accused denied the accusations. This was deemed a weak defense given the positive and credible testimony of the victim.
*   **Alibi of Residence:** Accused claimed the victim did not live at her grandmother's during the period.  This was contradicted by the victim's testimony.
*   **Imputation of Ill Motives:** Accused claimed the charges were for monetary reasons. This was deemed unsubstantiated and contrary to human experience.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 7610 (Child Abuse Law)
*   Republic Act No. 9262 (Violence Against Women and Their Children Act)
*   Revised Penal Code (Article 335) - Rape Provisions

**Ambiguities:**

*   Although the Information mentioned a period of 1992-1995, the conviction specifically focused on the incident in 1992 when the victim was 9 years old.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The Court emphasized the credibility of the victim's testimony, especially in cases of statutory rape.
*   Defective Information that fails to include the date of occurence would be accepted if the victim could prove that the incident occurred through evidence presented during the trial.
*   The defense of denial and unsubstantiated allegations of ill motive were insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence.
*   Court upheld the awards of civil indemnity and moral damages.
