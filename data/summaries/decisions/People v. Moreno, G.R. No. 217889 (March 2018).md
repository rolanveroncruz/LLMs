## Legal Document Summary: People v. Moreno, G.R. No. 217889

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC conviction of Ritz Baring Moreno for Murder. The Supreme Court reviewed the CA's decision.

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant (Moreno) shot and killed Kyle Kales Capsa. Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony (Reanne Capsa, the victim's brother) and Moreno's extrajudicial confession. Moreno claimed he was instructed to shoot the victim by a third party, Tyke, after Tyke and the victim had quarrelled.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** SC affirmed the lower courts' finding that Reanne Capsa's eyewitness testimony identifying Moreno as the shooter was credible.
*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** Moreno's sworn statement admitting to the shooting was admitted in evidence.
*   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court overturned the lower courts' finding of treachery. The court held that there was not enough evidence that the attack was premeditated or consciously adopted to ensure its success, citing the fact that Moreno borrowed the gun immediately before the shooting and acted on the spur of the moment after Tyke's instruction. Unexpectedness alone is insufficient to establish treachery. *[See Escamilla v. People, 705 Phil. 188 (2013)]*
*   **Evident Premeditation:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding that evident premeditation was not proven. Prosecution failed to show lapse of time for accused to contemplate on the crime.
*   **Reclassification of Crime:** Due to the absence of treachery and evident premeditation, the SC reclassified the crime from Murder (Art. 248, RPC) to Homicide (Art. 249, RPC). *[See Ramos v. People, G.R. No. 218466, 23 January 2017]*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Original Murder Conviction (Reversed):** The original conviction for Murder carried a penalty of *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Homicide Conviction:**  The SC found Moreno guilty of Homicide (Art. 249, RPC), punishable by *Reclusion Temporal*.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance:** Voluntary surrender was properly appreciated as a mitigating circumstance.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied to the penalty, resulting in a sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* (minimum) to 14 years of *reclusion temporal* (maximum).
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Moreno is obligated to pay the victim's heirs:
    *   P50,000.00 as civil indemnity *ex delicto*
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages
    *   P50,000.00 as temperate damages
    *   6% interest per annum on all monetary awards from finality of decision until fully paid.  *[See Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267 (2013) and People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806(2016)]*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Reliability of eyewitness testimony can always be challenged, particularly concerning identification under stressful conditions. However, this issue was resolved in this case.
*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** Challenges to the voluntariness of the extrajudicial confession could have been made, but were not successful in this case due to the presence of counsel during the statement and express admission. *[See People v. Buenafe, G.R. No. 212930, 3 August 2016]*
