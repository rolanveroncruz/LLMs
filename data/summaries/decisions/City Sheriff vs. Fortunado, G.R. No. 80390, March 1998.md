## Legal Document Summary: *City Sheriff, Iligan City v. Alfaro Fortunado* G.R. No. 80390, March 27, 1998

**Nature of the Document:** This is a decision by the Supreme Court of the Philippines reviewing a case involving a real estate mortgage, its attempted foreclosure, and subsequent release.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over the attempted foreclosure of mortgaged properties (TCT No. T-3041 and T-1929) by Angel Bautista, assignee of Traders Royal Bank (TRB). The properties were originally mortgaged to TRB by Arsenio Lopez, Jr.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Respondents (Fortunados) initially filed a case against Lopez and TRB for annulment of the mortgage. TRB counterclaimed for foreclosure.
    *   The trial court initially declared the mortgage void, but this was reversed by the Court of Appeals.
    *   TRB assigned its rights to Bautista.
    *   Bautista sought foreclosure.
    *   Respondents filed a complaint for cancellation of lien and preliminary injunction.
    *   Trial court initially dismissed the complaint via summary judgment, then reversed itself on reconsideration, permanently enjoining the foreclosure and ordering cancellation of the lien.
    *   The CA forwarded the appeal to the Supreme Court due to perceived questions of law.
*   **Key Argument of Respondents:** The underlying loan secured by the mortgage had been paid, therefore the mortgage (being accessory) was extinguished.
*   **Mootness:** The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition because TRB had already released the real estate mortgage before the petition reached the Supreme Court.
*   **Attorney Misconduct:** The Court reprimanded petitioner's counsel, Atty. Emilio Abrogena, for failing to inform the court of the petitioner's death, a duty mandated by Section 16, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. The court also noted his failure to update his address.

**Obligations:**

*   The Court reminded lawyers of their obligation under Section 16, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court to notify the court of a client's death.
*   Atty. Abrogena has a continuing obligation as an officer of the court to inform the court of his change of address

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Abrogena was reprimanded for his failure to inform the court of the petitioner's death and for his unprofessional conduct.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Dismissal due to Mootness:** The case highlights the risk of a case becoming moot if underlying facts change (e.g., debt paid, mortgage released) during litigation.
*   **Attorney Discipline:**  The decision emphasizes the potential disciplinary consequences for attorneys who fail to meet their obligations to the court, including failure to notify the court of a client's death or change of address.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 16, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Deals with the duty of counsel upon the death of a party.
*   **Bongal vs. Bureau of Labor Relations, 136 SCRA 225 cited in Lomo vs. Mabelin, 146 SCRA 477:** Principles on mootness.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The initial conflicting decisions of the trial court highlight potential issues regarding the application of summary judgment and the assessment of factual evidence related to payment of the underlying loan.

**Overall Legal Significance:**

*   The decision underscores the importance of attorneys diligently fulfilling their duties as officers of the court. It serves as a reminder to inform the court of the death of a client and to maintain updated contact information. This case also highlights the principle that courts should not resolve issues that have become moot and academic.
