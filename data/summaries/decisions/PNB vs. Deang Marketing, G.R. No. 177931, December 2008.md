## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Deang Marketing Corporation

**Case:** G.R. No. 177931, December 8, 2008 (593 Phil. 703)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Philippine National Bank (PNB)
*   **Respondents:** Deang Marketing Corporation and Berlita Deang

**Nature of Action:** Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals' decision that declared PNB in default and expunged its Answer. The CA reversed the RTC's orders granting PNB an extension of time to file its Answer.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Reformation of Contract and Specific Performance:** Deang Marketing filed a complaint seeking reformation of a contract and specific performance, alleging that a *dacion en pago* arrangement in a Consolidation and Restructuring Agreement transformed their loan into a term loan. PNB contests the dacion en pago.
2.  **Default Due to Late Filing:** The central issue is whether the CA erred in declaring PNB in default for filing its Motion for Extension of Time and its Answer late.
    *   PNB filed its Motion for Extension *after* the initial 15-day period for filing an Answer had expired (Rule 11, Sec. 2).
    *   PNB's claim of receipt of the summons (April 24) contradicted the Process Server's return (April 20).
    *   PNB miscalculated the extension period, requesting until June 11 when it should have been June 8 (or June 4)
    *   PNB utilized an unapproved method of service (private courier LBC) without explanation (Rule 13, Secs. 3, 5 & 7).
    *   PNB counsel notarized the Verification and Corporate Secretary’s Certificate on behalf of the respondents’ lawsuit against PNB

**Court Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* PNB's petition, upholding the CA's declaration of default.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PNB:** Found to be in default for failure to timely file its responsive pleading and for procedural deficiencies. Subject to the consequences of a default judgment, although not automatically entitled to an adverse judgment. PNB must bear the responsibility for their actions.
*   **Deang Marketing:** Obligated to prove their claim for reformation of contract and specific performance through evidence, even with PNB in default.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Risk of Default Judgment:** PNB faces the risk of an unfavorable judgment based solely on Deang Marketing's evidence.
*   **Interpretation of Consolidation and Restructuring Agreement:** The core dispute involves the interpretation of the agreement, specifically whether it encompassed a *dacion en pago*.
*   **Ambiguity in Motion to Declare Default:** The lack of candor in PNB’s representations regarding the Motion for Extension may expose them to further scrutiny and potential sanctions.
