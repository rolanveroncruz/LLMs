**Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Development Resources Corporation (G.R. No. 180218, December 18, 2009)**

**Nature:**  Action for cancellation of Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) and reversion of land to the public domain.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines (represented by the Solicitor General)
*   **Respondent:** Development Resources Corporation (DRC), represented by Carlos Chua, and the Register of Deeds of Davao City

**Facts:** The Republic seeks to revert Lots 1 and 5 of Pcs-16678 (derived from Lot 544, Cad-102) back to the public domain, arguing the original adjudication of Lot 544 to Antonio Matute in 1922 was invalid because the land was still inalienable public forest at that time. The Republic relies primarily on Land Classification (LC) Map 47, which bears a certification date of August 6, 1923, as evidence.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Republic's Argument:** Lot 544 was inalienable public forest on October 14, 1922 (date of original adjudication). LC Map 47, certified August 6, 1923, proves that the land only became alienable after the adjudication.
*   **DRC's Argument:** They are purchasers in good faith; the land can no longer be reverted.

**Court's Holding:**  The Supreme Court denied the Republic's petition, affirming the lower courts' dismissal of the reversion suit.

**Key Legal Issues & Reasoning:**

*   **Probative Value of LC Map 47:** The Court held the Republic failed to meet its burden of proof. The LC Map 47 presented was a mere electronic reproduction, not an original or certified true copy. This is inadmissible as per *SAAD Agro-Industries, Inc. v. Republic of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 152570). *Sta. Monica Industrial and Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 83290) is relevant here.
*   **Interpretation of LC Map 47:** Even if admissible, LC Map 47 doesn't explicitly state that the land was *not* alienable *before* August 6, 1923. The certification date doesn't necessarily imply the land's status before that date.
*   **Burden of Proof in Reversion Cases:** The State bears a heavy burden of proving the grounds for reversion, which it failed to do here.
*   **Good Faith Purchasers:** While raised by DRC, the Court's decision rested primarily on the Republic's failure to prove the land's status at the time of original adjudication, making the good faith purchaser argument somewhat moot.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Evidence (admissibility of documents, especially public records)
*   Public Land Act (implication of alienable and disposable lands and their use)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Definitive Evidence:** The case highlights the importance of presenting proper, certified documentation in land disputes, particularly in reversion cases.
*   **Ambiguity in LC Maps:** The court highlights the requirement that an LC Map must be conclusive about the classification of land at the exact time relevant to the case. 
*   **Cadastral Proceedings:** This case involved land originally part of a cadastral survey, which was initiated by the government itself to have legitimate possessors register their land. The fact that the government is now trying to reclaim the same land raises concerns.

**Conclusion:** The case reinforces the high burden of proof on the State in reversion cases and emphasizes the need for conclusive evidence of the land's classification at the relevant historical time. It also highlights the limitations of relying on certification dates alone. The court is unwilling to allow the government to overturn titles unless it can provide hard evidence of the nature of the land at the time it was adjudicated to the original owner.
