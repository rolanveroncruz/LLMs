## Legal Document Summary: Enriquez vs. BPI (G.R. No. 172812, February 12, 2008)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision, which affirmed the NLRC's dismissal of an illegal dismissal complaint.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Amelia R. Enriquez and Remo Sia (former branch manager and assistant branch manager, respectively, of BPI-Bacolod Singcang Branch).
*   **Respondents:** Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) and Luis A. Puentevella (AVP, impleaded in his personal capacity).

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of Petitioners by BPI was illegal.  The central factual dispute revolves around an alleged cover-up of a teller's cash shortage.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court **denied** the petition, upholding the CA and NLRC decisions that the dismissal was for just cause (breach of trust and confidence; dishonesty).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **BPI Personnel Policy (Chapter IV, Section 20(B)):** Outlines grounds for dismissal, specifically:
    *   Breach of trust and confidence; dishonesty (misappropriation, malversation, or withholding of funds): 1st offense - dismissal.
    *   Violation of operating procedures (willful non-observance for personal gain): 1st offense - dismissal.
    *   Aiding, abetting, or concealing irregular/fraudulent acts against BPI: Considered equally guilty as principal perpetrator and dealt with accordingly.
    *   Management will not tolerate violations of banking/established procedures where there is a conflict-of-interest situation and the transaction benefits the officer or related interest at BPI's expense or risk.

**Liabilities & Remedies Sought (by Petitioners, unsuccessfully):**

*   Reinstatement (or separation pay in lieu thereof)
*   Backwages, allowances, and benefits
*   Retirement pay
*   Attorney's fees
*   Moral and exemplary damages (P10,000,000.00)

**Reasoning and Potential Risks:**

*   **Just Cause for Dismissal:** The Court found that petitioners, as branch manager and assistant branch manager, occupied positions of trust and confidence. Their failure to report the teller's cash shortage and alleged participation in the cover-up constituted a breach of this trust, providing just cause for dismissal under Article 297 [formerly 282] of the Labor Code. The failure to report, even if done in good faith, was still a justification for the loss of trust. *Villanueva v. NLRC (Third Division)* establishes the requirement that breach must be related to performance of function. This requirement was met in the present case. *De La Cruz v. NLRC* dictates the importance of the positions as managerial employees.
*   **Teller Fregil's Retraction:** While retractions are generally viewed with disfavor, the Court gave credence to Teller Fregil's retraction letter and subsequent affidavits, bolstered by the independent audit findings. This presents a potential risk, as retractions are often viewed with suspicion in legal proceedings.
*   **Verification Issue:** The Court applied a liberal interpretation of the NLRC Rules of Procedure regarding verification of the appeal filed by BPI, citing *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals* and  *People's Aircargo and Warehousing Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* to emphasize substantial compliance and discourage dismissing cases on purely procedural grounds when substantial justice is at stake.
*   **Banking Industry Standard:** The Court emphasized the high degree of trust and confidence required in the banking industry due to its public interest nature, citing *Villanueva v. Citytrust Banking Corporation*.  The failure of senior managerial employees to uphold these standards was deemed sufficient to justify dismissal.
*   **Long Tenure:** The Court held that the petitioners' long tenure with BPI was, if anything, an aggravating factor given their betrayal of trust.  This directly contradicts the potential mitigating effect of long service often considered in labor disputes. *Salvador v. Philippine Mining Service Corporation* supported this reasoning.
*   **Alleged Anomaly:**  The claim of irregularity in the NLRC's handling of the appeal was dismissed as mere allegation pending investigation by the Ombudsman.
*   **Employee Obligations:** Employees also have obligation to respect employer rights *So Sosito v. Aguinaldo Development Corporation*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious area is the conflicting narratives surrounding the teller's shortage and alleged cover-up. The assessment of credibility of witnesses (particularly Teller Fregil's retraction) was critical in the Court's decision.
*   The extent to which "aiding, abetting, or concealing" requires intent to benefit personally or intent to cause harm to the bank could be seen as ambiguous, although the Court implicitly interpreted it broadly in this case.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Article 297 [formerly 282]):** Just causes for termination of employment.
*   **NLRC Rules of Procedure (Rule VI, Section 4):** Requirements for perfection of appeal.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 7 Section 4):** Verification Requirements
*   **Corporation Code (Section 23):**
*   **People's Aircargo and Warehousing Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals (357 Phil. 850 (1998)):** Authority of corporation officer to bind the corporation.
*   **Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals (450 Phil. 532 (2003)):** Application for rules of procedure
*   **Villanueva v. NLRC (Third Division) (354 Phil. 1056, 1060):** Breach of trust and confidence
*   **Villanueva v. Citytrust Banking Corporation (413 Phil. 776, 785 (2001)):** Banking industry with public interest
*   **Salvador v. Philippine Mining Service Corporation (443 Phil. 878, 893 (2003)):** The effect of long service of employee on case
*   **So Sosito v. Aguinaldo Development Corporation (No. L-48926, 14 December 1987, 156 SCRA 392):** The obligations of employees.

**Conclusion:** This decision reinforces the high standards of conduct expected from employees in the banking industry, particularly those in managerial roles. It underscores the importance of transparency and adherence to internal policies, even in seemingly minor incidents. The case also demonstrates the Court's willingness to uphold employer prerogatives in dismissing employees for breach of trust when justified by substantial evidence, even when such employees have lengthy service records.
