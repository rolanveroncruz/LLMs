**Case Summary: Philippine Pizza, Inc. vs. Romeo Gregorio Oladive, Jr. et al.**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision finding grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA correctly determined that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the Labor Arbiter's finding of an employer-employee relationship between respondents (delivery riders) and petitioner Philippine Pizza, Inc. (PPI), and that Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc. (CBMI) was engaged in labor-only contracting.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision with modification.  The Court found that PPI and CBMI were engaged in labor-only contracting, making PPI the true employer. The respondents were illegally dismissed.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The Court held that CBMI, despite its capitalization and registration with the DOLE, was engaged in labor-only contracting, as defined under Article 106 of the Labor Code and Section 6 of Department Order No. 18-A (D.O. No. 18-A). The totality of circumstances demonstrated that the contracting arrangement was intended to circumvent labor laws and undermine the respondents' security of tenure (Sec. 7 D.O. 18-A).
*   **Control Test:**  While PPI argued that CBMI exercised control, the Court determined that PPI maintained significant control, establishing an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:**  The respondents' separation, ostensibly a manpower reduction (akin to retrenchment under Art. 298 of the Labor Code), was deemed illegal because PPI failed to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements for a valid retrenchment.
*   **Solidary Liability:**  Because CBMI was a labor-only contractor, it is solidarily liable with PPI for the respondents' monetary claims, consistent with Article 106 of the Labor Code and Section 27 of D.O. No. 18-A. *Valencia v. Classique Vinyl Products Corporation* was cited.
*   **Damages:**  The Court awarded each respondent full backwages from the date of illegal dismissal until actual reinstatement, moral damages (₱50,000), exemplary damages (₱50,000), and attorney's fees (10% of the total monetary award).  *Monsanto Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC* was referenced regarding oppressive labor practices.
*   **Interest:** Monetary awards are subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of the Decision until full payment, citing *Lara's Gifts & Decors Inc. v. Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc.*

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Philippine Pizza, Inc.:** Obligated to reinstate respondents to their former positions, pay full backwages, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees and is solidarily liable with CBMI.
*   **Consolidated Building Maintenance, Inc.:** Declared a labor-only contractor, CBMI is solidarily liable with PPI for the respondents' monetary claims.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** While the Court attempts to resolve factual discrepancies, the nature of determining employer-employee relationships is often highly fact-dependent, creating potential for future challenges regarding the exact calculation of backwages and implementation of reinstatement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 106, 294 (formerly 279), 298 (formerly 283).
