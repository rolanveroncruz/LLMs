## Legal Document Summary: People v. Gamo and Gabasan, G.R. No. 107799

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming conviction for Robbery with Homicide.

**Parties:**

*   Plaintiff-Appellee: People of the Philippines
*   Accused-Appellants: Sumina Gamo, Lumunsog Gabasan
*   Accused (at large): Pablito Nang

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Robbery with Homicide under Articles 293 and 294 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Facts:** Accused-Appellants Gamo and Gabasan, along with Pablito Nang, robbed the spouses Nicanor and Epifania Gonzales. During the robbery, Nicanor Gonzales was stabbed and killed.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Eyewitness testimony of Epifania Gonzales (wife) and Elizabeth Gonzales (daughter), positively identifying the accused.
    *   Post-mortem examination confirming the cause of death as hemorrhage due to stab wounds.
    *   Sketch of the crime scene.
*   **Defense:** Alibi – Accused-Appellants claimed they were at a different location attending a marriage covenant.
*   **Lower Court Ruling:** Conviction of Gamo and Gabasan for Robbery with Homicide, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* or life imprisonment, restitution of P500, and P50,000 indemnity.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellants:** Found guilty as principals in the crime of Robbery with Homicide, liable for:
    *   Serving *reclusion perpetua* (modified on appeal – see below).
    *   Restitution of P500 to the heirs of the victim.
    *   Indemnity of P50,000 to the heirs of the victim.
*   **State:** Obligation to apprehend Pablito Nang.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Witness Statements:** The defense highlighted minor inconsistencies between the witnesses' affidavits and testimonies. The court addressed this by referencing *People v. Miranda* and *People v. Reyes*, citing the inherent unreliability and incompleteness of affidavits compared to in-court testimony. The court did, however, acknowledge minor factual errors made by the trial court.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Weak alibi defense with no credible proof of physical impossibility. Distance between the alibi location and the crime scene was negotiable.
*   **Credibility of Child Witness:**  Questioning the credibility of Elizabeth Gonzales due to her age. The court upheld the Trial Courts discretion, stating that *any child can be a competent witness if they can perceive, and perceive, can make known their perception to others and that they are capable of relating truthfully facts for which they are examined.*
*   **Penalty Error:** The trial court erroneously imposed "reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment." The Supreme Court clarified that these are distinct penalties, citing *People v. Mobe* and *People v. Antonio Magana*, and modified the sentence by *DELETING* the phrase "or life imprisonment." Leaving just "*reclusion perpetua*."

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Articles 293 and 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Robbery with Homicide and its penalty.
*   **People v. Dismuke:** Established the principle of deference to trial court findings on witness credibility.
*   **People v. Miranda & People v. Reyes:** Addressed the issue of inconsistencies between affidavits and in-court testimonies.
*   **People v. Manzano, People v. Esquilona:** Addressed the issue of alibi.
*   **People v. Mendoza:** Deals with the competency of child witnesses
*   **People v. Mobe & People v. Antonio Magana:** Differentiates *reclusion perpetua* from life imprisonment.
*   **People v. Gavina:** Defines Robbery with Homicide elements.
*   **People v. Angeles & People v. Calegan & People v. Pugal:** Addresses liability of co-conspirators in Robbery with Homicide.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Sumina Gamo and Lumunsog Gabasan for Robbery with Homicide based on eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence. The Court addressed alleged inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, highlighting the superiority of in-court testimonies over affidavits. The defense of alibi was deemed weak. The Court clarified the distinction between *reclusion perpetua* and life imprisonment, modifying the lower court's sentence to solely *reclusion perpetua*. The case highlights the principle that co-conspirators are equally liable for the crime of Robbery with Homicide, even if they did not directly participate in the killing, unless they actively tried to prevent it. Furthermore, the court has an obligation to continue the search for the third co-conspirator, Pablito Nang, so that he may also face trial.
