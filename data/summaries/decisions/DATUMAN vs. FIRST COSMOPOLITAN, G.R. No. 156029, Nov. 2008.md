**Legal Document Summary: *Santosa B. Datuman vs. First Cosmopolitan Manpower and Promotion Services, Inc.*, G.R. No. 156029**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision reversing NLRC Decision regarding underpayment of salary and other claims.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Petitioner recruited as Saleslady in Bahrain with a monthly salary of US$370.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** Respondent agency is jointly and solidarily liable with foreign employer for claims arising from the contract (Section 1, Rule II, POEA Rules & Regulations).
*   **Statute of Limitations:** Art. 291 of the Labor Code dictates a 3-year prescriptive period for money claims.
*   **Prohibition against contract substitution:** Republic Act No. 8042 explicitly prohibits the substitution or alteration to the prejudice of the worker of employment contracts already approved and verified by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) from the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the period of the expiration of the same without the approval of the DOLE

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent Agency:** Duty to ensure the worker's actual job aligns with the POEA-approved contract. Cannot circumvent regulations by submitting false contracts for POEA approval. Must ensure faithful compliance with the employment contract's terms and conditions.
*   **Foreign Employer:** Obligated to adhere to terms of POEA-approved contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent Agency:** Solidary liability with foreign employer for underpayment of salary.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Contract Substitution:** The CA argues respondent's liability only extends to the initial contract, while the Supreme Court (SC) finds continued breaches through forced subsequent contracts.
*   **Prescription:** The CA ruled that the cause of action had prescribed because the claim was filed more than three years after the subsequent contract was signed. SC holds that prescriptive period for salary differentials accrues monthly, as salary falls due.
*   **Scope of Solidary Liability:** Extent of respondent's solidary liability in case of contract breaches beyond the initial POEA-approved contract.
*   The lower courts disagreed on the period to which the salary differences should be paid to the petitioner.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 291, Labor Code:** Sets 3-year limitation for money claims.
*   **Section 1, Rule II, POEA Rules & Regulations:** Establishes joint and solidary liability of agencies.
*   **Republic Act No. 8042:** Explicitly prohibits the substitution or alteration to the prejudice of the worker of employment contracts already approved and verified by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) from the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the period of the expiration of the same without the approval of the DOLE
*   ***Catan v. National Labor Relations Commission, 160 SCRA 691 (1988)*** responsibilities of the local agent and the foreign principal towards the contracted employees under the recruitment agreement extends up to and until the expiration of the employment contracts of the employees recruited and employed pursuant to the said recruitment agreement.
*   ***Placewell International Services Corporation v. Camote*** the subsequently executed side agreement of an overseas contract worker with her foreign employer which reduced his salary below the amount approved by the POEA is void because it is against our existing laws, morals and public policy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* Respondent agency admitted that it had entered into an illegal contract with complainant by proposing the position of a housemaid which said position was then not allowed by the POEA, by making it appear in the Employment Contract that the position being applied for is the position of a saleslady.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court upheld the principle of joint and solidary liability of recruitment agencies, emphasizing their duty to protect overseas workers. The CA's decision was reversed, and the NLRC decision was reinstated, affirming the petitioner's right to salary differentials, although with a corrected period for calculation of such differentials (May 31, 1992 to April 1993).
