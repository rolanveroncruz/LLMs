## Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-92-897 (Hermo v. Dela Rosa)

This administrative matter involves a complaint against Judge Rosalio G. dela Rosa for gross ignorance of the law and malfeasance, stemming from irregularities in SP Proc. No. 91-58645, a petition for naturalization filed by Juan G. Frivaldo.

**Key Provisions & Irregularities:**

*   **Premature Hearing:** Judge Dela Rosa reset the hearing date to an earlier date and the new order was not published, hearing the petition within six months of the last publication (violating Section 1 of R.A. No. 530).
*   **Premature Oath:** Frivaldo took his oath of allegiance on the same day the petition was granted, disregarding the two-year waiting period mandated by Section 1 of R.A. No. 530.
*   **Non-Publication in Official Gazette:** While the petition was published in a newspaper of general circulation, there is an apparent failure to publish in the Official Gazette as required by C.A. No. 473 (Revised Naturalization Law).
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Numerous violations of CA No. 63 as amended by CA No. 473

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Naturalization Law (C.A. No. 473):** Governs the process of naturalization. Publication and posting requirements outlined in Section 9.
*   **Republic Act No. 530:** Sets the six-month waiting period after publication before a naturalization petition can be heard and the two-year waiting period after judgment before the oath of allegiance can be administered (Sections 1 & 2).

**Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. De la Rosa, 232 SCRA 785 (1994):** The Supreme Court already ruled the naturalization proceedings in SP Proc. No. 91-58645 to be invalid due to procedural flaws, specifically related to publication and posting requirements. This serves as *res judicata* on the procedural irregularities.
*   **Republic v. Court of First Instance of Albay, 60 SCRA 195 (1974):** A decision in a petition for naturalization becomes final only after 30 days from its promulgation and, insofar as the Solicitor General is concerned, that period is counted from the date of his receipt of the copy of the decision.
*   **Po Yo Bi v. Republic, 205 SCRA 400 (1992):** Compliance with the publication requirement in the Official Gazette is jurisdictional.
*   **Sy v. Republic, 55 SCRA 724 (1974):** Publication and posting of the petition and order in its full text are jurisdictional requirements and absent thereof the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over the petition.

**Obligations:**

*   **Judge's Duty:** Respondent Judge had a clear duty to adhere to the statutory requirements for naturalization proceedings under C.A. No. 473 and R.A. No. 530. This included ensuring proper publication and adherence to the prescribed waiting periods.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Judge Dela Rosa was found liable for serious procedural lapses.
*   **Penalty:** He was fined P5,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Defect:** The failure to fully comply with the publication requirements (specifically, the potential non-publication in the Official Gazette) raises a fundamental question of whether the RTC ever acquired jurisdiction over the naturalization petition.
*   **Cover-Up Allegation:** While not explicitly adjudicated, the allegation of an attempted cover-up (Alma Catu's experience) suggests a potential element of bad faith.

**Conclusion:**

The document demonstrates clear violations of statutory requirements and established case law regarding naturalization proceedings. The premature hearing and oath, coupled with potential jurisdictional defects due to publication failures, provide a strong basis for the administrative sanction imposed on Judge Dela Rosa.
