## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Mardy Aquino, et al.*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Mardy Aquino, Mario Aquino, et al.* G.R. No. 203435, April 11, 2018 (829 Phil. 477)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Joint Decision finding Mardy Aquino, Mario Aquino, and Juanito Aquino guilty of murder and frustrated murder.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Charges:** Mardy Aquino, Mario Aquino, and others were charged with (1) Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC)) for the death of Jackie Caguioa and (2) Frustrated Murder (Art. 248 in relation to Art. 6, RPC) for injuries to Ernesto Caguioa.

*   **RTC Finding:** Guilty of both crimes. Reclusion Perpetua for Murder; indeterminate sentence for Frustrated Murder.

*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction, but modified the penalty for Frustrated Murder (increased minimum and maximum) and adjusted damages (reduced actual, increased civil indemnity, reduced moral).

*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** **Partially Granted** the appeal, downgrading the convictions:

    *   **Murder reduced to Homicide (Art. 249, RPC):** Absence of *abuse of superior strength* as a qualifying circumstance. Court held the prosecution failed to show the accused consciously sought the advantage. Established penalties and damages for Homicide applied.
    *   **Frustrated Murder reduced to Attempted Homicide:** Lack of proof that Ernesto's wounds were fatal absent medical intervention. Elements of Frustrated Homicide were not fully satisfied. Established penalties and damages for Attempted Homicide applied.
    *   **Accused-appellants were also ordered to pay Ernesto Caguioa P20,000.00 as exemplary damages because the abuse of superior strength was duly proved even though not alleged in the information**

*   **Evident Premeditation:** Was alleged in the information for frustrated murder but the court found that there was not even an attempt on the part of the prosecution to prove evident premeditation.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Mardy and Mario Aquino:** Found guilty of Homicide and Attempted Homicide. Subject to imprisonment terms and financial penalties as outlined in the decision.
*   **Financial Penalties:** Civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages awarded to the victims and their heirs. All monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.
*   **Outstanding Warrants:** The case remains archived for Recto Aquino, Inyong Narvante, Romy Fernandez, Felix Saplan and Bonifacio Caguioa, who remain at large, subject to future apprehension and trial.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sentencing Discretion:** The application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law leaves some room for interpretation regarding the specific length of imprisonment within the ranges provided.
*   **Damages:** The amounts awarded are subject to collection efforts.
*   **Unapprehended Co-Accused:** The potential apprehension and prosecution of the co-accused could lead to further legal proceedings and potentially impact the overall outcome.
*   **Superior Strength:** The court found the abuse of superior strength was duly proved but not alleged in the information, so it was the basis for the imposition of the exemplary damages award to Ernesto. This could be potentially contentious because there was no allegation of abuse of superior strength.

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 6, 51, 248, 249
