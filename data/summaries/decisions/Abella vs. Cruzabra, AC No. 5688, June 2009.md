**Case Summary: Abella v. Cruzabra, AC No. 5688**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Atty. Asteria E. Cruzabra for violation of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Section 7(b)(2) of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees) due to unauthorized engagement in private practice (notarial services) while serving as Deputy Register of Deeds.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 6713, Section 7(b)(2):** Prohibits public officials/employees from engaging in private practice unless authorized, and if such practice conflicts or tends to conflict with official functions.
*   **Memorandum Circular No. 17:** Requires written permission from the Department head for government employees to engage in private practice.
*   **Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Requires lawyers to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, and promote respect for law and legal processes.

**Key Facts:**

*   Respondent, a Deputy Register of Deeds, was commissioned as a notary public without obtaining written authorization from the Secretary of the DOJ.
*   Respondent notarized approximately 135 (disputed figure of 3,000) documents.
*   Respondent ceased notarial services after a reprimand from the Land Registration Authority.
*   The IBP initially dismissed the case for lack of merit but this ruling was overturned by the Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of RA 6713, Section 7(b)(2):** Engaging in private practice (notarial services) without proper authorization.
*   **Violation of Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Disregarding the legal requirement for authorization to practice law in the specific capacity of a notary.
*   The Court noted while it was argued it was a good faith error based on the instructions of a supervisor the respondent was not excused from this due to the fact the rule was already in place.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Superior's Authority:** Respondent's defense of relying on the Register of Deeds' alleged authorization was rejected as the Register of Deeds was not the proper authority.
*   **Good Faith Argument:** The Court did not accept the respondent's claim of good faith or ignorance of the law as exculpatory, citing the well-established principle that ignorance of the law excuses no one.
*   **Conflict of Interest:**  The court did not explicitly find a conflict of interest, though the complainant argued that acting as a notary public conflicted with the respondent's duties as Deputy Register of Deeds. However, the lack of authorization was the primary basis for liability.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Yumol, Jr. v. Ferrer Sr., A.C. No. 6585:** Emphasizes that private practice by government lawyers is not a matter of right and requires prior written request and approval with a duly approved leave of absence.  Cited to show the need for explicit authorization.
*   **Muring, Jr. v. Gatcho, A.M. No. CA-05-19-P:** Held that a court attorney was prohibited from engaging in notarial practice. Cited to show that the Court takes a hard line on notarial authority.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6713, Section 7(b)(2)**
*   **Memorandum Circular No. 17**
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 52, Rule IV**

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Cruzabra was found administratively liable for unauthorized engagement in the private practice of law while serving as a government employee, specifically for performing notarial services without the required written authorization from the Secretary of Justice. The court issued a reprimand, emphasizing the importance of adhering to statutory and regulatory requirements for legal practice, even in specific instances like notarial services. The case demonstrates the strict application of rules against unauthorized private practice by government lawyers and the limited weight given to claims of good faith or reliance on a superior's guidance.
