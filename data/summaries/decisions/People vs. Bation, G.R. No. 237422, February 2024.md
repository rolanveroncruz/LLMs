**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bation*, G.R. No. 237422 (February 14, 2024)**

**Case Overview:**
Accused-Appellant Ben G. Bation was convicted by the RTC and affirmed by the CA for violating Section 16, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) for illegal planting and cultivation of marijuana. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to a break in the chain of custody caused by failure to comply with the three-witness rule mandated by Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 16, Article II, RA 9165:** Criminalizes the planting, cultivating, or culture of plants classified as dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Pre-Amendment):** Outlines the procedure for custody and disposition of seized dangerous drugs, including the requirement of inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, representatives from the media and the DOJ, and an elected public official. This section also includes the chain of custody rule to ensure the integrity and identity of the seized items.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential Liability:** Bation faced life imprisonment and a PHP 6 million fine based on the lower courts' rulings.
*   **Risk Identified by SC:** Risk of wrongful arrest or evidence planting if the chain of custody requirements, including the three-witness rule, are not strictly followed.

**Key Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** The Supreme Court affirmed the legality of the warrantless arrest under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, as Bation was caught *in flagrante delicto*. The search and seizure of the marijuana plants prior to the arrest was deemed valid as the plants were located in an open area visible to passersby. SC also noted that the appellant could not argue against the unreasonable search, as he was neither the owner nor occupant of the property where the plants were discovered, citing *Stonehill v. Diokno*.
*   **Chain of Custody & Three-Witness Rule:** The critical issue was the non-compliance with the three-witness rule under Section 21 of RA 9165. Only a DOJ representative and two barangay officials were present during inventory, marking, and photography.
*   **Excuses for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution's explanation for the absence of a media representative (unanswered phone calls, distance of media outlet) was deemed insufficient. The Court reinforced that earnest efforts must be exerted, and substitution is not permitted. The saving clause in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 could not be invoked due to the inadequate justification. Citing *People v. Baluyot* and *People v. Lim*, the SC emphasizes the strict interpretation of the three-witness rule to avoid wrongful arrests or evidence planting.
*   **Impact of Non-Compliance:** The failure to strictly comply with Section 21 created a gap in the chain of custody, rendering the identity of the seized plants unreliable and leading to reasonable doubt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** Strict interpretation of this section, particularly the three-witness rule and the necessary justifications for non-compliance, remains contentious and heavily impacts drug-related cases.
*   **"Earnest Efforts" Standard:** The precise definition of "earnest efforts" required to secure witnesses is subject to interpretation and often litigated. The SC underscored that this requires more than mere perfunctory attempts.
*   **Location of Initial Inventory** The case touches on where the initial inventory should occur. This is usually done at the site of the arrest, however, it can be done at the nearest police station if necessary.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Ben G. Bation due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically related to non-compliance with the three-witness rule prescribed by Section 21 of RA 9165. The case underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug-related cases to protect the rights of the accused and prevent potential abuse.
