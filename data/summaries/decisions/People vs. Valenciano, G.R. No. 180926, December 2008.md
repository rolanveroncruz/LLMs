## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Valenciano* (G.R. No. 180926)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Lourdes Valenciano y Dacuba*

**Citation:** 594 Phil. 235 (G.R. No. 180926, December 10, 2008)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Second Division)

**Holding:** Affirms the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Lourdes Valenciano for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Valenciano, claiming to be an employee of Middle East International Manpower Resources, Inc. (whose license had expired), recruited four complainants (De Luna, De Villa, Dela Cuesta, Candelaria) for overseas employment in Taiwan as factory workers, collecting placement fees ranging from P62,000 to P70,000 per applicant.
*   **Charges:** Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale under Article 13(b) of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 442 (Labor Code), in relation to Art. 38(a) and penalized under Art. 39(c) of the same Code.
*   **Defense:** Valenciano claimed she was a mere employee, lacked knowledge of any criminal intent, and didn't directly receive the payments.  Argued good faith.
*   **Evidence:** Complainants testified to Valenciano's recruitment activities and receipt of payments.  POEA certification confirmed that neither Valenciano nor her co-accused (Rodante Imperial, Teresita Imperial, Rommel Imperial) were authorized to recruit workers.  Middle East International Manpower Resources, Inc.'s license had expired.
* **Elements of the Crime:** The Court uses People v. Jamilosa to outline the three elements needed to prove illegal recruitment in large scale:
    1.  The person charged undertook a recruitment activity under Article 13(b) or any prohibited practice under Article 34 of the Labor Code;
    2.  Accused did not have the license or the authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of workers; and
    3.  Accused committed the same against three or more persons individually or as a group.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction:** Valenciano was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.
*   **Penalty:** Sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.
*   **Indemnification:** Ordered to indemnify each of the four complainants (De Luna, De Villa, Dela Cuesta, and Candelaria) for the amounts they paid (P70,000.00, P70,000.00, P62,000.00 and P69,000.00, respectively).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of License:** A key element is the absence of a valid license or authority from the POEA to engage in recruitment.  The expired license and POEA certifications proved critical.
*   **Employee Liability:** The Court emphasizes that an employee of an illegally operating recruitment agency can be held liable as a principal if they actively participated in the illegal recruitment, regardless of their claimed lack of knowledge.
*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** The "good faith" defense was rejected. Illegal recruitment in large scale is *malum prohibitum*, not *malum in se*.
*   **Payment Receipt Issue:** Argument that the money was not taken by the accused was rendered insufficient by the court's finding and prior case law that states as long as the accused "promises or offers for a fee employment" they may be convicted.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines (PD 442):** Art. 13(b), Art. 38(a), Art. 39(c). Defines Illegal Recruitment and its penalties.
*   **People v. Mateo:** Procedure for appealing cases with life sentences.
*   **People v. Cabais:** Employee liability in illegal recruitment.
*   **People v. Gutierrez:** Good faith is not a defense in illegal recruitment.
*   **Springsun Management Systems Corporation v. Camerino:** Findings of fact of the trial court are affirmed by the CA, these are final and conclusive upon this Court.
*   **People v. Jamilosa:** Defines the elements needed to prove illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points:**

*   Whether Valenciano was truly an "employee" or an active participant in the recruitment scheme. The court sided with her active participation argument.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   Focusing on the proof of active participation in recruitment, not just being present or an employee.
*   Challenging the credibility of the complainants' testimony regarding payments made directly to Valenciano (although difficult given concurrent factual findings).
*   Revisiting the penalty and indemnity amounts, although this is unlikely to succeed given the mandatory penalties prescribed by the Labor Code.
