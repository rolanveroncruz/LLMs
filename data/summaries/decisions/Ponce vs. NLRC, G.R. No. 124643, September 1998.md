Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Nazario M. Ponce, et al. v. National Labor Relations Commission, P&R Parts Machineries Corporation, et al.* G.R. No. 124643, September 29, 1998 (Motion for Reconsideration).

**Summary:**

This is a Resolution denying P&R Parts and Machineries Corporation's (P&R) Motion for Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court decision that had reinstated the Labor Arbiter's (LA) ruling.  The LA had found: (1) an employer-employee relationship existed between P&R and the petitioners; (2) their termination was illegal; and (3) P&R and BRGT Agency (alleged independent contractor) were jointly and severally liable for backwages, wage differentials, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Supreme Court affirmed the LA's finding that P&R was the employer of petitioners based on evidence showing control and supervision by P&R.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The Court upheld the earlier finding of labor-only contracting by BRGT Agency. BRGT lacked substantial capital/investment, separate business operations, and served merely to provide employees to P&R under P&R's control, violating Article 106 of the Labor Code.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Due to the determination of employer-employee relationship and labor-only contracting, the termination of the petitioners by P&R was deemed illegal.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** P&R and BRGT Agency are held jointly and severally liable for backwages, wage differentials, and attorney's fees.

**Obligations:**

*   P&R is obligated to reinstate the petitioners to their former positions with full status and rights as regular employees.
*   P&R and BRGT are obligated to pay, jointly and severally, the specified amounts for backwages, wage differentials, and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   P&R faces liability for illegal dismissal and violation of labor laws regarding contracting.
*   Both P&R and BRGT are liable for the monetary awards to the petitioners.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Res Judicata Argument Rejected:** P&R argued *res judicata* based on a prior case (NLRC Case No. RAB-IV-6-6720-94-RI) where striking workers were terminated for cause. The Court rejected this, noting that the prior case involved different individuals and that the NLRC itself acknowledged that the petitioners here were not necessarily part of the strike that led to those terminations.
*   **BRGT Agency's Denial:** BRGT Agency disclaimed its contractual relationship with P&R and the supervision and control over the petitioners which indicates lack of evidence to legitimize the contractual relationship.
*   **Economic Hardship Argument Rejected:** P&R's plea based on current economic conditions and the need for retrenchment was rejected by the Court as insufficient justification for overturning the prior decision.
*   **Five Month Contract:** The alleged 5-month contract with BRGT agency commenced after the petitioners had already begun employment with P&R.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 106 of the Labor Code:**  Key provision regarding permissible contracting and prohibition of labor-only contracting.
*   Implied reference to the requirements for legitimate independent contractors.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The document doesn't explicitly state the exact date of the termination, making it difficult to calculate the precise amount of backwages owed if reinstatement isn't feasible. The lack of specific details about BRGT's licensing and bonding.

**Conclusion:**

The Court unequivocally rejects P&R's attempt to overturn the findings of illegal dismissal and labor-only contracting. P&R faces significant financial liabilities. Focus is on proving that BRGT was not a legitimate contractor.
