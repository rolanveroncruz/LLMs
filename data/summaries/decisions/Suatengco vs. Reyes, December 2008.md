**Case Summary: Suatengco vs. Reyes, G.R. No. 162729 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking modification of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision in a collection suit with damages.

**Key Facts:**

*   Spouses Suatengco (Petitioners) borrowed money from Reyes (Respondent) to pay their debt to Philphos.
*   Reyes paid Philphos P1,336,313.00 on May 31, 1994.
*   Petitioners executed a Promissory Note on June 24, 1994, agreeing to pay Reyes P1,336,313.00 in 31 monthly installments.
*   Petitioners made only one payment of P15,000.00.
*   The RTC declared Petitioners in default and ruled in favor of Reyes, awarding actual damages (P1,321,313.00 plus 12% interest), moral damages (P1,000,000.00), and attorney's fees (20% of the sum collected).
*   The CA affirmed the RTC decision but reduced moral damages to P200,000.00.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Promissory Note:**  The core agreement, stipulating joint and several liability for P1,336,313.00, payable in installments. It contains a waiver of demand and notice of dishonor. It specifies a 12% per annum interest rate on the outstanding balance and attorney's fees equivalent to 5% of the total outstanding indebtedness in case of default.
*   **Acceleration Clause:** Failure to pay any installment renders the entire unpaid balance immediately due and demandable.
*   **Attorney's Fees Clause:** The promissory note stipulates attorney's fees at 5% of the total outstanding indebtedness.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:**  Obligated to pay the principal debt (P1,321,313.00), 12% interest per annum from May 31, 1994, and attorney's fees. Jointly and severally liable.
*   **Respondent:** Obligated to credit any payments made by petitioners.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Attorney's Fees:** The RTC and CA initially awarded attorney's fees at 20%, contradicting the 5% stipulated in the Promissory Note. This was the central issue of contention.
*   **Interpretation of Attorney's Fees:**  The Supreme Court characterized the attorney's fees as liquidated damages/penalty clause, not as attorney's fees recoverable under the Rules of Court. *Ligutan v. Dela Llana, G.R. No. 138677* establishes the accessory nature of a penalty clause.
*   **Reasonableness of Interest:** While the 12% interest was upheld, arguments could have been made challenging its reasonableness under usury laws or principles of equity, had the issue been raised.
*   **Moral Damages:** While the amount was reduced by the CA, the basis for awarding moral damages seems tenuous, relying on the respondent's hurt feelings.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1169 & 2226:** Imposition of interest and liquidated damages.
*   Reference to legal interest under *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412*.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Chua v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 109840:**  Contracts are interpreted as written; courts cannot rewrite them.
*   **Ba√±as v. Asia Pacific Finance Corporation, G.R. No. 128703:** Written agreements prevail over oral evidence.  This principle was crucial to the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412:**  Guidelines for the imposition of legal interest.
*   **Ligutan v. Dela Llana, G.R. No. 138677:** Liquidated damages
*   **Consing v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143584:** Legal Interest

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *modified* the CA decision, reducing the attorney's fees to 5% as stipulated in the Promissory Note, but *affirmed* the decision in all other respects (including the P200,000 moral damages and 12% interest).  The Court emphasized that the parties' written agreement regarding attorney's fees should be upheld. The 12% interest from the breach until finality was upheld based on the agreement. After the judgment becomes final and executory, the amount adjudged will bear legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum until full payment.

**Potential Arguments (If representing the Suatengcos):**

*   *Argue for further reduction or elimination of moral damages.* The basis for the award seems weak and rooted in personal feelings rather than demonstrable injury.
*   If not time-barred, challenge the initial debt calculations, if possible.

**Potential Arguments (If representing Reyes):**

*   Enforce the judgment expeditiously, ensuring the correct calculation of interest at each stage (12% contractual interest until finality, then 12% legal interest thereafter).
