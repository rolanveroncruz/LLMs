**Case:** *The Manila Banking Corporation vs. Spouses Alfredo and Celestina Rabina and Marenir Development Corporation*, G.R. No. 145941, December 16, 2008.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the HLURB's jurisdiction and the dismissal of Manila Banking Corporation's (TMBC) appeal due to procedural lapses. TMBC, as mortgagee, is bound by HLURB's decision regarding the invalidity of the mortgage against lot buyer Celestina Rabina and the order to release the mortgage.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Invalidity of Mortgage:** The mortgage executed by Marenir Development Corporation (MDC) in favor of TMBC is valid only as a contract of indebtedness *between* MDC and TMBC but invalid and ineffective against Celestina Rabina (and the rest of the world) as a lot buyer.
*   **Release of Mortgage:** TMBC is directed to release the mortgage on Rabina's lot and surrender the title.
*   **HLURB Jurisdiction:** HLURB has jurisdiction over the case under Presidential Decree No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree) and PD 1344 regarding unsound real estate practices and claims by lot buyers.
*   **Section 18, P.D. 957:** Mortgages on subdivision lots by the developer require prior HLURB approval. Proceeds must be used for the *development* of the project.
*   **Section 17, P.D. 957:** Places the duty on the SELLER, not the buyer, to register the Contract to Sell and/or the Deed of Assignment.

**Obligations:**

*   **TMBC:** To release the mortgage on Celestina Rabina's lot.
*   **MDC:** (Decision final as to MDC)  Forfeiture of performance bond and potential liability for moral damages and administrative fines.

**Liabilities:**

*   **TMBC:**  Potentially liable for failure to release mortgage, subject to HLURB directives. However, The liability for moral damages does not fall on petitioner but on MDC.
*   **MDC:**  Liable for moral damages awarded to Rabina.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **TMBC:** Continued legal challenges by TMBC will be met with the Supreme Court's affirmation of the CA decision. Any foreclosure attempts on the property will likely be blocked.
*   **MDC:** May have difficulty complying with HLURB orders due to receivership of TMBC and the forfeiture of the performance bond.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):**  Basis for HLURB jurisdiction and protections afforded to lot buyers. Specifically cited Sections 17 & 18.
*   **P.D. 1344:** Expanded jurisdiction of the NHA (now HLURB) to include cases of unsound real estate practices.
*   **Executive Order No. 648:** Transferred regulatory and quasi-judicial functions of the NHA to the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission (HSRC).
*   **Executive Order No. 90:** Renamed the HSRC as the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB).
*   **Union Bank v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, G.R. No. 95364, June 29, 1992, 210 SCRA 558, 564.:** HLURB's jurisdiction to regulate real estate trade includes jurisdiction over complaints for annulment of mortgage.
*   **Far East Bank and Trust Co. v. Marquez, G.R. No. 147964, January 20, 2004, 420 SCRA 349.:** Section 18 of P.D. 957 is a prohibitory law and acts committed contrary to it are void.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** N/A in this specific ruling. The contentious issue of HLURB jurisdiction and the validity of the mortgage were definitively resolved against TMBC.

**Note:** TMBC's argument invoking Section 29 of Republic Act 265 (The Central Bank Act) regarding assets in *custodia legis* was indirectly dismissed, as the HLURB action predates the receivership. The procedural history of the case reveals a weak attempt by TMBC to appeal, which was further weakened by the Court's decision.
