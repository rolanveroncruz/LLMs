Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Farouk B. Abubakar, Ulama S. Baraguir, and Datukan M. Guiani vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. Nos. 202408, 202409, 202412)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** June 27, 2018

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari challenging the Sandiganbayan's Decision and Resolution finding Petitioners guilty of multiple counts of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners were public officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (DPWH-ARMM). Guiani was the Regional Secretary, Baraguir was the Director of the Bureau of Construction, Materials and Equipment, and Abubakar held the position of Director III, Administrative, Finance Management Service.
*   The case stems from alleged irregularities in the implementation of ARMM infrastructure projects funded by the national government. The Commission on Audit (COA) investigated and found overpayment, irregular advance payments, and bidding irregularities.
*   Specifically, the Sandiganbayan found:
    *   Guiani and Baraguir guilty of giving unwarranted benefits to contractors by allowing them to mobilize equipment *before* public bidding (Criminal Case Nos. 24963-24969). Certificates of mobilization were issued *prior* to the bidding dates.
    *   Guiani, Abubakar, and Baraguir guilty of causing the disbursement of excessive mobilization fees (30%) to Arce Engineering Services, exceeding the 15% limit under Presidential Decree No. 1594 (Criminal Case No. 24970).
    *   Guiani, Abubakar, and Baraguir guilty of facilitating advance payments for sub-base aggregates, violating Section 88(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1445. These items are excluded from a pre-payment scheme (Criminal Case Nos. 24972, 24975-24980, 24982-24983).
    *   The Sandiganbayan acquitted them of other charges related to alleged overpayment on projects (Criminal Case Nos. 24973, 24974, and 24981) and an unnecessary detailed engineering survey (Criminal Case No. 24971).

**Issues:**

1.  Whether Abubakar and Baraguir are entitled to a new trial due to alleged incompetence of their former counsel.
2.  Whether Abubakar and Baraguir's right to equal protection was violated due to "selective prosecution."
3.  Whether the prosecution established Guiani, Baraguir, and Abubakar's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019.
4.  Whether Guiani, Baraguir, and Abubakar should be exonerated based on the *Arias v. Sandiganbayan* doctrine.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **DENIED** the petitions and **AFFIRMED** the Sandiganbayan's Decision and Resolution.  Abubakar was found guilty on 10 counts, and Baraguir and Guiani were found guilty on 17 counts each of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **New Trial:**  The Court held that the petitioners failed to prove they had a meritorious defense and the omitted evidence would likely change the outcome. They also failed to prove their counsel was grossly negligent, falling short of "clear abandonment" of their case.  Cites *U.S. v. Umali, De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan, Callangan v. People, and Abrajano v. Court of Appeals* to distinguish situations warranting new trial for counsel incompetence.
2.  **Selective Prosecution:** Petitioners failed to show "clear and intentional discrimination" in the prosecution, required to establish a violation of the equal protection clause (cites *People v. Dela Piedra, People v. Dumlao, People v. Pineda, Alberto v. De la Cruz*). The discretion to prosecute lies with the fiscal.
3.  **Violation of Section 3(e) RA 3019:** The Court found that the elements of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 were satisfied. "Manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence" are sufficient. Cites *Uriarte v. People.*
    *   Giving unwarranted benefit to contractors through pre-bidding mobilization.
    *   Entering into contracts authorizing excessive mobilization fees (violating Presidential Decree 1594).
    *   Approving advance payments for sub-base aggregates without proper documentation or presidential approval, violating Presidential Decree No. 1445.
4.  **Arias Doctrine Inapplicable:** The Court held that the *Arias v. Sandiganbayan* doctrine (reliance on subordinates) does not apply because the petitioners had foreknowledge of circumstances that should have prompted further investigation. The irregularities were apparent on the face of the documents (e.g., certificates of mobilization with dates prior to bidding, contracts with illegal stipulations). The officials had a duty to exercise a higher degree of diligence.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019:**  Prohibits public officials from causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1594:**  Governs government contracts, competitive bidding, and advance payments (limited to 15%).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1445:**  Governs government auditing and prohibits advance payments without proper delivery and inspection.
*   **Memorandum Order No. 341 and DPWH Guidelines:** allows government agencies implementing government infrastructure projects to procure cement, reinforcing steel bars, and asphalt on a pre-payment basis.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability under Section 3(e) of RA 3019, resulting in imprisonment, disqualification from public office.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *Arias* doctrine defense is commonly invoked but difficult to succeed with if the official had a clear duty to investigate or had knowledge of irregularities.
*   "Undue injury" can be interpreted broadly. While actual damages must be proven, a showing of unwarranted benefits can establish a violation without necessarily proving pecuniary loss.
