## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gaylon*, G.R. No. 219086 (2018)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the Court of Appeals' (CA) and Regional Trial Court's (RTC) convictions for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Acquittal:** The Supreme Court (SC) acquitted the accused due to reasonable doubt.

**Obligations/Duties Violated (Prosecution):**

*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165:** Failure to comply with mandatory chain of custody requirements. Specifically:
    *   Lack of evidence that the Inventory of Seized Properties/Items was prepared in the presence of a media representative, DOJ representative, and any elected public official.
    *   Absence of signatures from these individuals on the inventory.
    *   No justifiable explanation provided for this non-compliance.
    *   Failure to offer as evidence any photograph of the seized shabu at the time of seizure.

**Liabilities/Risks (Prosecution):**

*   **Failure to Establish Chain of Custody:** The prosecution failed to prove an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drug, raising doubts about its integrity and identity as evidence.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:**  The SC emphasized the accused's constitutional right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecution's case was insufficient to overcome this presumption.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Basis of the criminal charge.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):**  Addresses the chain of custody requirements for seized drugs.
*   ***People v. Miranda, Jr.,*** G.R. No. 206880, June 29, 2016: Emphasizes the presumption of innocence.
*   ***People v. Lumudag,*** G.R. No. 201478, August 23, 2017: Highlights the importance of strict compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.  This case is specifically cited regarding the failure to justify non-compliance.
*   ***People v. Macud*** G.R. No. 219175, December 14, 2017: Insulating witnesses should be present during marking or their absence should be with valid justification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Facts:**

*   **Conflicting Testimony:** PO1 Nervar's conflicting statements regarding when the photograph of the buy-bust money was taken (before or after the operation).
*   **Insufficient Justification:** The police offered no justifiable explanation for the absence of required witnesses during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs. PO2 Catarataâ€™s claim that coordination with the local officials could have compromised the buy-bust operation was considered insufficient.
*   **Exhibit "J"**: Exhibit "J" was a blurred picture of the buy-bust money together with what appeared to be a small plastic sachet with the blurred marking "FNB 03/05/09" BUYBUST and an illegible signature. Furthermore, it was only offered and admitted as a picture of the buy-bust money and not of the seized shabu.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidence Suppression:** Failure to properly document and preserve the chain of custody will likely lead to suppression of the evidence.
*   **Acquittal:**  Failure to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt will result in acquittal, as happened in this case.
*   **Civil Liability:**  While not explicitly addressed, potential exists for civil action against law enforcement for wrongful arrest and detention, especially given the questionable circumstances of the arrest.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the critical importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody requirements outlined in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. The prosecution's failure to comply with these requirements, and their inability to provide justifiable reasons for non-compliance, led to the Supreme Court's reversal of the lower courts' convictions. This decision serves as a reminder to law enforcement agencies of the necessity to meticulously follow prescribed procedures in drug-related cases to ensure the integrity of evidence and protect the rights of the accused.
