**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Jeffrey Collamat a.k.a. "Ric-Ric", Jimbo Saladaga and Ronilo Rondina* (G.R. No. 218200, August 15, 2018)

**Summary:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Jeffrey Collamat for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. Collamat was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the stabbing death of Esmeralda Gelido. The prosecution's key witness, Benido Jumao-as, positively identified Collamat as one of the individuals who held the victim while co-accused Jimbo Saladaga stabbed her. The RTC and CA both found treachery to be a qualifying circumstance. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings, finding the positive identification credible and the defense of alibi weak.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder):** This is the core statutory basis for the conviction.

*   **Treachery as a Qualifying Circumstance:** The findings of the lower courts which were affirmed, established that the attack was sudden and ensured the victim had no chance to defend themselves, thus qualifying the crime as murder.

*   **Positive Identification:** Jumao-as's consistent and unwavering identification of Collamat as one of the perpetrators was critical to the conviction.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Collamat is subject to the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Collamat is liable to pay the victim's heirs:
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Temperate Damages: P50,000.00
    *   6% interest per annum on all damages from the date of finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** Although the courts found Jumao-as credible, witness credibility is always a point of potential attack.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The defense of alibi was deemed weak because the prosecution established that the accused was identified as one of the perpetrators of the crime.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Aquino, 396 Phil. 303, 306-307 (2000):** Appellate courts defer to trial court assessments of witness credibility due to their direct observation.
*   **Reyes, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, 424 Phil. 829 (2002):** Trial court findings on credibility are not overturned absent a clear showing of overlooked facts.
*   **People v. Clemeno, G.R. No. 215202, March 14, 2018.** Alibi and denial are weak defenses if accused is positively identified.
*   **People v. Alajay, 456 Phil. 83, 92 (2003):** Defines treachery, emphasizing the deliberate means to ensure execution without risk to the offender.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 846-848 (2016):** Defines the applicable legal principle that dictates the monetary penalties, such as civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and temperate damages, awarded in this case.
