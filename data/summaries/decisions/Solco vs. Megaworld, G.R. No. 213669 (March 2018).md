Okay, here's a legal summary of the *Jerome K. Solco vs. Megaworld Corporation* case, formatted in markdown:

**Case Summary: Jerome K. Solco vs. Megaworld Corporation (G.R. No. 213669)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision which nullified a tax sale and subsequent conveyance.

**Facts:**

*   Megaworld owned parking slots covered by CCTs.  Delinquent real property taxes (2000-2008) led to a Warrant of Levy and public auction.
*   Solco was the highest bidder and received Certificates of Sale, and later a Final Deed of Conveyance.
*   Solco filed an action to nullify Megaworld's titles and obtain new ones.
*   Megaworld opposed, arguing that it had previously sold the units to Dimaporo and Delos Santos, who were responsible for the taxes, and that the auction proceedings were fatally flawed (lack of notice, improper publication, etc.) in violation of RA 7160.
*   Delos Santos filed a separate case with similar arguments which was settled with Solco.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Solco.
*   CA reversed, finding irregularities in the tax sale proceedings due to Solco's failure to prove compliance with Sections 254, 256, 258, and 260 of RA 7160 (Local Government Code). Specifically, failure to prove proper notice to Megaworld, posting and publication of delinquency notices, and proper annotation of the Warrant of Levy.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 7160, Sections 254, 258, 260:**  Detailed requirements for notice of delinquency, levy on real property, and advertisement/sale of property for tax delinquency.  *Strict compliance* is required.
*   **RA 7160, Section 267:** Requires the taxpayer to deposit the amount of the sale plus interest before the court can entertain any action assailing the validity of a tax sale.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The purchaser at the tax sale (Solco) has the burden of proving compliance with all requirements of RA 7160.
*   **Deposit Requirement:** Megaworld is ordered to deposit with the trial court the amount to be paid to Solco, pursuant to Section 267 of RA 7160, as the buyer in the tax delinquency sale adjudged to be null and void in this case.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Solco:** Loses property ownership.  Entitled to reimbursement of the purchase price plus interest, contingent upon Megaworld depositing the required amount with the trial court per Section 267 of RA 7160.
*   **Megaworld:** Required to deposit the purchase price plus interest to reimburse Solco to comply with Section 267 of the LGC.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdictional Bond (RA 7160, Sec 267):** Solco argued that Megaworld should have been required to post a bond. The Court held that the requirement applies only to initiatory actions to annul a tax sale, not defenses raised in a land registration case. Although, they also specified that Megaworld would be responsible for complying with this section for Solco's reimbursement.
*   **Notice:**  The central issue is whether proper notice was given to Megaworld and other interested parties (Dimaporo/Delos Santos). The CA found that the notice was deficient.
*   **Bona Fide Purchaser:** Solco argued he was a bona fide purchaser. The Court rejected this, noting Dimaporo's possession of the property should have prompted further inquiry. The Court also held that there is no presumption of regularity in any administrative action which resulted in depriving a citizen or taxpayer of his property.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Talusan v. Tayag, 408 Phil. 373, 386 (2001):*** Land registration courts, as such, can now hear and decide even controversial and contentious cases, as well as those involving substantial issues.
*   ***Spouses Plaza v. Lustiva, et al., 728 Phil. 359, 369 (2014):*** A simple reading of the title readily reveals that the provision relates to actions for annulment of tax sales. The section likewise makes use of terms "entertain" and "institution" to mean that the deposit requirement applies only to initiatory actions assailing the validity of tax sales.
*   ***National Housing Authority v. Iloilo City, et al., 584 Phil. 604, 611 (2008):*** Such deposit is meant to reimburse the purchaser of the amount he had paid at the tax sale should the court declare the sale invalid.
*   ***Spouses Ramon and Rosita Tan v. Gorgonia Bantegui, represented by Guadalupe B. Bautista, and Spouses Florante and Florencia B. Caedo, 510 Phil. 434 (2005):***The auction sale of land to satisfy alleged delinquencies in the payment of real estate taxes derogates or impinges on property rights and due process. Thus, the steps prescribed by law for the sale, particularly the notices of delinquency and of sale, must be followed strictly. Failure to observe those steps invalidates the sale.
*   ***Arsenio Camo v. Jose Riosa Boyco, 29 Phil. 437, 445 (1915):*** Due process of law to be followed in tax proceedings must be established by proof and the general rule was that the purchaser of a tax title was bound to take upon himself the burden of showing the regularity of all proceedings leading up to the sale.
*   ***Corporate Strategies Development Corp., et al., v. Agojo, 747 Phil. 607, 620 (2014):***Strict adherence to the statutes governing tax sales is imperative not only for the protection of the taxpayers, but also to allay any possible suspicion of collusion between the buyer and the public officials called upon to enforce the laws.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code):**  Sections 254, 258, 260, and 267.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1529**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131[55]**

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court DENIED Solco's petition and AFFIRMED the CA decision.  The tax sale was declared NULL and VOID due to non-compliance with RA 7160. Megaworld is ordered to deposit the funds to reimburse Solco's purchase.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** Ensure strict compliance with notice requirements and all other procedures outlined in RA 7160 for any future tax sales.
*   **Third-Party Interests:**  When dealing with tax sales, investigate potential possessory rights or other claims beyond the record title.
*   **Reimbursement:** Be prepared to reimburse the purchaser if the tax sale is invalidated, and ensure compliance with the deposit requirements under Sec 267 of RA 7160.
