**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alvin Velasco y Huevos*, G.R. No. 219174, February 21, 2018 (826 Phil. 530)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision convicting Alvin Velasco of illegal sale of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine hydrochloride or *shabu*) under Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  The acquittal was based on reasonable doubt due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody, as required by Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, R.A. 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Prosecution must prove identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment.
*   **Section 21(1), R.A. 9165 & Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR:** Mandates a specific procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs. This includes:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography of the seized drugs after seizure and confiscation.
    *   Presence of the accused, or their representative/counsel.
    *   Presence of representatives from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ).
    *   Presence of any elected public official.
    *   Signatures of the required witnesses on the inventory and copies provided to them.

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   Violation of Section 5, R.A. 9165: Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 (as applied by the lower court) if convicted.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The prosecution failed to establish the reasons for non-compliance.
*   **Chain of Custody Breaches:** The marking, inventory, and photographing were not done immediately at the site of the buy-bust operation or in the presence of all required witnesses, and without a justifiable reason for the deviation.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court rejected the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty due to the unexplained non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.
*   **Saving Clause Ambiguity:** While the IRR provides a "saving clause" for non-compliance, its application requires the prosecution to offer a justifiable reason, which was absent in this case.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  The primary law governing illegal drugs, focusing on Section 5 (illegal sale) and Section 21 (chain of custody).
*   **IRR of R.A. No. 9165:** Provides the detailed implementing rules, particularly regarding the requirements of Section 21.
*   **People v. Sanchez, G. R. No. 175832, October 15, 2008, 569 SCRA 194, 212:** Outlines the need for the state to provide a fitting explanation for non-compliance with the procedures in Section 21, R.A. 9165.
*   **People v. Adrid, G.R. No. 201845, March 6, 2013, 692 SCRA 683, 697; Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 164580, February 6, 2009, 578 SCRA 147, 154:** These cases highlight the elements that the prosecution must prove to establish the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Geronimo, G.R. No. 180447, August 23, 2017:** States that it is the State's burden to justify at trial the lapses in the chain of custody.
*   **Ruling's Implication:** This case reinforces the strict adherence to the procedural safeguards outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 to protect the accused's rights and prevent wrongful convictions. Failure to substantially comply and provide justifiable reasons for deviations can lead to acquittal based on reasonable doubt.
