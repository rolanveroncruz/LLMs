**Legal Document Summary: *Central Azucarera de Bais and Antonio Steven L. Chan vs. Heirs of Zuelo Apostol*, G.R. No. 215314, March 14, 2018 (828 Phil. 211)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:**  Whether Zuelo Apostol's (deceased, represented by heirs) termination was for just cause and with due process.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and NLRC decisions, reinstating the Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing Apostol's complaint. The Court found the dismissal was valid.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer's Management Prerogative:**  The Court affirmed the employer's right to exercise management prerogatives in good faith.
*   **Violation of Company Rules:** Apostol, a motor pool supervisor, used company equipment and materials for personal vehicle repairs without permission, violating company rules. This was admitted by Apostol.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** The employer (CAB) complied with the twin-notice requirement, providing written notice of the violation and a subsequent termination notice.  The Court relied on *Perez vs. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company*, 602 Phil. 522 (2009), emphasizing that a formal hearing is not always mandatory for procedural due process, as "ample opportunity to be heard" can be satisfied by other meaningful means.
*   **Substantive Due Process – Breach of Trust:** Apostol's actions constituted a willful breach of trust, a just cause for termination under Article 297(c) [formerly Article 282(c)] of the Labor Code. The Court applied the *Top Form Mfg. Co., Inc. vs. NLRC*, 290-A Phil. 63 (1992), line of cases.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:**  The Court applied the two-pronged test for loss of trust and confidence from *Alaska Milk Corporation vs. Ponce*, G.R. No. 228412, July 26, 2017, and *Sta. Ana vs. Manila Jockey Club*, G.R. No. 208459, February 15, 2017. Apostol held a position of trust and confidence (custody and handling of company property), and his actions warranted the loss of that trust.
*   **No Backwages/Separation Pay:** Because the dismissal was for just cause and with due process, Apostol's heirs were not entitled to backwages or separation pay.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Philippine Auto Components, Inc. v. Ronnie B. Jumadla, et al.,* GR. No. 218980, November 28, 2016
*   *Perez vs. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Company*, 602 Phil. 522 (2009) - Procedural due process, ample opportunity to be heard.
*   *Top Form Mfg. Co., Inc. vs. NLRC*, 290-A Phil. 63 (1992) – Employer's right to dismiss for breach of trust.
*   *Moya vs. First Solid Rubber Industries, Inc.*, 718 Phil. 77 (2013) - Loss of trust and confidence for supervisors.
*   *Alaska Milk Corporation vs. Ponce*, G.R. No. 228412, July 26, 2017 – Two-pronged test for loss of trust.
*   *Sta. Ana vs. Manila Jockey Club*, G.R. No. 208459, February 15, 2017 - Loss of trust relating to duties.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Article 297(c) [formerly Article 282(c)] – Just causes for termination (breach of trust).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   While the "ample opportunity to be heard" standard was met, future cases might challenge whether the opportunity was *truly* meaningful.
*   The application of the "loss of trust and confidence" doctrine can be subjective. Strict adherence to the *Alaska Milk* and *Sta. Ana* tests is critical.
*   The Court emphasized that all requirements were met for a valid dismissal. Any deviation from procedure or the two-pronged test could lead to a different outcome.
