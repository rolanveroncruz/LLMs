## Legal Document Summary: *Northern Mindanao Industrial Port and Services Corporation v. Iligan Cement Corporation* (G.R. No. 215387)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision which reversed the RTC's order denying ICC's motion to dismiss NOMIPSCO's complaint for damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether NOMIPSCO has a cause of action against ICC based on abuse of rights (Article 19, Civil Code) in a bidding process where NOMIPSCO was not awarded the contract.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court **denies** the petition, affirming the CA's decision that NOMIPSCO lacks a cause of action.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Bidding Process:** ICC invited NOMIPSCO to bid on a cargo handling contract. NOMIPSCO submitted a bid but was not selected.
*   **Article 1326, Civil Code:** Advertisements for bidders are merely invitations to make proposals, and the advertiser is not bound to accept the lowest bidder unless otherwise specified.
*   **Change of Corporate Name:** Oroport (one of the bidders) changed its name to Europort Logistics and Equipment Incorporated after being selected. The Court cited jurisprudence stating that a change in corporate name does not create a new corporation, nor does it affect its rights or liabilities, referencing *Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc. v. Hartigan, 145 Phil. 310 (1970)*.
*   **Article 19, Civil Code:** NOMIPSCO argued that ICC abused its rights under Article 19 by conducting the bidding process in bad faith.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **NOMIPSCO's Claim:** NOMIPSCO claimed damages and attorney's fees based on alleged bad faith of ICC in the bidding process. The SC deems their evidence falsified and contemptible.
*   **ICC's Defense:** ICC argued that NOMIPSCO's complaint failed to state a cause of action.
*   **Risk of Frivolous Claims:** The Supreme Court warns NOMIPSCO against further attempts to manipulate facts, implying potential sanctions for pursuing a baseless claim.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 19, Civil Code:** Abuse of rights.
*   **Article 1326, Civil Code:** Offers and acceptances of bids.
*   **Zuellig Freight and Cargo Systems v. National Labor Relations Commission, 714 Phil. 401, 411 (2013):** On change of corporate name not creating a new corporation, citing *Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc. v. Hartigan, 145 Phil. 310 (1970)*.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Pinatubo Commercial, 630 Phil. 599 608 (2010):** Courts will not interfere in the exercise of discretion to accept or reject bids unless it's apparent that such discretion is exercised arbitrarily, or used as a shield to a fraudulent award.
*   **Privatization and Management Office v. Strategic Alliance Development Corporation, 711 Phil. 209, 223 (2013):** Right to reject bids signifies that participants of the bidding process cannot compel the party who called for bids to accept the bid.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Bad Faith:** NOMIPSCO argued that ICC acted in bad faith by using the bidding process as a mere ruse. This allegation was deemed unsubstantiated by the Court.
*   **Undisclosed Policies:** NOMIPSCO claimed that ICC awarded the contract based on undisclosed policies. The Court found no evidence to support this claim.

**Potential Issues/Concerns:**

*   **Lack of Evidence:** NOMIPSCO's claims were based on alleged bad faith and undisclosed policies, but the Court found no evidence to support these claims.
*   **Discretion of Advertiser:** The Court emphasizes that the advertiser (ICC) has the right to reject bids and is not obligated to accept the lowest bidder.
*   **Change of Corporate Name:** NOMIPSCO argued that Europort was ineligible because it was not a participant in the bidding process. However, the Court ruled that Europort was the same entity as Oroport, which had undergone a name change.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision that NOMIPSCO lacked a cause of action. The Court found that NOMIPSCO's claims of bad faith and abuse of rights were unsubstantiated and that ICC acted within its rights in rejecting NOMIPSCO's bid. The ruling underscores the principle that advertisements for bidders are merely invitations to make proposals, and the advertiser is not bound to accept the lowest bidder unless otherwise specified. The Supreme Court harshly rebuked petitioner, indicating the weakness of their case.
