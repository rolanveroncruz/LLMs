## Legal Document Summary: *Fe Cayao-Lasam vs. Spouses Claro and Editha Ramolete* (G.R. No. 159132, December 18, 2008)

**Case Summary:** This is a medical malpractice case where respondents (Spouses Ramolete) sued the petitioner (Dr. Cayao-Lasam) for gross negligence and malpractice relating to a D&C procedure performed on Editha.  Editha subsequently suffered a ruptured uterus and underwent a hysterectomy. The Board of Medicine initially exonerated Dr. Cayao-Lasam, but the PRC reversed this decision, revoking her medical license. The CA dismissed Dr. Cayao-Lasam's appeal. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed the CA and affirmed the Board of Medicine's initial exoneration.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Alleged Negligence:** Respondents claimed Dr. Cayao-Lasam was negligent in her pre-operative care, failing to perform internal examinations before recommending the D&C, and failing to remove the fetus.
*   **Petitioner's Defense:** Dr. Cayao-Lasam denied negligence, asserting that the D&C was necessary due to bleeding and an open cervix. She argued that Editha's condition (ruptured uterus and subsequent hysterectomy) was due to a rare case of abdominal placental implantation (placenta increta) and Editha's own negligence in failing to attend follow-up appointments.
*   **Expert Testimony:** Dr. Augusto Manalo, presented by the petitioner, testified that the D&C procedure was not the proximate cause of the ruptured uterus, and the rupture would have occurred earlier if it was due to the procedure.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The Supreme Court found that Editha's failure to attend follow-up appointments, as advised by Dr. Cayao-Lasam, was the proximate cause of her injury, breaking the chain of causation for medical negligence.
* Right to Appeal: This document states that both Complainant and respondent are able to appeal from the Board's decision to the PRC.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Physician's Duty of Care:**  Dr. Cayao-Lasam, as Editha's physician, had a duty to exercise the level of care and skill ordinarily employed by competent doctors under similar circumstances. *See* Medical malpractice definition.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Respondents had the burden to prove negligence, breach of duty, injury, and proximate causation.
*   **Patient's Duty of Care:** Editha had a duty to exercise reasonable care for her own health, including attending follow-up appointments.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Absence of Expert Testimony (Respondents' Case):** The PRC decision revoking Dr. Cayao-Lasam's license was vulnerable due to the respondents' failure to present expert testimony establishing causation. Expert testimony is essential to determine the reasonable level of care and breach thereof. *See* Medical malpractice definition.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Dr. Cayao-Lasam argued she was not properly notified of the appeal to the PRC, potentially violating her right to due process.
*   **Causation:** Proving the D&C caused the ruptured uterus or that a competent doctor would not have performed the D&C under the circumstances would have been critical for respondents' success, but they did not present expert testimony to confirm.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 43, Rules of Court:** Addressed the issue of whether appeals from the PRC lie with the CA. The Court determined that BP 129 (Batas Pambansa Blg. 129) gives the Court of Appeals appellate jurisdiction over decisions made by the PRC.
*   **Medical Act of 1959 (R.A. No. 2382), Section 26:** Addressed appeal from the decision of the Board of Medical Examiners.
*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Basis for the civil action for damages in medical malpractice cases.
*   **Article 2179, Civil Code:** Addresses the issue of the defendant's liability in case of negligence on the part of the plaintiff
*   **Yang v. Court of Appeals:** Supports that Batas Pambansa (B.P.) Blg. 129 conferred upon the CA exclusive appellate jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the PRC
*   **EDI-Staffbuilders International, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission:** Supports the right to due process and what is necessary in order to uphold due process.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinged on the failure of respondents to prove causation and the significance of Editha's failure to attend follow-up appointments. The Court emphasized that Dr. Cayao-Lasam exercised the appropriate level of care and the Editha's injury was due to her own negligence. The decision highlights the importance of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases and the patient's duty to adhere to medical advice.
