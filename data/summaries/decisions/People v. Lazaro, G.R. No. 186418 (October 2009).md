## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Lazaro, Jr.* (G.R. No. 186418, October 16, 2009)

**Overview:**

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which affirmed with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Alfredo Lazaro, Jr. for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale), and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). Lazaro was acquitted of violating Section 15 (illegal use) by the CA.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):**  Conviction upheld based on buy-bust operation; Prosecution established the identity of buyer (SPO1 Indunan) and seller (Lazaro), the object (0.05 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu), and the consideration (P300.00), along with delivery and payment. Elements for illegal sale are met as per *People v. Naquita* and related jurisprudence.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Conviction upheld based on the recovery of 0.04 gram of shabu from Lazaro's possession during the buy-bust. Established elements include: possession of a prohibited drug, unauthorized possession, and free and conscious possession as defined in *People v. Naquita*.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Lazaro argued the prosecution's failure to strictly comply with the procedures laid down in RA 9165. The Supreme Court finds that raising this issue for the first time on appeal is too late.  Non-compliance, under *People v. Sta. Maria*, is excusable under justifiable grounds, but the defendant failed to raise this objection in the lower courts. What is of "utmost importance" is preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items, as per *People v. Agulay*
*   **Buy-bust Operation as Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The Court rejects the argument that the buy-bust was instigation, noting the idea to sell originated from Lazaro. This confirms the validity of the entrapment as a legitimate means of arresting drug offenders as established in Philippine jurisprudence.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Alfredo Lazaro, Jr.):** Found guilty of illegal sale and illegal possession of shabu. Sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for illegal sale, and imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day (min) to 15 years (max) and a fine of P300,000.00 for illegal possession.
*   **Law Enforcement (Buy-Bust Team):** Duty to adhere to Section 21, RA 9165.  While strict compliance is preferred, substantial compliance that preserves the integrity of the evidence is sufficient when the prosecution has established an unbroken chain of custody.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Testimony from Forensic Analyst:** The court notes that the Forensic Analyst, Albon, did not testify but also notes that the defense admitted into evidence her laboratory report. This could be a point of contention if the defense later argued the admission was invalid or coerced.
*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:** While the court finds that the chain of custody was not broken, the defense noted gaps in the chain of custody of the subject drugs because the officer who received the request for laboratory examination of the same did not testify, and the custodian of the subject drugs from the time they were examined up to their presentation in trial was not identified. The court deemed these inconsequential, however.
*   **Informant Not Presented:** Failure to present the informant as a witness. The court cited relevant case law stating that this omission is permissible.
*   **Defense of Frame-Up:** The court highlights that the defense of frame-up is easily concocted and disfavored and was not proven with convincing evidence by the defendant.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)
*   Republic Act No. 9346 (Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165 are not detailed**: The court defers to the specific circumstances of each case.
*   **Chain of Custody concerns** are argued by the defendant to be broken due to gaps in evidence, but are found by the Court to not significantly impact the integrity of the evidence.
