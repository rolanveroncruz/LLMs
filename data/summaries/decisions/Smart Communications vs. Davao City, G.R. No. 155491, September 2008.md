## Legal Document Summary: Smart Communications, Inc. vs. City of Davao

**Case:** G.R. No. 155491, September 16, 2008 (587 Phil. 20)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Smart Communications, Inc. (Smart)
*   **Respondents:** City of Davao, represented by its Mayor and Sangguniang Panlungsod

**Issue:** Whether Smart is liable to pay franchise tax imposed by the City of Davao.

**Ruling:** Smart is liable to pay the local franchise tax imposed by the City of Davao, subject to certain limitations.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Smart's Argument:** Smart claimed exemption based on the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in its franchise (R.A. No. 7294, Sec. 9), arguing it covers both national and local taxes. They also invoked Section 23 of the Public Telecommunications Policy Act (R.A. No. 7925) to incorporate Globe's (R.A. 7229) tax exemption in their franchise.
*   **City of Davao's Argument:** The City invoked its constitutional power to create its own revenue sources and the power granted to it by the LGC.
*   **Court's Analysis:**
    *   **Prospective Effect of LGC:** The court agreed that the withdrawal of tax exemptions by the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160, Sec. 193) only applies to franchises granted *prior* to its effectivity. Since Smart's franchise was granted *after* the effectivity of the LGC, its franchise is not affected by Section 193 of the LGC.
    *   **"In Lieu Of" Clause Interpretation:** The court held that the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in R.A. No. 7294 is ambiguous and should be construed *strictly against* Smart. The court referred to jurisprudence, noting that such clauses generally apply only to *national internal revenue taxes* and not local taxes, unless expressly stated. The court also noted that Smart no longer pays the 3% franchise tax, as it now pays the 10% VAT, as per R.A. No. 7716.
    *   **R.A. No. 7925 (Equality Clause):** The Court rejected Smart's reliance on Section 23 of R.A. No. 7925 (the equality clause), citing PLDT v. City of Davao (415 Phil. 764, 2001), and Digitel v. Province of Pangasinan (G.R. No. 152534, February 23, 2007). The Court stated that the term "exemption" in Section 23 of R.A. No. 7925 refers to exemption from regulations by the NTC, not tax exemptions.
    *   **Non-Impairment Clause:** The court dismissed the argument that the local franchise tax violates the non-impairment clause, as Smart's franchise does not expressly provide exemption from local taxes, and the franchise is subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal.
    *   **Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) Opinion:** The court noted that the BLGF opinions are not conclusive on the courts, citing PLDT v. City of Davao (415 Phil. 764, 2001).

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   Smart is liable to pay the franchise tax imposed by the City of Davao.
*   The local franchise tax must comply with Sections 137 and 151 of R.A. No. 7160 (LGC), meaning it cannot exceed 50% of 1% of the gross annual receipts for the preceding calendar year based on income realized within Davao City.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguous "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise led to this litigation and continues to be a point of contention in franchise tax cases.
*   The interpretation of R.A. No. 7925, Section 23 (equality clause), has been consistently litigated, and the Supreme Court has clearly defined its limitations.
*   The actual computation of the local franchise tax must adhere strictly to the limitations imposed by Sections 137 and 151 of the LGC. Any deviation could be subject to challenge.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 7294 (Smart's Franchise)
*   R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code) - Sections 137, 151, and 193
*   R.A. No. 7925 (Public Telecommunications Policy Act) - Section 23
*   R.A. No. 7229 (Globe's Franchise)
*   R.A. No. 7716 (VAT Law)

**Case Law References:**

*   Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos (G.R. No. 120082, September 11, 1996)
*   Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Visayan Electric Company (132 Phil. 203, 1968)
*   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. v. City of Davao (415 Phil. 764, 2001; 447 Phil. 571, 2003)
*   Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Digitel) v. Province of Pangasinan (G.R. No. 152534, February 23, 2007)
*   Tolentino v. Secretary of Finance (G. R. No. 115455, August 25, 1994)

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the principle that tax exemptions are strictly construed against the taxpayer. The ambiguity of the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise, coupled with the limited scope of R.A. No. 7925, resulted in the denial of Smart's claim for exemption from local franchise taxes. The City of Davao has the right to impose such tax, subject to the limitations prescribed by the Local Government Code.
