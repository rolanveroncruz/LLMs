**Case:** *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. La Suerte Trading & Industrial Corporation*, G.R. No. 164875 (2009)

**Summary:**

BPI (successor-in-interest of FEBTC) sought to foreclose on properties mortgaged by La Suerte. La Suerte filed suit to nullify the mortgage, alleging lack of board authorization for Ricardo Joson to enter into it and sought a preliminary injunction to stop the foreclosure. The RTC initially issued a TRO and then a preliminary injunction. BPI appealed the grant of the preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals, arguing lack of a proper hearing in violation of Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeals initially dismissed BPI's petition, but the Supreme Court reversed, finding that no actual hearing on the preliminary injunction occurred due to the pending motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition and SET ASIDE the Court of Appeals decision that had upheld the lower court's grant of the preliminary injunction.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Validity of Mortgage:** The central legal issue revolves around the validity of the mortgage executed by Ricardo Joson without alleged authorization from La Suerte's Board of Directors.
*   **Preliminary Injunction:** The core dispute concerned the issuance of the preliminary injunction by the RTC.
*   **Rule 58, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Emphasizes the mandatory requirement of a hearing and prior notice before granting a preliminary injunction (unless specific exceptions apply).
*   **Due Process:** The SC decision hinged on the issue of whether BPI was afforded due process by the lower court.

**Liabilities:**

*   BPI faces potential liability if the mortgage is ultimately deemed invalid due to lack of proper authorization.
*   La Suerte faces potential liability on its loan obligations if the mortgage is ultimately deemed valid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of Mortgage:** The primary risk is the uncertainty surrounding the validity of the mortgage. If it lacks proper board authorization, it is likely unenforceable.  Case law on corporate powers and the necessity of board resolutions for significant corporate actions, especially encumbrances on real property, will be relevant.
*   **Foreclosure Proceedings:** If the mortgage is valid, La Suerte risks foreclosure on its properties.
*   **Deficiency Judgment:** If the foreclosure sale does not cover the full debt, BPI could pursue a deficiency judgment against La Suerte.
*   **Procedural Irregularities:** The RTC's failure to hold a hearing on the preliminary injunction, as alleged and ultimately proven, exposes the order to legal challenges, as evidenced by the successful appeal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 58, Section 5, Rules of Court:** The Supreme Court cited this section in its decision, emphasizing the hearing requirement for preliminary injunctions. The absence of said hearing being the central grounds to overturn the lower court's decision.
*   **Corporation Law (now Revised Corporation Code):** Pertaining to the powers of the board of directors and the requirement of board resolutions for major corporate actions (e.g., mortgaging corporate assets). The lack of authorization for Ricardo Joson will be challenged in relation to the pertinent provisions governing the same.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Authorization of Ricardo Joson:** The most contentious issue is the lack of alleged authorization for Ricardo Joson to mortgage the properties. The legal documents proving or disproving this claim would be contentious evidence.

**Next Steps for Lawyer:**

1.  **Investigate the Authority:** Diligently examine La Suerte's corporate records to determine if Ricardo Joson had the necessary board authorization (e.g., board resolution, articles of incorporation, by-laws) to mortgage the properties.
2.  **Review the Mortgage Documents:** Carefully scrutinize the mortgage documents for any irregularities or grounds for challenge (e.g., usury, unconscionable terms).
3.  **Assess Damages:** Calculate the potential damages to BPI if the mortgage is deemed invalid and alternative legal strategies for recovery.
4. **Consider Prescription:** Determine if the underlying obligation is past the statute of limitations.
5.  **Prepare for Trial:** Gather evidence and prepare for trial on the merits, focusing on the key issue of authority and the validity of the mortgage.
