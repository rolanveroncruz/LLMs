**Case Summary: _Antonio B. Gunsi, Sr. v. COMELEC and Datu Israel Sinsuat_ (G.R. No. 168792, February 23, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 (though the Court notes Rule 64 is the correct rule) challenging a COMELEC En Banc resolution affirming Gunsi's disqualification as Mayor of South Upi, Maguindanao.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Disqualification Basis:** Gunsi was disqualified due to not being a registered voter in South Upi, stemming from an unsigned voter registration application. Sinsuat (private respondent) filed the original petition for denial of due course or cancellation of Gunsi's COC.
*   **RA 8189, Section 10 (Voter's Registration Act):**  This is the crux of the case. It mandates *personal* accomplishment and signature on the voter registration form as a key requirement.
*   **Unsigned Application:** Gunsi's application lacked his signature on parts 2 and 3. The administering officer (Joel Ellano) also did not sign Part 3.
*   **COMELEC Findings:** The COMELEC found irregularities surrounding Gunsi's registration, noting the absence of a signature and the alleged irregular insertion of his name in the voter's list by Alice Lim, Acting Election Officer.
*   **Mootness Doctrine:** Initially, the COMELEC dismissed the case as moot because Sinsuat had been proclaimed mayor. This changed after a pre-proclamation case filed by Gunsi led to the annulment of Sinsuat's initial proclamation.
*   **COMELEC Clarification:** The COMELEC (Second Division) clarified its resolution, stating Gunsi *was* disqualified. This was affirmed by the COMELEC En Banc.
*   **Expiration of Term:** The Supreme Court acknowledged the case's mootness due to the expiration of the mayoral term on June 30, 2007. However, it addressed the merits.

**Obligations:**

*   **Applicant:** Obligation to personally complete and sign voter registration form (RA 8189, Sec. 10).
*   **COMELEC:** Duty to ensure compliance with voter registration laws and resolve disputes.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Gunsi:** Loss of election due to disqualification. Potential liability for violation of election laws if fraudulent intent or actions can be proven.
*   **Alice Lim:** Potential liability for election offenses related to irregular insertion of Gunsi's name on the voter's list.
*   **Risk of Repetition:** The court acknowledged an exception to the mootness doctrine for issues capable of repetition. This suggests a concern that similar situations could arise in future elections.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 and Rule 64, Rules of Court:** Procedural rules for certiorari and prohibition. The court notes the incorrect procedural rule was cited.
*   **RA 8189, Section 10 (Voter's Registration Act of 1996):** The primary statutory basis for the ruling. This section outlines voter registration requirements, particularly the need for a signed application.
*   *Dalumpines v. Court of Appeals* â€“ The COMELEC cited this case (unspecified citation) to support its finding that the absence of a signature casts doubt on the authenticity of a document. This is an apparent analogy to contract law.
*   *David v. Macapagal-Arroyo,* G.R. Nos. 171396, 171409, 171485, 171483, 171400, 171489, 171424, May 3, 2006, 489 SCRA 160 - The Court cited this case on the Mootness Doctrine.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **"Inadvertence" vs. Intent:** Gunsi argued his failure to sign was an "inadvertent" oversight. The COMELEC and the Supreme Court did not accept this argument, emphasizing the mandatory nature of the signature requirement under RA 8189.
*   **Irregular Insertion:** The ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of Alice Lim's insertion of Gunsi's name into the Voter's List. There is a lack of clarity on how active Lim was in this action.
*   **COMELEC's Authority to Clarify:** Gunsi questioned the COMELEC's jurisdiction and timing of the clarification order. While the Court didn't explicitly address the timing argument, it affirmed the clarification's validity by addressing the merits.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court upheld the COMELEC's decision to disqualify Gunsi based on his failure to comply with mandatory voter registration requirements. The ruling emphasizes the importance of personal compliance and signature on voter registration forms. While the case was technically moot, the court addressed the merits and the Supreme Court's decision serves as a precedent reinforcing the stringent requirements of RA 8189.
