Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Franco B. Gonzales vs. Atty. Danilo B. Bañares*, A.C. No. 11396, June 20, 2018 (833 Phil. 578)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Atty. Danilo B. Bañares for violation of notarial rules stemming from the notarization of a Deed of Absolute Sale (DAS). The complainant, Franco Gonzales, alleged irregularities in the DAS, specifically that his father (Rodolfo Gonzales) and himself were listed as a signatory and witness respectively but were not present.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation of Notarial Practice:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the IBP's finding that Bañares violated notarial practice. Key to this was the fact that Rodolfo Gonzales (a signatory) was not personally present before Bañares at the time of notarization.  The SC rejected Bañares' argument that pre-signing was acceptable.
*   **Rule II, Section 1 & Rule IV, Section 2(b) of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice:**  These rules explicitly require personal appearance of signatories before the notary public, and that the notary public is personally known or identified.  Bañares failed to comply with these rules.
*   **Violation of Canon 1, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** The SC held that Bañares' actions constituted "unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct" as he disregarded the law and legal processes.
*   **Nature of Notarization:** The SC emphasized that notarization is not a mere formality, but a process imbued with public interest. It ensures document authenticity and reliability, converting a private document into public. It stressed the importance of verifying signatures and ensuring the free and voluntary act of the parties.
* **Pre-signing of Documents:** The court strongly condemned the practice of pre-signing documents.

**Obligations:**

*   Lawyers must uphold the Constitution and obey the laws of the land (Canon 1, CPR).
*   Lawyers must not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct (Rule 1.01, CPR).
*   Notaries public have a duty to ensure the personal appearance of signatories and verify their identity and the genuineness of their signatures (2004 Rules on Notarial Practice).
*   Notaries public must not notarize documents unless they are certain the signatory executed the document and are present before them.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Bañares was found administratively liable.

**Penalties:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months.
*   Revocation of notarial commission (if presently commissioned).
*   Disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years.
*   Stern Warning: Further violations will be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case underscores the severe consequences for notaries who fail to adhere strictly to the rules of notarial practice. Even well-intentioned efforts to accommodate parties cannot excuse non-compliance.
*   The absence of explicit evidence suggesting actual fraudulent intent did not mitigate the penalty. The focus was on the procedural violation.
*   The case re-emphasizes that lawyers, especially notaries, must uphold the law and maintain the integrity of legal processes.

**Relevant Case Law (cited within the document):**
