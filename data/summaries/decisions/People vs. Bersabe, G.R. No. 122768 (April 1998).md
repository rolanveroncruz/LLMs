## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bersabe, G.R. No. 122768 (1998)

**Type:** Criminal Case - Rape

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Key Holding:** Affirms the lower court's conviction of Gregorio Bersabe for rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and ordering him to indemnify the victim.

**Facts:**

*   Accused was charged with rape of a 6-year-old girl.
*   Victim testified accused undressed her and inserted his finger and penis into her vagina, causing bleeding.
*   Medical examination corroborated victim's testimony with findings of vulva congestion and hymenal tears.
*   Accused denied the charges, raising alibi and claiming only acts of lasciviousness occurred.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape, particularly the provision addressing carnal knowledge of a woman under twelve years of age, thus, statutory rape.
*   **Accused's Obligation:** To refrain from violating laws against sexual assault.
*   **State's Obligation:** To protect children and prosecute those who violate laws against them.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment).
*   **Civil Liability:** Indemnification of the victim for P50,000.00, plus costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Credibility:** The defense challenged the credibility of a child witness. This case reaffirms the deference given to trial court findings on witness credibility, especially in sex crimes involving children.
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The accused offered an alibi, which was rejected. This case reaffirms the weakness of alibi as a defense if not supported by clear and convincing evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Rape. Key statutory basis for the conviction, specifically par. 3 dealing with victims under 12 years of age.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   Cited cases affirming the importance of trial court's assessment of witness credibility (e.g., *People v. Adora, People v. Caballes, People v. Alimon, People vs. Castromero*).
    *   Cases emphasizing that children are unlikely to fabricate rape stories and subject themselves to trauma and shame (e.g., *People v. Ramirez*).
    *   Cases stating that rape can occur in various places, time is not a respecter of rape (e.g., *People v. Talaboc, People v. Gecomo, People v. Dabon, People v. Codilla*)
    *   Cases upholding the unpredictability of victim behavior after emotional stress (e.g., *People v. Oarga*).
    *   Case about Fear making people immobile (e.g., *People v. Galas*)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense attempted to characterize the actions as "acts of lasciviousness" rather than rape, based on the alleged ambiguity in the victim's testimony during cross-examination. However, the court dismissed this argument, highlighting the victim's explicit testimony about penetration.
*   The defense claimed the locus criminis would make the event suspicious to other individuals in the area due to the presence of a local festival. This was dismissed based on existing precedent.

**Legal Precision:**

The court clearly differentiates between acts of lasciviousness and rape, emphasizing the importance of penetration for a rape conviction. The decision reiterates the importance of considering the totality of the evidence, including the victim's testimony, medical evidence, and the absence of ill motive, when assessing guilt in rape cases.

**Overall:**

This case serves as a strong affirmation of the protection afforded to child victims of sexual assault. It reinforces the weight given to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and the importance of corroborating evidence in rape cases. The court firmly rejects attempts to minimize the severity of the crime or to cast doubt on the victim's testimony without compelling evidence.
