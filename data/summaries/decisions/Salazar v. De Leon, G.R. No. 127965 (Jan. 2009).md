## Legal Document Summary: *Francisco Salazar vs. Reynaldo De Leon* (G.R. No. 127965, January 20, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order for Salazar to vacate and surrender a parcel of land to De Leon.

**Key Issue:** Whether the dispute is an agrarian dispute, placing jurisdiction with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) rather than the RTC.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) *GRANTS* the petition, reverses the CA and RTC decisions, and dismisses the original complaint due to lack of jurisdiction of the RTC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Land Ownership:** De Leon is the registered owner of the land under TCT No. T-85610.
*   **Original Complaint:** De Leon sought recovery of possession based on tolerance, claiming Salazar was allowed to cultivate the land without rent, subject to surrender upon demand. De Leon subsequently demanded Salazar to vacate the land.
*   **Salazar's Defense:** Salazar claimed a landlord-tenant relationship and the right to acquire the property under the Operation Land Transfer Program.
*   **Agricultural Leasehold Contract:** During the pendency of the appeal, an Agricultural Leasehold Contract was executed between Salazar and De Leon, seemingly confirming a tenancy relationship. (It's important to note while that this was presented to the court, they are treating this as written confirmation not a settlement).
*   **Jurisdiction:** SC held that since a tenancy relationship existed, the DARAB has primary and exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, not the RTC.

**Liabilities & Damages (REVERSED):**

*   The RTC originally ordered Salazar to vacate and surrender the land.
*   RTC originally ordered Salazar to pay P20,000 for unrealized fruits, P5,000 for attorney's fees, and costs.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Section 50 vests the DAR with primary jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters. Section 3 defines "agrarian dispute."
*   **DARAB Rules of Procedure (1994):** Section 1, Rule II outlines DARAB's primary and exclusive jurisdiction.
*   **Vda. de Tangub v. Court of Appeals (191 SCRA 885):**  Clarifies the scope of DAR's jurisdiction.
*   **Monsanto v. Zerna (423 Phil. 150):** Affirmed the DARAB's jurisdiction over agrarian disputes.
*    **Nuesa v. Court of Appeals (428 Phil. 413, 423 (2002):** Reiterated the primary and exclusive jurisdiction of DARAB over agrarian disputes.
*   **David v. Rivera (464 Phil. 1006, 1016 (2004):** states the existence of agricultural tenancy relationship divests the MCTC of its jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Claims:**  The initial complaint and Salazar's defense presented conflicting versions of their relationship.
*   **Lack of Appeal by De Leon:** De Leon's failure to appeal the DARAB's decision finding Salazar to be a tenant has significant implications under *res judicata*.
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The DARAB decision in DARAB Case # II-380-ISA'94 held Salazar as the tenant. This decision became final.
*   **Agricultural Leasehold Contract:** Although the Court does not view this necessarily as a settlement, the court does take into account the fact that this is a written confirmation of the tenancy relationship.

**Conclusion:**

The SC found that the presence of a tenancy relationship between De Leon and Salazar, as evidenced by rental receipts and the final DARAB decision, established an agrarian dispute. This divests the RTC of jurisdiction, rendering its decision and the CA's affirmance null and void. The case highlights the importance of determining jurisdiction based on the nature of the dispute and the parties' relationship, particularly in agrarian contexts.
