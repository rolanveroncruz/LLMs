## Legal Document Summary: *Marciano Tan v. Philippine Commercial International Bank* (G.R. No. 152666)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Marciano Tan for nine counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. Blg. 22), the Bouncing Checks Law. The Supreme Court *reversed* the conviction, acquitting Tan.

**Key Facts:**

*   Master Tours and Travel (MTT), with Tan as executive vice-president, obtained a Usance Letter of Credit (LC) from PCIB for importing buses.
*   MTT issued postdated checks to PCIB as a condition for the LC.
*   The first six checks were honored, but the last was not due to a peso-dollar exchange differential demanded by PCIB.
*   MTT issued 14 postdated checks to cover the differential; nine of these were dishonored, leading to the B.P. Blg. 22 charges.
*   MTT surrendered the buses to PCIB pursuant to the Trust Receipts Law after suffering financial hardship, with the buses valued at P6.6 million.
*   PCIB demanded a further P10.3 million, leading to the criminal complaint when no payment was made.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Memorandum of Agreement:** Governs the terms of the LC, including the issuance of postdated checks by MTT. Potential ambiguity as to whether the MOA stipulated that there was adjustment of the obligations should there be foreign exchange fluctuations.
*   **Trust Receipts:** Governs the delivery of the buses to MTT, with PCIB as entruster and MTT as entrustee.  Provision 7 grants PCIB the right to repossess the buses upon default.
*   **B.P. Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law):** Criminalizes the issuance of checks with insufficient funds.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tan:** Initially convicted for the face value of the dishonored checks.
*   **MTT:** Potentially liable for any deficiency remaining after the sale of the repossessed buses.
* **PCIB:** Potentially liable for criminal offense with the malicious malpractice of presenting checks for payments even after amount has been fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Exchange Rate Differential:** No clear agreement on who bears the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.  Tan argued the agreement to pay the differential was a "mistake."
*   **Valuation of Repossessed Buses:**  The actual value realized by PCIB upon disposition of the buses is crucial. The court noted the estimated value significantly exceeded the amount of the dishonored checks. The fact that PCIB has failed to dispose of the buses prior to the date of the ruling shows bad faith.
*   **Application of Trust Receipts Law:** Proper application of proceeds from the repossessed buses to the debt.
*   **Full Payment Defense:**  The central issue revolves around whether the surrender and retention of the buses constituted full payment, extinguishing Tan's criminal liability under B.P. Blg. 22.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. Blg. 22):** The Bouncing Checks Law. Section 2 specifically details how the presumption of "evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds." Also that making arrangements with the drawee bank for the payment of the amount due within the five-day period from notice of the dishonor serves as a complete defense
*   **Trust Receipts Law:** Section 7 addresses the Entruster's (PCIB) rights upon default, including repossession and sale of the goods.
*   **Macalalag v. People:** Payment before presentment of the check.
*   **Griffith v. Court of Appeals:** Payment after the grace period but before the institution of the criminal case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Memorandum of Agreement lacks a stipulation about foreign exchange fluctuations.
*   The valuation of the repossessed buses is subjective and open to dispute.

**Supreme Court Reasoning:**

*   The prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Tan had the requisite knowledge of insufficient funds at the time of issuance, considering the buses had been surrendered and their value likely exceeded the outstanding debt.
*   PCIB "exacted its pound of flesh" by repossessing the buses, effectively satisfying the debt before the demand letter.
*   Penal statutes are construed strictly against the State and liberally in favor of the accused.
* The act of PCIB to retain the buses for unknown reasons and failure to sell shows bad faith that discredits the prosecution's case.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court acquitted Tan, finding that the surrender and retention of the buses by PCIB, with their estimated value exceeding the debt, effectively constituted payment prior to demand, precluding criminal liability under B.P. Blg. 22.
