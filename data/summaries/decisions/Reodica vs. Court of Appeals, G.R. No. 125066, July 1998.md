**Legal Document Summary: *Reodica v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125066, July 8, 1998***

**Nature:** Decision regarding reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property and slight physical injuries arising from a vehicular accident.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Factual Background:** The petitioner was charged with reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property (P8,542.00) and slight physical injuries after her vehicle collided with the complainant's car.

*   **Procedural History:** The RTC convicted the petitioner, which decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court reviewed the penalty imposed, jurisdiction, prescription and applicability of Article 48.

*   **Penalty Imposed:** The RTC sentenced the petitioner to 6 months of *arresto mayor*, and ordered payment of P13,542.00 (for car repairs and medical expenses). SC disagrees with both the petitioner and OSG, that the penalty of six months is correct, and their submission that the penalty of *arresto menor* in its maximum period is the proper penalty. Court ruled that the proper penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injuries is public censure, this being the penalty next lower in degree to *arresto menor*. Court ruled that, the imposable penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property to the extent of P8,542.00 would be *arresto mayor* in its minimum and medium periods, which could be anywhere from a minimum of 1 month and 1 day to a maximum of 4 months, at the discretion of the court

*   **Classification of Offenses:**
    *   Reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injuries - Light felony punishable by public censure only (RPC, Art. 9, para. 3).
    *   Reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property - Less grave felony punishable by *arresto mayor* in its minimum and medium periods (RPC, Art. 365).

*   **Complex Crime (RPC, Art. 48):** The Court ruled that a complex crime wasn't committed, since one of the offenses (slight physical injuries) is a light felony. Reference to *Lontok v. Gorgonio, 89 SCRA 632*. The two offenses should have been charged in separate informations.

*   **Duplicity of Information:** The information charged two offenses (reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property and reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injuries) in a single information. The petitioner waived this defect by failing to object to it via a motion to quash before pleading. *Section 3, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court*.

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court ruled that the RTC lacked jurisdiction. Since the penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property was *arresto mayor* in its minimum and medium periods and since the penalty for reckless imprudence resulting in slight physical injuries was public censure, jurisdiction lied with the Metropolitan Trial Courts (MeTCs), Municipal Trial Courts (MTCs), and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts (MCTCs). Reference to *Uy Chin Hua v. Dinglasan, 86 Phil. 617*.

*   **Prescription:** The Court ruled that the prescriptive period was tolled by the filing of the complaint with the fiscal's office. Reference to *People v. Cuaresma, 172 SCRA 415* and *Francisco v. Court of Appeals, 122 SCRA 538*. The court disagreed with the petitioner that Section 9 of the Rules of Summary Procedure controls.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, SET ASIDE the CA decision, and ORDERED the dismissal of Criminal Case No. 33919 due to the lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Regional Trial Court of Makati.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **No Double Jeopardy:** Despite the dismissal based on jurisdiction, the prosecution could theoretically file new charges with the proper court (MeTC, MTC, or MCTC) if the prescriptive periods have not expired.
