**Legal Document Summary: National Power Corporation v. Carlos Villamor (G.R. No. 160080, June 19, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) determination of just compensation in an eminent domain case.

**Facts:** National Power Corporation (NPC) expropriated land owned by Carlos Villamor in Cebu for its Leyte-Cebu Interconnection Project. NPC initially deposited an amount based on the assessed value. The dispute centered on the adequacy of just compensation. The RTC determined just compensation based on a Commissioners' Report, comparable sales, and compromise agreements. The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Eminent Domain Authority:** NPC, under RA 6395, has the power of eminent domain.
*   **Just Compensation:** The core issue is the proper valuation for just compensation. The RTC set this at P450/sqm, based on comparable sales, expert reports, and the location being within an industrial zone.

**Obligations:**

*   **NPC's Obligation:** To pay Villamor just compensation for the expropriated land and improvements.
* **Villamor's Obligation:** To transfer the expropriated lands to NPC after recieving just compensation for the property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NPC's Liability:** To pay just compensation as determined by the court. Failure to pay can lead to legal repercussions and potentially invalidating the expropriation.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **NPC's Argument for Easement Only (Section 3A RA 6395):** NPC argued that it was only acquiring an easement, thus liable for only 10% of the market value. This argument was rejected by the lower courts and the Supreme Court, citing the permanent nature of the transmission lines and towers and the resulting deprivation of the landowner's normal land use.
*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** The initial deposit was based on the assessed value, significantly lower than the ultimately determined just compensation.
*   **Intervenors' Claims (Siblings/Heirs):** While the main issue was valuation, the claims of intervenors (Villamor's siblings/heirs) regarding negotiation rights were noted. The Court of Appeals noted that this should be taken into consideration when paying.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Prior NPC Expropriation Cases:** The court emphasized that prior sales and compromise agreements in similar expropriation cases involving NPC in the same area were key factors in determining just compensation in this case. These prior agreements effectively set a precedent.
*   **Rejection of Section 3A RA 6395:** The Court cited prior cases where NPC's reliance on Section 3A (easement argument) was rejected, reiterating that the installation of transmission lines imposes a permanent limitation on the land.
*   ***The Province of Tayabas v. Perez, 66 Phil. 467 (1938):*** Cited to emphasize that the respondent is entitled to just compensation or the just and complete equivalent of the loss which the owner of the thing expropriated has to suffer by reason of the expropriation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6395 (NPC Charter):** The basis for NPC's power of eminent domain. Section 3A, which NPC attempted to use to limit compensation to easement value, was deemed inapplicable.
*   **Rule 67 Rules of Civil Procedure (Eminent Domain):** The procedural rules applicable to eminent domain proceedings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of the exact valuation date (the time when the landowner was notified).

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the landowner, upholding the lower courts' determination of just compensation based on comparable sales and the specific circumstances of the case. The key takeaway is that NPC cannot rely on a strict interpretation of Section 3A of its charter to avoid paying fair market value when the expropriation effectively deprives the landowner of substantial use and enjoyment of their property. The permanent nature of the infrastructure (transmission lines and towers) and the inherent dangers associated with them negate the argument that only an easement is being acquired.
