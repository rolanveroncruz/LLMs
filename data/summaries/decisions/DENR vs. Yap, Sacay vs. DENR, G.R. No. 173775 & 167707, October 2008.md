**Case Summary: *The Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources vs. Mayor Jose S. Yap, et al. & Dr. Orlando Sacay and Wilfredo Gelito, et al.***

**Citations:** 589 Phil. 156 (G.R. Nos. 167707 & 173775, October 8, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions. G.R. No. 167707 is a petition for review on certiorari of a CA decision affirming an RTC decision granting declaratory relief and ordering the survey of Boracay for titling purposes. G.R. No. 173775 is a petition for prohibition, mandamus, and nullification of Proclamation No. 1064, classifying Boracay into reserved forest and agricultural land.

**Key Issue:** Whether private claimants have a right to secure titles over their occupied portions of Boracay Island via judicial confirmation of imperfect title under Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA in G.R. No. 167707 and dismissed the petition in G.R. No. 173775, holding that the claimants are not entitled to judicial confirmation of imperfect title.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Regalian Doctrine:** The Court reiterated the Regalian Doctrine, stating that all lands not privately owned belong to the State. The burden of proof to overcome this presumption lies on the applicant.
*   **Classification of Public Lands:** Only the President, upon the recommendation of the DENR Secretary, has the authority to classify public lands into alienable/disposable, timber, and mineral lands (CA No. 141, Sec. 6).  *Director of Lands v. IAC* (G.R. No. 73246, March 2, 1993). A positive act of the government is needed to classify alienable and disposable lands.
*   **Prior Classifications:** The Court held that prior to Proclamation No. 1064, Boracay was unclassified land, and therefore considered public forest under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 705, making it inalienable. This trumps the presumption per *Ankron v. Government of the Philippine Islands* (40 Phil. 10 (1919)) relied upon by the claimants because the presumption in *Ankron*, that lands are agricultural lands, is no longer applicable because the courts no longer classify lands with the President having that authority.
*   **Proclamation No. 1801:** Declaring Boracay a tourist zone did not convert it to agricultural land or make it alienable and disposable. It merely designated the island for tourism and ecological purposes.
*   **Proclamation No. 1064:** Classifying portions of Boracay as agricultural land was a valid exercise of presidential authority. The reclassification does not violate Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) RA No. 6657 because Boracay had never been formally previously classified as a forest, and thus cannot be a "reclassification" as that term is used in RA No. 6657 Section 4(a).
*   **Requirements for Judicial Confirmation:** Claimants failed to prove the requirements for judicial confirmation of imperfect title under CA No. 141, specifically open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945 and prior to that, Boracay had not been classified as alienable and disposable. Tax declarations in the 1990s were insufficient to prove possession since 1945. *Republic v. Lao* (G.R. No. 150413, July 1, 2003).

**Obligations:**

*   Claimants need to adhere to the limitations of the Public Land Act and Property Registration Decree in acquiring titles.
*   DENR and other government agencies should respect existing vested rights when implementing Proclamation No. 1064.

**Liabilities:**

*   Claimants are ineligible for judicial confirmation of title. However, they may have a right to possess the lands and the government must respect this.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** The government can exercise its power of eminent domain over classified agricultural land subject to just compensation.
*   **Conflicting Claims:** The ruling may lead to further disputes and litigation regarding land ownership on Boracay.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of "vested rights" within the 628.96 hectares of agricultural land classified under Proclamation No. 1064 remains unclear, requiring further administrative or judicial clarification. The term vested right is not clearly defined in this ruling.

**Recommendations:**

*   Claimants should consult with legal counsel regarding alternative methods to obtain titles, such as homestead patents or sales patents, within the bounds of CA No. 141 and other related laws.
*   Claimants should lobby Congress to expedite the passage of House Bill No. 1109, or similar legislation, to specifically address titling issues on Boracay.
