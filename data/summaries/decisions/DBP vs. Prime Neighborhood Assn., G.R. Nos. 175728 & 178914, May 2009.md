Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Development Bank of the Philippines vs. Prime Neighborhood Association*, G.R. Nos. 175728 & 178914:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court consolidated two petitions filed by DBP seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decisions that (1) nullified the RTC's order for a writ of possession in favor of DBP and (2) affirmed the RTC's denial of DBP's motion for a demolition order. The core issue is whether the ex-parte writ of possession granted to DBP, as the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale, was properly issued given the claim of adverse possession by Prime Neighborhood Association (PNA).

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Mortgage & Foreclosure:** Y-Electric obtained a loan from DBP secured by a real estate mortgage.  Upon default, DBP extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage and purchased the property at public auction in 1977.  DBP consolidated title in 2000 and obtained new TCTs in 2003.
*   **Ex-Parte Writ of Possession:** DBP filed an ex-parte petition for a writ of possession in 2004, which the RTC granted.
*   **PNA's Opposition:** PNA opposed the writ, claiming ownership of the property via a Deed of Sale from Julian Tallano, alleging DBP's title was based on a spurious origin. PNA also asserted prior pending ejectment case filed versus DBP.
*   **CA Decisions:** The Court of Appeals sided with PNA, ruling that the RTC's obligation to issue an ex-parte writ ceases to be ministerial when a third party, like PNA, claims a right adverse to the mortgagor. The CA remanded the case to the RTC to determine if PNA was indeed in possession under a claim of adverse right. The CA also upheld the denial of DBP's demolition order.

**Key Legal Issues & Analysis:**

1.  **Ministerial Duty vs. Adverse Claim:**  The Court reiterates that while the issuance of a writ of possession to the purchaser after foreclosure is generally a ministerial duty under Section 7 of Act 3135, this duty ceases to be absolute when a third party claims adverse possession (citing *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals*, 424 Phil. 757 (2002)).
2.  **Third-Party Rights:** The Court emphasized the protection afforded to third parties in possession under a claim of right, referencing Article 433 of the Civil Code. Dispossession via an ex parte writ would violate due process and amount to summary ejectment. A separate action (e.g., ejectment or reivindicatory action) is required to determine ownership and the right to possess (citing *Dayot v. Shell Chemical Company (Phils.), Inc.*, G.R. No. 156542, 26 June 2007).
3.  **Nature of PNA's Claim:** The Court found that PNA's claim of ownership, derived from a source distinct from the mortgagor (Y-Electric) and asserted through a separate ejectment action, qualified as an adverse claim that must be adjudicated in a separate proceeding.
4.  **Collateral Attack:** DBP argued that PNA's claim of a "spurious title" constitutes a collateral attack. The Court did not explicitly rule on this point, but its overall decision suggests that while the validity of DBP's title cannot be directly attacked in the *ex parte* proceeding, the *bona fides* of PNA's claim needs to be addressed in a separate full-blown judicial action.
5.  **Distinction from *St. Dominic Corp. v. Intermediate Appellate Court***: DBP relied on *St. Dominic Corp.* (235 Phil. 582 (1987)) to argue that the PNA were mere intruders/squatters. The Court distinguished *St. Dominic*, noting that in that case, the third party's claim was based on mere occupancy and application for purchase, not an independent claim of ownership.
6.   **Suppletory Application of Rules of Court:** The court mentioned, "Under Section 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, which is made suppletory to the extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages by Section 6 of Act 3135, as amended, the possession of the mortgaged property may be awarded to a purchaser in the extrajudicial foreclosure unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor."

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED DBP's petitions. The CA decision nullifying the RTC's order for a writ of possession and affirming the denial of the demolition order was upheld.  The Court found that PNA was a third party claiming an adverse right, precluding DBP from obtaining possession through an ex parte writ.  The court deemed the CA's order to remand the case to the court a quo to determine whether PNA and its members are actually in possession of the property claiming a right adverse to that of the original mortgagor as unnecessary.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Need for Separate Action:** DBP must now initiate a separate action (e.g., ejectment, accion reivindicatoria) against PNA to establish its superior right to possession.  The success of this action is uncertain and will depend on the validity of DBP's title and the strength of PNA's claim.
*   **Delay and Costs:**  The legal process will be prolonged and expensive for DBP.
*   **Proof of Ownership:** DBP will need to definitively prove the validity of its title and overcome PNA's allegations of a "spurious origin."  Any weaknesses in DBP's chain of title could be fatal.
*   **Status Quo:** The legal process could mean PNA may be able to remain on the property for an extended period.
*   **Ambiguity regarding factual determination**: The factual determination of whether PNA and its members are actually in possession of the property claiming a right adverse to that of the original mortgagor will be essential to determine if PNA can be considered a third party with rights under law.
    *   **Legal References:** Act No. 3135, Article 433 of the Civil Code, Section 7 Act No. 3135
