## Legal Document Summary: *Mahawan v. People*, G.R. No. 176609 (2008)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Subject Matter:** Conviction for Frustrated Homicide and Plea of Self-Defense.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Fernando Estabas Mahawan (alias Pado) - Convicted of Frustrated Homicide
*   **Respondent:** People of the Philippines

**Facts:** Petitioner shot Diosdada Paradero, hitting her in the chest and other areas, causing serious injuries. The RTC convicted the Petitioner of Frustrated Homicide, rejecting his claim of self-defense. The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Self-Defense:** Petitioner claimed self-defense, alleging the victim attacked him with a knife first.  The Court emphasized the elements of self-defense: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the attack; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. The *sine qua non* is unlawful aggression (citing *People v. Arizala*, 375 Phil. 666 (1999)).
*   **Unlawful Aggression:** The Court found that Petitioner failed to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. The victim's testimony was deemed more credible and consistent. The superficiality of the injuries on the Petitioner did not demonstrate imminent peril to his life, unlike the serious gunshot wound of the victim. The court cited *Palaganas v. People*, G.R. No. 165483 (2006). The RTC found there was "insufficient evidence to determine who was the unlawful aggressor from the start".
*   **Reasonable Necessity:** The Court found that using a firearm was not a reasonably necessary means of repelling the alleged attack, especially considering the disparity in physical attributes and other less harmful options available.
*   **Lack of Provocation:** Court found that petitioner provoked the victim.
*   **Intent to Kill:** The Court found intent to kill based on the use of a lethal weapon, the location of the wounds (chest), and the serious nature of the injuries requiring multiple surgeries. The number of wounds is not the sole consideration, the court cited *People v. Delim*, 444 Phil. 430 (2003).
*   **Equipoise Doctrine:** The Court held that the equipoise doctrine (evidence evenly balanced) did not apply because the Petitioner admitted shooting the victim. The only issue was whether self-defense was applicable. The court cited *Vergara v. People*, G.R. No. 160328 (2005).
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual Damages:** The Court reduced the award of actual damages to P22,426.06, based on the receipts.
    *   **Temperate Damages:** The court replaced Actual Damages to Temperate Damages as it was the more appropriate remedy. Temperate damages was awarded in lieu of actual damages.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** The Court disallowed exemplary damages because no aggravating circumstances were alleged in the Information (citing *People v. Cachapero*, G.R. No. 153008 (2004)).
    *   **Unearned Income:** The Court upheld the award of P9,000.00 for unearned income based on the victim's testimony regarding her income from her store.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** The award of attorney's fees was upheld, as the victim incurred such expenses.
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The Court appreciated the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender because the petitioner had not been arrested, surrendered to a person in authority (a police officer), and the surrender was voluntary.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision with modifications.
*   The Court found the Petitioner guilty of Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 248 (Murder), 250 (Frustrated Homicide), 64(2) (Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances), 11 (Self-Defense).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari).
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applies to sentencing.
*   **Constitution:** Art. VIII, Sec. 14 (Requirement for stating legal basis in denying motions for reconsideration).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Standard:** The strict requirements for proving self-defense make it difficult for defendants to succeed with this defense.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The decision heavily relies on the assessment of witness credibility, which can be subjective.
*   **Damages:** Awards for damages, particularly unearned income, can be challenged based on the sufficiency of evidence.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Voluntary surrender was considered a mitigating circumstance, lowering the penalty.
*   **Sentencing:** The court modified the sentence of the petitioner.

**Ambiguities:**

*   None apparent.
