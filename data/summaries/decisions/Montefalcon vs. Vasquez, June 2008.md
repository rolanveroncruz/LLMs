Here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Dolores Montefalcon & Laurence Montefalcon v. Ronnie S. Vasquez* (G.R. No. 165016, June 17, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the RTC decision in an action for acknowledgment and support of an illegitimate child.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Filiation:**  The core issue is the filiation of Laurence Montefalcon with Ronnie S. Vasquez.  The RTC declared filiation based on Vasquez's signature on Laurence's birth certificate (a public document) and Vasquez's failure to answer the complaint, effectively admitting the allegations. Cites Article 172 and 175 of the Family Code.
*   **Support:**  The RTC ordered Vasquez to pay P5,000 monthly support, retroactive to June 1993, plus attorney's fees and litigation expenses. Cites Article 195(4) of the Family Code regarding the obligation of parents to support illegitimate children and Article 194 regarding the scope of support.
*   **Service of Summons:** The central legal issue is whether there was valid service of summons on Vasquez, establishing jurisdiction over his person. The RTC relied on substituted service at a Metro Manila address.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding the service defective.
*   **Residency of Seafarer:** Addresses the unique situation of an overseas seafarer, deeming the seafarer a resident temporarily out of the country, making substituted service a valid option. Cites Rule 14, Sections 15 and 16 of the Rules of Court regarding extraterritorial service and residents temporarily out of the Philippines.

**Obligations:**

*   The RTC ordered Vasquez to acknowledge Laurence as his illegitimate child.
*   The RTC imposed an obligation on Vasquez to provide monthly support.

**Liabilities:**

*   Vasquez was held liable for past and present support payments, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Substituted Service:** The primary point of contention and legal argument centers on the validity of the substituted service of summons.  The Court of Appeals found it defective. The Supreme Court, however, found the service to be valid, emphasizing the impracticability of personal service on a seafarer temporarily out of the country.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Supreme Court highlights the presumption of regularity in the performance of the sheriff's duty regarding service of summons (citing *Madrigal v. Court of Appeals* and Rule 131, Section 3(m) of the Rules of Court). Overcomes Vasquez's claims of lack of notice.
*   **Amount of Support:**  While the Supreme Court affirmed the P5,000 monthly support, it's subject to modification under Articles 201 and 202 of the Family Code based on changes in the recipient's needs or the obligor's resources.

**Statutory References:**

*   Family Code, Articles 172, 173, 175, 194, 195, 201, 202
*   Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 6, 7, 15, 16; Rule 131, Section 3(m)

**Case Law:**

*   *Montalban v. Maximo* (No. L-22997, March 15, 1968, 22 SCRA 1070):  Deals with substituted service on temporarily absent residents.  Cited extensively to support the validity of substituted service in this case.
*   *Mapa v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. Nos. 79374 & 82986, October 2, 1992, 214 SCRA 417): Addresses prior attempts at service
*   *Madrigal v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 129955, November 26, 1999, 319 SCRA 331): Reinforces presumption of regularity in performance of official duty.

**Ambiguity:**

*   While the Supreme Court ultimately upholds the substituted service, the initial finding by the Court of Appeals highlights the potential for ambiguity and challenges to the validity of such service, particularly regarding the documentation of prior attempts at personal service.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, and reinstated the RTC decision. The Supreme Court validated the substituted service of summons and affirmed Vasquez's obligation to acknowledge and support Laurence.
