## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Leon*, G.R. No. 214472

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Nova De Leon y Weves*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Holding:** Accused-appellant Nova De Leon acquitted due to reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody and comply with mandatory procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165, thus failing to prove the *corpus delicti* of the crime.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **Elements of the Crime:** The prosecution must prove the identity of the buyer and seller, the object (dangerous drug), the consideration (payment), the delivery of the drug, and the payment.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 Compliance (Chain of Custody):** The crux of the Supreme Court's decision hinges on the failure of the buy-bust team to strictly comply with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, concerning the custody and disposition of seized drugs. Specifically:
    *   **Immediate Inventory and Photographing:** Failed to immediately inventory and photograph the seized item at the place of seizure. The inventory was conducted at the Barangay Hall instead of the nearest police station without a valid explanation. *People v. Dahil*, 750 Phil. 212 (2015) emphasizes the need for immediate marking after seizure.
    *   **Presence of Required Witnesses:** Failed to ensure the presence of representatives from the media and the DOJ during the seizure, inventory, and photographing of the seized item. Only a Barangay Tanod was present. *People v. Tomawis*, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018, highlights the importance of these witnesses to prevent planting of evidence.
    *   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide sufficient justifiable grounds for the non-compliance with Section 21. The excuse of bad weather was considered "flimsy." *People v. Gamboa*, G.R. No. 233702, June 20, 2018, emphasizes that the prosecution must show earnest efforts to contact the required witnesses.
*   **Police Operational Procedures:** The buy-bust team also failed to follow internal procedures outlined in the 1999 Philippine National Police Drug Enforcement Manual.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving each element of the crime beyond reasonable doubt, including compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165. Failure to do so warrants acquittal.
*   **Police Duty:** Law enforcement officers are obligated to strictly adhere to the procedures outlined in RA 9165 and internal operational manuals to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs.
*   **Accountability of Police Officers:** The Supreme Court directed the National Police Commission to investigate the police officers involved in the operation, indicating potential disciplinary action for non-compliance with established procedures.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** The Court rejected the Court of Appeals' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, holding that it cannot prevail over the stronger presumption of innocence. *People v. Catalan*, 699 Phil. 603 (2012) warned against this pitfall.
*   **Fabricated Buy-Bust Operation:** The Court suggests the buy-bust operation may have been fabricated, highlighting the risk of abuse inherent in anti-narcotics operations and the importance of strict adherence to procedure.
*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** The absence of unbiased witnesses and unjustifiable deviations from the established procedures weakened the prosecution's case and raised doubts about the veracity of the events.
*   **"Planting" of Evidence:** Implicitly, the Court raises the concern of potential evidence planting, particularly due to the absence of mandatory witnesses, requiring extreme vigilance in drug cases.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a strong reminder of the crucial importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and related police operational procedures in drug cases. Failure to meticulously follow these procedures can result in the suppression of evidence and the acquittal of the accused, regardless of the underlying facts. The decision emphasizes that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot outweigh the presumption of innocence, and the prosecution bears the heavy burden of proving compliance with the law beyond reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court stresses the need for investigations and sanctions for police officers who fail to adhere to these vital legal safeguards.
