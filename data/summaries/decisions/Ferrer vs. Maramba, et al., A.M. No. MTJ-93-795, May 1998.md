**Legal Document Summary: Ferrer v. Maramba, A.M. No. MTJ-93-795 (1998)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Maramba, Branch Clerk Songcuan, and Process Server Abrogar of the Municipal Trial Court of Mangaldan, Pangasinan.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations:**
    *   Judge Maramba forced her to sign an affidavit of desistance in a grave oral defamation case against PO3 Eden.
    *   Judge instructed the clerk to deduct P5,000 from PO3 Eden's settlement payment for court costs and donation, implicating violation of Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
    *   Judge physically assaulted her by dragging her to her chambers, causing damage to clothing and jewelry.
    *   Process Server Abrogar allegedly threatened her family by misrepresenting a subpoena as an arrest warrant.
*   **Respondent's Denials (Judge Maramba):**
    *   Denied forcing the affidavit of desistance; claimed she simply advised complainant regarding the public prosecutor's conformity.
    *   Denied dragging the complainant.
    *   Admitted slapping the complainant, claiming self-defense.
    *   Denied instructing the clerk to deduct money from the settlement.
*   **Respondent's Denials (Clerk Songcuan):**
    *   Denied deducting any money from the settlement.
*   **Respondent's Denials (Process Server Abrogar):**
    *   Denied threatening or harassing the complainant or her family.

**Findings of Fact (Investigating Judge Belen):**

*   Found no evidence that complainant was forced to sign the Affidavit of Desistance.
*   Confirmed Judge Maramba used physical force, dragging complainant and slapping her.
*   Found no evidence of graft or corrupt practices by Judge Maramba or Branch Clerk Songcuan.
*   Found no evidence to sustain the claims of the complainant against Process Server Abrogar.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Maramba:** Violated the Code of Judicial Conduct by taking undue interest in the settlement of the case and engaging in physical assault and intemperate language.  Implicitly, she has an obligation to maintain judicial temperament and impartiality (citing Rules 1.01 and 2.01 of the Code of Judicial Conduct).
*   **Branch Clerk and Process Server:** No liability found due to lack of evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act:**  Alleged violation (ultimately unsubstantiated).
*   **Rule XIV, ยง23(n) of the Civil Service Rules:** Cited as the basis for the suspension penalty.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct:** Violated by Judge Maramba.  (Rules 1.01 and 2.01)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim:** Judge Maramba's claim of self-defense was rejected; slapping was deemed an inappropriate response. The factual determination of whether the complainant posed an actual threat is critical.
*   **Financial Impropriety:** Contradictory evidence regarding the settlement amount received by the complainant. The credibility of the complainant's altered document (Exhibit K-2) was questioned.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The primary risk is the erosion of public trust in the judiciary due to a judge's conduct unbecoming of the position.
*   Misinterpretation of self-defense leading to excessive use of force.
*   Allegations of corruption even if unproven can damage the integrity of the court and its officers.

**Ruling:**

*   Judge Maramba SUSPENDED for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay.
*   Charges against Branch Clerk Songcuan and Process Server Abrogar DISMISSED.
