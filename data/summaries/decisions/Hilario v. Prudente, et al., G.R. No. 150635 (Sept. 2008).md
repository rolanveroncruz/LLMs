## Legal Document Summary: *Dr. Rosalina G. Hilario vs. Modesto Prudente, Crisanto Prudente and Remedios Prudente-Puno* G.R. No. 150635

**Case Summary:** This case concerns a dispute over land covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Dr. Hilario (petitioner) filed a forcible entry case in the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) against the Prudentes (respondents), who were identified as potential CARP beneficiaries. The MTC ruled in favor of Dr. Hilario, but the Regional Trial Court (RTC) reversed, finding that the case involved an agrarian dispute under Section 50 of RA 6657, granting the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) exclusive original jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC decision. The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, denying Dr. Hilario's petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CARP Coverage:** The land in question was placed under CARP, triggering the identification of the respondents as potential farmer-beneficiaries.
*   **Jurisdiction:**  The core issue revolves around jurisdiction. Section 50 of RA 6657 grants the DAR primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform. This includes the identification of farmer-beneficiaries.
*   **DAR's Primary Jurisdiction:** Courts are precluded from resolving controversies falling under the DAR's jurisdiction due to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, effectively preventing the MTC from hearing the forcible entry case. The decision cites *Bautista v. Mag-isa Vda. de Villena* (G.R. No. 152564) on this point.

**Liabilities:**

*   The respondents are not currently liable for forcibly entering the land, as determined by the MTC's decision, because the MTC lacked the jurisdiction to make that determination.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Circumvention of Agrarian Reform:** The Supreme Court highlights the risk of using ejectment suits to circumvent CARP and frustrate the State's policy of social justice for landless farmers. Filing cases in courts without proper jurisdiciton to go against decisions of the DAR will likely fail.
*   **Conflicting Decisions:** The Court notes that a judgment in the forcible entry case (MTC) could render the DAR's decisions on farmer-beneficiary status useless, leading to absurd and conflicting outcomes.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Section 50 is the central provision conferring jurisdiction on the DAR.
*   **Executive Order No. 229:** Vested the DAR with quasi-judicial powers and jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters.
*   ***Bautista v. Mag-isa Vda. de Villena* (G.R. No. 152564):** Affirms the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in agrarian reform cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Tenancy Relationship:** The petitioner argued that no tenancy relationship existed, thereby implying that the case fell outside the scope of agrarian reform. However, the Court clarified that the existence of a tenancy relationship is not the sole determinant of DAR jurisdiction; the *implementation of CARP* itself is sufficient to trigger DAR's authority. This clarification effectively broadens the scope of cases subject to DAR jurisdiction.
*   **Good Faith Possession:** There is no mention of whether the identified beneficiaries had good faith possession of the property.
