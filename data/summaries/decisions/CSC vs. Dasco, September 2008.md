## Legal Document Summary: *Civil Service Commission v. Caridad S. Dasco* (A.M. No. P-07-2335)

**Nature:** Administrative case for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct against a court stenographer.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Core Issue:** Respondent, Caridad S. Dasco, is accused of using a spurious Career Service Professional Certificate of Eligibility. The CSC found inconsistencies between her appearance and signature on file (Picture Seat Plan) from the 1990 exam and her appearance/signature in 2005 when requesting authentication.
*   **CSC's Evidence:** Discrepancies between respondent's picture and signature on the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) and her identification card/Personal Data Sheet (PDS). CSC employees enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duty.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Claims discrepancies due to stress, fatigue, and a physical condition ("pasmado") affecting her handwriting. The Court found these claims unsubstantiated.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Re-docket case as a regular administrative matter.
*   **Court's Holding:** Respondent *guilty* of dishonesty. The court gives more weight to the inconsistencies in appearance and signature vis-Ã -vis her identification card.
*   **Reliance on Case Law:** The court explicitly applies the definition of dishonesty established in *Re: Spurious Certificate of Eligibility of Tessie G. Quires* and cites *CSC vs Cayobit, G.R.No. 145737, Sept. 3, 2003, 410 SCRA 357) .
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), and disqualification from reemployment in government service.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent had an obligation to be truthful and honest in obtaining and using her Career Service Professional Certificate of Eligibility.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The decision highlights the weakness of denial as a defense, especially without supporting evidence. The court holds the respondent to a high burden of proof to refute the CSC's evidence.
*   **Standard of Proof:** While administrative cases typically require only substantial evidence, the court emphasizes the seriousness of the offense and the high standards expected of judiciary employees, potentially elevating the scrutiny.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:** The court heavily relies on the presumption that CSC officials properly supervised the examinations.
*   **Discretionary Nature of Penalty:** The court had discretion in determining the penalty within the bounds of the Civil Service Rules.
*   **Subjective Assessment of Appearance and Signature Discrepancies:** The court relies on a "mere observation by the naked eye" to detect differences, which could be seen as subjective and open to challenge if the discrepancies were less blatant.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Service Rules (Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order 292) - defines dishonesty as a grave offense.
*   Code of Conduct for Court Personnel.
*   CSC Memorandum Circular No. 15, series of 1991.

**Conclusion:**

This decision highlights the severe consequences of dishonesty in the civil service, especially within the judiciary. It emphasizes the high burden on employees to prove their innocence when faced with allegations of misconduct. This case serves as a strong precedent for future cases involving fraudulent civil service eligibility.
