**Legal Document Summary: *Judge Nagamura T. Moner v. Datu Salem P. Ampatua*, A.M. No. SCC-98-3(P)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Datu Salem P. Ampatua, Interpreter I, Shari'a Circuit Court, Iligan City, for falsification of a public document and dishonesty.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Allegation:** Ampatua allegedly forged Judge Moner's signature on a letter to the Iligan City Mayor requesting authorization and funding to attend a PACE convention. He also allegedly forged the Clerk of Court's signature on a memorandum receipt.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Ampatua admitted signing the Judge's name, claiming he had implicit consent due to a prior agreement and the Judge's infrequent presence. He argued lack of bad faith and actual attendance at the convention.
*   **Investigating Judge's Findings (Judge Mangotara):**  Found Ampatua guilty of falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code, specifically paragraph 2, and of dishonesty and misconduct under Section 36 of Presidential Decree No. 807. Recommended a two-month suspension.
*   **Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) Recommendation:** Disagreed with the suspension and recommended *dismissal* from service with prejudice to re-employment in any government entity, asserting Ampatua's unfitness for government service.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Agreed with the OCA's recommendation of dismissal with prejudice, extending the ban to *all* branches/agencies of government, including GOCCs, *and* forfeiture of benefits. Cites Section 46, Chapter 7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292) and Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
*   **Rationale:** Forging the judge's signature constitutes gross dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, both grave offenses. The judiciary requires integrity and honesty from its employees, citing *Sy v. Academia, 198 SCRA 705, 718 [1991]*.
*   **Order:** Ampatua is dismissed from service with prejudice, and the Judge is directed to file criminal charges.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent had the obligation to act with honesty and integrity as a public servant, specifically in the Judiciary.
*   The Court Administrator has the obligation to ensure service of the decision on the respondent.
*   Complainant has obligation to file appropriate criminal charges against the respondent.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Dismissal from service with prejudice, including forfeiture of benefits and ineligibility for future government employment.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** Falsification of public documents under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The order to file criminal charges introduces the risk of criminal prosecution and conviction for falsification.
*   **Due Process:** While Ampatua had the opportunity to respond, the potential inadequacy of the initial investigation and the shift from suspension to dismissal might raise procedural due process concerns, potentially appealable.
*   **Fact-Finding Limitations:** The document relies heavily on the findings of the Investigating Judge. The extent of the evidence presented and the thoroughness of the investigation are crucial for a solid legal footing.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 171, Revised Penal Code:** Defines falsification of public documents.
*   **Section 36, Presidential Decree No. 807 (Civil Service Decree of the Philippines):** Addresses dishonesty and misconduct as grounds for disciplinary action.
*   **Section 46, Chapter 7, Subtitle A, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292):** Deals with disciplinary action for dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   **Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations:** Classifies offenses and penalties under the Civil Service Law.
*   **Sy v. Academia, 198 SCRA 705, 718 [1991]:** Reinforces the need for integrity and honesty within the Judiciary.
*   **Constitution, Article XI, Section 1:** States that public office is a public trust.

**Conclusion:** The case highlights the serious consequences of dishonesty within the judiciary. The Supreme Court unequivocally affirmed a zero-tolerance policy, resulting in Ampatua's dismissal and the directive for criminal prosecution. The decision underscores the high standards of integrity expected of all court employees.
