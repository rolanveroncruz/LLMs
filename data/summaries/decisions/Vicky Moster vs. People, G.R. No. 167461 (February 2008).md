Here's a legal summary of the *Moster v. People* case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Vicky Moster v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 167461, February 19, 2008 (569 Phil. 616)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Vicky Moster guilty of two counts of violating B.P. Blg. 22 (the Bouncing Checks Law). While the Court acknowledged that the prosecution established the issuance and dishonor of the checks, it found a lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt that Moster received the required notice of dishonor.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **B.P. Blg. 22, Section 1:** Penalizes the making and issuance of a check without sufficient funds, *knowing* that the funds are insufficient.
*   **B.P. Blg. 22, Section 2:** Establishes a *prima facie* presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds if the check is dishonored, BUT only arises *after* proof of receipt of written notice of dishonor and failure to pay or make arrangements within five banking days.
*   **B.P. Blg. 22, Section 3:** Drawee bank's duty to state the reason for dishonor. Dishonored check is *prima facie* evidence of issuance, presentment, and dishonor.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability (B.P. Blg. 22):** The Court acquitted Moster of criminal liability under B.P. Blg. 22 due to the prosecution's failure to prove receipt of the notice of dishonor beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Civil Liability:** Despite the acquittal, the Court ordered Moster to pay the face value of the three checks (P367,602) less any payments already made (P6,000), plus legal interest (12% per annum from the filing of the information until the finality of the decision, then 12% per annum thereafter), based on the principle that acquittal on reasonable doubt doesn't preclude civil damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Proper Authentication of Receipt:** The core issue was the insufficient proof of receipt of the notice of dishonor.  The mere presentation of the registry receipt and return card was deemed inadequate.  The prosecution failed to authenticate the signature on the return card or establish that it belonged to Moster or an authorized representative. This highlights the importance of meticulous evidence regarding service and receipt.
*   **Over-Reliance on Presumptions:** The prosecution relied heavily on the presumption of knowledge under Section 2 of B.P. Blg. 22, but failed to establish the *precondition* for that presumption to arise (i.e., proper proof of receipt of notice).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law)**: This is the central statute.
*   **Rico v. People, G.R. No. 137191, November 18, 2002, 392 SCRA 61:**  Cited regarding the need for authentication of receipts and that acquittal on reasonable doubt does not preclude civil damages.
*   **Cabrera v. People, G.R. No. 150618, July 24, 2003, 407 SCRA 247:** Emphasized the need to prove *actual receipt* of notice, not just that notice was sent.
*   **Ting v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 140665, November 13, 2000, 344 SCRA 551:** States that possibilities cannot replace proof beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **King v. People, G.R. No. 131540, December 2, 1999, 319 SCRA 654:** Burden of proof rests on the prosecution to prove each element of the crime.
*   **Magno v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 96132, June 26, 1992, 210 SCRA 471:**  Doubts are resolved in favor of the accused.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The prosecution's attempt to prove notice of dishonor relied on the January 14, 1997, letter and the registry receipt/return card.  The ambiguity lies in the lack of definitive proof that Moster (or someone authorized) actually received the letter.  The illegible signature on the return card was insufficient.

This summary highlights the critical issue of proving receipt of the notice of dishonor and the consequences of failing to meet the required burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.  It also reinforces the principle that civil liability can exist even in the absence of criminal culpability.
