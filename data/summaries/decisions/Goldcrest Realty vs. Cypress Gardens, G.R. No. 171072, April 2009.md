**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code (Easements):** Articles 625-627 outline the rights and limitations of the dominant estate owner (Goldcrest) in exercising an easement over the servient estate (common areas managed by Cypress).
*   **Case Law on Easements:** Discusses the limitations on the dominant estate's rights, prohibiting uses beyond the originally contemplated benefit, altering the easement, or making it more burdensome.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of "Exclusive Use":** The extent to which Goldcrest's "exclusive use" of the limited common area permits construction and leasing. The court definitively ruled that it does NOT permit constructing permanent structures.

**Summary of Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, requiring Goldcrest to remove structures obstructing common areas and the permanent structures on the roof deck's limited common area. The Court held that Goldcrest's actions exceeded the scope of the easement granted for exclusive use of the roof deck, constituted an illegal alteration of the condominium plan, and violated Section 22 of PD 957. The ruling emphasized the limitations on the dominant estate's rights in relation to the servient estate and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the condominium plan.
