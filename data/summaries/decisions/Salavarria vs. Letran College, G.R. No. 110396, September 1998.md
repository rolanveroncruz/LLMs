**Case Summary: Salavarria v. Letran College, G.R. No. 110396 (1998)**

**Facts:** Anita Salavarria, a high school teacher at Letran College, was dismissed for violating a school policy against illegal collections from students. The students initiated a project to collect contributions for religious articles, which Salavarria approved. She had previously been suspended for a similar offense. The Labor Arbiter initially ruled in her favor, but the NLRC reversed, finding just cause for dismissal but awarding separation pay.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **School Policy:** Letran College has a policy prohibiting illegal collections from students.
*   **Employee Obligation:** Employees, particularly teachers, are expected to uphold and abide by school policies.
*   **Employer's Right to Terminate:** Under Article 282 of the Labor Code, employers may terminate employees for just causes, including willful disobedience.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employee:** Salavarria was deemed liable for violating the school policy by approving the student-led collection, regardless of its origin.
*   **Employer:** Initially held liable for illegal dismissal by the Labor Arbiter. Ultimately, the NLRC found just cause for dismissal but ordered severance pay due to equity.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Willful Disobedience" Interpretation:** The application of "willful disobedience" under Article 282 of the Labor Code hinges on whether the school's order was reasonable, lawful, sufficiently known, and related to the employee's duties. The prior suspension makes this argument stronger for the school.
*   **Discretion in Penalty:** While the High School Council recommended a suspension, the Rector had the final authority to determine the penalty.
*   **Separation Pay Exception:** While termination for cause generally bars separation pay, this case highlights the "social justice" exception. The key risk is whether the infraction constitutes "serious misconduct" or reflects negatively on "moral character" (Santos v. NLRC, Camua v. NLRC). The court found it did not in this case, due to the limited nature of her participation and the lack of personal gain.

**Ambiguities and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The line between student-initiated activity and teacher endorsement can be blurry, creating ambiguity in applying the policy against illegal collections.
*   The determination of whether an infraction constitutes "serious misconduct" or reflects on "moral character" is subjective and fact-dependent.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   **For Salavarria:** The infraction was minor, student-led, and without personal benefit. Dismissal was a disproportionate penalty.
*   **For Letran College:** The prior suspension establishes knowledge of the policy, and Salavarria's approval constituted active participation, justifying dismissal.
