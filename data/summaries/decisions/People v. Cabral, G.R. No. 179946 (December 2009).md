**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cabral***

**Case:** G.R. No. 179946, December 23, 2009 (623 Phil. 809)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused-appellant for three counts of qualified rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Three counts of qualified rape under the Revised Penal Code, with qualifying circumstances of relationship (father-daughter) and minority of the victim (10-13 years old). The accused was originally charged with 5 counts, one count was dropped and another was acquitted.
*   **Facts:** Accused-appellant (father) was found guilty of raping his minor daughter on three separate occasions. The rapes occurred in the family dwelling, between 12 AM and 2 AM, while other family members were present. The accused-appellant used a balisong and threats to compel the victim to submit.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted the accused-appellant of four (4) counts of rape and sentenced him to death, one count was acquitted. The RTC found the complainant's testimony credible, "innocent, straightforward, and unflinching."
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's findings but acquitted the accused-appellant of one count due to lack of evidence of penetration. Modified the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* for each count due to RA 9346. Ordered payment of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA's conviction and modification of sentence. Modified the damages awarded.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused-appellant is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   Accused-appellant is obligated to pay the complainant P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages in each count of the rapes.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for qualified rape.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the commission of the crime.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Parole Ineligibility:**  RA 9346, Section 3 dictates that individuals sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* are ineligible for parole. This should be clearly conveyed to the client.
*   **Factual Challenges:** The accused denied the charges and presented alibi (work schedule as a tricycle driver and fisherman) and imputed ill motive on his wife and the complainant. However, the Court found the victimâ€™s testimony credible and consistent, and the physical evidence corroborated her claim.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The main argument of the appeal hinges on the credibility of the complainant's testimony, especially considering her failure to shout for help and the presence of other people in the house. The court addressed this by citing *People v. Cura, 310 Phil 237 (1995)* where it was ruled that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence** The CA acquitted the accused-appellant of one count of rape due to lack of evidence of penile penetration. This highlights the importance of proving each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Qualified Rape)**
*   **Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty)**
*   **Act No. 4180 (Indeterminate Sentence Law)**- Parole is not an option
*   *People v. Cura, 310 Phil 237 (1995)*:  Rape can occur even in crowded places.
*   *People v. Espino, Jr., G.R. No. 176742, June 17, 2008, 554 SCRA 682*: deference to trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   *People v. Mariano G.R. No. 168693, June 19, 2009*: Civil liability of the accused.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "impossibility" of the crime due to the small dwelling and presence of other occupants. The court dismissed this, emphasizing that "lust is no respecter of time and place." The accused's denial and alibi were deemed insufficient to overcome the complainant's testimony and the physical evidence.
