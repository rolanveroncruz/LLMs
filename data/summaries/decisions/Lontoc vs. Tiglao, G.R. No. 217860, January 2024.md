## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Lontoc v. Spouses Tiglao* (G.R. No. 217860)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals decision regarding a judicial foreclosure.

**Key Issue:** Compliance of a foreclosure judgment with Rule 68, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, specifically regarding the inclusion of the debt amount and period for payment, and the distinction between the right of redemption and the equity of redemption.

**Facts:** Spouses Tiglao initially sued Spouses Lontoc to nullify a deed of sale, which was declared an equitable mortgage by the RTC. The CA affirmed this, setting a PHP 300,000.00 redemption amount for the Spouses Tiglao. Upon their failure to pay, Spouses Lontoc filed a foreclosure suit. The RTC initially ruled in favor of foreclosure but failed to specify the amount due or the period for payment as required by Rule 68, Sec. 2. The Spouses Tiglao erroneously filed for a writ of execution, which was initially granted but later recalled. The CA reversed the RTC, ordering the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of the Spouses Tiglao, finding grave abuse of discretion.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition in part, reversed the CA decision, and AMENDED the RTC's foreclosure decision to include a monetary award to the Spouses Lontoc.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 68, Section 2, Rules of Court:** The judgment of foreclosure *must* specify the amount due (including principal, interest, charges, and costs) and order payment within 90-120 days from the entry of judgment. Failure to do so renders the judgment incomplete and inexecutable.
*   **Spouses Tiglao's Obligation:** To pay PHP 300,000.00 (principal amount as previously determined), plus legal interest of 6% per annum from the finality of the Amended Decision, plus PHP 60,000.00 as attorney's fees, and costs of the suit within 90 days of finality of the Amended Decision. The PHP 360,000 previously tendered is to be credited against this amount.
*   **Spouses Lontoc's Entitlement:** To receive the above-mentioned amounts. If Spouses Tiglao default, Spouses Lontoc are entitled to the proceeds from the public auction of the foreclosed property to satisfy the judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Tiglao:**  Liable for the monetary award, including interest and costs. Default will result in the sale of their property at public auction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** While the principal debt and attorney's fees are stated with sufficient clarity, a challenge could arise when calculating the precise amount of statutory interest.
*   **Right vs. Equity of Redemption:** The decision clarifies that the mortgagor only has an equity of redemption, not the right of redemption, as the mortgagee is not a bank. This means the ability to extinguish the mortgage prior to confirmation of sale.
*   **Time Limit:**  90-day period after the final judgement has been set, rather than a longer period previously. This tight period could challenge the mortgagee to redeem the property in time.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 68, Sections 2 & 3, Rules of Court:** Crucial for defining the requirements of a foreclosure judgment and the procedure for sale and possession.
*   **Rule 39, Sections 1 & 8, Rules of Court:**  Governs the execution of judgments, including the proper party to initiate execution and the required contents of a writ of execution (including interest).
*   ***Rodriguez v. Caoibes*, 62 Phil. 142 (1935) and *Philippine Trust Company v. Policarpio*, 139 Phil. 547 (1969):** These cases establish that a foreclosure judgment can be amended even after finality to comply with Rule 68, Sec. 2.
*   ***Limpin v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 248 Phil. 318 (1988):** Clarifies the distinction between the right of redemption and the equity of redemption in foreclosure.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Provides guidance on the imposition of legal interest.
*   ***AFP Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 417 Phil. 250 (2001):** Defines which party has the right to move for execution.
    **Rule 142 Section 1** Definition on "Judicial Costs"

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original RTC decision failed to include the amount and period for payment, rendering it incomplete.
*   The erroneous filing by the Spouses Tiglao for the issuance of the writ of execution.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court corrected the procedural errors of the lower courts and rendered a definitive judgment in compliance with Rule 68, Sec. 2. Spouses Tiglao are obligated to pay the specified amount within the specified period; failing which, the property will be sold at public auction. Spouses Lontoc, as the prevailing party, have the right to execute the judgment.
