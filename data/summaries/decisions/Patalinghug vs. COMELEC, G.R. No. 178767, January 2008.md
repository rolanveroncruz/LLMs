**Legal Document Summary: *Patalinghug vs. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 178767 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing COMELEC orders and resolutions related to pre-proclamation disputes in the 2007 Lapu-Lapu City local elections.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Norma Patalinghug et al., candidates for local positions.
*   **Respondents:** COMELEC, Arturo Radaza et al. (rival candidates), and City Board of Canvassers.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **COMELEC Actions Challenged:**
    *   May 25, 2007 Order directing the BOC to proclaim winning candidates.
    *   June 4, 2007 Resolution dismissing Pre-Proclamation Petition (SPC No. 07-011).
    *   June 28, 2007 Resolution No. 8212 (Omnibus Resolution) excluding Petitioners' cases (SPC Nos. 07-011 & 07-180) from the list of active pre-proclamation cases after June 30, 2007, pursuant to Section 16 of RA 7166.
    *   The inclusion of the ERs was questioned by the petitioners, but it was dismissed due to the appeals not being perfected.
    *   The COMELEC ruled the Petitioners had a fatal procedural error when they amended their petition to include objections to the inclusion of several ERs.

2.  **Petitioners' Arguments:**
    *   COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing their appeal in SPC No. 07-011.
    *   COMELEC erred in ordering proclamation of winning candidates in Ref. No. 07-028 (failed appeals).
    *   COMELEC committed grave abuse in issuing Resolution No. 8212.

3.  **Respondents' Arguments:**
    *   Resolution No. 8212 was an administrative act, not a quasi-judicial one, hence not reviewable by certiorari.
    *   Petition was filed beyond the 30-day period for certiorari.

4.  **Court's Ruling:**
    *   The Court held that Resolution No. 8212 *was* an exercise of COMELEC's quasi-judicial function under Section 16 of RA 7166 (determination of the merits of pre-proclamation cases).
    *   Certiorari under Rules 64 and 65 was the proper remedy. The Court acknowledged confusion surrounding the application of Section 16, R.A. No. 7166 and clarified guidelines.
    *   **However, the petition was DISMISSED** because Petitioners failed to demonstrate grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC in excluding their cases from the list of active pre-proclamation cases (no evidence presented to prove the cases were meritorious). The court noted that with the proclamation of the winning candidates, the question of whether the petition raised issues proper for a pre-proclamation controversy is already of no consequence, the more appropriate remedy being a regular election protest or a petition for quo warranto.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 16, Republic Act No. 7166:**  Governs pre-proclamation cases involving provincial, city, and municipal offices. The central point of contention revolves around the COMELEC's power to determine whether pre-proclamation proceedings should continue beyond the beginning of the term of office.
*   **Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881):** Cited in the petition regarding the inclusion of Election Returns, specifically Sections 243 (b), (c) and (d), and 214.
*   **Rules 64 and 65, Rules of Court:** Procedural rules for filing petitions for certiorari. The court clarifies the proper application of these rules in challenging COMELEC resolutions under Section 16, RA 7166.
*   **Section 3, Article IX-C of the 1987 Constitution** regarding COMELEC's ability to sit En Banc or in divisions.
*   **Santos v. Commission on Elections (G.R. No. 164439, January 23, 2006):** Addressed the issue of forum shopping related to challenging pre-proclamation cases.
*   **Navarro v. Commission on Elections, 444 Phil. 710 (2003)** Invoked by the COMELEC in ruling that the non-compliance by the board with the prescribed canvassing procedure was not an illegal proceeding, nor was there an illegal composition of the board.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "meritorious" under Section 16, RA 7166:**  The court's emphasis on the lack of evidence demonstrating the "meritorious" nature of the pre-proclamation cases highlights the risk for parties failing to adequately substantiate their claims before the COMELEC. This puts significant burden on the parties.
*   **Timing and Procedure:** The procedural complexities and the 30-day certiorari period remain a challenge. The Court laid out guidance to the bench and bar to avoid instances of confusion.
*   **Mootness due to Proclamation:**  The dismissal on the grounds that the case was moot due to the proclamation underscores the importance of diligently pursuing pre-proclamation remedies and the risk of losing the opportunity for judicial review once the proclamation occurs.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **COMELEC Obligation:** To fairly and judiciously determine whether pre-proclamation cases are "meritorious" based on evidence presented and to apply Section 16 of RA 7166 consistently.
*   **Petitioners' Liability:** Petitioners bear the burden of proving grave abuse of discretion on the part of COMELEC and demonstrating that their pre-proclamation cases are meritorious. The petitioners also need to adhere to the procedural requirements in the petition.
