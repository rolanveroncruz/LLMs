## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Misa* (G.R. No. 236838)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Zacarias Lesin Misa @ "Titing"* (G.R. No. 236838, October 1, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sections 5 & 11, Article II, RA 9165:** Define and penalize illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, respectively. Prosecution must prove all elements (buyer/seller identity, object, consideration, delivery & payment for Section 5; possession, lack of legal authorization, conscious possession for Section 11) beyond a reasonable doubt. *People v. Crispo* lays out the elements of the crimes.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Paramount importance in drug cases due to corpus delicti requirement. Prosecution must account for each link from seizure to court presentation to establish the identity and integrity of the drugs. *People v. Viterbo*.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) and its IRR:** Mandates immediate marking, physical inventory, and photography of seized items in the presence of the accused and certain witnesses: an elected public official and a representative of the NPS *or* the media (post RA 10640 amendment; previously, media *and* DOJ/NPS representative *and* any elected official). *People v. Bangalan* discusses the witness requirements.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a) IRR):** Allows non-strict compliance if (1) there's a justifiable ground for non-compliance, *and* (2) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. *People v. Almorfe*.  Prosecution bears the burden of proving both prongs. *People v. De Guzman.*

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of Chain of Custody:** Failure to properly establish the chain of custody can lead to acquittal, as it compromises the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Non-Compliance with Witness Requirement:** Failure to secure presence of mandated witnesses, absent justifiable grounds and documented diligent efforts to secure their presence, invalidates the seizure. *People v. Manansala.* *People v. Gamboa* notes that mere statements of unavailibility are insufficient.
*   **Prosecutorial Duty:** State has a *positive duty* to account for lapses in chain of custody, even if the defense doesn't raise it initially. *People v. Miranda.* Failure to do so can result in reversed convictions on appeal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):** The core statute.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1275 and RA 10071:** Define the role and structure of the National Prosecution Service.
*   **Relevant jurisprudence:** *People v. Crispo, People v. Viterbo, People v. Bangalan, People v. Almorfe, People v. De Guzman, People v. Manansala, People v. Gamboa, People v. Miranda, People v. Sumili, People v. Bio, People v. AÃ±o, People v. Sanchez, People v. Magsano, People v. Mamangon, People v. Umipang, People v. Segundo, People v. Macapundag, People v. Mendoza, People v. Mamalumpon, People v. Imson, People v. Ocfemia, People v. Resurreccion, People v. Tumulak, People v. Rollo*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" for Non-Compliance:** Requires specific evidence, not presumptions. What constitutes "genuine and sufficient efforts" to secure witnesses is fact-specific.
*   **"Reasonable Time" for Compliance:**  The court notes that the planning stage of a buy-bust operation should allow for compliance with Section 21, and it is unreasonable for officers to expect ready availibility of DOJ/media representatives at a moment's notice.
*   **24-hour Submission Deadline:** The court rejects this as justification for failure to secure required witnesses.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Misa. The court found the prosecution failed to establish a justifiable reason for the absence of an NPS/DOJ representative or media during the inventory and photography of the seized items, compromising the integrity and evidentiary value of the drugs. The officers' explanation of telephone lines being "always busy" was deemed insufficient. The Court emphasized the need for foresight and proper arrangements in buy-bust operations to comply with chain of custody requirements.
