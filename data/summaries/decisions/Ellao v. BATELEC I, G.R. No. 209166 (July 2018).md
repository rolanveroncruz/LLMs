## Legal Document Summary: *Demetrio Ellao y Dela Vega v. Batangas I Electric Cooperative, Inc.*, G.R. No. 209166 (2018)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Jurisdiction over an illegal dismissal complaint filed by the General Manager of an electric cooperative (BATELEC I).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision that the Regional Trial Court (RTC), not the Labor Arbiter/NLRC, has jurisdiction over the case.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central point hinges on whether the dispute is an intra-corporate controversy. The SC held it *is* because Ellao, as General Manager, is a corporate officer.
*   **Corporate Officer vs. Employee:** The SC applied the *Tabang v. NLRC* (334 Phil. 424 (1997)) distinction, emphasizing that corporate officers are created by the charter/by-laws and elected by directors/stockholders. Employees are hired by managing officers.
*   **Definition of a Cooperative:** The court referenced P.D. 269 and R.A. 9136 (EPIRA) and stated organization under PD 269 sufficiently vests upon electric cooperatives' juridical personality enjoying corporate powers..
*   **Definition of a Corporate Officer:** The court relied on *Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation, et al., v. Ricardo Coros* (647 Phil. 324, 342-343 (2010)) and *Guerrea v. Lezama* (103 Phil. 553, 555-556 (1958)), emphasizing a position *must* be expressly mentioned in the by-laws to qualify as a corporate office. The General Manager position *was* expressly provided for in BATELEC I's by-laws, per Article VI, Section 10.
*   **Intra-Corporate Controversy:** Ellao's complaint, therefore, falls under the ambit of an intra-cooperative controversy per *Celso F. Pascual, Sr. and Serafin Terencio v. Caniogan Credit and Development Cooperative* (764 Phil. 477 (2015)) as it involves a dispute between a cooperative officer and the Board of Directors.
*   **SEC Jurisdiction Transfer:** Citing R.A. 8799 (The Securities Regulation Code), the decision affirms that jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes previously held by the SEC now resides with the RTCs. The fact that Ellao filed his complaint *after* RA 8799 came into effect is crucial.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Ellao is obligated to refile his illegal dismissal claim in the appropriate forum (RTC).
*   BATELEC I's actions (termination) are not adjudicated on their merits in this decision, due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Corporate Officer" Definition:** The reliance on by-laws listing may create future disputes if a position's function, though not explicitly listed, functionally aligns with officer duties.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The decision hinges solely on jurisdiction, meaning BATELEC I may still face liability if Ellao succeeds in the RTC.
*   **Reliance on By-Laws:** The finding that the General Manager position is expressly within the by-laws is a key factual finding. Any challenge to the by-laws' validity or interpretation could impact this decision.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 269:** The founding legislation for the electric cooperative.
*   **Republic Act No. 9136 (EPIRA):** Defines electric cooperatives.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A:** Transferred jurisdiction to RTC.
*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (The Securities Regulation Code):** Transferred SEC's jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes to RTC.
*   **Corporation Code:** Section 25 (Corporate officers, quorum).
*   ***Tabang v. NLRC*** **(334 Phil. 424 (1997)):** Defines "officer" vs. "employee."
*   ***Matling Industrial and Commercial Corporation, et al., v. Ricardo Coros*** **(647 Phil. 324, 342-343 (2010)):** Requires positions to be expressly named in the by-laws to be considered as a corporate officer.
*   ***Celso F. Pascual, Sr. and Serafin Terencio v. Caniogan Credit and Development Cooperative*** **(764 Phil. 477 (2015)):** Relates officer's dismissal to conduct and management of affairs of a cooperative.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court focused on the technical definition of a "corporate officer" and strictly applied the requirement of express mention in the by-laws. This resulted in a jurisdictional shift from the labor tribunals to the RTC, requiring the claimant to refile his case. The merits of the illegal dismissal claim remain unadjudicated.
