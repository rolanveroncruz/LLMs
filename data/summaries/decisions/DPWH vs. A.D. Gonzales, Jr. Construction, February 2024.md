## Legal Document Summary - *Republic vs. A.D. Gonzales, Jr. Construction*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision awarding sum of money based on quantum meruit.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines (DPWH)
*   **Respondent:** A.D. Gonzales, Jr. Construction and Trading Company, Inc.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Two contracts between Gonzales Construction and DPWH: (1) Gumain Project (Rehabilitation of Gumain-Porac Division Channel) - PHP 2,695,980.00, and (2) Abacan Project (Abacan River Control Cut-Off Channel) - PHP 8,174,294.32.
*   Gonzales Construction alleges full performance but only received partial payment (PHP 1,178,252.42) for the Abacan Project.
*   DPWH raised defenses: sovereign immunity, lack of certification of funds (violation of P.D. 1445), contracts unsigned by Regional Director/DPWH Secretary, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Gonzales Construction, awarding PHP 5,364,086.35 for unpaid Abacan project work based on *quantum meruit*, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. No award for Gumain project due to lack of evidence.
*   CA affirmed RTC, deleting attorney's fees and costs and adding 6% interest from finality of decision.

**Obligations:**

*   **Gonzales Construction:** Undertook and allegedly completed construction projects as per contract terms.
*   **DPWH:** Obligation to pay for completed work.

**Liabilities:**

*   DPWH liable to pay Gonzales Construction PHP 5,364,086.35 plus 6% interest from July 17, 2014 until full payment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** DPWH argues lack of RTC jurisdiction, claiming COA has primary jurisdiction over money claims against the government based on Commonwealth Act No. 327, as amended by Section 26 of Presidential Decree No. 1445.
*   **Violation of P.D. 1445:** DPWH asserts the contract is void due to the lack of certification of available funds. *Quiwa* and *RG Cabrera Construction* are cited, which suggest that this absence does not necessarily preclude payment.
*   **Factual Dispute:** DPWH disputes the 90.61% completion rate of the Abacan project.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of signatures from appropriate DPWH authorities on the contracts.
*   Lack of formal certification of funds availability, triggering potential violation of P.D. 1445.
*   The determination of the exact amount due based on *quantum meruit* given the lack of a fully valid contract.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 1445 (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines):** Requires certification of funds for government contracts.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 327:** Grants COA primary jurisdiction over money claims against government.
*   **DPWH v. Quiwa:** Absence of certification of funds not a bar to recovery by contractor.
*   **R.G. Cabrera Construction v. DPWH and COA:** Similar to *Quiwa*; recovery allowed despite procedural flaws.
*   **Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. v. Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc.:** Established the latest guidelines in the imposition of interest.
*   **Philippine Commercial and International Bank v. William Golangco Construction Corp.:** The reckoning point for compensatory interest, when imposed on unliquidated claims, is set on the date of the judgment of the court.

**Analysis:**

The DPWH's arguments regarding jurisdiction and the lack of certification of funds are weakened by the cases of *Quiwa* and *RG Cabrera Construction*. The Court emphasized that the lack of certification of availability of funds does not bar a contractor from recovering the fees stipulated in the contract and it would be an injustice to deny compensation for work that benefited the public. The 90.61% completion rate is a factual finding affirmed by both the RTC and CA, making it difficult to overturn on appeal unless clear error is shown. The Court applied Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. and Philippine Commercial and International Bank case laws to determine the applicable interest rate and its reckoning date.
