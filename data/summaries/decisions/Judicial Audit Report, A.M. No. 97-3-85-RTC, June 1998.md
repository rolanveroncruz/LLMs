**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 97-3-85-RTC**

**Overview:** This is a Resolution of the Supreme Court regarding judicial audits conducted at RTC Branches 4 & 23 (Manila) and MeTC Branch 14 (Manila) following the compulsory retirements of Judges Reyes, Bayhon, and Salamanca respectively. The audit revealed significant deficiencies in case management, record-keeping, and compliance with the 90-day decision period.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Delayed Decisions:**  Judges Bayhon and Salamanca failed to decide numerous civil and criminal cases within the 90-day period mandated by Section 15(1), Article VIII of the Constitution and Canon 6 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics, Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Specific case numbers exceeding the deadline are enumerated.
*   **Inadequate Case Management/Record-Keeping:** Branch 23 (RTC) and Branch 14 (MeTC) exhibited ineffective case monitoring systems.  Docket books were inaccurate and incomplete, hindering the determination of pending case status. Clerks of Court failed to properly maintain records as required by Sections 7 & 8, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Missing Records:** Judge Salamanca retained records of seven (7) cases after retirement and claimed they were possibly lost or destroyed.
*   **Lack of Cooperation:**  Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 14 (MeTC) resisted the audit team's access to records in Judge Salamanca's chambers.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges Bayhon and Salamanca:** Held administratively liable for gross inefficiency and neglect of duty for failure to decide cases within the prescribed period. They were originally directed to explain their failure to act promptly on the cases and to update the records.
*   **Judge Salamanca:** Further liable for removing and retaining court records, potentially violating Section 14, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court and Article 226 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Clerks of Court (Branch 23 RTC and Branch 14 MeTC):** Ordered to show cause why no disciplinary action should be taken against them for failing to maintain proper records as prescribed by Rule 136, Rules of Court. Specifically, violation of Sections 7 and 8 of Rule 136.

**Penalties:**

*   Judge Bayhon fined P10,000.00.
*   Judge Salamanca fined P10,000.00 for inefficiency and neglect, plus an additional P10,000.00 for retaining court records.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 226, Revised Penal Code (Judge Salamanca):** Potential criminal liability for removing or concealing official documents, though the penalty imposed was administrative.
*   **Sufficiency of Explanation:**  The Court found Judge Bayhon's explanation (heavy workload as Executive Judge) insufficient justification for the delays.
*   **Cooperation with Audits:** The Resolution stresses the duty of court personnel to fully cooperate with judicial audits and the obligation of audit teams to report non-cooperation, setting a precedent for future audit proceedings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 15(1), Article VIII, Constitution:** 3-month deadline for lower court decisions.
*   **Canons 2, 6 and 31 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics:** Ethical obligations of judges to administer justice speedily and carefully.

*   **Administrative Matter No. R-465-MTJ, Nidua vs. Lazaro, June 29, 1989:** Proper and efficient court management is the judge's primary responsibility.
*   **Serafin Castillo vs. Judge Liberato C. Cortes, 234 SCRA 398:**  The Court will not tolerate the serious misconduct of a Judge nor will absolve him on account of the excuses he advanced.

**Conclusion:** This Resolution serves as a strong reminder to judges and court personnel of their duty to ensure the speedy and efficient administration of justice. It highlights the importance of proper case management, accurate record-keeping, and cooperation with judicial audits. The penalties imposed, while reduced due to mitigating circumstances, emphasize the seriousness with which the Court views these violations.
