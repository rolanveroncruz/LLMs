## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Marlon Roque and Anita G. Nunag*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-06-2200, *Office of the Court Administrator v. Marlon Roque and Anita G. Nunag* (Formerly OCA IPI No. 06-2-51-MTCC)

**Subject:** Administrative liability for Simple Neglect of Duty related to the mismanagement of court funds by a subordinate.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Respondents, Marlon Roque (former OIC) and Anita Nunag (Clerk of Court), were directed to explain their failure to exercise close supervision over financial transactions, monitor the activities of Cashier Lugue, and ensure timely remittance of collections, leading to delayed remittances and a significant shortage in the Fiduciary Fund (FF).
*   **Defense:** Roque and Nunag argued lack of accounting expertise, reliance on previous procedures, and absence of adverse COA findings as justification for their actions.
*   **OCA Finding:** Found respondents guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty due to failure to detect Cashier Lugue's "lapping technique." They lacked internal controls, over-relied on reports and audits, and failed to exercise due diligence.
*   **Holding:** Supreme Court adopted OCA's recommendation, finding Roque and Nunag guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty. Each was fined P5,000. Nunag was also admonished to improve internal controls.

**Obligations:** Clerks of Court are responsible for close monitoring of court funds, including strict adherence to accounting procedures to prevent misappropriation of funds.

**Liabilities:** Liable for any loss, shortage, destruction, or impairment of such funds and property. Simple Neglect of Duty is punishable by suspension or fine.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Subordinates:** Clerks of Court can't delegate their supervisory responsibilities or blindly trust subordinates. They must implement and enforce robust internal controls.
*   **Lack of Accounting Expertise:** Lack of formal accounting training is not a valid defense. Clerks of Court must acquire sufficient knowledge or seek expert assistance to properly manage court funds.
*   **Potential for Future Liability:** The admonishment given to Nunag emphasizes the need for proactive measures to strengthen internal controls. Failure to do so could result in more severe penalties for future infractions.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations:**  Governs penalties for Simple Neglect of Duty.
*   **A.M. No. P-05-2140:** Original case dismissing Cashier Lugue for dishonesty, which led to this investigation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The standard of "reasonable skill and diligence" is subjective and may be subject to interpretation based on the specific circumstances and resources available to the Clerk of Court.
