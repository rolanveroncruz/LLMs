## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Nazareno*, G.R. No. 167756

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Jerry Nazareno for rape of his two daughters, AAA and BBB.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Defective Information Argument Rejected:** The appellant argued that the Informations were defective for failing to state the precise dates of the commission of the offenses. The Supreme Court (SC) rejected this argument, citing *People v. Bugayong*, *People v. Gianan*, *People v. Salalima*, and *People v. Lizada*. The SC reasoned that the exact date is unnecessary unless time is an essential element of the offense, which it is not in rape. The Informations, specifying a range of dates, sufficiently informed the accused of the nature and cause of the accusations. *People v. Garcia* and *People v. Espejon* were cited to this end. Furthermore, the SC noted that this objection was raised for the first time on appeal, precluding consideration.
*   **Credibility of Victims:** The SC emphasized the importance of the victim's testimony in rape cases and deferred to the trial court's assessment of AAA and BBB's credibility. Citing cases that indicate no young girl would fabricate a story of defloration at the hands of her own father, or expose dishonor of the family, unless the crime were in fact committed.
*   **Weakness of Defense:** The defense of denial and alibi was deemed weak and insufficient to overcome the positive testimonies of the victims.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Jerry Nazareno):** Held liable for qualified rape. Original death sentence was downgraded to *reclusion perpetua* for each count due to R.A. No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty), however no parole eligibilty was granted. Must pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to each victim.
*   **State:** Obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt for each individual charge of rape.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Multiple Rape Conviction Reversed in Part:** The SC found that the lower courts erred in convicting the accused of multiple counts of rape. While the testimonies of the victims were deemed credible, the court ruled that only specific instances of rape were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically instances from 1990, March 25 1996, and January 1992. Citing *People v. Matugas* and *People v. De la Torre*, the SC emphasized that each charge of rape must be proven individually and with sufficient detail.
*   **Improper Charge for the December 6, 1998, Incident:** The SC pointed out that the December 6, 1998, incident involving digital penetration of victim BBB constituted rape by sexual assault under R.A. No. 8353. However, the accused was not charged under this provision, leading the SC to disregard that incident for sentencing purposes. This highlights a potential prosecutorial error.
*   **Retroactive Application of Procedural Rules:** The SC applied Sections 8 and 9 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure retroactively, benefiting the accused by disregarding the December 6, 1998, incident. This emphasizes the principle that procedural rules with retroactive application must favor the accused.
