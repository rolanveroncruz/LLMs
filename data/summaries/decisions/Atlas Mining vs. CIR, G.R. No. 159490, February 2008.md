**Case Summary: *Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue***

**Case Citation:** 569 Phil. 483 (G.R. No. 159490, February 18, 2008)

**Facts:** Atlas, a copper concentrate exporter, sought a tax credit certificate or VAT refund of PhP 7,907,662.53 for input taxes paid in the first quarter of 1993, arguing its export sales were zero-rated under Sec. 106(b) of the Tax Code. Atlas filed a petition for review with the CTA on February 22, 1995 to prevent the running of the prescriptive period under Sec. 230 of the Tax Code.

**Issue:** Whether Atlas sufficiently proved its entitlement to a tax credit or refund and whether it should have been accorded a new trial.

**Holding:** Petition denied; CA decision affirmed. Atlas failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim. A new trial was also correctly denied due to inexcusable negligence in failing to present required documentation during the initial trial.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 106(b) of the Tax Code (prior to NIRC amendment):** Governs VAT zero-rating for export sales. Petitioner bears the burden to establish entitlement.
*   **Sec. 230 of the Tax Code:** Governs prescriptive period.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The taxpayer (Atlas) has the burden of proving entitlement to a tax refund or credit. Tax refunds are construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer.
*   **Formal Offer of Evidence:** Under Sec. 34, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence (suppletorily applied), only evidence formally offered can be considered.
*   **Rule 37 of the Rules of Court:** Governs Motion for New Trial, requiring affidavits of merit for a new trial to be granted.
*   **Revenue Regulation (RR) 3-88:** Requires specific documentation to support VAT refund/credit claims on export sales. While Atlas argued this regulation applied only to administrative claims, the Court deemed compliance was necessary and that regulations promulgated under Sec. 245 (now Sec. 244 of the NIRC) carry the force of law.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atlas is liable for the unpaid taxes as its claim for refund was denied.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity Regarding Applicability of RR 3-88:** Atlas argued RR 3-88 was not applicable to judicial claims. While the Court ruled that compliance with the requirements was necessary, this argument could be revived in future cases where the evidence presented is deemed to be sufficient under other regulations and legal principles.
*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The case highlights the strict evidentiary standard for tax refunds, requiring primary evidence (invoices, receipts, export documents) rather than summaries or testimonial evidence alone.
*   **Application of *Strictissimi Juris*:** The court reiterated that tax refunds are in the nature of tax exemptions.
*   **Due Process:** The issue of denial of due process was raised as Atlas claimed it should have been given an opportunity to present the documents. The court ruled that it was Atlas' responsibility to ensure all the proofs were duly presented.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Eslao v. COA (G.R. No. 108310, September 1, 1994, 236 SCRA 161, 171):** Affirms the force of law of administrative regulations.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Solidbank Corp. (G.R. No. 148191, November 25, 2003, 416 SCRA 436, 461):**  Reiterates tax refunds are exemptions construed strictly against the taxpayer.
*   **Lagasca v. De Vera, 79 Phil. 376, 381 (1947):** Allegations alone don't constitute evidence.
*   **Sec. 245 (now Sec. 244 of the NIRC):** Gives Secretary of Finance the power to make Rules and Regulations.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability of RR 3-88 and the degree of compliance required for judicial tax refund claims. The court applied it retroactively.
*   The denial of a new trial, despite the argument that the CTA applied RR 3-88 to a judicial claim which Atlas argued only applies to administrative claims for refunds.
