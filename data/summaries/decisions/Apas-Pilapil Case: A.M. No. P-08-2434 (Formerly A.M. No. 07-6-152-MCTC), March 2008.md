**Summary of A.M. No. P-08-2434 (Formerly A.M. No. 07-6-152-MCTC)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Clerk of Court Marciana Apas-Pilapil (MCTC, Liloan, Cebu) for collection of transportation allowance (TA) without issuing a proper official receipt, in violation of Sec. 10(l), Rule 141 of the Rules of Court and Supreme Court Circular No. 26-97.

**Key Provisions & Obligations Violated:**

*   **Section 10(l), Rule 141:** Mandates a P1,000 deposit for travel expenses of court personnel serving processes. Requires submission of an estimated travel expense statement and subsequent liquidation. Pilapil collected P1,050 without adhering to this process.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 26-97:** Reaffirms Article VI of the Auditing and Accounting Manual, requiring the immediate issuance of official receipts for all payments received. Pilapil failed to issue a receipt for the collected TA.
*   **PD 1949 Section 1:** States the purpose of the Judiciary Development Fund as being for the benifit of the judiciary. Pilapil neglected to dutifully collect the exact fees for this fund.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Misconduct:** The Court found Pilapil guilty of simple misconduct, defined as a transgression of an established rule of action (citing *Vidallon-Magtolis v. Salud, A.M. No. CA-05-20-P, September 9, 2005, 469 SCRA 439, 469*).
*   **Fine:** Pilapil was fined P5,000.
*   **Warning:** A warning was issued that future similar offenses would be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Clear Intent:** While found guilty of simple misconduct, the decision acknowledges this is her first offense. A defense could have possibly argued a lack of clear corrupt intent, mitigating factors such as the alleged request from the process server, and her explanation, even if deemed inadequate.
*   **Discretion in Penalty:** The Court acknowledges the severity of the penalties usually prescribed but lessened her penalty in consideration of this being her first offense.
*   **Collection for Another Individual:** Pilapil claimed to have collected the TA at the request of the process server due to the latter's family relations with parties in the case. This raises concerns about the integrity of court funds and the potential for abuse.
*   **Trust Funds:** Court notes the JDF and Fiduciary Funds "partake of the nature of trust funds," citing *Re: Report of Acting Presiding Judge Wilfredo F. Herico on Missing Cash Bonds...* and *Re: Financial Audit on the Cash Accounts of Messrs. Rolando B. Saa and Benjamin Sevilla*. This underscores the high degree of responsibility expected of clerks of court.
*   **Inadequate Explanation:** The court dismissed Pilapil's explanation for not issuing a receipt.
*   **Lack of Account for Sheriffs Trust Fund:** Pilapil claimed to have no account for the Sheriffâ€™s Trust Fund.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 10(l) of the Rules of Court:** Sets the procedure for travel allowance deposits.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 26-97:** Reiteration of Article VI of the Auditing and Accounting Manual, requiring official receipts for payments.
*   **Section 22, Rule XIV of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292:** Defines simple misconduct and its corresponding penalties.
