## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ranido, G.R. Nos. 116450-51 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) joint decision convicting Leonides Ranido of two counts of rape.

**Holding:** RTC decision AFFIRMED with modification on damages. Appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of rape committed on October 7, 1992, and January 7, 1993.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by RA 4111.  Accusations involved force, intimidation (knife), and threats against a 14-year-old victim.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Testimony of complainant, her father, and the examining physician (Dr. Enopia). Medical certificate indicating old hymenal lacerations and fresh bloody discharge. While no spermatozoa was detected, the court notes the medical professional stated that the victim's menstruation could have washed away the discharged spermatozoa.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Denial by Appellant, supported by his common-law wife, Belencita Abejuela. The appellant claims he was only conversing with the victim. Abejuela testified on finding them together and becoming jealous.
*   **Trial Court Finding:** Conviction based on complainant's testimony, corroborating evidence, and implausibility of the appellant's alibi.  The trial court notes that, although the complainant was 15 years old at the time of trial, she only had the mental capacity of a fifth-grade student, thus she didn't possess the necessary discernment.
*   **Appeal Argument:** Appellant argued the prosecution's evidence was unconvincing and failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant contends the father's reaction (immediately seeking medical assistance for the daughter) was unnatural and implausible.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant has an obligation to serve two sentences of *reclusion perpetua* (subject to Art. 70 RPC maximum of 40 years) for each count of rape.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay P50,000.00 for each count of rape for a total indemnity of P100,000.00 to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for two counts of rape under Article 335 of the RPC, leading to imprisonment and other penalties.
*   Civil liability in the form of monetary damages payable to the victim.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Statutory References:** The applicable statute is Article 335 of the RPC as amended by RA 4111 (at the time of the crimes). Note potential later amendments (RA 7659) which would affect cases from December 31, 1993 onwards but do not affect this case.
*   **Ambiguity/Contentious Clauses:**
    *   Reliance on circumstantial evidence (lack of immediate spermatozoa detection) could be challenged, but the court accepted the physician's explanation.
    *   Credibility of witnesses (potential bias of common-law wife, alleged unnatural reaction of the father). The court addressed these issues, upholding the victim's credibility due to the lack of improper motive and the nature of rape as a crime usually committed in secrecy.
*   **Case Law:** The court cites *People v. De Guzman* and *People vs. Domingo* to emphasize that rape is essentially one committed in secrecy, and conviction may be based solely on the plausible testimony of the private complainant. The court cites many other sources when disputing the alibi of the Appellant, that the reaction of the Complainant's father was atypical, as well as when mentioning the standard for rape in general.
*   **Procedural Issue:** While the victim testified to six incidents, the Appellant was only charged with two. The Court affirms the conviction for only the two charges based on the constitutional right to be informed of the accusation.

**Overall Assessment:** The prosecution's case relies heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony. The Court found the evidence sufficient to prove the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because of the corroborating evidence, the unconvincing alibi, and the fact that she had no motivation to lie about the abuse. However, due to the constitutional right of the accused to be informed of the accusation, the Appellant can only be held liable for what he was charged with (two counts of rape).
