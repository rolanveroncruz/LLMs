Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document in markdown format, focusing on the key elements for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Nicanor D. Triol v. Atty. Delfin R. Agcaoili, Jr.*, A.C. No. 12011, June 26, 2018 (834 Phil. 154; 115 OG No. 6, 1192 (February 11, 2019))

**Nature:** Disciplinary Proceeding against a Lawyer (Disbarment Complaint)

**Holding:** Atty. Agcaoili found GUILTY of violating the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR). Suspended from practice for 2 years, prohibited from being commissioned as a notary public for 2 years, and notarial commission revoked (if any).

**Facts:**

*   Complainant alleged Atty. Agcaoili notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale for a property co-owned by him and his sister, conveying it to a third party (Fajardo), *without* their authorization, consent, or personal appearance.
*   Complainant also alleged the Community Tax Certificates on the deed were fake.
*   Atty. Agcaoili denied knowledge of the deed, claiming his signature was forged, and he wasn't a commissioned notary in Quezon City at the time.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule IV, Section 2(b):**  Prohibits notarization unless the signatory is personally present and known to the notary, or identified by competent evidence.  Violation found based on the fact that Complainant's sister resided in the U.S. at the time of notarization and could not have been present.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):**
    *   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Prohibits unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
    *   **Canon 10, Rule 10.01:**  Prohibits falsehoods and misleading the court. The misrepresentation as a commissioned notary public falls under this.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty to ensure signatories are present and properly identified before notarizing documents.
*   Duty to uphold the law and legal processes.
*   Duty to be candid and honest.

**Liabilities:**

*   Disciplinary action by the Supreme Court.
*   Suspension from the practice of law.
*   Disqualification from being a notary public.
*   Revocation of existing notarial commission (if any).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Forgery Defense:**  Atty. Agcaoili's defense of forgery was deemed insufficient because he failed to adequately substantiate it, specifically by not submitting a copy of his signature appearing in the records of the Office of the Clerk of Court or any other official document containing the same specimen signature to prove its genuineness and authenticity.
*   **Evidence:**  The Court relied heavily on Complainant's certification from the RTC Clerk of Court showing Atty. Agcaoili wasn't a commissioned notary.
*   **Tenoso v. Echanez (709 Phil. 1 (2013)):** The court cited this case to determine the penalty, which involved a lawyer performing notarial acts without the requisite commission.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule IV, Section 2(b).**
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 1, Rule 1.01; Canon 10, Rule 10.01.**
*   Relevant cases cited by the court for similar violations and penalties: *Dizon v. Cabucana, Jr.*, *Isenhardt v. Real*, *Bautista v. Bernabe*, *Gonzales v. Ramos*, *Japitana v. Parado*, *Re: Violation of Rules on Notarial Practice*, and notably, *Tenoso v. Echanez*.

**Key takeaway:**  The case reinforces the strict requirements for notarization and the serious consequences for lawyers who violate these rules and the CPR. Failure to properly verify the identity and presence of signatories, and misrepresenting one's notarial authority, can result in significant disciplinary action. The burden of proof lies heavily on the notary to demonstrate compliance with the rules.
