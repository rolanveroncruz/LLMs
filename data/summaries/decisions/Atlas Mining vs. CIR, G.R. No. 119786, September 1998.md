**Legal Document Summary: *Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Court of Tax Appeals and Court of Appeals*** (G.R. No. 119786, September 22, 1998)

**Nature:** Review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) denial of a tax refund/credit claim.

**Key Issue:** Computation of the 25% tax refund on specific taxes paid on petroleum products used in mining operations, as provided under Republic Act No. 1435, Section 5.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied Atlas' petition, affirming the CA decision. The SC held that the refund should be computed based on the specific tax rates *deemed paid* under Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435, *not* the increased rates actually paid under Sections 153 and 156 of the 1977 National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). The refund privilege was available until 1985.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 1435, Section 5:** Grants a 25% refund of specific taxes paid on oil products used by miners in their operations.
*   **NIRC (1977), Sections 153 & 156 (formerly Sections 142 and 145 of 1939 NIRC, amended by RA 1435 Sections 1 and 2):** Imposed specific taxes on manufactured oils and other fuels. These sections increased the rates of taxes paid by Atlas.
*   **Obligation of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR):** To process and grant refunds based on RA 1435, calculated using the rates under Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435.
*   **Obligation of Atlas:** Submission of proof of actual use of oils in mining operations.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Atlas' Liability:** Potential overpayment of taxes if a refund is not correctly calculated according to RA 1435.
*   **CIR's Liability:** Potential miscalculation of refunds. Exposure to litigation if the refund is calculated based on increased rates instead of Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435.
*   **Risk of Prescription:** Delay in filing refund claims could result in denial due to prescription.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Davao Gulf Lumber Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Court of Appeals (GR No. 117359, July 23, 1998):***  En banc decision reaffirming *Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation*. The Court held that the tax refund must be computed on the basis of the specific tax deemed paid under Sections 1 and 2 of RA 1435, not on the increased rates actually paid by the petitioners pursuant to Sections 153 and 156 of the NIRC.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Rio Tuba Nickel Mining Corporation (207 SCRA 549, March 25, 1992):***  Establishes that the refund privilege under RA 1435 was available until 1985 and that the computation should be based on RA 1435 rates.
*   ***Insular Lumber Co. v. Court of Appeals (104 SCRA 710, May 29, 1981):***  The authorized partial refund under Section 5 of R.A. No. 1435 partakes of the nature of a tax exemption and therefore cannot be allowed unless granted in the most explicit and categorical language.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Court of Appeals and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (Second Atlas Case, G.R. No. 106913):*** Held that Atlas should be granted the refund based on the rates specified by Sections 1 and 2 of R.A. No. 1435 and not on the increased rates under Sections 153 and 156 of the Tax Code of 1977, provided the claims are not yet barred by prescription.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation (First Atlas Case, GR No. 93631, November 12, 1990):*** Determines whether the claimant was entitled to the refund under Section 5, notwithstanding its failure to pay any additional tax under a municipal or city ordinance.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 1435:** An Act to Provide Means for Increasing the Highway Discretionary Funds, granting the refund privilege in Section 5.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 711:** Abolished all special and fiduciary funds.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Specifies the tax rates for manufactured oils and other fuels.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Computation Basis:** The crux of the case is the ambiguity regarding the computation of the refund â€“ whether it should be based on the original RA 1435 rates or the later, higher NIRC rates. The SC definitively resolves this in favor of the former.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision firmly establishes that refunds under RA 1435 are to be calculated using the rates specified in RA 1435 itself, regardless of subsequent increases in tax rates. The implications are that Atlas (and similarly situated entities) is not entitled to a refund based on the increased tax rates actually paid under the NIRC.  The case clarifies that the refund is a form of tax exemption which is strictly construed against the grantee.
