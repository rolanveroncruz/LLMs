## Legal Document Summary: *Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) Employees Union v. Commission on Audit (COA)*, G.R. No. 169815

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of COA Decision and Resolution upholding the disallowance of a P10,000.00 Food Basket Allowance granted to BFAR employees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Grant of Food Basket Allowance:** BFAR granted a P10,000.00 Food Basket Allowance to each of its 130 employees in 1999, citing the high cost of living and the Employees Suggestions and Incentive Awards System (ESIAS).
*   **COA Disallowance:** COA disallowed the allowance, citing:
    *   Sec. 15(d) of the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 1999 (R.A. No. 8745) prohibiting unauthorized allowances.
    *   Budget Circular No. 16 prohibiting unauthorized incentives.
    *   Sec. 12 of R.A. No. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law) - allowances are to be integrated into standardized salary rates.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments:**
    *   Constitutional mandate for social justice (Sections 9 & 10, Article II, 1987 Constitution).
    *   Undersecretary's approval tantamount to Presidential authority as an alter-ego.
    *   Conformity with Sec. 12 of the Salary Standardization Law as an "other additional compensation."
*   **Court Ruling:** Denied the petition, upholding the disallowance.

**Obligations:**

*   BFAR Employees Union has an obligation to reimburse the disallowed amount due to the unlawful disbursement of public funds.
*   BFAR must adhere to GAA restrictions and obtain proper authorization for allowances/incentives from the Office of the President or DBM.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for individuals involved in authorizing and receiving the unauthorized allowance. The exact scope of individual liability (extent of fault) will depend on COA determination, and may involve those who approved the disbursement and those who received the benefit in good faith.
*   Subject to applicable penalties for violating auditing rules and regulations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Disallowance:** COA will likely pursue recovery of the disallowed funds, which could involve legal action against responsible individuals.
*   **Precedent:** This case reinforces the strict interpretation of allowance provisions and the need for explicit authorization. It could negatively impact similar allowance schemes in other government agencies.
*   **Non-Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The Court noted BFAR failed to appeal to COA proper, rendering the initial disallowance final and executory. This is a significant procedural hurdle.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 8745 (GAA of 1999):** Sec. 15(d) prohibits unauthorized allowances.
*   **Budget Circular No. 16:** Prohibits unauthorized incentives/allowances.
*   **R.A. No. 6758 (Salary Standardization Law):** Sec. 12 consolidates allowances into standardized salaries.
*   **P.D. No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code):** Sections 48 and 51 re: appeal processes within COA and finality of decisions.
*   **P.D. No. 807 (Civil Service Decree):** Section 33 on Employee Suggestions and Incentive Award System.
*   **National Compensation Circular No. 59:** List of allowances deemed integrated into basic salary.
*   **Kilosbayan, Incorporated v. Morato:**  Constitutional social justice provisions are not self-executing.
*   **National Tobacco Administration v. Commission on Audit:** Interpretation of Sec. 12 of RA 6758 â€“ exceptions are reimbursements for expenses incurred in the line of duty
*   **Philippine Ports Authority v. Commission on Audit:** Interpretation of Sec. 12 of RA 6758 - Allowances are to avoid spending personal funds in the fulfillment of official duties

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Other additional compensation" (Sec. 12, R.A. 6758):**  BFAR argued the Food Basket Allowance fell under this category. The Court rejected this, stating it must be "in the nature of allowances similar to those enumerated," meaning for reimbursement of expenses incurred in the line of duty.
*   **Incentive award system (Sec. 33, P.D. 807):** The Court deemed the Food Basket Allowance not to be part of that, as it was granted indiscriminately and not based on individual merit/contribution.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the COA's disallowance of the Food Basket Allowance, emphasizing the need for express legal authority for such benefits. The court reinforced previous jurisprudence interpreting Section 12 of RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law) and the limitations on the power of department secretaries/undersecretaries to grant allowances without specific authorization from the President or the DBM. The non-exhaustion of administrative remedies added a finality to the disallowance.
