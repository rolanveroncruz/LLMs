## Legal Document Summary: *Pepsi Cola Products Philippines, Inc. v. Santos* (G.R. No. 165968)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Review of Court of Appeals Decision)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Pepsi Cola Products Philippines, Inc. and Ernesto F. Gochuico (Employer)
*   **Respondent:** Emmanuel V. Santos (Employee)

**Issue:** Validity of Employee's Dismissal, Necessity of Trial, and Propriety of Attorney's Fees Award.

**Facts:**

Santos (Employee) was dismissed by Pepsi (Employer) based on alleged fraudulent activities (falsifying records, breach of trust, fake invoicing, misappropriation, and serious misconduct/willful disobedience) under **Art. 282(a) of the Labor Code**. These charges stemmed from alleged artificial sales directed by Santos, resulting in significant financial damage to Pepsi. The Labor Arbiter initially dismissed the illegal dismissal case, but the NLRC remanded it for further proceedings. Subsequently, the Labor Arbiter found the dismissal illegal, awarding separation pay, backwages, moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The NLRC affirmed, but deleted the moral and exemplary damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the NLRC's decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the lower courts' finding of illegal dismissal, stating that the employer failed to meet the *onus probandi* to prove a valid cause for termination. The SC emphasized that Pepsi only presented the termination notice, lacking *substantial evidence* to prove Santos's guilt.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** The SC highlighted the absence of evidence, such as witness affidavits, to substantiate the charges against Santos.
*   **Discretion of Labor Arbiter:** The SC affirmed that the Labor Arbiter has discretion to resolve the case based on submitted pleadings and documents, without necessarily holding a trial on the merits. This satisfies due process requirements.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The SC *deleted* the award of attorney's fees. This decision was based on the NLRC's removal of moral and exemplary damages (no evidence of bad faith).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282(a) of the Labor Code:** This article lists the grounds for termination by the employer, specifically citing "Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The SC cited cases like *Amante v. Serwelas, Domondon v. National Labor Relations Commission,* and *R.P. Dinglasan Construction, Inc. v. Atienza* reiterating the appellate court's role as a reviewer of errors of law, emphasizing the deference accorded to factual findings of labor tribunals when supported by substantial evidence and are uniform.
* *CMP Federal Security Agency, Inc. v. NLRC* and *Shoppes Manila, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* affirmed the discretionary power of Labor Arbiters to decide based on submitted documents alone, satisfying due process.
* *Pascua v. NLRC* and *German Marine Agencies, Inc. v. NLRC* highlighted the requirement for bad faith in an illegal dismissal case to justify the award of attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary risk for the employer was failing to adequately document the allegations against the employee, relying solely on the termination notice. The burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases rests on the employer.
*   The fact that the investigation happened much later (almost a year after) affected the validity of the dismissal.

**Obligations:**

*   Employer obligation: Employer is obligated to pay separation pay and backwages.
*   Employee obligation: None.

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer Liability: Monetary liability for separation pay and backwages.

**Summary of Outcome:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, affirming the finding of illegal dismissal and the awards of separation pay and backwages. However, it deleted the award of attorney's fees. The decision emphasizes the employer's burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases and the importance of providing substantial evidence to justify termination.
