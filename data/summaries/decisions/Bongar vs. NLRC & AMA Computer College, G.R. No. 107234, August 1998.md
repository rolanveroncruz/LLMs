**Legal Document Summary: *Alfredo Bongar v. National Labor Relations Commission and AMA Computer College* (G.R. No. 107234, August 24, 1998)**

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court ruled that Alfredo Bongar, a college instructor, was illegally dismissed by AMA Computer College (AMA) after his teaching contract was not renewed. The Court found that Bongar had attained regular employee status despite AMA's attempts to classify him as a contractual or part-time employee to circumvent labor laws.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Regular Employment Status:** Court emphasized the importance of not allowing employers to use technicalities (e.g., repeated short-term contracts) to avoid regularizing employees who have served beyond the probationary period.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Bongar's termination based on contract expiration was deemed illegal, as he had served for a period warranting regular employee status. Termination due to student complaints was deemed unsubstantiated and lacking due process (no notice or hearing).
*   **Remedies for Illegal Dismissal:** The Court deviated from strict reinstatement, awarding separation pay and backwages, plus retirement benefits per CBA or Section 14, Book VI of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code.

**Liabilities of AMA:**

*   AMA is liable for separation pay calculated based on length of service, full backwages from the date of illegal dismissal, and retirement benefits.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Quantification of Retirement Benefits:** The specific amount of retirement benefits depends on the existence and terms of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) or, in its absence, Section 14, Book VI of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code. Determining the applicable basis for calculation could be contentious.
*   **"Strained Relations" Exception:** The Court declined to apply the "strained relations" exception to reinstatement, but this is often a fact-specific inquiry. Future employers might raise this argument based on different circumstances.
*   **Applicability of Retirement Section** the sec. 14 refers to retirement when an employee reaches 60 years or older. The case states that Bongar was in twilight years of his employment. The applicability of the retirement benfits pursuant to Section 14, Book VI of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code should be further examined.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The ruling underscores the importance of due process in termination cases, particularly the requirements of notice and hearing.
