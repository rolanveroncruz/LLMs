Okay, here's a legal summary of the document you provided:

**Case Name:** *Divinagracia, Jr. v. Commission on Elections and Centena* (G.R. NOS. 186007 & 186016, July 27, 2009)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for certiorari and prohibition challenging COMELEC Resolutions reversing an RTC decision in an election protest.  The dispute concerns the vice-mayoralty race in Calinog, Iloilo.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Election Protest:** Centena (private respondent) filed an election protest against Divinagracia (petitioner) with the RTC after Divinagracia was proclaimed vice-mayor. The protest alleged irregularities in the appreciation of marked ballots.
*   **RTC Decision:** RTC initially dismissed Centena's protest, citing a failure to overcome the presumption of regularity in the election.
*   **Appeals:** Both parties appealed to the COMELEC.
*   **Supervening Event:**  The duly elected mayor died, and Divinagracia assumed office as mayor.
*   **COMELEC Second Division Ruling:** The COMELEC reversed the RTC decision, declaring Centena the duly elected vice-mayor, citing fatal defects in the RTC's form, specifically, failure to indicate the specific markings in the contested ballots and merely discussed in a general manner the reasons why those ballots should not be declared as "marked.". The COMELEC re-appreciated the ballots.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Divinagracia filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that neither party paid the correct appeal fee under Section 3, Rule 40 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, and thus the COMELEC lacked jurisdiction.
*   **COMELEC En Banc Ruling:** The COMELEC affirmed its Second Division, invoking estoppel by laches against Divinagracia for failing to raise the jurisdictional issue earlier.
*   **Oath of Office:** Centena took his oath of office as vice-mayor, and then as mayor.

**Key Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdictional Question: Appeal Fees:** The central issue is whether the failure to pay the correct appeal fee deprives the COMELEC of jurisdiction over the appeal. Divinagracia argues that it does, citing COMELEC Rules. The Court examines jurisprudence on the payment of filing fees and appeal fees in election cases, tracing the evolution of the rules from *Loyola v. COMELEC* (337 Phil. 134 (1997)) onwards.
*   **Comelec Resolution No. 8486:** The Court emphasizes the COMELEC's clarification on appeal fee payments (Resolution No. 8486).  This requires payment of both the fee to the lower court per A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC *and* the fee to the COMELEC itself.
*   **Estoppel by Laches:** The Court upholds the COMELEC's application of estoppel by laches. Divinagracia actively participated in the proceedings, filing briefs and seeking relief from the COMELEC, before raising the jurisdictional issue.  The cases *Navarosa v. COMELEC* (458 Phil. 233 (2003)) and *Villagracia v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 168296, January 31, 2007, 513 SCRA 655) support this application of estoppel.
*   **Appreciation of Ballots:** The Court defers to the COMELEC's factual findings regarding the appreciation of ballots and the determination of "marked" ballots, absent grave abuse of discretion or jurisdictional error. The COMELEC found evidence *aliunde* to support its finding that the word "Ruby," "Ruby Lizardo," and its variants written on the ballots was a vote-buying strategy.
*   **Effect of Non-Payment of Fees:** The Court harmonized the rules on perfected appeals and payment of appeal fees, clarifying that  The non-payment or the insufficient payment of the additional appeal fee of P3,200.00 to the COMELEC Cash Division, in accordance with Rule 40, Section 3 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, does not affect the perfection of the appeal and does not result in outright or ipso facto dismissal of the appeal. Following, Rule 22, Section 9(a) of the COMELEC Rules, the appeal may be dismissed.
*   **Clean Hands Doctrine:** The Court notes Divinagracia's own failure to pay the appeal fee, rendering his challenge inequitable under the clean hands doctrine.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the COMELEC's Resolutions. The Court held that Divinagracia was estopped from raising the jurisdictional issue of unpaid appeal fees and deferred to the COMELEC's factual findings on the appreciation of ballots. The court declared that moving forward errors of non-payment or incomplete payment of appeal fees are no longer excusable.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of New Rules:** The application of COMELEC Resolution No. 8486, which clarified the appeal fee requirements, to cases already pending at the time of its issuance could be viewed as problematic from a fairness perspective.
*   **Impact on Future Cases:** The Court's declaration that "errors in the matter of non-payment or incomplete payment of the two appeal fees in election cases are no longer excusable" for notices of appeal filed after the decision sets a strict standard and increases the risk of dismissal for technical non-compliance.
*   **COMELEC discretion to allow or dismiss "perfected appeals"**: The case reinforces the discretion of COMELEC to dismiss cases based on payment issues.

This summary highlights the key legal arguments and provides context for evaluating the potential implications of this case.
