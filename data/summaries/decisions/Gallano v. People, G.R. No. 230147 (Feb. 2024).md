## Legal Document Summary: *Juanito Gallano y Obrar v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 230147)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming conviction for illegal possession and use of false treasury/bank notes (Art. 168 in relation to Art. 166, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the conviction, specifically regarding the element of *mens rea* (criminal intent).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner (Gallano) attempted to pay for a lotto ticket with a counterfeit PHP 1,000 bill.
*   Teller (Janoras) initially rejected it. After returning petitioner was apprehended.
*   Prosecution: Gallano knowingly used the counterfeit bill after being informed it was fake.
*   Defense: Gallano received the bill from his brother (Andres) and was unaware of its falsity, he came back to the booth to have the bill re-examined.
*   The BSP certified the bill as counterfeit.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Convicted Gallano. Found all elements of Art. 168 present, emphasizing Gallano's attempt to pay after being notified of the bill's counterfeit nature.
*   **CA:** Affirmed conviction with modified penalty (8 years and 1 day to 10 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *prision mayor*). Upheld RTC's finding regarding Gallano's knowledge and intent. Dismissed argument that the corpus delicti was not presented, finding that circumstantial evidence sufficed.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the CA decision and acquitted Gallano.
*   Art. 168 is a *mala in se* crime requiring both *actus reus* (the act) and *mens rea* (criminal intent/guilty mind). Knowledge of the counterfeit nature and intent to use are crucial elements.
*   SC found reasonable doubt regarding Gallano's *mens rea*. The Court found reliance on Arellano's testimonial declaration not credible as that testimony differed significantly from his affidavit.
*   Gallano's actions (returning to re-verify the bill) are inconsistent with someone knowingly using counterfeit money. The circumstances suggest good faith.
*   The prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Gallano knew the bill was fake and intended to use it.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 168, Revised Penal Code:** Criminalizes illegal possession and use of false treasury/bank notes. Requires knowing use or possession *with intent to use*.
*   **Art. 166, Revised Penal Code:** Defines the penalties for forging treasury/bank notes. Art. 168 imposes a penalty one degree lower.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioner was initially held liable for the offense defined in Art. 168 (and penalized in reference to Art. 166) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Ultimately, the Supreme Court absolved him of criminal liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of *Mens Rea*:** Establishing knowledge and intent is a critical element, often relying on circumstantial evidence. Inconsistencies in witness testimonies can significantly impact the outcome.
*   **Inconsistency of Affidavit with Testimony:** The SC focused on the inconsistency between Arellano's affidavit and his testimony, giving greater weight to the former given the circumstances.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Digoro (G.R. No. L-22032):** Possession of false treasury notes alone is not enough; intent to use must be proven.
*   **Clemente v. People (667 Phil. 515):** Failure to establish intent to use counterfeit bills led to acquittal.
*   **Tecson v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 113218):** Possession and offering to sell counterfeit notes demonstrated intent.
*   **Del Rosario v. People (G.R. No. L-16806):** Altering genuine treasury notes and selling them constituted a violation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Arts. 166 & 168:** Define the crime and penalties.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "intent to use" under Art. 168, especially when the evidence is primarily circumstantial.
*   The weight given to a complaining witness's testimony when it contradicts prior sworn statements, particularly when the testimony is crucial to proving the mens rea element of the crime.

**Summary for Legal Application:**

This case emphasizes the critical importance of proving *mens rea* in crimes *mala in se* like illegal possession and use of counterfeit money. The prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the money was fake and intended to use it. Mere possession is insufficient. Inconsistencies in witness statements, particularly where they relate to crucial elements of the crime, can create reasonable doubt and warrant acquittal. The Court prioritized the exculpatory elements of the prosecution's own evidence, and properly acquitted the accused due to the failure to establish his criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt.
