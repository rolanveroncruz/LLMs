**Case:** *Heirs of Salud Dizon Salamat vs. Natividad Dizon Tamayo*, G.R. No. 110644, October 30, 1998 (358 Phil. 797)

**Summary:** This is a Petition for Certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's ruling in a partition case involving the estate of Agustin Dizon. At issue is ownership of Lot 2557, claimed by respondent Natividad Dizon Tamayo based on an alleged oral donation from her father in 1936.  Petitioners (other heirs of Agustin Dizon) dispute this claim, arguing the lot should be part of the estate for partition.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Oral Donation:**  Natividad claims ownership based on an oral donation of land from her father in 1936.
*   **Art. 749, Civil Code:** The Court cites Art. 749 of the Civil Code, stating that donations of immovable property must be made in a public document to be valid. The oral donation is therefore invalid.
*   **Private Document of Conformity:** Natividad presented a private document purportedly signed by her brother Eduardo Dizon in 1936, attesting to the oral donation.
*   **Admissibility Issues:** The Court questioned the authenticity of this document due to unexplained erasures and alterations, failing the "ancient document" rule (Sec. 21, Rule 132, Rules of Court). The document appears to have been altered to change the year of execution from 1956 to 1936.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription:** While a void donation can be the basis of ownership through prescription, the Court found Natividad's possession was not adverse.
*   **Co-ownership:** As heirs, all parties are co-owners, creating a trustee relationship.  Possession by one co-owner is generally not adverse to other co-owners.  *Salvador v. Court of Appeals*, 243 SCRA 239 (1995) is cited.
*   **Repudiation Requirements:** For a co-owner's possession to become adverse, there must be unequivocal acts of repudiation communicated to the other co-owners, supported by clear and convincing evidence. These elements are missing.
*   **Tax Declaration:** The Court stated that tax declarations and realty tax payments are not conclusive evidence of ownership citing: *Rivera v. Court of Appeals*, 244 SCRA 218 (1995); *Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 224 SCRA 285 (1993); *Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 219 SCRA 339 (1993).
*   **Improvements:**  Art. 500 of the Civil Code governs accounting for benefits received and reimbursements for expenses made due to improvements on the land during partition.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The parties are obligated to participate in a partition of the estate of Agustin Dizon.
*   Natividad may be entitled to reimbursement for expenses made on improvements on the property, per Art. 500, Civil Code.
*   The heirs are liable to share equally in costs and expenses incurred for the partition.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Sales of Hereditary Rights:** The document mentions the sale of hereditary rights of Eduardo and Gaudencio to Salud Dizon Salamat, which could affect the partition.
*   **Assessment of Improvements:** Determining the value and reimbursing Natividad for improvements could be contentious. The court relies on Article 500 of the Civil Code.
*   **Partition process:** If the parties cannot agree, the Court will appoint commissioners per Rule 69, Sec. 3.
*   **Unclear document**: the document in support of Natividad is suspicious because of modifications made to it.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 749, Civil Code:** Donation of Immovables.
*   **Art. 500, Civil Code:** Accounting for Benefits and Reimbursements in Partition.
*   **Sec. 21, Rule 132, Rules of Court:** Ancient Document Rule.
*   **Rule 69, Rules of Court:** Partition of Real Estate.

**Case Law:**

*   *Salvador v. Court of Appeals*, 243 SCRA 239 (1995): Defines adverse possession by a co-owner.
*   *Pensador v. Pensador, 47 Phil 959 [1924]; Vda de Lima v. Tio 32 SCRA 516 [1970]; Consato v. Fruto, 129 US 182 [1889]; Solis vs. CA, 176 SCRA 678 [1968]*: Void donation may be a basis of ownership.
*   *Sotto v. Teves, 86 SCRA 155 [1978]*: Co-ownership creates a trust.
*   *Rivera v. Court of Appeals*, 244 SCRA 218 (1995); *Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 224 SCRA 285 (1993); *Director of Lands v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 219 SCRA 339 (1993): Tax declarations are not conclusive evidence of ownership.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision. Lot 2557 is declared part of the estate of Agustin Dizon, subject to partition. Natividad's claim based on the oral donation fails due to non-compliance with Art. 749, Civil Code and lack of proof of adverse possession. The partition must now proceed, taking into account potential reimbursements for improvements made by Natividad. The suspicious nature of the evidentiary documents used in the case has played a part in the Court's ruling.
