**Case Summary: *People v. Lantano*, G.R. No. 176734 (2008)**

This case involves the appeal of Jacinto Lantano, convicted of rape of his 14-year-old daughter, AAA, in violation of Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353, in relation to RA 7610 and RA 7659). The RTC initially sentenced Lantano to death, but the Court of Appeals modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, increasing the moral damages award.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rape under Art. 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, aggravated by minority of the victim (RA 7610) and relationship.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua* (modified from the initial death sentence due to RA 9346 abolishing the death penalty).
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity (₱75,000), exemplary damages (₱25,000), and moral damages (increased to ₱75,000).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Jacinto Lantano is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* and pay damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Reporting:** The main point of contention is the delay in reporting the rape. The Court, citing *People v. Tabugoca*, 349 Phil. 236 (1998) and related cases, stated that the delay was justified due to the threat by Lantano and the victim's fear.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** Lantano challenged AAA's credibility, pointing out inconsistencies. The Court cited established jurisprudence that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness credibility unless cogent reasons dictate otherwise.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Lantano presented an alibi, claiming he was at the river. The Court dismissed the alibi citing *People v. Melivo* and stating it was physically possible for Lantano to commit the crime.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 266-A and 266-B:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 8353:** Expands the definition of rape and reclassifies it as a crime against persons.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7610:** Provides special protection against child abuse, exploitation, and discrimination.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7659:** Imposed the death penalty on certain heinous crimes, later repealed by RA 9346.
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9346:** Abolishes the death penalty, leading to the modification of the original sentence.
*   ***People v. Tabugoca*, 349 Phil. 236 (1998):** Relevant to the admissibility of delayed testimony, particularly in rape cases.
*   ***People v. Melivo, 323 Phil. 412 (1996):*** Used to demonstrate the overwhelming fear that rape victims often experience as well as demonstrating the frailty of an alibi defense.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguous aspect is the interpretation of the circumstances surrounding the delay in reporting the crime. The defense argued the delay should cast doubt on the allegations, but the court relied on existing case law to justify it.
*   The defense argued that AAA was induced to lie by her maternal grandparents to obtain money that Lantano's wife sent home. The court dismissed this argument, but it could be used in future cases.

**Overall:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinged on the credibility of the victim's testimony and the failure of the defense to provide a convincing alibi. The decision reinforces the principle that delays in reporting rape, especially in incestuous rape cases, are often justified due to fear and intimidation. The court emphasized that the trial court is in the best position to assess witness credibility. The legal risks include upholding the conviction based on a potentially subjective assessment of credibility.
