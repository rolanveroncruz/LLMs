Okay, here's a legal summary of *Pahud v. Court of Appeals*, 613 Phil. 367, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Purita Pahud, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 160346, August 25, 2009.

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC decision in a case for judicial partition, involving a prior sale of undivided shares.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Pedro and Agatona San Agustin owned a parcel of land. After their death, their eight children inherited the land.
*   Three heirs, Eufemia, Ferdinand, and Raul executed a Deed of Absolute Sale of Undivided Shares in favor of the Pahuds. Eufemia also signed on behalf of Isabelita (with SPA), and Milagros, Minerva and Zenaida (without written authority).
*   The deed was not notarized.
*   Pahuds made payments for the property and to discharge a mortgage on it.
*   Virgilio, another heir, refused to sign an extrajudicial settlement.
*   Other heirs filed for judicial partition; a compromise agreement was drafted to sell to Virgilio, but not signed by Eufemiaâ€™s lawyer.
*   Virgilio received payment for the property and then sold it to the Belarminos, who began construction on the land.
*   Pahuds intervened in the partition case, claiming ownership. The RTC upheld the sale to the Pahuds. The CA reversed, finding the sale by Eufemia on behalf of those without written authority invalid.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Sale by Agent without Written Authority:** The central legal issue is whether the sale of the 3/8 shares of Zenaida, Milagros, and Minerva by Eufemia to the Pahuds is valid, given the lack of written authorization required by Article 1874 of the Civil Code. Art. 1874 provides that when a sale of land is through an agent, the authority of the agent shall be in writing, otherwise, the sale shall be void. Art. 1878 further necessitates a special power of attorney for the agent to enter into any contract by which ownership of an immovable property is transferred or acquired either gratuitously or for a valuable consideration.
*   **Ratification vs. Estoppel:** The Pahuds argued the sale was ratified by the subsequent execution of SPAs by the other heirs. The Court rejects ratification due to Article 1409 of the Civil Code, which deems contracts expressly prohibited or declared void by law as inexistent and void from the beginning. These contracts cannot be ratified, nor can the right to set up the defense of illegality be waived.
*   **Estoppel:** The Supreme Court, however, ultimately validates the sale of the 3/8 portion based on estoppel (Article 1431 of the Civil Code). The court finds that the silence and passivity of Zenaida, Milagros, and Minerva, in not challenging the sale to the Pahuds, induced the Pahuds to believe Eufemia had the authority to act on their behalf. This would prevent the 3 heirs from later disavowing the sale. The Supreme Court ruled that an agent is responsible for their principal's misrepresentation, whether the representation is authorized, within implied authority of the agent, or apparently authorized.
*   **Good Faith:** The Belarminos were deemed buyers in bad faith, based on several factors. They knew the property was still registered in the names of the deceased original owners and was subject to partition proceedings. As transferees *pendente lite*, they are bound by any judgment against their transferor (Virgilio).
*   **Nemo dat quod non habet:** The subsequent sale from 7 of the 8 heirs to Virgilio was deemed void since the 7 heirs no longer owned the property.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC decision with modification. The court held:

*   The sale by Eufemia to the Pahuds of the 7/8 portion is valid and enforceable, even regarding the 3/8 portion based on the principle of estoppel.
*   The sale from Virgilio to the Belarminos is valid *only* as to Virgilio's 1/8 share.
*   Ordered the trial court to proceed with the partition of the property, taking into account the Pahuds' ownership of 7/8 and the Belarminos' ownership of 1/8.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of Estoppel:** The application of estoppel to validate a sale rendered void by statute could be considered contentious. While the court highlights the conduct of the other heirs, the dissenting opinion argues that equity should not overrule positive law, and the law required written authorization to protect the interest of an unsuspecting owner and to caution the buyer of the agent's authority.
*   **Constructive Notice:** While the Court stresses the *pendente lite* status, it emphasizes factual knowledge of the conflicting claim. This could lead to uncertainty in future cases involving purchasers of real property under similar circumstances. The lack of written authority for Eufemia to represent all the heirs is a significant risk.
*   **Enforcement:** The partition will likely be complex and could lead to further disputes regarding the physical division of the property or the valuation for sale purposes.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Concurring/Dissenting Opinion:**

Justice Carpio Morales dissented in part, arguing that the sale to the Belarminos should have been valid with respect to 4/8 of the property (including the 3/8 for which Eufemia lacked written authority), and that estoppel should not be applied to contravene the law requiring written authority. She argued that any act or omission on the part of the three sisters that came after the fact could not retroact to the time of the previous sale as to consider the petitioners to have accordingly relied on such admission or representation before buying the property from Eufemia.
