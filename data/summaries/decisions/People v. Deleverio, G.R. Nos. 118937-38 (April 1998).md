## Legal Document Summary: People v. Deleverio, G.R. Nos. 118937-38, April 24, 1998

**Nature:** Automatic review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Jose Deleverio of two counts of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape, alleging forced carnal knowledge of Roxan Benarao (8 years old) on April 7, 1994 and May 13, 1994. The charges specifically allege force, threat, and intimidation, including pointing a knife at the victim.
*   **Accused:** Jose Deleverio, the step-grandfather of the victim.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented the testimony of the victim (Roxan), her mother (Susan Benarao), and a medical certificate indicating "old hymenal laceration" and loss of virginity. The defense presented Deleverio's denial and testimony from his wife (Maria Sarah) disputing the dates and alleging fabrication.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Found Deleverio guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts of rape and sentenced him to death for each count. The court also awarded P60,000.00 in moral damages.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty. The death sentences were reduced to *reclusion perpetua*. The award of moral damages was modified to an indemnity of P50,000.00 for each count of rape.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused's Liability:** Deleverio is criminally liable for two counts of rape. He is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* for each count and pay P50,000.00 indemnity to the victim for each count.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Child Witness:** The central issue revolved around the credibility of the victim's testimony. The defense argued inconsistencies and delay in reporting the incident raised doubt. The court gave credence to her testimony, citing her age and the circumstances surrounding the events.
*   **Application of RA 7659:** The trial court incorrectly applied RA 7659, which prescribes the death penalty when the victim is under 18 and the offender is a "parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim." The Supreme Court correctly determined that a step-grandparent does not fall within this enumeration (citing *People vs. Atop*, G.R. No. 124303-05, 10 February 1998).
*   **Moral Damages:** The Supreme Court determined that moral damages were not sufficiently proven and substituted them with an award for civil indemnity for the victim of rape.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659):** Defines rape and prescribes penalties.

**Case Law:**

*   **People vs. Atop, G.R. No. 124303-05, 10 February 1998:** Used to demonstrate that a common-law husband of a grandmother is not included within the relationships that trigger the death penalty under RA 7659.
*   **People vs. Francisco, 258 SCRA 558:** Affirms that conviction for rape is possible solely on the basis of a credible victim testimony.
*  **People vs. Robles, 170 SCRA 557:** Moral ascendancy and influence of the accused can explain the absence of an outcry from a victim.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention was whether the victim's testimony was credible given her age and the alleged inconsistencies. The defense argued that the delay in reporting and lack of outcry suggested fabrication. This was contested by the prosecution and ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court based on the trial court's assessment of the child's demeanor and forthrightness.
