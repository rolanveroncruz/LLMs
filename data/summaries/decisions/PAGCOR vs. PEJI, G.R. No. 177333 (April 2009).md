**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. Philippine Gaming Jurisdiction Incorporated (PEJI) and ZAMBOECOZONE Authority***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 177333, April 24, 2009 (604 Phil. 547; 106 OG No. 10, 1287 (March 8, 2010))

**Nature of Action:** Petition for Prohibition filed by PAGCOR

**Key Issue:** Whether the Zamboanga City Special Economic Zone Authority (ZAMBOECOZONE Authority) possesses the statutory authority under R.A. No. 7903, Section 7(f), to operate, license, or regulate games of chance within the ZAMBOECOZONE.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that R.A. No. 7903 does not grant the ZAMBOECOZONE Authority the power to operate and/or license games of chance/gambling.  The petition for prohibition was granted.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **R.A. No. 7903, Section 7(f):**  Authorizes ZAMBOECOZONE Authority to operate or license "tourism-related activities, including games, amusements, and recreational and sports facilities."  The Court strictly interpreted "games" and "amusement" according to their plain meaning, excluding "games of chance" and "gambling." The *verba legis* rule was applied.

*   **Contrast with R.A. No. 7227, R.A. No. 7922, and R.A. No. 7916:** The Court distinguished R.A. No. 7903 from these other ecozone laws which expressly grant the authority to operate/license games of chance to the relevant authorities (e.g., Cagayan Economic Zone Authority under R.A. No. 7922). The expressio unius est exclusio alterius doctrine may apply. The explicit inclusion of "gambling" and "casinos" in R.A. No. 7922, enacted one day after R.A. No. 7903, strengthens the argument that the legislature intentionally omitted such authorization from R.A. No. 7903.

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1869:**  PAGCOR's asserted exclusive authority to centralize and regulate games of chance under this law, vis-a-vis the specific powers granted to ecozones.

*   **Office of the President Opinion:** The Court gave persuasive weight to the Opinion of the Office of the President, which opined that ZAMBOECOZONE is not authorized to enter into any gaming activity unless expressly authorized by law. The Court invoked the doctrine of respect for administrative or practical construction.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **ZAMBOECOZONE Authority:**  Directed to cease and desist from operating, licensing, or regulating the operation of any games of chance.

*   **Philippine Gaming Jurisdiction, Incorporated (PEJI):** Directed to cease and desist from operating any games of chance pursuant to the license granted by ZAMBOECOZONE.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement:**  Potential challenges in enforcing the cease and desist order, particularly if PEJI attempts to argue that its operations fall under the definition of "games" or "amusements" that do not constitute "games of chance."

*   **Impact on ZAMBOECOZONE:**  The decision could negatively impact ZAMBOECOZONE's economic development if games of chance were envisioned as a significant revenue source.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   Mentioned the Plain Meaning Rule (National Food Authority (NFA) v. Masada Security Agency, Inc.)
*   Mentioned the doctrine of respect for administrative or practical construction(Asturias v. Commissioner of Customs)
