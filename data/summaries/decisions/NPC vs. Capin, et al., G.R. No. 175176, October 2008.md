**Case Summary: *National Power Corporation v. Santa Loro Vda. De Capin and Sps. Julito Quimco and Gloria Capin*, G.R. No. 175176, October 17, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's award of damages to respondents for land taken by NAPOCOR for its Leyte-Cebu Interconnection Project.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** NAPOCOR, pursuant to R.A. No. 6395 (as amended by P.D. No. 938), possesses the power of eminent domain and used it to construct transmission lines across the respondents' properties in Carmen, Cebu.
*   **Right of Way Easement:** NAPOCOR argues that it only acquired a right-of-way easement.  Respondents argue that the easement's restrictions constituted a *de facto* taking requiring just compensation for the full market value. Restrictions included prohibition of planting or building above 3 meters, and prohibition from quarrying for the Spouses Quimco.
*   **Permissions to Enter:**  Respondents granted NAPOCOR "Permission to Enter for Construction" based on representations of just compensation payments.  Initial payments were made, but significantly lower than what other landowners received (P8,015.90 and P5,350.49 respectively as opposed to 448.30 to 450.00 per square meter).
*   **Complaint:** Respondents filed for rescission of agreement, recovery of possession, removal of towers, damages, alleging disproportionate compensation.
*   **NAPOCOR's Defense:** NAPOCOR invoked Section 3-A of its Charter, limiting compensation for right-of-way easements to 10% of the market value (declared or assessed, whichever is lower).
*   **Summary Judgment:**  The RTC granted summary judgment for respondents, awarding damages of P448.33 per square meter. NAPOCOR failed to timely oppose the motion or provide evidence contradicting respondents' claims regarding the area taken and comparable land values.
*   **Comparable Sales (Civil Case No. DNA-379):** The RTC relied on a prior judgment in *National Power Corporation v. Heirs of Pedro D. Sepulva, Sr.* (DNA-379) that awarded P448.33 per square meter for similarly situated land.
*   **Interest Rate:**  RTC initially set 14% interest per annum from 1996, later modified to 6% per annum from filing of the complaint, and 12% per annum from finality of judgment.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **NAPOCOR's Obligation:**  To provide just compensation for the taking of private property for public use.
*   **NAPOCOR's Liability:**  The Court determined that the restrictions imposed constituted a *de facto* taking, making NAPOCOR liable for the fair market value of the land taken (P448.33/sqm), not merely an easement fee.
*   **Respondents' Rights:** Right to just compensation under the Constitution.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of Section 3-A of NAPOCOR's Charter:** NAPOCOR's reliance on its Charter to limit compensation to 10% of market value was deemed unconstitutional as it infringes on the judicial function of determining just compensation (Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay G.R. No. L-59603).
*   **Summary Judgment Appropriateness:** NAPOCOR argued against the summary judgement but failed to present contradictory evidence during proceedings.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** Determination of fair market value could be a point of contention. The Court relied on comparable sales but may not reflect unique characteristics of the specific property.
*   **Easement vs. Taking:** NAPOCOR's contention that it only acquired an easement of right of way was rejected, the court considered the actual impacts on the landowners and the land usage (National Power Corporation v. Gutierrez, G.R. No. 60077, 18 January 1991).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6395 (as amended by P.D. No. 938):**  NAPOCOR's Charter, defining its power of eminent domain and compensation guidelines.

*    **Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay, G.R. No. L-59603, 29 April 1987, 149 SCRA 305:**  Supreme Court ruled that it is violative of due process to deny to the owner the opportunity to prove that the valuation in the tax documents is unfair or wrong.
*   **National Power Corporation v. Aguirre-Paderanga, G.R. No. 155065, 28 July 2005:** Case highlighting the expropriation resulting from the restriction/limitation on property rights

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding NAPOCOR liable for just compensation based on the fair market value of the land taken, due to the restrictions imposed on the properties exceeding a simple right-of-way easement. The Court underscored the constitutional right to just compensation and rejected NAPOCOR's attempt to limit liability based on its Charter. This case serves as a precedent against undervaluing properties affected by easements when those easements effectively deprive landowners of substantial property rights.
