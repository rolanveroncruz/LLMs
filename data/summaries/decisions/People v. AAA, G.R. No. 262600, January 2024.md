## Legal Document Summary: People v. AAA (G.R. No. 262600)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming, with modification, the conviction of AAA for multiple counts of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A RPC:** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation, or when she is deprived of reason/unconscious, or by fraudulent machination/grave abuse of authority, or when she is under 12 or demented.
*   **Article 266-B RPC:** Defines qualified rape, including when the victim is under 18 and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, or common-law spouse of the parent.

**Facts:** AAA was charged with 24 counts of rape against his stepdaughter, BBB (15 years old at the time). The RTC convicted him of 7 counts, while the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction for 6 counts of rape but found him not guilty of qualified rape. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modification.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (AAA):** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of 6 counts of rape. Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count. Liable for civil indemnity (₱75,000), moral damages (₱75,000), and exemplary damages (₱75,000) for *each* count, totaling significant financial penalties. These damages bear interest at the legal rate of 6% per annum from the finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Qualifying Circumstance:** While the accused was referred to as a stepfather, the Court correctly found that the lack of a legal marriage between the accused and the victim's mother precluded a conviction for *qualified* rape. The Informations also did not allege their relationship as common-law spouses.
*   **Moral Ascendancy as Substitute for Force:** The Court relies on case law establishing moral ascendancy (due to the family relationship) as a substitute for physical force or intimidation. Defense counsel could argue about the extent of this ascendancy and whether the prosecution adequately proved it.
*   **Credibility of the Victim:** The Court emphasizes the credibility of the victim's testimony, particularly given that she is a minor. The defense challenged this by pointing out the delay in reporting the incident and claimed that she could have reported it to the authorities but did not.

**Ambiguities:**

*   **Extent of Moral Ascendancy:** While the court mentions a 13 year relationship between the accused and the victims mother, the term "moral ascendancy" is subjective. The absence of physical resistance also relies heavily on this principle.
*   **Inconsistency of Facts**: The trial court acquitted AAA of the charges in Criminal Case Nos. 264-M-2016, 272-M- 2016 to 287-M-2016. It is not mentioned if any of these crimes happened after or before the crimes AAA was ultimately found guilty of, it is important to note that there may be inconsistency of facts between the claims of the crimes he was found innocent of and the ones he was found guilty of that could invalidate the claims against AAA.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding AAA guilty of 6 counts of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.
