## Legal Document Summary - *Eriberto L. Venus vs. Hon. Aniano Desierto, et al.* (G.R. No. 130319, October 21, 1998)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision in a petition for prohibition under Rule 65, seeking to annul the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause and the Sandiganbayan's subsequent actions in a criminal case for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Eriberto L. Venus (former Municipal Mayor of New Washington, Aklan)
*   **Respondents:** Hon. Aniano Desierto (Ombudsman), Sandiganbayan (Third Division), Mars Regalado & Harry Abayon (private complainants/members of the Sangguniang Bayan)

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Petitioner, as Mayor, was authorized by the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) to negotiate with the Board of Liquidators (BOL) for the acquisition of a lot on behalf of the Municipality.
*   The BOL rejected the Municipality's offer. The SB was also not able to participate in the public bidding due to time and resource constraints.
*   Petitioner, at his personal expense, participated in the public bidding and acquired the lot in his name.
*   Private respondents (SB members) filed a complaint alleging violation of Section 3(h) of R.A. No. 3019. This was initially dismissed by the Deputy Ombudsman for the Visayas.
*   The Ombudsman disapproved the dismissal and directed investigation for potential violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.
*   The Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) subsequently filed an Information before the Sandiganbayan charging petitioner with violating Sec. 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 - causing undue injury to the Municipality through evident bad faith by acquiring the lot for himself, despite knowing it was needed by the Municipality.
*   The Sandiganbayan initially allowed the reconsideration which resulted in a Special Prosecutor initially suggesting dismissal due to lack of probable cause.
*   However, the Ombudsman reversed the recommendation and proceeded with the case.

**Obligations:**

*   The core issue is whether Petitioner violated Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019, requiring proof of (1) the accused is a public officer, (2) he committed the offense in relation to his office, (3) he caused undue injury to any party, and (4) such injury was caused through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner faced potential criminal liability under Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, potentially leading to imprisonment and disqualification from holding public office if convicted.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Evident Bad Faith:** The central contentious issue is whether the petitioner acted with "evident bad faith" in acquiring the property in his name. The Court notes that the Ombudsman improperly "passed the buck" to the Sandiganbayan regarding the finding of bad faith.
*   **Prima Facie Case:** The SC ultimately found no *prima facie* case against the petitioner, disagreeing with the Ombudsman's assessment.
*   **Harassment:** There is the risk of politically motivated prosecution, as the complaint was filed nearly four years after the events and after the petitioner lost an election.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e) and 3(h):** The core statutory basis of the charges against the petitioner. The court cites the elements required to establish the same.
*   **Marcelo v. Court of Appeals (235 SCRA 39 [1994]):** Cited regarding the court's deference to the prosecution's authority but ability to reassess the facts.
*   **Crespo v. Mogul (151 SCRA 462 [1987]):** Cited regarding the court's role in criminal prosecutions, namely, that courts cannot interfere with the prosecutor’s discretion as to and control over criminal prosecutions.
*   **Brocka v. Enrile (192 SCRA 183 [1990]):** Enumerated exceptions where courts can interfere with the prosecutor’s discretion.
*   **Ocampo v. Ombudsman (225 SCRA 725 [1993]):** The general rule providing the basis for non-interference with the Ombudsman.
*   **Young v. Office of the Ombudsman (228 SCRA 718 [1993]):** Court may interfere with the discretion of the Ombudsman in case of clear abuse of discretion.
*   **Domingo vs. Domingo, 42 SCRA 131):** Good faith is always presumed.
*   **Fernando v. Sandiganbayan (212 SCRA 680 [1992]):** The court can order dismissal in cases with no probable cause.
*   **Allado v. Diokno (232 SCRA 192 [1994]):** The court can order the dismissal of the case due to the absence of probable cause.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition for prohibition.
*   The Court found no reasonable ground to believe the petitioner violated Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.
*   The Sandiganbayan was **ORDERED** to dismiss Criminal Case No. 23332.
*   The temporary restraining order was made permanent.

**Dissenting Opinion (Vitug, J.):**

*   Argued against the Court's interference with the Ombudsman's prosecutorial powers.
*   Stressed the need to allow the Sandiganbayan to independently assess the evidence.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court intervened in this case due to the lack of a *prima facie* case against the petitioner. The court focused on the lack of "evident bad faith" and emphasized that the Ombudsman could not simply pass the burden of proving or disproving bad faith to the Sandiganbayan. The decision highlights the importance of a thorough preliminary investigation and the need to avoid politically motivated prosecutions. The key risk is that the Ombudsman continues with the cases despite the resolution.
