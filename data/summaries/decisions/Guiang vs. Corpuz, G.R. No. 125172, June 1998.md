## Legal Document Summary: Guiang v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125172 (1998)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the trial court's declaration of nullity of a Deed of Transfer of Rights and an Amicable Settlement involving conjugal property.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a sale of conjugal property by the husband without the wife's consent, and the effect of a subsequent "amicable settlement."

**Facts:** Judie Corpuz sold a portion of the conjugal property (residence and lot) to Spouses Guiang without his wife Gilda's knowledge or consent, while she was in Manila. Gilda filed a complaint to nullify the sale. Afterwards, Gilda signed an "amicable settlement" with the Guiangs at the barangay level regarding trespassing issues. The trial court declared the Deed of Transfer of Rights and the amicable settlement null and void. The CA affirmed.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding that the sale was **void** *ab initio* under Article 124 of the Family Code because of the lack of the wife's consent.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 124, Family Code:** Disposition or encumbrance of conjugal property requires the written consent of both spouses or court authority. Absence of such consent renders the disposition **void.**
*   The ruling establishes a clear distinction between the Family Code and the Civil Code, highlighting that under the Family Code, an alienation of conjugal property without the other spouse's consent is *void*, not merely *voidable*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Spouses Guiang liable to recognize Gilda Corpuz’s ownership of her one half of the conjugal property.
*   Gilda Corpuz is required to reimburse the Spouses Guiang ₱9,000 for payments made to Manuel Callejo and ₱379.62 for realty taxes.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Amicable Settlement:** The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the "amicable settlement" ratified the void sale, citing Article 1409 of the Civil Code, which prohibits ratification of contracts that are void or against the law. The Court also noted that there was no explicit offer and acceptance related to a sale within the settlement itself.
*   **Article 1390, Civil Code (Voidable Contracts):** The Court clarified that this article applies to instances where consent is vitiated but not entirely absent. Here, the wife's consent was absent, making Article 1390 inapplicable.
*   **Continuing Offer:** Court distinguished that this settlement was not a continuing offer.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 124:**  Key statutory basis for the ruling.  It outlines the requirement of spousal consent for dispositions of conjugal property.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1390:** Defines voidable contracts. The Court explicitly distinguishes this from situations where consent is *absent*.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1409 & 1422:** Used by the Trial Court, which were reinforced in the decision.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contentious issue was whether the "amicable settlement" had the effect of ratifying the original sale. The Court decisively ruled that it did not.

**Legal Advice:**

*   This case serves as a strong precedent emphasizing the requirement of spousal consent for the alienation of conjugal property under the Family Code. Lawyers should advise clients that contracts lacking such consent are void. The case also underscores that void contracts cannot be ratified and that a simple settlement agreement addressing possession issues doesn’t inherently ratify the sale.
