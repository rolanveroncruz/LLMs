**Case Summary: *Salic Mapandi y Dimaampao v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 200075, April 4, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal by certiorari from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (illegal sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu").

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Sec. 5, Art. II, R.A. 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs)
*   **Corpus Delicti & Chain of Custody:** The central issue is whether the prosecution adequately proved the *corpus delicti*, particularly the identity and integrity of the seized drugs through an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165:** The case hinges on compliance with the procedures outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR regarding the handling of seized drugs. This includes immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official. The RTC and CA relied on the saving clause in the IRR allowing for non-strict compliance under justifiable grounds.
*   **Marking:** Crucial issue regarding the marking of the seized drugs. PO2 Javier testified he marked the drugs with "HJ" at the police station, but documents (affidavit of apprehension, receipt of property seized, request for laboratory examination, chemistry report) reflected the marking "DEG-SDM-01-11-10-07." This discrepancy undermined the chain of custody.

**Obligations & Potential Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the crime, including the identity and integrity of the seized drugs through a documented and unbroken chain of custody (People v. Kamad, 624 Phil. 289 (2010)).
*   **Apprehending Officers' Obligations:** Strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its IRR is required. Failure to comply must be justified, and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items must be demonstrably preserved (People v. Cayas, 789 Phil. 70 (2016)).
*   **Liabilities of the Accused:** If convicted, Mapandi faces life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00, plus accessory penalties.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancies in Markings:** The conflicting evidence regarding the markings on the seized drugs raises serious questions about the chain of custody and potential for evidence tampering or switching (People v. Gonzales, 708 Phil. 121 (2013)).
*   **Lack of Insulating Witnesses:** Failure to present evidence of the presence of required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official) during the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs constitutes a procedural lapse that casts doubt on the integrity of the seizure.
*   **Over-Reliance on Saving Clause:** The lower courts' reliance on the "saving clause" in the IRR without proper justification for non-compliance with Section 21 is a point of contention. The Supreme Court emphasizes that the saving clause only operates when there are justifiable grounds for departure from the rule, and the integrity of the evidence is preserved.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 21:** Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs.
*   **IRR of R.A. No. 9165, Section 21(a):** Implementing Rules and Regulations.
*   **People v. Kamad, 624 Phil. 289 (2010):** Chain of custody requirements.
*   **People v. Gonzales, 708 Phil. 121 (2013):** Importance of marking seized drugs immediately.
*   **People v. Cayas, 789 Phil. 70 (2016):** Strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 is mandatory.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception within the saving clause of Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended. This clause has been heavily litigated in similar cases involving the chain of custody of seized illegal drugs.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and acquitted Mapandi due to the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the prosecution failed to show compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and with the chain of custody requirements, raising doubts about the identity and integrity of the drugs presented as evidence.
