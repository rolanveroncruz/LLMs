**Legal Document Summary: FBDC vs. Yllas Lending Corp. (G.R. No. 158997)**

**Subject:** Review of RTC Orders dismissing FBDC's third-party claim and denying intervention in a chattel mortgage foreclosure and replevin action filed by Yllas Lending Corp. against Tirreno, Inc.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Lease Contract (FBDC & Tirreno):**
    *   *Section 20 (Default):* Grants FBDC the right to terminate the lease upon Tirreno's default (failure to pay rent, etc.) with written notice, without need for judicial action. _Relevant Case Law:_ *Consing v. Jamandre* validating contractual termination clauses.
    *   *Section 22 (Lien):* Upon termination or expiration of the lease, FBDC has the right to retain possession of Tirreno's properties in the leased premises. FBDC is authorized to offset the properties' appraised value against unpaid rent/charges or sell the properties to third parties and apply the proceeds.
*   **Chattel Mortgage (Yllas Lending Corp. & Tirreno):**
    *   Tirreno granted Yllas Lending Corp. a chattel mortgage over furniture, fixtures, equipment, leasehold rights, and goodwill of its restaurant as security for a loan.
    *   Tirreno warranted it was the absolute owner of the properties, free from liens.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **FBDC:**
    *   **Risk:** Potential liability to Tirreno for wrongful appropriation of properties if Section 22 is deemed unenforceable.
    *   **Liability:**  Potentially liable to the Sheriff for damages for seizure of properties without an indemnity bond pursuant to Sec. 14, Rule 57.
*   **Yllas Lending Corp.:**
    *   **Risk:** Priority of FBDC's lien over its chattel mortgage if FBDC validly exercised its rights under Section 22 before the chattel mortgage was executed.
    *   **Risk:** Potentially liable to FBDC for damages resulting from wrongful seizure of properties.
*   **Tirreno:**
    *   **Liability:** Liability to both FBDC for unpaid rent/charges and to Yllas Lending Corp. for loan default.
*   **Sheriff:**
    *   **Liability:**  Potential liability to FBDC for seizing and delivering properties without an indemnity bond.

**Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Validity of Section 22 (Lease Contract):**
    *   **Yllas' Argument:** Section 22 is a *pactum commissorium* (prohibited under Article 2088 of the Civil Code) because it allows FBDC to automatically appropriate Tirreno's properties, rendering it void.
    *   **FBDC's Argument:** Section 22 is a valid forfeiture clause and/or *dacion en pago* (Article 1245 of the Civil Code), providing a contractual remedy for Tirreno's default.
*   **Propriety of Intervention:**
    *   **Yllas' Argument:** FBDC's remedy is a separate action, not intervention. _Relevant Case Law:_ *Bayer Phils. v. Agana*.
    *   **FBDC's Argument:** Intervention is proper under Rule 19, Section 1, because FBDC has a legal interest in the properties and will be adversely affected by their disposition. FBDC exercised its lien to Tirreno's properties even before respondents and Tirreno executed their Deed of Chattel Mortgage.

* Country Bankers Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals upholding the validity of a forfeiture clause
* BA Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals where the mortgagee's right to possession is put to great doubt, as when a contending party might contest the legal bases for mortgagee's cause of action or an adverse and independent claim of ownership or right of possession is raised by the contending party, it could become essential to have other persons involved and accordingly impleaded for a complete determination and resolution of the controversy.

*   Philippine National Bank v. Pineda
**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the RTC Orders, finding that Section 22 is not a *pactum commissorium*. It allows FBDCâ€™s intervention and reinstates its third-party claim. The Supreme Court held that FBDC exercised its lien over Tirreno's properties before the chattel mortgage and that the absence of an indemnity bond makes the sheriff liable.

**Ambiguous Areas:**

*   The precise valuation of Tirreno's properties and the extent to which FBDC's lien covers them will need to be determined.
*   The actual date when FBDC took possession of the properties relative to the date of execution of the chattel mortgage is critical in determining priority of rights.
