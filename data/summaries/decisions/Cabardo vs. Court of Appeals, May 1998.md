**Legal Document Summary: Cabardo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118202, May 19, 1998 (352 Phil. 739)**

**Case Overview:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari regarding liability for damages arising from a vehicular accident on the South Luzon Expressway. The central issue is whether private respondent Rodil's negligence was the proximate cause of petitioner Cabardo's injuries.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accident Sequence:** A truck-tanker driven by Peralta (CIGI employee) overturned. Subsequently, Rodil's car crashed into the overturned truck. Cabardo, Peralta's helper, sustained injuries.
*   **Conflicting Claims:** Cabardo claims Rodil's negligent driving (excessive speed in heavy rain) caused his injuries after he exited the truck. Rodil argues Cabardo's injuries resulted from the initial truck accident.
*   **Prior Actions:** Rodil filed a separate action (Civil Case No. SC-2559) against CIGI and Peralta. Cabardo filed this action (Civil Case No. 639-M-89) against Rodil. The Santa Cruz Court found CIGI and Peralta negligent and Rodil contributorily negligent.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The Regional Trial Court (Malolos) found Rodil liable, concluding his reckless driving was the proximate cause of Cabardo's injuries. Damages were awarded.
*   **CA Reversal:** The Court of Appeals reversed, citing inconsistencies in the testimonies of Cabardo and Peralta regarding the accident sequence.
*   **SC Reversal:** Supreme Court REVERSED the CA decision and REINSTATED the RTC decision in favor of Cabardo.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Rodil's Negligence:** The Supreme Court agreed with the RTC that Rodil was negligent in driving too fast in poor visibility, constituting a breach of duty of care to other drivers and people on the expressway.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The Supreme Court found sufficient evidence that Rodil's negligence caused Cabardo's injuries.
*   **Damages:** Rodil is liable for medical expenses, lost earnings, moral damages, attorney's fees, and costs as originally awarded by the RTC.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2176 of the Civil Code:** Basis for Rodil's liability for damages due to fault or negligence.
*   **Letter of Instructions No. 229:** Regarding the installation of Early Warning Devices (EWD) on stalled vehicles.

**Case Law & Legal Principles:**

*   **Proximate Cause:** The case hinges on determining the direct and immediate cause of Cabardo's injuries.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Supreme Court downplayed inconsistencies in testimonies, emphasizing that minor discrepancies don't necessarily destroy credibility. *Severino Antonio v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 100513, June 13, 1997, citing People v. Daen, 244 SCRA 382 (1995)*.
*   **Negligence:** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court’s finding that Rodil was negligent in driving his car.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:**  The primary risk was the factual dispute over how Cabardo sustained his injuries.
*   **Inconsistencies:** The Court of Appeals focused on inconsistencies in witness statements, which initially jeopardized Cabardo's claim.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Rodil’s lawyers raised procedural issues (Motion for Extension on behalf of the wrong party/Non-Forum Shopping Certificate) that could have jeopardized Cabardo’s case.
*   **Contributory Negligence:** The Santa Cruz Court's finding of Rodil's contributory negligence in the initial case against CIGI and Peralta could potentially be used to mitigate Rodil's liability in Cabardo's case, however the Supreme Court found Rodil fully liable.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately sided with Cabardo, reaffirming the principle that negligent drivers are responsible for damages caused by their actions. The Court emphasized that the minor inconsistencies of the testimonies do not diminish the facts of the accident, and that the totality of evidence supported the finding that Rodil's negligence was the proximate cause of Cabardo's injury.
