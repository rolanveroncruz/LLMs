## Legal Document Summary - *Dagan v. Philippine Racing Commission* (G.R. No. 175220)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC decision, which upheld the Philippine Racing Commission (Philracom)'s directive to Manila Jockey Club, Inc. (MJCI) and Philippine Racing Club, Inc. (PRCI) to address Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Philracom Directive:** MJCI and PRCI required to create house rules to rid facilities of horses infected with EIA, pursuant to Department of Agriculture Administrative Order No. 5.
*   **Blood Testing Requirement:** MJCI and PRCI ordered racehorse owners to submit horses for Coggins Tests.
*   **Philracom Guidelines:** Guidelines issued for monitoring and eradication of EIA.
*   **Sanctions:** Horses belonging to owners who refused testing were banned from races, removed from race days, prohibited from renewing licenses, and evicted from stables.
*   **Owners' Obligations:** Compliance with the rules and condition for racehorse owners when participation in the horseracing industry.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Racehorse Owners:** Potential loss of racing privileges, eviction from stables, and inability to renew licenses for non-compliance.
*   **MJCI and PRCI:** Potential liability for non-compliance with Philracom directives.
*   **Philracom:** Risk of being found to have acted with grave abuse of discretion in compelling blood testing, unconstitutionally delegating rule-making power, and for lack of due process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 8:** Grants Philracom exclusive jurisdiction over horse racing.
*   **P.D. No. 420:** Empowers Philracom to prescribe additional rules and regulations and perform necessary actions.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7953 & 8407:** Franchises granted to PRCI and MJCI, respectively, authorizing operation of racetracks and conduct of races.
*   ***Abella, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission***:  Defines the nature of quasi-legislative powers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delegation of Power:** Petitioners argued Philracom unconstitutionally delegated its rule-making power to MJCI and PRCI by directing them to create club rules.
*   **Due Process:** Petitioners alleged the implementing guidelines did not comply with due process requirements, particularly lack of prior consultation and investigation.
*   **Sanctions:** Petitioners argued that the assailed guidelines are ultra vires in that the sanctions imposed for refusing to submit to medical examination are summary eviction from the stables or arbitrary banning of participation in the races, notwithstanding the penalties prescribed in the contract of lease.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court **DISMISSED** the petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion by Philracom or MJCI/PRCI. It upheld Philracom's authority under P.D. No. 420, deeming the delegation of rule-making power valid. The Court determined that the Philracom directive was instructive, not an unlawful delegation, and the PRCI/MJCI were acting in accordance with their franchises. The Court held that Philracom has every right to issue directives to MJCI and PRCI with respect to the conduct of horse racing, with or without implementing guidelines.

**Risk Assessment:**

The decision reinforces the broad authority of Philracom in regulating the horse racing industry and prioritizing the health and safety of racehorses, even at the expense of individual owner rights and contracts.
