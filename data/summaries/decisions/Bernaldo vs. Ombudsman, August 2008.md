## Legal Document Summary: *Bernaldo v. The Ombudsman*

**Case:** *Marita C. Bernaldo vs. The Ombudsman and DPWH*, G.R. No. 156286, August 13, 2008, 584 Phil. 57.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) affirmation of the Ombudsman's finding of administrative liability against petitioner Bernaldo for "conduct grossly prejudicial to the best interest of the service."

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Administrative Charge:** Bernaldo, as DPWH Region III Project Engineer, was charged with Falsification, Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service due to alleged overpayment to a contractor, L.J. Cruz Construction, for the Almacen River II Project. The Ombudsman found her liable for signing a Statement of Work Accomplished (SWA) and a Certificate of Final Inspection certifying 100% project completion when a Survey and Investigation Team found only 21% completion.
*   **Ombudsman's Order:** Ordered Bernaldo's suspension for nine (9) months without pay and benefits.
*   **CA Ruling:** Initially, the CA reversed the Ombudsman's ruling for other involved engineers, finding the evidence insufficient. However, the CA upheld the Ombudsman's ruling against Bernaldo.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Bernaldo's primary obligation was to accurately report the project's completion status. The Ombudsman held her responsible for the alleged "bloating" of accomplishment reports.
*   Liability stems from signing the SWA and Certificate of Final Inspection, certifying 100% completion, despite evidence indicating a much lower completion rate.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that the Ombudsman's finding of liability was not supported by substantial evidence.
*   **Unreliable Evidence:** The SC deemed the evidence relied upon (Field Survey and Investigation Report and Letter-Report of Engr. David) as speculative and unreliable. The Survey Team's report acknowledged possible destruction of works due to natural causes. Engr. David's report was based on hypothetical assumptions (number of cranes used), and the SC noted it was unsworn and David was not presented as a witness.
*   **Causation:** Link between the signing of the SWA and actual damages to government funds is tenuous.
*   **Conflicting Decisions:** Other engineers involved were exonerated by the CA, raising concerns about inconsistent application of findings. The Supreme Court overturned the CA ruling against Bernaldo.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs appeals to the Supreme Court, limiting review to questions of law, with exceptions for cases where findings are based on speculation or misapprehension of facts.
*   **Section 5, Rule 133, 1997 Revised Rules of Court:** Defines "substantial evidence" as "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." *[Reference in Ombudsman's order]*
*  **Concerned Officials of the MWSS v. Vasquez, 240 SCRA 502:** Technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly applied in administrative proceedings *[Reference in Ombudsman's order]*
*   **Energy Regulatory Board v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 113079, April 20, 2001 357 SCRA 30:** The Supreme Court cited this case in describing the hierarchy of evidentiary values.
*   **Velazquez v. Hernandez, 437 SCRA 357 G.R. 150732, August 31, 2004:** The Supreme Court cited this case in defining substantial evidence.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and the Ombudsman's orders, finding the evidence insufficient to support a finding of administrative liability against Bernaldo.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the importance of substantial evidence in administrative proceedings. Hypothetical calculations, assumptions, and speculative evidence are inadequate to support a finding of administrative liability. Furthermore, demonstrating a clear causal link between the allegedly false certification and actual damage to the government is essential.
