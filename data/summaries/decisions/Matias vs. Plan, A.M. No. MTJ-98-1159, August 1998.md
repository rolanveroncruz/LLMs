**Legal Document Summary: *Matias vs. Judge Plan*, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1159, August 3, 1998 (355 Phil. 274)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a Municipal Trial Court Judge, Sergio A. Plan, for undue delay in resolving Criminal Case No. 95-2424 (Damage to Property Through Reckless Imprudence).

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Leticia G. Matias filed an administrative complaint alleging undue delay by Judge Plan in resolving a criminal case involving damage to her van.
*   **Procedural History:** The criminal case (95-2424) experienced numerous postponements, often exceeding the limits prescribed by the Rules of Court, spanning approximately one and a half years.
*   **Investigating Judge's Findings:** Judge Alivia found respondent judge lax in granting postponements, but noted no bad faith. He specifically cited violations of Section 2, Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Court (continuous trial and postponement limitations).
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court found Judge Plan negligent in his duty to expedite case resolution, violating Administrative Circular No. 3-90 (mandatory continuous trial), Administrative Circular No. 4 and Circular No. 1-89.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Obligation:** Judges have a constitutional (Art. III, Sec. 16) and ethical obligation to ensure speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Liability:** Judge Plan was found liable for failing to comply with the rules on mandatory continuous trial and for excessive leniency in granting postponements.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith vs. Negligence:** While the investigating judge found no bad faith, the Supreme Court emphasized that even without malice, negligence in adhering to procedural rules can undermine the administration of justice.
*   **Interpretation of "Good Cause":** The Court implicitly criticized Judge Plan's interpretation of "good cause" for granting postponements, suggesting a stricter standard is required under the mandatory continuous trial system.
*   **Impact of Administrative Circulars:** Emphasizes the binding nature of administrative circulars issued by the Supreme Court regarding court procedures.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution, Article III, Section 16:** Right to a speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 119, Section 2:** Continuous trial until terminated; postponements (relevant version at the time of the events).
*   **Administrative Circular No. 3-90:** Mandatory continuous trial system.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 4:** Further guidelines on the continuous trial system.
*   **Circular No. 1-89:** Specific guidelines for trial courts implementing mandatory continuous trial.
*   **Rule 22 of the Revised Rules of Court: Adjournments and postponements.**
*   **Rule 30 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: Adjournments and postponements.**

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules aimed at expediting case resolution. It clarifies that even the absence of bad faith does not excuse a judge's failure to comply with the mandatory continuous trial system. The decision serves as a reminder to judges to actively manage their caseloads and avoid excessive leniency in granting postponements. The penalty imposed (fine of P1,000.00) suggests a relatively low degree of culpability, possibly mitigated by the judge's prior good performance, but serves as a disciplinary measure to prevent future violations.
