## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Agojo* (G.R. No. 181318)

This document is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' decision which found German Agojo guilty of violating Section 15, Article III of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act) for the illegal sale of shabu. He was initially charged with both drug sale and illegal possession of firearms (P.D. 1866 as amended by R.A. 8294) but was acquitted on the firearms charge at the RTC level due to lack of evidence.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 15, Article III of R.A. 6425 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **Facts:** A buy-bust operation was conducted based on information from a confidential informant (Alonzo) regarding Agojo's drug dealing. Agojo allegedly sold 206.32 grams of shabu to Alonzo in exchange for marked money. Arrest followed, resulting in the seizure of additional money and a firearm (leading to the separate charge, which was unsuccessful).
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Testimony of informant Alonzo detailing the agreement and transaction.
    *   Testimony of buy-bust team members (Calapati, Salazar, Ablang) corroborating Alonzo's account.
    *   Forensic evidence confirming the substance sold was methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Defense:** Denial, frame-up. Agojo claimed he was at the hospital for family reasons and was arrested after being informed of damage to his car. He alleged inconsistencies in the serial numbers of marked money and a prior frame-up attempt.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   RTC: Guilty of drug sale, sentenced to death. Acquitted on firearms charge.
    *   CA: Affirmed the conviction for drug sale, reduced the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* due to R.A. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty) and the absence of aggravating circumstances.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Agojo is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Agojo is liable to pay a fine of P500,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The defense argued a broken chain of custody, but the courts found it intact. This could be a point for future collateral attacks, *if* new evidence surfaces.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** While not explicitly raised, the facts flirt with the line between entrapment (legal) and instigation (illegal). The success of the prosecution hinges on the court believing Alonzo simply provided an *opportunity* for Agojo to commit a crime he was already predisposed to commit.
*   **Inconsistencies in Marked Money:** Discrepancies in the serial numbers of the buy-bust money, while not decisive, could raise questions about the integrity of the operation.
*   **Defense of Frame-up:** The court dismissed this defense as a common tactic, but *credible* evidence of a prior attempt to frame Agojo (despite the CA acquittal focusing on the incorrect charge) *could* potentially support a reasonable doubt argument, especially if coupled with concerns about the buy-bust money.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425, Sec. 15:** The central statute violated: illegal sale of regulated drugs.
*   **P.D. 1866 as amended by R.A. 8294:** Illegal possession of firearms (charge Agojo was acquitted of).
*   **R.A. 9346:** Abolished the death penalty, leading to the CA reducing the sentence.
*   **Rule 113, Sec. 5(b) of the Rules of Court:** Lawful warrantless arrest requirements. *People v. Del Rosario* (365 Phil. 292) clarifies these requirements.
*   **Case Law on Frame-up:** Courts generally disfavor the frame-up defense, requiring clear and convincing evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **"Peculiar Business Sense":** The court acknowledges the unusual nature of selling drugs on partial payment. This weakens the prosecution's case slightly, as it requires accepting an unusual scenario.
*   **Recovery of Marked Money:** The partial recovery of the marked money leaves some ambiguity, though the court infers the rest went to Agojo.

**Overall Assessment:**

The prosecution successfully established Agojo's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, largely relying on the credibility of the informant and corroborating testimony of the buy-bust team. The defense failed to present sufficient evidence to support the frame-up claim. The chain of custody was adequately demonstrated. However, the unusual payment arrangement and the inconsistency in the serial numbers of the buy-bust money could be exploited in potential future appeals or collateral attacks, but would require significant new evidence to be persuasive.
