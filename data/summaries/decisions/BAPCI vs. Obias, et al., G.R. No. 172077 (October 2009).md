## Legal Document Summary: *Bicol Agro-Industrial Producers Cooperative, Inc. (BAPCI) vs. Edmundo O. Obias, et al.* G.R. No. 172077, October 9, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) Decision and Resolution regarding a right-of-way dispute.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Disputed Road:** A 7-meter wide, 2.9-kilometer long road constructed in 1972 by Bicol Sugar Development Corporation (BISUDECO) across respondents' properties, essential for BISUDECO's sugar milling operations. BAPCI acquired BISUDECO's assets in 1992 and subsequently claimed a right-of-way.
*   **Alleged Agreement:** BAPCI alleges an agreement between BISUDECO and the landowners (respondents) granting BISUDECO the right to construct the road in exchange for employment of landowners' relatives.
*   **Respondents' Claims:** Respondents deny the agreement, claiming they tolerated BISUDECO's use of the road initially due to BISUDECO being a government entity under Martial Law. They assert their rights as landowners, some as tillers under PD 27.
*   **Barricade & Injunction:** Respondents barricaded the road, prompting BAPCI's lawsuit. A preliminary injunction was issued against the respondents, later made permanent.
*   **Alternative Cause of Action:** BAPCI alternatively sought a compulsory easement of right-of-way under Article 649 of the Civil Code, offering to pay indemnity.
*   **RTC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found no concrete evidence of an agreement, denied acquisition by prescription, but granted BAPCI a compulsory easement of right-of-way upon payment of indemnity to landowners.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA affirmed the RTC's findings, but modified the ruling by stating that landowners retain ownership despite the easement. The CA also deleted awards to Prudencio Benosa and Clara Padua, as one didn't claim ownership of affected land and the other was not a party to the proceedings.

**Obligations:**

*   **BAPCI:** Obligated to pay indemnity to the landowners for the easement, as determined by the RTC (P70.00 per square meter).
*   **Respondents:** Obligated to allow BAPCI and other sugar planters' vehicles free passage on the disputed road (permanent injunction).

**Liabilities:**

*   **BAPCI:** Liable to pay landowners indemnity for the compulsory easement of right-of-way based on Article 649 of the Civil Code.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Documented Agreement:** The absence of a written agreement between BISUDECO and landowners weakens BAPCI's claim based on title. BAPCI relies on circumstantial evidence that the courts deemed insufficient.
*   **Discontinuous Easement:**  The road is classified as a discontinuous easement, making it impossible to acquire the right-of-way via prescription based on Article 622 of the Civil Code. This point is supported by *Costabella Corporation v. Court of Appeals* and *Bogo-Medellin Milling Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Valuation of Indemnity:** While the court considered the value of the land and damages to the servient estate, the calculation method and the absence of a specific formula stipulated by Article 649 of the Civil Code, could be further contested.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 622, New Civil Code:** Discontinuous easements can only be acquired by title.
*   **Article 649, New Civil Code:** Governs compulsory easements of right-of-way and indemnity requirements.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27):** Tenant Emancipation Decree.
*   ***Costabella Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, G.R No. 80511, January 25, 1991, 193 SCRA 333.**: Reiterates that a right-of-way is discontinuous and cannot be acquired by prescription.
*   ***Bogo-Medellin Milling Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 455 Phil. 285 (2003).**: Reinforces the discontinuous nature of right-of-way easements and the requirements for acquisition.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Amount of Indemnity:** The determination of the "proper indemnity" under Article 649 of the Civil Code lacks specific guidelines, potentially leading to continued disputes over valuation and compensation. The RTC's adoption of the unit value of P70.00 per square meter based on a 1991 Real Property Field Assessment Sheet is questionable, as it may not accurately reflect fair market value.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision is unfavorable to BAPCI, confirming a compulsory easement but maintaining landowners' ownership. The lack of a documented agreement and the classification of the easement as discontinuous are significant obstacles. While the court affirmed the indemnity award, the valuation method could be subject to further scrutiny. Further legal action may be considered but would likely require new compelling evidence or a persuasive argument against established jurisprudence.
