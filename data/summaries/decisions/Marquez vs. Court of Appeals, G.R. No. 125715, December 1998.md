## Legal Document Summary: *Marquez v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 125715 (1998)

**Nature:**  Action for Reconveyance and Partition with Damages involving a family property dispute.

**Key Facts:**

*   Spouses Rafael Marquez, Sr. and Felicidad Marquez owned a parcel of land as conjugal property.
*   Upon Felicidad's death intestate, Rafael Sr. executed an "Affidavit of Adjudication" in 1982, claiming sole ownership and securing a new title in his name, effectively excluding his children.
*   In 1983, Rafael Sr. executed a "Deed of Donation Inter Vivos" transferring the property to respondents Rafael Jr., Alfredo and Belen, excluding the other children (petitioners).
*   Petitioners filed suit in 1991, alleging fraud and seeking reconveyance and partition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Affidavit of Adjudication:** Unilateral declaration by Rafael Sr. claiming sole heirship, which the Court deemed fraudulent regarding Felicidad's share.
*   **Deed of Donation Inter Vivos:** Transfer of property to respondents. Validity challenged by the excluded heirs.
*   **Constructive Trust:** The Court found that Rafael Sr.'s fraudulent Affidavit of Adjudication created a constructive trust under Article 1456 of the Civil Code.
*   **Partition:** The ultimate remedy sought, requiring division of the property among the rightful heirs, considering the conjugal nature of the property and the improper donation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Donation:** Rafael Sr. could not validly donate his deceased wife's share of the conjugal property (Art. 736, Civil Code).  He was a trustee of that share.
*   **Prescription:** The Court of Appeals ruled that the action was barred by the 4-year statute of limitations for fraud. This ruling was reversed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Reconveyance:** Respondents are obligated to reconvey the portion of the property that rightfully belongs to the petitioners as heirs of Felicidad Marquez.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:**
    *   **Article 887:** Defines compulsory heirs.
    *   **Article 1456:**  Basis for the constructive trust arising from the fraudulent adjudication.
    *   **Article 736:**  Prohibits guardians and trustees from donating entrusted property.
    *   **Article 428** Defines ownership rights
    *   **Articles 1139-1155:** Provisions on prescriptive periods. Specifically cited and applied in determining the applicable prescriptive period for constructive trusts.
*   **Gerona v. de Guzman, 11 SCRA 143 (1964):**  CA incorrectly relied on this case; Supreme Court notes the 4-year fraud prescription under the old Code of Civil Procedure is superseded by the Civil Code's 10-year period for constructive trusts.
*   **Amerol v. Bagumbaran, 154 SCRA 396 (1987):**  Clarifies the inapplicability of *Gerona* under the present Civil Code.
*   **Sta. Ana v. Court of Appeals, 281 SCRA 624 (1997); Vda. de Cabrera v. Court of Appeals, 267 SCRA 339 (1997):** Support the 10-year prescription for reconveyance based on constructive trust.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Donation of Rafael Sr.'s Share:**  While Rafael Sr. could donate his own half, the Court explicitly states that whether such donation was *inofficious* (impairing the legitime of other heirs) is not determined because the necessary evidence was not presented. This leaves open the possibility of future litigation on this issue, requiring an accounting of Rafael Sr.'s assets at the time of the donation.

**Overall Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court's decision (excluding the award of attorney's fees), effectively ruling in favor of the petitioners' right to reconveyance and partition based on the constructive trust.

**Legal Advice Considerations:**

*   **Further Litigation:**  Although the main issue of reconveyance is settled, the potential for future litigation regarding whether the donation was inofficious remains a risk.
*   **Accounting:** An accounting of Rafael Sr.'s assets at the time of the donation may be necessary to determine if the legitime of the other heirs was impaired, which could lead to a reduction in the donation to respondents.
*   **Partition:** The physical division of the property will need to be addressed in subsequent proceedings to ensure equitable distribution among the heirs.
