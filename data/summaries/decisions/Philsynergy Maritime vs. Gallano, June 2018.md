## Legal Document Summary: *Philsynergy Maritime, Inc. vs. Gallano, Jr.*

**Case:** *Philsynergy Maritime, Inc. and/or Trimurti Shipmanagement Ltd., Petitioners, vs. Columbano Pagunsan Gallano, Jr., Respondent.* G.R. No. 228504, June 06, 2018.

**Summary:** This case involves a seafarer, Columbano Pagunsan Gallano, Jr. (Respondent), claiming permanent total disability benefits after suffering a stroke (Cerebrovascular Infarct Middle Cerebral Artery, Right and Hypertension) while working as a Ship Master for Philsynergy Maritime, Inc. and Trimurti Shipmanagement Ltd. (Petitioners). The Supreme Court (SC) denied the Petitioners' appeal, upholding the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) ruling in favor of the Respondent, but modified the basis for the award.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Governing Law:** The SC determined that the 2010 POEA-SEC (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract) governs the relationship between the parties, not the CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement), as initially applied by the lower courts, because the illness was not due to an accident.
*   **Pre-Existing Condition & Concealment:** The Petitioners argued the Respondent fraudulently concealed a pre-existing heart condition (hypertension) due to his possession of Isordil (a medication for angina). The SC rejected this argument, holding that the Petitioners failed to prove Respondent had a pre-existing condition as Isordil is not a medication for hypertension directly. Respondent's PEME showed normal blood pressure. Section 20(E) of the 2010 POEA-SEC provides that if a seafarer who knowingly conceals a pre-existing illness or condition in the PEME shall be liable for misrepresentation and shall be disqualified from any compensation and benefits.
*   **Work-Related Illness:** The SC found that the Respondent's stroke and hypertension were work-related under Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC (specifically sub-items 12 & 13 regarding cerebrovascular events and end organ damage resulting from uncontrolled hypertension). The court noted the Respondent was not known to be hypertensive and his PEME showed normal blood pressure.
*   **Third Doctor Referral:** The Petitioners argued the Respondent failed to comply with Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, which requires a third doctor to resolve disagreements between the company-designated physician and the seafarer's physician. The SC held that the Respondent's compliance with this procedure presupposes a timely and definitive assessment of his fitness or disability by the company-designated physician within the 120/240-day period. Since the company-designated physician's assessment was not timely and definitive, the third-doctor referral provision was not triggered. *Philippine Hammonia Ship Agency, Inc. v. Dumadag; Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar.*
*   **Total and Permanent Disability:** Due to the company-designated physician's failure to provide a definitive assessment within the prescribed period, the SC deemed the Respondent's disability as total and permanent.
*   **Disability Benefits Amount**: Since it was not an accident case, SC awards USD 60,000.00, the compensation under the 2010 POEA-SEC.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Philsynergy Maritime, Inc. and Trimurti Shipmanagement Ltd. are jointly and severally liable to pay Respondent US$60,000 for total and permanent disability benefits, plus 10% attorney's fees.
*   Employers are obligated to provide timely and definitive medical assessments to seafarers within 120/240 days of repatriation to avoid automatic classification of disability as total and permanent.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Medical Assessments:** This case highlights the importance of clear and definitive medical assessments from company-designated physicians. Vague or delayed assessments can result in the seafarer's disability being deemed total and permanent.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Employers bear the burden of proving fraudulent concealment of pre-existing conditions. Speculative opinions or indirect evidence are insufficient.
*   **Misapplication of CBA vs. POEA-SEC:** Correctly applying the appropriate standard employment contract is crucial for determining benefits.
*   **Reliance on Company-Designated Physician:** Employers cannot rely solely on the opinions of company-designated physicians if those opinions are not timely, clear, and definitive.
