Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Jose A. Bernas and The Wharton Resources Group (Philippines), Inc. v. The Estate of Felipe Yu Han Yat, Represented by Hero T. Yu* and *Felomena S. Mejia v. Felipe Yu Han Yat*
**G.R. Nos.:** 195908 & 195910
**Date:** August 15, 2018
**Court:** Supreme Court (Second Division)
**Ponente:** Caguioa, J.

**Subject Matter:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 82681.  The core issue concerns a dispute over ownership of a parcel of land (Lot 824-A-4) in Quezon City.

**Key Facts:**

*   **Yu Han Yat (Respondent):**  Claims ownership based on TCT No. RT-28758 (30627)PR-9639.  This title originated from OCT No. 614, issued before 1930.
*   **Bernas & Wharton (Petitioners):** Claim ownership through a Deed of Sale from Mejia, based on TCT No. 336663, derived from a title originally in the name of Esperanza Nava.
*   **Mejia (Petitioner):** Also claims ownership based on TCT No. 336663.
*   **Overlap:** Both titles (Yu Han Yat's and Bernas/Mejia's) appear to cover the same property, leading to the quieting of title action.
*   **Prior Litigation:**  Yu Han Yat filed a Petition for Quieting of Title (Civil Case No. Q-92-13609) against Nava's Estate, Galarosa, Mejia, Bernas, and the Register of Deeds. The RTC initially ruled in favor of the Estate of Nava, et al. and Wharton. The CA reversed, ruling in favor of Yu Han Yat, prompting this appeal.

**Issues:**

*   **Procedural:** Compliance with Rule 45, alleged forum shopping and res judicata.
*   **Substantive:**
    *   Whether Yu Han Yat's action was a direct or collateral attack on TCT No. 336663.
    *   Whether CA's finding of overlapping properties is supported by evidence.
    *   Applicability of *Manotok v. Barque* (Friar Lands Act compliance).
    *   Propriety of CA taking judicial notice of other cases.
    *   Relevance of Yu Han Yat's tax payments.
    *   Propriety of CA's award of damages.

**Ruling:**

*   **SC Denies the consolidated petitions, Affirms the CA decision with modification regarding damages.**
*   **Forum Shopping/Res Judicata:** No forum shopping occurred. Interests of parties not identical. Heirs of Nava not appealing does not bar appeal of other parties with their own interest in the litigation.
*   **Direct Attack:** The action for quieting of title *was* a direct attack on TCT No. 336663 because it sought annulment of the title. *Villarica Pawnshop v. Spouses Gernale* (2009) cited re: identity of issues in actions for quieting of title vs. annulment of title.
*   **Title Overlap & Superior Title:** The Court holds that *both titles cover the same property*.  Critically, Yu Han Yat's title (TCT No. 30627) is *earlier in date* than TCT No. 336663.  Under *Legarda v. Saleeby* (1915), the earlier title prevails as between the parties. The alleged annotation error on TCT No. 8047 (predecessor to Yu Han Yat's title) does not negate his claim.
*   **Friar Lands Act:** *Manotok v. Barque* and *Alonso v. Cebu Country Club* inapplicable. Issue of compliance with Friar Lands Act not raised in lower courts, thus cannot be raised for first time on appeal.
*   **Judicial Notice:** CA erred in taking judicial notice of proceedings in other cases without notice to the parties. *Tabuena v. Court of Appeals* (1991) cited regarding limitations on judicial notice of other cases. However, this error did not affect the ultimate finding of superior title for Yu Han Yat.
*   **Damages:**  Award of damages (actual, moral, exemplary, attorney's fees) is *deleted*. No evidence of malice or bad faith on Petitioners' part in asserting their claims. *ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. Court of Appeals* (1999) cited re: damnum absque injuria.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:**  Governs appeals to the Supreme Court, limited to questions of law (subject to exceptions).
*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Rules of Court:**  Certification against forum shopping.
*   **Act No. 1120 (Friar Lands Act):**  Governs alienation of friar lands (issue ultimately not dispositive in this case).

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   Petitioners (Bernas, Wharton, Mejia) risk losing the property due to Yu Han Yat's superior title.
*   Potential liability for damages was argued by the Respondent, but was not imposed by the Court.

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court**
*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Rules of Court**
*   **Act No. 1120 (Friar Lands Act)**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **The annotation on TCT No. 8047:** The CA's finding that this was a typographical error is heavily contested, and the CA's method of explanation, while upheld, could be seen as somewhat weak.
*   **The 'Marikina Mistake'**: The court acknowledges that Psd-2498 refers to Marikina.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further litigation, if Petitioners attempt to pursue other legal avenues (e.g., a claim against Mejia for breach of warranty).
