**Summary of *Allied Banking Corporation vs. Land Bank of the Philippines and the Secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform* (G.R. No. 175422, March 13, 2009)**

This case concerns the determination of just compensation for two parcels of land owned by Allied Banking Corporation (Allied) compulsorily acquired by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) under Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Lands:** Two abutting parcels of land in Mabiga, Hermosa, Bataan, covered by TCT No. 97975 (20.4840 hectares) and TCT No. 97976 (21.3835 hectares).
*   **DAR Acquisition:** The DAR compulsorily acquired the lands pursuant to RA 6657. Landbank initially valued the lands using the formula in DAR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 17, Series of 1989, as amended by DAO No. 06, Series of 1992, and further amended by DAO No. 11, Series of 1994.
*   **Disagreement on Valuation:** Allied rejected Landbank's valuation and insisted on a higher value of P180,000 per hectare.
*   **RTC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC), acting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC), adopted the valuation submitted by Allied's nominated commissioner, using the "Market Data Approach" (finding a value of â‚±150,000.00 per hectare).
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) annulled the RTC decision and remanded the case, citing the RTC's failure to adhere to procedural rules and fundamental requirements in determining just compensation.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the RTC gravely abused its discretion by failing to consider the factors outlined in Section 17 of RA 6657 and detailed in DAO No. 6, as amended.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **DAR/Landbank Obligation:** To provide just compensation as mandated by the Constitution and RA 6657.
*   **Landowner's Right:** Right to receive just compensation, but must comply with statutory valuation methods.
*   **Remand Order Obligation:** The RTC now has the obligation to redetermine just compensation in strict compliance with RA 6657, DAR Administrative Orders, and the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Valuation Discrepancy:** The significant difference between Landbank's initial valuation and Allied's desired valuation, potentially leading to continued litigation.
*   **Delayed Compensation:** The remand prolongs the process, further delaying compensation for Allied.
*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:** Failure to strictly comply with procedural requirements on remand could lead to further appeals.
*   **Market Data Approach:** The Supreme Court has expressed reservations about the market data approach, finding that its usage has led to non-compliance with applicable Administrative Orders.
*   **Unsubstantiated Valuation:** As noted by the SC, the landbank valuation also remains unsubstantiated as no reports were submitted to hearings. This has caused the need for a full remand.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** The primary law governing land acquisition and just compensation.
*   **Section 17 of RA 6657:** Outlines the factors to be considered in determining just compensation.
*   **DAO No. 6, Series of 1992 (as amended):** Implements Section 17 of RA 6657 and provides a specific formula for valuation.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses Banal* (G.R. No. 143276, 20 July 2004):** Emphasizes the mandatory nature of Section 17 and DAO 6-92.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada* (G.R. No. 164876, 23 January 2006):** Rejects valuation based solely on neighboring properties without applying the DAR formula.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim* (G.R. No. 171941, 2 August 2007):** Affirms that Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAO No. 6 are mandatory and not mere guides.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability and weight to be given to the "Market Data Approach" in determining just compensation, especially when it deviates from the formula provided in DAO No. 6.
*   The unsubstantiated finding of Landbank, necessitating a full remand in order to determine just compensation.

**Legal Advice:**

Advise Allied to be prepared to substantiate its claim for just compensation with evidence that aligns with the factors outlined in Section 17 of RA 6657 and the formula in DAO No. 6, as amended. Emphasize the mandatory nature of these provisions as established by the Supreme Court. Prepare for the necessity of presenting expert testimony to support the valuation.
