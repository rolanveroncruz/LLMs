## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Francisco*, G.R. No. 216728

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Decito Francisco for Murder. The Supreme Court *partially granted* the appeal, downgrading the conviction to Homicide due to insufficient evidence of treachery.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Accused was initially charged with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for the fatal stabbing of Jaime Noriega III.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC found accused guilty of Murder, ruling out self-defense and finding treachery. CA affirmed.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court found the elements of homicide present (death, accused caused the death, not parricide or infanticide), but found insufficient evidence to establish treachery.

**Obligations:**

*   The Accused must serve the revised sentence for Homicide and is liable for civil damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original (Murder):** Reclusion Perpetua (life imprisonment).
*   **Revised (Homicide):** Imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years of reclusion temporal, as maximum. The accused must pay the heirs of Jaime Noriega III Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity and Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prosecution's Weaknesses:** Key issue was proving treachery. Court found the prosecution failed to demonstrate a conscious and deliberate choice of means to ensure the killing and deprive the victim of a defense (citing *People v. Albao*, 383 Phil. 873, 882 (2000)). The suddenness of the attack, in itself, was insufficient (*People v. Escoto*, 313 Phil. 785, 802 (1995)).
*   **Defense's Failures:** The initial defense of self-defense was not credible because the accused did not prove he suffered injuries from the alleged attack.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes Murder.
*   **Article 14, RPC:** Defines Treachery.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery:** The primary point of contention. The Court's interpretation of "treachery" required evidence of a deliberate plan, which the prosecution failed to provide.

**Note:** The judgment modifies the monetary awards in line with People v. Jugueta, requiring the payment of PHP 50,000 for civil indemnity and PHP 50,000 for moral damages plus interests, with an additional deletion of PHP 30,000 in exemplary damages.
