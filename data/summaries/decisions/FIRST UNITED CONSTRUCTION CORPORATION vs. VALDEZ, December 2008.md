## Legal Document Summary: *First United Construction Corporation v. Menandro G. Valdez and Ramon E. Adea* (G.R. No. 154108) & *National Housing Authority v. Hon. Rose Marie Alonzo-Legasto, et al.* (G.R. No. 157505)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review challenging the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the Ombudsman's finding of guilt against NHA engineers for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, as well as the CA's decision to dismiss the NHA's petition for certiorari and prohibition against the lower court's injunction.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** First United Construction Corporation (FUCC), National Housing Authority (NHA)
*   **Respondents:** Menandro G. Valdez, Ramon E. Adea (NHA Engineers)

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Contract:** NHA contracted FUCC for the Freedom Valley Resettlement Project.
*   **Deviation from Specifications:** FUCC substituted Concrete Treated Base Course (CTBC) for subbase course, violating project specifications.
*   **Disputed Billing:** FUCC submitted a Second Progress Billing, including costs for subbase course not actually laid. Valdez recommended a significantly lower payment based on non-compliance.
*   **Administrative Complaint:** FUCC filed a complaint with the Ombudsman against Valdez and Adea alleging extortion and other misconduct.
*   **Ombudsman Decision:** The Ombudsman initially found Valdez and Adea guilty of grave misconduct (extortion) and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, ordering their dismissal.
*   **Court of Appeals Reversal:** The CA reversed the Ombudsman's decision, finding insufficient evidence to support FUCC's allegations.
*   **Lower court injunction**: The court issued a TRO and a preliminary prohibitory injunction against the NHA.

**Key Legal Issues & Holdings:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence in Administrative Proceedings:**  The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' finding that FUCC failed to provide *substantial evidence* to support its claims of extortion and misconduct.  While relaxed evidentiary rules apply in administrative proceedings, orders must still have a basis in rational probative force. *Melchor v. Gironella, G.R. No. 151138, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 476, 483; Sps. Boyboy v. Atty. Yabut, Jr., 449 Phil. 664, 670 (2003)*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The complainant in an administrative case bears the burden of proving the allegations with substantial evidence.
*   **Mootness:** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal's decision to dismiss the administrative case due to lack of evidence rendered NHA's petition regarding the injunction moot and academic.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **FUCC:** Obligated to adhere to contract specifications. Potentially liable for overbilling and breach of contract.
*   **NHA:** Obligated to ensure proper project execution and payment based on actual accomplishments.
*   **Valdez & Adea:** No liability found based on the provided information. Initially penalized by the Ombudsman, but the decision was reversed due to lack of evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Approval for Substitution:** FUCC's substitution of CTBC for subbase without clear documented approval creates a significant risk.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** Potential conflict of interest if NHA management pressured Valdez and Adea to cover up construction deficiencies.
*   **Damages:** While not explicitly mentioned, FUCC could potentially pursue civil damages based on the initial Ombudsman decision, but the success of such a claim would be questionable given the reversal by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Ambiguity in Logbook Entries:** The logbook entries attributed to Valdez could be interpreted in multiple ways, highlighting the importance of context and additional evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rules on Administrative Proceedings and burden of proof.
*   *Melchor v. Gironella, G.R. No. 151138, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 476, 483; Sps. Boyboy v. Atty. Yabut, Jr., 449 Phil. 664, 670 (2003)*- Case law regarding the weight of evidence in administrative proceedings.
*   Rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity shall not be controlling,

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the NHA engineers, finding that FUCC failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims of extortion and misconduct. The case underscores the importance of adhering to contract specifications, obtaining proper approvals for deviations, and maintaining thorough documentation. This decision effectively absolved the NHA engineers of administrative liability.
