Here's a legal summary of the provided *People v. Borce* decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Samuel Borce*, G.R. No. 124131, April 22, 1998 (352 Phil. 275)

**Facts:** Samuel Borce was convicted by the RTC of Bangued, Abra of two counts of rape with a deadly weapon aggravated by mutilation (Criminal Case No. 1481) and frustrated murder (Criminal Case No. 1482).  The trial court sentenced him to two death penalties for the rape convictions and an indeterminate prison term for the frustrated murder. The case was elevated to the Supreme Court for automatic review due to the imposition of the death penalty. The victim, Regina Baga, testified she was twice raped by Borce who used a bolo, and afterwards hacked her face, causing serious wounds. The accused argued that he had an accident grappling for wood, and it was he, who tried to take wood from the victim.
**Issue:** Did the RTC err in convicting Borce of rape with the use of deadly weapon and permanent physical mutilation and frustrated murder, and imposing the death penalty for each count of rape?

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *affirmed* the conviction for frustrated murder and the two counts of rape, but *modified* the penalties for the rape convictions. The imposition of the death penalty was *reduced* to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Rape (Article 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659):** The SC affirmed the conviction for rape, upholding the trial court's assessment of the victim's credible and consistent testimony. The SC reiterated that lack of sperm is not a sufficient argument to defend the case.
*   **Use of a Deadly Weapon (Article 335, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659):** The court found that the rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon. The Court a quo did not consider the use of a deadly weapon merely with the wounds of the victim but was also aggravated by mutilation.
*   **Mutilation (Article 335 and 262, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659):** The trial court erred in considering wounds to be "permanent physical mutilation". The SC ruled that the wounds to the victim's face, while severe, were inflicted during a cover-up attempt to kill her, not deliberately to maim. This prevented the aggravation to death penalty because there was no deliberation of intent to maim. The court used the generic sense and definition from legal dictionaries (Webster and Black's Law Dictionary).
*   **Frustrated Murder (Articles 248 and 50, Revised Penal Code):**  The Court affirmed the frustrated murder conviction because the number and nature of wounds indicated intent to kill. They were not accidental.
*   **Damages:** The lump sum award of P250,000.00 was modified. The SC awarded indemnity of P50,000.00 for each count of rape, consistent with established jurisprudence.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused is obligated to serve the sentences for frustrated murder and two counts of rape (reclusion perpetua for each count).
*   The accused is obligated to pay P50,000.00 indemnity for each count of rape.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Rape and Frustrated Murder.
*   Civil liability for indemnity.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Definition of "Permanent Physical Mutilation":** The case highlights the ambiguity in the statutory language regarding "permanent physical mutilation". This is a key area of potential contention, and further legislative clarification would be beneficial to prevent inconsistent application.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The case confirms the deference appellate courts give to trial court findings regarding witness credibility. The Court cites *People vs. Villanueva* and *People vs. Bernal*.
* The case also states that uncorroborated testimony of a credible witness in a rape case is enough to warrant a conviction.
*   The award of damages aligns with *People vs. Espinoza* and *People vs. Malunes*.
