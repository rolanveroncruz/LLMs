## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Baptista* (G.R. No. 225783)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Christopher Baptista y Villa*
**Citation:** 839 Phil. 108 (2018)
**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Holding:** Accused-appellant's conviction for Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165) REVERSED and SET ASIDE; Baptista ACQUITTED.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).  Accused allegedly sold 0.0389 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a poseur-buyer.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:**  PDEA agents conducted a buy-bust operation based on a confidential informant's tip.
*   **Seizure & Inventory:**  Inventory and photography of the seized items were conducted at the PDEA office, in the presence of the accused and a media representative. An inventory and request for laboratory examination was also done.
*   **Missing Witnesses:** No elected public official or DOJ representative was present during the inventory and photography, which is a violation of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 at the time of the incident (prior to amendment by RA 10640).

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (prior to amendment):** The apprehending team failed to strictly comply with the chain of custody requirements, specifically the mandatory presence of representatives from the media, DOJ, and an elected public official during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs.

**Liabilities/Consequences:**

*   Original conviction by the RTC (life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00) overturned on appeal.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The absence of the required witnesses during the inventory and photography casts doubt on the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, which is essential for proving the corpus delicti.
*   **Unjustified Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable reasons for the absence of an elected public official and a DOJ representative.  Simply stating that witnesses were invited is insufficient to excuse non-compliance.
*   **Retroactive Application of RA 10640:** The Court did not apply RA 10640 retroactively, which amended Section 21 of RA 9165, as the incident occurred before the amendment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5 & Section 21:** Main statutory basis for the charge and the chain of custody requirements.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):**  While not directly applied, mentioned to show the evolution of the law and the importance of compliance with chain of custody.
*   ***People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):**  Cited regarding the importance of the presence of witnesses to prevent evidence switching or planting.
*   ***People v. Almorfe*, 631 Phil. 51 (2010) & *People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):**  Cited regarding the requirement for the prosecution to explain any procedural lapses in the chain of custody.
*   ***People v. Umipang*, 686 Phil 1024 (2012)** Cited regarding the importance of substantive law compliance, not merely procedure technicalities.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The core issue revolves around the justifiable grounds for deviation from the strict chain of custody rule as outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165. The Court found the explanation offered by the prosecution insufficient to justify the deviation.
