**Case Summary: Atty. Florencio Alay Binalay vs. Judge Elias O. Lelina, Jr. (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2132)**

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against a judge for violation of Section 35, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court and Rule 5.07, Canon 5 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (now Section 11, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Violation:** Judge Lelina, while under preventive suspension (due to prior administrative and criminal charges), engaged in the private practice of law. He represented clients in two separate RTC cases: Crim. Case No. 5192 and Civ. Case No. 632-2006.
*   **Representation:** His name appeared on pleadings as a partner of "Bartolome Lelina Calimag Densing & Associates Law Offices."
*   **Defense:** Judge Lelina argued the prohibition applies only to actively serving judges and cited financial hardship as justification.
*   **Prior Offenses:** The judge had a prior finding of guilt for gross misconduct and suspension without pay, with warning of stiffer penalties on future infractions (Dulay v. Lelina, Jr., A.M. No. RTJ-99-1516).
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found the judge guilty of unauthorized practice of law and recommended a three-month suspension without pay.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are prohibited from engaging in private practice of law per Section 35, Rule 138 and Section 11, Canon 4. This obligation extends even during preventive suspension.
*   Judges must avoid the appearance of impropriety, including maintaining relationships with law firms that could suggest undue influence.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Lelina was found guilty of unauthorized practice of law.
*   **Penalty:** Suspended from office for three months without salary and other benefits. Stern warning issued against future similar acts.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights a potential ambiguity: the prohibition against practicing law while a judge is under suspension. The Court explicitly clarifies the prohibition applies even during suspension.
*   The case reinforces the principle that economic necessity is not a valid defense for violating ethical and legal obligations.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Tabao v. Judge Asis, 322 Phil. 630 (1996):**  Cited to emphasize the incompatibility of judicial functions with the practice of law, preventing special favors and assuring impartiality.
*   **Guerrero v. COMELEC, 391 Phil. 344 (2000):** The court stated the principle of "Ubi lex non distinguit nec nos distinguere debemos" emphasizing that "Where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish."
*   **Dulay v. Lelina, Jr., A.M. No. RTJ-99-1516, July 14, 2005, 463 SCRA 269:** Used in determining the proper penalty since it was the basis for the judge's prior suspension for gross misconduct.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 35, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Prohibits judges and officials of superior courts from engaging in private practice.
*   **Section 11, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Mirrors Rule 138 and explicitly prohibits judges from practicing law.
*   **Sections 9 and 11(B), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10 SC:** Classifies unauthorized practice of law as a less serious charge and provides for associated penalties.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 705, Section 68:** The violation of which was the subject of Criminal Case No. 5192, where the respondent acted as counsel.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central contention was whether the prohibition on practicing law applied to judges under suspension. The Court firmly ruled that it does.
