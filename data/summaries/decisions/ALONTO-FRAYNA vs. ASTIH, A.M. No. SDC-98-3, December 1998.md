**Case Summary: Alonto-Frayna vs. Astih, A.M. No. SDC-98-3**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Judge Abdulmajid J. Astih, Presiding Judge of the 2nd Shari’a District Court, for failure to render a decision within the mandated period and for insubordination.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Delay in Resolution:** Judge Astih failed to render a decision in Civil Case No. 01 (Partition) filed on June 23, 1992 and submitted for resolution on April 7, 1994, violating Section 15(1), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution (3-month decision period for lower courts). The case was still pending as of March 1998.
*   **Non-Compliance with OCA Directives:** Judge Astih repeatedly ignored directives from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to comment on the complaint and explain the delay.
*   **Non-Compliance with Supreme Court Resolution:** Judge Astih failed to comply with a Supreme Court resolution requiring him to comment and show cause why he should not be held in contempt. Although he requested an extension based on medical reasons, he still failed to comply.
*   **Indigent Litigants:** The complainants were certified as indigents, emphasizing the need for prompt resolution.
*   **Judicial Audit Team Findings:** A judicial audit confirmed the unresolved status of the case.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Duty to Decide Cases Promptly:** Judges are obligated to decide cases within 90 days from submission (Ubarra vs. Mapalad, Castillo vs. Castro). Failure constitutes gross inefficiency and neglect of duty.
*   **Duty to Comply with Court Orders:** Judges must comply with resolutions and directives from the Supreme Court and the OCA (Josep vs. Abarquez). Failure to do so constitutes gross misconduct and insubordination (Martinez vs. Zoleta, Labao vs. Espina, Parane vs. Reloza).
*   **Accountability for Neglect:** Judges are accountable for delays and failures to perform their duties diligently (Mapala vs. Nuñez).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** Continued failure to comply with Supreme Court directives could result in contempt proceedings.
*   **Administrative Sanctions:** Delay in resolving cases and insubordination can lead to administrative sanctions, including suspension or dismissal.
*   **Erosion of Public Trust:** Undue delay in resolving cases undermines public trust in the judiciary.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Ubarra vs. Mapalad, 220 SCRA 224:**  Reinforces the 90-day decision rule.
*   **Castillo vs. Castro, 234 SCRA 398:**  Failure to decide within 90 days constitutes serious misconduct.
*   **Martinez vs. Zoleta, 257 SCRA 49:**  Deliberate failure to comply with court resolutions is gross misconduct and insubordination.
*   **Josep vs. Abarquez, 261 SCRA 629:**  Supreme Court resolution requiring comment is not a mere request.
*   **Parane vs. Reloza, A.M. MTJ-92-718:**  Continued refusal to abide by court directives demonstrates contempt for the system.
* **Mapala vs. Nuñez, 240 SCRA 600:** Judge should request more time from the Court if more time is needed.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 15(1), Article VIII, 1987 Constitution:** Mandates decision periods for courts (3 months for lower courts).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None apparent from the document provided.

**Outcome:** Judge Astih was DISMISSED from service with FORFEITURE of his retirement benefits. This highlights the severity of the consequences for failing to meet judicial obligations and defying directives from higher authorities.
