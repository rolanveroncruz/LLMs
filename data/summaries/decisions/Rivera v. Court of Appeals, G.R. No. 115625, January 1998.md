**Legal Document Summary: *Rivera v. Court of Appeals***

**Case:** *Esmundo B. Rivera v. Court of Appeals, Amy Robles, Peregrino Mirambel and Merlina Mirambel* G.R. No. 115625, January 23, 1998.  Ejectment action regarding land ownership dispute.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioner Rivera sufficiently proved that Respondents' houses were located on his titled land, justifying their ejectment. The central question is whether the evidence preponderates in Rivera's favor regarding the location of the houses.

**Summary:**

Rivera filed ejectment suits against Respondents Robles and Mirambel siblings in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC), arguing they illegally occupied his land. The MTC ruled in Rivera's favor. On appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) reversed, finding the Respondents were caretakers on public land applied for by Jose Bayani Salcedo under a Miscellaneous Sales Application (MSA). The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the RTC's reversal, holding that Rivera failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the Respondents’ houses were located on his titled property. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Rivera, as plaintiff, bore the burden of proving by a *preponderance of evidence* that the Respondents’ houses were situated on his titled land. (Rule 133, Section 1, Rules of Court).
*   **Ejectment:** To succeed in an ejectment action, a plaintiff must demonstrate a right to possess the property and that the defendant is unlawfully withholding possession.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to meet the burden of proof in a civil case results in dismissal of the complaint/petition.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Clear Evidence:** The crux of the case is the absence of conclusive evidence determining the precise location of the houses. Both the MTC and RTC decisions lacked robust factual support. The SC, affirming the CA, noted the private survey was insufficient without authentication by the Bureau of Lands and lack of due field inspection.
*   **Reliance on Self-Serving Evidence:** The CA correctly found that evidence was either self-serving or inconclusive.
*   **Failure to Conduct Ordered Survey:** The Metropolitan Trial Court's ordered field survey was not implemented, which hindered the court's ability to make a definitive determination.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 133, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Establishes the standard of proof in civil cases: preponderance of evidence.
*   *New Testament Church of God vs. Court of Appeals*, 246 SCRA 266 (1995): Defines "preponderance of evidence" as evidence of greater weight or more convincing than opposing evidence.
*   *Municipality of Candijay, Bohol vs. Court of Appeals*, 251 SCRA 530 (1995): Re-iterates that when evidence is in equipoise, the party with the burden of proof fails.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The location of Respondents' houses, whether on Rivera's private land or on public land subject to Salcedo's MSA, remains unresolved due to the lack of definitive evidence (i.e., an authenticated survey or ocular inspection).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the ejectment case, emphasizing the petitioner's failure to establish by a preponderance of evidence that the respondents' houses encroached on his titled property. The decision underscores the importance of reliable evidence in property disputes and the consequences of failing to meet the burden of proof. The case highlights the need for proper land surveys authenticated by the Bureau of Lands to avoid these issues.
