**Case Summary: Highpoint Development Corporation v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. 224389**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's decision granting Highpoint Development Corporation's (HDC) application for original registration of title under PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree).

**Key Issue:** Whether HDC sufficiently proved that the subject land (Lot 7217, Lilo-an, Cebu) is alienable and disposable land of the public domain and established possession for the period required by law.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision and dismissing HDC's application for registration.

**Key Provisions and Requirements:**

*   **PD 1529, Sec. 14(1):** Outlines the requirements for original registration of title. The central issue concerns proof that the land is alienable and disposable.
*   **Proof of Alienability and Disposability:** Citing *Rep. of the Phils. v. T.A.N Properties, Inc. (578 Phil. 441 (2008))* the Court held that a mere CENRO/PENRO certification is insufficient.  Applicants must present a certified true copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary, certified by the legal custodian of the official records. This is necessary to prove that the DENR Secretary approved the land classification and released the land from the public domain.
*   **Possession:** While evidence of possession (tax declarations, witness testimonies) was presented, the lack of proper documentation regarding the land's classification overrides any claim of adverse possession.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** HDC failed to meet its burden of proving that the land was classified as alienable and disposable by the appropriate government agency.
*   **Reliance on CENRO Certification:** HDC's reliance solely on the CENRO certification was deemed insufficient. The Court reiterates the mandatory requirement of presenting a certified true copy of the DENR Secretary's original classification.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Pro Hac Vice Ruling:** The Court explicitly stated that the *Republic of the Phils. v. Vega, et al. (654 Phil. 511 (2011))* ruling, allowing substantial compliance in similar cases, was *pro hac vice* and cannot be used as precedent.
*   **Substantial Compliance Argument:**  The Court rejected the argument for substantial compliance due to the critical importance of the DENR Secretary's certification.
*   **Reliance on Tax Declarations:** The Court states that presenting tax declarations is not enough to establish ownership as it only shows signs of possession in the concept of an owner and requires further proof of specific acts of ownership.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree)
*   DENR Administrative Order No. 1998-24
*   DENR Administrative Order No. 2000-11
*   DENR Administrative Order No. 2007-20

**Case Law:**

*   *Republic of the Phils. v. T.A.N Properties, Inc. (578 Phil. 441 (2008))* - Establishes the strict requirement for proving alienability and disposability.
*   *Republic of the Phils. v. Vega, et al. (654 Phil. 511 (2011))* - Pro hac vice ruling on substantial compliance, deemed inapplicable.
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Alaminos Ice Plant and Cold Storage, Inc.* G.R. No. 189723, July 11, 2018. - Recent case reiterating the rule.
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Spouses Go* G.R. No. 197297, August 2, 2017- Positive act must be secured from the government

**Legal Precision:**

The decision emphasizes the strict requirements for proving that land is alienable and disposable, placing a heavy burden on applicants for original registration. The *T.A.N. Properties* ruling remains controlling precedent, requiring a certified true copy of the DENR Secretary's original classification. This case serves as a cautionary tale against relying solely on CENRO certifications or historical tax declarations.
