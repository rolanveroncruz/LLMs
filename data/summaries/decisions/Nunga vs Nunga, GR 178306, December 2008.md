Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Francisco R. Nunga, Jr. and Victor D. Nunga v. Francisco N. Nunga III*, G.R. No. 178306, December 18, 2008:

**Case Summary: *Nunga v. Nunga*, G.R. No. 178306**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' reversal of the RTC decision regarding ownership of shares of stock in Rural Bank of Apalit, Inc. (RBA).

**Facts:**

*   Jesus Gonzalez (Gonzalez) agreed via Contract to Sell to sell his RBA shares to Francisco R. Nunga, Jr. (Francisco Jr.) with a down payment made.
*   Prior to full payment by Francisco Jr., Gonzalez executed a Deed of Assignment for the same shares to Francisco N. Nunga III (Francisco III), who paid the full price.
*   Upon learning of this, Francisco Jr. paid Gonzalez the remaining balance and received a Deed of Absolute Sale.
*   The Corporate Secretary refused to register the transfer to Francisco Jr., as Francisco III had already asserted his claim.
*   Litigation ensued, consolidated from SEC to RTC.

**RTC Decision:**

*   Ruled in favor of Francisco Jr., ordering registration of the transfer, relying on the earlier Contract to Sell and Deed of Absolute Sale in his favor, and invoking R.A. 8179 (liberalizing foreign investment) regarding Francisco Jr.'s citizenship. Damages were awarded.

**Court of Appeals Decision (Reversed RTC):**

*   Held the sale to Francisco Jr. *void ab initio* because at the time of the sale, Francisco Jr., a naturalized US citizen, was disqualified from owning shares in a rural bank under Republic Act No. 7353, Section 4, which mandates full Filipino ownership.
*   Refused retroactive application of Republic Act No. 8179 as it would impair the vested rights of Francisco III arising from the Deed of Assignment.
*   Ordered Victor Nunga to surrender the stock certificates, and RBA to register the transfer in favor of Francisco III. Awarded attorney's fees to Francisco III.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **R.A. 7353, Section 4:**  Mandates Filipino ownership of rural banks.  Crucial statutory basis for invalidating the sale to Francisco Jr. at the time.
*   **R.A. 8179 (Foreign Investment Act):**  This Act later granted investment rights to former natural-born Filipinos. The CA correctly notes it doesn't have automatic retroactive effect.
*   **Vested Rights:** The CA found Francisco III possessed vested rights by virtue of the Deed of Assignment. This prevents retroactive application of R.A. 8179.
*   **Contract to Sell vs. Deed of Assignment:**  While the Contract to Sell preceded the Deed, the prior contract was invalidated based on the lack of capacity of Francisco Jr. This is supported by case law stating that "a void agreement will not be rendered operative by the parties' alleged performance (partial or full) of their respective prestations. A contract that violates the law is null and void ab initio and vests no rights and creates no obligations. It produces no legal effect at all."
*   **Double Sale:** The court ultimately focuses on the issue of legal capacity to purchase rather than the conflict inherent in a double sale.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactivity of R.A. 8179:** The petitioners attempted to argue this law could be applied retroactively. The court correctly applied precedent, however, it is worth exploring whether a stronger argument for implied retroactivity could be made based on legislative intent.
*   **Determination of "Vested Rights":** The Court of Appeals based its decision on the principle that a new law should not impair vested rights. This vested right was derived from the Deed of Assignment in favor of Francisco III.
*   **Damages:** The lack of proof of emotional distress was fatal to the claim for moral damages.

**Case Law:** *Bulos, Jr. v. Yasuma*, G.R. No. 164159 (2007), is cited as precedent for interpreting Section 4 of R.A. 7353.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision, denying the Petition. The crucial point is the illegality of the initial sale due to Francisco Jr.'s non-compliance with the Filipino ownership requirement under R.A. 7353 at the time of the sale.
