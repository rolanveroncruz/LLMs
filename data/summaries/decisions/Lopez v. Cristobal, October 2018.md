**Legal Document Summary: *Carlos V. Lopez v. Atty. Milagros Isabel A. Cristobal* (A.C. No. 12146)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a lawyer for neglect of duty and failure to properly withdraw from representation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Engagement and Acceptance Fee:** Lopez engaged Atty. Cristobal for a case (Civil Case No. 09-711) and paid an acceptance fee of P35,000.
*   **Failure to File Position Paper:** Atty. Cristobal failed to file a position paper ordered by the RTC, violating Canon 18, Rule 18.03 (Neglect of entrusted legal matter).
*   **Misrepresentation:** Lopez alleged that Atty. Cristobal misrepresented that she already filed their position paper in court violating Canon 18, Rule 18.04 (Duty to keep client informed).
*   **Improper Withdrawal:** Atty. Cristobal failed to file a formal withdrawal of appearance with the court, violating Canon 22, Rule 22.01 (Withdrawal only for good cause and upon notice).
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Cristobal argued she didn't file the position paper due to Lopez's refusal to pay accumulated legal fees and that partial refund of the acceptance fee was enough to compensate for whatever delays caused in the litigation of Civil Case No. 09-711.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) recommended a six-month suspension from the practice of law.

**Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Cristobal's Duty of Diligence:** Under Canon 18, Atty. Cristobal had a duty to serve her client with competence and diligence, once she took the case. *Sps. Lopez v. Atty. Limos, 780 Phil. 113, 120 (2016)*
*   **Proper Withdrawal Procedure:** Under Canon 22, Atty. Cristobal was obligated to either obtain written consent from Lopez or seek permission from the court to withdraw, including proper notice and hearing. *Ernesto L. Pineda, Legal and Judicial Ethics 267 (1995)*.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Atty. Cristobal is found liable for violating Canons 18 and 22, specifically Rules 18.03, 18.04, and 22.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).
*   **Suspension:** Six-month suspension from the practice of law.
*   **Restitution:** Ordered to return P25,000 to Lopez, the remaining balance of the acceptance fee.
*   **Potential for Increased Penalty:** Failure to comply with the restitution order could result in a more severe penalty.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reasonableness of Fees:**  While the acceptance fee is acknowledged, the court addresses the dispute by ordering partial refund.
*   **Civil vs. Administrative Liability:** The Court clarifies that while disciplinary proceedings generally don't address civil liability, the refund of unearned acceptance fees is intrinsically linked to the attorney-client relationship and falls within the purview of administrative discipline in this case, citing *Pitcher v. Atty. Gagate, 719 Phil. 82, 94 (2013)*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The disagreement over attorney's fees and the assertion that Lopez was a "difficult client" appear to be attempts by Atty. Cristobal to justify her inaction. These claims are dismissed by the Court.
