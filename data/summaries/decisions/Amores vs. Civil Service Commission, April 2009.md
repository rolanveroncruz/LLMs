**Case Summary: *Amores v. Civil Service Commission***

**Legal Issue:** Whether Dr. Amores' separation from his position as Deputy Director for Hospital Support Services at the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) was valid, given his lack of Career Executive Service (CES) eligibility.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Civil Service Law (EO 292):**  Specifically, Sections 7 & 8, classifying positions and requiring appropriate eligibility for permanent appointments. Positions in the Career Executive Service (CES) are covered by Section 8(c).
*   **Section 27 of the Civil Service Law:** Distinction between permanent and temporary appointments based on eligibility.  A permanent appointment requires meeting all qualifications, including eligibility. A temporary appointment allows for appointment of one lacking only eligibility.
*   **CES Board Rules & Regulations:** Govern the CES eligibility examinations and conferment process. Completion of the examination and the Board's recommendation is required for CES rank and security of tenure.

**Obligations:**

*   To possess the requisite CES eligibility for a permanent appointment to a CES position like Deputy Director.
*   To undergo the CES Board's process for conferment of eligibility and appointment to a CES rank.

**Liabilities:**

*   Loss of position due to lack of the necessary CES eligibility.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Security of Tenure:** Non-CES eligibles in CES positions hold temporary appointments and can be removed without cause.
*   **Denial of Due Process:** The petitioner's separation was based on ineligibility, not the dishonesty charge, which was raised but not definitively ruled upon. However, the court found no denial of due process since ineligibility alone was sufficient grounds for removal.
*   **Equal Protection Claims:** The argument that other similarly situated employees without CES eligibility were not terminated was rejected by the Court.

**Case Law References:**

*   ***Caringal v. Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office:*** Re-iterates that a permanent appointment in the civil service is issued to a person who has met the requirements of the position to which the appointment is made in accordance with law and the rules issued pursuant thereto.
*   ***Cuevas v. Bacal:*** Clarifies that the possession of the required CES eligibility is that which will make an appointment in the career executive service a permanent one.
*   ***Achacoso v. Macaraig:*** The mere fact that a particular position belongs to the career service does not automatically confer security of tenure on its occupant

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether designation of appointment as "permanent" by the appointing authority, when the appointee lacks the necessary CES eligibility, has any legal effect. The court held that it does not; such appointments remain temporary.

**Summary of Ruling:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Dr. Amores, finding that his appointment as Deputy Director was temporary due to his lack of CES eligibility. The court emphasized that CES eligibility is a prerequisite for security of tenure in CES positions. Since Amores never acquired CES eligibility, he had no right to security of tenure and could be removed, regardless of his competence or alleged denial of due process on other charges.
