Okay, here's a summary of *Kalubiran v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 83106, December 21, 1998) for a lawyer, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *Kalubiran v. Court of Appeals***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's ruling, which found Kalubiran liable for damages.

**Facts:**

*   JRCM contracted with PLDT for restoration work. PLDT complained of substandard repairs.
*   Kalubiran (Kalmar Construction) claimed to have performed the *repair* of JRCM's restoration work (the "Repair Work") and demanded payment from PLDT for P28,000, alleging JRCM refused to pay due to PLDT's non-payment of JRCM.  A letter to this effect was sent by Kalubiran's counsel to PLDT.
*   JRCM sued Kalubiran for damages, alleging it never authorized the Repair Work and the letter caused PLDT to cease awarding it major contracts. JRCM claimed unfair competition based on PLDT's policy against subcontracting.
*   Kalubiran countered that the letter was pursuant to an agreement at a meeting with PLDT and JRCM.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Central Issue:** Whether Kalubiran's letter to PLDT seeking payment for the Repair Work gave rise to damages in favour of JRCM.
*   **Implied Obligation to Not Engage in Unfair Competition:** JRCM's claim hinges on the existence of a PLDT policy prohibiting subcontracting and the implied obligation of contractors not to undermine each other's contractual relationships.
*   **One-Year Warranty:** Cebu City Engineer stated acceptance of the original work did not relieve JRCM of its obligation to repair the failure of any section within one year from the date of acceptance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC and CA Rulings:** Both courts ruled in favor of JRCM, awarding temperate and exemplary damages, plus attorney's fees.
*   **Basis of Liability:** The courts found that Kalubiran made repairs without authority. The Court of Appeals found bad faith in Kalubiran's actions of demanding payment.
*   **Key Finding of Fact:**  The Court of Appeals (reversing, in effect, the RTC's finding) found that JRCM, not Kalubiran, actually performed the Repair Work.  This was crucial to the determination of liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute: Performance of Repair Work:**  The core dispute lies in who performed the Repair Work. The Supreme Court sided with the CA's finding that JRCM, not Kalubiran, did.
*   **Subcontracting Policy:** The existence and enforceability of PLDT's alleged no-subcontracting policy are key to JRCM's unfair competition claim. *Was such policy properly communicated and/or legally binding?*
*   **Lack of Privileged Communication:** The letter from Kalubiran's counsel was found *not* to be privileged, unlike pleadings within a judicial proceeding.
*   **Attribution of Counsel's Actions:** The court held Kalubiran responsible for the actions of her counsel, citing the general rule that a client is bound by the mistakes of their lawyer.
*   **Damages:** The award of *temperate* and *exemplary* damages suggests the court found elements beyond mere negligence (e.g., bad faith). Scrutinize the evidentiary basis for these awards.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Mistake of Counsel Binds Client:**  Cited *Legarda v. Court of Appeals*, 195 SCRA 418 (1991). This is a standard principle, but gross negligence *can* warrant relief.
*   **Pleadings as Privileged Communication:**  Distinguished *Deles v. Aragona, Jr.*, 27 SCRA 633 (1969). This case addresses statements within pleadings *during* judicial proceedings, which provides absolute privilege.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Agreement" for Repair Work:** Kalubiran claimed there was an agreement reached at a meeting to undertake the Repair Work. The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to support this claim. This meeting and any alleged agreement are highly contentious. *Were minutes taken? Were there other witnesses besides Kalubiran and Sayson?*
*   **Authority of Ben Sayson:** The RTC initially questioned the authority of Ben Sayson (allegedly representing JRCM) to authorize Kalubiran to do the Repair Work.

**Key Takeaways:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, finding Kalubiran liable. The case turned on the factual finding that JRCM, not Kalubiran, performed the repairs and the finding of bad faith in sending the demand letter to PLDT. The ruling highlights the importance of establishing the authority to perform work and carefully considering the potential consequences of communications that could harm another party's business relationships.

I hope this helps!
