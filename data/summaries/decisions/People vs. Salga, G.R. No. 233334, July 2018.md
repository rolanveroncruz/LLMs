## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Salga and Namalata*, G.R. No. 233334 (2018)

**Case:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction of John Carlo Salga and Ruel "Tawing" Namalata for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Holding:** SC acquits Namalata, affirming Salga's conviction.  The Court found insufficient evidence to prove conspiracy between Salga and Namalata.

**Facts:**
*   Salga and Namalata were charged with robbery with homicide for an incident where the Zulita residence was robbed, money and a phone were stolen, and the househelper, Catalina Arcega, was killed.
*   Joan Camille Zulita identified Salga as one of the robbers who entered the house.
*   Constancio Hinlo, Jr. testified that he saw Namalata driving a motorcycle with Salga and another unidentified person shortly after the robbery.
*   Both Salga and Namalata presented alibis.

**Legal Analysis & Key Provisions:**

*   **Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294(1), RPC):** The Court affirms that the elements of the crime were established: (1) taking of personal property; (2) intent to gain; (3) use of violence/intimidation; and (4) homicide on occasion of robbery (citing *People v. Latam*). The intent to rob must precede the taking of life.

*   **Identification:** The Court found that Joan Camille Zulita's identification of Salga met the "totality of circumstances" test set forth in *People v. Teehankee, Jr.*, justifying the admission of the identification. Her opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime, degree of attention, and level of certainty were deemed reliable.

*   **Circumstantial Evidence (Namalata):** The Court found the circumstantial evidence against Namalata insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court emphasizes *People v. Monje*, specifying (a) court must act with caution; (b) all the essential facts must be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt; (c) the facts must exclude every other theory but that of guilt of the accused; and (d) the facts must establish with certainty the guilt of the accused to convince beyond reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator of the offense.
The Court emphasized that the evidence against Namalata was equivocal and the Court rejected the conclusion that simply seeing Namalata speeding away on a motorcycle was enough to implicate him.

*   **Conspiracy (Namalata):** SC specifically rules that the prosecution failed to prove conspiracy between Salga and Namalata. The Court requires positive and conclusive evidence for conspiracy. The mere presence at the scene of the crime does not in itself amount to conspiracy.  The community of design must be a conscious one, and conspiracy transcends mere companionship (citing *People v. Lizada*). Requires an overt act (physical activity indicating intent to commit crime). No witness placed Namalata at the crime scene. *Even knowledge of, or acquiescence in, or agreement to cooperate is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy, absent any active participation in the commission of the crime with a view to the furtherance of the common design and purpose.*

*   **Damages:** Awards of damages conform to *People v. Jugueta*.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Salga:** Remains liable for the crime of Robbery with Homicide and ordered to pay damages to the heirs of Catalina Arcega and Joan Camille Zulita.

**Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** Case highlights the risks in relying solely on circumstantial evidence for conviction, especially when it is open to multiple interpretations.
*   **Proof of Conspiracy:** The case reinforces the high burden of proof required to establish conspiracy, requiring more than mere presence or association.
