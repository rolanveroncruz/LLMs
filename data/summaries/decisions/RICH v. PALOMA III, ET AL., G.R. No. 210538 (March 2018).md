## Legal Document Summary - *Rich v. Paloma III, et al.* (G.R. No. 210538)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's reversal of the RTC decision, concerning the validity of a Deed of Redemption by a dissolved corporation.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan & Mortgage:** Dr. Rich (Petitioner) lent money to his brother Estanislao, secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   **Foreclosure:** Petitioner foreclosed due to non-payment, acquiring the property at auction.
*   **Subsequent Mortgage:** Prior to foreclosure, Estanislao mortgaged the same property to Maasin Traders Lending Corporation (MTLC), represented by Servacio (Respondent).
*   **Dissolution of MTLC:** The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dissolved MTLC in September 2003.
*   **Redemption:** Servacio, as MTLC's president, exercised equitable redemption after the foreclosure.
*   **RTC Decision:** RTC ruled in Petitioner's favor, declaring the MTLC mortgage and Deed of Redemption void.
*   **CA Decision:** CA reversed, upholding the mortgage's validity due to notarization and insufficient proof of forgery.

**Issues:**

1.  **Procedural Issue:** Whether the CA erred in not dismissing the appeal due to deficiencies in the Appellant's Brief (lack of subject index and page references). The Supreme Court (SC) found no grave abuse of discretion by the CA in this respect.
2.  **Substantive Issue:** Whether a corporation dissolved at the time of redemption can validly redeem property.

**Ruling & Liabilities:**

*   **Holding:** The SC reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC decision.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Corporate Dissolution:** Citing Section 122 of the Corporation Code (B.P. 68) and *Yu vs. Yukayguan*, a dissolved corporation retains limited powers for liquidation purposes (collecting assets, settling claims, paying debts) for three years, but cannot engage in new business.
    *   **Void Mortgage:** Because the mortgage between Estanislao and MTLC was executed *after* MTLC's dissolution in September 2003 (specifically, January 24, 2005), it was void *ab initio* due to MTLC's lack of juridical personality.
    *   **Invalid Redemption:** Consequently, MTLC's redemption based on this void mortgage is also void.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68), Section 122:** Governs the powers of dissolved corporations, as noted in *Rebollido vs. Court of Appeals* and *Castle's Administrator v. Acrogen Coal, Co.*
*   ***Yu vs. Yukayguan* (607 Phil. 581, 607 (2009)):** Clarifies the liquidation process for dissolved corporations.
*   **Rules of Court, Rules 44 & 50:** Discusses the grounds for appeal and the dismissal of appeals, cited in *De Leon vs. Court of Appeals*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Underlying Loan:** The document does not directly address the validity of Estanislao's underlying debt to MTLC (if any) which is a key consideration for the application of equitable redemption of the real property.
*   **Good Faith:** The good faith of parties involved in the real estate mortgage transaction and redemption were not properly considered in the Supreme Court ruling.
* **Rights of Creditors:** The Supreme Court decision did not take into consideration that if Estanislao indeed owed MTLC money, MTLC's creditors would not be able to collect on that debt if the Mortgage was considered void.

**Conclusion:**

The decision emphasizes that a dissolved corporation cannot create new obligations or engage in new business, even during its liquidation period. The critical factor was the timing of the mortgage execution in relation to MTLC's dissolution. This case underscores the importance of verifying the corporate status of parties before entering into agreements.
