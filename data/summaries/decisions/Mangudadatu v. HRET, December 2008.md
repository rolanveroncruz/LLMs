## Legal Document Summary - *Datu Pax Pakung S. Mangudadatu v. HRET and Angelo O. Montilla* (G.R. No. 179813)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing HRET Resolutions in an election protest case (HRET Case No. 07-021).

**Key Issue:** Validity of service of summons on the petitioner (protestee), Datu Pax Pakung S. Mangudadatu, via registered mail.

**HRET Resolutions:**
*   **Resolution No. 07-179:** Noted receipt of summons by Aileen R. Baldenas and considered petitioner to have entered a general denial for failure to file an answer within the prescribed period.
*   **Resolution No. 07-300:** Denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration and Motion to Admit Answer with Counter-Protest, holding that service on Baldenas at petitioner's residence was valid.

**Petitioner's Argument:** HRET lacked jurisdiction over his person due to improper service of summons. He claimed Baldenas was neither a household member nor an authorized recipient.

**Respondent's Argument:** HRET Rules do not expressly require personal service, and service by registered mail is permissible. Rules of Court provisions on personal and substituted service do not apply.

**Court's Ruling:** Petition granted. HRET Resolutions set aside. HRET directed to admit petitioner's Answer with Counter-Protest.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**
*   **HRET Rule 22:** Governs issuance of summons by the HRET Secretary.  Silent on the mode of service.
*   **HRET Rule 80:** Provides for suppletory application of the Rules of Court.
*   **Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7, Rules of Court:** Mandates personal service of summons whenever practicable, followed by substituted service if personal service is impossible after reasonable effort.

**Liabilities/Risks:**
*   **HRET's Failure to Comply with Rules of Court:** The HRET erred in relying on service by registered mail without exhausting personal service and demonstrating the impossibility thereof. This constitutes grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Potential Impact on Election Results:**  A finding of improper service and subsequent admission of the Answer with Counter-Protest could lead to a revision of ballots and potentially alter the outcome of the election.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **HRET Rules:** Rules 22 and 80 are central to the dispute.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7:**  Governs the mode of service of summons, especially concerning personal and substituted service, which were improperly bypassed here.
*   ***Federico S. Sandoval II v. HRET***, G.R. No. 149380 (2002): Established the principle that the Rules of Court apply suppletorily to HRET rules regarding service of summons.
*   ***Olar v. Cuna***: A court case to provide evidence of situations in which service via registered mail is not permissible.
*   Other cited cases reinforce the requirement of strict compliance with rules on substituted service.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Interpretation of HRET Rule 22:**  Respondent argued that its silence on the mode of service implies discretion, but the Court rejected this, emphasizing the suppletory application of the Rules of Court.
*   **HRET's "Impracticability" Argument:** The HRET argued it was "impracticable" to personally serve summons in distant provinces. The Court rejected this, stating that the HRET could use its own process servers or delegate to local court process servers.

**Potential Next Steps:**
*   The HRET must admit the petitioner's Answer with Counter-Protest.
*   The election protest will proceed, potentially involving a revision of ballots.
*   Further appeals to the Supreme Court are possible depending on the outcome of the HRET proceedings.
