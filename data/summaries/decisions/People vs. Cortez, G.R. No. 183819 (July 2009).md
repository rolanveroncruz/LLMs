**Case Summary: *People v. Cortez*, G.R. No. 183819 (July 23, 2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) â€“ illegal sale of *shabu*.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Accused-appellant Arsenio Cortez sold 0.04 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a police poseur-buyer (SPO2 Zipagan) during a buy-bust operation.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The operation was initiated based on information from a confidential informant. SPO2 Zipagan acted as poseur-buyer, purchasing the *shabu* with marked money. The accused was arrested after delivering the drugs.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the testimony of the poseur-buyer (SPO2 Zipagan) and back-up officer (PO1 Espares), the marked money, and the Physical Science Report confirming the substance as *shabu*.  Defense stipulated to the authenticity and due execution of laboratory request and report.
*   **Defense:** Cortez denied the crime, alleging a frame-up. His witness testified he saw officers barging into Cortez's home.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** Liable for the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under RA 9165 if the prosecution proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Specifically, the prosecution must establish (1) the sale and delivery of the prohibited drug and (2) the accused's knowledge that the substance was a prohibited drug.
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Must follow procedures in RA 9165 and its IRR to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs (chain of custody).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:**  Cortez raised concerns about the chain of custody, arguing the lack of immediate inventory and marking created doubt.  The Court acknowledged that strict adherence to Sec. 21 of the IRR is not always required; *substantial compliance* is sufficient as long as the integrity and evidentiary value are preserved (citing *People v. Naquita*, G.R. No. 180511; *People v. Concepcion*, G.R. No. 178876). The Court notes stipulations to authenticity of testing process.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The Court distinguished between entrapment (legal) and instigation (absolutory cause), emphasizing that the criminal intent must originate with the accused, not the police (citing *People v. Doria*, G.R. No. 125299).  The Court uses an "objective" standard to test the validity of the operation, focusing on the actions of law enforcement (citing *People v. Doria*).
*   **Defense of Denial:** The Court found the defense of denial weak, especially given the lack of evidence of ill motive on the part of the police officers.
*   **Lack of Supplemental Brief:** The Court noted the lack of a supplemental brief from Cortez, inferring his willingness to rely on arguments already presented.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sec. 5, Art. II:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs).
*   **Rules of Court, Sec. 3(m), Rule 131:** Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
*   ***People v. Bongalon*, G.R. No. 125025:** Legality of buy-bust operations as a form of entrapment.
*   ***People v. Lua Chu and Uy Se Tieng*, 56 Phil. 44:** Distinction between entrapment and instigation.
*   ***People v. Doria*, G.R. No. 125299:** Objective test for entrapment; elements of a buy-bust operation.
*   ***People v. Pendatun*, G.R. No. 148822:** Elements of the crime of illegal sale of prohibited drugs.
*   ***Malillin v. People*, G.R. No. 172953:** Chain of custody requirements.
*   ***People v. Naquita*, G.R. No. 180511; *People v. Concepcion*, G.R. No. 178876:** Substantial compliance with IRR Sec. 21 is sufficient for chain of custody.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Cortez's conviction, finding the prosecution proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court upheld the legality of the buy-bust operation and found substantial compliance with chain of custody requirements. The Court emphasized the weakness of the defense's denial.
