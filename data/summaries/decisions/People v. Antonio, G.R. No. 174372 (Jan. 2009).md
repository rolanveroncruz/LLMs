**Case Summary: *People v. Antonio*, G.R. No. 174372 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Elpidio Antonio (Appellant) for two counts of rape of his minor daughter (AAA).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under the Revised Penal Code (RPC), committed on June 6, 1994 and August 14, 1994. Force was allegedly used, with a kitchen knife used to threaten AAA.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** Appellant's primary argument rests on an Affidavit of Desistance purportedly executed by AAA *after* the RTC judgment. She states a lack of sufficient basis for conviction and claims the case stemmed from a dispute between Appellant and AAA's mother (BBB).
*   **Medical Evidence:** Medical examination showed healed lacerations on AAA's hymen consistent with penetration.
*   **Defense:** Appellant denies the charges, claiming BBB filed them out of retaliation for their marital issues. His mother testified that BBB demanded money and property in exchange for dropping the charges.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Appellant guilty and sentenced him to death for each count, plus indemnity and damages to AAA.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Obligations:** To refrain from sexually abusing his daughter. Failure to comply results in criminal liability.
*   **Appellant's Liabilities:** Initially sentenced to death (later reduced), and ordered to pay indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Affidavit:** The affidavit's presentation *after* the judgment of conviction weakens its credibility and admissibility. Courts generally disfavor affidavits of desistance presented at this stage. *Firaza v. People* (G.R. No. 154721) cited.
*   **Sufficiency of Affidavit:** The affidavit does not explicitly deny the rape occurred. It primarily offers a legal conclusion about lack of basis for conviction. *People v. Garcia* (G.R. No. 110990) requires denial of the truth of the complaint, not just withdrawal of prosecution.
*   **Authenticity of Affidavit:** The Supreme Court raises doubts about the authenticity of AAA's signature on the affidavit, noting discrepancies with her signature on the original complaint.
*   **Retraction Issues:** As per *People v. Junio* (G.R. No. 110990), retractions are viewed with suspicion, especially after a victim has undergone the legal process of accusing the defendant.
*   **Death Penalty:** Original sentence included death penalty, but Republic Act No. 9346 (prohibiting the death penalty) required modification of the sentence to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Parole Eligibility:** No eligibility for parole.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines rape and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, leading to modification of the sentence.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. No. 147678-87:** Addresses the process of automatic review of cases with death penalty.
*   **Firaza v. People, G.R. No. 154721:** Relevant to consideration of affidavit of desistance presented post conviction
*   **People v. Garcia, G.R. No. 110990:** Addresses the requirements for an affidavit of desistance.
*   **People v. Junio, G.R. No. 110990:** Retractions of testimony in court have to be taken with a grain of salt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Areas:**

*   The true motivation behind AAA's affidavit is unclear, and questions about its genuineness.
*   The potential influence of BBB on AAA is alleged but not definitively proven.

**Conclusion:**

The Appellant faces significant obstacles in overturning the conviction. The affidavit of desistance is unlikely to be given significant weight due to its timing, substance, and questionable authenticity. The medical evidence and AAA's original testimony provide substantial support for the conviction. The main issue is the belated attempt of the victim to recant the charges and if the court will find it credible.
