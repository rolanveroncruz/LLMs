This legal document is a Supreme Court decision in *Belina Cancio and Jeremy Pampolina v. Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation* (G.R. No. 182307, June 6, 2018), concerning liability for unauthorized forex trading transactions.

**Key Provisions and Agreements:**

*   **Trust/Trading Facilities Agreement:** This agreement between Performance Forex and the petitioners authorized Performance Forex to act on instructions from the petitioners or their agent (Hipol), indemnifying Performance Forex from losses resulting from errors or irregularities in those instructions (Clause 6). It also stipulated that Performance Forex was not responsible for the actions, warranties, or representations of the commission agent (Hipol).
*   **Appointment of Agent Agreement:** This was between Hipol and the petitioners, where Hipol acted as the commission agent.
*   **Leverage Trading:** The petitioners utilized Performance Forex's credit line for leverage trading in forex.
*   **Purchase Order Forms:** Performance Forex policy purportedly required signed purchase order forms for each transaction.
*   **Pre-Signed Documents:** Cancio admitted to providing Hipol with pre-signed documents.

**Obligations:**

*   **Performance Forex:** Act on "bonafide" instructions from clients or their agents.
*   **Cancio and Pampolina:** Responsibility for the actions of their agent, Hipol.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Regional Trial Court (RTC):** Initially held Performance Forex and Hipol solidarily liable for damages due to Hipol's unauthorized transactions and Performance Forex's failure to disclose Hipol's past misconduct.
*   **Court of Appeals (CA):** Overturned the RTC decision, releasing Performance Forex from liability. The CA reasoned that Performance Forex was merely acting on instructions, that Cancio provided pre-signed authorizations, and that Performance Forex had no duty to disclose Hipol's prior misconduct as he was an independent broker.
*   **Supreme Court (SC):** Upheld the CA decision, denying the petition.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Broad Agent Authority:** The agreement's broad authorization given to Hipol and the provision exculpating Performance Forex from agent's actions pose significant risks for the petitioners.
*   **Bonafide Instructions Definition:** The dispute centered on whether Performance Forex sufficiently ensured instructions were "bonafide" despite the lack of corresponding Purchase Order Forms for all transactions and the existence of pre-signed forms.
*   **Duty to Disclose Prior Misconduct:** The CA and SC found no legal duty for Performance Forex to disclose Hipol's past misconduct, which the RTC deemed a failure to protect the client's interests.
*   **Reliance on Balance Ledger:** The petitioners relied on the balance ledger as evidence of unauthorized transactions, the SC found the argument flawed due to improper transaction counting.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs petitions for review on certiorari, which should only raise questions of law.  The Court discussed exceptions where factual findings can be reviewed, but found none applicable.
*   **Article 1900 of the Civil Code:** Pertains to the scope of an agent's authority as it affects third parties.
*   **Behn, Meyer, and Co. v. Nolting:** Defined the role of a broker as an independent negotiator.
*   **Securities and Exchange Commission v. Performance Foreign Exchange Corporation:** The SC pointed out that SEC was unsure whether the forex trading constitutes futures commodity trading
*   **Kierulf v. Court of Appeals:** The SC cited the need to show the existence of the factual basis of damages and its causal connection to defendant's acts

**Potential Arguments:**

*   **Petitioners (Cancio and Pampolina):** Argued that Performance Forex breached its contractual obligations by executing unauthorized trades without proper purchase order forms and by failing to disclose Hipol's past misconduct.  However, the SC pointed out that due to flawed transaction counting and signed purchase order forms for a number of transactions, they were unable to prove their case.
*   **Respondent (Performance Forex):** Contended that it was not liable for Hipol's actions because he was petitioners' agent, the petitioners granted him broad authority, and the trust agreement absolved it from agent liability.

**Conclusion:**

The SC sided with Performance Forex, emphasizing the risks inherent in forex leverage trading and the petitioners' responsibility for their agent's actions due to broad authorization and a clear contractual agreement. The case highlights the importance of carefully scrutinizing agent agreements and the risks associated with leverage trading.
