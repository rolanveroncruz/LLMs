## Legal Document Summary: *Villanueva v. Viloria* (G.R. No. 155804)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's decision which dismissed the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by Petitioners Villanueva. The case revolves around the issuance of a new owner's duplicate TCT and the subsequent sale of property, challenged due to alleged lack of jurisdiction and extrinsic fraud in the proceedings for the issuance of the duplicate title.

**Key Provisions and Events:**

*   **Petition for Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate:** Respondent Viloria, through his Attorney-in-Fact, filed a petition under Section 109 of P.D. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) for a new owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-16156, claiming the original was lost due to termite damage.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC granted the petition and ordered the Registry of Deeds to issue a new owner's duplicate title.
*   **Subsequent Transactions:** Viloria executed an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication as sole heir and subsequently sold the property to Ruben M. Marty, resulting in the cancellation of TCT No. T-16156 and issuance of TCT No. T-54657 in Marty's name.
*   **Petition for Annulment:** Petitioners Villanueva filed a petition for annulment of the RTC judgment, alleging lack of jurisdiction and extrinsic fraud, claiming they were the actual possessors and owners of the land and were not notified of the proceedings.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA dismissed the petition, finding that the RTC had jurisdiction as the requirements of Section 109 of P.D. 1529 were complied with. They rejected the claim of extrinsic fraud.
*   **SC Decision:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, finding that the RTC lacked jurisdiction because the original owner's duplicate was not actually lost, but was allegedly in the possession of the Petitioners Villanueva, who claimed they purchased the property from the late wife of the Respondent.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Viloria:** Had a legal obligation to truthfully represent the status of the original TCT. His alleged misrepresentation that it was lost when it was allegedly in the possession of the Petitioners forms the basis for the jurisdictional challenge.
*   **RTC:** Had a duty to ensure proper notice to all interested parties before ordering the issuance of a new duplicate title, as required under P.D. 1529.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Villanueva's Claim:** The core issue hinges on whether the Petitioners Villanueva validly purchased the property and hold the original owner's duplicate TCT. The SC relies on their claim as fact, but the validity of the sale is not fully litigated in this decision.
*   **Notice Requirements:** The lack of notice to Villanueva is central to the argument. Whether the notice requirements of P.D. 1529 were adequately met, given the Petitioners' alleged possession and ownership claim, is a significant point.
*   **Bona Fide Purchaser:** The rights of Ruben M. Marty, the purchaser, are implicated as his title is derived from the reconstituted title that has now been declared void. Marty's status as a *bona fide* purchaser for value without notice is not discussed and needs to be examined.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud vs. Lack of Jurisdiction:** The SC relies on *Strait Times, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* and *Demetriou v. Court of Appeals* to equate misrepresentation (though not extrinsic fraud) with a lack of jurisdiction. This is because the jurisdiction to order a replacement title is dependent on the fact that the original title actually is lost.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 109:** This statute governs the procedure for the issuance of new owner's duplicate certificates of title in case of loss or destruction.
*   **Rule 47, 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** This rule outlines the procedure for annulment of judgment.
*   ***Rexlon Realty Group Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: cited by Petitioners to support their claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction.
*   ***Strait Times, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*** and ***Demetriou v. Court of Appeals***: The SC relies heavily on these cases, applying the principle that a reconstituted title is void if the original is not actually lost but is in the possession of another party.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The central contentious point is the validity of the claim that the TCT was in the possession of the Petitioners at the time the petition was filed. The SC accepts this fact without further inquiry.
*   The SC seems to conflate a misrepresentation during a proceeding with a lack of jurisdiction.

**Legal Advice Required:**

*   Ascertain the legal standing of Ruben M. Marty as a *bona fide* purchaser.
*   Examine the validity of the sale between Cresencia P. Viloria (deceased) and the Petitioners.
*   Analyze the adequacy of the notice given in the reconstitution proceedings in relation to the Petitioners' possession of the property.
*   Research further the application of *Strait Times* and *Demetriou* in the context of jurisdictional challenges based on misrepresentation.
