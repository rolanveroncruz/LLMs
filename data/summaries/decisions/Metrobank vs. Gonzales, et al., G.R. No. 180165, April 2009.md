## Legal Document Summary: MBTC vs. Gonzales, Yao, and Yao (G.R. No. 180165)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Key Issue:** Whether probable cause exists to prosecute Oliver T. Yao and Diana T. Yao for estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 115 (Trust Receipts Law).

**Background:**

*   Visaland, represented by the Yaos, obtained 24 Letters of Credit from Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (MBTC).
*   The Yaos signed trust receipts obligating them to sell goods covered by the LCs and remit proceeds to MBTC, or return the goods if unsold.
*   Failure to remit proceeds or return goods led MBTC to file an estafa complaint.
*   The Secretary of Justice reversed the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause, directing the withdrawal of Informations, finding the transaction a simple loan, not subject to P.D. 115.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed the Secretary of Justice's decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Trust Receipts:** Yaos were entrusted with goods/documents under trust receipts, obligating them to either sell and remit proceeds or return the goods (P.D. 115, Section 4).
*   **Obligations of Entrustee:** Hold goods in trust, dispose of them per trust receipt terms, remit proceeds, insure goods, keep goods identifiable, return goods if unsold (Ching v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 164317, 6 February 2006).
*   **Estafa Liability:** Failure to fulfill trust receipt obligations constitutes estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code, as defined by Section 13 of P.D. 115.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** If found guilty of estafa, the Yaos face penalties under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Corporate Liability:** As representatives of Visaland, the Yaos could also trigger corporate liability, potentially extending penalties to directors, officers, and employees (P.D. 115, Section 13).
*   **Civil Liability:** Criminal conviction may also trigger civil liabilities arising from the offense.
*   **Risk:** Disagreement on the nature of contract. MBTC contends it is a trust receipt arrangement governed by PD 115; The Yaos assert the contract is one of loan secured by real estate mortgage outside the coverage of PD 115.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315(1)(b), Revised Penal Code:** Defines and punishes estafa.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 115 (Trust Receipts Law):** Governs trust receipt transactions and defines the crime of estafa related to violations thereof.

**Case Law:**

*   **Ching v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 164317, 6 February 2006:** Reinforces the obligations of the entrustee in a trust receipt transaction.
*   **Yu v. Sandiganbayan, 410 Phil. 619, 627 (2001):** Defines probable cause in preliminary investigation.
*   **Pilapil v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 101978, 7 April 1993, 221 SCRA 349, 360:** Defines sufficiency of evidence to procure a conviction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of the Transaction:** The central dispute is whether the transaction was a trust receipt agreement or a loan secured by a mortgage. The Yaos claim they were misled into signing documents, suggesting potential defenses of fraud or mistake.

**Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, reversed the Court of Appeals, and ordered the Secretary of Justice to direct the City Prosecutor to file Informations for estafa against the Yaos.
*   The Court held that the Secretary of Justice abused discretion by prematurely calibrating evidence, a function for the trial court.
*   The Court found probable cause based on trust receipts bearing the Yaos' signatures, a demand letter, and their initial admission of receiving the imported goods.
*   Court emphasized that failure to deliver proceeds or goods is *malum prohibitum* and that the evidentiary measure for propriety of filing criminal charges is merely probable cause and requires probability, not absolute or moral certainty.
