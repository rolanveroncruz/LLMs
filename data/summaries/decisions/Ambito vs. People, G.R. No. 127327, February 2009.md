*   **Respondents:** People of the Philippines and Court of Appeals.
*   **Private Complainant**: Pacific Star, Inc. (PSI)

**Key Provisions & Judgements:**

*   **Basilio Ambito (Violations of B.P. Blg. 22):**
    *   RTC convicted of seven (7) counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law).
    *   CA affirmed.
    *   **Supreme Court (SC) REVERSED** the B.P. Blg. 22 conviction due to the prosecution's failure to prove **actual receipt of notice of dishonor**. This is a crucial element for a B.P. Blg. 22 conviction. Cites *Bax v. People* and *Lao v. Court of Appeals* to emphasize the requirement of actual notice.
    *   **Civil liability affirmed**: Despite acquittal, the SC affirmed the RTC's order for Basilio Ambito to indemnify PSI for the value of the dishonored checks and associated interest due to preponderance of evidence.

*   **Liberata & Basilio Ambito (Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Documents):**
    *   RTC convicted of multiple counts of the complex crime of Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Documents (Articles 48, 171, 172, and 315 of the Revised Penal Code).
    *   CA affirmed.
    *   **SC AFFIRMED** the conviction.  The Court found that the issuance of unfunded Certificates of Time Deposit (CTDs) constituted falsification of commercial documents and was a necessary means to commit estafa by inducing PSI to part with its property. Cites *Monteverde v. People* and *Reyes, Revised Penal Code* to explain the nature of a Complex crime.
    *   **Key Elements Proven**: Deceit, Reliance, Damage.
    *   The *Court notes that the issuance of unfunded CCTD constituted* `making untruthful statements in narration of facts, legal obligation to disclose the truth, facts narrated by the offender are absolutely false and the perversion of truth was made with the wrongful intent to injure a third party.*`

*   **Crisanto Ambito (Falsification of Commercial Documents):**
    *   RTC convicted of two counts of Falsification of Commercial Documents (Articles 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code).
    *   CA affirmed.
    *   **SC AFFIRMED** the conviction.  No showing these CCTD were used to purchase farm implements from PSI.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Basilio Ambito:** Civil liability to PSI for the value of the dishonored checks plus interest.
*   **Liberata and Basilio Ambito:** Criminal liability for Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Documents, resulting in imprisonment and indemnity to PSI.
*   **Crisanto Ambito:** Criminal liability for Falsification of Commercial Documents, resulting in imprisonment and fines.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Notice of Dishonor:** Lack of written notice of dishonor was a fatal flaw in the B.P. Blg. 22 conviction, highlighting the critical importance of adhering to proper notice procedures in such cases.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The court emphasized the importance of the prosecution proving each element of the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt, otherwise the conviction would be overturned.
*   **Complex Crime:** The successful prosecution of the Ambitos for the complex crime of Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Documents hinged on the prosecution establishing that the Falsification of the commercial document was a necessary means of commiting the estafa.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law)**
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 48, 171, 172, 315.

**Conclusion:**

The SC partially granted the petition, acquitting Basilio Ambito of B.P. Blg. 22 violations due to lack of proof of notice of dishonor. However, the convictions of Liberata and Basilio Ambito for Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Documents, and Crisanto Ambito for Falsification of Commercial Documents, were affirmed. Significant civil liabilities remain. The case underscores the importance of complying with legal requirements for notice of dishonor in B.P.
