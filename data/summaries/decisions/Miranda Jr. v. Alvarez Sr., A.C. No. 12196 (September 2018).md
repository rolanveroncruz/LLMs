## Legal Document Summary: *Pablito L. Miranda, Jr. v. Atty. Jose B. Alvarez, Sr.* (A.C. No. 12196)

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Jose B. Alvarez, Sr. for violations of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC) and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Unauthorized Notarial Acts:** Respondent notarized documents in San Pedro, Laguna, despite his notarial commission being issued by RTC-Biñan and having expired for San Pedro. This violates Sections 3, Rule II of the Notarial Rules, limiting notarial acts to the commissioning court's territorial jurisdiction. _See Re: Violation of Rules on Notarial Practice, 751 Phil. 10, 15 (2015)._
*   **Incomplete Notarial Certificates:** Respondent notarized a Business Permit Application lacking details regarding the signatory's competent evidence of identity, violating the requirement to verify identity as per the Notarial Rules. _See Gaddi v. Velasco, 742 Phil. 810, 815-816 (2014)._
*   **Failure to Submit Notarial Reports:** Respondent failed to forward copies of notarized documents to the Clerk of Court, violating Section 2(h), Rule VI of the Notarial Rules. _See Peña v. Paterno, 710 Phil. 582, 595-596 (2013)._
*   **Prior Suspension:** A 5-month suspension (G.R. No. 126025) imposed in 2000, re-docketed as A.C. No. 9723 has not been lifted. Respondent is potentially practicing law despite this unresolved suspension, potentially violating the suspension order, and is directed to show cause. _See Ladim v. Ramirez, A.C. No. 10372, August 1, 2016; Maniago v. De Dios, 631 Phil. 139, 144-145 (2010)._

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Obligation to adhere to Notarial Rules and CPR.
*   Obligation to ensure valid notarial commission and territorial jurisdiction.
*   Obligation to verify signatory identity.
*   Obligation to submit required reports.
*   Obligation to disclose and comply with prior suspension.
*   Liability for violation of CPR, specifically Canon 1, Rule 1.01, and Canon 7.
*   Potential liability for contempt of court for practicing law while suspended.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** For practicing law while under suspension without proper reinstatement.
*   **Further Disciplinary Action:** Given the existing violations and potential contempt, further sanctions could be imposed.
