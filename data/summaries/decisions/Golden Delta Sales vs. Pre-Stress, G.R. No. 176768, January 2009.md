## Legal Document Summary: *Golden (Iloilo) Delta Sales Corporation v. Pre-Stress International Corporation, et al.*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging a CA decision affirming with modification an RTC decision in a case for Recovery of Personal Property with Prayer for Replevin with Damages (Civil Case No. 02-27020).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Golden (Iloilo) Delta Sales Corporation (Golden Delta)
*   **Respondents:** Pre-Stress International Corporation (PSI), Ze√±on Setias, Jerry Jardiolin

**Key Issue:** Ownership and right to possession of construction materials stored at PSI compound. Whether Golden Delta proved its case for replevin.

**Factual Background:** Golden Delta claims it stored construction materials at PSI's compound per an agreement. PSI denies such agreement; Jardiolin claims ownership of the materials. Golden Delta filed suit for replevin after being prevented from retrieving the materials. NBI seized materials with "Golden Delta" tags; qualified theft charges filed against PSI officers.

**RTC Ruling:** Dismissed Golden Delta's complaint, finding Golden Delta failed to prove ownership and entitlement to possession. Awarded significant damages to Setias and Jardiolin for attorney fees, moral and exemplary damages. Based judgment, partially, on a testimony of a former lover of the plaintiff's representative who painted him in a bad light. 

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed dismissal of Golden Delta's complaint but deleted the award of damages to Setias and Jardiolin and dismissed their counterclaim.  Found Golden Delta failed to prove ownership, but that the award for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees to Jardiolin and Setias lacked sufficient basis.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision, finding that Golden Delta proved it owned the items. The Court relied on the following considerations:

*   **Judicial Admissions:** PSI and Setias admitted Golden Delta delivered construction materials to the PSI compound, acknowledging Golden Delta as a supplier (Rule 129, Sec. 4; Rule 130, Sec. 26, *Herrera, Remedial Law, Vol. 5, pp. 107-108)*
*   **Voluminous Withdrawal Slips and Inventory Lists:** The CA ignored evidentiary value of these documents (Exhs. "G" to "CC") prepared *ante litem motam* (Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Ramos, G.R. No. 92740, March 23, 1992, 207 SCRA 461). Prepared by petitioner's employees, acting in the regular course of its business, made contemporaneously with the transaction, and in the performance of their regular duties without anticipation of any future litigation which may arise between petitioner and PSI.
*   **Documentary Evidence:** Certifications and invoices of purchase and shipment from suppliers to Golden Delta (Exhs. "KKK" to "OOO")
*   **Metal Tags:** Tags bearing "Golden Delta" attached to seized materials (Exhs. "JJ," "KK," "LL")
*   **Witness Testimony:** Testimony of customers (Arman Zarragosa and Rudy Yap) and Golden Delta personnel regarding deliveries and withdrawals.
*   **Conflicting Claims of Ownership:** Jardiolin and PSI made inconsistent claims about ownership of the materials in different pleadings.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Replevin (Rule 60, Revised Rules of Court):**  The SC implicitly found Golden Delta met the requisites for replevin despite the lower courts' contrary findings, highlighting the burden of proof.
*   **Ownership of Personal Property:**  The central issue revolves around proving ownership through documentary evidence, witness testimony, and admissions.
*   **Judicial Admissions (Rule 129, Sec. 4):**  Respondents were bound by admissions in their pleadings.
*   **Res Gestae (Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Ramos, G.R. No. 92740, March 23, 1992, 207 SCRA 461):** Documents prepared by Golden Delta's staff during the regular course of business.
*   **Damages:** Initially, the RTC awarded significant damages to the respondents, later removed by the CA; The SC held that the respondents should return the materials to the petitioner, or indemnify them.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Absence of Formal Storage Agreement:** The lack of a formal written storage agreement led to conflicting interpretations of the arrangement.
*   **"Presumed" Ownership:** The CA's conclusion regarding Jardiolin's "presumed" ownership highlighted the difficulty in ascertaining ownership based on circumstantial evidence and the court's misappreciation of the weight of the petitioner's evidence.
*   **Trial Court Judge Bias:** Golden Delta raised concerns about the trial judge's alleged bias due to familial relationship with PSI's counsel.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.
*   **Rule 60, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs actions for replevin.
*   **Rule 129, Sec. 4, Rules of Court:** Judicial Admissions.
*   **Rule 130, Sec. 26, Rules of Court:** Judicial Admissions.
*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Ramos, G.R. No. 92740, March 23, 1992, 207 SCRA 461:**  Regarding documentary evidence and *res gestae*.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, finding that Golden Delta proved its ownership of the construction materials through various evidence, including judicial admissions, documentary evidence, and witness testimony. The decision emphasizes the importance of weighing all available evidence and the binding nature of judicial admissions in determining ownership disputes. It also suggests that the lower courts failed to properly appreciate the volume of evidence submitted.
