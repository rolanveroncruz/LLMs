Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Name:** *Marilyn L. Go Ramos-Yeo, et al. v. Spouses Richard O. Chua, et al.* G.R. No. 236075 & G.R. No. 236076, November 5, 2018.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division (Tijam, J.)

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Amended Decision in an *accion reivindicatoria* case.  The core issue revolves around the RTC's jurisdiction to effectively amend Torrens titles in a non-land registration proceeding.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Chua filed an *accion reivindicatoria* against Century Trading Inc. claiming overlap of properties.
*   A court-ordered resurvey revealed errors in the original cadastral survey affecting multiple adjoining lot owners, including the Gos and Multi-Realty.
*   The RTC *sua sponte* amended the complaint *ad cautela*, impleading the Gos and Multi-Realty, who were later declared in default.
*   The RTC issued an Amended Decision identifying the properties, which effectively altered the boundaries described in existing Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs).
*   The Gos, upon discovering encroachment by the Spouses Chua, filed an Amended Petition for Annulment of Judgment. Multi-Realty separately filed a Petition.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC's decision, stating that the RTC did not amend the TCTs, but merely identified properties using correct tie-lines.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction over the Person (Gos):** The Supreme Court (SC) found that the RTC did *not* acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the Gos due to *invalid substituted service of summons*.  The Sheriff's Return lacked specific details of diligent efforts to achieve personal service (at least 3 attempts on 2 different dates) and failed to adequately describe the recipient of the summons (Patricio Alampay) as a person of "suitable age and discretion" residing at the defendant's residence. The court cited the case of *Ma. Imelda M. Manotoc vs. Court of Appeals, et al.* 530 Phil. 454 (2006) for the requirements of effective substituted service.
    *   *Risk:*  Defective service of summons renders all subsequent proceedings, including the judgment, void.

2.  **Jurisdiction over the Subject Matter:** The SC held that the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the action, despite being framed as an *accion reivindicatoria*, was in essence a collateral attack on the validity of existing Torrens titles and an attempt to reopen and review a final decree of registration outside of a proper land registration proceeding.  The prayer in the amended complaint seeks for "resurvey" and "amending the tie-lines" which effectively seeks for amendments in the certificate of title. This is impermissible in an ordinary civil action.
    *   *Case Law:* *Paz v. Rep. of the Phils., et al.,* 611 Phil. 78, 85-86, (2011).
    *   *Statutory References:*
        *   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 32:**  Prohibits reopening or revising a decree of registration after one year, except for actual fraud.
        *   **PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 108:** Governs amendment and alteration of certificates of title but does not allow reopening the judgment or decree of registration.
    *   *Risk:* A judgment rendered without jurisdiction over the subject matter is void and subject to collateral attack. *Heirs of Julian Dela Cruz and Leonora Talaro v. Heirs of Alberto Cruz*, 512 Phil. 389 (2005).

3.  **Impermissible Amendment:** The SC found that the RTC's Amended Decision resulted in *material alterations to the boundaries* of the properties owned by the Gos and Multi-Realty, going beyond mere clerical corrections.  The Court notes Spouses Chua themselves admitted in their opposition that the complaint was only for recovery of possession and not a land registration case, which is an implicit admission that the trial court has no jurisdiction in correction of certificates of title.

4.  **Laches:** The SC ruled that neither the Gos nor Multi-Realty are barred by laches. Because the RTC lacked jurisdiction, the judgment is void, and laches cannot cure a void judgment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The characterization of the action as solely an *accion reivindicatoria* versus an indirect attempt to amend titles was a key point of contention. The SC determined that the true nature of the action, as evidenced by the relief sought, implicated the exclusive jurisdiction of land registration courts. The Court also found that by amending the boundaries, the RTC in effect amended the certificates of titles which is not permissible.

**Obligations & Liabilities:** The case primarily addresses jurisdictional issues and does not establish specific monetary obligations or liabilities beyond potential damages claims related to the encroachment/construction activities.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petitions, reversed the CA's decision, and annulled all proceedings in Civil Case No. TG-893 and CA-G.R. SP No. 50922. The Register of Deeds of Tagaytay City was ordered to cancel any amendments made to the TCTs of the Gos and Multi-Realty and reinstate the original boundaries.
