## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Bernardino, G.R. No. 171088, October 02, 2009

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming convictions for illegal sale and illegal possession of *shabu* under Sections 15 and 16, Article III of R.A. No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by R.A. No. 7659.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 15, Article III of R.A. No. 6425 (Illegal Sale):** Penalizes the sale and/or delivery of *shabu* without authority. Requires proof of (a) buyer and seller identity, object, and consideration; and (b) delivery and payment. *Corpus delicti* is crucial.
*   **Section 16, Article III of R.A. No. 6425 (Illegal Possession):** Penalizes possession or use of regulated drugs without a license or prescription. Requires proof of (a) possession; (b) lack of authority; and (c) knowledge that the drug is regulated.

**Accusations:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 96-530:** Illegal possession of approximately 215 grams of *shabu*.
*   **Criminal Case No. 96-533:** Illegal sale of approximately 5 grams of *shabu* in a buy-bust operation.

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant was arrested in a buy-bust operation. Police testimony alleges a transaction facilitated by an asset, followed by arrest and seizure of additional drugs. The defense claims frame-up, alleging the accused was a "sacrificial lamb."

**Court's Ruling (Supreme Court):**

*   Affirms the accused-appellant’s conviction for illegal possession of *shabu* in violation of Section 16, Article III of R.A. No. 6425, as amended.
*   Acquits the accused-appellant of illegal sale of *shabu* penalized under Section 15, Article III of R.A. No. 6425 on the ground of reasonable doubt.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Illegal Possession:** Accused-Appellant is sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of P1,000,000.00 for possession of 211.23 grams of *shabu*.
*   **Illegal Sale:** Accused-Appellant is acquitted.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** While generally established, a significant evidentiary gap existed. Specifically, the Supreme Court found a failure to specifically identify which *shabu* was *sold* in the buy-bust, versus that found in the accused’s possession.
*   **Proof of Corpus Delicti (Illegal Sale):**  The Supreme Court deemed the prosecution failed to specifically identify the *shabu* that was actually sold at the buy-bust as among the *shabu* that were presented in court. This lack of segregation of evidence relating to the two separate crimes was problematic. This resulted in a lack of proof of *corpus delicti*.
*   **Markings:** The lack of distinction in markings on seized items made it difficult to differentiate the *shabu* sold from the *shabu* possessed, creating ambiguity and contributing to the acquittal on the sale charge.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended by R.A. No. 7659:** Defines and penalizes offenses related to dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Uy, G.R. No. 128046, March 7, 2000, 327 SCRA 335:** Sets out the requirements for a successful prosecution for illegal sale of shabu
*   **People v. Nuñez, G.R. No. 177148, June 30, 2009:** Sets out the requirements for a successful prosecution for illegal possession of shabu
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 640:** procedural matter regarding appeals of criminal cases.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for illegal possession of *shabu* based on sufficient evidence of possession, lack of authority, and knowledge. However, it overturned the conviction for illegal sale due to a critical failure to specifically identify the *shabu* sold in the buy-bust operation. The ruling highlights the importance of meticulously documenting the chain of custody and segregating evidence for distinct charges in drug cases.
