**Legal Document Summary: *Natividad Uy v. Atty. Braulio RG Tansinsin* (A.C. No. 8252)**

**Nature of Document:** Resolution in a disbarment case.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Complainant (Uy) hired Respondent (Atty. Tansinsin) to defend her in an ejectment case.
*   Atty. Tansinsin failed to file a required Position Paper in the MTC and a Memorandum on Appeal in the RTC.
*   The RTC dismissed Uy's appeal due to the failure to file the Memorandum.
*   Uy filed a disbarment complaint alleging gross negligence and incompetence.
*   Atty. Tansinsin admitted representing Uy but claimed he wasn't paid and knew the ejectment case was weak due to the expired lease.
*   The IBP initially recommended a 6-month suspension, later modified to 3 months.
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's findings with a 3 month suspension.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Rule 18.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable."
*   **Rule 18.04, Canon 18, Code of Professional Responsibility:** "A lawyer shall keep the client informed of the status of his case and shall respond within a reasonable time to the client's request for information."
*   Duty to exercise ordinary diligence and reasonable care and skill to protect the client's interest (Villaflores v. Limos, A.C. No. 7504).

**Liabilities/Sanctions:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for three (3) months.
*   Stern warning against future similar misconduct.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Payment:** Atty. Tansinsin's claim of non-payment, while not excusing negligence, might have been a factor in the IBP's initial recommendation.
*   **Weakness of Case:** Atty. Tansinsin argued he knew the case was weak. The court did not find this an excuse for inaction, highlighting the duty to diligently pursue a client's cause regardless of its perceived merits.
*   **Subjective Assessment of "Reasonable Time":**  The interpretation of "reasonable time" in Rule 18.04 regarding responding to client inquiries can be subjective and fact-dependent.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 40, Section 7(b) of the Rules of Court:** Mandates the filing of a memorandum on appeal, and failure to do so is grounds for dismissal.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 18.03 & Rule 18.04, Canon 18.**
*   **Villaflores v. Limos, A.C. No. 7504, November 23, 2007:**  Reinforces the standard of diligence required of lawyers and the consequences of failing to meet that standard.
*   **Gonzales v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 151376, February 22, 2006:**  Emphasizes the mandatory nature of filing a memorandum on appeal.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

The Court emphasized that a lawyer's failure to file required pleadings and keep the client informed violates specific provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The decision clarifies that perceived weakness of a case does not excuse a lawyer's duty to act diligently on behalf of their client.
