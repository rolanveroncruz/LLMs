## Legal Document Summary: San Roque Power Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 203249)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc's decision dismissing San Roque Power Corporation's (SRPC) judicial claims for VAT refund on grounds of prematurity.

**Key Issue:** Whether SRPC's judicial claims were prematurely filed under Section 112(D) of the NIRC, considering the 120-day and 30-day periods, and the retroactive application of the *Aichi* ruling.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Section 112(D) [now 112(C)] of the NIRC:** Governs the periods for VAT refund claims, requiring the Commissioner to act within 120 days and granting the taxpayer 30 days to appeal to the CTA after denial or inaction.
*   **Section 112(A) of the NIRC:** Establishes the two-year prescriptive period for filing administrative claims.
*   **Section 4 of the NIRC** CIRâ€™s power to issue rulings
*   **Section 246 of the NIRC:** Deals with the non-retroactivity of rulings detrimental to taxpayers.
*   **Article 8 of the Civil Code:** Pertains to the legal system to adherence to judicial precedents.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc. (Aichi)***: Established the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day and 30-day periods in Section 112(D), barring premature judicial claims.
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation (San Roque)***: Upheld *Aichi* but created an exception for taxpayers relying on BIR Ruling DA-489-03.
*   ***BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03***: Stated that taxpayers need not wait for the 120-day period before seeking judicial relief. This was issued on December 10, 2003, and effectively reversed by Aichi on October 6, 2010.
*   ***Taganito Mining Corporation v. CIR*** clarified the period where taxpayer need not follow stringent 120-day period.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **120-day period:** Obligation on the CIR to process refund claims within 120 days.
*   **30-day period:** Obligation on the taxpayer to appeal to the CTA within 30 days of denial or inaction after the 120-day period.
*   **Taxpayer's Duty:** To administratively claim a refund of input VAT within two years from the close of the taxable quarter.
* Reliance on BIR Rulings: Section 246 of NIRC dictates that taxpayer acting in good faith based on BIR rulings, they shall not be prejudiced should that ruling be revoked

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   The Court acknowledges that the CTA En Banc erred in its decision, as it reverses the CTA Division for lack of jurisdiction.
*   Premature filing is subject to our ruling in *Aichi*, where an appeal is to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
*   Exception to the mandatory and jurisdiction nature of the 120-day period exists, as stated in *San Roque*.
*   *BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03*, is applicable to all taxpayers. During the window period from December 10, 2003 to October 6, 2010, a taxpayer need not wait for the exhaustion of the 120-day period before filing judicial claim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Retroactive Application of Aichi:** While the court affirms *Aichi*, it avoids its retroactive application to taxpayers who relied on BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, creating potential issues of equal protection for taxpayers outside the "window period." The definition and scope of this "window period" could be subject to future litigation.
*   **Reliance on BIR Rulings:** The good faith requirement for reliance on BIR rulings can be factually contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted SRPC's petition, reversing the CTA En Banc decision and reinstating the CTA Division's ruling to refund SRPC's unutilized input VAT. The Court recognizes the CTA's jurisdiction because SRPC's judicial claims fell within the window period established between the issuance of BIR Ruling DA-489-03 and the Aichi ruling, therefore SRPC is shielded from the vice of prematurity.
