**Case Summary: *Borromeo-Garcia v. Pagayatan*, A.M. NO. RTJ-08-2127**

This is an administrative matter concerning a complaint filed by Cita Borromeo-Garcia against Judge Ernesto P. Pagayatan alleging falsification, partiality, dishonesty, gross incompetence, evident bad faith, immorality, and grave misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Falsification (as Register of Deeds):** Allegation that Judge Pagayatan, while Register of Deeds, facilitated the transfer of 165 titles based on falsified signatures, receiving 20 titles as payment. This involves potential violations of the Revised Penal Code, specifically Article 171 (Falsification by Public Officer). The complainant failed to provide any solid evidence such as copies of the documents containing forged signatures.
*   **Falsification & Partiality (as Judge):** Allegation that Judge Pagayatan improperly granted a petition for the issuance of owner's duplicate copies of 62 TCTs to Borromeo, Jr. (illegitimate son), knowing he wasn't the owner. This implicates potential violations of the New Civil Code provisions regarding inheritance and property rights, as well as the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), specifically Section 109 (Reconstitution of lost or destroyed duplicate certificates).
*   **Immorality & Grave Misconduct:** Allegation of an illicit relationship with Elsa Aguirre, an acting clerk of court and ex-wife of Borromeo, Jr., and claims that Aguirre and a prosecutor were Judge Pagayatan's "bagmen." This constitutes a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Canons 3 and 4, as cited by the Supreme Court. This could also potentially be interpreted as indirect bribery, depending on evidence not provided in the complaint.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Pagayatan's Duty:** The primary obligation is for Judge Pagayatan to uphold the law impartially and maintain the appearance of impartiality, as mandated by the New Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   **Penalties:** Though initially facing possible dismissal, the court dismissed all of the charges with the exception of violating Canon 3 Section 2 and Canon 4 Section 1 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, and he was ultimately fined P10,000.00, deducted from his retirement benefits. This highlights the Court's emphasis on judicial integrity and avoidance of even the *appearance* of impropriety.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 109 regarding reconstitution of titles is relevant.
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Article 171 is relevant if the falsification allegations as Register of Deeds are substantiated.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct (Canons 3 & 4):** Foundation for the finding of impropriety based on appearance of partiality.
*   ***Domingo v. Pagayatan*, A.M. No. RTJ-03-1751:** Cited as precedent regarding prior disciplinary action against Judge Pagayatan.
*   **Dayag v. Gonzales, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1903, June 27, 2006, 493 SCRA 51:** Relevant as it defines that the complainant has the burden of proving the allegations in their complaint with substantial evidence and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption is that respondent has regularly performed his duties.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Hearsay:** Much of the complainant's evidence relies on hearsay (statements by deceased or unavailable witnesses). This weakens the case significantly.
*   **Subjectivity of "Appearance of Partiality":** While the court emphasizes the need to avoid the appearance of partiality, the determination of what constitutes such an appearance is subjective and fact-dependent. The mere association with the ex-wife of a litigant, while considered unprocedural, may not always warrant disciplinary action, making this a potentially contentious area.
*   **Lack of Direct Evidence of Falsification:** The failure to produce copies of the allegedly falsified documents is a significant weakness in the complainant's case regarding the Register of Deeds allegations.

**Conclusion:**

The court ultimately dismissed the most serious allegations against Judge Pagayatan due to lack of evidence. However, the finding of guilt based on the appearance of impropriety, even without direct evidence of actual bias, underscores the high ethical standards expected of judges. The fine imposed, though relatively small, serves as a warning against any conduct that could undermine public confidence in the judiciary. It is important to note that the complainant held the burden of proof and was unable to provide sufficient evidence.
