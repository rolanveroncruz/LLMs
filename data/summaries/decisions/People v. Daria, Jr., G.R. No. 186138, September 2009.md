## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Daria, Jr.* (G.R. No. 186138)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Loreto Daria, Jr. for violations of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Accused was charged with (1) selling 0.46 gram of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer (PO1 Bantog) and (2) possessing 1.11 grams of *shabu* found on his person.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** PO1 Bantog acted as poseur-buyer, purchased *shabu* from accused, and then arrested him.  The buy-bust money was marked with his initials "VSB." Additional *shabu* was found on the accused during a search incident to arrest.
*   **Evidence Presented:** Testimony of PO1 Bantog, affidavit of arrest, request for laboratory examination, chemistry report confirming the substance was *shabu*, and the buy-bust money.
*   **Defense:** Accused claimed illegal arrest and frame-up, alleging police demanded money for his release and that the drugs and money were planted by PO1 Orig. He claimed previous filing of a complaint against some of the arresting officers. Sister-in-law testified to corroborate his story.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC found accused guilty on both counts. CA affirmed.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused had an obligation not to sell or possess dangerous drugs in violation of RA 9165.
*   Police officers had an obligation to follow proper procedures in conducting the buy-bust operation and preserving the chain of custody of the evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused held liable for *illegal sale* Life imprisonment and P500,000 fine.
*   Accused held liable for *illegal possession*: Imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 14 years, and a fine of P300,000.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Procedural Rules:** Accused argued that failure to follow procedures, such as pre-operation reports, PDEA coordination, photography/inventory, and mandatory drug test, made the apprehension irregular.
*   **Defense of Frame-Up:**  Accused claimed the police had a motive to frame him due to a previous complaint he filed against them.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of specific details in PO1 Bantog's testimony (e.g., which pocket the drugs were retrieved from, exact quantity purchased) was raised by the defense, but the Court deemed this a minor, inconsequential detail that did not affect the overall credibility of his testimony.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding that the elements of the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The chain of custody of the drugs was sufficiently established, and the defense of frame-up was not supported by convincing evidence. The Court upheld the sentences imposed by the lower courts.
