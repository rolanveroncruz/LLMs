## Legal Document Summary: *Welbilt Construction Corp. v. Heirs of De Castro*

**Document:** Supreme Court Decision, G.R. No. 210286, July 23, 2018, concerning the validity of an extra-judicial foreclosure of a condominium unit.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Welbilt Construction Corp., Wack Wack Condominium Corp., and Spouses Eugenio Juan Gonzalez and Matilde Gonzalez (Condominium Developer/Management).
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Cresenciano C. De Castro (Condominium Unit Owner).

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure of De Castro's condominium unit null and void due to the lack of sufficient authority by the Petitioners.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   De Castro owned Unit 802, subject to a registered Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions.
*   De Castro failed to pay assessment dues, leading to the annotation of a lien on his title pursuant to Section 4 of the Master Deed.
*   Petitioners initiated extra-judicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135 and the Condominium Act.
*   Petitioners emerged as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sale.
*   De Castro (later his Heirs) challenged the foreclosure, arguing lack of authority, excessive assessments, and procedural irregularities.
*   The RTC upheld the validity of the foreclosure.
*   The CA reversed the RTC, relying on *First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v. Gatmaytan* (579 Phil. 432 (2008)) and finding that Petitioners lacked explicit authority to foreclose.

**Ruling/Legal Analysis:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, finding the foreclosure valid.
*   SC distinguished *First Marbella*, noting that *First Marbella* only had notice of assessment as authority; whereas here, the foreclosure was based not only on the Condominium Act (RA 4726), but the Master Deed, and the condominium corporation's By-Laws.
*   SC cited Section 20 of the Condominium Act regarding liens and enforcement through judicial or extra-judicial foreclosure. This must be read with Act No. 3135 for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   SC highlighted that the Condominium Corporation's By-Laws authorized the Board of Directors to enforce collection of unpaid assessments via foreclosure, and that such authority was properly delegated.
*   SC also highlighted that Condo Association’s Board Resolution No. 84-007, which De Castro signed as a member of the Board of Directors at that time, authorized foreclosure for delinquent accounts and appointed Arch. Eugenio Juan Gonzalez as attorney-in-fact for that purpose.
*   SC referred to *Wack Wack Condominium Corp. v. Court of Appeals* (290 Phil. 357 (1992)), which had already established authority.

**Obligations:**

*   Condominium unit owners are obligated to pay assessments according to the Master Deed and By-Laws.
*   The Condominium Corporation has an obligation to provide proper notice and follow due process in foreclosure proceedings.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to pay assessments can lead to foreclosure of the condominium unit.
*   Improper foreclosure proceedings may lead to liability for damages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity regarding "special power or authority":** While the Master Deed, By-Laws, and Board Resolution collectively establish authority, the issue revolves around the level of specificity required for this authority.
*   **Reasonableness of Assessments:** While the Court did not focus on it here, an argument could be made that the assessments were unreasonable and thus, the lien was improperly asserted.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 4726 (Condominium Act)
*   Act No. 3135 (Extra-Judicial Foreclosure)
*   A.M. No. 99-10-05-0 (Procedure in Extra-Judicial or Judicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage)
*   Circular No. 7-2002 (Guidelines for the Enforcement of A.M. No. 99-10-05-0)

**Case Law:**

*   *First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v. Gatmaytan* (579 Phil. 432 (2008)) – Distinguished, not applicable due to presence of Master Deed, Condo By-Laws and Board Resolution here.
*   *Wack Wack Condominium Corp. v. Court of Appeals* (290 Phil. 357 (1992)) – Affirmed the authority of the condominium corporation to foreclose.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the validity of the extra-judicial foreclosure, finding that the Condominium Corporation possessed sufficient authority through the Master Deed, By-Laws, and Board Resolution to enforce the lien and foreclose on the delinquent unit owner's property. The decision clarifies that a specific "special power of attorney" is not necessarily required when other documents collectively establish the necessary authority to foreclose under Act No. 3135 and the Condominium Act. However, the reasonableness of the assessment itself could potentially be challenged in a separate action.
