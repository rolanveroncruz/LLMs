## Legal Document Summary: Pascua v. Bankwise, Inc. and Philippine Veterans Bank (G.R. Nos. 191460 & 191464)

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision regarding constructive dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Whether Perfecto Pascua was constructively dismissed, and if so, whether Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB) should be solidarily liable with Bankwise, Inc. for his money claims.

**Holding:** Pascua was *not* constructively dismissed. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision, absolving both Bankwise and PVB from Pascua's money claims.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The SC defined constructive dismissal as a situation where an employee is compelled to resign or has no other choice but to resign. An unconditional resignation letter is *not* indicative of constructive dismissal if submitted with full awareness of its effects. Cites *Peñaflor v. Outdoor Clothing Manufacturing Corporation, 624 Phil. 490 (2010)*.

*   **Voluntary Resignation:** The SC emphasized that an employee's actions before and after the resignation are crucial in determining intent. In this case, Pascua tendered an unconditional resignation letter, negating the claim of constructive dismissal. The court considers Pascua's high-ranking position and presumed understanding of the ramifications of the document he signed. Cites *Nationwide Security and Allied Services, Inc. v. Valderama, 659 Phil. 362, 371 (2011)*.

*   **Burden of Proof:** While the employer generally bears the burden of proving just cause for dismissal or voluntariness of resignation (*Peñaflor v. Outdoor Clothing Manufacturing Corporation*), here, Pascua's unconditional resignation letter shifted the focus to whether external factors rendered his action involuntary, which the Court found lacking.

*   **Severance Pay:** Since Pascua voluntarily resigned, he is not entitled to separation pay unless it was previously stipulated in the employment contract or has become an established company policy (*CJC Trading v. National Labor Relations Commission, 316 Phil. 887 (1995)*). Pascua's contract did not provide for this, and no company policy was proven.

*   **Verbal Agreements:** Clause 8 of Pascua's employment contract expressly states that no verbal agreement can alter the contract terms unless reduced in writing and signed by both parties. This is a key factor, as Pascua relied on alleged verbal assurances from Bankwise officers regarding severance pay.

*   **NLRC Procedural Issue:** Bankwise argued the NLRC decision was not final because its Motion for Reconsideration was not explicitly addressed. The SC held that the NLRC's March 14, 2008 Resolution implicitly denied both motions, and the subsequent issuance of a writ of execution indicated finality against Bankwise.

*   **PVB's Liability:** Because constructive dismissal was not established, the issue of PVB's solidary liability became moot. The Court did not rule on the validity of the Memorandum of Agreement between PVB and Bankwise or the potential liabilities arising from it.

*   **Legal Compensation:** Bankwise raised legal compensation as a defense due to Pascua's outstanding loan obligations. However, the Court does not address this defense because no liability for backwages, separation pay and attorney’s fees was established.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Resignation Letter:** The decision heavily relies on the explicit wording of Pascua's resignation letter, potentially setting a precedent where companies can easily escape liability by obtaining seemingly unconditional resignations.

*   **Unequal Bargaining Power:** While the court acknowledged that the presumption of employer-employee inequality may be diminished in cases involving high-ranking employees (*Fuji Television Network v. Espiritu, 749 Phil. 388 (2014)*), there is a risk that employees could still be pressured into resigning despite their qualifications.

*   **Liquidation:** The ongoing liquidation of Bankwise could complicate any potential recovery of funds, even if the court had ruled in Pascua's favor.
