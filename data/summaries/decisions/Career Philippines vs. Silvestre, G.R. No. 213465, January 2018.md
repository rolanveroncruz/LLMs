## Legal Document Summary: *Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Donard P. Silvestre* (G.R. No. 213465)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision granting seafarer Donard P. Silvestre permanent disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees.

**Key Issue:** Whether Silvestre is entitled to permanent and total disability benefits under the POEA-SEC despite: (1) the company-designated physician's alleged fitness-to-work assessment within the 240-day period; (2) his supposed willful negligence contributing to his injury; and (3) an opinion from Silvestre's private doctor indicating a Grade 9 partial disability.

**Holding:** Petition DENIED with modifications. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, granting Silvestre disability benefits but adjusting the sickness allowance.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC (2000), Sec. 20(B):** Governs compensation for work-related injury or illness.
    *   Employer's liability for medical treatment, sickness allowance, and disability benefits.
    *   120-day period for company-designated physician to determine fitness to work or degree of disability.
*   **POEA-SEC, Sec. 20(D):** No compensation payable for injury/disability resulting from the seafarer's *willful or criminal act or intentional breach of duties*.
    *   Employer bears the burden to prove causation.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 192(c)(1):** Defines permanent total disability as temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than 120 days (subject to IRR exceptions).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Career Philippines Shipmanagement, Inc., Columbia Shipmanagement Ltd. Liberia, and Sampaguita D. Marave (Petitioners):** Jointly and severally liable for:
    *   US$60,000.00 permanent disability benefit.
    *   US$186.34 (previously US$1,720.00, as the seafarer has already been paid US$1,533.66) sickness allowance.
    *   Attorney's fees (10% of total monetary award).
    *   Interest at 6% per annum from finality of judgment until full satisfaction (*Nacar v. Gallery Frames*).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Willful or Intentional Breach of Duty" (Sec. 20(D), POEA-SEC):**  The Petitioners argued the seafarer's failure to secure the safety pin constituted gross negligence and barred recovery. SC rejected this, finding no evidence of *willful* intent.
*   **Application of the 120/240-Day Rule:** The Petitioners asserted the company-designated physician declared Silvestre fit to work within 240 days (*Vergara v. Hammonia*). The SC found no sufficient justification for extending the initial 120-day period. A late assessment is considered a failure to comply, and the permanent and total award is proper.
*   **Conflict Between Company-Designated Physician and Seafarer's Physician:** The Petitioner argued the seafarer's physician finding Grade 9 partial disability should control. The SC held that the lack of a timely assessment by the company-designated physician within the proper time frames results in permanent and total disability, negating the seafarer's doctor's assessment.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. (588 Phil. 895):**  Petitioners initially relied on this to argue for the 240-day period for medical assessment. *Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue* clarified this interpretation.
*   **Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue (765 Phil. 341):**  Clarified that the company-designated physician must provide sufficient justification to extend the 120-day assessment period to 240 days.
*   **Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias (773 Phil. 428):** Summarizes the key aspects of the applicable timeframes.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames (716 Phil. 267):** Applied to impose 6% interest on the monetary award from the finality of judgment.
*   **Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munor (702 Phil. 717):** Lack of a final medical assessment transforms a temporary disability to permanent disability, irrespective of the disability grade.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 2208, paragraph 8:** Justification for the award of attorney's fees.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Sufficient Justification" for Extending the 120-Day Period:**  The parameters of what constitutes "sufficient justification" are fact-dependent and could be subject to further litigation.
*   **Application of Safety Rule Violation Exception:** The interpretation of what constitutes a "willful or criminal act or intentional breach of duties" may be contested in future cases.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA decision with a modification related to the Sickness Allowance because part of it was already paid. This case underscores the importance of the company-designated physician issuing a timely and well-justified medical assessment within the prescribed periods. The SC emphasized the employer's burden to prove the seafarer's willful negligence.
