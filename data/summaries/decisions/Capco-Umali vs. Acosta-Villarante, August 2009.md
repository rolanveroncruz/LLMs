**Case Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-08-2124 & RTJ-08-2125**

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases involving reciprocal complaints between Judge Rizalina Capco-Umali and retired Judge Paulita B. Acosta-Villarante for violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Judge Capco-Umali's Complaint (RTJ-08-2124):** Judge Acosta-Villarante violated Canon 2, Section 2 and Canon 4, Sections 1 & 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. Specifically, Judge Capco-Umali took exception to statements made in a memorandum penned by Judge Acosta-Villarante addressed to the Executive Judge, accusing Judge Capco-Umali of conduct unbecoming a judge, uttering unsavory remarks designed to humiliate Judge Acosta-Villarante, and attempting physical harm.
*   **Judge Acosta-Villarante's Complaint (RTJ-08-2125):** Judge Capco-Umali violated Canon 4, Sections 1 & 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct. Arising from the same incident, Judge Acosta-Villarante accused Judge Capco-Umali of grave oral defamation and grave threats. The dispute stemmed from a meeting where the issue of local allowances for judges was discussed, leading to heated exchanges between the two.
*   **Underlying Facts:** The conflict originated from discrepancies in local allowances received by the judges, and allegations that Judge Acosta-Villarante was receiving additional funds without proper authorization. This was discussed during a courtesy call to the City Mayor and subsequently at a judges' meeting.
*   **Admissions:** Both judges admitted to uttering offensive remarks during the altercation: Judge Capco-Umali admitted to saying "Matanda ka na, halos malapit ka na sa kamatayan gumagawa ka pa ng ganyan, madadamay pa kami" (You're old, almost at the point of death, and you're still doing things like this, we'll get dragged into it) and "Judge ako! Judge ako!" (I'm a Judge! I'm a Judge!). Judge Acosta-Villarante admitted to calling Judge Capco-Umali "sinungaling" (liar).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Both judges have an obligation to uphold the New Code of Judicial Conduct, particularly Canon 4, Section 1: "Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities."
*   Both judges were found liable for violating Canon 4, Section 1.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The subjective interpretation of "impropriety" and "appearance of impropriety" could be a point of contention.
*   The decision hinges on the admissions of both judges regarding their conduct.
*   Judge Acosta-Villarante's memorandum, specifically the underlined statements, served as the basis for Judge Capco-Umali's complaint for libel, adding another layer of complexity.
*   Whether the circulation of the memorandum by Judge Acosta-Villarante was justified or a violation of the Code.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary (A.M. No. 03-05-01-SC):** Basis for the charges.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC):** Provides the classification of offenses and penalties. A violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct is classified as serious only if it amounts to gross misconduct. Since the misconduct was not considered "gross" a less serious charge was warranted.
*   **Quiroz vs. Orfila (272 SCRA 324 [1997]):** Cited to illustrate that fighting between court employees during office hours is disgraceful and reflects poorly on the judiciary.
*   **Alumbres vs. Caoibes, A.M. No. RTJ-99-1431, January 23, 2002** Constant reminder to judges.
*    **Re: Fighting Incident Between Two (2) SC Drivers, Namely, Messrs. Edilberto L. Idulsa and Ross C. Romero, A.M No. 2008-24-SC, July 14, 2009; Nacionales v. Madlangbayan, A.M. No. P-06-2171, June 15, 2006, 490 SCRA 538, 545.** Similar violations of the judicial system.

**Decision:**

*   Both judges were found GUILTY of violating Section 1, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   Each was fined P11,000.
*   For Judge Acosta-Villarante, the amount was deducted from her retirement benefits due to her compulsory retirement.
*   Both judges were sternly warned against repetition of similar acts.
