## Legal Document Summary: *The Ombudsman vs. Peliño* (G.R. No. 179261)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which permanently enjoined the Ombudsman from enforcing a preventive suspension order against respondent Peliño.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charges against Peliño:** Eighteen counts of perjury (Art. 183, RPC), violation of RA 6713 (SALN filing), dishonesty and grave misconduct (Omnibus Rules), and violation of RA 1379 (unexplained wealth).
*   **Unexplained Wealth:** Allegation of illegally acquired properties and investments disproportionate to Peliño's income, including undisclosed real estate, a condominium, vehicles, and interests in a company.
*   **SALN Discrepancies:** Failure to declare properties in SALNs and Personal Data Sheet (PDS), specifically a "son" and various assets.
*   **Preventive Suspension:** Ombudsman issued a 6-month preventive suspension order based on strong evidence of guilt, pending administrative proceedings (RA 6770, Sec. 24).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **SALN Filing (RA 6713, Sec. 8):** Public officials must truthfully declare assets, liabilities, and net worth. Failure to do so carries penalties, including imprisonment, fine, and disqualification from public office (Sec. 11).
*   **Disclosure of Business Interests (RA 6713, Rule VII):** Obligation to disclose business interests and financial connections.
*   **Truthfulness in PDS:** Public officials must provide accurate information in their PDS.
*   **Liability for Unexplained Wealth (RA 1379, Sec. 2):** Public officials acquiring property disproportionate to their income face a prima facie presumption of unlawful acquisition.
*   **Accountability for Dishonesty:** Dishonesty is a grave offense under Civil Service laws, potentially leading to dismissal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Birth Certificate:** The core of Peliño's defense rests on challenging the authenticity of a birth certificate that names her as the mother of Cuaki. This public document holds presumptive validity (Cabais vs. Court of Appeals) and requires strong evidence to overturn. If proven false, Peliño might face charges related to falsification.
*   **Trustee Claims:** Peliño's claim that she holds certain properties in trust requires substantiation. The absence of supporting documents weakens this defense.
*   **Source of Funds:** Peliño attributes the source of funds for various acquisitions to financial support from Henry Go (now deceased) for Cuaki. Without concrete evidence, this is highly questionable.
*   **"Strong Evidence of Guilt" Standard (RA 6770, Sec. 24):** The Ombudsman's determination of "strong evidence of guilt" for preventive suspension is given deference. The court examines if this discretion was exercised with grave abuse, and if so the Ombudsman may lose their decision
*   **Immorality charge** The SC points out that as Cuaki was born to Alfonso, her coworker. An adulterous charge may also be levied against her

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Garcia v. Mojica:**  Strength of evidence for preventive suspension can be raised via certiorari.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan:** Elements for the presumption of unlawful acquisition under RA 1379.
*   **Burgos v. Aquino:** Omission of information in PDS can constitute perjury.
*   **Wooden v. Civil Service Commission:** Definition of dishonesty.
*   **Concerned Taxpayer v. Doblada & Montemayor v. Bundalian:**  Dismissal upheld for SALN violations and unexplained wealth.
*   **Buenaseda v. Flavier:** Ombudsman's discretion in determining "strong evidence" of guilt for preventive suspension is given deference.
*   **Cabais vs. Court of Appeals** Certificates of Live Birth constitutes prima facie evidence

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 183:** Perjury.
*   **Republic Act No. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (SALN requirements).
*   **Republic Act No. 1379:** Forfeiture of unlawfully acquired property.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770:** The Ombudsman Act of 1989 (Preventive Suspension).
*   **Executive Order No. 292:** Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, as amended by Civil Service Commission Circular No. 19, series of 1999 (Dishonesty and grave misconduct).
*   **Republic Act No. 3019** Anti Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
**Ambiguity and contentions**

* The burden of proof is to overturn a birth certificate
* Peliño's claim of "trustee" lacks evidence
* Fund source is not clear, and the source is now deceased.

**Summary of Ruling**

The SC reversed the CA decision, ruling that the Ombudsman did not act with grave abuse of discretion in ordering Peliño's preventive suspension. The SC found that evidence of Peliño's guilt was strong, considering her admissions, SALN discrepancies, and lack of credible explanations for her wealth accumulation. However, given that the administrative case has been submitted for resolution, the Court held that Peliño may no longer be placed under preventive suspension. The Ombudsman may continue investigation and pursue dismissal.
