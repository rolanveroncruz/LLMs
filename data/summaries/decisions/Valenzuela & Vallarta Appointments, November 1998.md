## Legal Document Summary: In Re Appointments Dated March 30, 1998 (358 Phil. 896)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court En Banc Decision (A.M. No. 98-5-01-SC) addressing the constitutionality of judicial appointments made during the election ban period under Section 15, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.

**Key Issue:** Whether the President is constitutionally prohibited from making judicial appointments during the ban period prescribed by Section 15, Article VII, despite the mandates in Sections 4(1) and 9 of Article VIII requiring the filling of judicial vacancies within specified timeframes.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that Section 15, Article VII, prohibiting appointments two months before presidential elections until the end of the President's term, takes precedence over Sections 4(1) and 9 of Article VIII regarding the filling of judicial vacancies.  Appointments made during the ban period are void.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Section 15, Article VII:**  "Two months immediately before the next presidential elections and up to the end of his term, a President or Acting President shall not make appointments, except temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety." The Court interpreted this as a general prohibition applying to *all* appointments, with a narrow exception for *temporary* appointments in the *executive* branch where public service would be prejudiced.
*   **Section 4(1), Article VIII:**  "The Supreme Court shall be composed of a Chief Justice and fourteen Associate Justices. ***. Any vacancy shall be filled within ninety days from the occurrence thereof."
*   **Section 9, Article VIII:**  President shall issue appointments for lower courts based on list from JBC. Section 4(1) & 9 requires President to fill vacancies in courts within a given time period.

**Rationale:**

*   The Court reasoned that the prohibition in Section 15, Article VII is aimed at preventing vote-buying and "midnight appointments" for partisan advantage, referencing *Aytona v. Castillo*, 114 Phil. vii (1962).
*   The intent of Sec. 15 Article VII is to prevent the "tying of the hands" of the incoming President via patronage appointments, and influence election outcomes
*   The Court found that policy to prevent vote buying should outweigh the need to prevent delay in filling court vacancies

**Key Obligations:**

*   President:  Prohibited from making judicial appointments (except for temporary appointments to executive positions meeting specific criteria) during the election ban period.
*   Judicial and Bar Council (JBC):  Deferred all action on nominations to fill vacancies during the legal proceedings.  Instructed to follow SC orders in regards to nominations

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   Individuals accepting appointments made in violation of Section 15, Article VII face potential legal challenges to their appointment and removal from office. This was demonstrated by the court declaring as void the appointments of Valenzuela and Vallarta

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution:**  Article VII, Section 15; Article VIII, Sections 4(1) and 9.
*   **Aytona v. Castillo, 114 Phil. vii (1962):** Addressed the concept of "midnight appointments" by an outgoing President.
*   **Omnibus Election Code:**  References prohibitions on vote buying and related election offenses (Section 261).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of the exception for "temporary appointments to executive positions when continued vacancies therein will prejudice public service or endanger public safety." This remains open to interpretation and could lead to litigation if the executive branch attempts to circumvent the ban.
*   Instance when such need for appointment cannot be covered either by Section 15 of Article VII, nor by Section 4(1) and 9 of Article VIII

**Conclusion:**

This decision clarifies the interplay between the constitutional provisions governing judicial appointments and the election ban, definitively establishing that the ban takes precedence.  This ruling restricts the President's power to make judicial appointments during the specified period.
