**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Lorenzo Oliva y Rosela*, G.R. No. 187043 (2009)

**Summary:** This is an appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Lorenzo Oliva for two counts of rape against his minor daughter. The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA's ruling, finding Oliva guilty beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) and 266-B(1) and Article 266-A(1)(d) and 266-B(1) of the Revised Penal Code (prior to its amendment).
*   **Facts:** Oliva was convicted of raping his 11-year-old daughter in March 2003 and again on September 9, 2003. The victim testified to the incidents, detailing the acts committed against her.
*   **Appellant's Defense:** Oliva denied the charges, claiming his wife told him the victim was molested by a relative and he was merely examining her vagina. The SC dismissed this as unbelievable. As to the second incident, he claimed he was asleep due to being drunk.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC initially sentenced Oliva to death for each count. The CA reduced the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* per count due to RA 9346 (prohibition of the death penalty). The SC affirmed this.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The SC reiterated the principle that factual findings of the trial court regarding the credibility of witnesses are given great weight. It further emphasized the trustworthiness of child victim testimonies in sexual assault cases.
*   **Evidentiary Standards:** The SC confirmed that the victim's testimony was credible and sufficient to establish the elements of rape. Minor discrepancies were deemed inconsequential to the gravamen of the offense. The appellant's denial lacked probative value compared to the victim's positive testimony.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Defendant (Oliva):** Obligation to serve *reclusion perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   **Defendant (Oliva):** Obligation to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
    *   Civil Indemnity: PHP 150,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: PHP 150,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: PHP 60,000.00
*   **State:** Enforces the sentence and ensures the victim's protection and well-being.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **No apparent ambiguity**: The court's interpretation of the facts and the application of the law seem clear.
*   **Reliance on testimony**: The case heavily relies on the victim's testimony. While the court gives deference to trial court findings on witness credibility, there's always a risk in relying primarily on one witness, especially in cases with no other direct evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A & B:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the victim's credible testimony, the gravity of the offense, and the need to protect children from sexual abuse. The case is significant for reaffirming the importance of witness credibility assessments by the trial court, especially in child abuse cases.
