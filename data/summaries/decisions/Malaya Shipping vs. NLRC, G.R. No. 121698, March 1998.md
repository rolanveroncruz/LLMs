## Legal Document Summary: *Malaya Shipping Services, Inc. vs. NLRC and Rolando M. Rey* (G.R. No. 121698)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari seeking to overturn the NLRC's decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the dismissal of Rolando M. Rey was legal. The core issue is whether sufficient cause existed for dismissal and whether procedural due process was observed.

*   **Factual Background:** Employee (Rey) arrived at work intoxicated, allegedly causing a disturbance and threatening co-workers. Employer (Malaya Shipping) conducted an investigation, suspended Rey, and ultimately terminated him for serious misconduct.

*   **NLRC/Labor Arbiter Decision:** Initially ruled in favor of the employee (Rey), finding illegal dismissal and awarding separation pay, backwages, 13th-month pay, accrued vacation leaves, and attorney's fees. The NLRC affirmed the decision but removed attorney's fees.

*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the NLRC decision. The Supreme Court found that a valid cause for dismissal existed (serious misconduct) based on Rey's behavior while intoxicated, which was not adequately denied. The Supreme Court referenced cases such as *Seahorse Maritime Corporation v. NLRC*, 173 SCRA 390 (1989), which held that drunken and disorderly behavior is a just cause for dismissal. Cases such as *Flores v. NLRC*, 256 SCRA 735 (1996); *Royo v. NLRC*, 256 SCRA 639 (1996); *E.g., Foodmine, Inc. v. NLRC*, 188 SCRA 748 (1990); *Wenphil Corp. v. NLRC*, 170 SCRA 69 (1989); *North Camarines Lumber Co., Inc. v. Barreda*, 153 SCRA 244 (1987); *Haverton Shipping, Ltd. v. NLRC*, 135 SCRA 685 (1985) were also cited which hold that fighting within company premises is a valid ground for dismissal of employee.

*   **Procedural Due Process:** The Court found that while cause existed, the employer failed to fully comply with procedural due process requirements, specifically regarding the initial notice informing the employee of the specific charges against him. Although an investigation occurred, the initial notice of the specific charges for which he was dismissed was lacking. The Court cited *Stolt-Nielsen Marine Services (Phil.), Inc. v. NRLC*, 264 SCRA 307 (1996) regarding the two-notice rule, which consists of a notice to apprise the employee of the specific charges and a notice informing the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him.

*   **Damages:** Because of the procedural lapse, the Supreme Court awarded Rey *nominal damages* of P5,000.00, not as compensation for lost wages but to vindicate his right to procedural due process. The Court relied on *Better Buildings, Inc. v. NLRC*, G.R. No. 109714, December 15, 1997, and Article 2221 of the Civil Code regarding nominal damages.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Employer (Malaya Shipping) is obligated to pay P5,000.00 as nominal damages to the employee.

*   Employer has a general obligation to adhere to procedural due process when dismissing employees.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Serious Misconduct":** The definition of "serious misconduct" is fact-specific, and the Court relies heavily on the employee's failure to explicitly deny the allegations. Future cases could hinge on the specificity of the charges and the employee's response.

*   **Lack of Explicit Statutory Reference for Due Process:** While the Court refers to the two-notice rule, there is no precise citation to a specific section of the Labor Code beyond the general principle of due process. This could lead to challenges in determining what constitutes adequate notice in future cases.

*   **Contentious Clauses:** The validity of the investigation process was questioned due to the transcript of the inquiry.
