**Case Summary: *Raul Domen y Aurellano v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 258893, May 29, 2024)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's approval of the accused's plea bargaining agreement in two drug-related criminal cases.

**Facts:** Raul was charged with illegal sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165) and possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165) of *shabu*. He moved for plea bargaining to Sec. 12 (possession of drug paraphernalia) for both charges. The Prosecution agreed only to the plea bargain for the possession charge, opposing the sale charge plea based on DOJ Circular No. 27 which prohibited plea bargaining for illegal sale to possession of paraphernalia. The RTC granted the motion despite the objection, citing the Court-issued Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases (A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC). The CA reversed, holding that prosecutorial consent was lacking.

**Issue:** Did the RTC gravely abuse its discretion in approving the plea bargain despite the prosecution's objection based on DOJ Circular No. 27?

**Ruling:** No, the Supreme Court (SC) found no grave abuse of discretion.  The petition was granted, reversing the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sec. 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** The original charge in Criminal Case No. 2017-24487. Subject to potential remand for trial.
*   **RA 9165, Sec. 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** Original charge in Criminal Case No. 2017-24488.
*   **RA 9165, Sec. 12 (Possession of Drug Paraphernalia):** The lesser offense to which Raul sought to plead guilty in both cases. Punishment is imprisonment of six months and one day to four years, and a fine ranging from PHP 10,000.00 to PHP 50,000.00.
*   **A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC (Plea Bargaining Framework in Drugs Cases):**  Framework allows plea bargaining for Sec. 5 violations (shabu 0.01-0.99 gram) to Sec. 12.  The basis for the RTC's ruling.
*   **DOJ Circular No. 18 (Revised Amended Guidelines on Plea Bargaining for RA 9165):** Expressly revoked DOJ Circular No. 27, aligning provisions with the Court's Plea Bargaining Framework. This effectively withdraws the prosecution's original objection.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Raul's Potential Liability:**  While the plea bargain for both cases was initially approved by the RTC, the SC remanded both cases to the RTC for further evaluation. Raul faces potential risk of a trial under Sec. 5 of RA 9165 if deemed ineligible for plea bargaining.
*   **Remand Issues:** The RTC must determine:
    *   Strength of the prosecution's evidence;
    *   Whether Raul is a recidivist, habitual offender, drug addict/troublemaker, or has prior relapse/charges.
*   If the plea bargaining proposal is approved by the trial court, a drug dependency assessment shall be conducted to ensure the appropriate treatment and rehabilitation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Montierro (G.R. No. 254564, July 26, 2022):** Guidelines for plea bargaining in drug cases, including assessment of drug dependency and factors for court approval.  Reiterates the Court's exclusive rule-making power on plea bargaining.
*   **Bason v. People (G.R. No. 262664, October 3, 2023):** Drug dependency assessment will be conducted if plea bargaining is approved.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **RTC's Discretion Post-Remand:**  While the SC leans towards upholding the plea bargain based on the framework and the revocation of DOJ Circular No. 27, the ultimate approval still rests on the RTC's discretion after the remanded evaluation.

**Advice:**

Prepare for the remand proceedings. Gather evidence to counter arguments regarding recidivism, prior drug use, or trouble-making.  Argue forcefully that *Montierro* favors upholding the plea bargain and that the prosecution's objection is effectively withdrawn. Prepare client for potential drug dependency assessment.
