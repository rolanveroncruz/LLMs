## Legal Document Summary: Far East Bank & Trust Company v. Gold Palace Jewellery Co.

**Case:** *Far East Bank & Trust Company v. Gold Palace Jewellery Co., G.R. No. 168274, August 20, 2008*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's ruling in favor of FEBTC.

**Facts:** Gold Palace accepted a foreign draft as payment for jewelry. FEBTC, as collecting bank, presented the draft to LBP, the drawee bank. LBP cleared the draft, debiting UOB (issuer's) account and crediting Gold Palace's account with FEBTC. Gold Palace released the jewelry and gave change to the buyer via FEBTC check. Later, LBP discovered the draft was materially altered and demanded reimbursement from FEBTC, who then debited Gold Palace's account.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **NIL Section 62 (Liability of Acceptor):**  The core legal basis. LBP, by paying the draft, engaged to pay it according to the tenor at the time of payment (the altered amount). This effectively bars LBP (and consequently FEBTC) from recovering the payment. Cites *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, 134 Phil. 829 (1968)*
*   **NIL Section 36 (When Indorsement Restrictive):** Gold Palace's indorsement to FEBTC was for collection purposes only (restrictive indorsement). This means title wasn't transferred, and FEBTC cannot invoke warranties of a general indorser under NIL Section 66, because FEBTC did not become a holder in due course.
*   **Principal-Agent Relationship:** FEBTC acted as Gold Palace's agent for collection.  Once LBP paid, and FEBTC collected, the agency ceased, and the transaction closed. FEBTC acted on its own accord when refunding LBP, not as Gold Palace's agent. Cites *Jai-Alai Corporation v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, No. L-29432, August 6, 1975, 66 SCRA 29*.
*   **Holder in Due Course (NIL Section 52):** The Court explicitly found Gold Palace to be a holder in due course, protected under Section 62 of the NIL, as it received the draft complete and regular on its face, before it became overdue and without notice of any dishonor, in good faith and for value, and absent any knowledge of any infirmity.

**Liabilities:**

*   **LBP (Drawee Bank):**  Liable for the payment according to the altered tenor of the draft due to its clearance and payment.  Its recourse is against the party who made the alteration, not Gold Palace or FEBTC.
*   **FEBTC (Collecting Bank):** Liable for wrongfully debiting Gold Palace's account after the transaction had closed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Material Alteration:** The central issue. While the court acknowledges alteration occurred, the decision emphasizes LBP's responsibility in failing to detect it *before* payment.
*   **Common Law & UCC Arguments:** The Court acknowledged the existence of contrary common law principles (money paid by mistake) and the UCC's presentment warranty regarding alteration. However, it explicitly *rejected* their application in this case due to the specific provisions of the NIL and equitable considerations.
*   **Exemplary Damages & Attorney's Fees:**  The CA's award of these was deleted by the Supreme Court. The SC found that FEBTC was not impelled by malice or bad faith in debiting Gold Palace's account or in pursuing its cause.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 2031 (Negotiable Instruments Law)** (NIL), esp. Sections 36, 52, 62, and 66.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, 134 Phil. 829 (1968)**
*   **Jai-Alai Corporation v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, No. L-29432, August 6, 1975, 66 SCRA 29**
*   **Wells Fargo Bank & Union Trust Co. v. Bank of Italy, et al., 214 Cal. 156 (1931)**
*   **Kansas Bankers Surety Company v. Ford County State Bank, 184 Kan. 529 (1959)**

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core dispute revolves around the application of NIL Section 62 in the context of a materially altered negotiable instrument and the subsequent rights and liabilities of the drawee bank, collecting bank, and payee.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modification, deleting the award of exemplary damages and attorney's fees. FEBTC could not debit Gold Palace's account. LBP's remedy is against the party responsible for the alteration.
