## Legal Document Summary: *Esguerra v. Judge Gonzales-Asdala, et al.* (G.R. No. 168906)

**Core Issue:** This is a Petition for Review assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing Perla Esguerra's (Petitioner) Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus against Judge Fatima Gonzales-Asdala (Respondent Judge), J. Walter Thompson Company (JWT), and AGL Market Research, Inc. The core issue is whether the CA erred in dismissing the petition and whether the Respondent Judge can be held liable for damages.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Factual Background:** Petitioner, a nutritionist, appeared in an Ovaltine commercial without prior consent from her employer (Philippine Heart Center) or receipt of the agreed-upon talent fee. She filed suit against JWT and AGL for damages and sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and preliminary injunction.
*   **Procedural Posture:**
    *   The initial RTC Judge (Respondent Judge) denied the TRO/preliminary injunction, leading to the Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus.
    *   The Respondent Judge later inhibited herself from the case.
    *   A new judge granted the TRO and preliminary injunction.
    *   Despite this, the CA dismissed Esguerra's petition, finding it moot and that the Respondent Judge acted within her judicial discretion.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The Respondent Judgeâ€™s failure to swiftly act on her application for a TRO caused her damages due to the continued airing of the commercial. She seeks P2.2 million in damages from the Judge personally.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** The judge acted in good faith, within her jurisdiction and in the exercise of judicial discretion and thus is not liable for damages.

**Key Obligations, Liabilities, & Potential Risks:**

*   **Obligation of Judge to Act Promptly on TRO Applications:** The Petitioner alleges the Respondent Judge violated Section 4(d), Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure by failing to conduct a summary hearing within 24 hours. However, as cited by the Judge, summonses and a verified application for the temporary restraining order were not properly served, which is a clear requirement of Section 4, Rule 58 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **Judicial Immunity:** Judges are generally immune from civil liability for acts performed within their judicial capacity, *provided* they act in good faith. This is a significant hurdle for the petitioner.
*   **Mootness:** The issuance of a TRO and preliminary injunction by the subsequent judge (Padilla) potentially rendered the original petition moot, affecting the viability of the certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus claims.
*   **Double Recovery Risk:** The Petitioner is already pursuing a damages claim against JWT and AGL. Seeking damages from the judge for the same act raises concerns about potential double recovery.
*   **Requirements for Injunctive Relief:** The denial by the initial judge was based on a failure to sufficiently demonstrate the elements required for injunctive relief under Rule 58, Section 3.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Sections 1-3, 5, Rules of Court:** Govern Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus. The decision emphasizes the requirement of demonstrating the absence of other plain, speedy, and adequate remedies, which was allegedly not met.
*   **Rule 58, Sections 3, 4(d) of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders. The 24 hour requirement is not absolute. The court must first ensure that there has been proper and complete service to the opposing party.
*   ***Ang v. Quilala*** **(444 Phil. 742):** Reinforces the principle of judicial immunity and clarifies that judges are not administratively liable for erroneous decisions unless the error is gross, deliberate, malicious, or made in bad faith.
*   ***Contreras v. Judge Solis*** **(329 Phil. 376):** Judges cannot be subject to liability as long as they act in good faith.
*   ***Korea Exchange Bank v. Gonzales*** **(G.R. No. 139460):** Courts will not determine a moot question.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **"Good Faith" Determination:** Establishing the Respondent Judge acted in bad faith is crucial to overcoming judicial immunity. The evidence on this point appears weak based on the summary.
*   **Causation:** Establishing a direct causal link between the Judge's alleged delay and the Petitioner's damages is necessary for the damages claim to succeed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Petitioner faces a high burden of proof to establish bad faith on the part of the Respondent Judge.
*   Judicial immunity strongly protects judges acting within their official capacity.
*   The potential for double recovery weakens the damages claim against the judge.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA ruling denying the petition for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus. There is no ground to hold the public respondent liable for damages because she was acting in good faith, in the exercise of her official function, when she issued the order denying the application for a TRO. The denial was not manifestly unjust nor did it constitute gross ignorance.
