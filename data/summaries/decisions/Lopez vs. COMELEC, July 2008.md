Here's a legal summary of *Lopez v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 182701), focusing on key aspects relevant to a lawyer:

**Case Summary: Lopez v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 182701)**

*   **Facts:** Eusebio Eugenio K. Lopez, a dual citizen (Filipino and American) by re-acquisition under R.A. 9225, ran for Barangay Chairman.  Respondent Villanueva filed a disqualification petition arguing Lopez remained an American citizen. COMELEC disqualified Lopez, which he assailed via Rule 65/64 certiorari.

*   **Issue:**  Whether a dual citizen who re-acquired Filipino citizenship under R.A. 9225 is qualified to run for elective office without executing a personal and sworn renunciation of foreign citizenship.

*   **Holding:**  No. The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's disqualification of Lopez.

*   **Rationale:**

    *   **R.A. 9225, Section 5(2):** Explicitly requires those who re-acquire Filipino citizenship and seek elective office to "make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath" *at the time of filing the Certificate of Candidacy (COC)*.
    *   **Failure to Renounce:** Lopez failed to present evidence of this sworn renunciation. His oath of allegiance when re-acquiring Filipino citizenship was insufficient.
    *   **Distinction from *Valles v. COMELEC*:** The *Valles* case involved dual citizenship by *jus soli* birth, not re-acquisition.  *Valles* was also decided *before* R.A. 9225. *Valles v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 137000, August 9, 2000, 337 SCRA 543.
    *   **Winning Doesn't Cure Defect:**  Popularity cannot override constitutional and statutory disqualifications. *Reyes v. Commission on Elections*, G.R. No. 52699, May 15, 1980, 97 SCRA 500.
    * *Mercado v. Manzano*, G.R. No. 135083, May 26, 1999, 307 SCRA 630, cited in the decision for its discussion of citizenship.

*   **Key Provisions/Obligations:**

    *   R.A. 9225, Section 5(2): Sets the renunciation requirement for dual citizens seeking elective office.
    *   Filing of COC: Renunciation must occur *at the time of filing*.

*   **Liabilities/Risks:**

    *   Disqualification: Failure to comply with the renunciation requirement results in disqualification from running for and holding public office.
    *   Victory is Insufficient: Even winning the election doesn't validate a candidacy if the candidate is disqualified.

*   **Case Law:**

    *   **R.A. No. 9225:** The primary statute governing the re-acquisition of Filipino citizenship and its implications for holding public office.
    *   ***Valles v. COMELEC***: Distinguished, but shows the evolution of jurisprudence on dual citizenship before the enactment of R.A. 9225.
    *   **Reyes v. COMELEC:** Reiterates that the will of the electorate cannot override disqualifications prescribed by law. *Mercado v. Manzano, G.R. No. 135083, May 26, 1999, 307 SCRA 630.*

*   **Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:** None apparent. The requirement of sworn renunciation is clear and unambiguous.

*   **Statutory References:**

    *   Republic Act No. 9225 (Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003)
    *   Rules 64 and 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Petition for Certiorari to the Supreme Court)

**Legal Takeaway:**  This case reinforces the strict requirement of a *personal and sworn* renunciation of foreign citizenship under R.A. 9225 for dual citizens seeking elective office in the Philippines.  A general declaration or oath of allegiance is insufficient.  Counsel should ensure clients seeking to run for office have executed a specific, timely, and properly notarized affidavit of renunciation.
