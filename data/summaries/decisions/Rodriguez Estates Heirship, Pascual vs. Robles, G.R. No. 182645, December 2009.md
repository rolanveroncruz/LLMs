## Legal Document Summary: *Rene B. Pascual vs. Jaime M. Robles*

This is a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision and the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order that effectively voided special proceedings for the settlement of the intestate estates of Hermogenes Rodriguez, Antonio Rodriguez, Macario J. Rodriguez, Delfin Rodriguez, and Consuelo M. Rodriguez.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA had jurisdiction to annul the RTC's Amended Decision despite Jaime Robles' failure to perfect his appeal by not filing a record on appeal as required for special proceedings under **Section 2, Rule 41 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.**

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Initial RTC Decision (1990):** Declared Henry, Certeza, and Rosalina (grandchildren of Antonio) as heirs and appointed Henry as administrator.
*   **Subsequent Oppositions:** Several groups filed oppositions, including Jaime Robles.
*   **RTC Order (1994):** Declared Jaime Robles an heir of Hermogenes and appointed him administrator, allowing him to sell property.
*   **RTC Amended Decision (1999):** Reversed previous finding on one group of heirs, reaffirmed Henry et al. as heirs of Antonio, and dismissed Robles' opposition due to lack of substantiation.
*   **Jaime Robles' Appeal:** Robles filed a *notice of appeal* instead of a *record on appeal*, which is incorrect for special proceedings. The RTC denied the appeal.
*   **CA Decision (2002):** Despite the unperfected appeal, the CA assumed jurisdiction and annulled the RTC's Amended Decision, finding the proceedings void.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Grants the Petition for Certiorari. The Supreme Court holds that the CA *lacked jurisdiction* because Robles failed to perfect his appeal by failing to file a record on appeal. This is because perfecting an appeal is both mandatory and jurisdictional; failing to do so deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction. The Court cites *Rigor v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 167400, 30 June 2006, 494 SCRA 375, 382* and *Testate Estate of Maria Manuel Vda. de Biascan v. Biascan, 401 Phil. 49, 58 (2000)*, in support.

**Obligations:**

*   **Appellants in Special Proceedings:** Obligated to file both a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within 30 days as per Rules of Civil Procedure, Section 2, Rule 41.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Jaime Robles:**  Lost his right to appeal due to non-compliance with the Rules of Procedure. This led to invalidation of his appointment as administrator.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Defective Appeals:** Failure to strictly adhere to procedural rules on appeal (especially record on appeal requirement in special proceedings) will result in loss of appellate rights.
*   **Unjustified Assumption of Jurisdiction:** Appellate courts should be wary of assuming jurisdiction when jurisdictional requirements are not met.
*   **Title Issues:** Depending on actions taken by Robles under the voided order, title to the property sold by Henry Pascual, as administrator, could be contested if claims remain unresolved.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's rationale for assuming jurisdiction despite the defective appeal is not explained in the document, which may warrant further investigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Modes of Appeal
*   *Rigor v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 167400, 30 June 2006, 494 SCRA 375, 382* (on perfection of appeal as jurisdictional)
*   *Testate Estate of Maria Manuel Vda. de Biascan v. Biascan, 401 Phil. 49, 58 (2000)* (appeal periods in special proceedings)

In summary, the Supreme Court's decision underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules, particularly the requirement of perfecting an appeal. The CA overstepped its authority by assuming jurisdiction despite the defective appeal, and therefore its decision was nullified. The original Amended Decision of the RTC, which favored Henry, Certeza, and Rosalina, is reinstated. The status of any transactions undertaken based on the voided administrator appointments should be reviewed.
