**Legal Document Summary: Dawson v. Register of Deeds of Quezon City (G.R. No. 120600)**

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision

**Topic:** Applicability of Section 108 of Presidential Decree (PD) 1529 (Property Registration Decree) for correcting errors in certificates of title where a contract to sell was entered into, but title was erroneously issued to a deceased vendee after heirs completed payments.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Title vests in the vendee only upon full payment of the consideration. (Citing *Salazar v. Court of Appeals*, 258 SCRA 317)
*   **Section 108, PD 1529:** Allows amendment and alteration of certificates of title for omissions, errors, or other reasonable grounds. (Essentially identical to Section 112 of Act 496).
*   **Heirs' Rights:** Heirs who assume the obligations of a deceased vendee in a contract to sell and complete payment are entitled to ownership of the property.
*   **Juridical Capacity:** Deceased individuals lack juridical capacity to acquire title. (Citing Art. 37 and 42 of the Civil Code).

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners (heirs) must fulfill the requirements of Section 108 of PD 1529 to effect the title correction.

**Liabilities:**

*   No specific liabilities outlined in the text. However, the Court of Appeals raised concerns about potential tax evasion, requiring closer scrutiny of tax compliance.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Tax Implications:** The delay in filing the petition could raise concerns about unpaid capital gains tax or other taxes.
*   **Fulfillment of Sec 108 Requirements**: Petitioners bear the burden of providing evidence of tax compliance and meeting all requirements stated in section 108 of PD 1529

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 108:** Property Registration Decree.
*   **Act 496, Section 112:** Public Land Act (predecessor to PD 1529, Sec 108), cited in *Cruz v. Tan*, 93 Phil. 348.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 37 & 42:** Relates to Juridical capacity of an individual.
*   ***Salazar v. Court of Appeals*, 258 SCRA 317:** Defines the difference between a contract to sell and a contract of sale.
*   ***Cruz v. Tan*, 93 Phil. 348:** Similar case allowed application of Section 112 of Public Land Act (identical to PD 1529 Section 108)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lower courts questioned the timing of the petition, implying a possible motive to evade taxes. Although speculation is not enough to prevent the cancellation, it calls attention to potential issues.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court ruled that the heirs of Louis P. Dawson could use the summary proceedings under Section 108 of PD 1529 to correct an erroneous title issued to their deceased father. Since the heirs completed payments under the contract to sell, the title should have been issued to them. The Court emphasized that the property was not part of the deceased's estate because ownership only vested upon full payment, which occurred after his death. The Court stated that the issue is not really novel, citing *Cruz v. Tan*. It directed the RTC to cancel the title and issue a new one to the heirs, subject to them fulfilling the requirements under Section 108.
