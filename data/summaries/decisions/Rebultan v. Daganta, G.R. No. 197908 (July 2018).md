## Legal Document Summary: Rebultan v. Daganta, G.R. No. 197908 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a vehicular accident and subsequent damages claim.

**Key Issue:** Determination of negligence in a vehicular collision, specifically the right of way at an intersection.

**Facts:** A Kia Ceres driven by Lomotos (with Rebultan, Sr. as passenger) collided with an Isuzu jeepney driven by Viloria, owned by Spouses Daganta. Rebultan, Sr. died. The RTC found Viloria negligent, holding him and the Spouses Daganta (vicariously liable) solidarily liable for damages. The CA reversed, finding Lomotos negligent and dismissing the complaint.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, finding *both* drivers negligent. The SC reinstated the RTC decision, *excluding* Lomotos because the dismissal of the third-party complaint against him was not appealed.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Negligence (Art. 2176, Civil Code):** Both Viloria and Lomotos were negligent in their operation of their vehicles, leading to joint and several liability.
*   **Right of Way (Sec. 42, R.A. No. 4136 - Land Transportation and Traffic Code):** The CA misinterpreted the right-of-way rules. The SC clarified that the driver turning left (Viloria) had a duty to yield to the vehicle approaching from the opposite direction (Lomotos), who initially had right-of-way. However, both drivers exceeded the speed limit.
*   **Vicarious Liability (Art. 2180, Civil Code):** The Spouses Daganta, as employers/owners of the jeepney, are vicariously liable for Viloria's negligence *but only if Viloria himself is held negligent.*
*   **Joint Tortfeasors:** Because of the concurrent negligence, Viloria and Lomotos were considered joint tortfeasors and solidarily liable to the heirs of Rebultan, Sr.
*   **Contributory Negligence:** The driver's (Lomotos) negligence cannot be imputed to the passenger (Rebultan, Sr.) unless the passenger exercised control over the vehicle's operation. This is based on the principle established in *Junio v. Manila Railroad Co.*
*   **Damages:** The RTC awarded actual damages, moral damages, loss of earning capacity, and attorney's fees. These awards were reinstated against Viloria and Spouses Daganta.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 2176, 2180, 2185 (presumption of negligence for violating traffic rules)
*   **R.A. No. 4136:** Sections 42 (Right of Way), 48 (Reckless Driving)

**Case Law:**

*   ***Caminos, Jr. v. People***: The CA misinterpreted this case regarding right of way at intersections. The SC clarified the proper application of this precedent.
*   ***Junio v. Manila Railroad Co.***:  Established the principle that a driver's negligence is not imputed to passengers without control.
*   ***Dy Teban Trading, Inc. v. Ching***: Joint Tortfeasors and Several Liability

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Third-Party Complaint Dismissal:** The failure to appeal the dismissal of the third-party complaint against Lomotos, as well as Lomotos not being made party to the SC case, limited the court's ability to impose liability directly on him.
*   **Factual Determination:** Negligence is a factual issue. The SC reviewed the case because the CA made a manifestly mistaken inference from the facts.
*   **Burden of Proof:** There is always the risk of failing to prove negligence or causation in similar cases.

**Conclusion:** This case emphasizes the importance of adhering to traffic regulations, even when one has a perceived right of way. It also clarifies the principle that a driver's negligence is not automatically imputed to a passenger who has no control over the vehicle's operation. Spouses Daganta, although technically vicariously liable, only incurred such liability due to the actions of Viloria.
