## Legal Document Summary: Dawa vs. De Asa, Buencamino vs. De Asa (A.M. No. MTJ-98-1144, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1148)

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases against Judge Armando C. de Asa, Metropolitan Trial Court, Caloocan City, for "sexual harassment and/or acts of lasciviousness" (R.A. 7877) and grave misconduct.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Allegations:** Judge de Asa is accused of multiple instances of unwanted kissing, touching, and suggestive comments against court employees (Floride Dawa, Noraliz L. Jorgensen, Feminina Lazaro-Barreto) and the Clerk of Court (Mona Lisa A. Buencamino).
*   **Evidence:** Testimonies of the complainants and corroborating witnesses (Judge Santiago, Maria Teresa Carpio, Cielito M. Mapue, David Maniquiz, Ma. Victoria Soriano-Cruz).
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Vehement denial of the allegations; claims of conspiracy instigated by Atty. Buencamino due to his strict enforcement of court rules and a proposed office relocation plan. Also, the respondent tried to assail the credibility of one of the complainants.
*   **Investigating Officer's Findings:**  Investigating Justice Romulo S. Quimbo found sufficient evidence to establish with moral certainty that Judge De Asa committed the alleged acts. He discredited the respondent's defenses and the testimonies of his witnesses.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court adopted the Investigating Justice's findings. The Court found Judge De Asa guilty of gross misconduct and immorality, violating the Code of Judicial Conduct and Canons of Judicial Ethics.  His actions created a hostile work environment in violation of R.A. 7877.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges must uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary (Canon 1).
*   Judges must avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities (Canon 2).
*   Judges must maintain high standards of morality and decency.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent Judge Armando C. de Asa was dismissed from service.
*   Forfeiture of all retirement benefits and leave credits.
*   Preclusion from re-employment in any government branch or government-owned/controlled corporation.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The case hinges heavily on the credibility of the complaining witnesses versus the respondent and his witnesses. The court clearly sided with the complaints stating, "Respondentâ€™s denials cannot overcome the probative value of the positive assertions of complainants and their witnesses."
*   **Motive of Conspiracy:** Respondent claims Atty. Buencamino instigated the charges out of personal resentment. However, the Court found the reasons for the alleged resentment to be too superficial to genuinely cause such malevolence and the complaints were not motivated by this ill will.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995):** Defines sexual harassment and its illegality.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct:** Mandates ethical behavior for judges.
*   **Canons of Judicial Ethics:** Further elaborates on the expected moral and ethical standards for judges.
*   **Talens-Dabon vs. Arceo, 259 SCRA 354 (1996):** Similar case involving a judge abusing his authority to commit acts of lasciviousness.
*   **Junio vs. Rivera, Jr., 225 SCRA 688 (1993):** Case relating to the standards of conduct expected of judges.

**Conclusion:** The document outlines a clear case of judicial misconduct based on credible evidence of sexual harassment. The decision emphasizes the high ethical standards expected of judges and serves as a precedent for holding judicial officers accountable for such behavior.
