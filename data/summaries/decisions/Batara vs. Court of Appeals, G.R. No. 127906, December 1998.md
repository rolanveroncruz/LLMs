**Case Summary: Batara v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127906, December 16, 1998**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's disapproval of Petitioners' Notice of Appeal.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Obsequio assigned land to Violeta Batara via a Deed of Assignment (unregistered) in 1985, stipulating a down payment and monthly installments.
*   Clause 10 of the contract provided that the assignor could re-assign the land if the assignee fails to pay 3 months, in which case payments made will be considered rentals and liquidated damages.
*   Batara made the down payment and some irregular payments until September 1990, stopping after learning of a mortgage.
*   Obsequio mortgaged the land to Spouses Punongbayan in 1990, then sold it to them in 1991.  The sale was registered under TCT No. T-5448.
*   Punongbayans filed Civil Case No. 129-0-92 for recovery of possession.
*   Batara filed Civil Case No. 256-0-92 for quieting of title and annulment of TCT No. T-5448. The cases were consolidated.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Punongbayans, upholding the sale and ordering Batara to pay attorney's fees.
*   Batara's Motion for Reconsideration was denied. Batara filed a Notice of Appeal, which was denied for being filed out of time.
*   CA affirmed the RTC's disapproval of the Notice of Appeal, citing the appeal was late, a petition for certiorari could not substitute for a lost appeal, and certiorari is only for errors of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Assignment:** Establishes the agreement between Obsequio and Batara for the sale of land, including payment terms and default clause (Clause 10).
*   **Clause 10:** Defines the consequences of default, specifically the right of the assignor to re-assign the land and retain payments as rentals/liquidated damages.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** Governed by procedural rules requiring perfection of appeal within 15 days.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Batara:**  Loss of the land due to failure to timely appeal the RTC decision upholding the sale to Punongbayans.  Potential liability for attorney's fees and costs awarded by the RTC. Risk of failing to enforce the Deed of Assignment due to lack of registration and default in payments. Clause 10 puts assignee at risk of losing payments made.
*   **Obsequio:** Potential liability for breach of contract if the assignment to Batara was valid and enforceable, and the sale to Punongbayan violated Batara's rights.
*   **Punongbayan:** Minimal risk, as the RTC decision in their favor was upheld.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 13, Civil Code:** Used in computing the period for filing an appeal (excluding the first day, including the last).
*   **Rules of Court:** Governs the timeliness of appeals and the grounds for certiorari.
*   **Siguenza v. Court of Appeals:** Cites the case which allowed a late appeal because it appeared meritorious.
*   **Philippine National Bank (PNB) v. Court of Appeals:** Cites the case that allowed a late appeal in the higher interest of justice.
*   **De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan:** Cites the case where procedural rules were relaxed to give way to substantial justice.
*   **Sanchez v. Court of Appeals:** Cites the case enumerating exceptions where certiorari is not a substitute for lost appeal.
*   **Almeda v. Court of Appeals:** Cites the ruling that perfection of an appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.
*   **Lloren v. De Veyra:** Cites the case detailing how to compute periods of time.
*   **Municipality of Obando, Bulacan v. Intermediate Appellate Court:** Cites the ruling that delay due to negligence of the counsel does not justify a late filing of an appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Clause 10 of the Deed of Assignment:** The language regarding "rentals" and "liquidated damages" could be contentious if Batara argues that the payments made significantly exceeded a fair rental value or that the liquidated damages were unreasonable.  The lack of clarity on how the "re-assignment" would occur also presents ambiguity.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   **Batara:** Argued that the delay in filing the Notice of Appeal was due to a misinterpretation of the rules regarding the period to appeal after a motion for reconsideration. However, the Court rejected this argument, citing counsel's negligence.
*   **The Court:** The Court calculated the period to appeal from the time of receipt of decision and denial of the Motion for Reconsideration. The Court also dismissed the claim that the discussion on the merits was required.
*   **The Court:** Ruled that perfection of an appeal is not only mandatory but jurisdictional. The Court ruled that the argument that the delay to file an appeal was due to a misinterpretation of rules by Batara's council was inadequate to justify a late appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding that the Notice of Appeal was filed out of time due to counsel's negligence. The Court rejected arguments that procedural rules should be relaxed in the interest of substantial justice, emphasizing the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the appeal period. The final and executory judgement of the trial court resulting from the petitioners' failure to seasonably file an appeal can no longer be disturbed by the petition.
