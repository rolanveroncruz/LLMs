Here's a legal summary of *Cebu Winland Development Corporation v. Ong Siao Hua*, G.R. No. 173215, May 21, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

This case concerns a dispute over a condominium unit sale where the actual area of the units was significantly less than advertised.  The central issues are (1) prescription of the buyer's (Ong Siao Hua) action for a refund and (2) whether the sale was *ad mensuram* (by unit of measure) or *ad corpus* (lump sum).

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Parties:** Cebu Winland Development Corporation (Petitioner/Developer); Ong Siao Hua (Respondent/Buyer).
*   **Subject Matter:** Sale of two condominium units and parking slots.
*   **Discrepancy in Area:**  Advertised area was 155 sq. m. per unit, later reduced to 127 sq. m. in the deeds of sale, and ultimately verified at 110 sq. m.
*   **Payment:**  Buyer made a down payment and paid the balance in installments based on the advertised area and price per square meter.
*   **Timeline:**
    *   Offer and acceptance of the offer of petitioner: January 6, 1995
    *   Delivery of possession: October 10, 1996
    *   Complaint filed before HLURB: August 7, 1998

**Legal Issues and Analysis:**

1.  **Prescription (Article 1543, Civil Code):**
    *   *Issue:* Did the buyer's action for a refund prescribe under Article 1543, which provides a six-month prescriptive period from the "day of delivery" for actions arising from Articles 1539 and 1542 of the Civil Code?
    *   *Ruling:* The Supreme Court held that the "delivery" contemplated under Article 1543 requires both the transfer of possession AND ownership.  Since the deeds of absolute sale were not executed until *after* full payment, ownership hadn't transferred at the time of possession. Therefore, the prescriptive period did not begin to run from the date of physical possession. This is a key point of contention and the basis for the Court's decision.  *Equatorial Realty Development, Inc. v. Mayfair Theater, Inc.*, 370 SCRA 56 (2001) defines delivery as the absolute giving up of control and custody of the property.

2.  **Type of Sale (Articles 1539 and 1542, Civil Code):**
    *   *Issue:* Was the sale *ad mensuram* (based on price per unit of measure) or *ad corpus* (lump sum)?
    *   *Ruling:* The Court determined the sale was *ad mensuram*. The price was calculated based on a price list stating a specific price per square meter (P22,378.95/sq. m.). The SC cited *Rudolf Lietz, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 478 SCRA 451 (2005) in applying Article 1539. Thus, the buyer was entitled to a proportional reduction of the price.

3.  **Mistake Invalidating Consent (Articles 1330 and 1331, Civil Code):**
    *   *Issue:* Did the mistake in the area constitute a ground for rescission based on Articles 1330 and 1331?
    *   *Ruling:* The Court held that Articles 1330 and 1331 are inapplicable.  The mistake was not material enough to vitiate the consent.  The buyer continued to occupy the units and sought a refund, demonstrating they would have entered into the contract despite the smaller area.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Cebu Winland Development Corporation:** Obligated to refund Ong Siao Hua P2,014,105.50, representing the overpayment due to the discrepancy in area, plus legal interest.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Formal Contract:** The absence of a written contract detailing the terms of the sale (specifically regarding area and price calculation) contributed to the dispute.  This highlights the risk of relying solely on promotional materials and price lists.
*   **Interpretation of "Delivery":** The Court's interpretation of "delivery" under Article 1543 is crucial.  It establishes that mere physical possession is insufficient to trigger the prescriptive period if ownership is withheld.
*   **HLURB's jurisdiction:** The Court's ruling implies HLURB's jurisdiction, which is significant, since it involves real estate disputes.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *affirmed* the Court of Appeals' decision but *modified* it.  The HLURB decision granting rescission was not reinstated. Cebu Winland was ordered to refund Ong Siao Hua P2,014,105.50 with interest.

**Recommendations for a Lawyer:**

*   **Carefully draft sales contracts:** Clearly specify the basis for the purchase price (unit price vs. lump sum) and the exact area being conveyed.
*   **Clearly define the point of "delivery":** Specify the exact conditions that must be met before "delivery" is considered complete for purposes of calculating prescriptive periods.
*   **Understand relevant jurisprudence:** Be aware of *Equatorial Realty* and *Rudolf Lietz* to argue whether the transfer of ownership is material for prescription.
*   **Consider Article 1539 relief:** If representing a buyer with area discrepancies, argue for proportional reduction of the price rather than rescission if rescission is not desired.
