Here's a concise legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Union Bank of the Philippines v. Pacific Equipment Corporation, et al.*, G.R. No. 172053, October 6, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA Decision regarding a Writ of Execution.

**Background:** Union Bank (Petitioner) filed a replevin/sum of money case against Pacific Equipment (Respondent) in 1986, obtaining a Writ of Attachment on respondent's properties.  Petitioner sold the properties without court authorization. The attachment was later lifted upon Respondent's posting of a counterbond. The Court of Appeals (CA) ultimately ordered Union Bank to return the proceeds of the unauthorized sale (P3,850,000.00) plus interest.  A Writ of Execution was issued, prompting Union Bank to contest its validity, particularly the inclusion of interest. This case stems from the resulting CA decision on the issue of whether the writ of execution conforms with the decision sought to be implemented.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether the Writ of Execution (WOE) conformed to the final and executory CA Decision, specifically regarding interest.
*   **CA Decision (Affirmed by SC):** Upheld the validity of the WOE with a *modification* on the *interest rate*.
    *   Interest of *6% per annum* is applicable from the date of sale of the attached properties until the day before the finality of the decision to be executed (April 3, 2002).
    *   Interest of *12% per annum* is applicable from April 3, 2002, until full payment.
*   **Rationale:** The Supreme Court (SC) clarified an *ambiguity* in the CA decision's *fallo* (dispositive portion) regarding the inclusion of "interests" in the amount to be paid. The SC construed that the CA intended to award interests *in addition to* the P3,850,000.00 representing the proceeds of the sale.
*   The CA and SC both held that failure of respondent corporation to operate since 1981 was not a supervening event and no action has been specifically instituted against it.

**Obligations:**

*   Union Bank is obligated to pay Pacific Equipment P3,850,000.00, *plus* interest, calculated as detailed above, to the other parties.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   Union Bank's continued delay in complying with the final judgment will accrue more interest charges.

**Risks:**

*   Union Bank faces enforcement actions (e.g., garnishment) if it fails to satisfy the judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule on Immutability of Final Judgments:** Emphasized; final judgments are generally unalterable. Exceptions include correction of clerical errors, *nunc pro tunc* entries, void judgments, and supervening events making execution unjust. *See Lee v. Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Br. 85, G.R. No. 146006, April 22, 2005, 456 SCRA 538, 553-554; Mayon Estate Corporation v. Altura, G.R. No. 134462, October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 377, 386; Sacdalan v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128967, May 20, 2004, 428 SCRA 586, 599.*
*   **Interpretation of Judgments:**  Fallo controls over the body of the decision, *only* when the dispositive part of a final decision or order is definite, clear and unequivocal, and can wholly be given effect without need of interpretation or construction. *See Obra v. Badua, G.R. No. 149125, August 9, 2007, 529 SCRA 621, 626.*
*   **Interest Rates:**  Implied reference to prevailing jurisprudence on legal interest rates applicable to judgments (6% *per annum* for obligations not involving loans or forbearance of money before the effectivity of the decision to be executed).
* **Supervening events**: The court cited *Jose Clavano, Inc. v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, 428 Phil. 208, 228 (2002)* to define the criteria for supervening events.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention was the interpretation of the original CA decision's *fallo*, specifically whether the P3,850,000.00 included interest or was *in addition to* interest. The SC resolved this ambiguity by resorting to the intent of the CA.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA's decision, clarifying that Union Bank must pay Pacific Equipment P3,850,000.00 plus interest at the specified rates.  Union Bank's arguments against the WOE were rejected.
