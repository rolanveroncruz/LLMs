## Legal Document Summary: People v. Dela Rosa, G.R. No. 238338 (2018)

This Supreme Court decision reverses the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the RTC's conviction of Edgardo Dela Rosa, Criselda Huerto, and Ronaldo Huerto for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Court *acquits* the accused-appellants based on a *failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody* of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation of Secs. 5 & 11, Art. II, RA 9165:** Charges stem from a buy-bust operation.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, RA 9165):** The prosecution failed to present evidence showing compliance with Section 21 requirements, specifically regarding the presence of required witnesses during the inventory and photography of the seized items.
*   **Required Witnesses:** Absence of *both* a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ) *and* the media during inventory and photography, as required by the pre-RA 10640 version of Sec. 21, is fatal to the prosecution's case.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution offered *no* explanation for the absence of the required witnesses, failing to meet the exception to strict compliance with Sec. 21.
*   **Integrity of Corpus Delicti:** Due to the procedural lapses, the Court finds that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been compromised, raising doubt as to the *corpus delicti*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The State bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the chain of custody was properly maintained. As reiterated in *People v. Miranda*, failure to account for any lapses risks reversal of the conviction.
*   **Police Obligations:** Apprehending officers have a positive duty to secure the presence of the required witnesses during the inventory and photography. Mere unavailability is insufficient; genuine efforts to contact them are required.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of Sec. 21 Amendments:** The case arose before RA 10640 amended Sec. 21, necessitating compliance with the stricter pre-amendment requirements for witnesses (DOJ *and* media).
*   **Presumption vs. Proof of Justifiable Grounds:** The Court emphasizes that justifiable grounds for non-compliance cannot be presumed; they must be proven as a fact.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Secs. 5 & 11:** Defines the crimes of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Sec. 21 (pre- and post-RA 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including inventory, photography, and the presence of required witnesses.
*   **RA 10640:** Amended Sec. 21 of RA 9165, changing the witness requirements.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671 (2018):** Reinforces the State's positive duty to account for chain of custody lapses.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):** Established the standards for justifying non-compliance with Sec. 21.

**Conclusion:**

The Court finds that the prosecution failed to adequately establish the chain of custody, particularly concerning the presence of required witnesses during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs.  The lack of justification for these lapses compromised the integrity of the *corpus delicti*, necessitating the acquittal of the accused-appellants. This decision underscores the importance of strict compliance with the procedural safeguards outlined in RA 9165 and the prosecution's burden to justify any deviations.
