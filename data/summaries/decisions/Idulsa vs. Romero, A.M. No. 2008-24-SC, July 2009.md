## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 2008-24-SC

**Case:** Re: Fighting Incident Between Two SC Shuttle Bus Drivers, Messrs. Edilberto L. Idulsa and Ross C. Romero.

**Court:** Supreme Court (En Banc)

**Date:** July 14, 2009

**Summary:**

This administrative case concerns a physical altercation between two Supreme Court shuttle bus drivers, Edilberto Idulsa and Ross Romero. The incident stemmed from a parking dispute the previous day. The Court found both drivers guilty of **Simple Misconduct**, a less grave offense under the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (CSC Resolution No. 991936).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Incident:** A fistfight occurred on November 19, 2008, between Idulsa and Romero at Paco Park. Witnesses and security personnel investigated.
*   **Conflicting Accounts:** Idulsa and Romero provided differing accounts of the events leading up to the fight. Idulsa claimed he approached Romero to discuss the parking incident, while Romero claimed Idulsa confronted him aggressively.
*   **Credibility:** The Court gave more weight to Romero's version of events. It found Idulsa to be the aggressor, initiating the confrontation that led to the fight. The report also discards the use of a brass knuckle as there was no valid evidence to support its use.
*   **Misconduct:** Engaging in a fistfight, despite the provocation, is deemed unacceptable behavior for court employees and constitutes simple misconduct. *Nacionales v. Madlangbayan, A.M. No. P-06-2171 (2006).* *De la Cruz v. Zapico, A.M. No. 2007-25-SC (2008).*
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Idulsa (Aggressor):** Suspended for One (1) Month and One (1) Day without pay.
    *   **Romero:** Suspended for Fifteen (15) Days without pay.
    *   Both were warned that future similar offenses would result in more severe penalties.

**Obligations:**

*   Both Idulsa and Romero are obligated to refrain from engaging in similar misconduct in the future. As court employees, they are expected to conduct themselves with prudence, restraint, courtesy, and dignity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Both employees are liable for their conduct unbecoming a court employee. *Court Personnel of the Office of the Clerk of Court of Regional Trial Court-San Carlos City v. Llamas, 488 Phil. 62 (2004).*
*   Further acts of misconduct will result in harsher disciplinary action, potentially including dismissal (Section 52 (B)(2), CSC Resolution No. 991936).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The determination of who threw the first punch, and the exact nature of the interaction leading up to the fight remains somewhat ambiguous.
*   **Future Conduct:** Any repetition of similar behavior by either party could lead to more severe penalties, including dismissal.
*   **Precedent:** This case sets a precedent for disciplining court employees for off-duty conduct that reflects negatively on the judiciary.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (CSC Resolution No. 991936):** Defines simple misconduct as a less grave offense (Section 52 (B)(2)) and outlines penalties, including suspension. Section 53 allows for mitigating and aggravating circumstances in penalty determination.

**Case Law:**

*   **De la Cruz v. Zapico, A.M. No. 2007-25-SC, September 18, 2008:** Establishes the standard of conduct expected of judiciary employees.
*   **Court Personnel of the Office of the Clerk of Court of Regional Trial Court-San Carlos City v. Llamas, 488 Phil. 62, 70-71 (2004):** Reinforces the obligation of court employees to accord respect to others.
*   **Nacionales v. Madlangbayan, A.M. No. P-06-2171, June 15, 2006:** Highlights the negative impact of misbehavior on the image of the judiciary.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of who initiated the physical altercation could be viewed as somewhat contentious given the conflicting testimonies. The Court's reliance on Romero's version, while justified, is based on an assessment of credibility.
*   The lack of corroborating evidence regarding the brass knuckle.
