**Case:** *Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) vs. Marian T. Vicencio*, G.R. No. 176832, May 21, 2009 (606 Phil. 120)

**Summary:**

This case involves a claim for death benefits under Presidential Decree No. 626 (P.D. No. 626), as amended (Employees' Compensation Act), filed by Marian T. Vicencio, the widow of Judge Honorato S. Vicencio, against the GSIS. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ordering the GSIS to grant the claim.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Compensability Standard:** The Court reiterated the two-pronged test for compensability under P.D. No. 626: (1) the illness is a listed occupational disease *or* (2) if not listed, the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions.

*   **Cause of Death:** The Court considered the cause of death listed in the Death Certificate, Cardiopulmonary Arrest T/C Fatal Arrythmia.

*   **Cardiovascular Disease:** The Court sided with the widow, and considered Cardiopulmonary Arrest T/C Fatal Arrythmia as cardiovascular disease, a listed disease under Annex "A" of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation. The Court noted evidence supported the stress from Judge Vicencio's work contributed.

*   **Lung Cancer:** The Court alternatively ruled that, *even if* lung cancer was the primary cause, the claim was still compensable. Despite lung cancer being listed as an occupational disease only for vinyl chloride and plastic workers, the Court found substantial evidence (dusty records, poor ventilation in the Manila City Hall workplace) that Judge Vicencio's working conditions increased the risk or aggravated the condition.  Cited *Dator v. Employees' Compensation Commission* (197 Phil. 590 (1982)) regarding librarians and dusty conditions in the library.

*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The Court emphasized that P.D. No. 626 requires only "substantial evidence" to establish a work connection, not a direct causal relationship. Probability, not certainty, is the touchstone. Cites *Salalima v. Employees' Compensation Commission*, G.R. No. 146360, May 20, 2004, 428 SCRA 715, 722-723

*   **Liberal Interpretation:** The Court invoked the principle of liberal interpretation in favor of labor, citing Article 4 of the New Labor Code, especially where there is a factual basis for inferring a work-connection to the illness. Cites *Buena Obra v. Social Security System*, G.R. No. 147745, April 9, 2003, 401 SCRA 206, 216.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **GSIS:** Obligated to grant the death benefits claim to Marian T. Vicencio.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Medical Causation:** The ambiguity in the Death Certificate and the differing medical opinions regarding the primary cause of death (Cardiopulmonary Arrest vs. Adenocarcinoma of the Lungs) were potential points of contention. The GSIS's argument that Cardiopulmonary Arrest was merely a complication was overcome by the Court's liberal interpretation.

*   **Work Connection to Lung Cancer:** The link between the working conditions (dusty environment, stress) and the development or aggravation of lung cancer could be challenged due to the lack of a direct causal link and the absence of a medical opinion explicitly stating this connection. The Court's reliance on *Dator* might be questioned for its factual distinctions.
