## Legal Document Summary - SEC vs. PASBDI et al. (G.R. Nos. 198425, 201174, 244462)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions challenging the RTC's jurisdiction and grant of preliminary injunctions against the SEC and PSE regarding voting rights limitations for broker-shareholders in the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE).

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **Section 33.2(c) of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC, RA 8799):** Limits beneficial ownership and control of voting rights in a stock exchange to 5% for individuals and 20% for industry/business groups. Grants SEC the power to exempt applicants if ownership/control doesn't negatively impact the exchange's operation in the public interest.
*   **SEC Resolution No. 86 (Series of 2010) & Subsequent Orders:** Applied the 20% voting limitation to brokers as an industry group within the PSE.
*   **PASBDI's Injunction Petitions:** Filed with the RTC challenging the SEC's directives and the PSE's implementation, arguing infringement of property rights.

**Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Does the RTC have jurisdiction over the injunction petitions challenging the SEC's actions related to Section 33.2(c)?
2.  **Propriety of Injunction:** Did the RTC err in granting preliminary injunctions against the SEC and PSE?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the RTC *did* have jurisdiction because the petition challenged the SEC's quasi-legislative function (issuance of rules and regulations). However, the SC found that the RTC erred in issuing the injunction *against the SEC* as it was merely enforcing a valid provision of the SRC, but injunctions against the Philippine Stock Exchange stand, only with regard to 2010 rules.

**Rationale:**

*   **RTC Jurisdiction:** Citing *British American Tobacco v. Camacho* (584 Phil. 489 (2008)) and *Smart Communications, Inc. v. NTC* (456 Phil. 145 (2003)), the SC reiterated that regular courts have jurisdiction to determine the validity or constitutionality of rules and regulations issued by administrative agencies in their quasi-legislative capacity. The PASBDI's petition challenged the SEC's directive to the PSE, which was a quasi-legislative act.
*   **Impropriety of Injunction (SEC):** The SEC was merely implementing Section 33.2(c), which enjoys a presumption of validity.  A collateral attack on the statute (through an injunction to prevent its implementation) is impermissible, citing *Vivas v. The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas* (716 Phil. 132 (2013)). The right to vote the share is subject to reasonable conditions that come with the share itself.
*   **Propriety of Injunction (PSE):** The court noted that PSE Rule for 2010 incorrectly stated that limitations should be based on 20% of shareholders shareholding, rather than as a group.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **SEC:** Obligated to administer and enforce the SRC, including Section 33.2(c). Can grant exemptions from the 20% rule but must do so reasonably.
*   **PSE:** Must comply with the SRC and SEC directives. Limited in its capacity to adopt rules inconsistent with limitations.
*   **PASBDI & Member Brokers:** Must comply with the 20% industry ownership limit unless granted an exemption by the SEC. Liable to administrative sanctions for non-compliance, now with new directives.
*   **Shareholder:** Must directly challenge validity to receive exemption.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **SEC Exemption Process:**  The criteria for granting exemptions under Section 33.2(c) remain somewhat ambiguous.  The SEC's discretion is broad, creating potential for arbitrary application.
*   **"Industry Group" Definition:** The definition of "industry group" could be challenged, particularly regarding the aggregation of brokers. It is unlikely to sway.
*   **Collateral Attack Doctrine:** PASBDI et al. indirectly challenged the validity of Section 33.2(c). Any future challenges by PASBDI et al. must directly attack the validity of Section 33.2(c).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code)**, specifically Section 4, 5, 33.2(c), and 72.1.
*   **Revised Corporation Code Section 23**
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court**
*   **Rule 58, Section 3 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure**
*   **British American Tobacco v. Camacho, 584 Phil. 489 (2008)**
*   **Smart Communications, Inc. v. NTC, 456 Phil. 145 (2003)**
*   **De Guzman-Fuerte v. Sps. Estomo, 830 Phil. 653 (2018)**
*   **Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines v. Sec. Mendoza, 879 Phil. 574 (2020)**
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, 248 Phil. 762 (1988)**

**Conclusion:**

The SC clarified the jurisdictional boundaries between the RTC and the SEC regarding challenges to quasi-legislative vs. quasi-judicial acts. It upheld the validity of Section 33.2(c) and cautioned against collateral attacks on statutes. The decision provides guidance on voting rights limitations in stock exchanges and the SEC's enforcement powers but leaves some ambiguity regarding the exemption process and industry group definitions.
