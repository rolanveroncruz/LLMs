Here's a concise legal summary of the *Eastern Assurance and Surety Corporation v. Con-Field Construction and Development Corporation* case:

**Case Overview:** Eastern Assurance and Surety Corporation (EASCO) is appealing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) ruling holding EASCO solidarily liable with Freezinhot for a performance bond of P346,150.00, plus interest. Con-Field (respondent) contracted with Freezinhot to install an air-conditioning system for ABS-CBN. EASCO issued a performance bond to guarantee Freezinhot's performance. Freezinhot failed to complete the project, leading to its termination and Con-Field incurring additional costs to complete the project itself. Con-Field then sued Freezinhot and EASCO to recover these costs, and the performance bond.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Agreement:** The agreement between Con-Field and Freezinhot stipulated that Freezinhot would provide labor, equipment, and materials for the air-conditioning installation, with a performance bond of P346,150.00.
*   **Performance Bond:** EASCO, as surety, guaranteed Freezinhot's performance up to the amount of the bond (P346,150.00).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Freezinhot:** Primarily liable for breach of contract for failing to complete the project, leading to Con-Field incurring additional expenses of P616,961.14. Liable to reimburse EASCO for any payments made under the performance bond, plus interest, per the indemnity agreement.
*   **EASCO:** Solidarily liable with Freezinhot for the performance bond amount of P346,150.00 due to Freezinhot's failure to perform.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Freezinhot and EASCO are jointly and severally liable for P20,000.00 in attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **EASCO's argument of a 'Labor-Only' Arrangement:** EASCO argued that the arrangement between Con-Field and Freezinhot constituted prohibited 'labor-only' contracting under the Labor Code. EASCO claims that due to Freezeinhot's lack of investment, the contract was never implemented. This argument was deemed waived as it was raised for the first time on appeal. *See Spouses Delfino v. St. James Hospital, Inc., G.R. No. 166735, November 23, 2007*
*   **Termination:** EASCO argued that the parties mutually terminated the contract, extinguishing Freezinhot's primary obligation and, consequently, EASCO's surety obligation under Article 2076 of the Civil Code. The court rejected this argument, stating that Con-Field's acceptance of Freezinhot's termination was due to Freezinhot's default and did not constitute a waiver of Con-Field's right to seek damages and enforce the bond under the Article VI (FAILURE TO COMPLETE; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES; RIGHT TO TAKE OVER) of the Agreement.
*   **Extent of Freezinhot's Completion:** EASCO contended that Freezinhot completed a substantial portion of the work (allegedly 78%), therefore reducing their liability on the bond. The court deemed this unsubstantiated and affirmed full liability for the bond amount, particularly given Con-Field's incurred damages exceeding the bond amount.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 2052, 2063, 2076:** Referenced regarding the nature of guaranty, compromise, and the extinguishment of guarantor obligations.

*   *Spouses Delfino v. St. James Hospital, Inc., G.R. No. 166735, November 23, 2007*: Regarding the rule that issues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied EASCO's petition, affirming the CA's decision. EASCO remained liable for the full amount of the performance bond because Freezinhot defaulted on its contractual obligations, and Con-Field incurred damages exceeding the bond amount. EASCO's arguments regarding 'labor-only' contracting and mutual termination were rejected.
