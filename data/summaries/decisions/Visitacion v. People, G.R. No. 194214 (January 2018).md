Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Marilou Punongbayan-Visitacion v. People of the Philippines and Carmelita P. Punongbayan*, G.R. No. 194214 (January 10, 2018).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Decision affirming RTC Judgment convicting Petitioner of Libel.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Libel Conviction:** Visitacion, as corporate secretary, wrote a letter to Punongbayan containing potentially defamatory statements. RTC convicted her, sentencing her to one year imprisonment and P3,000,000 in moral damages.

*   **Procedural Issue: Certiorari vs. Appeal:** CA dismissed Visitacion's Petition for Certiorari, arguing she should have filed an appeal.  The Supreme Court (SC), in the interest of substantial justice, treats the certiorari petition as an appeal, citing *Department of Education v. Cuanan*.

*   **Penalty for Libel:** Visitacion challenged the sentence, particularly the imprisonment. The SC invokes Administrative Circular (A.C.) No. 08-08 (Guidelines in the Imposition of Penalties in Libel Cases), which expresses a preference for fines over imprisonment, citing relevant case law.

*   **Moral Damages:**  Visitacion contested the amount of moral damages. The SC affirms the award is proper under Art. 2219(7) of the Civil Code, citing *Tulfo v. People* for allowing recovery of moral damages in libel cases. However, the SC finds the initial amount excessive and reduces it.

**SC Ruling:**

*   The SC **grants** the petition in part.
*   **Affirms** the conviction for libel.
*   **Modifies** the sentence to a fine of P6,000 (with subsidiary imprisonment if insolvent) and **reduces** moral damages to P500,000.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Visitacion is liable for the crime of libel.
*   Visitacion is obligated to pay a fine of P6,000 and moral damages of P500,000 to Punongbayan.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The document presents a legal matter regarding penalties of libel and the amounts of moral damages to be awarded.
*   The application of A.C. No. 08-08 is subject to judicial discretion; however, the SC emphasized preference for fines.
*   The assessment of damages in defamation cases remains highly fact-specific.
*   Subsidiary imprisonment applies if Visitacion is insolvent and cannot pay the fine.
