Okay, here's a legal summary of *Armed Forces and Police Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. vs. Ines Bolos Santiago*, G.R. No. 147559, June 27, 2008.

**Case Summary: Armed Forces and Police Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. vs. Ines Bolos Santiago, G.R. No. 147559, June 27, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision that affirmed the Land Registration Authority's (LRA) resolution requiring a court order to annotate a Notice of Levy on Attachment on a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT).

**Key Issue:**  Whether a Notice of Levy on Attachment, registered in the primary entry book *before* a Deed of Absolute Sale, takes precedence and can be annotated on the new TCT issued to the buyer (Santiago), and whether a court order is required for said annotation.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision, holding that the Notice of Levy on Attachment *can* and *must* be annotated on TCT No. PT-94912, and a court order *is* required to compel surrender of the title.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Registration as Constructive Notice (PD 1529, Sec. 52):**  Registration of any instrument affecting registered land (including attachments) serves as constructive notice to all persons. The SC emphasized that the registration is the operative act to convey or affect the land insofar as third persons are concerned.
*   **Priority of Registration:** The entry of the Notice of Levy in the primary entry book *prior* to the Deed of Absolute Sale creates a preference in favor of the attaching creditor (Petitioner).  Cites *Du v. Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc.*, G.R. No. 156580, June 14, 2004, 432 SCRA 43, and other cases.
*   **Duty of Register of Deeds (RoD):** The RoD should have annotated the Notice of Levy as it was properly presented and entered. The RoD's failure is attributable to the office, not the attaching creditor.
*   **Requirement to Surrender Certificate (PD 1529, Sec. 71):**  The registered owner (Santiago) is obligated to surrender the duplicate certificate for annotation of the involuntary lien (attachment). If the owner refuses, the Register of Deeds must report to the court for an order compelling the surrender.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Santiago's Risk:** While not explicitly stated, the ruling effectively nullifies/subordinates Santiago's claim to the property to the extent of the debt secured by the attachment. She's charged with constructive notice despite arguing bona fide purchase.
*   **Santiago's Duty:** Ordered to surrender TCT No. PT-94912 to the Register of Deeds for proper annotation. Failure to do so will result in court enforcement of the order.
*   **Register of Deeds' Duty:** Ordered to annotate the notice of levy on attachment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sections 51, 52, 71:** Crucial provisions outlining the effect of registration as constructive notice and the process for involuntary dealings with registered land.
*   **Levin v. Bass, 91 Phil. 420 (1952):** Distinguished between voluntary and involuntary registration, emphasizing that entry in the day book is sufficient notice for involuntary liens.
*   **Du v. Stronghold Insurance Co., Inc., G.R. No. 156580, June 14, 2004, 432 SCRA 43:** Cited to support the precedence of a registered attachment over a subsequent sale.
*   **Sec. 71** is the law being referred to where a court order is required when the owner fails to surrender title for annotation of involuntary lien.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Issues:**

*   **Bona Fide Purchaser Status:** The CA considered Santiago's bona fide purchaser defense. While the SC didn't directly rule her in bad faith, the constructive notice doctrine effectively negates a BFP defense. The burden is on her to prove absence of fraud.
*   **Jurisdiction of LRA vs. Courts:** The CA raised the issue of whether the LRA could determine bona fide purchaser status, a judicial question. The SC side-stepped this by focusing on constructive notice through registration.
*  **Potential Claim for Damages:** Depending on the circumstances, the Court may allow Ines Bolos Santiago to file a claim for damages if the loss suffered was due to the erroneous act of Aniana Estremadura and the Pasig Registry of Deeds.

**Key Takeaways:**

1.  Registration in the primary entry book is critical for establishing priority, especially for involuntary liens.
2.  Constructive notice is a powerful tool that can override claims of good faith.
3.  PD 1529, Sec. 71 is mandatory on the registered owner, requiring surrender of title to the Register of Deeds, to annotate and involuntary lien such as attachment. This is in order for the attachment or other liens to be effective and binding as to the land.
4.  RoDs have a ministerial duty to register valid instruments, but must seek a court order to compel surrender of duplicate certificates in involuntary dealings.
