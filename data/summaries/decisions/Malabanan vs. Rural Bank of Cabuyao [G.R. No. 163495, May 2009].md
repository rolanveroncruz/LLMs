## Legal Document Summary: *Malabanan v. Rural Bank of Cabuyao, Inc.*, G.R. No. 163495 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) reversal of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities' (MTCC) dismissal of an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage (REM):** Petitioner Malabanan executed an REM on 18 April 1996, securing a loan of P5,000,000.00 from Respondent Rural Bank of Cabuyao (RCB), on a property covered by TCT No. 255916. (There's a potential factual issue with the TCT number on the mortgage - see Ambiguities/Contentions).
*   **Dacion en Pago:** On 12 November 2001, Malabanan purportedly executed a *dacion en pago* transferring ownership of the mortgaged property to RCB in settlement of the loan, resulting in the issuance of TCT No. T-493506 in RCB's name.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:** RCB filed an unlawful detainer suit against Malabanan for refusal to vacate the property after demands. RCB alleges tolerance of Malabanan's occupancy after the *dacion*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Malabanan:** Obligated to vacate the property and surrender possession to RCB. *Originally obligated to pay the loan secured by the REM.*
*   **RCB:** Originally obligated to provide the loan.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Malabanan:** Potentially liable for reasonable rent for the unlawful detention, but the Supreme Court *deleted the awarded rentals due to lack of evidence to prove the actual fair rental value.*
*   **RCB:** Potential liability if the *dacion en pago* is successfully challenged in the pending annulment case.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Pending Annulment Case:** Malabanan filed a prior action for annulment of the *dacion en pago* and TCT No. T-493506, raising allegations of fraud and lack of consent. *Key Risk:* If Malabanan prevails in the annulment case, RCB's title and basis for the unlawful detainer action will be invalidated. This affects RCB's entitlement to possess the land.
*   **Litis Pendencia/Forum Shopping:** Malabanan argued that the ejectment case should be dismissed due to *litis pendencia* and forum shopping given the pending annulment case. This argument was rejected by the courts based on the principle that ejectment focuses on *de facto* possession, and any ownership determination is provisional.
*   **Dacion en Pago Validity:** Validity of the *dacion* is contested. Malabanan claims he never executed the document. The Court seemingly rejects it due to lack of proof.
*   **Technicality of TCT Numbers:** Discrepancy in TCT numbers between the REM and the actual title (265916 vs. 255916). While the court brushed it off as typographical, this could become significant if the description of land isn't aligned.
*   **Damages Claimed by the Bank:** The trial court awarded rentals sought by the Bank but the supreme court said that the bank failed to sufficiently prove the rental value.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 17 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Discusses the measure of damages in an ejectment case (limited to rent or fair rental value).
*   **General Principles on Ejectment/Unlawful Detainer:** Emphasizes that the sole issue in ejectment is physical possession, and ownership is only provisionally determined for possession purposes. Cites *Barnes v. Padilla* (G.R. No. 160753, 2005) and *Heirs of Rosendo Lasam v. Umengan* (G.R. No. 168156, 2006).
*   **Principles on *Litis Pendencia* and Forum Shopping:** Elements for establishing these defenses were discussed. Cites *Abines v. Bank of the Philippine Islands* (G.R. No. 167900, 2006).

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The execution and validity of the *dacion en pago* is a central contentious issue, directly impacting the title and possessory rights.
*   The ambiguity surrounding the title number (255916 vs 265916) needs to be investigated.
*   The assessment of whether there was indeed tolerance in granting the Bank's possession of the land is subject to scrutiny.

**Overall:** The Supreme Court upheld the ejectment order, focusing on the apparent validity of the *dacion en pago* and RCB's resulting title. However, the pending annulment case is a critical factor. The court emphasized the limited scope of ejectment proceedings. The decision affirms that the issue of rightful ownership is pending determination in separate appropriate proceeding.
