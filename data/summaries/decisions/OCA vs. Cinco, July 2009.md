## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator v. Cinco* (A.M. NO. P-06-2219)

**Overview:** This is an administrative case against Nilda C. Cinco, Officer-in-Charge and Legal Researcher of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Catbalogan, Samar, for simple neglect of duty, stemming from the loss of several case records. The Supreme Court (SC) found Cinco liable and imposed a penalty of suspension.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loss of Case Records:** Cinco reported the loss of five (later revised to seven) case records from Branch 28 of the RTC.
*   **Custodial Duty:** As Officer-in-Charge and Legal Researcher, Cinco was deemed the *de facto* Clerk of Court and, as such, held the primary duty to safely keep all court records, papers, files, and exhibits according to Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court. The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court also outlines these duties.
*   **Neglect of Duty:** The SC agreed with the Office of the Court Administrator's (OCA) evaluation that Cinco failed to exercise due diligence in safeguarding the records. Specifically, she admitted leaving cabinets unlocked, allowing open access to court personnel.
*   **Lack of Mitigation:** Cinco's defenses, including insufficient storage space and suspicion towards another employee (Lilia C. Raga), were deemed insufficient to excuse her negligence.
*   **Penalty:** Suspension for one month and one day without pay, with a warning against future similar acts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Cinco had a **statutory obligation** under Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court, and the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court to safeguard court records.
*   She was held **administratively liable** for simple neglect of duty due to her failure to properly secure the case records and inform the judge of storage deficiencies.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The document doesn't specifically define the extent of an Officer-in-Charge's responsibility vs a full clerk of court's responsibility.
*   **Potential for Appeal:** While unlikely to succeed, Cinco could argue for a lower penalty based on the lack of a formal appointment as Clerk of Court, potentially arguing the duties expected of her should be assessed at a lower standard of care.
*   **Second Offense Risk:** Any future similar incident could lead to dismissal, as the decision specifically warned against repetition of the same or similar conduct.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 7, Rule 136, Rules of Court:** Establishes the Clerk of Court's duty to safeguard records.
*   **2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court:** Outlines the duties of clerks of court.

The decision clarifies the standard of care required for those acting in the capacity of a Clerk of Court, regardless of their formal title.
