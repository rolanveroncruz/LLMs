## Legal Document Summary: *Pablo B. Malabanan v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 201821

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of an action for reversion of land and cancellation of title.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, affirming that the RTC has jurisdiction over the Republic's action for reversion of land because the action is against the title itself, not the judgment of the Land Registration Court. The SC emphasizes that the Republic alleges no judgment ever existed, and is not trying to annul a pre-existing judgment.
*   **Jurisdiction:**  Jurisdiction over subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint, the law at the time of filing, and the character of the relief sought (citing *Arzaga v. Copias*, *Padlan v. Dinglasan*, *Sta. Clara Homes Owners' Association v. Gaston*, *Commart (Phils.), Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Commission*). An action for reversion is properly filed with the RTC where the land is located.
*   **Reversion Suit Basis:** The Republic's complaint alleges that TCT No. T-24268 originated from OCT No. 0-17421, purportedly issued under Decree No. 589383 in L.R.C. Record No. 50573, but no copy of the judgment in that record could be found. Additionally, the land is within an unclassified public forest, rendering it inalienable.
*   **Remedy:** The ultimate relief sought is to revert the land to the government under the Regalian Doctrine (Section 101 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, the Public Land Act).
*   **Distinction from Annulment of Judgment:**  The Court distinguishes this case from *Estate of the Late Jesus S. Yujuico v. Republic*, *Collado v. Court of Appeals*, and *Republic v. Court of Appeals*, stating that those cases involved direct actions for annulment of judgments, whereas this case attacks the validity of the title itself, specifically due to the land's classification as unclassified public forest.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Pablo B. Malabanan (Petitioner):** Required to defend the validity of his title in the remanded proceedings before the RTC. Subject to potential loss of title if the Republic successfully proves its case for reversion.
*   **Republic of the Philippines:** Obligated to present evidence proving that the subject property is indeed part of the public domain and that no valid judgment authorized the issuance of OCT No. 0-17421.
*   **Other Defendants (Angelo B. Malabanan, Greenthumb Realty and Development Corporation):** Similarly situated as the petitioner and subject to the same obligations and potential liabilities.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The central issue revolves around whether a valid judgment was ever issued in L.R.C. Record No. 50573. This is a key factual question that will require significant evidence to resolve.
*   **Proof of Public Forest Classification:** The Republic must present convincing evidence that the land is within an unclassified public forest, which could involve historical land surveys, DENR classifications, and expert testimony.
*   **Derivative Titles:** The complaint identifies numerous derivative titles issued to Greenthumb and other Malabanans. Successfully reverting the land to the public domain could have far-reaching implications for these subsequent owners.
* **Res Judicata:** The RTC dismissal mentioned that similar complaints for reversion of the same parcel of land were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and that ownership had been upheld in decisions elevated to the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Assess the evidence available to both sides regarding the existence (or non-existence) of a judgment in L.R.C. Record No. 50573.
2.  Thoroughly investigate the land classification status of the property at the time of the alleged registration and currently.
3.  Analyze potential defenses based on good faith acquisition by subsequent owners and the possible application of laches, prescription, or estoppel against the government.
4. Consider the effect of the dismissal of a similar complaint for reversion by the RTC on July 14, 1997 based on Res Judicata.
