Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution in *Medina v. Lozada* (G.R. No. 185303), formatted for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Editha S. Medina, et al. v. Sps. Nicomedes and Brigida Lozada* (G.R. No. 185303, August 1, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing the CA's dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals (CA) decision to dismiss the Petition for Certiorari because the petitioners used an improper remedy. The RTC had dismissed the petitioners' complaint for "Quieting of Title, Reconveyance with Damages with Lis Pendens" (Civil Case No. 07-0041) based on *res judicata* citing a prior judgment in LRC No. M-24 rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 134 of Makati Metro Manila on February 23, 1989 confirming the title of applicant Nicomedes J. Lozada. The Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was also denied. Instead of appealing the RTC's final order, the Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) with the CA. The CA dismissed it, noting that appeal was the proper remedy. The Supreme Court agreed that because an appeal was available, certiorari was inappropriate.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The RTC initially dismissed the case based on *res judicata*, finding the four requisites present due to the prior land registration case (LRC No. M-24).
*   **Procedural Issue:**  The core issue is the propriety of the remedy. The petitioners filed a Rule 65 petition (certiorari) instead of an appeal (Rule 41) from the RTC's order of dismissal.
*   **Finality of Order:** The Supreme Court confirmed that the order dismissing the complaint was a final order, as it completely disposed of the case. It was not interlocutory.
*   **Exclusivity of Remedies:**  The Court reiterated the principle that remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive, not alternative or successive. Certiorari cannot substitute for a lost appeal due to negligence or error in choosing the remedy.
*   **Timeliness:** The Petitioners filed their CA petition for certiorari a day late, as they exceeded the 60-day period prescribed by Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** To have filed a timely appeal of the RTC's order dismissing the case.  Failure to do so resulted in loss of remedy.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Claim:** The dismissal based on *res judicata*, coupled with the failure to properly appeal, creates a substantial risk that the petitioners will be permanently barred from pursuing their claim to the subject property. The finality of the RTC's order, and the affirmed CA decision, create a strong *res judicata* barrier.

*   **Section 12, R.A. 296, The Judiciary Act of 1948, as amended**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's application of *res judicata* could be challenged if there were genuine arguments regarding a lack of identity of parties, subject matter, or cause of action between the current case and the prior land registration case. However, the petitioners' failure to properly appeal prevented a review of that issue on its merits.

This summary highlights the critical procedural error made by the petitioners and emphasizes the significant legal hurdle created by *res judicata*. Any further action would likely need to focus on extraordinary remedies, and would face a steep uphill battle.
