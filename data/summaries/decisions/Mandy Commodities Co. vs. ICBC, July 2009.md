**Case:** *Mandy Commodities Co., Inc. v. The International Commercial Bank of China* (G.R. No. 166734, July 3, 2009)

**Summary:**

Petitioner Mandy Commodities obtained loans from Respondent ICBC, secured by chattel mortgages over buildings on leased land. Mandy defaulted, ICBC extrajudicially foreclosed under Act No. 3135 (Real Estate Mortgage Law), and obtained a writ of possession. Mandy challenged the foreclosure, arguing the buildings were chattels under Act No. 1508 (Chattel Mortgage Law) and the foreclosure was invalid due to lack of personal notice. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's order granting the writ of possession. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed Mandyâ€™s petition under Rule 65, finding that it used the wrong remedy (certiorari instead of appeal) and failed to demonstrate grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Classification of Buildings:** The central issue is whether the buildings constituted real property or chattels. The agreement between Mandy and ICBC explicitly stipulated the buildings were to be treated as chattels, subject to chattel mortgage under the law.
*   **Foreclosure Law:** The foreclosure was conducted under Act No. 3135 (Real Estate Mortgage Law), despite the agreement classifying the buildings as chattels, which should have subjected the foreclosure to Act No. 1508 (Chattel Mortgage Law).
*   **Notice Requirements:** Act No. 1508 requires 10-day personal notice to the mortgagor, which was not complied with.
*   **Writ of Possession:** ICBC obtained a writ of possession pending redemption based on Section 7 of Act No. 3135. Mandy argues this is not available under Act No. 1508.
*   **Remedies:** Mandy incorrectly sought annulment of judgment (Rule 47) and certiorari (Rule 65) when an appeal was the proper remedy, which it failed to pursue within the required timeframe.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Mandy's Obligation:** To repay the loan of P20,000,000.00 plus interest.
*   **ICBC/ROP Philippines' Obligation:** To conduct a valid foreclosure sale in accordance with the correct law (Act No. 1508).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Foreclosure:** The foreclosure sale conducted under Act No. 3135 appears invalid due to the parties' explicit agreement that the buildings are considered chattels and should be governed by Act No. 1508.
*   **Writ of Possession:** The writ of possession was likely improperly issued, as it was based on Act No. 3135 and is not explicitly authorized under Act No. 1508 for chattel mortgages.
*   **Procedural Hurdles:** Mandy's repeated use of incorrect remedies has prejudiced its position.
*   **Doctrine of Estoppel:** Although the buildings were stipulated as chattels, the reliance by ICBC on Act 3135 in good faith, combined with Mandy's failure to properly appeal, might give rise to estoppel arguments.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutes:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Real Estate Mortgage Law):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages and provides for a writ of possession.
*   **Act No. 1508 (Chattel Mortgage Law):** Governs chattel mortgages and requires personal notice to the mortgagor.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 47:** Annulment of judgments, final orders, or resolutions based on lack of jurisdiction or extrinsic fraud.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Certiorari, available only when no appeal or other adequate remedy exists and requires grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** Principle violated by Mandy when it initially filed a Rule 45 petition directly to the Supreme Court.
*   *Alba v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 164041, July 29, 2005) and *Linzag v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 122181, June 26, 1998): Established the remedies for challenging CA decisions on annulment of judgment.
*   *Tagle v. Equitable PCI Bank* (G.R. No. 172299, April 22, 2008): Explains that remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive.

**Conclusion:**

While the agreement to treat the buildings as chattels suggests the foreclosure was conducted under the wrong law, Mandy's failure to pursue the correct legal remedies (primarily an appeal) has resulted in the dismissal of its case. The validity of the foreclosure remains questionable, however, ICBC/ROP Philippines may have a stronger claim for possession now due to Mandy's procedural missteps.
