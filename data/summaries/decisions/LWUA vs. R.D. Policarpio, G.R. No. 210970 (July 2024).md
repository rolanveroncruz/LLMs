Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) vs. R.D. Policarpio & Co., Inc. (RDPCI)*, G.R. No. 210970, July 22, 2024.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing the CA's decision affirming the CIAC Final Award which held LWUA solidarily liable with Butuan City Water District (BCWD) for RDPCI's monetary claims.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**
*   **Financial Assistance Contract:** LWUA granted BCWD a loan for a water supply improvement project funded by JBIC. LWUA acted as BCWD's "agent" for pre-qualifying bidders, awarding contracts, and disbursing payments.
*   **Construction Contract:** BCWD and RDPCI executed a construction contract for the project, which was approved by the LWUA.
*   **Supplemental Agreement:** Modified the construction contract, also approved by the LWUA.
*   **Dispute:** RDPCI claimed full performance but BCWD failed to pay. RDPCI filed a claim with the CIAC against both BCWD and LWUA.
*   **CIAC Award:** CIAC found LWUA solidarily liable with BCWD to RDPCI for work accomplishment, price escalation, retention money, interest, attorney's fees, and arbitration costs.  CIAC reasoned the LWUA acted more as a co-owner than an agent.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed CIAC's ruling.

**Issues:**
1.  **Party to Contract:** Is LWUA a party to the construction contract?
2.  **Solidary Liability:** If liable, is LWUA's liability solidary?
3.  **Attorney's Fees:** Is LWUA liable for attorney's fees and costs?

**Holding & Reasoning:**

1.  **Party to Contract:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that LWUA *is* a party to the Construction Contract. It rejected LWUA's argument that its approval was merely a regulatory function under P.D. 198, stating no provision of the law required the LWUA to approve any and all construction contracts entered into by local water districts. The SC found that LWUA's voluntary assumption of a approval role, and execution of a subsequent MOA, made it a party to the Construction Contract.
2.  **Solidary Liability:** The SC affirmed the solidary liability. While no express agreement or statute required it, the *nature* of the obligation did. Referring to Article 1207 of the Civil Code, where a "nature of obligation requires solidarity," it found:
    *   **Purpose:** The LWUA and the BCWD had a Financial Assistance Contract for the former to be able to finance the Project. It would not be possible for the BCWD to continue the project with out the LWUA's loan.
    *   **Contractual Terms:** The contract stipulated that the LWUA would disburse all payments, not just the loan to the BCWD. This showed intent to be directly obligated.
    *   **Indivisible Obligation:** The delineation of liabilities between LWUA and BCWD was too difficult to separate and a finding of joint liability would cause unjust enrichment to the BCWD.
3.  **Attorney's Fees:** The SC upheld the award of attorney's fees and arbitration costs to RDPCI.  RDPCI was compelled to litigate due to LWUA and BCWD's inaction, justifying the award under Article 2208 of the Civil Code. CIAC rules of procedure governing construction arbitration are followed.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1207 (solidary obligations), 1371 (interpreting contracts), 1868 (agency), 1953 (loan obligations), 2208 (attorney's fees).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 198:** *Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973.* Addressed in terms of LWUA's functions and regulatory role.
*   **CIAC Rules of Procedure:** Addressed in the context of Arbitration.

*   **Reyes v. Lim:** Discusses unjust enrichment

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Agency vs. Co-Ownership:** The central contentious point is whether LWUA truly acted only as an agent of BCWD, or crossed the line to assume duties and controls that establish co-ownership-like responsibilities.
*   **Indemnity:** No mention of a cross-claim for indemnity by LWUA against BCWD. This might be a lost opportunity to mitigate LWUA's financial burden.
*   **COA Decision:** The final and executory COA decision granting the money claim against the BCWD and dismissing the claim against the LWUA for lack of jurisdiction, in the face of pending action with the SC, creates additional complication for enforcement.

This summary should provide a solid legal overview of the document.
