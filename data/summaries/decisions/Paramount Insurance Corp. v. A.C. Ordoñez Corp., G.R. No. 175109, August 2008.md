Here's a concise legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Paramount Insurance Corp. v. A.C. Ordo単ez Corporation and Franklin Suspine*, G.R. No. 175109, August 6, 2008 (583 Phil. 321).

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision that reversed the RTC and reinstated the MTC Orders admitting the respondent's Answer and setting the case for pre-trial. The case originates from a vehicular accident where Paramount, as subrogee, sued A.C. Ordo単ez and its driver Suspine for damages.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Service of Summons:** The core issue is the validity of service of summons on A.C. Ordo単ez Corp. The SC held that service to the Receiving Section (Samuel D. Marcoleta) was invalid under Section 11, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, which requires service to specific officers (president, general manager, etc.). *Villarosa v. Benito*, 370 Phil. 921 (1999), and *Mason v. Court of Appeals*, 459 Phil. 689 (2003), are cited to emphasize the strict compliance required. The Court emphasized that the argument for substantial compliance no longer applies.

*   **Default:** The petitioner's motions to declare the respondents in default were deemed premature due to the invalid service.

*   **Admission of Answer:** The MTC's admission of the Answer, despite being filed beyond the extended deadline, was upheld, citing the court's discretion under Sec. 11, Rule 11 and the disfavoring of default judgments. *Delos Santos v. Carpio*, G.R. No. 153696, September 11, 2006, 501 SCRA 390, 403 is cited.

*   **Corporate Existence:** The petitioner questioned the respondent's legal personality to appeal due to possible corporate dissolution. The SC invoked Section 122 and 145 of the Corporation Code, stating that a dissolved corporation retains the capacity to prosecute and defend suits within three years for liquidation purposes and that dissolution does not impair existing rights or liabilities. *Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 145855, November 24, 2004, 443 SCRA 580, 594 and *Knecht v. United Cigarette Corporation*, 433 Phil. 380, 395 (2002) are cited.

*   **Mediation:** The Court found no error in not referring the case to mediation, noting the absence of the required notation or written request by the petitioner for mediation.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The primary obligation at stake is the payment of damages resulting from the vehicular accident. Liability depends on proving negligence of the respondent Suspine, and A.C. Ordo単ez's potential vicarious liability as the employer.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Defective Service:** The initial defective service significantly prejudiced the petitioner's case, delaying proceedings and allowing the respondent to file an Answer.
*   **Delay:** The long procedural history of the case presents a risk of further delays.
*   **Proof of Negligence:** The petitioner must still prove the negligence of the respondent driver and the vicarious liability of the corporation to ultimately recover damages.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 11, Rule 11 Sec. 11
*   Corporation Code, Sections 122, 145.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Section 11, Rule 14, and the strict interpretation thereof, remains the contentious point. The definition of those authorized to receive summons is critical.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision. The key takeaway is the strict interpretation of service of summons requirements under Section 11, Rule 14. Petitioner needs to ensure proper service to proceed with the case on the merits.
