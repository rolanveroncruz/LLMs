**Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Yulo, G.R. No. 166756, October 10, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA decision affirming MTC decision in a land registration case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Property:** A parcel of land in Lingayen, Pangasinan, originally owned by spouses Santiago and Maria Samson, later acquired by Marceliano Samson, and subsequently inherited by Fe Ramona Versoza Samson and Katrina Isabel Samson Yulo (Respondent). Area in dispute, originating from inconsistencies in deed descriptions (686 sq. m. vs. combined tax declarations showing 2,385 sq. m.) resolved using the total land area covered by the tax declarations.
*   **Extrajudicial Settlement:** Heirs of Santiago and Maria Samson executed an extrajudicial settlement and ratification of sale to Marceliano Samson. Marceliano's heirs (Versoza Samson and respondent) later executed a deed of extrajudicial settlement dividing the property.
*   **Land Registration:** Respondent filed an application for land registration in MTC, which was granted. The Republic appealed to the CA, which affirmed the MTC decision.
*   **Costs:** The CA imposed costs against the Republic.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondent:** To prove valid claim to the land sought for registration based on inheritance and ownership.
*   **Republic:** To present valid legal grounds opposing the land registration.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the Republic faced potential liability for costs, which was ultimately removed by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Area Descriptions:** The discrepancy in the area description (686 sq. m. in the extrajudicial settlement vs. the area based on Tax Declaration Nos. 21671 and 10353, and the area as a result of an official survey) posed a risk to the respondent's claim.  While ultimately resolved in the respondent's favor, a more thorough investigation of historical land records might be warranted.
*   **Heirship of Respondent:** The Rollo contains conflicting information regarding whether Marceliano Samson had legitimate or adopted children, and whether Katrina Isabel Samson Yulo is in fact a compulsory heir of Marceliano. This needs further investigation.
*   **Cost Imposition:**  The CA's imposition of costs against the Republic was a potential risk, ultimately mitigated by the Supreme Court's application of Rule 142, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 142, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Regarding imposition of costs against the Republic.
*   **Demafelis v. CA, G.R. No. 152164, 23 November 2007:** Affirms that the factual findings of lower courts cannot be disturbed in a petition for review on certiorari
*   **Republic v. Hidalgo, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1959, 9 December 2005, 477 SCRA 32, 44:** Jurisprudence that costs are not recoverable against petitioner unless otherwise provided by law.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The area description in the "extrajudicial settlement and ratification of an absolute deed of sale" (686 sq. m.) vs. the land described in the tax declarations (2,385 sq. m.), and the later surveyed area (1,270 sq. m.) was a contentious issue. The Supreme Court resolved this, siding with the CA in the decision, but not without the need for thorough analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, affirming the CA's decision on the land registration but deleting the imposition of costs against the Republic. The identification of the land subject to the registration was a crucial point, with discrepancies in area descriptions initially posing a risk to the respondent's claim.
