**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Banaag, Jr.* (G.R. No. 269657)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Leonardo Banaag, Jr. for Murder (Art. 248, RPC) and Attempted Murder (Art. 248 & Art. 6, RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Guilty Verdict Affirmed (Murder & Attempted Murder):** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's conviction of Banaag for the murder of Jovelito Agustin and the attempted murder of Joseph Agustin.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony (Joseph Agustin):** The SC upheld the credibility of Joseph's testimony, emphasizing that lower courts' assessment of witness credibility is given great weight. *People v. Enriquez, Jr.* (854 Phil. 609 (2019))* Joseph's positive identification of Banaag as the shooter was critical.
*   **Treachery Upheld:** The SC found that treachery qualified both crimes, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, depriving the victims of any opportunity to defend themselves. *People v. Guro* (851 Phil. 1041, 1045 (2019)).  Prior death threats did not negate treachery because the execution of the attack was swift and prevented retaliation. *People v. Ortiz, Jr.* (638 Phil. 521 (2010)).
*   **Evident Premeditation Disproven:** The SC agreed with the CA that evident premeditation was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecution failed to establish: (1) when the offender determined to commit the crime, (2) an act manifestly indicating that he clung to his determination, and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Banaag is guilty of murder and attempted murder.
*   **Penalties:**
    *   Murder: *Reclusion Perpetua* (Art. 248, RPC)
    *   Attempted Murder: Indeterminate sentence of six (6) years of *prision correccional* (minimum) to eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor* (maximum).
*   **Civil Liabilities:**
    *   To Joseph Agustin (Attempted Murder): Civil indemnity (PHP 25,000.00), moral damages (PHP 25,000.00), and exemplary damages (PHP 25,000.00).
    *   To Heirs of Jovelito Agustin (Murder): Civil indemnity (PHP 75,000.00), moral damages (PHP 75,000.00), exemplary damages (PHP 75,000.00), and temperate damages (PHP 50,000.00).
*   **Interest:** All damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. *Nacar v. Gallery Frames and/or Felipe Bordey, Jr.* (716 Phil. 267 (2013))
*   **Crediting Detention Period:** Banaag shall be credited with the period of his detention during the pendency of the case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Credibility:** The conviction hinges heavily on Joseph Agustin's eyewitness account. While the SC deferred to the lower courts' assessment of credibility, challenges could arise if new evidence surfaces that undermines Joseph's testimony. Accused-appellant challenged Joseph's identification, asserting that the latter could not have clearly seen the assailant since the crime scene was not wellÂ­-lit.
*   **Treachery:** Accused-appellant averred that treachery is absent in this case because the victims were already forewarned of the attack. Although Jovelito had been receiving threats days before his death, and despite Joseph seeing the assailants before the attack, the victims remained unsuspecting of the impending danger in their lives on that fateful night.
*   **Alibi:** Banaag's defense of alibi was deemed weak. However, any corroborating evidence that surfaces proving his presence elsewhere during the time of the crime could impact the conviction.
