Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided *People v. Domingo* decision:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Joel Domingo* G.R. No. 204895, March 21, 2018

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant, Joel Domingo, for two counts of Murder (Art. 248, RPC) and one count of Attempted Murder (Art. 248, RPC in relation to Art. 6, RPC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Right to Speedy Trial (Section 14(2), Art. III, 1987 Constitution):** The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision, holding that the accused-appellant's right to a speedy trial was violated. The SC applied the *Barker v. Wingo* (407 U.S. 514 (1972)) four-factor test: length of delay, reason for delay, defendant's assertion of the right, and prejudice to the defendant.  It found the delays were unreasonable, primarily due to the prosecution's failure to present evidence despite multiple scheduled hearings. The prosecution's excuse of witness unavailability due to "threats" was deemed unsubstantiated. The SC emphasized that unjustified postponements offend the right to a speedy trial *People v. Tampal* (314 Phil. 35 (1995)).

*   **Double Jeopardy (Section 21, Art. III, 1987 Constitution; Rule 117, Section 7, Rules of Court):** The SC held that the RTC's initial dismissal (February Order) of the cases, due to the prosecution's failure to present evidence, constituted an *acquittal* because it was predicated on a violation of the right to a speedy trial.  Therefore, the subsequent reconsideration (June Order) of that dismissal and the continuation of the trial placed the accused-appellant in double jeopardy.  The SC distinguished this case from *Portugal v. Reantaso* (249 Phil. 671 (1988)), et al., where the prosecution had been denied a fair opportunity to present evidence due to grave abuse of discretion by the trial court. Here, the prosecution was given ample opportunity. *Salcedo v. Mendoza* (177 Phil. 749 (1979)) applied; dismissal based on speedy trial violation is an acquittal.

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Although unnecessary given the speedy trial ruling, the SC also found the prosecution's evidence insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The sole eyewitness testimony (Roque Bareng) was inconsistent on material points, eroding his credibility. *People v. Amon* (218 Phil. 355, 361 (1984)) applied.  The accused-appellant's alibi was deemed credible and corroborated.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reconsideration of Dismissal:** The RTC's act of reconsidering its dismissal based on its perceived denial of the State's right to due process is the central contentious point. The SC found that the RTC erred by concluding that the state was not given fair opportunity to present evidence

*   **Witness Credibility:** Discrepancies in witness descriptions of the assailants weakens the case of the prosecution

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and acquitted Joel Domingo. The decision emphasizes the constitutional right to a speedy trial and the protection against double jeopardy. The court highlights the importance of ensuring the prosecution does not prolong a case against an accused.
