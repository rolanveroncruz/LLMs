**Case Summary: Hidalgo v. Velasco, G.R. No. 202217 (April 25, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's ruling that the MCTC lacked jurisdiction over the Petitioner's complaint for Unlawful Detainer and Damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether the MCTC had jurisdiction over the petitioner's ejectment complaint, specifically whether the complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action for unlawful detainer or forcible entry.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal of the ejectment complaint. The MCTC lacked jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Rule 70, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Defines forcible entry and unlawful detainer actions.
*   **Elements of Unlawful Detainer (as per Cabrera v. Getaruela, 604 Phil. 59 (2009)):** Complaint must allege:
    *   Initial possession by defendant by contract or tolerance of the plaintiff.
    *   Subsequent illegality of possession upon notice of termination by plaintiff.
    *   Defendant's continued possession depriving plaintiff of enjoyment.
    *   Complaint filed within one year from the last demand to vacate.
*   **One-Year Filing Period for Forcible Entry (Nuñez v. Slteas Phoenix Solutions, Inc., 632 Phil. 143 (2010)):**  Period counted from actual entry, or from discovery of entry if it was through stealth.

**Liabilities & Remedies:**
*   **Dismissal of Ejectment Complaint:** The court dismissed the unlawful detainer complaint because petitioner failed to show there was a landlord-tenant relationship and that demand to vacate was within a year.
* Accion Publiciana or Accion Reinvindicatoria : The supreme court noted if the parties felt their rights were violated, they could pursue appropriate actions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Failure to Plead Jurisdictional Facts:** The complaint's lack of averments regarding prior possession by tolerance (unlawful detainer) or the specific date of entry (forcible entry) was fatal to jurisdiction.
*   **Time Barred Forcible Entry:** Even if the complaint were construed as one for forcible entry, the filing occurred more than one year after the petitioner's discovery of the respondent's possession, rendering the action time-barred.
*   **Ambiguity in Characterizing the Action:**  The Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts in that the pleading did not include all of the relevant information that could show either tolerance or how dispossession occurred.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 70 of the Rules of Court:** Governs ejectment suits (forcible entry and unlawful detainer).
*   **Cabrera v. Getaruela, 604 Phil. 59 (2009):** Defines elements of unlawful detainer.
*   **Zacarias v. Anacay, 744 Phil. 201 (2014):** Distinguishes between forcible entry and unlawful detainer based on allegations in the complaint.
*   **Nuñez v. Slteas Phoenix Solutions, Inc., 632 Phil. 143 (2010):**  Discusses the one-year period for filing a forcible entry suit.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**
*   The original Deed of Donation created the ambiguity in this case.

**Conclusion:**

The petitioner's complaint failed to establish the jurisdictional facts necessary for either unlawful detainer or forcible entry, leading to its dismissal. Counsel should advise the client that an *accion publiciana* or *accion reinvindicatoria* may be more appropriate if the client intends to pursue ownership.
