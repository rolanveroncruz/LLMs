Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the *Flauta v. COMELEC* case:

**Case:** *Rafael Flauta, Jr., et al. v. Commission on Elections, et al.* G.R. No. 184586, July 22, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition assailing COMELEC's Resolution denying a petition to nullify Statements of Votes by Precinct (SOVPs) and instead treating it as a petition to correct manifest errors.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Election Context:** May 15, 2007 local elections in Senator Ninoy Aquino, Sultan Kudarat. Rafael Flauta, Jr. (Petitioner) proclaimed mayor.
*   **Disrupted Canvassing:** Canvassing proceedings disrupted by explosions and gunfire.
*   **Missing SOVPs:** Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBOC) members (Bernan & Collantes) absconded with SOVPs covering 81/106 precincts. The SBOC canvassed the remaining twenty-five (25) precincts but did not proclaim the winners due to the failure of Melicano Bernan and Julio Collantes to surrender the SOVPs they took with them.
*   **COMELEC Orders:** Commissioner Brawner initially ordered nullification of the missing SOVPs and a re-canvassing.
*   **Proclamation:** SBOC, seemingly unaware of the order, proclaimed Flauta, Jr. and other petitioners (Vice Mayor and Sangguniang Bayan members).
*   **Manganaan's Action:** Dante Manganaan (private respondent) filed a petition to annul the proclamation.
*   **COMELEC Resolution:** COMELEC denied the petition to nullify SOVPs but treated it as a petition to correct manifest errors, ordered annulment of Flauta's proclamation, rectification of errors, and a new proclamation.  It also directed investigation of MBOC members Bernan and Collantes.
*   **Subsequent Events:** The SBOC reconvened and proclaimed Manganaan as mayor, who took his oath. Flauta filed an election protest with the RTC.

**Issues Raised by Petitioners:**

1.  Grave abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of Manganaan's Motion for Reconsideration.
2.  Grave abuse of discretion in treating the petition as one for correction of manifest errors.
3.  Propriety of correcting manifest errors after proclamation.
4.  Violation of due process.

**Ruling and Rationale:**

*   **Petition Dismissed.** The Supreme Court affirmed the COMELEC resolution.
*   **COMELEC's Broad Powers:**  The Court emphasized COMELEC's broad constitutional power to administer election laws, supervise boards of canvassers, and ensure fair elections. (Citing *O'hara v. COMELEC* and *Benito v. COMELEC*)
*   **Exception to Prohibited Pleadings:** The Court held that even though motion for reconsideration of an en banc resolution of the Commission is not allowed, an exception exists as when the case involves an election offense (*Section 1. What Pleadings are not Allowed. - The following pleadings are not allowed: x x x x d) motion for reconsideration of an en banc ruling, resolution, order or decision except in election offense cases; x x x x.* )
*   **Correction of Manifest Errors:** The Court upheld the COMELEC's authority to *motu proprio* correct manifest errors in SOVPs, even after proclamation. *Duremdes v. COMELEC* and *Castromayor v. COMELEC* were cited as precedent.
*   **Integrity of SOVPs:** The Court highlighted that the Statement of Votes (SOV) is a vital component of the electoral process; it supports the Certificate of Canvass and is the basis for proclamation. Its preparation is an administrative function of the Board of Canvassers, a purely mechanical act the performance of which the COMELEC has direct control and supervision. ( citing *Milla v. Balmores-Laxa*,)
*   **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Given the anomalous circumstances (missing SOVPs, irregularities), COMELEC acted within its discretion to determine the true will of the electorate.
*   **Due Process:**  Petitioners' due process arguments were rejected because they had an opportunity to be heard.

**Potential Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Election Offenses:** The COMELEC was directed to investigate the MBOC members (Bernan and Collantes) for potential election offenses (e.g., tampering with votes, violating ballot integrity).
*   **Nullified Proclamation:**  Flauta's initial proclamation was nullified, and he was effectively removed from office based on the corrected canvass.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *O'hara v. COMELEC*, G.R. Nos. 148941-42, March 12, 2002, 379 SCRA 247
*   *Benito v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 106053, August 17, 1994, 235 SCRA 436.
*   *Alejandro v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 167101, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 427.
*   *Milla v. Balmores-Laxa*, G.R. No. 151216, July 18, 2003, 401 SCRA 679.
*   *Duremdes v. COMELEC*, G.R. Nos. 86362-63, October 27, 1989, 178 SCRA 746.
*   *Castromayor v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 120426, November 23, 1995, 250 SCRA 298.
*   *Punzalan v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 132435, April 27, 1998, 289 SCRA 702.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The COMELEC's ability to suspend its own rules "in the interest of justice."  This creates flexibility but also potential for abuse.
*   The classification of errors as "manifest" and the standard of review for the COMELEC's determination of such errors.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 4, Rule 1 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   Republic Act No. 6646 (The Electoral Reforms Law of 1987), Section 27 (b).
*   B.P. Blg. 881, as amended, Sec. 261 (z) (21).
*   Id., Sec. 261 (z) (15).

This summary highlights the COMELEC's broad authority, the narrow interpretation of procedural rules in election cases, and the emphasis on ascertaining the true will of the electorate. It also flags potential liabilities for individuals involved in election irregularities.
