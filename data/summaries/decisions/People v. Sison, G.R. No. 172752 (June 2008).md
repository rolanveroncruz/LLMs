**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Rodolfo Sison*
**G.R. No.:** 172752
**Date:** June 18, 2008
**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, convicting Rodolfo Sison of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The conviction stemmed from the fatal shooting of Bernabe dela Cruz on November 25, 1993.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Positive Identification:** The Court affirmed the trial court's assessment of witness credibility. The eyewitness testimonies of Bernadette, Bernie, Bernalyn, and Lydia were found credible and positively identified Sison as the shooter. Their testimonies established the events leading to and including the shooting beyond a reasonable doubt. The court stated that appellate courts will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, unless there appears in the record some facts or circumstances of weight and influence which have been overlooked and, if considered, would affect the result. *People v. Agbayani, G.R. No. 122770, January 16, 1998, 284 SCRA 315.*
*   **Denial as Defense:** Sison's denial was deemed a weak defense and was outweighed by the positive identification by witnesses. *People v. Sernadilla, G.R. No. 137696, January 24, 2001, 350 SCRA 243.*
*   **Qualifying Circumstance: Treachery (Alevosia):** The Court found that the shooting was qualified by treachery (alevosia) as defined in Article 14(6) of the Revised Penal Code. The sudden, unexpected attack on the unarmed victim, Bernabe dela Cruz, without warning or opportunity to defend himself, constituted treachery. The essence of treachery lies in the attack which comes without warning, and is swift, deliberate and unexpected, and affords the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape, ensuring its commission without risk to the aggressor, without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim. *People v. Baltazar, G.R. No. 143126, July 31, 2003, 407 SCRA 542.*
*   **Lack of Evident Premeditation:** The Court agreed that the prosecution did not adequately prove evident premeditation. There was no evidence of a plan or preparation to kill, or sufficient time to reflect between the stoning incident and the shooting. In order that evident premeditation may be appreciated, the following requisites must concur: (1) the time when accused decided to commit the crime; (2) an overt act manifestly indicating that he has clung to his determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between decision and execution to allow accused to reflect upon the consequences of the act. *People v. Ventura, G.R. Nos. 148145-46, July 5, 2004, 433 SCRA 389, 400.*

**Liabilities and Damages:**

*   **Reclusion Perpetua:** Sison was sentenced to reclusion perpetua as prescribed under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for murder.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000.00.
*   **Moral Damages:** P50,000.00.
*   **Temperate Damages:** P25,000.00 (in lieu of actual damages, which were insufficiently proven beyond P6,030.00).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P25,000.00 (due to the presence of treachery).
*   *People v. Werba, G.R. No. 144599, June 9, 2004, 431 SCRA 482.*

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The acquittal on the charge of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunition is final.
*   The damages are standard given the time.
*   Co-accused Sendaydiego remains at large, potentially creating evidentiary or jurisdictional issues if apprehended.
*   The Court could have further discussed the application of "treachery" given the proximity in time between the stoning and the shooting; that the victim knew of danger.
