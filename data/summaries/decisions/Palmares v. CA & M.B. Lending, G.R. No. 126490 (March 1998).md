**Case Summary: *Palmares v. Court of Appeals and M.B. Lending Corporation*, G.R. No. 126490, March 31, 1998 (351 Phil. 664)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari involving a promissory note where petitioner Palmares signed as co-maker. The central issue is whether Palmares is liable as a surety or a guarantor.

**Facts:** M.B. Lending extended a loan to Spouses Azarraga and Palmares. Palmares signed as a co-maker and bound herself "jointly and severally or solidarily" liable. The Azarragas defaulted. M.B. Lending sued Palmares alone. Palmares argued she was only a guarantor and the interest and penalties were unconscionable. RTC dismissed the case against Palmares. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding her liable as a surety.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Note Clause:** Palmares agreed she was "jointly and severally or solidarily" liable. She also agreed M.B. Lending could demand payment from her if Azarraga defaulted.
*   **Interest Rate:** 6% per annum compounded every 30 days.
*   **Penalty Charge:** 3% per month on the outstanding balance.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** 25% of the total amount due.

**Court Holding:** Supreme Court affirmed CA's decision, holding Palmares liable as a *surety*, but modified the award by deleting the penalty interest and reducing attorney's fees.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Surety vs. Guarantor:** The Court emphasized the distinction between a surety (insurer of the *debt*) and a guarantor (insurer of the *solvency* of the debtor). Palmares' explicit agreement to be solidarily liable made her a surety. The phrase about demanding payment upon default did not negate her status as a surety.
*   **Interpretation of Contract:** The Court applied the principle that clear contractual terms prevail. Palmares expressly agreed to be solidarily liable. Her claims of misunderstanding the terms were rejected.
*   **Contemporaneous and Subsequent Acts:** Palmares's actions, like offering to settle and payments issued in her name, indicated she understood her solidary liability.
*   **Demand:** Demand on the principal debtor (Azarragas) was not required, as the promissory note waived notice and demand. Commencement of the suit against the surety is already sufficient demand.
*   **Suit Against Surety Alone:** M.B. Lending had the right to sue Palmares alone due to her solidary liability. Creditor's rights exists independently of the right to proceed against the principal.
*   **Unconscionable Penalties:** The Court *did* find the 3% per month penalty charge and 25% attorney's fees unconscionable and reduced/deleted them, citing Article 1229 of the Civil Code and *Magallanes v. Court of Appeals* where similar interest and penalty charges were considered excessive.

**Liabilities:**

*   Palmares is liable for the outstanding principal of P13,700.00.
*   Interest at 6% per month from the date the loan was contracted until fully paid.
*   Attorney's fees of P10,000.00

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Contract of Adhesion Argument:** While the court acknowledged Palmares' argument that the promissory note was a contract of adhesion, it did not find it invalid *per se*. However, the fact that it was a contract of adhesion did play a factor in the mitigation of the penalties and attorney's fees.
*   **Usurious Interest Argument:** While the Usury Law is no longer enforced, the Court still retains the power to reduce unconscionable interest rates. Here, only the penalty charge was deemed excessive, not the base interest.
*   **Mitigation of Damages Argument:** Palmares' argument that she offered to pay but was refused was dismissed, as the offers were insufficient to cover the total amount due (including interest) based on the original contract.

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case reinforces the distinction between a surety and a guarantor.  The language of the promissory note is critical. The "jointly and severally or solidarily" language is key to establishing Palmares's liability as a surety. The court's analysis of Palmares's conduct strengthens the argument. While the contract of adhesion argument and the potential for usurious interest initially appear as potential defenses, they ultimately fall short due to the explicit language of the contract. The mitigation of attorney's fees serves as a partial win, indicating the court's willingness to scrutinize even seemingly standard contractual clauses for fairness. Any strategy defending a surety needs to focus on either proving lack of consent, misrepresentation, or a material alteration of the principal obligation without the surety's consent. Arguing the unconscionability of interest and fees, while possibly leading to mitigation, will not negate the underlying surety obligation based on this precedent.
