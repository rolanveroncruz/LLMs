## Legal Document Summary: Dimayuga-Laurena v. Court of Appeals & Laurena (G.R. No. 159220)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review assailing CA decision in a declaration of nullity of marriage case)

**Case Summary:** Petitioner sought the declaration of nullity of her marriage based on the psychological incapacity of the respondent. The RTC denied the petition but dissolved the conjugal partnership of gains. The CA affirmed the denial of the petition and the dissolution of the partnership but excluded certain properties, claiming they belonged to the respondent's parents. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision with a modification.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** The core provision regarding psychological incapacity as a ground for nullity of marriage.
*   **Dissolution of Conjugal Partnership of Gains:** Despite the denial of the nullity petition, the CA and SC upheld the dissolution due to abandonment and separation.
*   **Determination of Conjugal Properties:** Dispute over specific properties and whether they were part of the conjugal partnership or belonged to the respondent's parents.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner had the burden to prove the respondent's psychological incapacity. (Republic v. CA - Molina case)
*   **Support of Children:** Parents are obligated to support their children in proportion to their respective incomes.
*   **Division of Conjugal Assets:** Upon dissolution, the conjugal assets are subject to partition.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Expert Testimony/Medical Examination:** The court emphasized the need for medical/clinical identification of psychological incapacity, though not necessarily requiring a direct examination. Relying solely on the petitioner's account and a brief interview by the expert weakens the claim.
*   **Proof of Judicial Antecedence:** The petitioner failed to adequately prove that the psychological incapacity existed at the time of the marriage.
*   **Characterization of Properties:** Determination of whether specific properties were part of the conjugal partnership or separate property of the respondent's parents was contested. The SC included the duplex house and lot on Dayap Street, Makati City in the conjugal partnership of gains.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Basis for the nullity petition.
*   **Articles 68-71 and 220, 221, 225, Family Code:** Defines essential marital obligations.
*   **Article 55, Family Code:** Defines grounds for legal separation.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals (310 Phil. 21):** Established the criteria of gravity, judicial antecedence, and incurability for psychological incapacity.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals (Molina case, G.R. No. 108763):** Set guidelines for interpreting and applying Article 36.
*   **Marcos v. Marcos (397 Phil. 840):** Affirmed expert examination not required in finding psychological incapacity.
*  **Republic v. Cuison-Melgar, G.R. No. 139676, 31 March 2006: Affirmed expert examination not required in finding psychological incapacity.
*   **Republic v. Cabantug-Baguio, G.R. No. 171042, 30 June 2008: Affirmed root cause of psychological incapacity must be medically or clinically identified.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of Psychological Incapacity:** The application of Article 36 remains highly fact-specific and subject to judicial interpretation.
*   **Proof of Source of Funds:** Disputes over the origin of funds used to purchase properties, affecting their characterization as conjugal or separate.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the denial of the petition for declaration of nullity of marriage, emphasizing the need for a strong evidentiary basis to prove psychological incapacity under Article 36. The Court sustained in part the dissolution of the conjugal partnership of gains and modified the CA decision by including the duplex house and lot on Dayap Street, Makati City in the conjugal partnership of gains.
