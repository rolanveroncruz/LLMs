**Legal Document Summary: *Martin v. Dela Cruz*, A.C. No. 9832**

**Nature of Document:** Resolution amending a prior Resolution in an administrative case regarding attorney misconduct.

**Case Summary:** Lolita R. Martin filed a complaint against Atty. Jesus M. Dela Cruz for failure to return a P60,000 acceptance fee.  A prior Resolution (September 4, 2017) found Dela Cruz guilty of violating Rules 18.03 and 18.04, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (failure to render adequate legal service despite accepting a fee) and suspended him from the practice of law for six months. However, the dispositive portion of the original Resolution failed to explicitly order restitution of the P60,000. This current Resolution amends the original dispositive portion to include that directive.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Finding of Guilt:** Atty. Dela Cruz found guilty of violating Rules 18.03 and 18.04, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   **Suspension:**  Atty. Dela Cruz is suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months, effective from the finality of the original September 4, 2017 Resolution.
*   **Restitution Order:**  Atty. Dela Cruz is ordered to return P60,000 to Lolita R. Martin within ninety (90) days from the finality of the *present* Resolution.
*   **Manifestation Requirement:** Atty. Dela Cruz must file a Manifestation with the Court, copying all relevant courts/quasi-judicial bodies, indicating the start date of his suspension (i.e., date of receipt of original resolution). This is essential to accurately track the suspension period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Financial Liability:**  Failure to return the P60,000 constitutes non-compliance with a court order.
*   **Disciplinary Liability:** Continued misconduct (repetition of similar acts) will result in a more severe penalty.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** Failure to comply with the restitution order within 90 days of the finality of this Resolution could subject Atty. Dela Cruz to contempt proceedings and further sanctions.
*   **Prolonged Suspension/Disbarment:**  Repetition of similar misconduct could lead to a longer suspension or disbarment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules 18.03 & 18.04, Canon 18, Code of Professional Responsibility:** This is the basis for the finding of administrative liability.  Implies a lawyer must serve a client competently and diligently.
*   **People v. Lacbayan, 393 Phil. 800, 810 (2000); Cobarrubias v. People, 612 Phil. 984, 996 (2009):** The court cites this as general rule on fallo (dispositive portion) prevailing over the body of the decision.
*   **People v. Cilot, GR. No. 208410, October 19, 2016, 806 SCRA 575, 593;  Spouses Rebuldela v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 239 Phil. 487, 494 (1987):** Exception to the fallo rule, where clear mistake in dispositive portion allows the body of the decision to prevail.
*   **Tuatis v. Spouses Escol, 619 Phil. 465 (2009); So v. Food Fest Land, Inc., 657 Phil. 604, 606 (2011):** The court cites this as justification for amending the dispositive portion even after finality, to correct ambiguity/omission.
*   **Doctrine of *Quantum Meruit* (implied):** While not explicitly mentioned, the underlying principle of *quantum meruit* (reasonable value of services rendered) is relevant. The court's decision hinges on the fact that no legal service was provided to justify retaining the acceptance fee.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Finality of this Resolution":** There could be a dispute over when the 90-day period for restitution begins. Does it refer to the finality of the *original* September 4, 2017 Resolution (arguable since the issue of restitution was decided then) or the finality of *this* amending Resolution? The safer interpretation is the finality of *this* resolution to avoid any potential issues.

**Recommendations:**

*   Atty. Dela Cruz should immediately comply with the restitution order to avoid further sanctions.
*   Atty. Dela Cruz must carefully track the finality date of this amending Resolution to ensure timely restitution.
*   Atty. Dela Cruz should file the required Manifestation promptly, clearly indicating the date he received the original Resolution.
