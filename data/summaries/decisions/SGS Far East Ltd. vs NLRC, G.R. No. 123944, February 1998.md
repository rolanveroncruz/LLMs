**Legal Document Summary: *SGS Far East Ltd. vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 123944, February 12, 1998***

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.

**Core Issue:** Whether the NLRC erred in dismissing SGS's appeal against a Labor Arbiter's order of execution, particularly concerning the computation of monetary awards stipulated within a previous Compromise Agreement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **1982 Compromise Agreement:** SGS agreed to recognize 13 employees as regular seasonal daily-paid, pay them P50,000 in settlement of wage claims (NLRC Case No. NCR-2-2095-82), maintain existing employment terms, comply with labor laws, and prioritize them for Manila office vacancies.
*   **Subsequent Claims (1985):** Four employees (Ortiz, Forbes, Lim, Gallardo) alleged non-compliance with the agreement, failure to provide work, violations of labor laws, and denial of priority in employment.
*   **Labor Arbiter Tumanon's Decision (1989):** Ruled in favor of the employees, ordering monetary payment (P20,129.43 each), reinstatement with backwages (3 years based on comparable promoted employees), and strict compliance with the Compromise Agreement.
*   **Original Supreme Court Ruling in G.R. No. 101698:** Affirmed Labor Arbiter Tumanon's jurisdiction.
*   **Disputed Computation:** Wide disparity between employees' computation (P4,806,052.41) and SGS's (P298,552.48). Labor Arbiter Reyes approved the employees' computation.
*   **NLRC's Dismissal:** Initially dismissed SGS's appeal on the ground that the order of execution was merely ministerial.

**Obligations:**

*   **SGS:** Compliance with the 1982 Compromise Agreement, including wage obligations, reinstatement terms, and labor law compliance. Also, the computation of the Labor Arbiter needs to be paid to the affected parties.
*   **Employees:** Obligations stemming from the initial Deed of Release and Quitclaim, although the scope of that release is being contested regarding claims arising *after* the agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for substantial backwages and monetary awards if the Labor Arbiter's computation is upheld.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Excessive Monetary Award:** The core risk is the affirmed exorbitant monetary award, which SGS argues deviates from the judgment's tenor. This includes the computation of backwages (base salary) and the award of 200% monthly basic pay.
*   **Scope of Compromise Agreement:** Ambiguity exists regarding the scope of the Compromise Agreement and whether it covers claims arising after its execution, and whether the release and quitclaim covers future situations.
*   **Enforcement:** Risk of immediate execution and seizure of assets if SGS fails to obtain relief from the NLRC.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Allied Free Workers' Union versus Estipona, L-17934, December 28, 1961, 3 SCRA 780:** Cited by NLRC, but deemed inapplicable by the Supreme Court in this context.
*   **Service Specialists, Inc. versus Sheriff of Manila, 145 SCRA 130:** Cited by NLRC regarding the need for a preliminary injunction to stay execution.
*   **Republic versus Reyes, 71 SCRA 430:** Cited by NLRC regarding the ministerial duty to execute final judgments.
*   **GSIS v. Court of Appeals, et al., 218 SCRA 233 (1993).**: Cited by the Supreme Court.
*   **Bliss Development Corporation v. NLRC, 247 SCRA 808 (1995).**: NLRC has the authority to look into the correctness of the execution of the decision and to consider supervening events that may affect such execution.
*   **Madado v. CA, 185 SCRA 80 (1990); Pacific Mills, Inc. v. NLRC, 181 SCRA 130 (1990).**: Cited by the Supreme Court, regarding NLRC's authority to look into correctness of execution.
*   **Matriguina Integrated Wood Products v. CA, G.R. No. 98310, October 24, 1996.:** Where the execution is not in harmony with the judgment which gives it life and exceeds it, it has pro tanto no validity.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 217 (b) of the Labor Code:** Relates to the appellate jurisdiction of the NLRC.
*   **Section 2(a), Rule VI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC:** Concerns appeals to the NLRC.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Computation of Backwages:** Specific method of computing backwages ("last three years' salaries of employees with substantially the same length of service who were given promotions") is highly contentious and open to interpretation, leading to the discrepancy in calculations.
*   **"200% monthly basic pay for every year of service":** The order requires that "200% monthly basic pay for every year of service was even awarded on top of other questionable amounts."
*   **Scope of Compromise Agreement:** The clause regarding future compliance with labor laws is broad and may create uncertainty regarding SGS's ongoing obligations.

**Legal Strategy:**

*   Focus on demonstrating that the Labor Arbiter's computation is manifestly excessive, unsupported by the original decision, and potentially a deprivation of property without due process.
*   Appeal and potentially seek injunctive relief to stay execution pending resolution of the appeal before the NLRC.
*   Aggressively contest the basis for the "200% monthly basic pay for every year of service" award.
*   Present the correct computation of the monetary award for the court to review.
