**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 07-8-207-MTC**

**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning the judicial audit of a Municipal Trial Court (MTC) judge for improper archiving of criminal cases during preliminary investigation.

**Parties:**
*   **Subject:** Judge Justino G. Aventurado (formerly Acting Judge of MTC, Asuncion, Davao del Norte, now Presiding Judge of RTC, Tagum City, Davao del Norte, Branch 2).
*   **Complainant:** Office of the Court Administrator (OCA).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Violation:** Judge Aventurado archived two criminal cases (Crim. Case Nos. 664 & 811) instead of forwarding them to the Provincial Prosecutor's Office after preliminary investigation, citing the accused's non-arrest as the reason. This violated Rule 112, Sec. 5 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure (now 2000 Rules), which mandates forwarding the records.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Fine of P5,000 for failure to follow procedure and apparent ignorance of the law.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Affirmed Violation:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the violation of Rule 112, Sec. 5.
*   **Rejected "Ignorance" finding:** Disagreed with the OCA's "apparent ignorance" finding, citing Judge Aventurado's prior experience as a prosecutor and the relatively few errors out of many cases.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Noted that this was Judge Aventurado's first offense, he acknowledged his mistake, and apologized.
*   **Reduced Penalty:** Reduced the fine from P5,000 to P2,000.
*   **No Warning:** Removed the OCA's warning of harsher penalties for future violations, as A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC had removed preliminary investigation duties from first-level court judges, and the judge was now at the RTC level.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 112, Sec. 5, 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure (now 2000 Rules):** Defines the duty of the investigating judge to transmit records to the prosecutor.
*   **A.M. No. 05-8-26-SC:** Removed preliminary investigation duties from first-level court judges.
*   **Castro v. Bartolome, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1589:** Cited by OCA for imposing a P20,000 fine for undue delay. Distinguished because Judge Aventurado did not deny the need to forward records and had no prior offenses.
*   **Agcaoili v. Aquino, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1051:** Cited by OCA for imposing a P5,000 fine for not following procedure. Used as basis for the initial fine recommendation.
*   **Ora v. Almajar, A.M. No. MTJ-05-1599:** Cited by OCA for imposing a P2,000 fine for ignorance of preliminary investigation rules.

**Obligations:**

*   Judge Aventurado had a clear obligation to forward the case records to the Provincial Prosecutor after the preliminary investigation.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Aventurado was found administratively liable for failure to follow the rules and fined P2,000.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While the penalty was relatively minor, any future violations, if possible under the new rules, could result in more severe sanctions.
*   This administrative case could be considered in any future evaluation for promotion or other career advancements.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The OCA's initial finding of "apparent ignorance" of the law was contentious and ultimately rejected by the SC.  The SC emphasized that an error does not automatically equate to ignorance, especially considering the judge's prior experience.
