**Case:** *Metroheights Subdivision Homeowners Association, Inc. v. CMS Construction and Development Corporation, et al.* G.R. No. 209359, October 17, 2018 (842 Phil. 293)

**Summary:**
The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and reinstated with modification, the RTC decision, finding CMS Construction and MWSS jointly and severally liable for damages due to abuse of rights under Article 19 of the Civil Code. The case involves the disconnection and transfer of Metroheights Subdivision's existing water service connection by CMS Construction, contracted by MWSS, without proper notice or consent, causing a water service interruption. The Court found that the respondents failed to exercise their rights to manage and maintain the water supply system with justice, honesty, and good faith, thereby abusing their rights to the detriment of the petitioner. The individual directors/officers of CMS Construction (the Cruzes) were not held personally liable.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Abuse of Rights (Art. 19, Civil Code):**  Respondents MWSS and CMS Construction abused their right to manage the water supply system by cutting off and transferring Metroheights' existing water service connection without prior notice or consent, failing to act with justice, honesty, and good faith. *See Manila Gas Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 188 Phil. 582 (1980); MWSS v. Act Theater, Inc., 476 Phil. 486 (2004).* Elements of abuse of rights: (1) legal right or duty; (2) exercised in bad faith; (3) sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another.
*   **Notice Requirement:** The Court emphasized the importance of prior notice to the homeowners before any changes were made to their water supply, especially since the homeowners paid for the existing connection.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** MWSS and CMS Construction are held jointly and severally liable for the damages, based on their concerted actions.
*   **No Personal Liability for Directors/Officers:** The Cruzes, directors/officers of CMS Construction, were not held personally liable, as the petitioner failed to prove they acted in a way that warrants piercing the corporate veil as per Sec. 31 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual Damages:** Reduced from P190,000.00 to P161,541.85, based on the amount duly proven by checks. *See Dee Hua Liong Electrical Equipment Corp. v. Reyes, 230 Phil. 101, 106 (1986).*
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** P100,000.00 awarded.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** P50,000.00 awarded.
    *   **No Nominal Damages:** No award of nominal damages since actual damages were awarded. *See Dr. Armovit v. Court of Appeals, 263 Phil. 412, 421 (1990).*
    *   **Legal Interest:** 6% per annum on all monetary awards from finality of the decision until fully paid, per prevailing jurisprudence *See Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al., 716 Phil. 267 (2013).*

**Obligations:**

*   MWSS and CMS Construction must jointly and severally pay Metroheights Subdivision Homeowners Association, Inc. the sums awarded for actual damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of the suit.
*   Compliance with the final decision and payment of interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   MWSS and CMS Construction are jointly and severally liable for the awarded damages due to abuse of rights.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collection Issues:** Potential difficulties in collecting the judgment amount from the defendants.
*   **Interest Accrual:** Continued accrual of legal interest on the outstanding judgment amount until fully paid.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Specific Evidence of Notice:** The ambiguity surrounding the prior notice given to the homeowners and the lack of documentary evidence significantly influenced the court's decision. The absence of verifiable proof of notice strengthens the case for abuse of right.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 19, New Civil Code:** Abuse of rights.
*   **Section 31, Corporation Code:** Liability of directors, trustees, or officers.
