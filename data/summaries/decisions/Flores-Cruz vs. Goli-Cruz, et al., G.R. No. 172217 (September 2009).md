**Case Summary: Flores-Cruz v. Goli-Cruz, G.R. No. 172217 (2009)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution on a Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Dispute:** Petitioners (Flores-Cruz spouses) filed a complaint for recovery of possession (accion publiciana) in the RTC against respondents (Goli-Cruz spouses et al.) occupying a portion of land purchased by the petitioners from Lydia Flores-Cruz's siblings in 1999.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Respondents claimed possession for 10-20 years, asserting the land was alienable public land, later paying real estate taxes.
*   **Procedural History:** RTC ruled in favor of the Petitioners. CA reversed, holding the RTC lacked jurisdiction.
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC affirmed the CA's decision, finding the RTC lacked jurisdiction.

**Key Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the RTC or MTC had jurisdiction over the action for recovery of possession.

**Analysis & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Nature of Action (Unlawful Detainer vs. Accion Publiciana):** The SC determined the nature of the action based solely on the allegations in the complaint. Petitioners' complaint indicated possession by tolerance. They alleged that their predecessor-in-interest, Estanislao Flores, allowed the respondents to occupy the land. The demand to vacate occurred less than one year prior to filing the complaint.
*   **Unlawful Detainer (Rule 70):** The Court found the allegations supported a complaint for unlawful detainer, which falls under the jurisdiction of the MTC, per Rule 70 of the Rules of Court. The original permission or tolerance of possession must be present at the beginning.
*   **RA 7691 & Assessed Value:** The SC highlighted the impact of RA 7691, which expanded MTC jurisdiction over actions involving title or possession of real property, depending on the assessed value. The complaint failed to allege the assessed value of the property, making it impossible to determine if the RTC had jurisdiction under RA 7691. The court can *motu proprio* raise the issue of jurisdiction.
*   **Accion Publiciana Threshold:** Because the demand to vacate occurred less than a year prior to filing the complaint, the Petitioners could not use *accion publiciana*.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Rules of Court:** Governs actions for forcible entry and unlawful detainer.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), as amended by RA 7691:** Defines jurisdiction of various courts.
*   **RA 7691, Sec. 19 & 33:** Expands MTC jurisdiction over real property actions based on assessed value.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Improper Forum:** Filing in the wrong court resulted in a null and void judgment and wasted resources.
*   **Missed Deadline:** Delay in properly filing the case in the MTC could result in the claim being time-barred under Rule 70.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The question of whether the initial tolerance occurred and can be proven.
*   The respondents' claims of owning the land based on it being classified as alienable public land.

**Recommendations:**

*   Assess the current assessed value of the property to confirm jurisdictional threshold.
*   Consider filing a new complaint for unlawful detainer in the MTC, ensuring all jurisdictional requirements are met, and within the prescribed period.
*   Gather evidence to rebut the claim that the land is alienable public land and confirm the legality of the transfer of title to the petitioners.
