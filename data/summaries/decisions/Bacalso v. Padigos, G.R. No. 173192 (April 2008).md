## Legal Document Summary - G.R. NO. 173192

**Case:** *Rosendo Bacalso, et al. vs. Maximo Padigos, et al.* (Quieting of Title, Declaration of Nullity of Documents, Recovery of Possession, and Damages)

**Key Issue:**  Validity of Deeds of Sale and Acquisitive Prescription of Lot No. 3781.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals and *dismissed* the RTC case, finding for Petitioners (Bacalsos).

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Indispensable Parties:** The Court ruled that the failure to implead all indispensable parties, specifically Teodulfo Padigos, an heir of Simplicio, rendered the proceedings null and void, citing *Arcelona v. Court of Appeals*, 345 Phil. 250 (1997).
*   **Authenticity of Deeds of Sale (Exhibits 3-9):** The Court found that the Respondents (Padigos, et al.) failed to prove forgery of the Deeds of Sale by preponderance of evidence. The Court gave more weight to the testimony of the Petitioners’ expert witness (Espina), emphasizing the need for a clear and convincing showing to overcome the presumption of regularity of notarized documents, citing *Ferancullo v. Ferancullo, A.C. No. 7214*.
*   **Expert Testimony:** The Court discredited the opinion of the Respondents' expert witness (Vaño) regarding the genuineness of signatures, finding the methodology flawed and biased and noting the trial court’s improper limitation of cross-examination.
*   **Laches:**  The Court held that the Respondents were guilty of laches.  While prescription does not run against registered land, *even a registered owner may be barred from recovering possession of property by virtue of laches*, citing *Rumarate v. Hernandez, G.R. No. 168222.* The Court noted the Petitioners' continuous possession since the 1950s, tax declarations, and other actions indicative of ownership, which the Respondents should have been aware of.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The original RTC decision ordering the Petitioners to pay actual/compensatory damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses was reversed.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Demolition of Lessees' Houses:** While the Court acknowledged the problematic demolition of houses belonging to the lessees, it couldn’t grant relief since they weren’t parties to the case. This raises potential collateral issues and possible separate claims by the lessees based on due process violations.
*   **Heirs' Claims:** The ruling could potentially be challenged by un-impleaded heirs, although the doctrine of laches may serve as a bar to the majority. However, any minors who have inherited shares may be able to take legal recourse when they reach the age of majority.

**Statutory References:**
