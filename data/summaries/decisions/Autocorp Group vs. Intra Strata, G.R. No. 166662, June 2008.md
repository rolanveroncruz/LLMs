**Legal Document Summary: *Autocorp Group vs. Intra Strata Assurance Corporation and Bureau of Customs***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 166662, June 27, 2008 (578 Phil. 804)

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari affirming Court of Appeals decision, which in turn affirmed with modification the RTC decision.

**Key Issue:** Liability of Autocorp Group and Peter Y. Rodriguez (petitioners) to Intra Strata Assurance Corporation (ISAC) as surety under Indemnity Agreements for bonds issued in favor of the Bureau of Customs (BOC).  Specifically, whether the obligation is due and demandable absent actual forfeiture of the bonds by the BOC, and the propriety of impleading the BOC.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Indemnity Agreements:** Petitioners agreed to jointly and severally indemnify ISAC against all losses, costs, etc., arising from ISAC's suretyship, including 25% attorney's fees. Significant clauses include:
    *   Maturity of Obligation: ISAC can proceed against petitioners even prior to paying the BOC, upon becoming legally liable under the bonds or demand by the BOC.
    *   Incontestability of Payment: Payments by ISAC are final and not disputable.
    *   Waiver of Venue: Makati is the exclusive venue.
    *   Waiver of Rights: Waiver of rights and benefits under Articles 2077, 2078, 2079, 2080 and 2081, of the Civil Code.
    *   Primary Liability: Petitioners' liability is joint and several, and primary to that of the principal.
    *   Renewals and Alterations: ISAC is authorized to grant extensions/modifications without a new indemnity agreement.

*   **Bonds:** ISAC issued re-export bonds to guarantee the re-export of vehicles or payment of duties and taxes by Autocorp. Autocorp failed to re-export or pay.
*   **Civil Code Provisions:** The court discusses Art. 2071 (Guarantor's recourse against debtor before payment), Art. 2079 (Extension granted to debtor by creditor) and Arts. 2067 and 1303 (Subrogation).

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable to ISAC for the face value of the bonds (P1,034,649.00), and attorney's fees (originally 25% reduced by CA) based on the Indemnity Agreements. The Supreme Court sustained the CAâ€™s modified award.
*   Peter Y. Rodriguez is jointly and severally liable, despite arguments regarding amendments without consent, due to his surety agreement and the authorization granted to ISAC to modify the bonds.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prematurity of Action:** Petitioners argue that the action is premature absent actual forfeiture. The court rejected this, relying on the Indemnity Agreement's clause allowing ISAC to proceed upon becoming *legally liable* under the bonds, regardless of actual forfeiture or payment. The broad language of the Indemnity Agreement shifts risk significantly to Autocorp.  This clause is a key point of contention.
*   **Improper Joinder of BOC:** Petitioners challenged the inclusion of BOC as a party. The court deemed BOC a necessary party under Rule 3, Section 8 of the Rules of Court, as complete relief required its presence.
*   **Application of Art. 2079, Civil Code (Extension of Time):** While the Court initially incorrectly stated that a surety is not covered by the Civil Code provisions on Guarantee, the SC did note that the indemnity agreement had a waiver clause allowing ISAC to grant the extension of time, so the court then found Rodriguez and Autocorp to be liable. 

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. v. Mutuc, 158 Phil. 699 (1974)*:  Validates agreements where sureties are liable for bond extensions without needing a new agreement or notice.
*   *Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. v. Batu Corporation and Company, 101 Phil. 494, 501 (1957)*: Discussed the applicability of provisions of the Civil Code on Guarantee to a surety.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Articles 1169, 1170, 1303, 2067, 2071, 2079
*   Rules of Court, Rule 3, Sections 8, 10, 11

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the liability of Autocorp and Rodriguez to ISAC based on the Indemnity Agreements.  The contentious clause allowing ISAC to sue before actual forfeiture and the broad waiver provisions are critical to this outcome. The Supreme Court addressed and found no fault in the joinder of the BOC as a party. Petitioners' arguments regarding prematurity and Rodriguez's exoneration were rejected. This case highlights the importance of carefully reviewing indemnity agreements, especially clauses regarding liability triggers and waivers.
