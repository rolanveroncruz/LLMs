## Legal Document Summary: Luna v. Luna, G.R. No. 177624

**Subject:** Recovery of Ownership and Possession/Annulment of Title (Action for Reconveyance)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Modesta Luna (daughter of deceased Pedro Luna, claiming donee of portion of subject property)
*   **Respondents:** Juliana P. Luna (daughter of deceased Pedro Luna, granted free patent), Cornelio, Milagros, Renato, Flordelita, Aurora, Andrito, and George, all surnamed Garcilla (siblings who acquired titles post-subdivision)

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Donation:** Petitioner claims donation of 2,268 sq m of land from Pedro Luna in 1950.
*   **Free Patent:** Respondent Juliana Luna was issued a free patent in 1976 over 3,431 sq m, including 1,100 sq m of the allegedly donated land.
*   **Subdivision and Titles:** Subsequent subdivision in 1994 and issuance of TCTs to respondents covering portions of the donated land.
*   **Prescription:** Critical issue is whether the action to recover the property and annul the title prescribed.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents' Liability:** Potentially liable to vacate the premises and pay damages if petitioner's claim prevails. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the cause of action had prescribed.
*   **Petitioner's Risk:** Failure to bring action within the prescriptive period. Reliance on donation without proper documentation. Risk that the property was public land at inception.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 32:** Relates to reopening or revising decrees of registration based on fraud, but subject to a one-year limitation.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 40, Sections 7 and 8:** Applied by the RTC to assume jurisdiction, even though the MTC lacked initial jurisdiction (later reversed by CA).
*   **Action for Reconveyance (Implied or Constructive Trust):** Key legal theory. SC holds that the 10-year prescriptive period applies, counted from the issuance of title. Cited: *Khemani v. Heirs of Anastacio Trinidad, G.R. No. 147340, December 13, 2007*; *Heirs of Maximo Sanjorjo v. Heirs of Manuel Y. Quijano, G.R. No. 140457, January 19, 2005*; *Katon v. Palanca, Jr., G.R. No. 151149, September 7, 2004*; *Millena v. Court of Appeals, 381 Phil. 132, 138 (2000).*
* *Mendizabal v. Apao, G.R. No. 143185, February 20, 2006*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of Property:** Whether the property was private land (donation) or public land at the time the free patent was granted. The CA determined it was public land.
*   **Possession:** The exception to the 10-year prescriptive period only applies when the person enforcing the trust is in possession of the property.
*   **Prescription as a Defense:** Whether the CA can *motu proprio* raise the issue of prescription when not pleaded by the respondents. The Court ruled it could, where it is apparent on the face of the complaint.

**Legal Analysis and Potential Arguments:**

*   The key issue is the prescription of the action. The CA correctly applied the 10-year prescriptive period for actions for reconveyance based on implied trust, running from the issuance of the title in 1976. The action was filed 23 years later in 1999.
*   Petitioner's argument that the prescriptive period is 30 years is incorrect.
*   The fact that the issue of prescription was not raised in the pleadings is irrelevant as the CA can *motu proprio* dismiss the action when prescription is evident on the face of the complaint.
*   There is potential issue on whether the underlying land was private or public but the CA has already said it's public.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision dismissing Modesta Luna's complaint based on prescription. The action for reconveyance was filed well beyond the 10-year prescriptive period. The arguments against prescription were unavailing.
