## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ascarraga*, G.R. No. 222337

**Case:** Appeal from CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder.

**Key Provision:** Finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

**Facts:** Appellant, Sherniel Ungriano Ascarraga, was convicted for the murder of Rodrigo Borgonia y Montesines. The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony identifying Ascarraga as the shooter. The defense presented an alibi, which was rejected by the RTC and CA. The victim was shot in the forehead during a flag ceremony.

**Obligations:**

*   The appellant is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The appellant is obligated to pay damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Murder.
*   Civil liability for damages, including civil indemnity, actual damages, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Damages:**

*   **Civil Indemnity:** P75,000.00
*   **Actual Damages:** P75,000.00 (supported by receipts)
*   **Moral Damages:** P75,000.00 (increased by SC)
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P75,000.00 (increased by SC)
*   **Legal Interest:** 6% per annum on all damages from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid, as per *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Identification:**  The appellant challenged the credibility of the eyewitness identification, arguing that a witness' eyesight was impaired and the police line-up was suggestive. However, the Court found that the positive in-court identification cured any defect in the out-of-court identification, citing *People v. Rivera*, 458 Phil. 856. The reliability of the eyewitness testimony is a crucial aspect of the conviction.
*   **Alibi:** The defense's alibi was rejected by both lower courts.  Alibi is considered a weak defense and the appellant bears the burden of proving it to the point of reasonable doubt.
*   **Motive:** The appellant argued lack of motive. The Court correctly stated that motive is not an element of murder, citing *People v. Babor*, 772 Phil. 252. However, establishing motive can strengthen the prosecution's case, and its absence might be considered in further appeals if other evidence is weak.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (Murder):** Defines the crime and its elements.
*   **People v. Rivera, 458 Phil. 856:** Deals with the admissibility of in-court identification despite potential flaws in pre-trial identification procedures.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806:**  Sets the guidelines for awarding damages and legal interest in criminal cases.
*   **People v. Babor, 772 Phil. 252:**  Affirms that motive is not an element of Murder.

**Ambiguities:** No apparent ambiguities.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for murder, increasing the amounts awarded for moral and exemplary damages. The key issue revolves around the credibility of the eyewitness identification, which the Court found to be sufficient despite the appellant's challenges. The alibi was weak, and motive was not deemed essential. Future legal challenges may focus on attacking the reliability of the eyewitness testimony, or seek a re-evaluation of the evidence.
