## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Ong v. Roban Lending Corp.* (G.R. No. 172592, July 9, 2008)

**Overview:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and the RTC, declaring a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Dacion in Payment Agreement (DPA) between Spouses Ong (Petitioners) and Roban Lending Corporation (Respondent) null and void for constituting *pactum commissorium*, prohibited under Article 2088 of the Civil Code. The case was remanded for accounting due to disputed partial loan payments.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Loans & Security:** Petitioners obtained loans from Respondent totaling P4,000,000.00, secured by a real estate mortgage. This was later consolidated into P5,916,117.50, reflected in the MOA and DPA.
*   ***Pactum Commissorium***: The Court found that the MOA and DPA constitute *pactum commissorium*. Elements met: (1) mortgaged property as security, (2) automatic appropriation by creditor (Roban) upon non-payment within the stipulated period (one year) absent foreclosure or redemption provisions.
*   **Dacion en Pago vs. Security:** The Court distinguished this case from a true *dacion en pago* (Art. 1245, Civil Code).  Here, the transfer was for security, not satisfaction of debt. The Petitioners still executed a promissory note after the DPA. *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 348 Phil. 15 (1998)*, was cited to distinguish between security and satisfaction of debt.
*   **Unconscionable Interest and Penalties:** The court found the interest rate (3.5% monthly or 42% annually) and penalties (5% monthly on the total amount due) to be unconscionable. Cites *Poltan v. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. No. 164307, March 5, 2007* as jurisprudence for reducing unconscionable rates.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The attorney's fees (25% of principal, interests, interests thereon, and penalties) were also deemed unconscionable and reduced to 25% of the principal amount only.
*   **Procedural Issues:**
    *   **Improper Summary Judgment:** The Court held that a summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact existed, specifically the issue of partial payments requiring evidence.
    *   **No Judgment on the Pleadings:** A judgment on the pleadings was also improper because Respondent's answer disputed material allegations made by Petitioners.
*   **Remand for Accounting:** The case was remanded to the RTC for an accounting of the loan, requiring evidence on alleged partial payments by the Petitioners, which Roban denies.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** Petitioners remain liable for the principal loan, subject to the modified interest and penalty rates. They must present evidence to support claims of partial payment.
*   **Respondent's Liability:** Respondent's MOA and DPA were declared void. They are obligated to provide an accounting of the loan and cannot enforce the original, unconscionable interest and penalty provisions.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accounting Dispute:** The accounting process may be contentious. Respondent may dispute Petitioners' claims of partial payment. The accuracy of records will be critical.
*   **Interpretation of Payment Application:** How payments were applied (principal, interest, penalties) will be crucial in the accounting.
*   **Further Litigation:** Disagreements during the accounting process may lead to further appeals.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Article 2088, Civil Code (Pactum Commissorium):** Prohibits the creditor from appropriating or disposing of things given by way of pledge or mortgage.
*   **Article 1245, Civil Code (Dacion en Pago):** Defines *dacion en pago* as a special form of payment where the debtor alienates property to the creditor in satisfaction of a monetary obligation.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 348 Phil. 15 (1998)*: Case clarifying the distinction between *dacion en pago* and the use of property as security.**
*   ***Poltan v. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. No. 164307, March 5, 2007:* Case citing jurisprudence for reducing unconscionable rates.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around whether the DPA was a genuine *dacion en pago* or a means of circumventing the prohibition against *pactum commissorium*. The court determined it to be the latter.

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly review Respondent's loan records to prepare for the accounting.
*   Gather all possible evidence of partial payments made by the Petitioners.
*   Be prepared to argue against any attempt by Respondent to apply payments in a manner that maximizes their benefit.
*   Carefully monitor the RTC proceedings during the accounting to ensure fairness and accuracy.
