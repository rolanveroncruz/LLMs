**Legal Document Summary: *Consolidated Distillers of the Far East, Inc. v. Rogel N. Zaragoza*, G.R. No. 229302**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming NLRC decision, which in turn modified the LA's resolution regarding the execution of a prior illegal dismissal judgment (G.R. No. 196038).

**Key Issue:** Computation of backwages and separation pay following a final judgment of illegal dismissal, supervening event (asset purchase agreement), and subsequent order for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Prior Judgment (G.R. No. 196038):** Condis was found liable for illegal dismissal of Zaragoza and ordered to reinstate him with full backwages. This became final and executory on March 30, 2012.
*   **Supervening Event (Asset Purchase Agreement with EDI):** Condis argued that the asset purchase agreement with Emperador Distillers made reinstatement impossible. The CA affirmed that a supervening event occurred.
*   **NLRC and CA Decisions:** The NLRC directed the payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. The CA affirmed with modification that the backwages should be computed from the date of illegal dismissal until finality of the CA decision, and separation pay computed from the date of employment until finality of the CA Decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**  Partially granted the petition. Affirmed the CA decision with modification. Condis is liable for backwages from illegal dismissal and separation pay from start of employment until the finality of the *present* Supreme Court decision. Hotel, meal allowances, and monthly incentive not included in the computation, triggering the immutability of judgement rule. Ordered to pay legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of decision until full satisfaction.

**Liabilities:**

*   Payment of backwages (computed per the Labor Arbiter's Decision dated March 3, 2009): basic pay, 13th month pay, and monetized vacation and sick leaves
*   Payment of separation pay (1 month salary per year of service).
*   Payment of legal interest (6% per annum) from the finality of the Supreme Court decision until full satisfaction.
*   Deduction of P454,986.98 already received by Zaragoza.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Bani Rural Bank, Inc. v. De Guzman:**  Applied to support the ruling that backwages are computed until the finality of the decision ordering separation pay when a supervening event makes reinstatement impossible.
*   **Olympia Housing, Inc. v. Lapastora:**  Distinguished as inapplicable.  Olympia Housing requires proof of full and compliant business closure *before* the finality of the award.
*   **Rule on Immutability of Judgments:**  Cited to prevent the inclusion of allowances not included in the original LA decision that became final and executory.
*   **Labor Code:** Impliedly invoked regarding illegal dismissal, reinstatement, and separation pay.
*   **Civil Code:** Impliedly invoked regarding interest on monetary awards.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Recomputation of Awards:**  The Labor Arbiter is ordered to recompute, increasing the risk of disputes over the correct amounts.
*   **Enforcement Proceedings:** Condis faces enforcement proceedings if it fails to comply with the Court's order.
*   **Interest Accrual:** Ongoing interest accrual until full satisfaction, increasing the total liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's reference to the "finality of this Decision" (referring to the CA's own decision) in its computation order could have caused confusion, but the Supreme Court clarified that it is their final decision that matters for computation purposes.

**Recommendations:**

*   Conduct a precise recomputation of backwages and separation pay in accordance with the Supreme Court's directives, adhering to the items specified in the Labor Arbiter's Decision dated March 3, 2009.
*   Ensure prompt payment of the adjudicated amounts to avoid further interest accrual and enforcement actions.
*   Review the basis for the original illegal dismissal ruling (G.R. No. 196038) to avoid similar situations in the future.
