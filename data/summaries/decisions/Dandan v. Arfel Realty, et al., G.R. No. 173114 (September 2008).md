## Legal Document Summary: *Jayson Dandan v. Arfel Realty & Management Corp.* (G.R. No. 173114)

**Case Overview:** This case concerns a dispute over a Memorandum of Agreement (the "Agreement") where Dandan allegedly assumed Arfel Realty's liabilities arising from a prior Contract to Sell with the Sauros. The central issue is the Agreement's validity, specifically regarding consent and consideration.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:** Arfel Realty sold a property to Dandan, knowing of a prior contract with the Sauros.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement:** Dandan allegedly agreed to assume Arfel Realty's liabilities from the prior contract with the Sauros, holding Arfel Realty harmless. The agreement stated the consideration for the sale to Dandan was the balance due from the Sauro's prior contract.
*   **Specific Performance Suit:** The Sauros sued Arfel Realty for specific performance. Arfel Realty filed a third-party complaint against Dandan, seeking indemnification based on the Agreement.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Dandan's Alleged Obligation:** To indemnify Arfel Realty for any judgment against it in favor of the Sauros, based on the Agreement.
*   **Arfel Realty's Obligation to Sauros:** Initially, to deliver title to Sauros. Later, after litigation, to refund payments made by the Sauros.
*   **Sauro's Obligation:** Originally, to pay the full purchase price of the property. Later, they were entitled to a refund due to Arfel Realty's breach.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of the Agreement:** Dandan argued lack of consent (signing without understanding) and lack of consideration. Successful challenge would release him from the obligation to indemnify Arfel Realty.
*   **Indemnification Amount:** Dandan, if bound, would be liable for the amount Arfel Realty owed the Sauros.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Arfel Realty breached its contract with the Sauros by selling the property to Dandan.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1318, Civil Code:** Requisites of a valid contract: Consent, object, and cause.
*   **Article 1331, Civil Code:** Mistake invalidating consent.
*   **Article 1334, Civil Code:** Mutual error on legal effect of agreement.

*   ***De la Cruz v. De La Cruz***: Notarized document presumption of regularity.
*   ***Lee v. Court of Appeals***: Presumption of understanding a signed document.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Consideration in the Agreement:** Dandan argued there was no consideration. Arfel Realty argued that Dandan's benefit (paying only the balance due from the Sauros) constituted valid consideration. The Court of Appeals agreed with Arfel Realty, finding consideration existed in the reduced purchase price.
*   **Dandan's Consent:** Dandan claims he signed without understanding its legal implications. Arfel Realty claims he was fully aware. The Court of Appeals relied on the language of the Agreement and presumed Dandan understood what he signed.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied Dandan's petition, affirming the Court of Appeals decision, which reinstated the judgment of the HLURB Board of Commissioners. The court found that Dandan had given valid consent and the Agreement was supported by valuable consideration.
