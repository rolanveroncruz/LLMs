## Legal Document Summary: People v. Guerrero, G.R. No. 170360

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Henry Guerrero y Agripa

**Court:** Supreme Court (Second Division)

**Citation:** G.R. No. 170360, March 12, 2009, 600 Phil. 8.

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a conviction for rape.

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant, Henry Guerrero, was found guilty by the RTC of Quezon City for the rape of AAA, a 13-year-old minor. The CA affirmed the RTC decision with modification. The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of the victim, AAA, her mother, and medico-legal evidence. AAA testified that Guerrero, a "kumpadre" of her mother, lured her into his house, removed her clothes, and attempted to penetrate her, causing pain and bleeding. Dr. Freyra's medico-legal report indicated healed hymenal lacerations consistent with penetration by a blunt object. The defense presented alibi, claiming Guerrero was at work during the time of the alleged rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation, or when the victim is deprived of reason, unconscious, under 12, or demented.
*   **Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Prescribes the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to pay civil indemnity (P50,000) and moral damages (P50,000) to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is criminally liable for the crime of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Accused-Appellant is civilly liable for damages to the victim arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Lack of Allegation of Use of Deadly Weapon in Information:** Although evidence presented that the rape involved a weapon, its use was not explicitly alleged in the information. Thus, the court was unable to consider it as a qualifying circumstance leading to a higher penalty.
*   **Alibi Defense:** The defense of alibi was unsuccessful. The close proximity of the crime scene and the place where the Accused-Appellant claimed to be working weakened the alibi.  The court cited People v. Aure, G.R. No. 180451, October 17, 2008.

**Case Law Cited:**

*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 640, 656**: Addresses appellate review of trial court factual findings.
*   **People v. Cabalquinto (G.R. No. 167693, September 19, 2006, 502 SCRA 419)**: Regarding use of initials for rape victims.
*   **People v. Bali-Balita (G.R. No. 134266, September 15, 2000, 340 SCRA 450)**: Defines "carnal knowledge" and the necessary degree of penetration for consummated rape.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. No. 170569, September 30, 2008**: Force or intimidation requirement for rape conviction.
*   **People v. Oliver, G.R. No. 123099, February 11, 1999, 303 SCRA 72**: Sufficiency of force in rape cases.
*   **People v. Aure, G.R. No. 180451, October 17, 2008:**  Requirements for a successful defense of alibi.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**  None identified in this case.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision convicting Guerrero of rape. The court emphasized the victim's credible testimony, corroborated by medical evidence, and rejected the weak defense of alibi. The sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and awards of civil indemnity and moral damages were upheld based on established jurisprudence.
