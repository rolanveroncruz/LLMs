Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Heirs of Sofia Quirong v. Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)*, G.R. No. 173441, December 3, 2009

**Subject Matter:** Prescriptive period for an action of rescission based on eviction.

**Facts:**

*   DBP foreclosed on a property mortgaged to it and consolidated ownership.
*   DBP conditionally sold the property to Sofia Quirong, with a waiver of warranty against eviction and liens.
*   Prior to the sale becoming absolute, the original owners (Dalopes) sued DBP and Funcions (the mortgagor), claiming invalidity of the sale insofar as it prejudiced their shares in the property.
*   The Quirong heirs intervened in the suit to defend the sale to Sofia Quirong, but did not present evidence.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of the Dalopes for 80% of the property, and DBP did not appeal.
*   DBP unsuccessfully challenged the writ of execution up to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 116575).
*   The Quirong heirs then filed an action against DBP for rescission of the sale based on eviction, seeking reimbursement of the purchase price and damages.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the Petition, *affirming* the Court of Appeals decision that dismissed the Quirong heirs' action for rescission based on prescription. The CA held that the 4-year prescriptive period under Article 1389 of the Civil Code barred the Quirong heirs' action for rescission.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Warranty Against Eviction (Article 1548, Civil Code):** The core issue revolves around DBP's potential liability for breach of the implied warranty against eviction, despite the express waiver in the contract of sale. The RTC judgment in the prior case resulted in the eviction of the Quirong heirs from a substantial portion of the purchased property.
*   **Rescission (Article 1191 vs. Article 1381, Civil Code):**  The Court distinguished between "rescission" under Article 1381 (rescissible contracts, subsidiary action) and "resolution" under Article 1191 (reciprocal obligations, based on breach of faith). Actions based on a written contract have a 10 year prescriptive period.
*   **Prescription (Article 1389 and Article 1144, Civil Code):** The Court acknowledged the heirs' claim was styled as a rescission action. While Article 1191 provides a 10 year prescriptive period for resolution of contracts, the prescriptive period for rescission is four years. The Court held the action was governed by the *four-year* prescriptive period of Article 1389. The Court ruled that Art. 1556 in connection with Art. 1389 provided that this action based on subsequent economic loss suffered by the buyer prescribed in four years.
*   **Accrual of Cause of Action:** The prescriptive period began to run on *January 28, 1993*, the date the RTC's decision in the partition case became final and executory when DBP failed to appeal. DBP's subsequent challenge to the writ of execution did not toll the prescriptive period. The court clarified that the Quirong heirs' cause of action stemmed from their having been ousted by final judgment from the ownership of the lot that the DBP sold to Sofia Quirong.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Waiver:** The enforceability of the waiver of warranty against eviction is a crucial element. The Court did not rule on the merits of the waiver.
*   **Formal Offer of Evidence:** It is noted in the ruling that the Quirong heirs' claim was not adjudicated in the previous trial because they failed to make a formal offer of their documentary exhibits.
*   **Application of Rescission vs. Resolution:** While the Court addressed the distinction between rescission and resolution, the framing of the cause of action and the applicability of the respective prescriptive periods could still be argued depending on the specific factual circumstances and the arguments presented in the complaint.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:** Articles 1144, 1191, 1381, 1389, 1548, and 1556 are central to the analysis.

**Summary for Legal Action:**

The case is unfavorable to parties seeking rescission based on eviction after the four-year prescriptive period has lapsed. The Court strictly applies Article 1389 for rescission actions based on eviction, even if the underlying issue involves a breach of contract. Litigation strategy must focus on determining the date the RTC decision became final and executory. Parties relying on warranty waivers should ensure these are clearly drafted and enforceable under the circumstances.
