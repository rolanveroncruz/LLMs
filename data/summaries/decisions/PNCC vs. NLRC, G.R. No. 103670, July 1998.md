**Case Summary: *Philippine National Construction Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Efren Manabo and Ireneo Soriano*, G.R. No. 103670, July 10, 1998**

**Core Issue:** Validity of NLRC decision awarding separation pay to private respondents, previously employed by petitioner, based on a finding of illegal dismissal as regular, not project, employees. The Petitioner alleges that private respondents were hired on a project basis and that no illegal dismissal took place.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employment Status:** The central dispute is whether Efren Manabo and Ireneo Soriano were regular employees or project employees of Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC). The Labor Arbiter initially ruled they were project employees and dismissed the complaints. The NLRC reversed, finding them to be regular employees.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The Supreme Court (SC) found a fundamental flaw: PNCC was denied due process before the NLRC. The NLRC failed to provide notice of private respondents' appeal to PNCC, nor did it solicit comment. This omission is a clear violation of PNCC's constitutional right to be heard on appeal, thus rendering the NLRC decision null and void.
*   **Separation Pay:** NLRC originally granted separation pay to both Efren Manabo and Ireneo Soriano but this was reversed by SC.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PNCC's Obligations:** PNCC's primary asserted obligation was to abide by the terms of project-based employment contracts. The company's failure to assign local project to its repatriated employees was challenged by the respondents.
*   **NLRC's Obligations:** The NLRC has a legal obligation to uphold due process, including providing all parties with notice and opportunity to be heard.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Remand & Re-litigation:** The case is remanded to the NLRC, meaning the litigation continues. PNCC faces the risk of ultimately being found liable for separation pay if the NLRC, after affording due process, still determines that the private respondents were regular employees illegally dismissed.
*   **Establishing Project-Based Employment:** PNCC needs to provide concrete evidence to definitively establish that the employees were specifically hired for particular projects, that those projects had defined durations, and that the employees were aware of this condition at the time of hiring.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Policy Instruction No. 20:** Cited by Petitioner, this instruction addresses the entitlement to separation pay of terminated employee on project basis. This document is highly relevant to the core issue.
*   **Due Process (Constitution):** The SC based its decision on the constitutional guarantee of due process. *Villa v. Lazaro, 189 SCRA 34 (1989)*; *Vigan Electric Light Co., Inc. v. Public Service Commission, L-19850, January 30, 1964*; *Director of Lands v. Santamaria, 44 Phil. 594*; *Luzon Surety Co. v. Marbella, L-16088, September 30, 1960*; *Matute v. CA, L-26751, January 31, 1969*; *Pagdonsalan v. NLRC, 127 SCRA 463 (1984)*; *Mutuc v. Court of Appeals, 190 SCRA 43 (1990)*; *People v. Reyes, 60 SCRA 126 (1974)*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Nature of Employment Contracts:** The terms and conditions of employment, particularly whether the employees were explicitly informed that their employment was project-based, is the fundamental disputed point. This determination will dictate liability.

**Actionable Advice:**
After receiving this case at the NLRC, PNCC should immediately present evidence substantiating the project-based nature of employment, including project contracts, evidence of notice to employees, and any relevant company policies. Additionally, PNCC must scrutinize the basis for calculating the separation pay amount, ensuring its accuracy if liability is ultimately found.
