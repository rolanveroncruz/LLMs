**Legal Document Summary: Producers Bank of the Philippines v. NLRC and Producers Bank Employees Association (G.R. No. 118069, November 16, 1998)**

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld the NLRC's decision that Producers Bank (under conservatorship, now First Philippine International Bank) committed unfair labor practice by failing to implement CBA provisions (retirement plan and uniform allowance) due to the conservator's objection.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **CBA Implementation (Article XI, Section 1 and Article X, Section 4):** Requires the Bank to implement the agreed-upon retirement plan and uniform allowance as stipulated in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
*   **Non-Impairment of Contracts:** Affirms the constitutional principle that valid contracts cannot be unilaterally impaired, even by a bank conservator.
*   **Protection of Labor:** Reinforces the principle that labor's interests are paramount when balanced against capital, warranting sympathetic interpretation of labor laws.
*    Bank under a conservator is still bound by the contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Unfair Labor Practice:** The bank is liable for unfair labor practice for refusing to implement CBA provisions without valid justification.
*   **Financial Obligations:** The bank is obligated to pay retirement benefits and provide uniform allowances as per the CBA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Claims:** Other employees or retirees may file similar claims based on the bank's past refusal to honor CBA provisions.
*   **Penalties/Damages:** While not explicitly stated, further delays or refusal to comply with the order could lead to additional penalties and damages assessed by labor authorities.
* **Conservator interference:** Actions from the conservator cannot overrule CBA agreements.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Central Bank Act (now Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Law):** Section 28-A grants powers to conservators, but the Court clarifies these powers are limited and cannot unilaterally revoke valid contracts.
*   **Labor Code:** Provides for the protection of labor and prohibits unfair labor practices.
*   **Constitution:** Guarantees the non-impairment of contracts and the protection of labor.
*   **Marcopper Mining Corporation v. NLRC, 255 SCRA 322 (1996):** CBA is the law between the contracting parties.
*   **First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals, 252 SCRA 259 (1996):** The conservator's powers are not absolute and cannot impair existing obligations.
*   **Esso Philippines, Inc. v. Malayang Manggagawa sa Esso (MME), 75 SCRA 77 (1977):** A union can sue on behalf of its members to ensure CBA is respected.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of the conservator's powers under the Central Bank Act was contentious. The Court clarifies that those powers do not permit unilateral rescission of valid contracts.
* The court also ruled that because Producers Bank participated in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, it cannot at this stage raise the issue of the Arbiter's lack of jurisdiction.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The ruling establishes that a bank under conservatorship remains bound by its CBA obligations.
*   The conservator's powers are limited by the constitutional principle of non-impairment of contracts.
*   Retired employees retain their status as employees for the purpose of claiming benefits due to them.
*   Estoppel may prevent a party from raising jurisdictional issues if they actively participated in prior proceedings without objection.
