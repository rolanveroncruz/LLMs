## Legal Document Summary: *Joselito R. Mendoza vs. Commission on Elections and Roberto M. Pagdanganan* (G.R. No. 188308, October 15, 2009)

**Core Issue:** Whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in appreciating ballots in an election protest case (EPC No. 2007-44, gubernatorial position of Bulacan) within the premises of the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET) *without notice* to and *participation* of Petitioner Mendoza, after ballot boxes were transferred to the SET for a separate senatorial election protest.

**Ruling:**  Petition for Certiorari *dismissed* for lack of merit. The Supreme Court lifted the Status Quo Order previously issued.

**Key Provisions and Rationale:**

*   **Due Process:**  The Court ruled that the petitioner *was not denied due process.*  The petitioner fully participated in the initial hearing and ballot revision stages. The "proceedings" conducted at the SET were *internal deliberations* by the COMELEC, specifically the appreciation of evidence (ballots) after the case was submitted for resolution, akin to judicial deliberations.  These internal deliberations *do not require notice to or participation by the parties*.
*   **Nature of COMELEC Powers:** The court clarified that the COMELEC is a **constitutional administrative agency** exercising **executive, quasi-judicial, and quasi-legislative powers** *not judicial power*. While adjudicating election protests, the COMELEC does not function as a court in the constitutional sense. Its adjudicative function is quasi-judicial. Therefore, the relevant due process standard is derived from *Ang Tibay v. CIR*, emphasizing opportunity to be heard and reasoned decision-making based on substantial evidence.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The COMELEC **did not lose jurisdiction** over the Bulacan election contest when the ballot boxes were transferred to the SET. The principle of **adherence of jurisdiction** applies. The Constitution vests jurisdiction in COMELEC for provincial official contests and SET for senatorial contests. Both jurisdictions can exist simultaneously without precedence.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure (Section 4):** The COMELEC action of deliberating in the SET premises, even though there is no *specific* rule permitting it, is justified under Section 4 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure (similar to Rule 136, Section 6 of the Rules of Court for courts), which allows the Commission to employ suitable processes to effect its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court found that the COMELEC action was not an illegal proceeding that would bear "poisonous fruits". The COMELEC's action was a valid exercise of discretion aimed at expediting the disposition of the case.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 2812:**  The Court emphasized that the coordination between COMELEC and SET was envisioned in COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 which dictates a preferential order for the custody of ballots, without precluding either the Senate Electoral Tribunal or COMELEC from disposing of their respective protests, and that said coordination was honored by the SET Secretary. The arrangement recognized the COMELEC’s effective authority over the Bulacan ballots.
*   **Separation of Powers:**  The COMELEC's actions did *not* violate the principle of separation of powers, as both tribunals operated within their respective jurisdictions.
*   **Alleged Rule-Making Intrusions:** The Second Division did not intrude on the COMELEC en banc’s rule-making prerogative when it chose to undertake ballot appreciation within the SET premises. The Second Division never laid down any new rule, it merely acted pursuant to a rule that the COMELEC en banc itself had previously enacted.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Confidentiality of Deliberations:** The Court heavily relies on the confidential nature of internal deliberations to justify the lack of notice. This might raise concerns about transparency and potential for abuse, even if unintentional, especially when such deliberations occur outside the COMELEC's usual premises.
*   **Broad Interpretation of Section 4, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** The Court interprets Section 4 broadly to allow the COMELEC to take actions not explicitly covered by existing rules. This broad interpretation might be challenged in future cases if it leads to actions that appear unfair or prejudicial to the parties involved.
*   **Practical Application of COMELEC Resolution No. 2812:** The Court mentioned COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 on the coordination between COMELEC and SET was honored by the SET Secretary, but its practical application in cases where interests conflict remains unclear.
*   **Timing:** The court did not give credence to the petitioner's argument that the petition was filed beyond the reglementary period provided under Rule 64.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations:** Establishes the cardinal primary rights in administrative proceedings, defining the due process requirements for administrative agencies.
*   **Quintos v. Commission on Elections:** Defines grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Section 1, Article VIII, 1987 Constitution:** Vests judicial power in the Supreme Court and lower courts.
*   **Section 2, Article IX(C), 1987 Constitution:** Lists COMELEC's powers and functions.
*   **Section 4, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Allows COMELEC to employ auxiliary means to effect its jurisdiction.
*   **Section 6, Rule 136, Rules of Court:** Similar provision for courts to carry their jurisdiction into effect.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 2812.**

**Recommendations:**

*   Monitor future cases to see how courts interpret and apply Section 4 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   Consider whether stricter guidelines regarding deliberation procedures, particularly when conducted outside COMELEC premises, are needed to ensure transparency and fairness.
*   Analyze the potential conflicts that may arise between the Senate Electoral Tribunal and COMELEC under COMELEC Resolution No. 2812 and recommend possible solutions.
