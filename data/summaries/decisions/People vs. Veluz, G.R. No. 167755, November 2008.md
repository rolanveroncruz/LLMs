Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document for a lawyer:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Nestor Veluz*, G.R. No. 167755, November 28, 2008 (593 Phil. 145)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for rape of a minor mental retardate.  The RTC and CA found the accused, Veluz, guilty of rape under Article 266-A, par. 1(d) and punished under Article 266-B (10) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Veluz was accused of raping AAA, a 13-year-old girl with a mental age of 4-5 years old. The prosecution presented witnesses including AAA, an eyewitness (Rivera), and medical and psychological experts.  AAA testified about the rape. Rivera testified she witnessed the act. The defense presented Veluz and his daughter who provided alibi testimony. The RTC convicted Veluz, and the CA affirmed with modification to damages.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Article 266-A, par. 1(d) and Article 266-B (10), Revised Penal Code:** Defines and punishes rape. The key issue is whether the prosecution proved carnal knowledge and the accused's knowledge of the victim's mental disability. The defense challenged the credibility of the witnesses, particularly AAA and Rivera, alleging inconsistencies in their testimonies.
*   **Mental Disability as a Qualifying Circumstance:** Article 266-B(10) elevates the penalty when the offender knew of the victim's mental disability. The defense argued the prosecution failed to adequately prove AAA's mental retardation according to established standards. The Court cited *People v. Acero*, 469 Phil. 686 (2004), to support the argument that the trial court could consider a victim's demeanor and comportment and a psychologist was used as an expert witness.
*   **Credibility of Testimony:** The defense attacked the credibility of AAA's testimony, characterizing it as a "standard and stereotypical narration of rape." The Court emphasized the deference given to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, citing *People of the Philippines v. Navida*, 400 Phil. 684, 696 (2000). The court also addressed arguments about inconsistencies between witness testimonies, citing precedent that victim recollections will not always be error-free.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The defense argued the lack of physical evidence (fresh hymenal lacerations or injuries) negated AAA's claim of rape. The Court reiterated that proof of hymenal laceration is not an essential element of rape and highlighted the testimony from Dr. Eligio that old lacerations were observed, and that the penis of the rapist may not have been large enough to inflict new injuries.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346 (Prohibition of Death Penalty):** Although the RTC and CA initially imposed the death penalty, the Supreme Court reduced the penalty to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole due to R.A. 9346.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Veluz):** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape, sentenced to reclusion perpetua and ordered to pay civil indemnity (P75,000), moral damages (P75,000), and exemplary damages (P25,000).
*   **State:** Had the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Subjective Observation:**  The court's reliance on the trial court's observation of AAA's demeanor to establish mental retardation, while supported by *People v. Acero*, could be viewed as potentially problematic if not supported by robust clinical evidence.
*   **Assessment of Credibility:** The defense raised legitimate arguments about the credibility and consistency of witness testimonies. While the court applied established legal principles, the reliance on these testimonies remains a potential point of contention.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Articles 266-A and 266-B
*   Republic Act No. 9346: An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines
*   People v. Acero, 469 Phil. 686 (2004): Mental retardation can be proved by evidence other than clinical evidence
*   People v. Navida, 400 Phil. 684, 696 (2000): Trial Court is best positioned to determine witness credibility

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty due to the prohibition of the death penalty. The key legal issues revolved around the credibility of witnesses and the sufficiency of evidence to prove both the rape and the accused's knowledge of the victim's mental disability.
