**Case Summary: Madrid v. Mapoy, G.R. No. 150887 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision in an *accion publiciana* case.

**Key Issue:** Better right of possession to two parcels of land, where respondents (Mapoys) claim ownership based on TCTs, and petitioners (Madrid & Bernardo) claim possessory rights through predecessors and protection under P.D. 1517 (Urban Land Reform Law).

**Facts:**

*   Mapoys (plaintiffs) hold TCTs for the properties. They filed an *accion publiciana* to recover possession from the Mirandas, Madrid, and Bernardo (defendants).
*   Defendants claim ownership through an oral sale to Gregorio Miranda from the original owner (Antonio) and subsequent transfers. Bernardo asserts a direct oral sale from Antonio. Madrid claims occupancy with permission from Bernardo.
*   Defendants also invoke Section 6 of P.D. 1517, claiming they are legitimate tenants who have occupied the land for 10+ years.
*   RTC ruled for Mapoys, ordering defendants to vacate and pay rent & attorney's fees. CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   ***Accion Publiciana & Ownership:** Court reiterates that accion publiciana determines better right of possession, but courts may provisionally resolve ownership claims to settle possession. Such adjudication is not binding on title in a subsequent action.*
*   ***Title Indefeasibility:** Court emphasized TCTs as evidence of indefeasible title, entitling owners to possession (Article 428, Civil Code; *Baloloy v. Hular, G.R. No. 157767*).
*   ***Collateral Attack:** The Court deemed the petitioners' challenge to the validity of the respondents' title based on fraud a prohibited collateral attack (*Herce, Jr. v. Municipality of Cabuyao, Laguna, G.R. No. 166645*).  The attack was incidental to defending possession, not a direct action to annul the title.
*   ***PD 1517:** To qualify for protection under P.D. 1517, an individual must be a legitimate tenant for 10+ years, have built a home on the land by contract, and resided continuously for the past 10 years. Those whose possession is merely tolerated by the owner are *not* legitimate tenants under the law and, therefore, lack legal authority to be protected by P.D. 1517 (*Delos Santos v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127465*).
*   ***Pre-Trial Order:** The court ruled that the delayed summons service of the petitioners-defendants and their subsequent lack of a pre-trial did not render the proceedings void. The court stated that the petitioners-defendants forfeited their right to a pre-trial by not raising the matter to the attention of the RTC. *Martinez v. de la Merced, G.R. No. 82039*
*   ***Attorney's Fees:** The Court *sua sponte* deleted the RTC's award of attorney's fees, noting that the award was included only in the dispositive portion without any justification or explanation in the body of the decision (*Spouses Samatra v. Vda. de Pari√±as, 431 Phil. 255*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners ordered to vacate the premises and pay reasonable rent from the filing of the complaint until they vacate.
*   Respondents are entitled to possession as registered owners.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collateral Attack:**  Petitioners' continued assertion of ownership based on an oral sale may be deemed a collateral attack on the TCT, which is disfavored and likely to fail without a direct action to annul the title.
*   **PD 1517 Inapplicability:** Petitioners' reliance on P.D. 1517 will likely be unsuccessful due to their lack of legal standing as legitimate tenants. The definition of "tenant" explicitly excludes those whose presence is merely tolerated and without the benefit of contract, rendering them ineligible for protection under P.D. 1517.
*   **Eviction:** Petitioners face a high risk of eviction from the property.
*   **Monetary Damages:** Petitioners may be obligated to pay past rent, even though attorney's fees have been deleted.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The fact that the RTC ordered payment of rent from the filing of the complaint, *potentially* implying no prior claim for unpaid rent during the tolerated period.
