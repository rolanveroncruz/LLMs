**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Gina P. Tecag*, G.R. No. 229272, November 19, 2018 (843 Phil. 447)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision that affirmed the RTC's grant of a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Facts:**

*   Gina and Marjune married in 2006. Gina worked abroad and sent money for Marjune, which he used for farming instead of joining her. Communication deteriorated, and Gina discovered Marjune was having an affair.
*   Gina filed for nullity based on Marjune's psychological incapacity. Marjune did not answer the summons.
*   Gina presented a psychologist, Professor Sanchez, who interviewed Gina, her sister, and her brother-in-law. Professor Sanchez diagnosed Gina with "Anxious and Fearful Personality Disorder" with traits of "Dependent Personality Disorder", and Marjune with "Avoidant Personality Disorder" based only on the interview with the other parties involved.
*   The RTC granted the petition, finding both parties psychologically incapacitated. The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Ground for nullity based on psychological incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations.
*   **Essential Marital Obligations (Article 68, Family Code):** Mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect, fidelity, render help and support.
*   **Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the dissolution of marriage based on psychological incapacity.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA decision, denying the petition for nullity.
*   The Court reiterated the strict interpretation of "psychological incapacity" as requiring grave, serious, and incurable personality disorders that render a party *utterly* incapable of understanding and fulfilling marital obligations. This standard is derived from *Republic v. CA* (335 Phil. 664 (1997)) and subsequent cases.
*   The psychological incapacity must have juridical antecedence (rooted in the party's history antedating the marriage) and be incurable (or curable only beyond the party's means). See *Lontoc-Cruz v. Cruz* (G.R. No. 201988, October 11, 2017).
*   The Court found that the expert testimony of Prof. Sanchez, while presented, was insufficient:
    *   Failed to adequately demonstrate that Gina's alleged personality disorder existed before the marriage or that it was incurable.
    *   Failed to establish a clear causal link between Gina's condition and her inability to perform essential marital obligations. The court emphasized that the testimony of the expert does not lie in the mere statement of the theory but the facts that serve as the basis for the criterion
    *   Marjune's diagnosis was based solely on Gina's account, raising concerns about bias, and not on actual examination of the respondent.
    *   Marjune's actions, like sexual infidelity, were deemed insufficient *per se* to establish psychological incapacity without proving these actions were manifestations of a disordered personality rendering him incapable of fulfilling his marital obligations (citing *Navales v. Navales*, 578 Phil. 827 (2008)).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Parties have the obligation to prove psychological incapacity with clear and convincing evidence.
*   Expert witnesses have the obligation to clearly identify the psychological illness and fully explain the incapacitating nature of it.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Reliance on biased sources for psychological assessments (Gina's account of Marjune's behavior).
*   Generalization of infidelity as *ipso facto* evidence of psychological incapacity.
*   The ruling highlights that difficulty, refusal, or neglect to perform marital obligations is not synonymous with the severe and ingrained incapacity required under Article 36.
*   Over-reliance on expert testimony without independent corroboration and failure to establish juridical antecedence and incurability.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Psychological incapacity as a ground for nullity.
*   **Article 68, Family Code:** Essential marital obligations.
*   ***Republic v. CA*** (335 Phil. 664 (1997)): Established guidelines for psychological incapacity.
*   ***Lontoc-Cruz v. Cruz*** (G.R. No. 201988, October 11, 2017): Reiterated the requirements of gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.
*   ***Navales v. Navales*** (578 Phil. 827 (2008)): Sexual infidelity alone is insufficient for a finding of psychological incapacity.
*   ***Toring v. Toring*** (640 Phil. 434 (2010)): Irreconcilable differences, sexual infidelity, emotional immaturity are not automatically psychological incapacity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of "psychological incapacity" remain contentious due to the subjective nature of psychological evaluations and the potential for abuse as a de facto divorce. The Court consistently emphasizes the need for a stringent standard to protect the institution of marriage.
