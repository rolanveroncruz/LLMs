**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-08-2567 & A.M. No. P-08-2568**

**Nature:**  Consolidated administrative cases against Nicolasito S. Solas, Clerk of Court IV, MTCC, Iloilo City, initiated by multiple court employees.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Unauthorized Notarization:** Solas notarized documents unrelated to his official duties and collected fees, violating Section 41 of the Administrative Code of 1987 (RA 6733).  *Astorga v. Solas, 413 Phil. 558 (2001)* is cited regarding the limitations on a clerk's *ex-officio* notarial powers.
*   **Acts Unbecoming a Court Employee (Simple Misconduct):**  Allegations of arrogance, abuse of authority, humiliation of subordinates, and use of offensive language. Violates the standard of propriety and decorum expected of court employees. *Villaros v. Orpiano, 459 Phil. 1 (2003)* is cited.
*   **Other Allegations:** Harassment, graft, corruption, oppression, nepotism, and making false claims to be an attorney.  These were not substantiated by the evidence.

**Respondent's Defenses:**

*   Regarding notarization, he claimed he mistook oaths for jurats and consulted the IBP and RTC Judge.  This was rejected by the court due to his status as a law graduate, as it means the court does not accept "ignorance of the law" as a legitimate defense.
*   Claimed complainants were instigated to file complaints against him.
*   Denied abuse of power.
*   Claims of counter-charges filed against complainants Leyrit and Mrs. Zerrudo.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Guilty of Simple Misconduct:** For failing to conduct himself with propriety and moral righteousness in dealing with subordinates. Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Fernandez, 480 Phil. 495 (2004) defines Misconduct.
*   **Liable for Unauthorized Notarization:** In violation of Sec. 41 of Administrative Code of 1987.
*   **Penalty:**  Fine equivalent to three months' salary, to be deducted from retirement benefits (since he retired during the investigation). This is in line with Section 52, B(2), Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
*   **Double Jeopardy Issue:** Because he had previously been penalized in A.M. No. P-01-1484 for similar notarial services rendered in excess of his authority, the imposition of another penalty upon him for exactly the same charge is inappropriate, as it will constitute double penalty.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Respondent is obligated to pay the fine.
*   Respondent is now under administrative sanctions for misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy Argument:** The court acknowledged a prior penalty for similar conduct, mitigating a potentially harsher penalty.
*   **Subjectivity of Misconduct:**  The finding of simple misconduct hinges on subjective assessments of demeanor and interaction with subordinates.  Proof requires a preponderance of evidence.
*   **Lack of Substantiation:**  The dismissal of other allegations highlights the importance of providing substantial evidence in administrative cases.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 41, Administrative Code of 1987 (RA 6733):**  Governs authority to administer oaths.
*   **Section 52, B(2), Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Governs penalties for misconduct.
*   *Astorga v. Solas, 413 Phil. 558 (2001):*  Limits on a clerk's ex-officio notarial powers.
*   *Villaros v. Orpiano, 459 Phil. 1 (2003):*  Standard of propriety and decorum for court employees.
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Fernandez, 480 Phil. 495 (2004):* Defines Misconduct.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of what constitutes "unbecoming" conduct is inherently fact-specific and potentially subject to differing interpretations. The court relied heavily on witness testimony.
