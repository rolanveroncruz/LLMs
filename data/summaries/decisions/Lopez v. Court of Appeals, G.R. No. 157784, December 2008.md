## Legal Document Summary: *Lopez v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 157784)

**Case:** *Richard B. Lopez, Trustee of the Estate of Juliana Lopez-Manzano, v. Court of Appeals, et al.*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's summary judgment dismissing the action for reconveyance based on prescription.

**Key Issue:** Whether the action for reconveyance of disputed properties has prescribed. This depends on whether the registration of properties by Jose Lopez-Manzano in his name constituted an express or implied trust.

**Facts:**

*   Juliana Lopez-Manzano (Juliana) executed a will establishing a trust (Fideicomiso) over her paraphernal properties, with her husband, Jose Lopez-Manzano (Jose), as trustee.
*   The will was probated and Jose acted as executor.
*   Jose submitted a Project of Partition, classifying some properties as conjugal (including the disputed properties), and others as paraphernal to be part of the Fideicomiso. The disputed properties are located in Balayan, Batangas.
*   The Probate Court approved the Project of Partition, adjudicating the "conjugal" properties (including the disputed ones) to Jose as his share and inheritance, and explicitly excluding them from the Fideicomiso.
*   Certificates of Title (TCTs) for the disputed properties were issued in Jose's name on September 15, 1969.
*   Jose later died, bequeathing the disputed properties to the respondents. TCTs were subsequently issued in the respondents' names.
*   The Petitioner, as the new trustee, filed an action for reconveyance, claiming the disputed properties belonged to the Fideicomiso and were erroneously registered in Jose's name.

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) *denied* the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision. The reconveyance action had prescribed.

**Key Provisions and Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Implied vs. Express Trust:** The SC ruled that an *implied trust* (specifically a *constructive trust*) arose, *not* an express trust. While Juliana intended an express trust, the disputed properties were expressly excluded from the Fideicomiso by the Probate Court's order.
*   **Constructive Trust (Art. 1456, Civil Code):** If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the acquirer is considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes.
*   **Prescription (Civil Code):** Actions based on implied or constructive trusts prescribe in *10 years*.
*   **Commencement of Prescriptive Period:** The SC held that the prescriptive period began *on September 15, 1969*, when the TCTs for the disputed properties were issued in Jose's name. This constituted *constructive notice* to the world of Jose's adverse claim.
*   **Repudiation Not Required for Constructive Trusts:** The SC distinguished between express/resulting trusts (where repudiation is required to trigger prescription) and constructive trusts (where it is not). Even though Jose was initially the trustee, the exclusion of the disputed property from the Fideicomiso and the issuance of TCTs to him served as a sufficient indication of adverse claim to trigger the prescriptive period. The act of including properties as conjugal in the project partition is an act of repudiation of any trust obligation.

*   *Heirs of Yap v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 133047) - Defines Implied Trusts.

*  Vda. de Esconde v. Court of Appeals (253 SCRA 66) - Reiterates that in constructive implied trusts, prescription may supervene even if the trustee does not repudiate the relationship.

**Potential Risks and Issues:**

*   **Collateral Attack:** Petitioner effectively attempts to collaterally attack the Probate Court's order approving the Project of Partition and adjudicating the property to Jose.
*   **Laches:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the delay in filing the reconveyance action (15 years after the issuance of titles to Jose) could be raised.
*   **Ambiguity in the Will:** The language of Juliana's will could be subject to interpretation regarding the scope of the Fideicomiso.
*   **Notice:** Arguably, beneficiaries may not have had actual notice of the contents of the project of partition during the probate proceedings.

**Conclusion:**

The SC found that the action for reconveyance was barred by prescription. The registration of the disputed properties in Jose's name on September 15, 1969, created a constructive trust and triggered the 10-year prescriptive period for filing an action to recover the properties. This case emphasizes the importance of timely action in asserting rights over property held in trust and the distinction between express and implied trusts in determining the applicable rules on prescription.
