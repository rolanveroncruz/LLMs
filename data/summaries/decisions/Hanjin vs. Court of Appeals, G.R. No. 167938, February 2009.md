Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided *Hanjin Heavy Industries vs. Court of Appeals* case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Company Ltd. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 167938, February 19, 2009.

**Summary:**

Hanjin (Petitioner) seeks to nullify the Court of Appeals (CA) decision that found it liable for the illegal dismissal of Lauro Ramos (Private Respondent), an overseas worker deployed through Multiline Resources Corporation.  The CA modified the NLRC resolution, awarding Ramos a full year's salary.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** Ramos was hired through Multiline for employment with Hanjin in Saudi Arabia as a barber with a 12-month contract.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Upon arrival, Ramos was informed that his position was filled, and he was effectively stranded. He returned to the Philippines after five days and filed a complaint.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   POEA initially ruled in favor of Ramos.
    *   NLRC initially denied Multiline's appeal, then set aside the POEA decision due to jurisdictional issues raised by RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act), forwarding the case to a Labor Arbiter.
    *   Labor Arbiter dismissed the case for non-appearance, then dismissed it again without prejudice.
    *   Ramos re-filed; Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint.
    *   NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter and found Hanjin liable, awarding 3 months salary, moral damages, and attorney's fees.
    *   Ramos appealed to the CA, seeking a full year's salary.
    *   CA granted Ramos' petition for one year salary. Hanjin did not appeal the illegal dismissal ruling and appealed to the Supreme Court.
*   **Hanjin's Arguments:**
    1.  CA erred by not furnishing a copy of the petition to Hanjin's counsel.
    2.  No employer-employee relationship existed between Hanjin and Ramos.
    3.  Dismissal (assuming one existed) was valid.
    4.  CA erred in awarding a full year's salary instead of three months.
    5.  No basis for moral damages.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed Hanjin's petition. The CA decision was affirmed.

**Key Legal Issues and Reasoning:**

*   **Procedural Error:** The SC stated that Hanjin should have filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, not a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65. Certiorari is inappropriate when an appeal is available.
*   **Finality of NLRC Decision:** Hanjin's failure to appeal the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal rendered that finding final.  *Asuncion v. National Labor Relations Commission* establishes that perfecting an appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.
*   **Mode of Appeal:** The SC cited Circular No. 2-90, stating that an appeal by the wrong mode shall be dismissed.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC held that Hanjin was challenging errors of judgment, not jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion, making certiorari improper. *VMC Rural Electric Service Cooperative, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* establishes that certiorari is inappropriate if challenging the wisdom of a decision. *Danzas Corporation v. Abrogar* cited to emphasize the same point.
*   **Untimeliness & Lack of Merit:** The petition could not be treated as one filed under Rule 45 because it was filed late and lacked merit.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Hanjin is liable for Ramos's full year salary.
*   Hanjin is liable for moral damages and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The SC did not explicitly rule on the existence of an employer-employee relationship between Hanjin and Ramos. Hanjin's failure to appeal the lower court finding prevented the Court from considering the issue.
*   **RA 8042:** While RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act) is cited, its specific provisions regarding compensation for illegal dismissal are not analyzed in depth.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The POEA decision initially ordered Multiline *jointly and severally* liable. It's unclear if this liability remains.

**Key Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Correct mode of appeal.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari, not a substitute for appeal.
*   **R.A. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):** Relates to the rights and remedies of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs).
*   *Asuncion v. National Labor Relations Commission*, G.R. No. 109311: Perfection of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.
*   *Davao Merchant Marine Academy v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 144075: Certiorari cannot be made a substitute for the lost remedy of appeal under Rule 45.
*   *VMC Rural Electric Service Cooperative, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 153144: Certiorari is inappropriate if challenging the wisdom of a decision.
*   *Danzas Corporation v. Abrogar*, G.R. No. 141462: Highlights the distinction between errors of judgment and errors of jurisdiction in the context of certiorari.
*   *Hanjin Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 165910: Sets out limited circumstances when a Rule 65 petition can be treated as a Rule 45 petition.
