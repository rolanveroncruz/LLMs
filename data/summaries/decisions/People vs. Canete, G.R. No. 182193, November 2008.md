## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Canete*, G.R. No. 182193

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for six counts of simple rape.

**Key Provisions & Holding:**

*   Accused-Appellant (Canete), the victim's uncle, was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of six counts of simple rape based on the positive and consistent testimony of the victim (AAA).
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision upholding the RTC’s conviction.
*   The victim's testimony, despite being the sole witness, was deemed credible. The court stated that rape is not a respecter of people, time, or place.
*   Accused-appellant's defense of alibi and the alleged improbability of the rapes occurring due to the presence of other people in the vicinity were rejected. The Court pointed out that the moral ascendancy of the accused over the victim, her uncle, was enough to ensure submission.
*   The Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals that that the award of exemplary damages must be deleted in view of the absence of the qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused-Appellant is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each of the six counts of simple rape.
*   Accused-Appellant is liable to pay the victim civil indemnity *ex delicto* of P50,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00 for each count.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Qualifying Circumstances:** The information failed to explicitly allege the qualifying circumstances of minority of the victim at the time of the commission of the crime and relationship between the accused and the victim (uncle). This resulted in the downgrading of the crime to simple rape and the deletion of exemplary damages. This highlights the importance of precise and comprehensive drafting of indictments.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-B:** Defines and penalizes simple rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, invoked to protect the privacy of the victim.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** N/A - The ambiguity lies in the initial charging documents, specifically the Informations, which lacked crucial qualifying details.
