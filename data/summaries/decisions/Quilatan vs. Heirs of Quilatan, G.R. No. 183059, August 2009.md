Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Quilatan v. Heirs of Quilatan*, G.R. No. 183059, August 28, 2009:

**Case Summary: *Quilatan v. Heirs of Quilatan*, G.R. No. 183059, August 28, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' reversal of the RTC decision in a case for nullification of tax declarations, partition of estate, and damages.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) correctly reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision for failure to implead all indispensable parties in an action for partition.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, holding that the failure to implead all indispensable parties (specifically, all heirs of Pedro Quilatan's children: Ciriaco, Francisco, and Lorenzo) in an action for partition renders the trial court's judgment null and void for lack of jurisdiction.  The case was remanded to the trial court for impleadment of indispensable parties.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 69, Section 1 (Partition):**  Requires a plaintiff seeking partition to join as defendants "all the other persons interested in the property."
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Section 7 (Compulsory Joinder):** Mandates joinder of "parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action."
*   **Plaintiff's Obligation:** The responsibility of impleading all indispensable parties rests on the petitioner/plaintiff.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Failure to implead indispensable parties deprives the court of jurisdiction, rendering any judgment void *ab initio* (from the beginning).
*   **Nullity of Judgment:**  A judgment rendered without jurisdiction is not binding even on those parties who were present (citing *Commissioner Andrea D. Domingo v. Herbert Markus Emil Scheer* and *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Hon. Floro T. Alejo*).
*   **Multiplicity of Suits:** While the petitioners argued that dismissal and refiling would lead to multiplicity of suits, the court found that the lack of jurisdiction necessitates this outcome.
*   **Res Judicata/Bar by Prior Judgment:** A judgment in partition is not binding on those not party to the proceedings

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 69, Section 1:** Action for partition of real estate.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 3, Section 7:** Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties.

*   ***Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Hon. Floro T. Alejo***: A valid judgment cannot be rendered where there is a want of indispensable parties

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The argument of petitioners regarding the prevention of multiplicity of suits was rejected, but the Court suggested that the original issue could have been avoided had the indispensable parties been joined initially.
*   Respondents were not blamed for failing to raise this issue in their Answer, as it's the plaintiffs burden to ensure all parties were impleaded.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The refiled case must ensure *all* indispensable parties are properly impleaded, or the new judgment will be similarly vulnerable.
*   Statute of limitations might become a concern if refiling is delayed considerably.
*   Determining heirship, if complex, could prolong the proceedings.
