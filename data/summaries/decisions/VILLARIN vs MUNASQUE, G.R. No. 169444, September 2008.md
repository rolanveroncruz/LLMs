## Legal Document Summary: *Villarin v. Munasque* (G.R. No. 169444)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision reversing the RTC order that nullified an execution sale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** Petitioners acknowledged a joint and solidary debt of P15 million to Respondent, secured by real estate mortgages originally in favor of Intra Strata (assigned to Respondent).
*   **Writ of Execution:**  Issued after Petitioners defaulted on the Compromise Agreement. Deputy Sheriff levied on 44 parcels of land.
*   **Auction Sale:** Conducted by the Deputy Sheriff, with Respondent being the sole bidder.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners: Joint and solidary obligation to pay P15 million plus interest.
*   Deputy Sheriff:  Enforcement of the Writ of Execution under Rule 39, Section 9 of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Procedural Defects in Execution:**
    *   **Failure to Demand Immediate Payment:** Petitioners argued the Deputy Sheriff failed to demand immediate payment in cash before levying, violating Rule 39, Section 9.
    *   **Failure to Allow Option to Choose Properties:** Petitioners claimed they were not given the option to choose which properties to levy.
    *   **Improper Levy on Real Property Before Personal Property:**  Petitioners contend the sheriff should have attempted to levy on their personal properties first.

*   **Alleged Overlevy:** Petitioners argued that the value of the properties levied exceeded the debt, constituting an overlevy, and that the CA ignored their evidence of market value.

*   **Alleged Bulk Sale:** Petitioners claimed the 44 parcels were sold in bulk instead of individually, violating execution sale procedure.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 9, Rules of Court:**  Governs the execution of judgments for money, including the requirement for demand of payment, option to choose property, and order of property levied. The core dispute revolves around the sheriff's compliance with this rule.
*   **Article 6 of the New Civil Code:**  Cited by the CA regarding the waivability of rights.
*   ***Seven Brothers Shipping Corp. v. Oriental Assurance Corp.*:** Discusses the necessity of strict adherence to the rules of procedure in executing monetary claims.
*   ***Torres v. Cabling***: Affirms that a sheriff is not required to give the judgment debtor some time to raise cash for the debt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Waiver of Procedural Requirements:** Respondent argued Petitioners' actions (through counsel) constituted a waiver of the demand for immediate payment and the option to choose properties.  The validity and scope of this waiver is a central issue.

*   **Evidence of Fair Market Value:**  The admissibility and probative value of the Petitioners' evidence regarding the market value of the levied properties.  The Court found the photocopies and lack of specific property identification problematic.

**Summary of Court's Holding:**
The Supreme Court denied the petition. The court deemed the failure of the sheriff to demand immediate payment in cash as valid due to the admissions of the Petitioners counsel, which was a waiver of their right to demand immediate payment. The court also held that the properties were sold individually and not in bulk.
