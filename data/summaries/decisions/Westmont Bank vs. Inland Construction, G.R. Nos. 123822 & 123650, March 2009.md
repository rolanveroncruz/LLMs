## Legal Document Summary: *Westmont Bank vs. Inland Construction and Development Corp.* (G.R. No. 123650 & 123822)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review assailing the Court of Appeals decision in a case involving foreclosure of real estate mortgages, a Deed of Assignment, and alleged ratification by the bank.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Inland executed real estate mortgages over three properties to secure loans from Westmont Bank (formerly Associated Citizens Bank).
*   **Promissory Notes:** Inland issued several promissory notes to the bank.
*   **Deed of Assignment (May 2, 1978 & May 26, 1978):** Inland's President assigned his rights in Hanil-Gonzales to Abrantes, who assumed Inland's obligation under Promissory Note BD-2884-77. An account officer of the bank, Lionel Calo Jr. (Calo) signed for the bank's conformity to the Deed. The parties agreed to seek the conformity of Associated Citizens Bank to this new arrangement for the full liquidation of said account.
*   **Loan Restructuring:** Hanil-Gonzales requested and received approval for loan restructuring, which included Inland's obligation.
*   **Bank's Obligation:** To exercise a high degree of diligence when evaluating the restructuring request and to fastidiously scrutinize the loan account of Inland.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **Inland:** Initially liable for loans secured by real estate mortgages. CA ruled it remains liable for P186,241.86 on promissory notes not covered by the Deed of Assignment.
*   **Westmont Bank:** Found to have ratified the Deed of Assignment despite Calo's alleged lack of authority. Bank held to the confirmation by Lionel Calo Jr. and agreement to restructure by the Executive Committee.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Calo's Authority:** Whether Calo had actual or apparent authority to bind the bank. The dissenting opinion emphasizes that Inland had the burden of proving Calo's authority, which it failed to do.
*   **Ratification:** Whether the bank ratified the Deed of Assignment by approving Hanil-Gonzales' loan restructuring. The dissent argues the lack of express release of Inland, and no agreement, by way of novation, to have Hanil-Gonzales be substituted in Inland's place.
*   **Novation:** Whether the Deed of Assignment constituted a valid novation, substituting Hanil-Gonzales as the new debtor. Dissenting opinion argues there was no express consent or intent to release Inland.
*   **Foreclosure:** While foreclosure on the assigned debt (PN# BD-2884-77) is barred, CA allows foreclosure based on other unpaid debts. Extent of continued liability of original debtor Inland after the assumption of debt and subsequent ratification by bank, is not fully explored.
*   **Evidentiary Standard:** Whether Inland met the evidentiary burden to prove the bank clothed Calo with apparent authority before the burden shifted to the bank to prove Calo was unauthorized.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Doctrine of Apparent Authority:** Principal bound by agent's actions if they consciously allowed the agent to act within apparent authority. *People's Aircargo and Warehousing Co. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117847, October 7, 1998, 297 SCRA 170, 184-185 citing Francisco v. GSIS, 7 SCRA 577, 583 (1963).*
*   **Yao Ka Sin Trading v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 53820, June 15, 1992, 209 SCRA 763.):**  Establishes burden shifting for proving corporate officer authority. This shifts the burden to the third party after the corporation shows the officer lacked authority.
*   **Westmont Bank v. Pronstroller (G.R. No. 148444, July 14, 2008):** Illustrates a similar case where Westmont Bank proved the officer's actions were rejected, requiring the other party to prove apparent authority.
*   **Premium Marble Resources v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 96551, 264 SCRA 11, 18 citing Visayan v. NLRC, G.R. No. 69999, April 30, 1991, 196 SCRA 410):** Affirms the requirement of Board of Directors approval to bind the corporation.
*   **Article 1293, Civil Code:** Outlines the requirements for novation by substitution of the debtor, requiring consent of the creditor.
*   **Ajax Marketing and Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 118585, September 14, 1995, 248 SCRA 223.):** To effect a subjective novation by a change in the person of the debtor, it is necessary that the old debtor be released expressly from the obligation, and the third person or new debtor assumes his place in the relation.

**Dissenting Opinion Highlights:**

*   Burden of proof misallocation: Inland failed to prove Calo's authority.
*   Insufficient evidence of ratification.
*   Lack of valid novation.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision, affirming Westmont Bank's ratification of the Deed of Assignment and allowing foreclosure only based on other debts.
