## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bulutano*, G.R. No. 232649 (2018)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Mario Bulutano for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, stemming from the death of Wilbert Augusto following a brawl.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Bulutano, along with others, was accused of fatally striking Wilbert Augusto with wooden clubs with intent to kill, treachery, evident premeditation, and superior strength.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Bulutano and others rushed towards a brawl, armed with weapons. Serad initially hit Wilbert, and then Bulutano struck him in the head while he was already on the ground.
*   **Defense's Version:** Bulutano denied participation, claiming Serad acted alone and that Bulutano only attempted to pacify the brawl after happening upon it by chance.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Bulutano guilty of Murder based on eyewitness testimony and the presence of treachery (hitting a defenseless victim).
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's conviction for murder, upholding the RTC's assessment of witness credibility and the presence of treachery. Modified the awarded damages to conform to recent jurisprudence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Initially, Bulutano was obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil indemnity (₱50,000), exemplary damages (₱100,000), moral damages (₱100,000), and temperate damages (₱25,000).
*   The Supreme Court *reduced* the conviction to Homicide. Consequently, Bulutano is obligated to serve an indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*. Additionally, Bulutano is obligated to pay civil indemnity (₱50,000), moral damages (₱50,000), and temperate damages (₱50,000) to the heirs of Wilbert Augusto.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Treachery:** The primary point of contention. The CA affirmed the RTC's finding that Bulutano’s actions constituted treachery because the victim was already defenseless. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned this finding.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses based on alleged inconsistencies and a possible basketball rivalry.
*   **Chain of Events:** The sequence of events leading to the attack, especially the initial brawl and the victim's involvement, impacts the assessment of intent and premeditation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Article 249, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes homicide.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied by the Supreme Court in modifying the sentence for Homicide.
*   **People v. Santos, 175 Phil. 113 (1978):** Clarifies that treachery must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, not presumed.
*   **People v. Calinawan, 83 Phil. 647 (1949):** Addresses treachery in a casual encounter and impulsive attack scenario.
*   **People v. Magallanes, 341 Phil. 216 (1997):**  Reiterates the elements of treachery and its inapplicability to chance encounters and impulsive attacks.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Used as basis for modifying the damage awards.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the appeal, modifying the conviction from Murder to Homicide. This change hinged on the court's finding that treachery was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. The key risk area was the subjective interpretation of Bulutano's actions and whether they constituted a deliberate strategy to ensure the victim's death without risk to himself. The application of relevant jurisprudence concerning treachery in spontaneous altercations was crucial in the final outcome.
