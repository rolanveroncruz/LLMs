**Legal Document Summary: Barons Marketing Corp. v. Court of Appeals and Phelps Dodge Phils., Inc. G.R. No. 126486, February 9, 1998**

**Nature:** Collection Suit; Appeal regarding abuse of right, interest, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contractual Relationship:** Phelps Dodge (Phelps Dodge, Philippines, Inc.) appointed Barons Marketing Corporation as a dealer of electrical wires and cables with 60-day credit terms (effective September 1, 1973).
*   **Debt:** Barons Marketing incurred a debt of P4,102,438.30 between December 1986 and August 17, 1987, for purchases of electrical wires and cables, which were subsequently sold to MERALCO.
*   **Interest and Penal Clause:** Sales invoices stipulated 12% interest per annum on overdue accounts, plus 25% on said amount for attorney’s fees and collection. This 25% clause is treated as a penal clause.
*   **Partial Payment Offer:** Barons Marketing offered to pay in monthly installments of P500,000.00 with 1% interest, which Phelps Dodge rejected.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Modified the trial court's decision, awarding Phelps Dodge P3,802,478.20 plus 12% interest and 5% attorney's fees. The Supreme Court would later modify the attorneys fees.

**Obligations:**

*   Barons Marketing: Obligated to pay Phelps Dodge the outstanding debt.
*   Phelps Dodge: Subject to the limitations on the exercise of contractual rights under Art. 19 of the Civil Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   Barons Marketing: Liable for the principal debt, 12% interest per annum (computed from the expiration of the 60-day credit term), and 10% of the principal for attorney's and collection fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Penal Clause:** While generally enforceable, penal clauses can be reduced by the court if "iniquitous or unconscionable" (Art. 1229, Civil Code).
*   **Abuse of Rights Argument (Art. 19, Civil Code):** Although Barons argued that Phelps Dodge's refusal to accept installment payments constituted an abuse of rights, the Court found no bad faith or intent to prejudice on Phelps Dodge's part. However, this argument is consistently raised in similar collection cases.
*   **Interpretation of Sales Invoices:** The specific wording of the sales invoices regarding interest and attorney’s fees is crucial. Ambiguity in the terms could lead to disputes over the amount owed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:** Art. 19 (abuse of right), Art. 21, Art. 1229 (reduction of penalty), Art. 1248 (partial prestations), Art. 2219, Art. 2227.
*   **Melendez v. Lavarias, 9 SCRA 548 (1963).** Cited regarding the right to file an action for collection is beyond cavil.
*   **Globe Mackay Cable and Radio Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 176 SCRA 778 (1989).** Cited regarding Art. 19 of the Civil Code as a "primordial limitation on all rights."
*   **Ford Philippines v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 99039, February 3, 1997.** Cited regarding the rule that good faith is presumed.
*   **Luneta Motor Co. v. Mora, 73 Phil. 80 (1941).** Cited regarding the rule that the stipulation providing for 25% on said amount for attorney's fees and collection constitutes what is known as a penal clause.
*   **Polytrade Corporation v. Blanco, 30 SCRA 187 (1969).** Cited regarding the rule that attorneys’ fees are in the nature of liquidated damages and the stipulation therefor is aptly called a penal clause.
*   **Korean Airlines Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 717 (1994); see also: Asset Privatization Trust v. CA, 214 SCRA 400 (1994).** Cited regarding the Courts authority to review matters, even if they are not assigned as errors in their appeal, if it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just decision of the case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"25% on said amount for attorney’s fees and collection":** This clause is a primary point of contention, especially in the context of the high interest already accrued. While considered a penal clause, its reasonableness is questionable given the overall amount and the fact that the court has the power to adjust it.

**Overall Assessment:**

The key takeaway is the enforceability of the contract and the debtor's obligation to pay. However, the court will scrutinize the penal clause for unconscionability. The abuse of right argument, while unsuccessful here, highlights a potential area of challenge in similar cases, hinging on demonstrating bad faith or intent to prejudice.
