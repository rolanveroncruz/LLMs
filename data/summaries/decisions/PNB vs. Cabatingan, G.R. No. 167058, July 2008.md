**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine National Bank vs. Spouses Tomas Cabatingan and Agapita Edullantes***

**Case:** G.R. No. 167058, July 9, 2008

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution regarding the annulment of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Spouses Cabatingan (Respondents) obtained loans totaling P421,200 from Philippine National Bank (PNB) (Petitioner), secured by a real estate mortgage under Act 3135 (extrajudicial foreclosure law).
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Respondents defaulted, leading PNB to extrajudicially foreclose on the mortgage.
*   **Auction Sale:** The properties were sold at public auction on November 5, 1991, between 9:00 a.m. and 9:20 a.m. PNB was the highest bidder.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC annulled the sale, citing non-compliance with Section 4 of Act 3135, arguing the sale was for only 20 minutes instead of the entire prescribed time.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the RTC decision, holding that Section 4 of Act 3135 requires the sale to occur *between* 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., not *for the entire duration* of that timeframe. The 20-minute sale was therefore valid. The Court interprets "between" as merely specifying a time interval.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Debtor Obligation:** Respondents had a continuing obligation to repay the loan.
*   **Creditor's Right:** PNB had the right to foreclose on the mortgage upon default.
*   **Auction Requirements:** Act 3135 governs the procedural requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure sales.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Between":** The core issue was the interpretation of "between the hours of nine in the morning and four in the afternoon" in Section 4 of Act 3135. The RTC interpreted it as requiring the sale process to continue for that entire duration, while the Supreme Court interpreted it as defining a permissible timeframe. This interpretation is crucial and sets a precedent for future foreclosures.
*   **Amount of Debt:** The document notes that Respondent's debt ballooned to P1,990,421.21 at the time of foreclosure. While Respondents did not contest this amount, the calculation of this amount and the associated interest and penalties could be a future point of contention should the case be revived.
*   **Lack of Writ of Possession:** The fact that no writ of possession was issued to PNB after the certificate of sale may create future complications regarding ownership and possession of the properties.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act 3135:** *An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted In or Annexed to Real Estate Mortgages.* This is the primary statute governing the case. Section 4 is the central provision in dispute.
*   **A.M. No. 99-10-05-O and Circular No. 7-2002:** These rules govern foreclosure proceedings. The Court noted the ambiguity/lack of specific guidance in these rules regarding the duration of the auction sale.
*   **Luna v. Encarnacion, 92 Phil. 531, 534 (1952):** Cited as precedent concerning the regulation of extrajudicial sales under Act 3135.
*   **Cosico, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 338 Phil. 1080, 1089 (1997):** Cited for the principle that statutes should be sensibly construed to give effect to legislative intention.

**Contention Points:**

*   The duration of the auction sale was the primary contentious point. The RTC found it insufficient, while the Supreme Court deemed it compliant with Act 3135.

**Conclusion:**

This resolution clarifies that the auction sale in an extrajudicial foreclosure under Act 3135 only needs to occur *within* the timeframe of 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and not for the entirety of the duration. This provides greater flexibility for creditors. However, other aspects such as the calculation of the debt and issuance of a writ of possession should be verified for completeness of foreclosure process.
