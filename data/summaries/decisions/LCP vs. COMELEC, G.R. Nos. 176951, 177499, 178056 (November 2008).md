Okay, here's a legally precise summary of the *League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC* case, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: *League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC* (G.R. Nos. 176951, 177499, 178056)**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for prohibition under Rule 65, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, challenging the constitutionality of sixteen (16) Cityhood Laws.

**Facts:**
*   During the 11th Congress, numerous municipalities had cityhood bills under consideration.
*   RA 9009, amending Section 450 of the Local Government Code (LGC), increased the income requirement for cityhood from P20 million to P100 million.
*   The 12th and 13th Congresses considered resolutions to exempt municipalities with pending cityhood bills from the increased income requirement, but these failed to pass the Senate.
*   Sixteen municipalities then pursued individual cityhood bills with clauses explicitly exempting them from RA 9009's income requirement. These bills lapsed into law.
*   The League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) and several existing cities challenged the constitutionality of these Cityhood Laws, arguing violations of Section 10, Article X (creation of LGUs), and the Equal Protection Clause.

**Issues:**

1.  Do the Cityhood Laws violate Section 10, Article X of the Constitution by exempting respondent municipalities from the P100M income requirement in the LGC?
2.  Do the Cityhood Laws violate the Equal Protection Clause by granting special treatment to the respondent municipalities?

**Ruling:** Yes to both issues. The Supreme Court *granted* the petitions and declared the Cityhood Laws unconstitutional.

**Key Provisions and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 10, Article X, 1987 Constitution:** Requires creation of LGUs "in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code."
*   **Section 6, Article X of the Constitution:** Local government units shall have a just share, as determined by law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released to them.
*   **Section 450, Local Government Code (as amended by RA 9009):**  Sets the requirements for conversion of a municipality into a city, including a P100 million annual income.
*   **Equal Protection Clause (Section 1, Article III, 1987 Constitution):** Prohibits denial to any person of the equal protection of the laws.
*   **RA 9009:** The amendment to Section 450 of the LGC, increasing the income requirement.

**Legal Analysis and Reasoning:**

*   **Violation of Sec. 10, Art. X:**
    *   The Court held that Congress must prescribe ALL criteria for city creation in the LGC itself, not in separate laws. The exemption in the Cityhood Laws, not being part of the LGC, was unconstitutional.
    *   Furthermore, the cityhood laws violate Section 6, Article X because they prevent a fair and just distribution of the national taxes to local government units. A city with an annual income of only P20 million should not receive the same share in national taxes as a city with an annual income of P100 million or more.
    *   The application of RA 9009 was prospective, not retroactive, as the law took effect before the Cityhood Laws were enacted.
*   **Violation of Equal Protection Clause:**
    *   The exemption granted to the municipalities with pending bills lacked a valid classification.  The mere pendency of a bill is not a substantial distinction rationally related to the purpose of preventing fiscally non-viable municipalities from becoming cities.  The classification is based on past conditions only, not applicable to all similarly situated.
    * Cites *Mayflower Farms, Inc. v. Ten Eyck* as an example of a law that violated the equal protection clause.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Commission on Elections (COMELEC):** Enjoined from conducting plebiscites pursuant to the Cityhood Laws.
*   **Respondent Municipalities:** No legal basis to operate as cities.
*   **Existing Cities:** Their share of Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) is protected from dilution by the unconstitutional creation of new cities.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Standing:** The Court affirmed the standing of the LCP, existing cities, and a taxpayer (Mayor Tre√±as).  Standing could have been a point of contention.
*   **Retroactivity:** The Court rejected the argument that applying RA 9009 was retroactive.
*   **Equal Protection Scrutiny:** The Court employed the rational basis test, finding no rational relationship between the classification and a legitimate state objective.
* The dissent argued that the court should've considered the intent of the 11th Congress.

**Dissent:**
The dissent argued for the constitutionality of the Cityhood Laws, emphasizing:
*   The intent of the Legislature, as evidenced in Senate deliberations, was that R.A. No. 9009 should not apply to cityhood bills that were already pending at the time of its enactment.
*   The unique and peculiar conditions of respondent municipalities warrant exempting them from R.A. No. 9009.
*   The non-retroactive effect of R.A. No. 9009 is not limited in application to conditions existing at the time of its enactment.
*   Petitioners were unable to overcome presumption of constitutionality of cityhood laws.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*Baker v. Carr
*House International Building Tenants Association, Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court
*Joya v. Presidential Commission on Good Government
*Integrated Bar of the Philippines v. Zamora
*Francisco, Jr. v. The House of Representatives
*Anak Mindanao Party-List Group v. The Executive Secretary
*Tan v. Commission on Elections
*Miranda v. Aguirre
*Agan v. Philippine International Air Terminals Co., Inc
*La Bugal-B'Laan Tribal Association, Inc. v. Ramos
*Mayflower Farms, Inc. v. Ten Eyck

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** The key contentious point is the interpretation of Section 10, Article X, regarding whether Congress can create exemptions to the LGC criteria in separate laws and the issue of equal protection.
