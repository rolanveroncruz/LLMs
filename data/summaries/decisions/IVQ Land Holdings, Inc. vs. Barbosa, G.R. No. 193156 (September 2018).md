## Legal Document Summary: *IVQ Land Holdings, Inc. vs. Reuben Barbosa* (G.R. No. 193156)

**Nature:** Resolution on a Petition for Cancellation and Quieting of Title.  The case involves a dispute over a parcel of land in Quezon City, with conflicting claims of ownership between IVQ Land Holdings, Inc. (IVQ) and Reuben Barbosa.

**Key Issue:**  Which party has a superior claim to the subject property, based on the validity and priority of their respective chains of title.

**Summary of Findings & Holding:** The Supreme Court denies IVQ's Second Motion for Reconsideration, effectively affirming the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the trial court's ruling in favor of Reuben Barbosa.  The Court finds that Barbosa adequately substantiated his title, while IVQ failed to present sufficient and credible evidence to support its claim.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Conflicting Titles:** Barbosa claims ownership based on a Deed of Absolute Sale from Therese Vargas whose TCT No. 159487 was allegedly issued earlier than Jorge Vargas III's TCT No. 223019, the predecessor of IVQ's title. IVQ claims ownership based on a Deed of Absolute Sale from Jorge Vargas III, who acquired it from Kawilihan Corporation.
*   **Best Evidence Rule Violated:**  The Court heavily criticized IVQ for submitting primarily photocopies of crucial documents, failing to adhere to the Best Evidence Rule. Citing *Philippine Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (464 Phil. 614, 643 (2004)) and *Heirs of Prodon v. Heirs of Alvarez* (717 Phil. 54, 66-67 (2013)), the Court emphasizes the need for original documents absent a valid justification for their non-production.
*   **Admission by Counsel Binding:** The court reiterated that IVQ was bound by their counsel's admission regarding the authenticity of the Deed of Absolute Sale.
*   **Defect in Notarization of Barbosa's Deed:** A certification indicated a potential defect in the notarization of the Deed of Absolute Sale between Therese Vargas and Barbosa. The Court acknowledges this, but it ultimately finds that Barbosa testified to the deed's genuineness and due execution and presented the original. The Court found such insufficiency to prove that the said deed was invalid and fake.
*   **FLS Number Typographical Error:** The LRA Director's letter explaining a typographical error in IVQ's title (FLS-2554-D instead of FLS-2544-D) was deemed insufficient to bolster IVQ's claim.  The Court relied on the case of *Heirs of Clemente Ermac v. Heirs of Vicente Ermac* (451 Phil. 368, 377 (2003)) to emphasize that a certificate of title is merely evidence of ownership, not ownership itself.
*   **Action to Quiet Title:** The Court reiterated the elements for an action to quiet title, citing *Secuya v. De Selma* (383 Phil. 126, 134 (2000)).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Barbosa's Title:** Despite the ruling in Barbosa's favor, the issues surrounding the notarization of his deed raise concerns about the complete security of his title. While IVQ's former counsel admitted the genuineness of the document, a more thorough investigation into the notarization discrepancy might be warranted.
*   **Lost Documents:** The lack of traceback titles and supporting documents in the Registry of Deeds of Quezon City, as noted by the Task Force Titulong Malinis of the LRA, creates uncertainty and raises questions about the integrity of the land registration system. The LRA also could not ascertain which of the two (2) titles is spurious [and] which is not.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 476:**  Action to Quiet Title
*   **Rules of Evidence, Best Evidence Rule:** Requiring originals of documents
*   *Secuya v. De Selma*, 383 Phil. 126, 134 (2000): Elements of Action to Quiet Title
*   *Philippine Banking Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, 464 Phil. 614, 643 (2004): Best Evidence Rule
*   *Heirs of Prodon v. Heirs of Alvarez*, 717 Phil. 54, 66-67 (2013): Best Evidence Rule
*    *Heirs of Clemente Ermac v. Heirs of Vicente Ermac*, 451 Phil. 368, 377 (2003): Ownership vs. Certificate of Title

**Conclusion:**

The Court ultimately ruled against IVQ due to its failure to adhere to the Best Evidence Rule and its inability to provide sufficient evidence that outweighed Barbosa's claim. While Barbosa prevailed, lingering questions surrounding the integrity of the documentary evidence and the land registration records create a degree of uncertainty. Further investigation into the notarization of the Deeds of Absolute Sale and the missing Registry of Deeds records might provide closure.
