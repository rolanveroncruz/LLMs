Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Mariners Polytechnic Colleges Foundation, Inc. vs. Arturo J. Garchitorena* (G.R. No. 162253, August 13, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45.  Addresses procedural dismissal by the Court of Appeals (CA) of a labor case.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Employment History:** Arturo J. Garchitorena was hired as a college instructor in 1986, took a leave, and was rehired in 1992. He continuously taught until the first semester of 1997-1998 when he was not given a regular teaching load.
*   **Dispute:** Garchitorena alleged illegal dismissal. The school claimed non-renewal of a service contract (allegedly due to concerns of burnout), arguing he was not a regular employee.
*   **Labor Arbiter (LA) Decision:** Ruled in favor of Garchitorena.  The LA found that he was a regular employee from 1992 onward, not a probationary one, and could only be dismissed for just cause and with due process under Article 279 of the Labor Code. The LA deemed the non-renewal of the service contract as an act of constructive dismissal.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Affirmed the LA's decision, emphasizing the complainant's full-time instructor status and the lack of a service contract upon rehiring in 1992.
*   **CA Dismissal:** The CA dismissed Mariners Polytechnic Colleges Foundation, Inc.'s Petition for Certiorari outright, citing failure to attach copies of the complaint, position papers, and replies as required by Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the CA erred in dismissing the petition outright for failure to include the required documents.
2.  Whether the CA erred in strictly applying procedural rules.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Meritorious Petition:** The Supreme Court (SC) found the petition to be meritorious, holding that the CA erred in its strict interpretation of procedural rules.
*   **Substantial Compliance:** The SC held that there was substantial compliance with Section 3 of Rule 46 because the attached documents (LA decision, Memorandum of Appeal with attached service contract and workload, NLRC decision, Motion for Reconsideration) sufficiently supported the allegations.
*   **Discretionary Application of Rule 46:** Citing *Atillo v. Bombay*, 404 Phil. 179 (2001), the Court reiterated the principle that the mandatory requirement of attaching pleadings and other material portions of the record contemplates the exercise of discretion on the part of the petitioner in selecting relevant documents.
*   **Remand to CA:** The SC set aside the CA's Resolutions and remanded the case for further proceedings and appropriate action.

**Key Legal Points:**

*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Pertains to security of tenure for regular employees; dismissal requires just cause and due process.
*   **Section 3, Rule 46 of the Rules of Court:** Concerns the contents and filing of petitions for certiorari, specifically the required attachments. Strict compliance is not always necessary.
*   **_Atillo v. Bombay_ (404 Phil. 179 (2001)):** Case law discussing the discretionary nature of attaching all pleadings to a petition for certiorari, focusing on whether the included documents sufficiently support the petition's allegations.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The LA found that the non-renewal of the employment contract was indeed a form of constructive dismissal.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Regular vs. Probationary Employment:** The main point of contention hinges on Garchitorena's employment status as a regular or probationary employee.
*   **Service Contract:** The validity and effect of the service contract signed by the petitioner and the respondent.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The court noted that the petitioner failed to substantiate with evidence the alleged complaints against the respondent to merit his dismissal.
