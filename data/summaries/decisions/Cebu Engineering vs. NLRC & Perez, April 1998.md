## Legal Document Summary - *Cebu Engineering and Development Company, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Jaime Perez* (G.R. No. 118695, April 22, 1998)

**Case Summary:** CEDCO (Petitioner) seeks to annul the NLRC decision finding it liable for illegal dismissal and damages to Jaime Perez (Respondent). The central issue is whether Perez was illegally dismissed and is entitled to reinstatement and back wages.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Regular Employment:** The NLRC correctly reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision and ruled that Perez was a **regular employee**, not a project employee. This determination was based on:
    *   Perez performing activities **necessary and desirable** to CEDCO's business (engineering and development).
    *   Perez belonging to a **work pool** assigned to different projects.
    *   Perez's employment lasting for more than one year, automatically converting him to a regular employee **irrespective of any contract to the contrary** (citing *Baguio Country Club Corporation v. NLRC*).
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Perez's dismissal was deemed illegal due to:
    *   Lack of **just cause**: Allegations of insubordination, overpricing, and incompetence were unsupported by evidence. The stated reason of redundancy was not proven.
    *   Lack of **due process**: CEDCO failed to provide the **two written notices** required for termination (citing *Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. v. NLRC*).
    *   Violation of the **contractual stipulation** requiring a 10-day notice from the Project Manager prior to cancellation.
*   **Remedies:** The NLRC was within its authority to order:
    *   **Reinstatement**: Relief was specifically requested in the complaint and notice of appeal. The NLRC has broad powers under **Art. 218 (c) of the Labor Code** to correct errors.
    *   **Back Wages**: Awarded from the date of dismissal until actual reinstatement, as a consequence of finding Perez to be a regular employee, not a project employee whose employment ended with the project's completion.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **CEDCO (Petitioner):** Liable for illegal dismissal and ordered to:
    *   Reinstate Jaime Perez to his former position without loss of seniority rights and benefits.
    *   Pay full back wages from the date of dismissal until actual reinstatement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Reinstatement:** Potential difficulties in enforcing reinstatement if the former position no longer exists.
*   **Quantification of Back Wages:** Potential dispute over the exact amount of back wages due.
*   **Alleged Infractions**: If CEDCO presents more solid proof of insubordination etc, they may be liable for a lesser penalty
*   **Contractual Clause**: Enforceability of contractual clause for the 10 day notice period if it is shown the termination was for just cause.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 218, Sec. (c):** NLRC's appellate powers to correct errors.
*   ***Baguio Country Club Corporation v. NLRC***: Establishes the principle of automatic regularization after one year of service.
*   ***Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. v. NLRC***: Outlines the requirements for due process in termination cases.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. POEA***: Definition of jurisdiction

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The "Contract for Personal Services" is deemed a potential device for circumventing security of tenure. While not explicitly ambiguous, its intent and enforceability are challenged due to the surrounding circumstances.

**Conclusion:**

The NLRC's decision is likely to be upheld due to the strong evidence of regular employment, lack of just cause for dismissal, and failure to observe due process. CEDCO faces significant financial liabilities and the obligation to reinstate Perez.
