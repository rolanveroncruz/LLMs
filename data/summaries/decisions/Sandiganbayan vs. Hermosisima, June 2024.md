*   **Section 20 of Rule 140:** Pertains to increasing the fine to an amount not exceeding double the maximum prescribed under Section 17 when an aggravating circumstance is present

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of Rule 140 Retroactively:**  The Court applies Rule 140 as amended, even though the Formal Charges were initially based on RACCS. This could be subject to challenge if the respondent argues that the application of the amended rule prejudices his rights.
*   **Assessment of Aggravating Circumstances:** Reliance on a previous finding of *Simple Misconduct* to *increase* the fine for Gross Misconduct could be challenged.
*   **Totality of Acts:** The Court's decision to treat the events of the Batasan Gate Incident as a single count of Gross Misconduct, based on the reasoning from *Banzuela-Didulo v. Santizo,* needs careful review.

**Note:** Hermosisima resigned *before* judgment, which precluded dismissal as a penalty. The penalties imposed are in lieu of dismissal. His resignation and failure to participate in the proceedings were considered an indicium of guilt.

**Recommendation:** Review application of Rule 140 retroactivity and the weight given to the prior "Simple Misconduct" finding. Examine the elements required for a single count of gross misconduct based on *Banzuela-Didulo v. Santizo.*
