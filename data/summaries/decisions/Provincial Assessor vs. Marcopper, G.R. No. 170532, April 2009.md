**Case Summary: Provincial Assessor of Marinduque vs. Court of Appeals and Marcopper Mining Corporation, G.R. No. 170532, April 24, 2009**

**Core Issue:** Whether Marcopper Mining Corporation's Siltation Dam and Decant System is exempt from real property tax under Section 234(e) of RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991) as "machinery and equipment used for pollution control and environmental protection."

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 7160, Sec. 234(e):** Provides for exemptions from real property tax for machinery and equipment used for pollution control and environmental protection.
*   **RA 7160, Sec. 199(o):** Defines "machinery". The Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA) interpreted this narrowly, stating that the Siltation Dam was not "machinery" because it did not produce anything nor act as auxiliary to a production process.
*   **RA 7942, Sec. 91 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995):** Provides incentives for pollution control devices acquired, constructed, or installed by contractors, exempting them from real property tax.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The Provincial Assessor argues the CA erred by disregarding the LBAA and CBAA's factual findings that the Siltation Dam was not in operation since 1993 and that Marcopper lacked a DENR tax exemption certificate. The Siltation Dam is a structure, not machinery.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** Marcopper argued the Siltation Dam qualifies as a "machinery" and is essential for pollution control, a requirement mandated by the DENR.
*  **Court of Appeals holding:** Siltation dam qualified as machinery and was actually and directly used for mining business.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court sided with the Provincial Assessor, finding the CA committed grave abuse of discretion, it focused on the fact that for real property tax assessment purposes it was a structure, not machinery and was intended for pollution control purposes but had not been used for that purpose during assessment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Taxpayer (Marcopper):** Obligation to pay real property taxes if the Siltation Dam does not qualify for exemption under RA 7160, Sec. 234(e). Obligation under Sec 206 of RA 7160, to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that its claim for exemption has legal and factual basis by filing with the provincial assessor.
*   **Local Government (Marinduque):** Right to collect real property taxes, but must adhere to the statutory exemptions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Machinery" and "Equipment":** The core dispute centers on whether the Siltation Dam falls within the statutory definition of "machinery" or "equipment." The ambiguous wording of Sec. 199(o) of RA 7160 leaves room for interpretation.
*   **"Actual Use" Requirement:** The exemption hinges on "actual, direct, and exclusive use" for pollution control. The documented non-operational status of the Siltation Dam presents a significant risk to Marcopper's exemption claim.
*   **Procedural Compliance:** Marcopper's failure to file the appropriate documentation within the prescribed timeframe of Sec. 206 of RA 7160 could jeopardize its exemption claim.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991), Sec. 199(o), Sec. 206, Sec. 234(e)**
*   **RA 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995), Sec. 3(am), Sec. 91**

**Case Law:**

*   **Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos:**  Clarifies that exemptions under Sec. 234 of RA 7160 are based on ownership, character, and use of property. The term usage means direct, immediate and actual application of the property itself to the exempting purpose.
*   **Benguet Corporation v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals:**  (Cited by LBAA) Originally ruled that a tailings dam is a permanent improvement, not exempt from real property tax. The Supreme Court distinguished this from a property actually used for pollution control.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the "Siltation Dam" could be classified as a "machinery and equipment" as referred to in R.A. No. 7160, considering its composition and function.
*   The impact of the damaged and non-operational status of the Siltation Dam on its eligibility for tax exemption.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court favored the Provincial Assessor. The Court emphasized that Marcopper failed to prove that the subject property was actually, directly, and exclusively used for pollution control and environmental protection during the assessment period.
