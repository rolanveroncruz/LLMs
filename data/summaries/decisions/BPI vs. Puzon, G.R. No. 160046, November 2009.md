## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Puzon, G.R. No. 160046

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the trial court's annulment of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.

**Facts:** Respondent Puzon mortgaged her property to Citytrust (now BPI) as security for a loan. She defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure and eventual consolidation of title by Citytrust Realty Corporation. Puzon filed for annulment, alleging non-compliance with posting and publication requirements under Act 3135 and PD 1079.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** The central issue is the compliance with statutory requirements for posting and publication of the Notice of Sheriff's Sale.
*   **Act No. 3135, Section 3:** Requires posting of notices for at least 20 days in three public places and publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation if the property's value exceeds P400.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1079:** Governs the publication of judicial notices, requiring publication in newspapers published, edited, and circulated in the city/province where general circulation is required.  It also specifies a procedure for raffle of notices amongst qualified publications.
*   **Posting Requirements:** The CA and trial court invalidated the sale because the Sheriff's Certificate stated posting in "conspicuous places" rather than "public places" and lacked explicit confirmation of a 20-day posting period.
*   **Publication Requirements:** The CA questioned whether "The Guardian" newspaper was qualified under PD 1079, despite being of general circulation.
*   **Promissory Note and Real Estate Mortgage**: Respondent executed a promissory note and mortgage in favor of Citytrust. Paragraph 9 of the mortgage stipulated that a breach or violation of the terms of the debt instrument would cause the entire obligation to become immediately due and payable and defaulted, entitling the Mortgagee to foreclose the mortgage.
*   **Default of Mortgage Obligation:**  The trial court determined that the Respondent defaulted in her mortgage obligation. Her failure was a violation of the terms and conditions stated on the promissory note, which caused the entire obligation secured by the mortgage to become immediately due, payable, and demandable, and entitled Citytrust to foreclose the mortgage in accordance with their stipulation in paragraph 9 of the First Real Estate Mortgage.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mortgagor (Puzon):** Obligated to repay the loan according to the promissory note and mortgage agreement. Liable for default.
*   **Mortgagee (Citytrust/BPI):** Obligated to comply with statutory requirements for extrajudicial foreclosure under Act 3135 and PD 1079.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted** the petition, reversing the CA and upholding the validity of the foreclosure sale.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court emphasized the presumption of regularity in foreclosure proceedings and that the burden to rebut this lies with the party challenging the proceedings.  Respondent failed to present evidence proving the "conspicuous places" were not "public places." (Rule 131 of the Rules of Court).
*   **Publication as Sufficient Compliance:**  Citing *DBP v. Aguirre*, the Court reiterated that publication in a newspaper of general circulation is sufficient even if posting requirements aren't perfectly met.
*   **Compliance with PD 1079:**  The Court found Citytrust presented sufficient evidence ("The Guardian" Newspaper and Certification issued by the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City) demonstrating compliance with PD 1079, particularly regarding the newspaper's qualification.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Sheriff's Certificate:** The difference in wording ("conspicuous" vs. "public") in the Sheriff's Certificate created an opportunity for challenge.  While ultimately resolved in BPI's favor, meticulous documentation and adherence to statutory language are crucial.
*   **Lack of Specific Evidence:**  The original ruling hinged on the absence of *explicit* evidence of compliance, highlighting the importance of comprehensive and well-documented proof of posting and publication. The party alleging non-compliance with publication requirement has the burden of proving the same.
*   **Newspaper Accreditation:** While the certification eventually bolstered BPI's case, any ambiguity regarding the newspaper's accreditation under PD 1079 introduces risk.
*   **Estoppel Argument:** The argument that Puzon was estopped by requesting an extension of the redemption period was raised, but not central to the decision.  This could be a relevant factor in similar cases.
*   **Laches Argument:**  Citytrust argued that the respondent is barred by laches, but this was not the controlling point for the court's ultimate decision.
    The fact that Puzon admitted her inability to pay her account strengthens Citytrust's defense of laches.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act No. 4118):** Regulates sale of property under special powers in real estate mortgages.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1079:** Regulates publication of judicial notices.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(m), Rules of Court:** Presumption of regularity in performance of official duty.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Aguirre, 417 Phil. 235 (2001):*** Publication is sufficient compliance with posting requirement.
*   ***Consuelo Metal Corporation v. Planters Development Bank, G.R. No. 152580, 26 June 2008, 555 SCRA 465:*** Foreclosure proceedings have in their favor the presumption of regularity and the party who seeks to challenge the proceedings has the burden of evidence to rebut the same.

**Conclusion:** This case underscores the importance of meticulously following the procedural requirements of Act 3135 and PD 1079 in extrajudicial foreclosures and maintaining complete and unambiguous documentation to support compliance. The Supreme Court's emphasis on the presumption of regularity and the burden of proof on the challenger provides some protection to mortgagees, but careful attention to detail is still paramount.
