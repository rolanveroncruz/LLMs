**Case Summary: ABC Davao Auto Supply, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, Abundio T. Merced (G.R. No. 113296)**

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision nullifying the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** ABC Davao Auto Supply (Petitioner) sued Abundio T. Merced (Respondent) for a sum of money representing unpaid balance for vehicular parts purchased on credit. The agreement included 12% interest on overdue amounts and 25% attorney's fees in case of default (see footnote 1 for details).
*   **Shifting Judges:** Multiple judges presided over the case during pre-trial and trial, including Judges Pacita Canizares-Nye, Alejandro Siazon, Cristeto Dinopol, Renato Fuentes, Roque Agton, and Romeo Marasigan.
*   **Decision by Transferred Judge:** Judge Roque Agton, who heard the evidence, rendered the decision *after* being transferred to another branch of the RTC within the same judicial region (footnote 3).
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Judge Romeo Marasigan, the judge who replaced Judge Agton, denied the motion for reconsideration of Judge Agton's decision.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA nullified Judge Agton's decision, arguing that he was no longer the *de jure* or *de facto* judge of the RTC Branch XVI when he rendered it.

**Legal Issue:** Whether the decision rendered by Judge Agton after his transfer to another branch of the RTC is valid.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA and reinstated Judge Agton's decision. The SC reasoned that any defect in the decision was cured when Judge Marasigan denied the Motion for Reconsideration of Judge Agton's decision which indicated that he subscribed with and adopted Judge Agton's decision in toto. The SC invoked the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties (Rule 131, Section 3(m), Rules of Court), and cited jurisprudence indicating that a judgment is binding if signed and promulgated during the judge's incumbency, even if the judge is now assigned to a different branch of the same court.

**Statutory References:**

*   **B.P. 129:** Mentioned in relation to the rule that the judge who pens the decision needs to be an incumbent judge at the time the decision is promulgated.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(m), Rules of Court:** Presumption of regularity in performance of official duty.
*   **Rule 1, Section 6, Rules of Court:** Mandating just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of actions.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Labao 220 SCRA 100 (1993), Lao v. To-Chip, 158 SCRA 243 (1988) and People v. CFI of Quezon, Branch X, 227 SCRA 457, 461 (1993).** are cited.
*   **Siazon v. Judge of CFI Cotabato, 26 SCRA 664 (1969).**
*   **People v. Gorospe, 129 SCRA 233 citing Lumpay v. Moscoso, 105 Phil. 968.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The main contentious issue is the validity of a judgment rendered by a judge after transfer to another branch. The CA argued that this rendered the decision invalid, while the SC held otherwise, provided there's an indication of adoption of the decision by the presiding judge (Judge Marasigan) through denial of the MR.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   The CA judgment initially created uncertainty and potentially opened the door to challenging other decisions rendered in similar circumstances.
*   The SC's decision affirmed the original RTC decision, meaning the Respondent is liable for the outstanding debt, interest, and potentially attorney's fees as stipulated in the agreement.

**Possible Arguments (hypothetical in a different case with similar facts):**

*   **Against Validity:** Arguing that the transfer of the judge strips him of the authority to decide cases in his former branch, potentially violating due process.
*   **For Validity:** Arguing that RTC branches are not distinct entities, and a judge's incumbency within the system allows the completion of pending decisions, provided there is evidence that the new judge subscribed with the decision.
