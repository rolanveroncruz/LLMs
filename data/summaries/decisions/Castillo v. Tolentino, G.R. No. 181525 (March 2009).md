## Legal Document Summary: *P'Carlo A. Castillo vs. Manuel Tolentino* (G.R. No. 181525)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals decision ordering the ejectment of the Petitioner, an agricultural lessee, and the removal of a concrete reservoir and dike he constructed on the leased land.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Leasehold Agreement:** Castillo (Lessee) had an agreement with Tolentino (Lessor) to till the land and pay 11 cavans per hectare every harvest.
*   **Construction of Reservoir:** Castillo constructed a concrete water reservoir and dike on the leased land despite Tolentino's explicit opposition and a warning from the Provincial Agrarian Reform Office (PARO).
*   **Section 32 RA 3844:** Agricultural lessee is required to provide notice to and consent of the agricultural lessor, before embarking upon the construction of a permanent irrigation system. 
*   **Section 36 RA 3844:** Lessor asserts that the construction constitutes grounds for dispossession as it changes the agreed land use and violates the lease contract.

**Liabilities & Remedies:**

*   **Ejectment:** The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the DARAB's original decision ordering Castillo's ejectment from the leasehold.
*   **Removal of Improvements:** Castillo is liable for removing the constructed reservoir and dike. Failure to do so allows Tolentino to remove it at Castillo's expense.
*   **Termination of Tenancy:** The leasehold agreement is terminated, ending the tenancy relationship.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Violation of Lease Agreement:** The unauthorized construction of the reservoir, absent the lessor's consent, constitutes a breach of the lease agreement, justifying dispossession.
*   **Impact on Landowner's Share:** The construction reduces tillable land, potentially affecting the landowner's share of the harvest.
*   **Abuse of Agrarian Rights:** The court viewed Castillo as abusing his rights as an agricultural lessee by acting unilaterally, disrespecting the landowner, and neglecting to secure Tolentino's consent, especially given the presence of existing free-flowing artesian wells.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code, as amended by RA 6389):** Primary legislation governing agricultural leasehold. Sections 32 and 36 are specifically invoked.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 22, Sec. 1:** Utilized to determine the timeliness of filing appeals, specifically related to weekend or legal holiday deadlines.
*   *Herbosa v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 119087, January 25, 2002, 374 SCRA 578 : Cited to support calculation for appeals and including the date of performance.
*   **Other Case Law:** Referenced extensively to support the interpretation of agrarian laws in light of social justice and property rights (e.g., *Bautista v. Mag-isa*, *De Jesus v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, *Cecilleville Realty and Service Corp. v. Court of Appeals*).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Proven Farm Practices" (RA 3844, Sec. 36):** The Court questioned whether the reservoir constituted a "proven farm practice" in the presence of existing artesian wells.
*   **Necessity of the Reservoir:** Whether the construction was truly necessary given the presence of free-flowing artesian wells. The Court sided with Tolentino that it was not.
*   **Good Faith Argument:** Castillo argued good faith in constructing the reservoir. Court rejected this, citing lack of consultation with and disrespect for the landowner.

**Analysis:**

The core issue is whether an agricultural lessee can unilaterally construct permanent improvements on the leased land without the lessor's consent.  The court held that the construction was a violation of the lease agreement, as it changed the agreed-upon land use, impacted the landowner's share, and was not demonstrated as a necessary or "proven" farm practice given the free flowing artesian wells. The Court leaned heavily against Castillo's actions, citing his lack of deference to Tolentino as well as his questionable actions.

The case serves as a cautionary tale for agricultural lessees regarding the scope of their rights and the importance of adhering to the terms of lease agreements and relevant agrarian laws, balancing the rights of lessees with the need to respect the rights of the landowners.
