## Legal Document Summary: Dolera v. People (G.R. No. 180693)

**Case:** Bonifacio Dolera y Tejada v. People of the Philippines (G.R. No. 180693, September 4, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming conviction for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal possession of dangerous drugs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 11, Article II, R.A. 9165:** Criminalizes possession of dangerous drugs without legal authorization. Requires proof of (a) possession of a prohibited drug, (b) lack of legal authorization, and (c) free and conscious awareness of possession.
*   **Section 21, Article II, R.A. 9165 & IRR:** Outlines the procedure for seizure and custody of dangerous drugs. Mandates immediate physical inventory and photographing of seized drugs *immediately* after seizure and confiscation *in the presence* of the accused (or representative/counsel), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.  In warrantless seizures, inventory and photography should be conducted at the place of seizure, or at the nearest police station. Crucially, the marking of seized items with initials and signature must be done *immediately upon confiscation* in the presence of the accused.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Critical element. The prosecution bears the burden of establishing an unbroken chain of custody from the time of seizure to presentation in court to ensure the integrity and identity of the evidence.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Accused was convicted of violating Sec. 11, Art. II, R.A. 9165 and sentenced to imprisonment and a fine. This conviction was overturned on appeal due to insufficient evidence and improper handling of evidence by law enforcement.
*   **Prosecution's Risk:** Failure to adhere strictly to the procedures outlined in Section 21, Article II, R.A. 9165 can lead to acquittal due to reasonable doubt regarding the integrity and identity of the seized drugs (corpus delicti). The prosecution's reliance on the presumption of regularity is insufficient when challenged by evidence suggesting a break in the chain of custody.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** defines the offense and penalties.
*   **Mallillin v. People:** Highlights the necessity of establishing the chain of custody with moral certainty. The dangerous drug itself is the *corpus delicti*.
*   **People v. Sanchez:** Emphasizes the importance of marking seized items immediately upon confiscation in the presence of the accused.
* People v. Timon (1997)
* People v. Nazareno (1996)
* People v. Tiu Won Chua (2003)
* People v. Agulay (2008)
* People v. Zeng Hua Dian (2004)
* People v. Tan (2002)
* People v. Sevilla (2000)
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Insufficient to overcome deficiencies in chain of custody when challenged by evidence. The presumption of innocence prevails.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The court found a significant break in the chain of custody.  Specifically:
    *   Lack of evidence showing how custody was transferred between arresting officers and investigators.
    *   Lack of evidence that items were inventoried/photographed and marked in the presence of the Petitioner.
    *   Missing marked plastic sachets.
    * No explanation of what steps were undertaken to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Stipulation:** The stipulation that the "allegedly confiscated items" were submitted for laboratory examination was insufficient to establish the chain of custody, as it did not prove that the items analyzed were the same ones seized from the petitioner.
*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Initially questioned, but the court held that the issue was waived since the defendant pleaded to the charges and participated actively in the trial.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody, creating reasonable doubt as to whether the evidence presented was the same as that allegedly seized from the accused. This case highlights the importance of strict compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 and implementing rules to ensure the integrity of drug evidence.
