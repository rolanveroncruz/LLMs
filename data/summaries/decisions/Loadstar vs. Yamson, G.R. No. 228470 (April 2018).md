Here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Loadstar International Shipping, Inc. vs. Ernesto Awiten Yamson (substituted by heirs)* G.R. No. 228470, April 23, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA Decision which reversed the NLRC and LA decisions.

**Key Issue:** Whether the seafarer Ernesto Yamson's illness (cerebrovascular disease: "left cerebellar infarct" and hypertension, Stage 2) is work-related/aggravated, entitling him to disability benefits under the 2010 POEA-SEC. Also, the court will resolve if the seaman is entitled to financial assistance in the face of his demise during litigation.

**Holding:** Petition Granted. CA Decision reversed and set aside. NLRC decision reinstated with modification: No disability compensation. Financial assistance of P75,000.00 is awarded to the heirs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations (2010 POEA-SEC Section 20):**

*   **Work-Related Injury/Illness:** Employer liable for wages, medical treatment (foreign & repatriation), sickness allowance (up to 120 days), and medicine costs (prescribed by company doctor).
*   **Post-Employment Medical Examination:** Seafarer must submit to company doctor within 3 days of repatriation (unless incapacitated). Regular reporting to the doctor is mandatory.
*   **Dispute Resolution:** If seafarer's doctor disagrees, a third doctor, jointly agreed upon, makes the final and binding assessment.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Disability Compensation:** CA awarded US$60,000 in disability benefits. SC reversed because the seafarer failed to present substantial evidence to support work-relatedness or work-aggravation.
*   **Sickness Allowance & Medical Expenses:** CA affirmed the award of sickness allowance (US$2,328.00) and medical/transportation expenses (P31,738.18) by NLRC. SC deleted this award because the seafarer failed to complete his post-medical examination.
*   **Financial Assistance:** In lieu of disability/illness compensation, the Supreme Court is awarding P75,000.00 due to Yamson's Death while undergoing litigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law, but exceptions exist (conflicting factual findings).
*   **2010 Amended POEA-SEC:** Governs the employment contract. (POEA Memorandum Circular No. 10, Series of 2010) Section 20 is critical, defining employer's liabilities and seafarer's obligations.
*   ***Andrada v. Agemar Manning Agency, Inc.*** (698 Phil. 170 (2012)): Company-designated physician's assessment is primary but not automatically binding. Third doctor's opinion is final if sought.
*   ***Status Maritime Corporation, et al. v. Spouses Delalamon*** (740 Phil. 175, 194 (2014)): PEME is a summary examination and not conclusive on pre-existing conditions.
* ***Doehle-Philman Manning Agency, Inc., et al. v. Haro*** (784 Phil. 840, 850 (2016)): Two elements for disability compensation: The injury/illness must be work-related, and the work-related injury/illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Work-Relatedness:** The key point of contention. The court found insufficient evidence to link Yamson's stroke to his work environment. The court will not grant compensation based on speculation, presumption, and conjectures.
*   **Completion of Post-Employment Medical Examination:** There are conflicting claims of non-compliance, but SC will disregard because there is unsubstantiated declarations of insufficiency to establish the case.
*   **Fraudulent Misrepresentation:** The argument that Yamson failed to disclose prior medical history, but this claim was rejected because PEEM does not explore all pre-existing conditions.
*   **Evaluation of Medical Condition:** The court found that both parties failed to fully exhaust the remedies afforded to them by the 2010 Amended POEA-SEC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The seafarer bears the burden of proving work-relatedness. General statements and a one-day medical certificate are insufficient.
*   **Company-Designated Physician's Authority:** Though not absolute, the company doctor's opinion carries significant weight. Failure to follow procedures for challenging it (e.g., seeking a third doctor) can be detrimental.
*   **Incomplete Documentation:** Lack of thorough medical records and diagnostics from both sides weakened their respective arguments.
