## Legal Document Summary - *Tamayo v. People*, G.R. No. 174698

**Case:** *Aurora Tamayo v. People of the Philippines and Heirs of Pedro Sotto* (G.R. No. 174698, July 28, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC's denial of a motion to suspend the execution of a final and executory estafa conviction.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Conviction:** Petitioner Tamayo was convicted of estafa under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code for defrauding the Sotto spouses regarding the assembly of a jeepney. The RTC sentenced her to an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of *prision correccional* to 17 years of *reclusion temporal*, and ordered her to pay actual and moral damages.
*   **Affirmance:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision *in toto*.
*   **Finality:** The CA's decision became final and executory on June 1, 2004, as no appeal was filed.
*   **Motion to Suspend Execution:** Petitioner filed a motion to suspend the writ of execution, claiming a compromise agreement with the victim (Pedro Sotto) prior to finality, evidenced by receipts showing reimbursement of P120,000.
*   **RTC Denial:** The RTC denied the motion, stating it lacked jurisdiction to modify a final judgment.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The petitioner argued the compromise agreement extinguished her criminal and civil liability, and blamed her former counsel for failing to present this evidence to the appellate court.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Tamayo has an existing criminal liability for Estafa. The SC reiterated that a compromise agreement does not extinguish criminal liability, citing *Firaza v. People*, *Recuerdo v. People*, and *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Tonda*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Tamayo has a civil liability, but she failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove a compromise agreement existed and has not proven the validity of the receipt used as proof of the compromise.
*   **Obligation to Serve Sentence:** Tamayo is now obligated to serve the prison sentence imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Imprisonment:** Immediate risk of imprisonment due to the issuance of an arrest warrant for serving the sentence.
*   **Liability on Bond:** The Commonwealth Insurance Company faces potential judgment against her bond if the petitioner does not surrender.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315, Revised Penal Code (Estafa):** Defines and penalizes estafa; determines the range of penalties based on the amount defrauded.
*   **Rule 120, Section 7, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Governs modification of judgments, limiting it to cases before finality.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 122, Section 6; Rule 124, Section 16; Rule 125, Section 2, in relation to Rule 45, Section 2:** Rules related to criminal procedure and the perfecting of an appeal in criminal cases.

**Case Law:**

*   **Firaza v. People, Recuerdo v. People, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Tonda:** Cited for the principle that reimbursement or compromise in estafa cases affects only civil liability, not criminal liability.
*   **Ceniza-Manantan v. People:** Addresses counsel's negligence and its binding effect on the client.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The alleged compromise agreement:** The existence and validity are disputed by the victim's heirs. The SC found the petitioner failed to provide convincing evidence that the receipt was genuine. The burden of proof was on the petitioner.
*   **Incorrect Penalty Imposed:** The SC acknowledged the RTC imposed an erroneous minimum term in the indeterminate sentence but stated it cannot be corrected because the judgment is final. This may open avenues for post-conviction relief if valid claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can be established (though unlikely given the burden is now on the petitioner to prove this was gross negligence that caused harm).

**Analysis:**

The SC held that the compromise agreement, even if proven, would not extinguish criminal liability for estafa. Also, it is too late for the petitioner to claim the judgment was incorrect. The key issue is the finality of the CA decision, which precludes further review or modification. The petitioner is bound by the negligence of her counsel unless gross negligence deprived her of due process.
