## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Blor et al.*

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 227405, September 05, 2018 (839 Phil. 1056)

**Subject Matter:** Administrative liability for Grave Misconduct related to illegal procurement under RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (RIRR).

**Key Issue:** Whether the procurement of six iPad units by the Department of Agrarian Reform Provincial Office (DARPO) in Occidental Mindoro violated RA 9184, and whether the respondents are administratively liable.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) **reversed** the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, **reinstating** the Ombudsman's finding that respondents were guilty of Grave Misconduct for violating RA 9184.

**Key Provisions and Violations:**

*   **RA 9184 Violations:**
    *   **Lack of Competitive Bidding:** The purchase of the iPads did not undergo competitive bidding as mandated by RA 9184.
    *   **Violation of "No Brand Name Rule" (Sec. 18, RA 9184 IRR):** The procurement was effectively limited to iPads, a specific brand, without justification.
    *   **Non-Inclusion in Annual Procurement Plan (APP):** The requisition for iPads was not in the original 2013 APP. While it was updated later, this doesn't excuse the initial violation.
    *   **Lack of BAC Resolution:** No resolution from the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) prescribed the resort to shopping as a method of procurement.
    *   **Improper use of Shopping:** iPads, characterized by the courts as neither ordinary nor regular office supplies, are not amenable to procurement via shopping.

*   **Functions of the BAC (Sec. 12, RA 9184):** The BAC failed to ensure the procuring entity abided by the standards of the procurement law and IRR.

**Respondents and Liabilities:**

*   **Amado M. Blor (Officer-in-Charge (OlC)-Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer II (PARO)):** Approved the Requisition and Issue Slip (RIS), Request for Quotation (RFQ) and Disbursement Voucher (DV), signed the updated APP, and was an end-user.
*   **Jesus R. Barrera (Chairman, BAC; Chief Agrarian Reform Officer (CARO)):** Chairman of the BAC, head of the Inspection Committee, signed the RIS and Purchase Order.
*   **Angelina O. Quijano (Vice-Chairman, BAC; Chief Agrarian Reform Officer (CARO)):** Vice-Chairman of the BAC, an end-user.
*   **Potenciano G. Vicedo (Member, BAC; OIC-CARO):** Member of the BAC, an end-user.
*   **Miraflor B. Soliven (OIC-Accountant II):** Certified the availability of funds despite lacking documentation, signed the updated APP, and traveled to Manila to canvass Ipads.
*   **Annie F. Constantino (Acting Budget Officer/Bookkeeper):** Chairperson of the Canvass Committee, sent RFQs to suppliers, certified availability and obligation of appropriations in the Obligation Slip, and prepared the accounting entries in the Disbursement Voucher.

**Penalty:** All respondents were found guilty of Grave Misconduct and meted the penalty of DISMISSAL from the service with cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Primarily addresses competitive bidding and alternative methods of procurement.
*   **Revised IRR of RA 9184:** Provides detailed rules and procedures for implementing the Act.
*   *Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao v. Martel,* G.R. No. 221134, 1 March 2017, 819 SCRA 131, 146-147: Discusses that the absence of overpricing is not a mitigating factor, and the length of service as a mitigating or aggravating circumstance.
*   *Bureau of Internal Revenue v. Organo,* 468 Phil. 111, 118 (2004): Jurisprudence defines grave misconduct.
*   *Chavez v. Garcia,* 783 Phil. 562, 573 (2016): Jurisprudence defines grave misconduct.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in defining "ordinary office supply":** The classification of iPads as non-ordinary office supplies opens the door for subjective interpretation.
*   **Impact of prior administrative record:** While the SC rejected length of service as a mitigating factor in this case, it remains a factor in other administrative cases.
*   **Possible challenges based on procedural grounds:** Although unlikely to succeed given the SC's ruling, challenges could be raised based on the process the Ombudsman used in determining administrative liability.

**Legal Advice Note:**

This case highlights the strict application of RA 9184 and the potential severe consequences of non-compliance, even without evidence of corruption. Emphasize to clients the importance of rigorous adherence to procurement procedures, documentation, and proper training for BAC members and other relevant personnel.
