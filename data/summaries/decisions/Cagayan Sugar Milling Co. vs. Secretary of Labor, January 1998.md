## Legal Document Summary: Cagayan Sugar Milling Company vs. Secretary of Labor and Employment

**Case:** *Cagayan Sugar Milling Company vs. Secretary of Labor and Employment*, G.R. No. 128399, January 15, 1998.

**Summary:** This case involves a petition for certiorari filed by Cagayan Sugar Milling Company (CARSUMCO) challenging the Secretary of Labor's decision upholding the Regional Director's finding that CARSUMCO violated Regional Wage Order No. RO2-02. The core issue revolves around the validity and interpretation of RO2-02 and its subsequent amendment, RO2-02-A.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Wage Order RO2-02:** Initially mandated an increase in the *statutory minimum wage rates* in Region II.
*   **Wage Order RO2-02-A:** Subsequently amended RO2-02 to require an *across-the-board wage increase*. Critically, this amendment was made retroactive.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Regional Director initially found CARSUMCO liable for failing to implement an across-the-board increase, resulting in a deficiency of P555,133.41. This liability was upheld by the Secretary of Labor before reaching the Supreme Court

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of RO2-02-A:** The key contention is that RO2-02-A is invalid because it was passed *without the required public consultation, hearings, and newspaper publication* as mandated by Article 123 of the Labor Code.
*   **Interpretation of RO2-02:** The government argues that even the original RO2-02 was intended to mandate an across-the-board increase, despite its explicit wording referring to statutory minimum wage rates. This is a contentious interpretation, and the Court found the original wording clear and unambiguous.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 123 of the Labor Code:** This is the central statutory provision. It outlines the procedural requirements for issuing wage orders, including the need for public consultations, hearings, and publication. Violation of Article 123 renders the Order invalid.
*   **Article 124 (h), Labor Code:** Discusses the factors the wage boards should take into consideration during wage fixing
*   **Wage Order RO2-02:** Original Order setting minimum wage rates.
*   **Wage Order RO2-02-A:** Amended version specifying across-the-board increases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *retroactive application* of RO2-02-A is problematic, especially given the lack of procedural compliance in its enactment.
*   The government's attempt to *re-interpret* the clear language of RO2-02 to align with their understanding of the Board's intent is questionable.
* The Court considered the failure to publish RO2-02-A after its passage

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTS** the petition. The Decision of the Secretary of Labor is **SET ASIDE**. The Court finds that RO2-02-A is invalid due to violations of Article 123 of the Labor Code. CARSUMCO is not liable for violating Wage Order RO2-02 because it complied with the express terms of that order.
