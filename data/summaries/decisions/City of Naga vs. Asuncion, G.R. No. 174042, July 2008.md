Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *City of Naga vs. Hon. Elvi John S. Asuncion, et al.* G.R. No. 174042, July 9, 2008 (579 Phil. 781)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65, assailing the CA's denial of a preliminary prohibitory injunction and the RTC's order for execution pending appeal in an unlawful detainer case.

**Facts:**

*   **Land Dispute:** The heirs of Mariano (Respondents) filed an unlawful detainer action against the City of Naga (Petitioner) for Blocks 25 and 26 of City Heights Subdivision, where the City Hall and public market are located. These lots were initially offered as a donation but were later subject to a sale proposal by the City, which was never formalized.
*   **Procedural History:** MTC dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; RTC reversed, ordering the City to surrender possession, forfeit improvements, and pay monthly compensation of P2,500,000, attorneyâ€™s fees, and costs. The City filed a Motion for Inhibition (denied) and a Petition for Review with the CA, seeking a preliminary injunction, also denied. The RTC then granted execution pending appeal, leading to the issuance of a Writ of Execution, Notice to Vacate, and Notice of Garnishment.

**Key Issues and Ruling:**

1.  **Propriety of Remedy:** The Supreme Court (SC) took cognizance of the Certiorari petition despite the principle of hierarchy of courts, citing the urgent necessity to resolve the question and prevent prejudice to the government.
2.  **Forum-Shopping:** The SC found no forum-shopping, as the certiorari action is independent and aimed at controlling jurisdictional bounds, unlike the Petition for Review that evaluates the case on its merits.
3.  **Execution Pending Appeal:**

    *   **Rule 70, Section 21:** The SC acknowledged that RTC judgments in ejectment cases are immediately executory under Rule 70, Section 21, but stressed the appellate court may stay the said writ should circumstances so require.
    *   **Exceptions:** Citing *Hualam Construction* and *Laurel v. Abalos*, the SC noted exceptions where supervening events or lack of compelling urgency warrant staying immediate execution.
    *   **Preliminary Injunction:** While Section 21 doesn't prevent execution, the losing party can seek a preliminary injunction from the CA (*Benedicto v. CA*).
    *   **CA's Abuse of Discretion:** The SC held that the CA abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction. The denial was premature given the pending motion for execution in the RTC, and the consequences of immediate execution (disruption of essential government services) constituted grave and irreparable injury. The court should have at least deferred resolution until the RTC has decided on the motion for execution pending appeal.

4.  **Garnishment:** The SC invalidated the Notice of Garnishment, citing the rule that government funds are not subject to garnishment absent a corresponding appropriation. *City of Caloocan v. Allarde*.

5.  **Judge's Inhibition:** No grave abuse of discretion in the judge's refusal to inhibit, as mere allegations of bias are insufficient without clear and convincing evidence. *Sarmiento v. Zaratan*.

6.  **Clerk of Court and Sheriff:** No grave abuse of discretion found in the actions of the Clerk of Court and Sheriff, as their actions were ministerial based on the Judge's order.

**Holding:**

The Petition was partly granted. The SC:

*   Reversed the CA's denial of the preliminary injunction.
*   Ordered the CA to issue a writ of preliminary injunction to restrain execution of the RTC decision pending resolution of the petition for review.
*   Set aside the Writ of Execution, Notice to Vacate, and Notice of Garnishment.
*   Enjoined the CA to resolve the pending petition for review without further delay.

**Key Provisions/Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65, Rules of Court (Certiorari and Prohibition)
*   Rule 70, Sections 19 and 21, Rules of Court (Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer, Immediate Execution)
*   Rule 41, Section 1(c) and (f), Rules of Court (Subject of Appeal, Interlocutory order and order of execution)
*   Rule 137, Section 1 (Disqualification of judges)
*   Rule 136, Section 4 (Issuance by clerk of process)
*   Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 10-2000 (Exercise of Utmost Caution, Prudence and Judiciousness in the Issuance of Writs of Execution to Satisfy Money Judgments Against Government Agencies and Local Government Units)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of rent:**  The SC did not explicitly address the reasonableness of the P2,500,000 monthly rental compensation set by the RTC which directs Sangguniang [Panlungsod] of Naga City to immediately appropriate the necessary amount of [P]2,500,000.00 per month representing the unpaid rentals reckoned from November 30, 2003 up to the present from its UNAPPROPRIATED FUNDS to satisfy the claim of the plaintiffs, subject to the existing accounting and auditing rules and regulations.
*   **Resolution on Merits:** The CA is instructed to resolve the pending Petition for Review. The SC's issuance of a preliminary injunction only delays the inevitable if the CA ultimately finds in favor of the respondents on the underlying unlawful detainer action.
*  **Ownership Dispute:** The unlawful detainer hinges on possession, not ownership. However, the underlying claim of the City of Naga's ownership is being brought to a proper judicial proceeding, that being a petition for review before the Court of Appeals under Rule 42.
*   **Future Appropriation:** The need to establish a concrete sale agreement versus the issue of donation of property by the original owners.

This summary should provide a good starting point for further analysis of the case.
