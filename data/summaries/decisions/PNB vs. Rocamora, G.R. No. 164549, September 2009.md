Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Philippine National Bank (PNB) vs. Spouses Agustin and Pilar Rocamora*, G.R. No. 164549, September 18, 2009 (616 Phil. 369)

**Subject Matter:** Propriety of Deficiency Judgment after Foreclosure

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Rocamora obtained a loan of P100,000 from PNB in 1981, secured by real estate and chattel mortgages.
*   The loan agreement contained an escalation clause allowing PNB to increase interest rates.
*   Spouses Rocamora defaulted, and PNB foreclosed the mortgages in 1990, recovering P75,500.
*   PNB filed a complaint for deficiency judgment in 1994, claiming P206,297.47.
*   Spouses Rocamora argued that PNB "created" the deficiency through (a) increasing interest rates from 12% to 42% per annum, and (b) failing to immediately foreclose under PD 385.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Escalation Clause:** PNB argued its right to increase interest rates under the clause, relying on *Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Navarro* (152 SCRA 346) for validity.
*   **PNB's Argument for Valid Escalation Clause:** PNB stated that the promissory note and real estate mortgage contained an escalation clause which reserves the right to increase the interest rate charged on the obligation secured by the mortgage including any amount which it may have advanced within the limits allowed by law at any time depending on whatever policy it may adopt in the future.
*   **Spouses Rocamora's Argument:** The spouses Rocamora argued that PNB failed to call on the Cottage Industry Guarantee and Loan Fund (CIGLF) which secured payment of P65,000 of the loan.
*   **PD 385 (Mandatory Foreclosure Law):** Spouses Rocamora claimed PNB violated PD 385 by delaying foreclosure.
*   **Deficiency Calculation:** Validity of the claimed deficiency amount (P206,297.47) questioned by the spouses Rocamora.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Deficiency Judgment Denied:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA's denial of the deficiency judgment.
*   **Proof of Deficiency Required:** The Court stated that, as in any claim for payment of money, a mortgagee must be able to prove the basis for the deficiency judgment it seeks.
*   **Failure to Prove Amount:** PNB failed to sufficiently prove the amount of the deficiency. The bank's testimonial and documentary evidence contradicted one another.
*   **Unilateral Interest Rate Increases Invalid:** Escalation clauses do not authorize unilateral increases without the debtor's consent, violating the principle of mutuality of contracts (Article 1308, Civil Code). The court cites *PNB v. CA and Ambrosio Padilla*, *PNB v. CA and Jayme-Fernandez*, and *PNB v. CA and Spouses Basco* to reinforce this point.
*   **PD 385 Violation:** PNB's delay in foreclosure (3 years after default) violated PD 385, contributing to the inflated deficiency claim.
*   **Damages Modified:** The Court deleted the award for moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation costs, finding no evidence of fraud, bad faith, or wanton disregard of contractual obligations on PNB's part.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   Act Nos. 1508 & 3135 (Foreclosure Laws)
*   Presidential Decree No. 385 (Mandatory Foreclosure Law)
*   Articles 1142 & 1144(1), Civil Code (Prescription Periods)
*   Article 1308, Civil Code (Mutuality of Contracts)
*   Article 2220, Civil Code (Moral Damages in Contracts)
*   *Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Navarro* (152 SCRA 346) - Validity of escalation clauses
*   *PNB v. CA and Ambrosio Padilla* (196 SCRA 536) - Mutuality of contracts, invalidity of unilateral interest rate increases.
*   *PNB v. CA and Jayme-Fernandez* (238 SCRA 20)
*   *PNB v. CA and Spouses Basco* (258 SCRA 549)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforceability of Escalation Clauses:** The case underscores the risk of relying on broadly worded escalation clauses without securing the debtor's express consent to interest rate increases.
*   **Compliance with PD 385:** Government financial institutions face potential liability and limitations on deficiency claims if they fail to comply with the mandatory foreclosure requirements of PD 385.
*   **Burden of Proof for Deficiency Claims:** Mortgagees bear the burden of providing a clear and credible accounting to support any deficiency claim; otherwise, the claim will likely be denied.
*   **Ambiguity in Deficiency Calculation:** The factual discrepancies in PNB's accounting highlight the importance of meticulous record-keeping and clear evidence when pursuing a deficiency judgment.

**Concise Legal Summary:**

PNB's attempt to recover a deficiency judgment was denied due to its failure to adequately prove the claimed amount, coupled with the invalid unilateral increase of interest rates and violation of mandatory foreclosure requirements under PD 385. The case reaffirms the importance of mutuality in contracts and the limitations on a creditor's power under escalation clauses.
