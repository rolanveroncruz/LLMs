## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Diocado*, G.R. No. 170567

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Conrado Diocado for the crime of rape, defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the appeal and affirmed Diocado's conviction.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Rape of AAA, an 11-year-old girl, on February 7, 1998.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Testimony of the victim (AAA), medical examination confirming loss of virginity with old healed lacerations to the hymen, and corroborating testimony from AAA's sister.
    *   **Defense:** Denial and alibi, corroborated by the testimony of his wife (CCC, AAA's mother), a purported witness (Maria Manlapaz), and a co-worker (Joey Cantojos).
*   **RTC Finding:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Relied heavily on AAA's straightforward testimony and the corroborating medical evidence. Discredited the defense's inconsistent testimonies.
*   **CA Finding:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **SC Holding:** Affirmed the conviction, upholding the lower courts' findings on witness credibility. Emphasized the consistency of AAA's testimony and compatibility with physical evidence. Rejected the defense of denial and alibi due to weaknesses and inconsistencies in the defense's evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Diocado is obligated to serve the sentence of *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   Diocado is liable to pay:
    *   ₱50,000.00 as civil indemnity
    *   ₱50,000.00 for moral damages
    *   ₱25,000.00 as exemplary damages (increased from ₱10,000.00 by the SC)
    *   Costs of the proceedings

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The primary contention revolves around the credibility of AAA's testimony versus the defendant's alibi and his wife's contradictory testimony. The defense argued the lack of shouting and discrepancies in the testimony.
*   **Age of Victim:** While the victim's age (11) was established, the information failed to indicate that Diocado was the common-law spouse of the victim's mother. Had this circumstance been included in the information, the death penalty could have been considered as the penalty.
*   **Evidentiary Scrutiny:** The SC explicitly acknowledged the heightened scrutiny needed in rape cases, particularly those involving minors.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines.
*   **Republic Act No. 7610 & 9262:** Laws protecting children and women from abuse.
*   **Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Provides that the minority of the complainant and her filiation with the accused or the fact that the accused was the common-law spouse of her parent must be alleged in the Information.
*   **Case Law:** The decision references settled SC jurisprudence regarding witness credibility, the evaluation of evidence in rape cases, the weakness of alibi defenses, and the automatic award of moral damages.
*   **Article 14, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended:** Provided grounds for the award of exemplary damages.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The disagreement over the timeline of events on the day of the crime and the alleged discrepancies in AAA's testimony.
*   The shifting testimonies of CCC, leading to questions about her credibility and potential bias towards her husband.

**Overall Assessment:**

The conviction was upheld due to the strong and credible testimony of the victim, supported by medical evidence, despite the defendant's alibi and the questionable testimony of his witnesses. The decision highlights the SC's deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, particularly in rape cases.
