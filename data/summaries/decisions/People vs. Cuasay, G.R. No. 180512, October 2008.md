**Case Summary: *People v. Cuasay*, G.R. No. 180512, October 17, 2008**

**Nature:** Appeal from CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Noel Cuasay for murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659).

**Facts:** Cuasay stabbed Eduardo Ansuli at a wake. Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony. Cuasay claimed self-defense.

**Holding:** CA decision affirmed with modification. Cuasay found guilty of murder with treachery.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Conviction for Murder:** Cuasay found guilty of murder due to the presence of treachery, rejecting the defenses of self-defense and passion/obfuscation. This carries a penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** The Court ordered Cuasay to pay the heirs of Eduardo Ansuli:
    *   P50,000 as civil indemnity
    *   P25,000 as exemplary damages (due to treachery)
    *   P50,000 as moral damages (added by SC, overturning CA deletion).

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability:  Imprisonment for life (*reclusion perpetua*).
*   Civil Liability: Significant monetary damages to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim:** Cuasay's self-defense claim hinged on his testimony of unlawful aggression by the victim. The court found his testimony incredible, lacking corroboration and contradicted by the natural reactions of bystanders.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The qualifying circumstance of treachery was successfully established by the prosecution. The sudden and unexpected nature of the attack on an unarmed victim precluded any meaningful defense, negating a claim of spontaneous or provoked violence.
*   **Mitigating Circumstance of Passion/Obfuscation:** Court rejected this, stating there was no act on the part of the victim that caused the accused to act with passion.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The case largely turned on the credibility of the prosecution's eyewitness versus the accused's self-serving testimony. The court gave significant weight to the trial court's factual findings on witness credibility, adhering to the principle of deference to the lower court's assessment.
