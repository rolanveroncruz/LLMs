**Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Cornelio Joel I. Orden and Maria Nympha V. Orden vs. Sps. Arturo Aurea and Melodia C. Aurea, Sps. Ernesto P. Cobile and Susana M. Cobile, and Franklin M. Quijano* (G.R. No. 172733, August 20, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court ruling regarding a real property transaction.

**Key Issue:** Whether the contract between Petitioners (Ordens) and Respondents (Cobiles, through Aureas) was a *contract of sale* or a *contract to sell*. This determination dictates the remedies available and the obligations of the parties.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:**  Executed by Ordens in favor of Aureas. Contains a recital that the full purchase price of P1.9M was received.
*   **Joint Affidavit:**  Aureas declare they are acting as nominees for the Cobiles, who are the true purchasers.  This raises issues regarding *simulated contracts* and potential *circumvention of land ownership restrictions* for foreign citizens (at the time), though Cobiles were allegedly former Filipino Citizens.
*   **Promissory Note:** Executed by Cobiles, promising to pay P566,000 by a specific date and the remaining P950,000 upon transfer of title. The Court uses this as critical evidence to analyze the *intention of the parties*.
*   **Receipts:** Document partial payments made by Cobiles totaling P738,596.28.
*   **Letter of Intent to Sell:**  Orden's letter to Cobile notifying them of intent to sell to others if payment is not received in 10 days, promising reimbursement less damages and attorney's fees.

**Obligations:**

*   **Ordens:** Originally obligated to transfer title upon full payment. Now obligated to return P738,596.28 plus 12% interest from 09/30/1997.
*   **Cobiles:** Originally obligated to pay P1.9M. Now obligated to pay moral damages (P50,000) and attorney's fees (P20,000).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Ordens:**  Liable for refund and interest.
*   **Cobiles:** Liable for damages and attorney's fees for causing the troubles, having failed to pay the balance of the purchase price.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Simulated Contract/Circumvention:**  The use of the Aurea's name as a means to acquire land by American Citizens could have involved certain tax implications that can be disputed.
*   **Interpretation of "Deed of Absolute Sale" vs. "Contract to Sell":** Despite the deed's title, the Court found it to be a contract to sell based on the promissory note and conduct of the parties. This highlights the importance of substance over form. *Escueta v. Lim* (G.R. No. 137162) is cited regarding this principle.
*   **Rescission:** The Court notes that formal rescission (judicial or notarial) was *not* required because the contract was a "contract to sell" and the suspensive condition (full payment) was not met. *Ayala Life Assurance, Inc. v. Ray Burton Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 163075) is cited. This is because of the *reciprocity of the transaction*.
*   **Third Party Rights:** Subsequent sale to Houthuijzens, deemed buyers in good faith, further complicates specific performance.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The court notes the issue of unjust enrichment is in play, if the full balance of the purchase price is not returned.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1191, Civil Code:**  Discussed regarding the remedy of rescission. The Court clarifies this is *inapplicable* to a "contract to sell" where the condition precedent was not met.
*   **Article 1592, Civil Code:**  Relating to rescission in sales of immovable property. Found *inapplicable* here as this was a Contract to Sell.
*   **Serrano v. Caguiat (G.R. No. 139173):**  Cited for the definition of a conditional sale, noting that the suspension is the full payment of the purchase price.
*   **Demafelis v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 152164):**  Cited for the comparison of a contract to sell to a conditional sale.
*   **Torrecampo v. Alindogan, Sr. (G.R. No. 156405):**  Cited as well for the definition of a conditional sale with suspension of purchase price.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately found that the transaction was a "contract to sell" and not a "contract of sale," therefore the Petitioners (Ordens) have no obligation to transfer property. The ruling hinges on the interpretation of the promissory note and actions by the parties. While Ordens are allowed to sell to third-party, they were ordered to reimburse the partial payments made by Cobiles. The Court also awarded moral damages and attorney's fees to Ordens.
