**Legal Document Summary: People v. Salaver**

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 223681, August 20, 2018 (839 Phil. 90)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Joint Decision finding Benjamin Salaver guilty of three counts of qualified rape under Article 266-A, paragraph (1) and Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 8353.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Qualified Rape Definition:** Carnal knowledge of a woman under 18 years of age by a parent, ascendant, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.
*   **Elements of Qualified Rape:** (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under [eighteen] years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) of the victim
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua due to R.A. 9346 (prohibition of the death penalty), despite Article 266-B providing for the death penalty.

**Factual Background:** Accused was charged with three counts of rape of his 15-year-old daughter (AAA) within their shared household. The incidents allegedly occurred in July, August, and September 2006. Evidence included testimony from the victim (AAA), medical evidence (Dr. Legaspi), and testimony from the victim’s brother (BBB). The accused denied the charges.

**Key Arguments on Appeal:**

*   Victim's behavior (continuing to live with the accused, delayed reporting) inconsistent with rape.
*   Inconsistencies in the victim's testimony regarding reporting the first incident.
*   Lack of physical injuries and resistance.
*   Claims of manipulation by the victim's uncle (EEE) due to a grudge.

**Court's Holding:**

*   Affirmed the CA decision finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
*   Victim’s testimony was found to be credible and straightforward.
*   Victim's actions are not considered unusual, considering that it was in light of her age and relationship with the accused.
*   Minor inconsistencies in testimony were deemed trivial and "badges of truth."
*   Moral ascendancy of the father substitutes for force or intimidation.
*   Victim's delay in reporting explained by fear and the accused’s authority.
*   Medical evidence (healed lacerations) corroborated the rape.
*   Defense of denial and improper motive insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence.

**Damages Awarded (Modified by SC):**

*   Civil indemnity: P100,000.00 per count (total P300,000)
*   Moral damages: P100,000.00 per count (total P300,000)
*   Exemplary damages: P100,000.00 per count (total P300,000)
*   Interest: 6% per annum on all damages from finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The conviction hinges heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony, particularly the absence of immediate reporting and lack of initial physical resistance. While the court addresses these points using established jurisprudence relating to child victims and moral authority of the father, these remain points of potential contention if further appeals are pursued.
*   The lack of eligibility for parole, although standard in *reclusion perpetua* cases, represents a significant long-term consequence for the accused.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None are explicitly apparent from the document. However, as stated above, the potential weakness comes from the heavy reliance of credibility due to the lack of some tangible evidence to corroborate.
