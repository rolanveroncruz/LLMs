**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dela Cruz***

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Ranilo Dela Cruz y Lizing*, G.R. No. 177222, October 29, 2008 (591 Phil. 259).

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Ranilo Dela Cruz for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically the sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165:** The appellant was charged with, and initially convicted of, selling 0.03 grams of shabu to a poseur-buyer.

*   **Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 Non-Compliance:** The primary issue is the failure of the arresting officers to comply with the mandatory chain of custody requirements outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). The inventory and photographing of the seized drugs were not conducted immediately after seizure in the presence of the accused or his representatives, a media representative, a DOJ representative, or an elected official. *See People v. Orteza, People v. Nazareno, People v. Santos, Jr.* for examples of cases emphasizing compliance.

*   **Chain of Custody:** The marking of the sachet with the initial "BP" (arresting officer Braulio Peregrino) at the police station was insufficient, especially without mandated witnesses. The prosecution failed to demonstrate a clear chain of custody. Forensic Chemist examined without accused presence.

*   **IRR Proviso:** The prosecution attempted to invoke the proviso in the IRR of Section 21(a) of R.A. No. 9165, arguing that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved. The Court rejected this argument because the prosecution failed to provide evidence of justifiable grounds for non-compliance or proof that the integrity of the evidence was, in fact, preserved.

*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The Court emphasized the constitutional presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution's failure to adhere to the prescribed procedures created reasonable doubt. *See People v. Uy*.

*   **PDEA Coordination (Section 86, R.A. No. 9165):** While the buy-bust operation was conducted without PDEA involvement, the Court acknowledged that at the time (September 12, 2002), the mandatory integration of drug enforcement units into PDEA had not yet taken effect (within 18 months from July 4, 2002 effectivity).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The *prosecution* bears the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing the elements of the offense and a clear chain of custody for the seized drugs.

*   *Law enforcement officers* have a mandatory obligation to comply strictly with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its IRR to ensure the integrity and admissibility of seized evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The Proviso in the IRR of Section 21(a) of R.A. No. 9165:** This proviso, allowing for non-compliance under justifiable grounds if integrity is preserved, is often invoked by the prosecution, potentially circumventing the strict requirements of the law. However, this case emphasizes that the prosecution *must* provide evidence to support the application of the proviso, not merely assert it. *See Justice Brion's Dissenting Opinion in People v. Agulay*.

*   **Discretion in Determining "Justifiable Grounds":** The interpretation of "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21 can be contentious. The court requires specific and compelling reasons, not mere oversight or negligence.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and RTC decisions, acquitting Ranilo Dela Cruz on the ground of reasonable doubt.

**Implications:**

This case reinforces the strict interpretation and application of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165. It serves as a reminder that failure to comply with mandatory chain of custody requirements, without valid justification and proof of preserved integrity, will likely result in the inadmissibility of evidence and acquittal of the accused.
