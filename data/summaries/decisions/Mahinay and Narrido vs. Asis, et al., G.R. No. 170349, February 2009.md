## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Mahinay vs. Hon. Asis* and *Sps. Narrido vs. Hon. Asis* (G.R. No. 170349, February 12, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's order of execution granting possession of disputed land.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC, in executing a CA decision that only remanded the case for damage assessment, could validly order the Sheriff to place private respondents in possession of the subject land.

**Ruling:** SC held that the RTC erred. The writ of execution must conform to the dispositive portion of the decision being executed. Since the CA decision (modified on appeal) did NOT award possession to the private respondents, the RTC's order to place them in possession exceeded the scope of the CA judgment and was therefore invalid.  The CA erroneously affirmed this order.

**Facts:**

*   **Original Cases:** Respondents (Velasquez group) filed suits (B-0647 & B-0682) against Petitioners (Mahinay & Narrido Sps.) to recover possession of land, claiming ownership based on titles.
*   **Reversion Cases:** Subsequently, the Republic filed cases (B-0735 to B-0746) to cancel Respondents' titles and revert the land to public domain.
*   **Initial Judgments:** RTC initially ruled in favor of Respondents in possession cases and dismissed the reversion cases.
*   **Appeals:** Petitioners appealed possession cases; the State appealed reversion cases. Proceedings in possession cases were suspended pending resolution of the reversion cases.
*   **Reversal in Reversion Cases:** CA reversed the RTC in the reversion cases, declaring the land public forest and titles null. This became final after SC denied the Petition due to filing out of time.
*   **CA Decision in Possession Cases:** CA recognized State's ownership. While finding respondents not to be the owners of the land the CA declared Respondents better entitled to possession and remanded the case for damages due to dispossession.
*   **RTC Order on Remand:** RTC, interpreting a CA Resolution (April 11, 2002), ordered the sheriff to put Respondents in possession, claiming the CA had modified its stance, and that the respondents were the registered owners.
*   **CA Affirmance:** The CA affirmed this RTC order (June 6, 2005).
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed the CA's affirmation of the RTC's order awarding possession.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   The court reiterated that a Writ of Execution must conform to the decision being executed.
*   **Obligation:** The RTC has a *ministerial duty* to carry out the final and executory decision of the appellate court.
*   **Obligation:** The RTC has jurisdiction to address the determination of expenses (as directed by the CA’s Resolution dated June 6, 2004) with the permanent writ of preliminary injunction set aside.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Liability:** Petitioners could be liable for damages determined by the RTC.
*   **Risk:** The decision regarding possession *does not* preclude the State from taking action to recover the land as owner. The petitioners remain at risk of action from the State. The respondents run a substantial risk, given that their titles were null and void.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court (Rule 45):** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Perez v. Evite, Tiro v. Court of Appeals, Baluyut v. Guiao:** Cases cited by the lower courts to support the awarding of possession even without an explicit order in the decision.  However, the SC distinguished these cases, noting that they involved ownership disputes, whereas the CA decision recognized State ownership.
*   **Ex-Bataan Veteran Security Agency, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, Equatorial Realty Development, Inc. v. Mayfair Theater, Inc., Philippine Veterans Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals:** Cases cited by the SC to underscore that the writ of execution must conform strictly to every essential particular of the judgment promulgated.
*   **Art. 1477, Civil Code:** Not applicable to the case at bar as titles were ruled null.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's initial decision finding the respondents "better entitled to possession" while acknowledging State ownership created the ambiguity leading to the RTC's erroneous interpretation.
* The RTC’s interpretation of the April 11, 2002 Resolution as a “modification” of the CA's stand on the issue of possession.

**Potential Arguments:**

* Respondents might attempt to argue for "better right of possession" based on prior occupation and improvements, however, given the land has been declared public domain, this would not be sufficient.
* Given the protracted nature of the litigation, the respondents might attempt to rely on principles of equity; however, the SC has clearly stated that since the land is owned by the State they have no right to claim its return.

**Conclusion:**

The SC correctly reversed the CA's decision affirming the RTC's order to deliver possession. The key takeaway is that the RTC exceeded its authority by ordering a relief (possession) not granted in the CA's final judgment. The petitioners should proceed with caution in light of the outstanding debt. The respondents should proceed with caution given that the state may at any point, take the appropriate action for the reclamation of its inalienable land.
