## Legal Document Summary: *Tabigue v. International Copra Export Corporation (INTERCO)*, G.R. No. 183335 (2009)

**Nature of the Case:** This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Review regarding a decision by the NCMB Director. The core issue is whether individual employees, not authorized by their union, can compel INTERCO to submit to voluntary arbitration based on a CBA.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **CBA & Grievance Procedure:** The CBA between INTERCO and the Union contains a grievance procedure culminating in voluntary arbitration if conciliation fails. Crucially, the CBA stipulates that the Union and the Company submit issues to Voluntary Arbitration.
*   **Union Authorization:** The Union President (Tan) informed INTERCO that the petitioning employees were *not* authorized to represent the Union in the dispute. This is the central point of contention.
*   **NCMB Director's Role:** The NCMB Director refused to order voluntary arbitration, citing the lack of willingness from both parties (given the Union's disavowal) and the Union's status as an indispensable party. The NCMB position is that they only facilitate settlement and cannot decide on the issues.
*   **Right to Present Grievances (Art. 255, Labor Code):** The petitioners argue that Article 255 of the Labor Code provides an exception to the union's exclusive representation, allowing individual employees to present grievances.
*   **Rule 43 Issues:** The CA initially dismissed based on procedural grounds (insufficient payment of docket fees, improperly certified document, incomplete verification).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **INTERCO's Obligation:** Under the CBA, INTERCO is obligated to participate in voluntary arbitration if a dispute arises and the union authorizes such action. This obligation is contingent on the Union's authorization.
*   **Union's Role:** The union has the obligation to represent its members fairly and to authorize representation in grievance procedures and voluntary arbitration.
*   **Employees' Obligation:** As members of the Union, the petitioners are obligated to respect the Union's authority and representation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in CBA Clause:** There's potential ambiguity in the CBA's language regarding whether individual employees can initiate voluntary arbitration. The court interprets it to require Union authorization.
*   **Risk of Split Representation:** The case highlights the risk of conflicting interests between the Union and a group of dissenting employees.
*   **Impact on CBA Enforcement:** The decision underscores the importance of clear authorization procedures within unions to avoid challenges to CBA enforcement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 255:** Discusses the union's exclusive representation but also mentions an individual's right to present grievances.  The Court interprets this to *not* extend to the right to compel voluntary arbitration.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 260:** Discusses the need for parties to a CBA to designate their respective representatives to the grievance machinery and voluntary arbitrators.
*   ***Atlas Farms, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 440 Phil. 620 (2002):**  Cited by the Court to emphasize that only disputes involving the Union and the Company shall be referred to the grievance machinery or voluntary arbitrators.
*   **Executive Order No. 126, Section 22:**  Enumerates the functions of the NCMB, highlighting its role as a conciliatory body rather than a quasi-judicial agency.
*   **Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980 (Batas Pambansa Blg. 129), Section 9(3):** Defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Court:** Outlines the procedure for appealing decisions of quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's dismissal, finding that the petitioning employees lacked the authority to compel INTERCO to submit to voluntary arbitration under the CBA.  The Court emphasized the Union's role as the exclusive bargaining representative and the requirement for Union authorization to initiate arbitration.  The decision reinforces the importance of adhering to procedural rules and respecting the Union's representation rights in CBA enforcement. This case sets a precedent that individual employees must seek recourse for their grievances through their union representative and cannot act independently to bind the union.
