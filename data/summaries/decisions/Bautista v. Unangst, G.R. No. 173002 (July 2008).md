## Legal Document Summary: Bautista v. Unangst, G.R. No. 173002 (2008)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase should be construed as an equitable mortgage.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase was indeed an equitable mortgage.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Bautista):**  Sought specific performance, recovery of possession, consolidation of ownership, and damages based on the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase. Was the creditor in an agreement securing amounts owed from car rentals and a mortgage paid out.
*   **Respondent (Unangst):**  Vendor in the Deed of Sale with Right to Repurchase. Alleged duress, simulation, and argued the contract was an equitable mortgage.

**Key Factors leading to Equitable Mortgage Determination:**

*   **Article 1602 of the Civil Code:**  The Court relied heavily on this article to establish circumstances under which a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase is presumed to be an equitable mortgage.
*   **Circumstances surrounding the transaction:**
    *   **Financial Distress:** The respondent was under police custody and urgently needed funds.  The court cited jurisprudence emphasizing that "necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men."
    *   **Continued Possession:** The respondent retained possession of the property, inconsistent with a genuine sale.
    *   **Debt as Consideration:** The "purchase price" reflected the existing debts (car rental and mortgage payment).
    * **Art. 1602(6):**  The court found it fairly inferrable that the real intention of the parties was to secure the payment of a debt.
    * **Usury Considerations:** The Court invoked the provision which regards benefits received under the contract as rent or interest, subject to usury laws.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent's liability is tied to the secured debt, not an absolute sale.  The SC did not detail the extent of the debt.
*   Petitioner potentially exposed to usury claims.

**Potential Risks for Petitioner:**

*   **Usury Claims:**  Potential for respondent to claim that the benefits received by the petitioner under the sale with right to repurchase actually constitute interest that exceed the legal limit.
*   **Foreclosure Restrictions:**  As an equitable mortgage, the petitioner must initiate foreclosure proceedings, not simply consolidate ownership.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1602:**  Principal basis for the ruling (presumption of equitable mortgage).
*   **Civil Code Article 1603:** "In case of doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase shall be construed as an equitable mortgage."
*   **Civil Code Article 1607** Relief against transfer
*   **Lorbes v. Court of Appeals, 351 SCRA 716 (2001):** Intention of Parties
*   **Ramos v. Court of Appeals, 180 SCRA 635 (1989):** Deed as Security of Loan.
*   **Legaspi v. Ong, 459 SCRA 122 (2005):** Surrounding Circumstances
*   **Numerous supporting cases:** Cited to reinforce the principles of equitable mortgage, duress, and interpretation of contracts.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The document itself does not contain specific ambiguous clauses. The ambiguity arose from the *circumstances* surrounding the contract, leading the court to disregard the literal terms.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Court addressed procedural issues regarding the late payment of docket fees, excusing it due to the Clerk of Court's initial misassessment and the respondent's subsequent correction.  The court cited *Meatmasters International Corporation v. Lelis Integrated Development Corporation, 452 SCRA 626 [2005]* and other related cases.
*   The decision emphasizes the court's inclination to construe doubtful contracts as equitable mortgages to prevent circumvention of usury laws and pactum commissorium.
