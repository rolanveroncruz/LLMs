**Case Summary: *Felix Rait v. The People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 180425 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging CA decision affirming RTC conviction for attempted rape under Article 335 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Petitioner Rait convicted of attempted rape of AAA. The prosecution alleged that Rait and a co-accused intoxicated AAA, removed her pants and underwear, and Rait inserted his finger into her vagina. He was prevented from further penetration by AAA kicking him and escaping.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Article 6, Revised Penal Code:** Defines attempted felonies. The elements of attempted rape are the commencement of the crime by overt acts, and failure to perform all acts of execution due to a cause other than voluntary desistance.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:**  The Court applied this, resulting in a minimum and maximum sentence.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner Rait was found guilty of attempted rape.
*   Sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of two (2) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of *prision correccional* medium, as minimum, to ten (10) years of *prision mayor* medium, as its maximum.
*   Ordered to pay complainant P20,000 as indemnity, P5,000 for actual damages and expenses, and costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Issue of Intent:** The defense argued that the acts did not definitively prove intent to commit rape, relying on *Baleros, Jr. v. People*. The SC distinguished *Baleros*, holding that Rait's actions (removing clothing, vaginal penetration with finger) sufficiently demonstrated the requisite intent. This highlights the importance of establishing *mens rea* through overt acts directly related to the intended crime.
*   **Degree of Penetration:** The judgment hinges on the credibility of the victim's testimony and the determination that the insertion of a finger constitutes a sufficient overt act to establish attempted rape. This is a fact-specific determination.
*   **Ambiguity in Original Sentence:** The RTC's original sentencing was ambiguous, and the Supreme Court clarified to include specific periods of the minimum and maximum.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 6 & 335:** The core legal basis for the attempted rape conviction.
*   ***Baleros, Jr. v. People*, G.R. No. 138033 (2006):** The defense cited this case where the Supreme Court reduced attempted rape to light coercion. The Supreme Court distinguished this case from *Rait* based on the nature of the overt acts.  *Baleros* clarifies that acts must have a "logical connection to a particular, concrete offense."  Absent clear intent for rape, other offenses may apply.
*   **People v. Mendoza, G.R. Nos. 152589 & 152758, January 31, 2005, 450 SCRA 328, 334**: Defining an "overt act" as some physical activity or deed, indicating the intention to commit a particular crime, more than a mere planning or preparation, which if carried out to its complete termination following its natural course, without being frustrated by external obstacles nor by the spontaneous desistance of the perpetrator, will logically and necessarily ripen into a concrete offense.
*   **People v. Lizada, 396 SCRA 62 (2003):**  Cited in relation to defining an "overt act" and the necessary causal relation to the intended crime.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Governing the imposition of penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262:** Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision and affirmed Rait's conviction for attempted rape. The decision hinges on the specific factual findings, differentiating this case from *Baleros*, and emphasizing the overt acts of removing clothing and vaginal penetration as sufficient to demonstrate intent to commit rape. The SC underscored that factual findings of the trial court when affirmed by the CA are binding on the Supreme Court.
