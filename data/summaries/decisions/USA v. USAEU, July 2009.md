**Legal Document Summary: *University of San Agustin v. University of San Agustin Employees Union-FFW***

**Document:** G.R. No. 177594, July 23, 2009 (611 Phil. 258)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding interpretation of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) provision related to tuition fee incremental proceeds (TIP).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 3 of CBA:** Stipulates salary increases for SY 2001-2002 and 2002-2003 as "P1,500.00 per month or 80% of the TIP, whichever is higher, across the board." This is the central point of contention.

**Obligations:**

*   **University (Petitioner):** Obligated to provide salary increases according to the CBA's interpretation.
*   **Union (Respondent):** Entitled to salary increases as defined by the CBA, specifically 80% of TIP or P1500, whichever is higher.
*   The law sets a minimum, not maximum percentage.

**Liabilities:**

*   The University is potentially liable for underpayment of salaries if the CBA provision is interpreted to mean 80% of TIP exclusively for salary increases.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Strain:** Strict adherence to the CBA as interpreted by the appellate court could place a greater financial burden on the University, potentially impacting its ability to allocate funds for other institutional needs.
*   **Future CBA Negotiations:** This case sets a precedent for future negotiations, potentially limiting the University's ability to negotiate favorable terms regarding TIP allocation.
*   **Labor Unrest:** Failure to comply with the court's interpretation could lead to further disputes and labor unrest.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6728 (The Tuition Fee Law):** Specifically Section 5(2) which mandates that 70% of TIP should be set aside for employees' salaries, allowances, and other benefits. The University argues the CA's interpretation violates this provision.
*   **Cebu Institute of Medicine v. Cebu Institute of Medicine Employees' Union-NFL (G.R. No. 141285):** Cited by the University to support its argument that benefits beyond salaries can be sourced from the 70% mandated by R.A. 6728. The court distinguishes this case because it was in the absence of a CBA between the parties, unlike the present case.
*   **St. John Colleges, Inc., vs. St. John Academy Faculty and Employees' Union (G.R. No. 167892):** Illustrates unfair labor practices for not adhering to CBA.
*   **Centro Escolar University Faculty and Allied Workers Union-Independent v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 165486):** Differentiated by the court due to different factual setting.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1370:** Principle that clear contract terms should be literally interpreted.
*   **Labor Code, Article 252:** States that no party is compelled to agree to a proposal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "salary increases" in Article VIII, Section 3 of the CBA. The Union contends it refers *only* to salary increases, while the University argues it encompasses all employee benefits.
*   Whether scholarship grants and tuition fee discounts should be deducted from the TIP before calculating the 80% allocation for salary increases. Although the CA ruled that this is a valid deduction, the University wanted the intrepretation of "salary increase" changed.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **University:** The interpretation requiring 80% of TIP *solely* for salary increases violates RA 6728 and is financially unsustainable.
*   **Union:** The CBA language is clear and unambiguous; the University knowingly and voluntarily agreed to allocate 80% of the TIP for salary increases alone.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals decision, siding with the Union's interpretation. The University is bound by the CBA, and its remedy lies in future negotiations.
