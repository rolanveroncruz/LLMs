**Case Summary: Gregorio Destreza vs. Atty. Ma. Gracia Ri単oza-Plazo and Ma. Fe Alaras, G.R. No. 176863, October 30, 2009**

**Key Issue:** Validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the late Pedro Ri単oza in favor of Gregorio Destreza, and the subsequent Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT 55396) issued in Destreza's name.

**Facts:** Ri単oza's heirs (Respondents) sought to nullify the Deed of Sale and TCT 55396, claiming irregularities. Destreza claimed he purchased the land in 1989. The RTC initially nullified the Deed of Sale and TCT 55396 but ordered Ri単oza's estate to reimburse Destreza. The Court of Appeals affirmed the nullification but removed the reimbursement obligation.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the Court of Appeals, upholding the validity of the Deed of Sale and ordering the registration of TCT 55396 in Destreza's name.

**Key Provisions & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Notarized Deed of Sale:** The SC held that a notarized deed of sale is a public document entitled to full faith and credit. The failure of the notary public to submit a report to the RTC notarial section does not invalidate the deed. See *Gonzales v. Ramos, 499 Phil. 345, 350 (2005)*.
*   **Presumption of Due Execution:** Every instrument duly acknowledged and certified is admissible as evidence without further proof. The certificate of acknowledgment is prima facie evidence of the instrument's execution. (Rule 132, Sec. 30, Rules of Court). *Dela Cruz v. Spouses Sison, 492 Phil. 139, 146 (2005)* states there must be clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity of a notarized document.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof lies on the party challenging the validity of the notarized deed (Respondents). An allegation of fraud requires clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity.
*   **Registration:**  Premature release of a copy of the title cannot affect the validity of the contract of sale. Registration is only the operative act to convey or affect the land as to third persons and does not affect the contract between the buyer and seller. (Presidential Decree No. 1529, Sec. 51, 57).

**Obligations:**

*   Destreza: Obligation to comply with any remaining registration requirements to obtain the duplicate TCT.
*   Register of Deeds: Obligated to register TCT 55396 upon Destreza's compliance with registration requirements.

**Liabilities:** No liabilities were ultimately assessed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancy in Purchase Price:** The difference between the stated price in the Deed of Sale (P60,000) and Destreza's testimony (P100,000) could have been a contentious point but was not successfully leveraged by the Respondents. It highlights the importance of consistent evidence.
*   **Premature Release of TCT:** The fact that Destreza may have obtained a copy of TCT 55396 before its official entry in the registry books created a potential ambiguity. However, the SC considered this a minor irregularity that did not invalidate the sale.
*   **Evidence Reliance** Reliance was placed on the notarized deed of sale. However, there was also a reliance on circumstantial evidence such as open possession to infer intent and validity of the sale.
*   **PD 1529 Sec. 51** - highlights that the operative act of registering the deed is a requirement for the creation of new rights, and affecting third parties.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sections 51 & 57
*   Rules of Court, Rules 131 & 132

**Case Law:**

*   Gonzales v. Ramos, 499 Phil. 345, 350 (2005)
*   Dela Cruz v. Spouses Sison, 492 Phil. 139, 146 (2005)
*   Ceballos v. Intestate Estate of the Late Emigdio Mercado, G.R. No. 155856, May 28, 2004, 430 SCRA 323, 335.
*   Doctrine that Registration only binds third persons and is not a requirement for the validity of the contract between parties.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court gave significant weight to the notarized deed of sale and the presumption of its due execution. Respondents failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to overcome this presumption and invalidate the sale. The case emphasizes the importance of meticulously documented evidence and a sound understanding of burden of proof.
