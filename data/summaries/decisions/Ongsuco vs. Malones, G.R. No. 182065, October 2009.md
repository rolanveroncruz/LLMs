Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Ongsuco and Salaya v. Malones*, G.R. No. 182065, October 27, 2009 (619 Phil. 492)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the RTC's dismissal of a special civil action for Mandamus/Prohibition.

**Facts:** Petitioners, market stallholders in Maasin, Iloilo, challenged the validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 98-01, which increased stall rentals and imposed "goodwill fees." They alleged the ordinance was invalid due to lack of proper prior public hearing as required under Section 186 of the Local Government Code (LGC) and its implementing rules. The Mayor (Respondent) maintained the ordinance's validity, claiming no hearing was needed, and argued petitioners were illegally occupying stalls. The RTC and CA dismissed the petition, citing non-exhaustion of administrative remedies (appeal to the Secretary of Justice per Section 187 of the LGC) and the impropriety of Prohibition/Mandamus.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA and RTC, declaring Municipal Ordinance No. 98-01 *void* and *ineffective*, and issuing a writ of prohibition against its enforcement. It also declared the Petitioners as lawful occupants of the market stalls.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Municipal Ordinance No. 98-01:** The central issue is the ordinance's validity, specifically regarding the imposition of increased rentals and goodwill fees.
*   **Public Hearing Requirement (Section 186 LGC):** The SC focused on the requirement of a *prior* public hearing before enacting ordinances levying taxes, fees, or charges. It found that the five-day notice period for the initial public hearing was insufficient under Article 277(b)(3) of the LGC's Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), requiring at least ten days. The subsequent hearing *after* enactment did not cure the defect.
*   **Definition of "Charges"**: The Court classified the increased rentals and "goodwill fees" as "charges" under Article 221(g) of the LGC.
*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies (Section 187 LGC):** The SC held that exhaustion of administrative remedies (appeal to the Secretary of Justice) was *not* required because the issue was a *pure question of law* (validity of the ordinance), falling within the court's competence and jurisdiction. Cites *J.M. Tuason and Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, *Ynot v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, and *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Santos*.
*   **Propriety of Prohibition:** While the lower courts deemed prohibition improper, the SC found the Respondent was performing a ministerial function, which is subject to prohibition. Section 444 of the LGC places a duty on the Mayor to implement the Municipal ordinances. It ruled that the remedy of prohibition was the appropriate action.
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The SC defined a "ministerial function" as one performed in a prescribed manner, without discretion regarding propriety. Implementing a valid ordinance is ministerial.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991:** Sections 16, 22, 186, 187, 219, 221, 444
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of the LGC:** Article 276, 277
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65, Sections 2 and 3
*   **Philippine Constitution:** Article VIII, Section 5
*   *J.M. Tuason and Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 113 Phil. 673 (1961)
*   *Ynot v. Intermediate Appellate Court*, 232 Phil. 615 (1987)
*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Santos*, 343 Phil. 411 (1997)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Public Hearing":** The ruling underscores the strict interpretation of the procedural requirements for enacting local tax ordinances and revenue measures. Any deviation, even perceived minor ones, can render the ordinance void.
*   **Application of Exhaustion Doctrine:** The case clarifies an exception to the exhaustion doctrine when a purely legal question is at issue, specifically the validity of an ordinance.
*   **Definition of 'Ministerial Duty':** The Court's characterization of the mayor's implementation of the ordinance as a ministerial duty further allows for prohibition to prevent implementation of an invalid ordinance.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Municipality of Maasin is obligated to cease enforcement of Municipal Ordinance No. 98-01.
*   The Mayor is subject to a writ of prohibition and cannot enforce the ordinance.
*   The Petitioners are entitled to lawful occupancy and may recover possession of their market stalls if dispossessed.
