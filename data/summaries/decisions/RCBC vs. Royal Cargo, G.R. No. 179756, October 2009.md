## Legal Document Summary: RCBC vs. Royal Cargo Corp. (G.R. No. 179756)

**Case Overview:** This Supreme Court case involves a dispute between RCBC (petitioner), a secured creditor via a chattel mortgage, and Royal Cargo Corporation (respondent), a judgment creditor with an attachment over some of the same personal properties of Terrymanila, Inc. (debtor). RCBC extrajudicially foreclosed on its chattel mortgage after Terrymanila was declared insolvent. Royal Cargo sued to annul the auction sale, alleging lack of proper notice per Section 14 of the Chattel Mortgage Law (Act No. 1508).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 14, Chattel Mortgage Law:** This section requires the mortgagee to notify the mortgagor and persons holding subsequent mortgages of the time and place of sale, either by notice in writing directed to him or left at his abode, if within the municipality, or sent by mail if he does not reside in such municipality, at least ten days previous to the date.
*   **Section 13, Chattel Mortgage Law:** Allows a mortgagor, subsequent mortgagee, or subsequent attaching creditor to redeem the mortgaged property before the sale by paying the amount due.
*   **Article 2244, Civil Code:** Lists preferred credits, including credits in a public instrument or final judgment.

**Obligations:**

*   **RCBC (Mortgagee):** Had an obligation to provide proper notice of the foreclosure sale to parties with an interest in the property, particularly those with a right of redemption. While no statutory obligation to notify attaching creditors under Section 14 of Act No. 1508 exists, the court finds the Respondent was entitled to notice of the sale due to their existing equity of redemption, but, however, the failure to receive the ten day notice did not impact Respondent's decision not to redeem.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court of Appeals initially held RCBC liable for damages due to constructive fraud for failing to provide proper notice. The Supreme Court REVERSED this, finding RCBC not liable.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Notice Requirement:** The core issue revolves around whether Royal Cargo, as a judgment creditor with an attachment, was entitled to the 10-day prior notice of the foreclosure sale. Section 14 of the Chattel Mortgage Law does not explicitly include attaching creditors as those requiring notice, but Section 13 allows an attaching creditor to redeem.
*   **Res Judicata:** The lower courts incorrectly applied res judicata based on prior interlocutory orders regarding the motion to dismiss. The Supreme Court clarified that those prior decisions did not constitute a judgment on the merits.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 1508 (Chattel Mortgage Law):** Sections 13 and 14 are central to the dispute regarding notice and redemption rights.
*   **Civil Code Article 2244:** Relates to preferred credits in insolvency proceedings.
*   **Paray v. Rodriguez (G.R. No. 132287):** No right of redemption exists over personal property per Chattel Mortgage Law.
*   **Top Rate International Services, Inc. v. IAC (G.R. No. 67496):** Clarifies the concept of equity of redemption.
*   **Perkin Elmer Singapore v. Dakila Trading (G.R. No. 172242):** Allows attorneyâ€™s fees for a compulsory counterclaim, despite dismissal of the original complaint.
*   **Allied Banking Corp. v. Salas, G.R. No. L-49081:** Registration of a chattel mortgage serves as notice to creditors
*   **Northern Motors Inc. v. Judge Coquia, G.R. No. L-40018:** Rights of an attaching creditor are subordinate to a valid chattel mortgage

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *granted* RCBC's petition, reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, and dismissed Royal Cargo's claim for annulment. The court held that while Royal Cargo had a right to be informed of the sale to exercise its equity of redemption, RCBC was not liable for constructive fraud. The court noted Royal Cargo had failed to allege that it had not received notice of the February 3, 1992, RTC decision granting leave for extrajudicial foreclosure of the assets, in their complaint. Royal Cargo's negligence in failing to exercise its right of redemption after having been notified of the intent to foreclose and their initial opposition to the act, weighed against their claim. Further, the court ordered Royal Cargo to pay RCBC P250,000 as attorney's fees for defending against the unfounded suit.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of the chattel mortgage and RCBC's prior registered lien, and underscored the limited right of redemption in chattel mortgages, that being an equity of redemption that must be exercised prior to sale. The court found Royal Cargo's delay in acting prejudiced its claim and reinforced the secured creditor's rights.
