## Legal Document Summary: *Estate of Pedro C. Gonzales vs. Heirs of Marcos Perez* (G.R. No. 169681)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision reversing the RTC decision in an action for annulment/rescission of a deed of transfer and reconveyance with damages.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over a 375 sq.m. portion of land (Lot C-3, later Lot C-1 and part of C-2) originally owned by the Municipality of Marikina and sold to Pedro Gonzales.
*   **1966 Sale:** Pedro Gonzales (predecessor of Petitioners) sold the 375 sq.m. portion to Marcos Perez (predecessor of Respondents) via a *private* Deed of Sale.  This deed was *not* notarized.
*   **Municipal Sale & Approval:** Prior to the sale to Perez, the Municipality of Marikina sold Lots A & C to Gonzales. However, this sale was subject to the approval of the Provincial Governor of Rizal under Section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code. There's no record of the Governor's approval or disapproval.
*   **1992 Deed:** The Municipality executed a Deed of Absolute Transfer of Real Property in favor of the Estate of Pedro Gonzales, resulting in TCT No. 223361. The Estate then subdivided Lot C, leading to new titles (TCT 244447 and 244448) which are now in dispute.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Heirs of Perez seek reconveyance based on the 1966 private Deed of Sale.

**Court Decisions:**

*   **RTC:** Ruled for Petitioners, finding the 1966 Deed of Sale void due to lack of notarization and that Pedro couldn't have validly sold the land in 1966 before he officially owned it (before the 1992 Deed).
*   **CA:** Reversed the RTC. Held the 1966 sale valid and binding *inter partes*, despite not being a public document. Ordered Petitioners to reconvey the land.  Relied on evidence of the sale, finding substantial proof that Pedro sold the property to Marcos for consideration and that the requirements for the deed of sale were met.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Estate of Gonzales):** Ordered to reconvey the property (covered by TCT No. 244447 and 5 sq.m. from TCT 244448) to the Respondents (Heirs of Perez).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of 1966 Deed:** The lack of notarization raises questions regarding its status under the Statute of Frauds (Article 1403(2), Civil Code) and Article 1358 regarding creation of real rights in an immovable. The Court here held the requirements were met because the deed was in writing and subscribed by the necessary parties.
*   **Governor's Approval (Section 2196, Revised Administrative Code):**  The absence of proof of approval or disapproval of the Gonzales-Marikina sale by the Provincial Governor presents a potential ambiguity.  The Supreme Court relies on *Municipality of Camiling v. Lopez* (99 Phil. 187 (1956)) and *Pechueco Sons Company v. Provincial Board of Antique* (L-27038, January 30, 1970, 31 SCRA 320) in stating that such a contract is *voidable*, not void ab initio.
*   **Presumption of Consideration:** The CA noted no receipt was presented, but that the Deed of Sale meets the requirements and that consideration is presumed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1356, 1357, 1358, 1403(2), 1405, 1406, 1496, 1497.
*   **Revised Administrative Code:** Section 2196.
*   **Municipality of Camiling v. Lopez, 99 Phil. 187 (1956):**  Effect of Governor's approval.
*   **Pechueco Sons Company v. Provincial Board of Antique, L-27038, January 30, 1970, 31 SCRA 320:** Effect of Governor's approval.
*   **Gonzales v. Climax Mining Ltd., G.R. No. 161957, February 28, 2005, 452 SCRA 607:**  Nature of voidable contracts.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. The key takeaway is that even a private, unnotarized deed of sale of real property is valid *inter partes*. The Supreme Court focused on the delivery and possession of the property to Marcos Perez as proof of the validity of the contract of sale. The absence of the Governor's approval was deemed to render the contract voidable, but since it was never annulled it stands and confers ownership.
