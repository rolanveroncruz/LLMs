## Legal Document Summary: *Diaz-Duarte v. Sps. Ong, G.R. No. 130352*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning ownership of Lot 1208 of the Tacloban Cadastre.

**Core Issue:** Determination of superior right over Lot 1208 between Rogelia Diaz-Duarte (Petitioner) and Sps. Ben and Ethyl Ong (Respondents).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Ownership History:** The case traces ownership through multiple marriages and inheritances stemming from original owner Macario Diaz. Rogelia Diaz-Duarte (daughter of Macario from his second marriage) claims ownership through a repurchase agreement from Wilfredo Corregidor, who initially bought it from her.
*   **Invalid Affidavit of Adjudication:** The RTC declared Rogelia Diaz-Duarte's initial affidavit of adjudication and sale to Wilfredo Corregidor as null and void because she was not the sole heir of Macario Diaz.
*   **Adverse Claim:** Rogelia Diaz-Duarte filed an adverse claim on Corregidor's title when he refused to return the title after repurchase.
*   **Erroneous Cancellation of Adverse Claim:** The Register of Deeds *erroneously* cancelled Diaz-Duarte's adverse claim after 30 days without a verified petition for cancellation, as required by Section 70 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).
*   **Sale to Ongs:** Corregidor subsequently sold Lot 1208 to Sps. Ong, who claimed to be innocent purchasers for value and in good faith.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC, finding the Ongs to be buyers in good faith and for value.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals, reinstating the RTC decision in favor of Diaz-Duarte.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Register of Deeds:** Liable for wrongfully canceling Diaz-Duarte's adverse claim without due process (verified petition and hearing).
*   **Sps. Ong:** Not considered innocent purchasers for value due to the existing adverse claim on the title when they purchased the property, even though it was erroneously cancelled. Bound by their lawyer's negligence in not properly verifying the title status.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith Purchaser Issue:** The core risk revolved around whether the Ongs could successfully claim status as innocent purchasers for value. The Supreme Court's strict application of the adverse claim rule and imputation of the lawyer's negligence to the Ongs is a significant point.
*   **Validity of the Original Sale:** The RTC decision finding the initial Affidavit of Adjudication and Sale invalid could raise future challenges if the heirs of Trinidad Diaz-Arteche pursue claims to the portion awarded to Rogelia Diaz-Duarte.
*   **Mortgage Lien:** The property is subject to the mortgage lien of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC). The case does not fully resolve how that lien will be addressed given the ownership determination, leaving potential future litigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 70:** Central to the ruling, specifically concerning the requirements for cancelling an adverse claim.
*   ***Sajonas v. Court of Appeals***, 258 SCRA 79 (1996):  Cited to establish that a notice of adverse claim does not automatically expire after 30 days; a petition for cancellation is required.
*   ***Gonzales v. Bersamin***, 254 SCRA 652 (1996):  Cited in relation to the requirement of a hearing for adverse claim cancellation.
*   ***Sandoval v. Court of Appeals***, 263 SCRA 275 (1996) & ***Yu v. Court of Appeals***, 251 SCRA 509 (1995): Cited on the definition of a purchaser in good faith and for value.

**Contentious Clauses & Ambiguities:**

*   **Erroneous Cancellation:** The wrongful cancellation of the adverse claim is the most contentious issue and the crux of the Supreme Court's decision.
*   **Lawyer Negligence:** The imputation of the lawyer's negligence to the Ongs is another contentious issue.
*   **Impact on Mortgage Lien:** The judgment does not specify how the RCBC mortgage lien will be addressed, which introduces some ambiguity.
