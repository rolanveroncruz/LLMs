**Case Summary: *People v. Mendoza*, G.R. No. 225061 (2018)**

This Supreme Court decision reverses the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Jomar Mendoza y Magno for violations of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Republic Act No. 9165 (RA 9165), the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Court *acquitted* Mendoza based on *reasonable doubt* due to the prosecution's failure to comply with the chain of custody rule outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Prosecution must prove the sale of illegal drugs and lack of legal authority.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165:** Illegal possession of dangerous drugs. Prosecution must prove possession of illegal drugs and lack of legal authority.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):** Chain of Custody rule. Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photographing *at the place of seizure* (or nearest police station/office if warrantless).
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), an elected public official, and a representative from the National Prosecution Service (NPS) *or* the media *during* the inventory and photographing.
    *   Signatures of the required witnesses on the inventory, and copies provided to them.

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant (initially) convicted of violating Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165, facing imprisonment and fines.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-compliance with Section 21:** The primary basis for the acquittal. The prosecution demonstrably failed to secure the presence of an NPS or media representative during the inventory, and failed to provide a justifiable reason for this omission. The Court emphasized that a confidential character of the buy-bust is not a justifiable reason to exclude any of the required witnesses.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The court reiterated the limited exceptions permitting non-compliance with Section 21. The prosecution did not demonstrate the existence of any such exception. See *People v. Sipin* G.R. No. 224290, 11 June 2018 for list of justifiable reasons.
*   **Fruits of the Poisonous Tree:** The defense argued the evidence was inadmissible due to an illegal arrest. While the Court did not base its decision solely on this, the failure to follow proper procedures in the buy-bust operation tainted the seizure and subsequent chain of custody.
*   **Lack of Photography:** No photograph was taken of the seized items at the time of marking, further weakening the chain of custody.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165)**
*   **People v. Ocampo, G.R. No. 232300, 1 August 2018.** Highlights importance of the three witness rule.
*   **People v. Sipin, G.R. No. 224290, 11 June 2018.** Defines justifications for absent witnesses.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, 4 September 2018.** Outlines mandatory guidelines for proving chain of custody.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The police officer's explanation for not including media ("to keep our operation secret") was explicitly rejected by the Court as a valid justification for non-compliance with Section 21. The Court made sure that the buy-bust team could inform the member of the media prior to the operation or after the accused's arrest and that either instance will not result in leakage of the planned operation.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court strictly applied the chain of custody rule, as amended by RA 10640, and found the prosecution's failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 21 fatal to their case. The *People v. Sipin* and *People v. Lim* rulings are crucial precedents cited in the decision, emphasizing the need for strict compliance with Section 21 and consequences of failing to do so. The lack of justification for not having an NPS or media representative present was the central issue leading to the acquittal. This case reinforces the importance of meticulous adherence to the chain of custody procedures in drug-related prosecutions to safeguard the rights of the accused and prevent evidence tampering.
