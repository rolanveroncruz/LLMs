## Legal Document Summary - *Maruhom v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 179430*

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64 assailing COMELEC Resolutions denying due course to or cancelling the Certificate of Candidacy (COC) of Petitioner Maruhom for mayoralty candidacy.

**Key Issue:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in invalidating Maruhom's Marantao voter registration and consequently cancelling her COC based on false material representation due to double registration.

**Facts:** Maruhom filed a COC to run for Mayor of Marantao. Private Respondent Abinal (incumbent mayor) filed a petition to disqualify Maruhom under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) (B.P. 881), alleging double registration (Marawi and Marantao) and false material representations in both registrations and COC. COMELEC First Division and En Banc ruled in favor of Abinal, finding Maruhom's Marantao registration void ab initio based on COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 00-1513 (subsequent registration void).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED Maruhom's petition, affirming COMELEC Resolutions.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 78, OEC:** Allows for the denial or cancellation of a COC based on false material representations.
*   **Section 39(a), Local Government Code of 1991 (R.A. 7160):** Elective local official must be a registered voter in the relevant locality.
*   **COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 00-1513:** Subsequent voter registration is void ab initio while the first registration subsists.
*   **Obligation to Truthfully State Eligibility:** Candidates have a duty to truthfully state their eligibility in their COC, under oath (Sec. 73, OEC).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Cancellation of COC:**  Making false material representations can lead to the cancellation of a COC, preventing a candidate from running.
*   **Potential Election Offense:** The COMELEC En Banc ordered investigation on the possible commission of an election offense by Maruhom.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 881 (Omnibus Election Code):** Section 78, Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy. Sections 73, Certifcate of Candidacy

*   **Republic Act No. 8189 (Voter's Registration Act of 1996):** Section 33, conferring jurisdiction over voter inclusion/exclusion to MTCs/MeTCs.
*   **COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 00-1513:** Annuls subsequent voter registrations while the first subsists.
*   **Velasco v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 180051:** Materiality and intent to deceive in false representation under Sec. 78.
*   **Fermin v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 179695:** False representation regarding eligibility under Sec. 78.

*   **Bautista v. COMELEC, 460 Phil. 459:** Importance of truthfulness in elective office.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction over Voter Registration vs. COC Cancellation:** Maruhom argued that the COMELEC lacked jurisdiction to rule on voter registration validity, as that power lies with the MTCs under R.A. 8189. The Court distinguished this by emphasizing the COMELEC's power to rule on COC validity under Section 78 of the OEC.
*   **Materiality and Intent:** The Court found that Maruhom's false representation regarding her voter registration was material because it affected her eligibility. It also inferred intent to deceive based on Maruhom's pending request to cancel her Marawi registration, filed before the COC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The decision solidifies COMELEC's broad authority to interpret and apply election laws, potentially impacting future candidates with similar issues.
*   The Court's interpretation of "intent to deceive" could be subject to debate in future cases.
