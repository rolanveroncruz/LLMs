**Case Summary: *88 Mart Duty Free, Inc. v. Fernando U. Juan*** (G.R. No. 167357, November 25, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 re CA decision affirming RTC ruling in a Sum of Money and Damages case.

**Key Issue:** Existence of perfected contract of sale and propriety of the writ of preliminary attachment.

**Facts:**

*   Juan (Respondent) and Lui (CEO of 88 Mart Duty Free, Inc. - Petitioner) negotiated a sale of imported goods.
*   Lui agreed to purchase the goods for US$39,165.
*   Juan delivered invoices and shipping documents to Petitioner's employee.
*   Shipment transferred to Petitioner’s name.
*   Petitioner refused to pay; Juan sued for sum of money.
*   Petitioner claimed no perfected sale, arguing Lui only expressed interest in specific items and that he offered to help secure import permits for Juan.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Respondent, finding a perfected contract and holding Petitioner and Lui solidarily liable.
*   CA affirmed the RTC decision regarding the existence of a perfected sale and issuance of the writ, but removed Lui’s solidary liability.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court partially granted the petition. The existence of a perfected contract was upheld, but the writ of preliminary attachment was deemed improperly issued.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Perfected Contract of Sale:** SC affirmed lower courts’ finding of a perfected contract based on agreement on the price and delivery of documents. This establishes the Petitioner's obligation to pay the purchase price. *Art. 1458 of the Civil Code* defines a sale. *Art. 1475* states that the sale is perfected upon meeting of the minds.
*   **Purchase Price Obligation:** Petitioner liable for the outstanding balance of the purchase price, subject to deduction for the amount recovered from the public auction of the goods (P165,000). *Art. 1582 of the Civil Code*.
*   **Writ of Preliminary Attachment:** The SC reversed the CA and held the writ was improperly issued. The grounds for such writ as per *Rule 57, Section 1 of the Rules of Court* were not met as the lower courts found no evidence of fraud on the Petitioner's part in incurring the obligation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fraud Allegations:** The initial claim by Juan alleged fraud by 88 Mart. While the CA affirmed the writ, the SC reversed on the ground that no fraud was proven. *Rule 57, Section 1(d) of the Rules of Court* states that such writ can be issued if there is a fraud in contracting a debt.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision emphasizes the limitation of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to questions of law under *Rule 45 of the Rules of Court*, citing *B & I Realty Co., Inc. v. Spouses Caspe, G.R. No. 146972, 29 January 2008*
* *Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Dy, G.R. No. 156887, 3 October 2005, 472 SCRA 1; Chiudian v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 139941, 19 January 2001, 349 SCRA 745; and Uy v. CA, G.R. No. 95550, 23 November 1992, 215 SCRA 859.*

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code provisions on Sales (Arts. 1458, 1475, 1582).
*   Rules of Court, Rule 45 (Petition for Review), Rule 57, Section 1 (Grounds for attachment).

**Analysis and Recommendations:**

The SC's decision clarifies the requirements for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment, particularly the necessity of proving fraud when the writ is based on fraudulent conduct related to the debt. The ambiguity surrounding the initial agreement and its interpretation highlights the importance of clearly documenting all conditions and reservations in commercial transactions. The petitioner successfully avoided solidary liability and the writ, but is still liable for the outstanding debt.
