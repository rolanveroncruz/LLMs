## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 192285, July 11, 2018

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' denial of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Heirs of Mateo Encarnacion
*   **Respondent:** Thomas Johnson

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Foreign judgment from the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, finding Narvin and Mary Edwardson liable to Johnson for breach of contract (fraudulent investment scheme).
*   **Philippine Case:** Action for Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgment filed by Johnson in the RTC of Olongapo City (Civil Case No. 110-0-2003).
*   **Mareva Injunction:**  Canadian court issued a Mareva injunction against the Edwardsons, authorized its enforcement in foreign jurisdictions.  The RTC initially restrained the Edwardsons from disposing of assets, including those allegedly fraudulently transferred to Mateo Encarnacion.
*   **RTC Proceedings:** RTC declared the Edwardsons in default and rendered judgment in accordance with the Canadian judgment. A writ of execution was issued and later amended to include properties registered in the name of Mateo Encarnacion, who was not a party to the original Canadian or Philippine case. Properties were sold in public auction to Johnson.
*   **Third-Party Claim:** Mateo Encarnacion filed a Third-Party Claim asserting ownership over levied properties.
*   **Annulment of Judgment:** Mateo Encarnacion (later substituted by his heirs) filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment with the CA, arguing lack of jurisdiction and extrinsic fraud, specifically contesting the inclusion of his properties in the execution sale without notice.

**Key Issues:**

1.  Whether annulment of judgment is the proper remedy for a third-party claimant whose properties are levied under execution.
2.  Whether an alien (Johnson) can own private lands in the Philippines by virtue of an execution sale.

**Court's Holding:**

*   Petition for Annulment of Judgment is **DENIED**.
*   Public auction sales to Johnson are **NULLIFIED** due to violation of Section 7, Article XII of the Constitution (prohibition on foreign ownership of lands).
*   Case is **REMANDED** to the RTC for a new auction sale excluding Johnson.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **RTC:** Obligated to execute the original judgment against the Edwardsons.
*   **RTC:** Prohibited from allowing Johnson to participate in the public auction of lands.
*   **Johnson:** Entitled to receive the proceeds of any valid public auction sale related to the execution of the judgment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court acknowledges the RTC's jurisdiction over the action for recognition of foreign judgment.
*   **Third-Party Standing:** Court states that the third party has to prove that the judgment was obtained by fraud. Court says Mateo did not have standing to file the Petition for Annulment.
*   **Propriety of Remedy:** The Court held that annulment of judgment is not the correct remedy, as the issue is the wrongful execution of the judgment, not the judgment itself. The correct remedy for the third-party claimant would be to file a "terceria" with the levying officer (Rule 39, Sec. 16) or vindicate their claim in separate action.
*   **Alien Land Ownership:** Most crucial point: The Court *motu proprio* raised the issue of the unconstitutionality of alien land ownership, which invalidated Johnson's acquisition of land through the execution sale, citing *Matthews v. Taylor* (G.R. No. 164584, June 22, 2009, 590 SCRA 394).
*   **Fraudulent Transfer Claims:**  The respondent alleged fraudulent transfer of properties from the Edwardsons to Mateo, creating a potential issue of fraudulent conveyance that may impact future proceedings.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **For the Heirs of Encarnacion:** Pursue a separate action to vindicate their claim of ownership of the properties under Rule 39, Section 16, focusing on evidence of ownership predating the alleged fraudulent transfer.
*   **For Johnson:** Be prepared for a new public auction and ensure compliance with Philippine land ownership laws. Pursue separate legal avenues to recover from the Edwardsons.
*   **Investigate Potential Fraudulent Conveyance:** Determine the validity of the transfer of land from Edwardsons to Encarnacion as it may be litigated.
