**Case Summary: Castillo vs. BPI, G.R. No. 214053 (June 6, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of the appeal from the RTC's decision granting BPI's petition for *ex parte* issuance of a writ of possession following extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Teodorico and Alice Castillo (Petitioners) obtained loans from Prudential Bank (now BPI) secured by a real estate mortgage over TCT No. 102607.
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Petitioners defaulted, leading to extrajudicial foreclosure by BPI under Act No. 3135 (as amended by R.A. No. 4118). BPI was the highest bidder.
*   **Writ of Possession:** BPI obtained an *ex parte* writ of possession from the RTC.
*   **Appeal and Withdrawal:** Petitioners appealed to the CA (dismissed), then to the Supreme Court. Petitioners subsequently filed a Withdrawal of Petition based on a compromise.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to repay the loans, secured by the mortgage. Upon default, they were obligated to allow foreclosure and potential dispossession.
*   **BPI:** Obligated to follow the legal procedures for extrajudicial foreclosure under Act No. 3135 and R.A. No. 4118.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Liable for the outstanding loan amount, potentially losing the mortgaged property.
*   **BPI:** Liable for adhering to proper foreclosure procedures; failure to do so could render the foreclosure invalid.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Foreclosure:** If BPI failed to strictly comply with Act No. 3135, the foreclosure could be challenged by the Petitioners.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** The Withdrawal of Petition suggests a compromise. The terms of this compromise are crucial. If BPI failed to adhere to the terms of the compromise, petitioners could possibly re-litigate.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by R.A. No. 4118):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages. Compliance with this Act is critical.
*   **Writ of Possession:** Issuance pursuant to Section 7, Act No. 3135. Jurisprudence related to the ministerial duty of the court to issue a writ of possession to the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale, *provided the proper procedure has been observed*.
*   **Supreme Court Resolution:** Dismissing the petition because of the implied concurrence or approval based on the inaction of the respondent after the submission of the withdrawal by the petitioners.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Terms of Compromise (Implied):** The existence of a compromise agreement underlying the Withdrawal of Petition is the key unresolved point. The terms of the agreement, whether written or oral, are paramount. The court's dismissal is based on an assumption of BPI's acquiescence.
*   **BPI's Silence:** BPI's failure to comment on the Withdrawal of Petition is interpreted as implied concurrence.

**Analysis:**

The crucial aspect of this case revolves around the unstated compromise agreement that prompted the Petitioners' Withdrawal.  The Supreme Court dismissed the Petition because of the inaction of the respondent, it can be presumed that it is the decision of the SC to honor the terms of the compromise.
