## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lagao, G.R. No. 120279 (1998)

**Type:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines; Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction.

**Subject Matter:** Criminal Law; Murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code).

**Facts:**

*   Arturo Lagao was convicted by the RTC of murder for the death of Marcos dela Cruz, allegedly committed with co-accused Virgilio Lagao and Arturo Catheza (both at large).
*   The Information alleged conspiracy, treachery, and use of a bladed weapon and wooden clubs.
*   The prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from Alfredo and Enrique Calonge, uncles of the victim, who stated the victim was clubbed to death.
*   However, the post-mortem examination by Dr. Sales indicated the cause of death was a stab wound, with only a single contusion (bruise) found on the lower lip.
*   The accused presented an alibi, claiming he was working in Baguio City at the time.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony vs. Medical Evidence:** The core issue revolves around the inconsistency between the eyewitness accounts (clubbing) and the medical evidence (stabbing).
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Supreme Court scrutinizes the credibility of Alfredo and Enrique Calonge, finding significant flaws and inconsistencies in their testimonies.
*   **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** The appellant argues that the prosecution failed to establish his identity as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi is presented.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies**: The Trial court considered the fact that there was no testimony as to how the deceased was stabbed a "minor inconsistency."

**Analysis & Holdings:**

*   **Reversal of RTC Decision:** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC's decision, acquitting Arturo Lagao.
*   **Doubt on Identification:** The Court found that the prosecution evidence did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to inconsistencies and flaws.
*   **Material Inconsistency:** The Court considered the inconsistency between the alleged cause of death by the eyewitnesses and the doctor's report as not "minor."
*   **Alibi & Presumption of Innocence:** The court restated that the prosecution needs to prove the elements of the crime with certainty, and that the accused has the right to constitutional presumption of innocence.
*   **Conflicting Sworn Statements:** Alfredo declared that the appellant stabbed Marcos dela Cruz during the preliminary investigation. However, during the trial, these eyewitnesses swore that Marcos dela Cruz was clubbed to death by appellant and his co-accused.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Co-accused at Large:** The acquittal of Arturo Lagao may complicate the future prosecution of the co-accused if they are apprehended.
*   **Inconsistency in Witness Statements:** There exists inconsistencies as to what happened on the night that Marcos Dela Cruz was killed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines the crime of murder.
*   **Section 14(2), Article III, 1987 Constitution; Sec. 1(a), Rule 115, 1985 Rules On Criminal Procedure** Guarantees the presumption of innocence.
*   **People vs. Cruz, 231 SCRA 759 (1994)**: Addresses conflicting statements of witness.

**Legal Strategy Notes:**

*   This case underscores the importance of corroborating eyewitness testimony with forensic evidence, especially medical records.
*   Discrepancies between witness statements and objective facts (e.g., autopsy reports) can create reasonable doubt.
*   Alibi, while often considered a weak defense, can be effective when the prosecution's case is weak or inconsistent.
*   Defense Counsel should focus on the material inconsistencies with the report of Dr. Sales.
