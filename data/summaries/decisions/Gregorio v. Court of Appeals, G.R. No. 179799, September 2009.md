**Legal Document Summary: Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, Sansio Philippines, Inc., and Emma J. Datuin (G.R. No. 179799, September 11, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari assailing the CA decision that dismissed Gregorio's damage suit against Sansio and Datuin.  The core issue is whether Gregorio's complaint is based on quasi-delict or malicious prosecution.

**Key Provisions & Allegations (Gregorio's Complaint):**

*   **Basis of Action:** Articles 26, 2176, and 2180 of the Civil Code.  Gregorio alleges damages resulting from Sansio and Datuin's negligence in filing a B.P. Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law) complaint against her.
*   **Factual Allegations:**
    *   Datuin, acting for Sansio, filed a B.P. Blg. 22 complaint against Gregorio based on insufficiently funded checks.
    *   Incorrect address was provided in the complaint, preventing Gregorio from responding.
    *   Gregorio was arrested, detained, and fingerprinted.
    *   Datuin later executed an Affidavit of Desistance admitting Gregorio was not a signatory to the checks, attributing the initial complaint to an "honest mistake."
    *   Gregorio claims damages for humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, and expenses incurred to clear her name.
    *   Sansio is alleged to be vicariously liable for Datuin's actions under Art. 2180.
*   **Damages Sought:** Moral, actual, nominal, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA decision and reinstating the RTC's initial denial of Sansio and Datuin's motion to dismiss.
*   The SC held that Gregorio's complaint is based on **quasi-delict** (Art. 2176) in relation to Art. 26, not malicious prosecution. The material averments in the complaint and the character of the relief sought determine the nature of the action.
*   The court found that Gregorio's rights to personal dignity, personal security, privacy, and peace of mind were infringed by Sansio and Datuin's negligence and failure to exercise diligence in determining the correct identity of the signatory.
*   **Malicious Prosecution Distinguished:** The court highlighted that the absence of allegations of legal malice or bad faith, essential elements in a malicious prosecution claim, support the claim for Quasi-delict.
*   The court acknowledged that a claim for quasi-delict would not preclude recovery of moral damages and attorney's fees.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (B.P. Blg. 22):** Bouncing Checks Law
*   **Civil Code of the Philippines:**
    *   **Article 26:** Provides a cause of action for violation of personal dignity, security, privacy, etc., even if not a criminal offense.
    *   **Article 2176:** Defines quasi-delict as fault or negligence causing damage to another, absent a pre-existing contractual relation.
    *   **Article 2180:** Addresses the vicarious liability of employers for the acts of their employees acting within the scope of their assigned tasks.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Vicarious Liability:** Sansio faces potential liability for Datuin's actions if she was indeed negligent and acting within the scope of her employment. The key question will be, were the acts within the scope of her employment? This is a fact based inquiry.
*   **Damages Assessment:** While the Supreme Court has ruled that the complaint is viable, the extent of recoverable damages (moral, actual, nominal) remains to be determined by the trial court.
*   **Proof of Negligence:** Gregorio must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the fault or negligence of Sansio and Datuin, and the causal connection to the damages she allegedly sustained. The burden to prove will be on her as plaintiff.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court clarified that the action sounds in quasi-delict due to the allegations of negligence and the absence of allegations of malice. The case now reverts to the trial court for further proceedings, and the success of Gregorio's claim will hinge on proving negligence and damages.
