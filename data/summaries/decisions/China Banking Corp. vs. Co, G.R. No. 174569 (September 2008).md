**Case:** *China Banking Corporation, Spouses Joey & Mary Jeannie Castro and Spouses Richard & Editha Nogoy vs. Benjamin Co, Engr. Dale Olea and Three Kings Construction & Realty Corporation* (G.R. No. 174569, September 17, 2008)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over Lot No. 3783-E, claimed by Petitioners (China Banking Corporation and Spouses Castro and Nogoy) to be a road lot and Respondents constructed a perimeter wall blocking the Petitioners. Petitioners sought a preliminary mandatory injunction to compel Respondents to remove the wall and restore the lot to its previous condition. The lower courts (RTC and CA) denied the injunction. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the denial.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Property at Issue:** Lot No. 3783-E (TCT No. 269758-R) owned by Respondent Benjamin Co and siblings, part of the Northwoods Estates subdivision project.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Lot 3783-E is a road lot and the construction of a perimeter wall by Respondents obstructs Petitioners' ingress and egress and impedes ventilation/clearance. They relied on Section 44 of Act No. 496 and Section 50 of P.D. 1529 and a previous TCT (No. 185702-R) containing a restriction as the basis for their claim.
*   **Relief Sought:** Preliminary mandatory injunction to remove the perimeter wall and restore the lot.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC denied the injunction, finding Petitioners failed to clearly show their rights were violated or that irreparable damage would result. The CA affirmed, holding the RTC did not abuse its discretion.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the denial of the injunction.

**Obligations:**

*   The case does not create any direct obligations, but it does touch on statutory obligations related to subdivision plans and road lots under Act No. 496 (as amended by R.A. 440) and P.D. 1529.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for damages sought by Petitioners if the main case (Civil Case No. 12834) is ultimately decided in their favor. However, the denial of the preliminary injunction suggests a weakness in their claim.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Establish Clear Right:** The SC emphasized that a preliminary mandatory injunction is justified only in a clear case, free from doubt. The lack of a clear annotation on the current TCT indicating a road lot is a significant hurdle.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC afforded presumption of regularity to the Respondents' TCTs (Nos. 247778-R and 269758-R), implying that any previous restrictions were properly removed.
*   **Factual Findings:** The RTC's ocular inspection revealed that the lot was not being used as an access road and that Petitioners would not lose access to their residences. This is difficult to overturn on appeal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 496 (The Land Registration Act), Section 44:** Requires court approval for closing or disposing of streets/passageways delineated on a subdivision plan.
*   **P.D. 1529 (The Property Registration Decree), Section 50:** Similar provision regarding subdivision plans and restrictions on closing streets/passageways.
*   **Case Law re: Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions:**  The SC cites precedent that such injunctions should be issued cautiously and only in clear cases (e.g., *Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank, Inc.*, *Cortez-Estrada v. Heirs of Domingo Samut/Antonia Samut*, *Gateway Electronics Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines*).
*   **Case Law re: Regularity of Titles**: SC mentions presumption of regularity (*Ocampo v. Ocampo*, *Equatorial Realty Development, Inc. v. Mayfair Theater, Inc.*)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of a specific annotation on the current TCTs declaring Lot 3783-E as a road lot, versus the presence of such a restriction on a previous TCT (185702-R), creates ambiguity. The legal procedures followed for the removal of that restriction are questionable, although the court presumed legal processes were followed..
*   The factual finding that Lot 3783-E is not actually used as a road and that other access exists weakens Petitioners' claim, even if legally designated as a road lot.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Petitioners face a difficult battle. The denial of the preliminary injunction suggests a weakness in their case. The absence of a clear annotation on the current TCT and the factual findings of the lower court are significant obstacles. The presumption of regularity of the title favors the Respondents. The legal requirements of discharging the previous TCT are not well covered. A successful outcome for Petitioners would likely require overcoming these presumptions and proving that the lot is, in fact, a dedicated road and the construction of the wall has caused them irreparable harm. The case hinges more on factual determination than on legal principles, and the lower courtâ€™s factual findings were not overturned.
