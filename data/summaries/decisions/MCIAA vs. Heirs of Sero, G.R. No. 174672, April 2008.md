## Legal Document Summary: *Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority (MCIAA) vs. Heirs of Marcelina L. Sero, et al.* (G.R. No. 174672)

**Nature of Document:**  Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals decision that reversed the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for recovery of ownership and declaration of nullity of titles.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Expropriation:** The case centers around land originally expropriated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) in 1961 through Civil Case No. R-1881 for the expansion of Lahug Airport.
*   **Fee Simple Title:**  The 1961 judgment granted the Republic of the Philippines title in *fee simple* without any condition for reversion to the original owners if the purpose of expropriation ceased.
*   **Closure of Lahug Airport:** Lahug Airport was ordered closed in 1989, and its functions transferred to MCIAA created under R.A. No. 6958 in 1990.
*   **Reconveyance Claim:** The heirs of Ysabel Limbaga (Respondents) filed suit in 1999 claiming ownership, alleging that the original titles were fraudulently reconstituted by a party claiming to be Limbaga and sold. They argue that the land should be reconveyed since the airport is closed.
*  **Dismissal:** The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the MCIAA. SC reversed the Court of Appeals decision, reinstating the RTC's dismissal of the complaint.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **MCIAA:**  No obligation to reconvey the land, given the fee simple title.
*   **Respondents (Heirs):** No legal right to claim reconveyance under these circumstances.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. R-1881):** The decision in the original expropriation case is binding and dispositive, particularly the grant of fee simple title.
*   **Statute of Limitations:** The action for reconveyance based on fraud is time-barred, as the claim was filed 38 years after the expropriation decree, exceeding the 10-year prescriptive period.
*   **Laches:** Even if the statute of limitations did not apply, the respondents' 38-year delay in asserting their rights constitutes laches, barring their claim.
*   **Factual Discrepancies/Inadmissible Evidence**: As cited in *Heirs of Timoteo Moreno vs. Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority*, The landowners did not put forth admissible evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Mactan-Cebu International Airport v. Court of Appeals, 399 Phil. 695 (2000):***  This case is directly relevant as it previously addressed the issue of whether land expropriated for Lahug Airport must be reconveyed if the airport closed. The court held that it need not be, due to the fee simple title.
*   ***Heirs of Timoteo Moreno v. Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority, G.R. No. 156273, August 9, 2005***: Distinguished, though not overruled.  This case involved a different set of owners and turned on the presence of *preponderant proof of a right of repurchase*, which is absent here. This case illustrates that right to land titles for land owners that are similarly situated must be on a case to case basis.
*   ***Fery v. Municipality of Cabanatuan, 42 Phil. 28 (1921)***:  Cited for the principle that when land is acquired in fee simple for public use, the former owner retains no rights if the public use is abandoned.
*   ***Gicano v. Gegato, G.R. No. L-63574, January 20, 1988:***  Affirms the court's authority to dismiss a case on the ground of prescription based on the pleadings.
*   ***Declaro v. Court of Appeals, 399 Phil. 616, 623-624 (2000):*** The law must provide clear indication on the date of the issuance of the land title that is sought to be challenged.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6958:** Charter of the Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority.
*   **Rule 129, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Judicial Notice.
*   **Rule 9, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Dismissal of claims barred by the statute of limitations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The original reconstitution of the titles and the date of any alleged fraud is a contentious issue. The complaint is not specific on those dates.
*   Respondents' allegation of threat or intimidation by the petitioner lacks substance and was only raised in the Court of Appeals, diminishing its weight.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court has ruled decisively against the respondents' claim for reconveyance. The key factors are the fee simple title acquired by the government through expropriation, the considerable delay in asserting their claim resulting in prescription and laches, and the absence of any right to repurchase. The prior ruling in *Mactan-Cebu International Airport v. Court of Appeals* is controlling. This decision poses very little risks to the MCIAA and strengthens the entity's ownership.
