**Case Summary: *Larranaga v. Court of Appeals & People*** (G.R. No. 130644, March 13, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Resolution regarding a petition for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, habeas corpus concerning denial of preliminary investigation in kidnapping and serious illegal detention charges (Crim. Cases CBU-45303 & CBU-45304).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Right to Preliminary Investigation (PI):** The Court affirms Larranaga's right to a *regular* PI under Section 3, Rule 112, rejecting the prosecution's argument that only an inquest investigation was required under Section 7 due to alleged lawful warrantless arrest. The Court found no valid warrantless arrest under Section 5, Rule 113.  The court determined that a waiver of preliminary investigation must be "clear and unequivocal", disagreeing with the lower court that failure to attend a scheduled PI session constituted such waiver.
*   **Effect of Arraignment:** Despite the arraignment on October 14, 1997, the Court held the right to PI wasn't waived because Larranaga consistently invoked his right to a regular PI before arraignment and refused to enter a plea due to pending action before the Supreme Court.
*   **Validity of Detention:**  Critically, the Court *reversed* its earlier order for immediate release.  Citing *Sanchez v. Demetriou* (227 SCRA 627 (1993)), the Court ruled that the subsequent filing of informations and issuance of a warrant of arrest cured any defects from the initial, allegedly unlawful, detention.  Therefore, Larranaga's detention at the Bagong Buhay Rehabilitation Center was deemed lawful, regardless of the absence of a PI at the time of arrest.
*   **Venue Change for PI & Replacement of Prosecutor:** The Court denied the motion to transfer the PI venue from Cebu City to Manila and replace the City Prosecutor with the State Prosecutor, holding it lacked jurisdiction over prosecutorial functions, which lie within the Executive branch (Sangguniang Bayan of Batac, Ilocos Norte v. Albano, 260 SCRA 561 (1996)). Further, no actual prejudice on the part of the City Prosecutor was demonstrated despite media coverage of the proceedings (Webb v. De Leon, 247 SCRA 652 (1995)).
*   **Complaint against Lawyers:** Judge Ocampo's complaint against Larranaga's lawyers for allegedly withholding orders was dismissed due to lack of concrete evidence of intent to mislead the Court.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Office of the City Prosecutor of Cebu:** Obligated to conduct a regular preliminary investigation.
*   **Presiding Judge, RTC, Branch 7, Cebu City:** Ordered to cease and desist from proceeding with the trial pending the PI.
*   **Petitioner:** Retains obligation to participate in the regular PI. Continues to be detained.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Continuing Crime Doctrine:** The prosecution's failed argument regarding the "continuing crime" doctrine and its attempted application to warrantless arrest could resurface during trial, attempting to justify actions and circumvent the PI.
*   **Interpretation of "actual prejudice"**: The Court's ruling that "actual prejudice" must be demonstrated for change of venue sets a high bar. Future actions by the Prosecutor may need to be closely monitored for indications of actual bias to enable reconsideration of a motion for change of venue.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 112, Sections 3 & 7 (Preliminary Investigation Rules)**
*   **Rule 113, Section 5 (Lawful Warrantless Arrests)**
*   **Rule 102, Section 4 (Habeas Corpus)**
*   ***Sanchez v. Demetriou* (227 SCRA 627 (1993))**: Critical case cited to justify continued detention despite allegedly unlawful initial arrest, establishing that subsequent filing of charges and warrant of arrest cured initial defect.
*   ***Webb v. De Leon* (247 SCRA 652 (1995))** and ***People v. Teehankee* (249 SCRA 54 (1995))**: Case laws cited to justify denial of motion to change venue and replace prosecutor for lack of demonstration of actual prejudice resulting from media coverage of the proceedings.
*   ***Sangguniang Bayan of Batac, Ilocos Norte v. Albano* (260 SCRA 561 (1996))**: Case law cited to justify Court's lack of jurisdiction over prosecutorial functions.

**Recommendations:**

*   Closely monitor the conduct of the PI to ensure fairness and impartiality, documenting any instances suggesting bias on the part of the City Prosecutor.
*   Preserve arguments regarding the impropriety of the warrantless arrest for possible future habeas corpus petitions or appeals should trial outcomes be adverse.
*   Be prepared to renew the motion for change of venue and reassignment of prosecutor if evidence of actual prejudice emerges during or after the PI.
