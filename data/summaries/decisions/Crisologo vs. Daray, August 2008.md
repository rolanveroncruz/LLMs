**Legal Document Summary: *Crisologo v. Daray*, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2036, August 20, 2008 (584 Phil. 366)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Marivic Trabajo Daray for Gross Misconduct, Undue Delay, and Gross Ignorance of the Law relating to the denial of a Motion for Intervention.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Underlying Cases:** Civil Case Nos. 3220 & 3387, consolidated actions concerning the nullification of documents and a real estate mortgage. A compromise agreement was reached between original parties.
*   **Motion for Intervention:** Jesus G. Crisologo (Complainant) filed a motion to intervene, claiming co-ownership of the property subject of the litigation. He argued the compromise agreement prejudiced his rights.
*   **Denial of Intervention:** Judge Daray denied the Motion for Intervention, citing delay and suggesting a separate action. Rationale: Cases pending for a decade, intervention will delay adjudication of rights, complainant may have claims. *Magat, et al. vs. Delizo, et al., G.R. No. 135199, July 5, 2001* cited (though relevance is questionable as it doesn't directly support the denial).
*   **Procedural Irregularities:** Notice of Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration and the subsequent Decision approving the Compromise Agreement were sent to the *previous* counsel of record, not the current counsel of record, creating an issue of lack of due process.
*   **Notice of Appeal & Inhibition:** Complainant filed a Notice of Appeal of the denial of the Motion for Intervention and simultaneously filed a Motion for Inhibition. Judge Daray later inhibited herself, but the Notice of Appeal was not immediately acted upon by her before inhibition.
*   **CA Ruling:** The Court of Appeals found Grave abuse of discretion in the denial of complainant's motion for intervention warranting the issuance of writs of certiorari and mandamus in favor of complaint.

**Allegations/Charges:**

*   **Gross Misconduct:** Based on failure to notify current counsel of record of the court's actions.
*   **Undue Delay:** Failure to act on the Notice of Appeal.
*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law/Procedure:** Improper denial of the Motion for Intervention and improper procedure in the failure to notify current counsel of record.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court DISMISSED the administrative case against Judge Daray.

**Rationale:**

*   **Good Faith & Discretion:** SC emphasized that judges acting in their judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action absent bad faith or corruption.  *Maylas, Jr. v. Judge Sese, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2012, August 4, 2006, 497 SCRA 602, 605* & *Santos v. Judge How, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1946, January 26, 2007, 513 SCRA 25, 36* cited. Allowance/disallowance of intervention is discretionary. *San Miguel Corporation v. Sandiganbayan, 394 Phil. 608, 651-652 (2000)*.
*   **Intervention Justification:** Judge's explanation for denying the intervention was considered a valid exercise of discretion, prioritizing the resolution of long-pending cases and suggesting a separate action to protect complainant's rights.
*   **Notice of Appeal Issue:** SC found that after inhibition, Judge Daray could no longer act on the Notice of Appeal; that duty passed to the replacing judge. SC also highlighted that the appeal was perfected upon filing the notice of appeal, and not upon approval. *Victory Liner, Inc. v. Malinias, G.R. No. 151170, May 29, 2007, 523 SCRA 279, 295* cited.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Standard of Review:**  The SC heavily relied on the "good faith" defense, making it difficult to discipline judges for arguably erroneous rulings, especially regarding discretionary matters.
*   **Due Process Concerns (dissenting argument):** The failure to notify the current counsel of record arguably deprived the complainant of due process, as it prevented him from taking timely action to protect his rights. While attributed to court personnel error, a diligent judge has the ultimate responsibility to ensure proper notification.
*   **Intervention vs. Separate Action:** The suggestion that a separate action would better protect the complainant's rights ignores the potential for judicial economy and the risk of inconsistent rulings if the matters are closely intertwined.
*   **Impact of CA Decision:** The CA had already found Grave abuse of discretion. The SC minimized this finding, focusing on the Judge's good faith.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rules of Court, Rule 41, Section 12 (transmission of records to appellate court).
*   Implicit reference to the Rules of Court on Intervention.

**Case Law:**

**Summary for Attorney:**

The Supreme Court overturned the Investigating Justice's findings and dismissed the administrative complaint against Judge Daray. The court found that Judge Daray's denial of a motion to intervene and subsequent procedural errors were not driven by bad faith or corruption, and therefore did not warrant administrative sanctions. Although the Court of Appeals found Grave abuse of discretion, the Supreme Court placed more emphasis on the discretionary nature of intervention and on the good faith of the Judge. Focus on procedural due process issues is recommended. The ruling underscores the high threshold for disciplining judges for their judicial acts.
