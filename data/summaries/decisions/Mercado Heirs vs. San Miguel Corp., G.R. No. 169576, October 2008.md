## Legal Document Summary - *Mercado v. San Miguel Corporation*

**Case:** *Leonides Mercado v. Court of Appeals and San Miguel Corporation*, G.R. No. 169576, October 17, 2008 (590 Phil. 524)

**Subject Matter:** Validity of a Continuing Hold-Out Agreement, Deed of Assignment, and a counterclaim for unpaid beer products withdrawn on credit.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Heirs of Leonides Mercado (original plaintiff)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals and San Miguel Corporation (SMC, original defendant)

**Key Provisions and Agreements:**

*   **Continuing Hold-Out Agreement:** Mercado assigned CBC certificates of deposit (CDs) to SMC as security for a P7.5 million credit line. The agreement contained a clause giving SMC conclusive authority to encash the CDs upon Mercado's alleged default, regardless of factual default, with any dispute to be resolved solely between Mercado and SMC.
*   **Deed of Assignment:** Formalizes the assignment of the CBC CDs to SMC.
*   **Surety Bonds:** Mercado provided surety bonds from Eastern Assurance and Surety Corporation (EASCO) totaling P2.6 million.

**Obligations:**

*   **Mercado:** Obligated to pay SMC for beer products withdrawn on credit.
*   **SMC:** Obligated to release the assigned CDs upon full payment by Mercado.
*   **CBC:** Obligated to comply with SMC's demand to encash the CDs based on the hold-out agreement.
*   **EASCO:** Liable for the amount of the surety bonds should Mercado default.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Decision:** Mercado and EASCO jointly and severally liable to SMC for P7,468,153.75.
*   **CA Affirmed:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision.
*   **SC Decision:** The Supreme Court denied Mercado's petition, upholding the CA and RTC decisions.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Hold-Out Agreement (Art. 2088, Civil Code):** Mercado initially argued the agreement constituted a *pactum commissorium* (forfeiture without foreclosure), violating Article 2088. Although this was the initial basis of his complaint, he later abandoned this argument. However, the clause granting SMC conclusive authority to encash the CDs raises concerns about fairness and due process.
*   **Permissive vs. Compulsory Counterclaim:** Petitioners argued SMC's counterclaim for unpaid goods was permissive and required docket fees for the RTC to acquire jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held the counterclaim was compulsory, as it arose from the same transaction and occurrence as Mercado's claim to annul the security agreements. This hinged on the logical relationship test.
*    **Mercado's Acknowledgment of Debt:** Significant weight was placed on Mercado's acknowledgement of SMC's computation of his outstanding liability during trial.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2088, Civil Code:** Prohibits *pactum commissorium*.
*   **Rule 6, Sections 6 & 7, Rules of Court:** Defines counterclaims and distinguishes between compulsory and permissive counterclaims.
*   ***Financial Building Corporation v. Forbes Park Association, Inc.***, 392 Phil. 895 (2000): Establishes tests for determining whether a counterclaim is compulsory.
*   ***Alday v. FGU Insurance Corporation***, 402 Phil. 972 (2001): Example case cited for compulsory counterclaims.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Issues:**

*   **SMC's application of payments:** Mercado alleged payments were misapplied to old accounts not covered by the security. The court did not directly address this issue.
*   **Discrepancy in the amount of CD's:** Mercado claims P5M in CD's but SMC claims it only received P4.5M.
*   **Terms of the Surety Bond:** The period covered by the surety bond is only between Sept 24, 1990 and May 10, 1992. The default happened January 31, 1992, within the term of the bonds.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, emphasizing the compulsory nature of SMC's counterclaim. The key legal issue revolved around whether the continuing hold-out agreement was valid and whether the lower court had jurisdiction over the amount prayed for in SMC's counterclaim.
