**Case Summary: *Jeffrey T. Go v. Leyte II Electric Cooperative, Inc.*** (G.R. No. 176909, February 18, 2008)

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstating the RTC orders granting a writ of preliminary injunction against LEYECO II.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 7832 (Anti-Electricity Pilferage Act):** Central statute governing the case. Determines when disconnection is permissible.
*   **Section 4 (Prima Facie Evidence):** Outlines circumstances constituting prima facie evidence of illegal use of electricity, justifying disconnection after due notice. Requires attestation by an "officer of the law" (defined broadly, including barangay chairman). The presence of a broken seal and shunting wire on the meter established *prima facie* evidence of illegal use of electricity.
*   **Section 6 (Disconnection of Electric Service):** Permits immediate disconnection *only* when the consumer is caught *in flagrante delicto*.
*   **Section 9 (Restriction on Injunctions):** Restricts injunctions against electric utilities disconnecting service, *unless* (1) there's prima facie evidence of bad faith or grave abuse of authority *OR* (2) the consumer posts a bond equivalent to the differential billing.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 7832:** Provide additional definitions, including "officer of the law" (Rule III, Section 1) and clarification on injunctions (Rule VIII).

**Liabilities & Assessments:**

*   LEYECO II assessed Jeffrey Go P101,597.99 for pilferage differential billing and surcharges based on the findings of a tampered meter.
*   The court addresses whether LEYECO II has the right to disconnect the electrical service in the given circumstances.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Officer of the Law":** While the court upholds the IRR's broad definition, future cases may challenge the scope, particularly regarding barangay officials.
*   **Application of *In Flagrante Delicto*:** The court's strict interpretation (requiring direct eyewitness identification) limits the utility's ability to disconnect immediately based solely on circumstantial evidence.
*   **Injunction & Bonding Requirements:** The dual basis for injunctions (bad faith/abuse OR posting bond) creates potential for strategic litigation by consumers. The utility must diligently pursue remedies like counterbonds to dissolve improperly granted injunctions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7832:** "An Act Penalizing the Pilferage of Electricity..."
*   **People v. Fronda, 384 Phil. 732, 744 (2000):** Definition of *in flagrante delicto*.
*   **Manila Electric Company v. Navarro-Domingo, G.R. No. 161893, June 27, 2006, 493 SCRA 363:** Affirms the utility's right to file a counterbond to dissolve injunctions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Section 9 of R.A. 7832: The interpretation of "prima facie evidence of bad faith or grave abuse of authority" remains subjective and fact-dependent, leading to potential disputes. The standard for proving such bad faith or abuse is not clearly defined in the statute or implementing rules.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **For Utilities:** Focus on documenting inspections meticulously, ensuring compliance with Section 4 of R.A. 7832 (officer of the law presence).  Be prepared to post counterbonds to dissolve injunctions. Avoid claiming *in flagrante delicto* unless there is clear eyewitness testimony.
*   **For Consumers:** If facing disconnection based on alleged pilferage, immediately seek injunctive relief and be prepared to post a bond. Challenge the validity of the inspection or the amount of the differential billing.

**Overall:** The case clarifies the procedural requirements for disconnection under R.A. No. 7832 and emphasizes the consumer's right to seek injunctive relief by posting a bond, even absent proof of bad faith by the utility.
