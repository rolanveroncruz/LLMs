Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Sps. Alberto Gutierrez and Epifania Gutierrez vs. Sps. Rogelio and Josephine Valiente, et al.* G.R. No. 166802, July 4, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.

**Facts:**  A boundary dispute arose between Spouses Gutierrez (Lot 6098-D) and Spouses Valiente (Lot 6098-E), owners of adjacent properties in Bulacan. Spouses Valiente sued Spouses Gutierrez for Quieting of Title and Recovery of Possession with Damages (Civil Case No. 355-M-97) after a relocation survey showed Spouses Gutierrez occupying 99 sq. meters of Spouses Valiente's land. Spouses Gutierrez were declared in default. The RTC eventually ordered the verification and relocation survey of the lots.  The court approved the Surveyorâ€™s Report which found that Spouses Gutierrez encroached 17.95, 45 and 44 sq. meters of Lot 6098-E. The RTC ordered Spouses Gutierrez to reconvey the encroached areas.  Spouses Gutierrez filed a Motion to Quash Writ of Execution, arguing that the reconveyance order exceeded the reliefs prayed for in the original complaint. This was denied, leading to a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition in the CA, which was dismissed for procedural defects (defective verification, missing documents, and insufficient docket fees).

**Issue:**

*   Did the CA err in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition due to procedural defects?
*   Did the RTC commit grave abuse of discretion in ordering the reconveyance, as it exceeded the relief sought in the original complaint?

**Ruling:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** The Supreme Court held that the CA erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari based on the cited procedural grounds:

    *   **Defective Verification:** The verification requirement is formal and can be cured. The amended verification submitted with the Motion for Reconsideration should have been considered. *[Reference: Gordoland Development Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines, Benguet Corporation v. Cordillera Caraballo Mission, Inc., Ballao v. Court of Appeals]*
    *   **Missing Documents:** The CA required unnecessary documents to be attached. The only crucial documents were the orders being challenged. The other documents were irrelevant to the issue of grave abuse of discretion. *[Reference: Air Philippines Corporation v. Zamora]*
    *   **Insufficient Docket Fees:** The failure to pay the full docket fees was not intentional and cured upon motion for reconsideration, invoking the principle of substantial justice. *[Reference: Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion, Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals]*
*   **Substantive Issues:** Despite finding procedural errors, the Supreme Court ruled *against* Spouses Gutierrez on the merits:

    *   **Interlocutory vs. Final Order:** The Order directing a relocation survey was interlocutory. The Order requiring the reconveyance (June 23, 2003) was the final, appealable order.
    *   **Relief Exceeding Prayer:** The reconveyance order did not exceed the relief prayed for. The general prayer for "other reliefs just and equitable" allowed the RTC to order reconveyance, especially since the allegations in the complaint and the evidence presented supported it. *[Reference: BPI Family Bank v. Buenaventura]*
    *   **Motion to Quash:** The arguments raised by Spouses Gutierrez were related to the validity of the orders dated May 15, 2000 and June 23, 2003, and are not proper grounds for a Motion to Quash Writ of Execution.

**Holding:** The Petition for Review on Certiorari was **DENIED**. The CA's dismissal was AFFIRMED on the merits (despite the procedural errors). The RTC Orders were upheld. The Supreme Court emphasized the principle of finality of judgments.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation:** Spouses Gutierrez have the obligation to reconvey the encroached portions of Lot 6098-E to Spouses Valiente.
*   **Liability:** Spouses Gutierrez failed to file a motion for reconsideration or appeal, thereby losing their opportunity to challenge the RTC's ruling.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The main risk is that Spouses Gutierrez are now compelled to reconvey the property.
*   Spouses Gutierrez could face further legal action if they fail to comply with the reconveyance order.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Rule 7, Section 4, Rules of Court (Verification)
*   Rule 65, Section 1, Rules of Court (Certiorari)
*   *Gordoland Development Corp. v. Republic of the Philippines*
*   *Benguet Corporation v. Cordillera Caraballo Mission, Inc.*

*   *Air Philippines Corporation v. Zamora*
*   *Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion*
*   *Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals*
*   *BPI Family Bank v. Buenaventura*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the general prayer for "other reliefs just and equitable" is key. The Court interpreted it broadly, but the Gutierrezes might argue it was not specific enough to encompass reconveyance.
