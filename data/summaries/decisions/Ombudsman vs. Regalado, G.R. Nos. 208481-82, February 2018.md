## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. Maria Rowena Regalado* (G.R. Nos. 208481-82, Feb. 7, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals Amended Decision reducing the penalty imposed on respondent Regalado from dismissal to a one-year suspension for Grave Misconduct and violation of Section 7(d) of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Grave Misconduct:** Regalado, an Immigration Officer, was found guilty of Grave Misconduct for extorting money from St. Martha's Day Care Center under the guise of accreditation fees. She presented a falsified copy of Bureau of Immigration Office Memorandum Order No. RBR 00-57 (2000), inflating the accreditation fee from P10,000 to P50,000, and solicited "honoraria" for her boss.
*   **Violation of Section 7(d) of RA 6713:** Regalado solicited gifts and "honoraria" in connection with a transaction affected by her office. This section prohibits public officials from soliciting or accepting gifts in the course of their official duties or in connection with any operation being regulated by or any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their office.
*   **Findings of Fact:** The Court established that Regalado engaged in a *modus operandi* involving fake accreditation fees, solicitation of "honoraria," threats of delayed processing if payments weren't made, and even demanding surrender of the official receipt after payment to the cashier.
*   **Court of Appeals Amended Decision:** Initially, the CA upheld the Ombudsman's decision of dismissal. However, the CA Amended Decision reduced the penalty to a one-year suspension, citing mitigating circumstances like it being Regalado's first offense and purported testimonials of good performance from other clients.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Regalado has an obligation to adhere to the ethical standards of public office, including refraining from corrupt practices, as mandated by RA 6713 and the Constitution.
*   Her liability arises from the violation of Section 7(d) of RA 6713 and Grave Misconduct under the Civil Service Rules.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The central point of contention is the CA's consideration of "first offense" and "good work performance" as mitigating circumstances. The Supreme Court argues these are inapplicable to Grave Misconduct, where dismissal is mandated for even a first offense (citing *Duque v. Veloso* and *Medina v. Commission on Audit*).
*   **Solicited Testimonials:**  The SC criticizes the CA's reliance on testimonials from "satisfied clients," viewing them as irrelevant to the severity of the misconduct.
*   **Impact of 2017 RACCS:** Although promulgated after the events in question, the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS) are cited to underscore the severity of Grave Misconduct and explicitly disallow mitigating circumstances for offenses punishable by dismissal from service (Rule 10, Section 53).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article XI, Section 1:** Public office is a public trust.
*   **RA 6713, Section 7(d):** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees - Prohibits solicitation/acceptance of gifts.
*   **RA 3019, Section 3(c):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act - Corrupt practices of public officers (requesting/receiving gifts).
*   **CSC Resolution No. 991936, Rule IV, Section 52(A)(3):** Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service - Grave Misconduct penalty (Dismissal, even for 1st offense).
*   **CSC Resolution No. 1701077 (2017 RACCS), Rule 10, Sections 50 and 57:** Administrative Cases in the Civil Service - Classifies offenses, details penalties, and disallows mitigating circumstances for dismissal offenses.

**Case Law:**

*   **Pineda v. Claudio:** Public office as a public trust.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman v. Faller:** Definition of Grave Misconduct.
*   **Duque v. Veloso:** First offense is not a mitigating circumstance for Grave Misconduct.
*   **Medina v. Commission on Audit:** Length of service is not a mitigating circumstance for Grave Misconduct.

**Ambiguity:** The only real ambiguity resides in the CA's initial decision to reduce the penalty in light of the "satisfied client" affidavits, which the SC finds entirely misplaced.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition, reversed the CA's Amended Decision, and reinstated the original dismissal. The Court emphasized that Regalado's actions constituted Grave Misconduct, and neither the claim of a "first offense" nor "satisfied client" testimonials could mitigate the severity of the offense and the mandatory penalty of dismissal. Her actions were a blatant betrayal of public trust and a violation of the ethical standards demanded of public servants. The ruling underscores the zero-tolerance policy for corruption in the civil service.
