## Legal Document Summary - *Yap v. Cabales*, 606 Phil. 415 (2009)

**Case:** *Jesse Y. Yap v. Hon. Monico G. Cabales, et al.*, G.R. No. 159186, June 5, 2009.  Petition for review on *certiorari* of a CA decision affirming the denial of a motion to suspend criminal proceedings for violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang (B.P. Blg.) 22 (the Bouncing Checks Law) based on the existence of a prejudicial question in pending civil cases.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **B.P. Blg. 22:** Addresses the issuance of bouncing checks.  The core issue is whether the petitioner issued checks that were dishonored due to a closed account.

*   **Prejudicial Question:**  Petitioner argued that pending civil cases for collection of sum of money (Civil Case Nos. 6231 & 6238), involving the same checks, present a prejudicial question.  Petitioner contends lack of consideration negates liability under B.P. Blg. 22 because the law requires checks issued "for account or value".

**Obligations:**

*   The Petitioner, as the issuer of the checks, has the obligation to ensure sufficient funds in the account to cover the checks upon presentment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Violation of B.P. Blg. 22 for issuing dishonored checks.  The essence of the crime is the act of issuing a worthless check, regardless of intent or underlying obligation (citing *Lozano v. Martinez*, G.R. No. L-63419).

*   **Civil Liability:**  Potential liability for the face value of the dishonored checks in the civil suits, plus damages and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Conviction:** The core risk is a conviction for violating B.P. Blg. 22, leading to potential fines and/or imprisonment. The court emphasizes that B.P. Blg. 22 is *malum prohibitum*, making intent less relevant than the act of issuing the bad check.

*   **Financial Judgments:** Unfavorable judgments in the civil cases, requiring payment of the check amounts, damages, and legal costs.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang (B.P. Blg.) 22:**  The Bouncing Checks Law.
*   ***Lozano v. Martinez*, G.R. No. L-63419:** Landmark case defining the nature of B.P. Blg. 22 offenses, emphasizing that it punishes the act of issuing worthless checks, not the non-payment of debt.
*   ***Jose v. Suarez*, G.R. No. 176795:**  Illustrates that the underlying validity of a debt doesn't negate B.P. Blg. 22 liability.
*   ***Ricaforte v. Jurado*, G.R. No. 154438:**  Reinforces the principle that the *gravamen* of B.P. Blg. 22 is issuing a bad check.
*   ***Ras v. Rasul*, G.R. Nos. L-50441-42:** Distinguishes this case, explaining that the *Ras* case involved a genuine prejudicial question based on double sale and estafa and is factually different from this case.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on *Certiorari*.
*   **Definition of Prejudicial Question:** Cites *Carlos v. Court of Appeals, 335 Phil. 490, 499 (1997)* and *Tuanda v. Sandiganbayan, 249 SCRA 342 (1995)* to establish requirements

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The petitioner's claim of "lack of consideration" for the issuance of the checks. The court dismisses this as irrelevant to the B.P. Blg. 22 cases, but it may be relevant to liability under the civil suits.  The petitioner stopped payment due to alleged non-delivery of titles by Evelyn Te (the original payee).

**Analysis and Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, finding no prejudicial question.  The court reasoned that the determination of the petitioner's civil liability (whether the private respondents are entitled to collect on the rediscounted checks) is separate and distinct from the determination of criminal liability under B.P. Blg. 22. The critical factor is that the issuance of a dishonored check constitutes a *malum prohibitum* offense, irrespective of the underlying transaction.  The defense of lack of consideration is more properly raised in the criminal cases, but the success of that defense would not necessarily absolve the petitioner of criminal liability for issuing the bad checks.
