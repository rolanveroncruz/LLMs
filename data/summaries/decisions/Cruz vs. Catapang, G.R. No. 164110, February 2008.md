**Legal Document Summary: Cruz v. Catapang, G.R. No. 164110 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's affirmation of the MCTC's decision in a forcible entry case.

**Key Issue:** Whether consent from one co-owner to construct a house on co-owned property bars a forcible entry action by another co-owner.

**Decision:** Supreme Court granted the petition, reversed the CA decision, and reinstated the RTC decision. The Court held that the consent of only one co-owner is insufficient to validate the construction, and that such construction constitutes forcible entry.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Co-ownership Rights (Art. 486, Civil Code):**  Each co-owner can use the common property without injuring the interests of the co-ownership or preventing other co-owners' enjoyment.  Granting a third party exclusive use (building a house) violates this.
*   **Alterations (Art. 491, Civil Code):**  No co-owner can make alterations without the consent of *all* co-owners.  Construction of a house constitutes an "alteration" and an act of dominion.  Consent of one co-owner is insufficient.
*   **Forcible Entry:**  The Court held that despite one co-owner's consent, the respondent's entry was still "through strategy or stealth" vis-a-vis the non-consenting co-owner. The clandestine nature of obtaining consent from only one co-owner, coupled with the fact that the consenting co-owner resided in the constructed house, supports a finding of strategy.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent (Catapang):** Liable for vacating the illegally occupied portion of the property and is liable for attorney's fees and costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Disputes Among Co-owners:** The case highlights the potential for disputes among co-owners when decisions affecting the entire property are made without unanimous consent.
*   **Lack of clear partition agreement:** Absence of partition agreement among co-owners leads to complications such as this where one co-owner made unilateral decisions impacting the common property.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 486:** Use of common property.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 491:** Alterations to common property.
*   **De Guia v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 120864, October 8, 2003:**  A co-owner cannot devote common property to exclusive use.
*   **Go, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 142276, August 14, 2001:** Entry into the land effected clandestinely without the knowledge of the other co-owners could be categorized as possession by stealth.
*   **Bongato v. Malvar, G.R. No. 141614, August 14, 2002 & Elaine v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 80638, April 26, 1989:** Filing of a complaint for forcible entry within one-year period.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Strategy or Stealth" Definition:** The Court's interpretation of "strategy or stealth" is broadened to encompass obtaining consent from only one co-owner, even if done openly with that co-owner. This is a point that may be contentious, as the term typically implies secrecy *towards all* owners.
*   **Definition of 'Alteration':**  The court's determination that the house construction is an alteration implies that any form of building construction on commonly owned land qualifies as an alteration necessitating consent from all co-owners.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*  **Partition of the Property:** Co-owners may pursue judicial partition of the property to avoid future conflicts arising from the shared ownership and facilitate individual decision-making powers on divided portions.
