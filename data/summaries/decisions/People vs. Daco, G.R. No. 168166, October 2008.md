**Case Summary: People v. Daco, G.R. No. 168166, October 10, 2008**

**Nature:** Automatic review of CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Salvador C. Daco for seven counts of qualified rape of his daughter, AAA.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Seven counts of qualified rape under Art. 266-A, in relation to Art. 266-B, of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659 and RA 8353). The qualifying circumstance being the victim was under 18 years old at the time of the commission of the crime and the offender is the parent.
*   **Accusation:** The accused had carnal knowledge of his own daughter AAA, under the age of 18, on multiple occasions through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented victim's testimony, medical evidence of hymenal lacerations consistent with rape (Dr. Belmonte's testimony and medical certificate), and social welfare officer reports. Defense presented denial and alleged fabrication due to a prior disciplinary action (hitting AAA with a cassava) .

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Initially sentenced to death on each count by the RTC, modified by CA to include P75,000 moral damages and P25,000 exemplary damages in each case. Ultimately, the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole due to RA 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law). Also, the decision upheld the amount of damages.
*   **Financial Liabilities:** Obligation to pay the victim AAA P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages for each of the seven rape counts, totaling a substantial amount.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Victim:** The defense attempted to impeach the victim's credibility based on inconsistencies between her sworn statement and trial testimony. The court considered the age of the witness and the traumatic events. Case law (e.g., *People v. Drew*, *People v. Patalin*) holds that minor inconsistencies in ex parte affidavits are not necessarily grounds for discrediting a witness, especially in traumatic experiences like rape (*People v. Calayca*).
*   **Lack of Corroborating Witnesses:** The defense argued the prosecution's failure to present a friend who allegedly witnessed a portion of the first encounter, and the failure to disclose the charges to her mother and her siblings. The Court, however, maintained that the prosecution had discretion over presentation of evidence (*Guiyab v. People*), and the daughter revealed the charges to the older daughter.
*   **Defense of Fabrication:** The defense argued that the charges were fabricated due to a prior disciplinary action. The court dismissed this argument, citing precedent that disciplinary punishment is insufficient motivation for fabricating rape allegations (*People v. Ardon*, *People v. Cariñaga*, *People vs. Viajedor*).
