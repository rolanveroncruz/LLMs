## Legal Document Summary: *Argoncillo v. Court of Appeals*

**Case:** *Santiago Argoncillo, et al. v. Court of Appeals and the People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 118806, July 10, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of petitioners for illegal fishing with the use of explosives under Section 33 in relation to Section 38 of Presidential Decree No. 704 (as amended by P.D. No. 1058).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Illegal fishing with the use of explosives in violation of P.D. 704, Sec. 33.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented evidence of an explosion heard by a surveillance team, the presence of the accused near the site, and fish samples taken from the accused's banca exhibiting signs of being caught with explosives (ruptured air bladders, broken vertebral columns, blood clots).
*   **Defense:** The accused denied using explosives, claiming they were fishing with a net. Other accused claimed they were gathering shells or looking for "pulutan".
*   **Presumption:** The Court cites *Hizon v. Court of Appeals* (265 SCRA 517 (1996)) regarding the presumption under Section 33 of P.D. 704. Discovery of fish killed by explosives in a fishing boat creates a presumption that the owner/operator/fisherman was fishing with explosives.
*   **Defense Arguments & Court's Rationale:**
    *   *Lack of explosives or paraphernalia:* Rejected; the Court notes they could have been dumped into the sea.
    *   *Not all fish examined:* Rejected; a random sample is sufficient.
    *   *Delay in arrest:* Rejected; explained by lack of transportation.
    *   *"Deep sea fishes" in shallow water:* Rejected; the term "deep sea fishes" arose from the trial court's erroneous translation of "isda sa bato" or "bottom feeders" which were the terms actually employed by said witness to describe the subject fishes
    *   *Use of non-motorized banca:* Rejected; not a requirement for the crime.
    *   *Non-flight:* Rejected; does not automatically indicate innocence.
*   **Finding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. The presumption of illegal fishing was established and not rebutted by the accused. The trial court's assessment of witness credibility was upheld.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for illegal fishing with explosives.
*   Original straight penalty of twenty (20) years imprisonment under PD 704. Supreme Court modified to indeterminate penalty.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of Evidence:** The conviction hinged heavily on the expert testimony regarding the fish samples. Potential challenges could arise if the methodology or qualifications of the experts are called into question.
*   **Penalty**: The imposition of a *straight* 20-year sentence by the trial court was erroneous because it was not in accordance with Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 704, Section 33 (as amended by P.D. No. 1058)
*   Presidential Decree No. 704, Section 38 (a)(1).
*   Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law).

*   *Spouses Jose and Trinidad Bacar vs. Judge Salvador P. de Guzman, Jr.* (271 SCRA 328 (1997)) regarding the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
