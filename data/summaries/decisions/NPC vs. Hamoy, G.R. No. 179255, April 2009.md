## Legal Document Summary: *National Transmission Corporation v. Hamoy, Jr.* (G.R. No. 179255)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review concerning the Court of Appeals' decision ordering the return of Respondent Hamoy, Jr. to his original position as Vice-President for VisMin Operations & Maintenance. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Nature of Position:** The SC affirmed that Hamoy Jr.'s position as Vice-President was a **second-level position, NOT a third-level position under the Career Executive Service (CES)**. The determining factor is *who* made the appointment, not the nature of the duties. Because Hamoy was appointed by the TransCo President and CEO, not the President of the Philippines, his position does not fall under the CES.
*   **Presidential Appointment Required for CES:**  The Court reaffirms its prior rulings (e.g., *Office of the Ombudsman v. CSC*, G.R. No. 162215) that **only positions filled by presidential appointment fall under the CES**, referencing Book V, Title I-A, Chapter 2, Section 7(3) of the Administrative Code.  The SC distinguishes *Caringal v. PCSO* and *Erasmo v. HIGC*, clarifying that they address security of tenure for those *without* CES eligibility, not the definition of CES positions.
*   **Station-Specific Appointment:** The Court holds that Hamoy's appointment was **station-specific** despite the absence of a specific location on Civil Service Form No. 33.  The reference on the form to TransCo Board Resolution No. TC 2003-007, which designated him as "Item No. 700010-VisMin Operations & Maintenance," effectively incorporates the Board Resolution's designation into the appointment.
*   **Invalid Reassignments:** The Court affirmed the CA holding that the reassignments (initially a detail to Special Projects, then as OIC of the Power Systems Reliability Group) violated CSC rules and effectively constituted constructive dismissal. The initial reassignment exceeded the permissible one-year limit for station-specific positions. Further, the reassignments occurred despite Hamoy's objections.
*   **Reassignment Definition:** The SC clearly defines the term â€œreassignment" by referencing Executive Order No. 292 (1987), Book V. Title I, Subtitle A, Chapter V, Section 26(6) and (7).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **TransCo Obligation:** TransCo is obligated to reinstate Hamoy to his original position as Vice-President for VisMin Operations & Maintenance.
*   **TransCo Liability:** TransCo is liable for costs associated with the appeal process.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Abuse of Discretion in Reassignment:** The decision implicitly raises the risk of abuse of discretion in personnel reassignments, especially when they involve significant disruption to an employee and are undertaken without their consent. TransCo may be accused of using reassignments as a means of harassment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Administrative Code (Executive Order No. 292 (1987), Book V, Title I (Subtitle A), Chapter 2)
*   Presidential Decree No. 1 (Re: Third-Level appointees reassignment).
