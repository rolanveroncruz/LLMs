## Legal Document Summary: *ORMOC SUGARCANE PLANTERS' ASSOCIATION, INC. vs. COURT OF APPEALS* (G.R. No. 156660, August 24, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order directing Hideco Sugar Milling Co., Inc. (Hideco) and Ormoc Sugar Milling Co., Inc. (OSCO) to proceed with arbitration.

**Key Issue:** Whether sugarcane planters' associations have the legal standing to demand arbitration against sugar centrals based on milling contracts entered into between the centrals and individual planter-members.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition, upholding the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Milling Contracts:** These contracts govern the relationship between individual sugar planters and the sugar centrals.
    *   **Article VII:** Specifies the share of sugar and molasses between the centrals (34%), Planter (65%), and the Planter's association (1%).
    *   **Article XIV(B):** Restricts the centrals from providing better benefits to planters without the written consent of existing recognized associations, except for planters located beyond 30km from the mill.
    *   **Article XX:** Stipulates that disputes arising from the agreement shall be submitted to a five-member Board of Arbitration (2 appointed by the centrals, 2 by the Planter, 1 by the 4 previously mentioned).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Privity:** The SC emphasized that the associations were not parties to the milling contracts. The contracts were between the individual planters and the centrals. Therefore, the associations lack the legal standing to demand arbitration or sue in their own name. The SC relied on established contract law principles requiring privity.
*   **No Agency or Representation:** The milling contracts did not grant the associations the authority to represent individual planters in legal actions. Even if an agency relationship existed, suits must be brought in the name of the principal (Rule 3, Sec. 2, Rules of Court).
*   **Stipulation Pour Autrui Inapplicability:** The SC rejected the argument that the milling contract contained a stipulation pour autrui (stipulation in favor of a third person) benefiting the associations. The 1% share provision was deemed primarily for the benefit of the Planters, and any benefit to the association was merely incidental. Requisites for a stipulation pour autrui were not met: *South Pachem Development, Inc v. CA*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 876 (Arbitration Law):** The SC cited Section 2 and Section 4 of the Arbitration Law, emphasizing the requirement of a valid, written, and subscribed agreement to arbitrate between the parties.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** SC held that Certiorari was improper because appeal under Rule 45 was available. This challenges the wisdom, not the jurisdiction of the lower court.
*   **Rule 3, Section 2, Rules of Court:** The SC invoked this rule, highlighting that actions must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest (those who stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment). Oco v. Limbaring
*   **Article 1311, Civil Code:** Discusses Stipulations Pour Autrui, to which this Milling contract does not qualify.
*   **Uy v. Court of Appeals:** Cited to illustrate that agents, even if they provided services, are not considered parties to contracts executed by their principals and lack standing to sue.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While not inherently ambiguous, the 1% share provision (Article VII) was contentious. The associations argued it created a benefit enforceable by them, but the SC viewed it as primarily benefiting the Planters.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Individual planters risk facing procedural hurdles if acting individually. Association involvement may become beneficial for administrative convenience.
*   Centrals risk facing numerous individual claims if associations can not represent Planters. This could potentially expose the centrals to multiple lawsuits concerning the same core issues.
