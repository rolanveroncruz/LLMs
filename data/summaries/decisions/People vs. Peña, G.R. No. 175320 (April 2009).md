## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Peña y Sarmiento*, G.R. No. 175320 (2009)

This Supreme Court resolution affirms the conviction of Ernesto Peña y Sarmiento for violations of Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act (RA) No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, stemming from a buy-bust operation.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Violation of Section 5 (Illegal Sale):** Appellant was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of selling 0.04 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu") in violation of Section 5.
*   **Violation of Section 11 (Illegal Possession):** Appellant was also found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of possessing 0.03 grams of "shabu" in violation of Section 11.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The conviction is based on the testimony of MADAC operatives who conducted a buy-bust operation following a tip. The prosecution's evidence was deemed credible, establishing the sale and possession elements.
*   **Defense of Frame-Up Rejected:** The appellant's claim of being framed was rejected by the trial court, and this finding was upheld on appeal.

**Penalties Imposed & Modified:**

*   **Section 5 Violation (Illegal Sale):** Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000. This was affirmed.
*   **Section 11 Violation (Illegal Possession):** The CA affirmed the RTC which sentenced appellant to straight penalty of 12 years and 1 day and a fine of P300,000. The Supreme Court modified this to apply the Indeterminate Sentence Law, sentencing the appellant to imprisonment for a minimum of 12 years and 1 day to a maximum of 20 years and a fine of P300,000.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Specifically, Sections 5 (Sale) and 11 (Possession) are central to the charges and conviction.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Its application in Section 11 violation case.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The document does not explicitly detail the chain of custody of the seized drugs. While the crime lab confirmed the substance as methamphetamine hydrochloride, potential arguments could be raised if the chain of custody was weak or not meticulously documented in the underlying records. This could have been an issue on appeal, but seemingly wasn't a critical factor.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The appellant could have argued instigation if there was evidence of undue inducement by law enforcement. However, based on the resolution, it appears the defense primarily focused on a frame-up, rather than arguing the agents induced him to commit a crime he wouldn't have otherwise committed.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   There don't appear to be patently ambiguous clauses in the resolution itself. The contentious issues revolve around the factual determination of guilt and the proper application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
