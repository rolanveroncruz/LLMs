## Legal Document Summary: *Grandteq Industrial Steel Products, Inc. v. Edna Margallo* (G.R. No. 181393)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC's ruling which reversed the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of Edna Margallo's (Employee) complaint against Grandteq (Employer) and its President, Abelardo Gonzales. The case concerns claims for unpaid sales commission and reimbursement of car loan payments.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Car Loan Agreement:**  The central issue is the validity of a clause in the car loan agreement stating that in case of resignation, "all payments made by the personnel shall be forfeited in favor of the company."  The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's ruling that this clause is *contra bonos mores* and violates public policy due to unjust enrichment (Art. 22, New Civil Code).
    *   **Legal Standard Applied**: Contractual stipulations cannot be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy (Art. 1306, Civil Code).  The Court highlights the principle of *Nemo cum alteris detrimento locupletari potest*.
    *   **Employee Payment and Resale**: Margallo made the down payment, a significant portion of the monthly amortizations, and then the car was resold to another employee after her resignation.
    *   **Potential Risk**: The Employer's attempt to retain payments without transferring ownership of the asset is deemed exploitative and punitive, potentially setting a precedent against similar forfeiture clauses in employee benefits programs.
    *   **Case Law**: *Baguio Country Club vs. NLRC, 206 SCRA 643*;*Hulst v. PR Builders, Inc., G.R. No. 156364, 3 September 2007, 532 SCRA 74, 96*; *Chieng v. Santos, G.R. No. 169647, 31 August 2007, 531 SCRA 730, 747-748*; *Pier 8 Arrastre and Stevedoring Services, Inc. v. Boclot, G.R. No. 173849, 28 September 2007, 534 SCRA 431, 442-447*

*   **Unpaid Sales Commissions:** The SC affirmed the award of unpaid sales commissions. The employer carries the burden of proving payment of wages and benefits *Arco Metal Products Co., Inc. v. Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Arco Metal-NAFLU (SAMARM-NAFLU), G.R. No. 170734, 14 May 2008, 554 SCRA 110, 120*; *De Guzman v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 167701, 12 December 2007, 540 SCRA 21, 35*;
    *   **Employer's Burden of Proof**: The Employer failed to present evidence (company records) to substantiate its claim that the sales were unpaid and thus, commissions were not due.  Adverse presumption applies for failure to present documents in their possession *National Semiconductor (HK) Distribution, Ltd. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 353 Phil. 551, 558 (1998)*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:** Refund Margallo's car loan payments.  Pay the unpaid sales commission.
*   **Employer's Potential Liabilities**: Adverse cost and legal precedent.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The forfeiture clause in the car loan agreement could be considered an illegal means to restrict an employee's right to resign freely.
*   Employer's reliance on a general company policy regarding sales commissions that was not clearly communicated and consistently applied.
*   The ambiguity surrounding the "reward" nature of the car loan program and the employer's inconsistent arguments about its purpose.
