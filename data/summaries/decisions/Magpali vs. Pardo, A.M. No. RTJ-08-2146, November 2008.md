**Case Summary: Magpali v. Judge Pardo (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2146)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Moises M. Pardo for violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically bias/partiality and delay in handling a Support and Alimony Pendente Lite case (Civil Case No. 659-2007).

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **Complainant (Mely Hansor Magpali)** alleged that Judge Pardo (respondent), a friend of her husband (defendant in the civil case), exhibited bias in favor of her husband, made prejudicial remarks, and unduly delayed the hearing of her case.
*   **Respondent (Judge Pardo)** denied the allegations, stating he issued no biased orders and the delay was due to complainant's failure to request a pre-trial hearing. He later inhibited himself from the case.

**Findings and Obligations:**

*   **Lack of Evidence of Bias:** The OCA (Office of the Court Administrator) found insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim of bias or pre-judgment.  The burden of proof rests on the complainant (Adajar v. Develos, A.M. No. P-05-2056) which was not met.  Mere allegations are insufficient (Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 116181).
*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law:** The Supreme Court concurred with the OCA that Judge Pardo was liable for gross ignorance of the law. This arose from his incorrect assertion that the complainant was solely responsible for initiating the pre-trial setting.
*   **Duty to be Proficient:** The court emphasized the judiciary's standard for judicial competence and diligence (Lim v. Dumlao, 454 SCRA 196), citing that judges have the duty to be proficient in the law and to be abreast of legal developments (Ualat v. Judge Ramos, 333 Phil. 175; Grieve v. Jaca, 421 SCRA 117).
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC (Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures):** Established the correct procedure for pre-trial settings, mandating the plaintiff to move *ex parte* for pre-trial within 5 days of the reply filing, failing which the Branch COC should issue a notice of pre-trial.  The respondent judge's ignorance of this rule was the basis for the finding of gross ignorance of the law.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Pardo was fined P10,000.00 for gross ignorance of the law.
*   A stern warning was issued regarding any future repetition of the offense.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the administrative case concluded with a finding of gross ignorance, there could be potential collateral effects on the civil case itself (Civil Case No. 659-2007) depending on the actions taken by the judge before his inhibition, although the SC has not explicitly addressed any adverse impact on the civil case.
*   The order of inhibition can have legal repercussions, and while it was likely intended to show lack of bias, it could be interpreted as an admission of impropriety by an adverse party.
