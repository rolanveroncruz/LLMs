**A.C. No. 6505: Uy v. Saño - Summary for Legal Analysis**

**Subject:** Disbarment case against Atty. Emmanuel P. Saño for unauthorized notarization.

**Key Facts:**
*   Complainant Jessica C. Uy filed a disbarment case against Atty. Saño for notarizing a Deed of Absolute Sale (dated December 7, 2001) when his notarial commission had expired.
*   Atty. Saño admits he lacked a valid commission for 2000-2002 but claims he believed it was renewed through an office aide's representation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Prohibits unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Canon 7, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Directs lawyers to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.
*   **Notarial Law Violation:** Performing notarial acts without a valid commission is a direct violation of this law and the lawyer's oath.

**Liabilities:**
*   **Malpractice and Gross Misconduct:** Notarizing documents without a valid commission.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** Possible falsification of public documents.

**Penalties:**
*   **Suspension from practice of law:** Atty. Saño was suspended for six (6) months.
*   **Revocation of Notarial Commission:** Current commission (if any) revoked.
*   **Disqualification from reappointment:** Disqualified from being a Notary Public for two (2) years.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Flores vs. Lozada, 21 SCRA 1267:** Established that notarizing documents after the lawyer's commission as notary public had expired is malpractice and gross misconduct.
*   **Gutierrez vs. Zulueta, 187 SCRA 607:** Stated that lawyers cannot avoid disciplinary action by simply attributing the problem to his aide/secretary or employee.
*   **Buensuceso v. Barrera, 216 SCRA 309:** Used as precedent for imposing a penalty for unauthorized notarization, even with mitigating circumstances.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Reliance on Staff:**  Atty. Saño's reliance on an office aide raises questions about due diligence and oversight. The court found this defense unpersuasive, emphasizing the lawyer's personal responsibility to verify the commission's validity.
*   **Extent of Unauthorized Notarization:** The decision acknowledges the possibility that Atty. Saño may have notarized other documents without authority during the two-year period, which could lead to further complaints or investigations.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The court WARNED Atty. Saño that any similar act or infraction in the future shall be dealt with more severely.

**Legal Analysis Points:**
*   **Breach of Duty:**  The core issue is Atty. Saño's breach of his duty to uphold the law and maintain the integrity of the legal profession.
*   **Lack of Due Diligence:** His failure to personally verify his notarial commission renewal demonstrated a lack of due diligence and a disregard for the importance of the notarial function.
*   **Proportionality of Penalty:** While the IBP recommended a harsher penalty, the Supreme Court reduced it to a 6-month suspension, seemingly considering the initial reliance on the office aide and the fact that only one unauthorized notarization was presented as evidence.  However, the potential for other, undocumented violations remains a concern.
