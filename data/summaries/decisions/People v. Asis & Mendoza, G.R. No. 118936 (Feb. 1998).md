**Case Summary: *People vs. Asis***

**Citation:** 349 Phil. 736 (1998)

**Facts:** Lorenzo Asis and Romeo Mendoza were charged with Murder for the death of Ernesto Maningas, based on witness testimony placing them with the victim before his death, discovery of their bloodstained clothing and admission of involvement. The lower court convicted Asis and Mendoza of Murder. Mendoza withdrew his appeal.

**Key Holding:** The Supreme Court modified the RTC decision, downgrading Asis's conviction from Murder to Homicide, due to the absence of any qualifying circumstance. The court emphasized the need for proving abuse of superior strength consciously sought by the assailants and that treachery cannot be presumed; manner of attack has to be proven.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Court acknowledged that conviction can rest on circumstantial evidence, citing *Section 4, Rule 133, Revised Rules of Court* on the requisites of circumstancial evidence
*   **Alibi:** The court rejected Asis's alibi, citing precedent that requires an impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime. *People vs. Sumaoy, 263 SCRA 460 (1996)*
*   **Qualifying Circumstances (Murder):** The court found the prosecution failed to prove any circumstance qualifying the killing as murder.
    *   **Abuse of Superior Strength:**  Mere numerical superiority isn't sufficient; conscious intent to exploit superior strength must be shown. *People vs. Daquipil, 240 SCRA 314, 332-333 (1995)*
    *   **Treachery:** The manner of attack must be proven, and cannot be inferred from the results of the crime. *People v. Silvestre, 244 SCRA 479 (1995)*
*   **Reclassification of Crime:**  Absent a qualifying circumstance, the Court reclassified the offense to Homicide.

**Result:** Asis's conviction was modified from Murder to Homicide, and the sentence was reduced to an indeterminate sentence of 10 years of *prision mayor* to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Findings of Lower Court:** The Supreme Court relies on the factual findings of the lower court, which could be challenged on appeal.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court didn't expressly address the mitigating circumstances (voluntary surrender) in the case, because of Mendoza withdrawing his appeal.
