Here's a legal summary of the document:

**Case:** *Pentagon Steel Corporation v. Court of Appeals, National Labor Relations Commission and Perfecto Balogo*, G.R. No. 174141, June 26, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming, with modification, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decision regarding illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The central issue is whether respondent Perfecto Balogo was illegally dismissed.
    *   Petitioner argues Balogo abandoned his job (AWOL).
    *   Respondent argues he was constructively dismissed after returning from a medical leave and being denied return to work.
*   **Abandonment:** The Court reiterated the two-pronged test for abandonment: (1) unjustified failure to report to work, and (2) clear intent to sever the employer-employee relationship. *Lambo v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 111042, October 26, 1999, 317 SCRA 420; Dagupan Bus Company v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 94291, November 9, 1990, 191 SCRA 328.* The burden of proving abandonment rests on the employer.
*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The Court found constructive dismissal occurred when the employer refused to allow the employee to return after a valid medical leave, citing *Hyatt Taxi Services, Inc. v. Catinoy, G.R. No. 143204, June 26, 2001, 359 SCRA 686.*

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The Court upheld the CA ruling that Pentagon Steel Corporation is liable for:
    *   Reinstatement of Perfecto Balogo to his former position or equivalent.
    *   Payment of full backwages, inclusive of allowances and benefits, from the time compensation was withheld until actual reinstatement (Article 279 of the Labor Code).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Strained Relations" Doctrine:** The NLRC initially awarded separation pay due to strained relations, but the CA overturned this. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding that strained relations must be proven and not presumed. *Industrial Corporation v. Morales, G.R. No. 161158, May 9, 2005, 458 SCRA 339,347 citing Procter and Gamble Philippines v. Bondesto, G.R. No. 139847, March 5, 2004, 425 SCRA 1.*
*   **Admissibility of Conciliation Proceedings:** The CA erred by considering statements made during conciliation proceedings. Article 233 of the Labor Code makes such communications privileged and inadmissible as evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Article 233 of the Labor Code:** Defines privileged communication during conciliation proceedings.
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Defines the remedies for illegally dismissed employees (reinstatement and backwages).

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision that Pentagon Steel illegally dismissed Perfecto Balogo. The company is obligated to reinstate Balogo and pay full backwages. The "strained relations" defense was rejected due to lack of evidence, making reinstatement the appropriate remedy.
