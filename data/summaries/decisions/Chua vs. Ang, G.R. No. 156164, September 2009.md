**Case Summary: *Sps. Leonardo and Milagros Chua vs. Hon. Jacinto G. Ang, et al.* (G.R. No. 156164, September 04, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari assailing the City Prosecutor of Pasig's resolution dismissing a complaint for violation of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957 ("The Subdivision and Condominium Buyers Protective Decree").

**Key Provisions of P.D. No. 957 at Issue:**

*   **Section 17:** Registration of Contracts to Sell.
*   **Section 20:** Time of Completion of development.
*   **Section 39:** Penalties for violation, including fines and/or imprisonment, making corporate officers criminally liable.

**Factual Background:**

*   Petitioners (buyers) entered into a Contract to Sell with Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. (FEPI, developer) for a condominium unit.
*   FEPI failed to construct and deliver the unit after three years.
*   Petitioners filed a Complaint-Affidavit against private respondents (officers and directors of FEPI) alleging violations of Sections 17 and 20 in relation to Section 39 of P.D. No. 957 (failure to construct, deliver, and register the contract).
*   The City Prosecutor dismissed the complaint, reasoning that the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) has exclusive jurisdiction over real estate business and practices.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted the petition, reversing the City Prosecutor's resolution and ordering the complaint returned for determination of probable cause.

**Key Legal Issues and Reasoning:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The central issue is whether the City Prosecutor erred in deferring to HLURB jurisdiction on criminal violations of P.D. No. 957. The Court held the City Prosecutor committed grave abuse of discretion.
*   **HLURB vs. Prosecutor Jurisdiction:**
    *   The Court distinguished HLURB's quasi-judicial authority (under P.D. No. 1344 and Section 3 of P.D. No. 957) to regulate real estate trade and business, resolve contractual disputes, and impose administrative fines (Section 38 of P.D. No. 957). *See Arranza v. B. F. Homes, Inc., G.R. No. 131683, June 19, 2000, 333 SCRA 799.*
    *   Importantly, P.D. No. 957 *does not* vest HLURB with jurisdiction to impose criminal penalties under Section 39. *Antipolo Realty Corporation v. National Housing Authority, No. L-50444, August 31, 1987, 153 SCRA 399, 407.*
    *   The Court cited Section 2, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, regarding the determination of probable cause, which falls under the purview of prosecutors, judges, and other officers authorized by law.
*   **Independence of Administrative and Criminal Actions:** The Court emphasized that administrative cases are generally independent of criminal actions. *People v. Toledano, G.R. No. 110220, May 18, 2000, 332 SCRA 210, 216-217; Larin v. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 112745, October 16, 1997, 280 SCRA 713, 727; see also Barillo v. Gervacio, G.R. No. 155088, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 561, 572.* Absent express statutory language requiring administrative determination before criminal prosecution (e.g., unfair labor practices under Article 247, Labor Code), the prosecutor should have made a determination of probable cause.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The public prosecutors evaded their positive duty under Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court and Republic Act No. 5180 (Uniform Procedure of Preliminary Investigation). *Deutsche Bank Manila v. Chua Yok See, G.R. No. 165606, February 6, 2006, 481 SCRA 672, 692; Perez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 162580, January 27, 2006, 480 SCRA 411, 416.*
*   **Procedural Lapses:** The Court recognized the Petitioners filed directly with the Supreme Court, without exhausting administrative remedies or observing the hierarchy of courts. However, exceptions were made because (1) a pure question of law existed, (2) public interest (housing) was involved, (3) prompt action was required, and (4) the case had been pending for a long time.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Corporate Officer Liability:** The case reinforces the personal criminal liability of corporate officers for violations of P.D. No. 957. This raises the stakes for officers and directors of real estate developers.
*   **Future Litigation:** The decision clarifies jurisdictional lines but could lead to an increase in criminal complaints against developers.
*   **Precedent:** The Court cautioned against treating its direct intervention as a precedent, emphasizing that the case's unique circumstances warranted bypassing normal procedural channels.

**Recommendations:**

*   Advise developer clients to ensure strict compliance with P.D. No. 957, particularly regarding registration of contracts, project completion timelines, and advertising claims.
*   Inform corporate officers about their potential personal criminal liability.
*   In defending similar cases, argue based on specific facts to distinguish from the peculiar circumstances that justified direct Supreme Court intervention in this case.
