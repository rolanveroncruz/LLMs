**Legal Document Summary: Spouses Sanchez vs. Aguilar et al. (G.R. No. 228680)**

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) appealing the CA's reversal of the RTC's annulment of an MCTC decision.

**Facts:** This case concerns a land dispute between Spouses Sanchez (Petitioners) and the Heirs of Aguilar (Respondents) regarding a 600-square-meter lot purchased by the Spouses Sanchez from Juanito Aguilar. The core issue is whether the Spouses Sanchez are entitled to an alleged alluvium abutting Lake Sebu, adjacent to their purchased lot. The Heirs of Aguilar fenced off a portion of land they claimed was theirs, leading to the initial Forcible Entry suit in the MCTC, which ruled in favor of the Heirs of Aguilar. The MCTC decision also found that the land in question could be a foreshore or salvage zone.  The Spouses then filed for annulment of the MCTC judgment alleging lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Deed of Sale Interpretation:** Conflicting descriptions in the deed of sale (600 sq. meters vs. boundary being the lake) led to dispute of the boundaries. The MCTC decision favored the former, but the RTC favored the latter, due to the survey results.
*   **Alluvium Rights (Art. 457, Civil Code):** The Spouses Sanchez claim ownership of the alleged alluvium formation as an accretion to their land. The Heirs of Aguilar deny the existence of an alluvium and assert prior possession. The MCTC questioned if alluvium could occur in a lake, and considered if the land was a foreshore or salvage zone for public use.
*   **MCTC Jurisdiction:** The Spouses Sanchez challenged the MCTC's jurisdiction claiming it made judgment over a non-existent parcel of land. The CA and SC ultimately held that the MCTC *did* have jurisdiction over the forcible entry case as prescribed in R.A. 7691.
*   **Forcible Entry (Rule 70, Rules of Court):** The original action was for forcible entry. MCTC found Heirs of Aguilar in prior possession.
*   **Annulment of Judgment (Rule 47, Rules of Court):** The Spouses Sanchez sought annulment of the MCTC judgment based on alleged lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reiterated that annulment is an exceptional remedy available only with a showing of lack of jurisdiction or extrinsic fraud, where other remedies are unavailable.
*   **Laches:** The CA and SC ruled that the Spouses Sanchez's action for annulment was barred by laches, due to the four-year delay in filing the complaint after the MCTC decision and its partial execution.

**Obligations:**

*   **Spouses Sanchez:** Burden to prove alluvium formation and entitlement; obligation to timely pursue remedies (appeal or annulment).
*   **Heirs of Aguilar:** Duty to respect lawful rights and interests of the Spouses Sanchez to the extent that they exist and are proven.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Sanchez:** Loss of claim to the alleged alluvium; potential liability for costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Survey Results:** Discrepancies in the measurement of the national highway's width, and how the parties were affected by these discrepancies.
*   **Determination of Alluvium vs. Foreshore Land:** Lack of clear determination of the nature of the land abutting the lake. Alluvium would accrue to private owner, foreshore land is owned by the state.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari
*   **Rule 47, Rules of Court:** Annulment of Judgments
*   **Rule 70, Rules of Court:** Forcible Entry
*   **R.A. 7691:** Jurisdiction of Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts.
*   **Art. 457, Civil Code:** Ownership of alluvium
*   ***Pinasukan Seafood House, Roxas Blvd.,, Inc. v. Far East Bank & Trust Company (now Bank of the Philippine Islands)*** 725 Phil. 19, 31 (2014): reiterating the exceptional nature of annulment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA decision. The Spouses Sanchez's claim failed due to laches and their inability to prove lack of jurisdiction of the MCTC. This case emphasizes the importance of timely pursuing remedies and clearly establishing the legal basis for claims to land accretion.
