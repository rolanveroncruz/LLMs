## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 171399

**Case Name:** Vicenta Cantemprate, et al. vs. CRS Realty Development Corporation, et al.

**Court & Date:** Supreme Court, Second Division, May 8, 2009 (605 Phil. 574)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision, which affirmed the OP decision adopting HLURB's decision dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.  Deals with specific performance, delivery of titles, and double sale in a subdivision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Contracts to Sell:** Petitioners (lot buyers) entered into contracts to sell with CRS Realty (developer) and paid in full.  Respondents (CRS Realty, Cesar Casal, Crisanta Salvador, Bennie Cuason, Caleb Ang) failed to deliver titles.
*   **Lack of License to Sell:**  The Court held that lack of a license to sell by CRS Realty *does not* render the contracts void, citing *Co Chien v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.* It only subjects the seller to administrative and criminal liability under P.D. No. 957. A perfected contract of sale exists.
*   **HLURB Jurisdiction:** The HLURB *has* jurisdiction over actions for specific performance compelling delivery of titles under P.D. No. 1344 and Section 25 of P.D. No. 957. The Court affirms HLURB Arbiter's findings on this point. Specifically, the owner/developer has a statutory obligation to deliver the title upon full payment.
*   **Pending Litigation & Lis Pendens:** A pending RTC case (Civil Case No. BCV-90-14) between Casal (original landowner) and the Heirs of Laudiza with a notice of lis pendens affects the titles.
*   **Obligations & Liabilities:** The Court orders CRS Realty, Casal, and Salvador jointly and severally to deliver *clean* titles to the petitioners within six months.  If this is not possible, they must pay actual damages equivalent to the *current market value* of the lots as determined by the HLURB, citing *Solid Homes, Inc. v. Spouses Tan.*. The award of moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, and administrative fines are affirmed.
*   **Subsequent Sale (Double Sale):** The alleged sale of the same lots to Cuason and Ang is a key point.  The HLURB must determine if this constitutes a double sale and was tainted with fraud under P.D. 1344 Section 1.
*   **Validity of Transfers:**  The HLURB Arbiter had previously nullified the transfer to Ang and Cuason, but the Court focuses on the *potential* breach.
*   **Quieting of Title/Reconveyance:** HLURB does *not* have jurisdiction over actions for quieting of title or reconveyance (Spouses Suntay v. Gocolay), which are under the jurisdiction of the RTC per Section 19 of B.P. Blg. 129.
*   **Relativity of Contracts:**  The agreement between Casal and Salvador cannot affect third parties (the buyers/petitioners).
* **Due Process:** The OP’s reference to the HLURB decision does not violate the constitutional requirement for a valid decision, based on expediency, practicality, and convenience per existing case law.
* **Obligations for delivery of titles cannot be avoided by "passing the buck."**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Clean Title" Definition:**  The term "clean title" requires further clarification regarding existing encumbrances and the necessary steps to remove them. Litigation with the Heirs of Laudiza is a complicating factor.
*   **Valuation:**  Determining the "current market value" of the lots could be contentious and require significant expert testimony.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the order against CRS Realty, given its financial situation and potential dissolution, could be challenging. Salvador being "one of the officers" will need to be established via legal determination to hold her solidarily liable.
*   **Lis Pendens Cancellation:** Even with a valid deed of sale, the legal implications of an annotated "Lis Pendens" can result in major encumbrances to the right of ownership of the property, and can ultimately result in the nullification of the deed itself.

**Statutory References:**

*   P.D. No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree)
*   P.D. No. 1344 (Empowering the National Housing Authority to Issue Writs of Execution)
*   B.P. Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980)
*   Civil Code of the Philippines, Articles 1191, 1458, 2199, 2200

**Case Law:**

*   *Co Chien v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.*
*   *Spouses Suntay v. Gocolay*
*   *Solid Homes, Inc. v. Spouses Tan*

**Recommendations:**

*   Assess the current status of Civil Case No. BCV-90-14 to understand the implications for title clearing.
*   Gather evidence of the current market value of the lots.
*   Investigate the financial status of CRS Realty and the individual respondents to assess the likelihood of recovering actual damages.
*   Prepare for potential litigation concerning the determination of "clean title" and the removal of encumbrances.
*   Gather documentation that establishes Salvador as "one of the officers" to enforce solidary liability.
