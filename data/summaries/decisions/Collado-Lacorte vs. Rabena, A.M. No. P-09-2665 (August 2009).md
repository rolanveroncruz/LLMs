**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-09-2665**

**Subject:** Administrative case against Eduardo Rabena, Process Server, for improper service of summons.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complaint Origin:** Judge Francisco Ante, Jr., MTCC, Vigan City, reported improper service by Rabena in Civil Case No. 07-29131 (Moneyline Lending Investors Inc. v. Abero & Rabena), assigned to Judge Collado-Lacorte, MTCC, Caloocan City.
*   **Improper Service:** Rabena's officer's return indicated substituted service on defendants Abero and Rabena through relatives, without detailing the failed attempts at personal service as required by the Rules of Court.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Judge Collado-Lacorte found the substituted service improper, resulting in the court's lack of jurisdiction over the defendants and ordered an Alias Summons.
*   **Rabena's Explanation:** Rabena claimed the defendant Ernesto R. Rabena refused service, and Rowell Mark D. Abero was unlocatable. He stated he attempted to deliver the summons to Abero's mother, but she refused.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended re-docketing as a regular administrative matter, finding Rabena guilty of simple neglect of duty, fining him P5,000.00, and issuing a stern warning.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) agreed with the OCA's findings.

**Obligations:**

*   Process Servers have a duty to serve court notices with utmost diligence, ensuring due service on parties.
*   Compliance with Rule 14, Section 8 (formerly) of the Rules of Court regarding service of summons, particularly substituted service, is mandatory. The details of attempted personal service and reasons for failure must be documented in the return.

**Liabilities:**

*   Rabena was found liable for simple neglect of duty, defined as failure to give proper attention to a required task resulting from carelessness or indifference.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Misconduct:** Any repetition of similar negligent acts could lead to more severe penalties.
*   **Jurisdictional Issues:** Improper service of summons can lead to a lack of personal jurisdiction, potentially invalidating court proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Ma. Imelda M. Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 130974:** This case, extensively cited in the decision, emphasizes the extraordinary nature of substituted service and the strict compliance required for valid service. It also outlines the requirement to document specific details of attempted personal service in the return.
*   **Zenauda Musni v. Ernesto G. Morales, A.M. No. P-99-1340:** This highlights the critical role of process servers in notifying defendants and establishing court jurisdiction, emphasizing the need for expeditious service.
*   **Rodrigo-Ebron v. Adolfo, 522 SCRA 286:** This reiterates the utmost dedication required of process servers in serving court notices.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Section 8 (formerly) of the Rules of Court:** Governs substituted service of summons.
*   **Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations:** Defines and prescribes penalties for simple neglect of duty.
*   **Sec. 19, Rule XIV of the same Rules:** States that a penalty of a fine may also be imposed in the alternative.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5 dated November 9, 1989:** Requires a statement of efforts to find the defendant personally and the failure of those efforts in the proof of service.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "reasonable time" for attempting personal service is not explicitly defined in the Rules, leading to some ambiguity. The SC uses "reasonable time" to mean no more than seven (7) days for the plaintiff, 15-30 days for the sheriff.
*   The level of effort required to demonstrate "impossibility of prompt service" can be subjective, though the Court provides that "several attempts" mean at least three (3) tries, preferably on at least two different dates.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of strict compliance with the Rules of Court regarding service of summons. Process servers must diligently attempt personal service, meticulously document their efforts, and provide detailed explanations in their returns to avoid liability for neglect of duty. Failure to do so can jeopardize court jurisdiction and lead to administrative penalties.
