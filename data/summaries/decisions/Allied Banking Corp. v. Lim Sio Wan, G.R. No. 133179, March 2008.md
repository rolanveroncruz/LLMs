## Legal Document Summary: Allied Banking Corporation v. Lim Sio Wan, et al. (G.R. No. 133179)

**Subject Matter:** Liability for a forged endorsement on a manager's check used to pre-terminate a money market placement.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Money Market Placement as Loan (Art. 1953 & 1980, Civil Code):** Defines the relationship between bank and depositor as debtor-creditor, making the money market placement a simple loan (mutuum).
*   **Extinguishment of Obligations (Art. 1231, Civil Code):**  The bank's obligation to the depositor is only extinguished by payment to the correct party or authorized representative (Art. 1240, Civil Code).  Payment to an unauthorized party (due to a forged instruction) does not extinguish the debt.
*   **Liability of General Indorser (Sec. 66, Negotiable Instruments Law):**  An unqualified indorser warrants the genuineness of the instrument and its endorsements to subsequent holders in due course.
*   **Warranty of Negotiation by Delivery (Sec. 65, Negotiable Instruments Law):** Includes that instrument is genuine and what it purports to be.
*   **Bank Guarantee (Sec. 17, PCHC Rules and Regulations):**  Collecting bank guarantees all prior endorsements and/or lack of endorsement.
*   **Unjust Enrichment (Art. 22, Civil Code):** Requires restitution when someone benefits at another's expense without just cause.

**Obligations:**

*   **Allied Banking Corporation (Allied):** Obligation to repay Lim Sio Wan's (LSW) money market placement as the debt was never extinguished due to the unauthorized pre-termination and forged endorsement.
*   **Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (Metrobank):** Duty to verify the authenticity of endorsements before guaranteeing them as the collecting bank. Its guarantee of all prior endorsements makes it liable for the forged endorsement.
*   **Producers Bank:** Obligation to reimburse Allied and Metrobank due to unjust enrichment. The proceeds of LSWâ€™s placement benefited Producers Bank by extinguishing their debt to Filipinas Cement Corporation (FCC).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Allied:** Primarily liable (60%) due to its negligence in issuing the manager's check to an unauthorized person (Deborah Dee Santos) without proper verification of LSW's instructions.
*   **Metrobank:** Secondarily liable (40%) due to its negligence in guaranteeing the forged endorsement as the collecting bank. Metrobank guarantees prior endorsements, but negligence on the part of the issuing bank can shift the responsibility.
*   **Producers Bank:** Liable to Allied and Metrobank for the full amount they are ordered to pay LSW.
*   **Filipinas Cement Corporation:** Not liable because it was entitled to payment from Producers bank and not involved in the negotiation of the check or forgery.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Apportionment of Liability:** The 60/40 split in liability between Allied and Metrobank is contentious. Allied argues Metrobank should bear the full burden as the guarantor of endorsements.
*   **Vicarious Liability:** Allied's attempt to hold Producers Bank liable as the employer of Santos under Art. 2180 of the Civil Code failed because this applies only to quasi-delicts, not civil liability from a crime (of which there was no conviction).
*   **Jurisdiction over Santos:** The court lacks jurisdiction over Deborah Dee Santos, making it impossible to assign her direct liability for the fraud.
*   **Concurrent and Independent Liabilities:** The decision states liabilities are concurrent and independent, meaning each party can be held fully liable despite the apportioned percentages.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Citibank, N.A. v. Sabeniano:** Money market placement is a simple loan or mutuum.
*   **Cebu International Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Definition of a money market.
*   **Republic Bank v. Ebrada, Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Equitable Banking Corporation, Traders Royal Bank v. Radio Philippines Network, Inc., Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals, Associated Bank v. Court of Appeals:** The collecting bank which indorses a check bearing a forged indorsement and presents it to the drawee bank guarantees all prior indorsements.
*   **Reyes v. Lim, Tamio v. Ticson:** Clarify the principle of unjust enrichment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 22, 1231, 1240, 1953, 1980, 2180
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law:** Sections 65, 66
*   **PCHC Rules and Regulations:** Section 17

**Summary of Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision modifying the RTC's ruling. Allied is liable to Lim Sio Wan for the proceeds of the unauthorized money market pre-termination. The liability is apportioned 60% to Allied and 40% to Metrobank based on their respective negligence. Producers Bank must reimburse Allied and Metrobank for the amounts they pay to Lim Sio Wan because they were unjustly enriched.
