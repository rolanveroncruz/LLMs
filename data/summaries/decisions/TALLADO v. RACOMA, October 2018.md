**Legal Document Summary: *Gov. Edgardo A. Tallado v. Hon. Winston S. Racoma*, A.M. No. RTJ-18-2536, October 10, 2018**

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court in an administrative complaint against a Regional Trial Court Judge.

**Parties:**
*   Complainant: Gov. Edgardo A. Tallado
*   Respondent: Hon. Winston S. Racoma, Presiding Judge, Branch 39, RTC, Daet, Camarines Norte

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**
*   **Complaint:** Tallado alleged Gross Ignorance of the Law and Procedure and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct by Judge Racoma. Specific claims include:
    *   Improper admission of Ang's judicial affidavit due to lack of proper attestation required by the Judicial Affidavit Rule.
    *   Violation of Rule 58, Section 4(d) of the Rules of Court for not allowing Tallado and co-respondents to present evidence during TRO hearing.
    *   Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in Civil Case No. 8080 (Ang v. Tallado) without proper basis and with grave abuse of discretion. The TRO was issued to prevent Tallado from implementing Ang's preventive suspension as mayor.
*   **Judge Racoma's Actions:** Issued a TRO in favor of Mayor Agnes D. Ang, effectively halting her preventive suspension.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Initially recommended dismissal of Tallado's complaint due to lack of merit. However, recommended a fine for Judge Racoma for insubordination due to failure to file a comment on the complaint.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   Upheld the OCA's findings and dismissed Tallado's administrative complaint due to lack of evidence showing bad faith, fraud, or corruption on the part of Judge Racoma.  Cited jurisprudence that administrative action is not appropriate for every judicial error, absent malice or ill-will (*Fortune Life Insurance Co., Inc. v. Judge Luczon, Jr.*, 538 Phil. 561, 570 (2006), *Chua v. Judge Madrona*, 742 Phil. 98, 112 (2014) and *Romero v. Judge Luna*, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2303). Errors should be challenged through judicial remedies first.
    *   Found Judge Racoma guilty of Insubordination under Section 9, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court for failing to file his comment on the complaint, despite multiple directives from the OCA.
    *   Imposed a fine of Eleven Thousand Pesos (P11,000.00) on Judge Racoma, considering his prior administrative offenses (Undue Delay in the Rendition of Judgment in A.M. No. RTJ-14-2373 and A.M. No. RTJ-10-2233).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Judicial Discretion vs. Abuse:** The core issue revolves around whether Judge Racoma's issuance of the TRO constituted a legitimate exercise of judicial discretion or an abuse thereof. The court found no evidence of malice, fraud, or corruption, which is required for administrative liability in judicial acts. However, a future court could review these facts and find sufficient evidence to support an ethics complaint.
*   **Insubordination:** Judge Racoma's failure to respond to the OCA's directives is a clear violation of court rules and demonstrates a lack of respect for administrative processes. The fine imposed, while relatively modest, reflects the seriousness of this transgression.
*   **Judicial Affidavit Rule:** The complaint regarding the alleged violation of the Judicial Affidavit Rule could be contentious if the defects were significant and prejudiced the complainant.
*   **"Overtaken by Events" Argument:** The issue of whether the events had overtaken the need for a TRO could have been further litigated. Tallado argued that the suspension and installation of a new mayor had already occurred, rendering the TRO moot. The court did not fully address this argument in the context of the administrative complaint.
