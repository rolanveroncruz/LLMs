**Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Junrel R. Villalobos*, G.R. No. 228960, June 11, 2018 (833 Phil. 123)**

**Case:** Appeal of CA Decision affirming RTC conviction for Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A, RPC:** Defines and penalizes the crime of rape. The information charged Villalobos with carnal knowledge of AAA through force, threats, and intimidation, armed with a handgun.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Damages:**  ₱75,000 civil indemnity, ₱75,000 moral damages, ₱75,000 exemplary damages, plus 6% interest per annum from finality of the judgment.

**Factual Background:**

*   The victim, AAA, alleges that Villalobos entered her home at night, threatened her with a handgun, and forcibly took her to a nearby nipa hut where he committed multiple acts of rape (vaginal and anal penetration, oral sex).
*   Villalobos denies the charges, claiming alibi.
*   The RTC convicted Villalobos based on the credible testimony of AAA and corroborating medical evidence showing contusions and hymenal lacerations.
*   The CA affirmed the conviction, finding the victim's testimony sufficient and rejecting the defense of alibi.

**Obligations:**

*   **Villalobos:** Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay the awarded damages.
*   **State:** Enforce the judgment and ensure Villalobos serves his sentence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:**  Villalobos is criminally liable for rape under Article 266-A of the RPC.
*   **Civil:**  Villalobos is civilly liable to AAA for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, plus interest.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The core issue is the credibility of AAA's testimony versus the defense of alibi. The defense argued that the length of the alleged incident (90 minutes) indicates consent, and that darkness affected the identification of the accused.
*   **Judge Montejo-Gonzaga writing decision:** The judge was not the one to observe the testimony of the witness.
*   **Extortion Claim:** The defense alleged that someone approached him asking for money to have the case withdrawn. If proven, this would indicate malicious prosecution.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A, Revised Penal Code:** Rape.
*   **A.M. No. 04-11-09-SC:** Regarding withholding the names of victims in Violence Against Women cases.
*   **A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC:** Guidelines for using the phrase "without eligibility for parole." The Court notes this phrase is unnecessary here as *reclusion perpetua* is already understood to preclude parole.
*   ***Lumanog, et al. v. People, 644 Phil. 296, 395 (2010).*** The fact alone that the judge who heard the evidence was not the one who rendered the judgment, but merely relied on the record of the case, does not render his judgment erroneous or irregular. 
*   ***People v. Hapa, 413 Phil. 679, 695 (2001).*** To rule otherwise would create an absurd situation wherein, every time the judge who, wholly or partly, heard a case dies or leaves the service, such case cannot be decided and a new trial will have to be conducted for the taking anew of the testimonies of the witnesses by the successor judge.
*   ***People v. Sansaet, 426 Phil. 826, 833 (2002).*** The correctness and efficacy of a decision is not necessarily impaired by the fact that its writer only took over from a colleague who had earlier presided at the trial, unless there is showing of grave abuse of discretion in the factual findings reached by him
*   ***People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016).*** Sets the precedent for the amounts awarded for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in rape cases.
*   ***People v. Diaz, 711 Phil. 227 (2013).*** The testimony of the private complainant to the effect that the rape occurred for a rather long time would not diminish her credibility.
*   Numerous cases cited regarding credibility of victim testimony, identification of the accused, alibi defense, failure to shout for help not indicating consent, and rape occurring over long durations.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact extent of force/intimidation used. The court found sufficient evidence to overcome the lack of shouting or resistance, but the specific details are important.
*   The credibility of the alleged extortion attempt.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Junrel R. Villalobos for Rape based on the credible testimony of the victim, corroborated by medical evidence. The Court rejected the defense's arguments regarding identification, duration of the act, and alibi. The case highlights the importance of victim testimony in rape cases and reinforces the legal principle that a victim's failure to resist does not necessarily indicate consent when force or intimidation is present. The Court upheld the award of damages and interest. Potential risk lies in the factual determination of credibility, but the appellate courts have consistently upheld the RTC's findings.
