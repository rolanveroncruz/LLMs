**Case Summary: People v. Rivera, G.R. No. 177741 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Willie Rivera (Appellant) for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride or *shabu*).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Police officers conducted a buy-bust operation based on information that Appellant ("Kirat") was selling drugs. PO3 Salisa acted as the poseur-buyer.
*   **Marked Money:** Marked P200 bills were used in the buy-bust.
*   **Seizure & Identification:** Appellant handed two sachets containing white crystalline substance to the poseur-buyer. The sachets were marked "EXH-1 AMS" and "EXH-B AMS 03/13/03" by PO3 Salisa.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The sachets were transmitted to the EPD-PNP Crime Laboratory for examination. Police Inspector Lourdeliza M. Gural, Forensic Chemist at the EPD-PNP Crime Laboratory Office examined them and recorded her findings and conclusion in Chemistry Report No. D-455-03-E.
*   **Laboratory Confirmation:** Examination confirmed the sachets contained Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (*shabu*).
*   **Appellant's Defense:** Frame-up and extortion attempt by the police.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:** To comply with drug laws and refrain from selling illegal substances.
*   **Law Enforcement:** To conduct lawful arrests and preserve the integrity of seized evidence according to R.A. 9165 and related implementing rules. Specifically, Section 21, requiring inventory and photography in the presence of the accused or his representative, media, DOJ representative, and elected public official.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165. Sentenced to life imprisonment and fined P500,000.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Appellant argued illegal arrest without warrant. The Court ruled the arrest was valid as he was caught in flagrante delicto (Rule 113, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court). The right to question illegal arrest was waived by submission to the court's jurisdiction.
*   **Section 21 Compliance (R.A. 9165):** Potential risk due to imperfect compliance with Section 21's requirements for inventory and photography of seized drugs. While a spot report was filed with the PDEA and the items were submitted to the crime lab, precise evidence on inventory and photography in presence of required parties was lacking. The Court cited *People v. Pringas* (G.R. No. 175928), stating non-compliance is not necessarily fatal if there is justifiable ground and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. Absence of questioning of the sachets integrity by the defense was a factor.
*   **Lack of specifics in police procedure:** The Court notes that PO3 Salisa's testimony did not indicate if a list of the sachets was made, or if photos were taken. While this was ultimately found acceptable, it's a detail that, with better questioning, could have created reasonable doubt.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Offense of selling dangerous drugs.
*   **Rule 113, Section 5(a), Rules of Court:** Lawful warrantless arrest - in flagrante delicto.
*   **Buenaventura v. People, G.R. No. 171578:** Waiver of illegal arrest claims through submission to the court's jurisdiction.
*   **People v. Bagsit, G.R. No. 148877:** Waiver of objections to illegal arrests if not raised before plea.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87:** Changed SC direct appeal rules.
*   **People v. Pringas, G.R. No. 175928:** Imperfect compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 may not be fatal.
*   **William Ching v. People, G.R. No. 177237** - Appellate courts will not disturb the credence, or lack of it, accorded by the trial court to the testimonies of witnesses.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding no reversible error. The key risk revolves around the proper execution of the chain of custody per Section 21 of R.A. 9165, but the prosecution successfully argued the integrity of the evidence was maintained despite imperfections in compliance. The accused waived the right to question illegal arrest by entering a plea.
