Here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** _Dueñas, Jr. v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) and Reyes_, G.R. No. 185401, July 21, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court challenging HRET Resolution No. 08-353.

**Parties:**
*   Petitioner: Henry "Jun" Dueñas, Jr. (Protestee)
*   Respondents: HRET and Angelito "Jett" P. Reyes (Protestant)

**Facts:**
*   Dueñas and Reyes were rival candidates for Congressman. Dueñas was proclaimed winner.
*   Reyes filed an election protest in the HRET (HRET Case No. 07-27) for revision in 170 precincts (out of 732).
*   Dueñas filed a counter-protest for 560 precincts.
*   The HRET ordered retrieval of all ballot boxes.
*   Preliminary conference: parties agreed to revise all 170 protested precincts without designating pilot precincts.
*   Revision proceeded for 100% of protested precincts and 25% of counter-protested precincts. Case submitted for resolution.
*   HRET ordered continuation of revision for remaining 75% counter-protested precincts, citing Rule 88 and discovery of "fake/spurious ballots."
*   Dueñas moved for reconsideration (denied).
*   HRET ordered Dueñas to augment his cash deposit (P320,000) (to cover expenses of revision of remaining 75% precincts).
*   Dueñas filed a motion to withdraw/abandon remaining 75% counter-protested precincts.
*   HRET denied this motion in Resolution No. 08-353 and ordered use of HRET funds for revision.

**Central Issue:** Did the HRET commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing Resolution No. 08-353 (denying Dueñas's motion to withdraw the counter-protest and ordering revision using HRET funds)?

**Petitioner's Arguments (Dueñas):**
1.  Reyes failed to prove his case in the protested precincts; the protest should have been dismissed. Continuing the revision gives Reyes an undeserved chance and compromises the HRET's impartiality.
2.  Dueñas has the right to withdraw his counter-protest. The counter-protest is meant to protect his interests, not benefit Reyes.
3.  Using HRET funds for revision benefits a private party (Reyes) and is an illegal/unconstitutional disbursement under Section 29(1), Article VI of the Constitution. The HRET funds should not be used to speculate if the failed Protestant can win.
4.  Rule 88 discretion can only be exercised if initial revision "reasonably affected" results. No such determination was made. Number of "fake/spurious" ballots found was insignificant (75 ballots, about 5% of his lead).
5. There was no substantial change in the votes of the parties after the initial revision.

**Respondent's Arguments (HRET & Reyes):**
1.  No grave abuse of discretion. Discovery of "fake/spurious ballots" justifies continuation of revision. HRET must ferret out the truth.
2.  Rule 88 gives HRET discretion to continue revision. Motion to withdraw doesn't divest HRET of jurisdiction.
3.  HRET can use its funds as incident to discretion under Rule 88 and its plenary powers.
4.  Sufficient and legitimate reason to proceed (discovery of fake/spurious ballots creates doubt).
5.  Withdrawal of revision is not a vested right, gives way to public interest. HRET has plenary power to review ballots *motu proprio*.
6.  Funds are allotted under RA 9498, General Appropriations Act.

**Ruling:** Petition dismissed. HRET Resolution No. 08-353 affirmed.

**Rationale:**
1.  HRET is "sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications" of members of the House. Court's power of review is limited.
2.  The HRET's actions were within the bounds of its authority and discretion.
3.  The HRET did not abuse its power to deny motion to withdraw counter-protest.
4.  There was no point in continuing the revision of the remaining 75% of the counter-protested precincts because notwithstanding the revision of 100% of the protested precincts and 25% of the counter-protested precincts, the petitioner's margin over the private respondent was still more than a thousand votes.
5.  The HRET’s declaration of its failure to ascertain the true will of the electorate after the revision of 100% of the protested precincts had been completed clearly demonstrated that Reyes failed in his bid. 
6.  Constitution grants the HRET the power to be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of members of the House of Representatives
7.  Constitution is emphatic that the jurisdiction of the HRET in the adjudication of election contests involving its members is exclusive and exhaustive
8.  The Court will not correct the perceived errors of independent branches of the Government.
9.  The HRET has discretion under Rule 88 to continue or discontinue revision proceedings *ex propio motu*.
10. Jurisdiction, once acquired, continues until the case is terminated (Robles v. HRET).
11. Discretion of HRET to use its own funds in revision proceedings is valid - implied power necessary to make its authority effective and not barred by RA 9498.
12. Using the funds is not a giving of unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference to a party since the benefit would actually redound to the electorate whose true will must be determined.

**Dissenting Opinions:**
*   Justice Quisumbing dissented, arguing HRET's discretion under Rule 88 is not unbridled and was abused. The results of the initial revision did not reasonably affect the proclaimed results. The number of fake/spurious ballots was insignificant. The HRET gave a party an unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference in the discharge of their judicial functions through manifest partiality.

*   Justice Nachura joined in the dissent. The HRET would violate Article 220 of the Revised Penal Code, and even risk likely prosecution under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.

**Key Provisions & Rules:**
*   Section 17, Article VI, Constitution (HRET as sole judge).
*   Rule 88, 2004 HRET Rules (Pilot Precincts; Initial Revision).
*   Rule 7 and 8, HRET Rules
*   Rule 33, HRET Rules
*   Rule 28 of the 2004 HRET Rules
*   Section 29 (1), Article VI of the Constitution (appropriations).
*   RA 9498, General Appropriations Act.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Rule 88 Interpretation:** The scope of the HRET's discretion under Rule 88 is a contentious point, particularly regarding the "reasonably affected" threshold. The dissent argues the HRET stretched its discretion.
*   **HRET Funding:** The legality of using HRET's general funds for the extended revision is questionable, especially in light of arguments regarding the HRET's constitutional mandate and separation of powers.
*   **Precedent:** The ruling provides a potentially broad interpretation of the HRET's powers, which could lead to future challenges regarding its actions in election contests.
*   **Finality Concerns:** The dissenting opinions raise concerns about the HRET's finality and the potential for abuse if its decisions are not subject to reasonable constraints.
*   There may be risks of likely prosecution under Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, by causing undue injury to the Government and giving a party an unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference in the discharge of their judicial functions through manifest partiality.
