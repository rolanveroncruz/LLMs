**Case:** *National Transmission Corporation v. Ma. Magdalena Lourdes Lacson-De Leon, et al.*, G.R. No. 221624, July 4, 2018 (835 Phil. 686)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA Decision and Resolution regarding just compensation in an expropriation case.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Expropriation Purpose:** NAPOCOR (now TRANSCO) sought an easement of right-of-way for a transmission line (Bacolod-Cadiz 138 KV SC/ST Transmission Line) over a 39,347 sq. m. portion of land owned by respondents in Bacolod City.
*   **Just Compensation:**
    *   **Valuation Date:** Determined as of the filing of the complaint (February 28, 2002), which was earlier than the taking.  *Section 4, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court*.
    *   **Land Classification:**  The Court upheld the RTC/CA decision to classify the land as residential based on the City Planning and Development Office certification, overriding tax declarations. The Supreme Court reiterated that the power to reclassify lands rests with the local government, citing *NAPOCOR v. Marasigan, G.R. No. 220367, 20 November 2017*.  The Court's classification is solely for determining just compensation.
    *   **Valuation Methodology:** Rejected the board of commissioners' average price from dissimilar subdivisions.  SCOTUS pegs the valuation at PhP600.00 per square meter, based on the raw land value of a similar residential property (Montinola Subdivision).
*   **Consequential Damages:**
    *   **Basis:** Awarded due to the impairment of the remaining property's value because of the transmission lines.
    *   **Amount:** Reduced to 50% of the BIR zonal valuation (PhP17.50/sqm) of the 310,908 sq. m. segregated area (PhP2,720,445.00), based on *NAPOCOR v. Marasigan*. The court deemed the earlier 10% of FMV as lacking a concrete basis.
*   **Interest:**
    *   **Rate:** 12% per annum from the date of taking (February 2, 2004) to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment, consistent with *Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation v. Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. 218628, 6 September 2017*.
    *   **Applicability:**  Applied to both just compensation and consequential damages, citing *NAPOCOR v. Marasigan*.
*   **No Attorney Fees:** The Court of Appeals denied the attorney's fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   TRANSCO is obligated to pay the respondents:
    *   Just compensation: PhP23,608,200.00 (PhP600/sqm * 39,347 sqm)
    *   Consequential damages: PhP2,720,445.00 (50% BIR ZV * 310,908 sqm)
    *   Interest as specified above.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Zonal Valuation Disputes:** Although the BIR zonal valuation was used to compute consequential damages, there could be disputes if the actual market value of the affected area significantly deviates from this.
*   **Factual Determinations:** Remand for evidence reception was avoided for expediency.
*   **Enforcement:** TRANSCO's ability to fulfill the significant financial obligations is assumed. If they're unable, they might be subject to additional penalties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, Section 4:**  Governs expropriation proceedings and the determination of just compensation.
*   **Republic Act No. 8974:**  Facilitates acquisition of right-of-way for national government infrastructure projects.
*   ***NAPOCOR v. Marasigan***: Used as precedent for consequential damages calculation (50% BIR ZV) and classification of property based on local government certification.
*   ***Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation v. Republic***: Used as precedent for the changing interest rate of just compensation.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Regarding the imposition of interest rates and delays in payment of just compensation.
*   ***Republic v. Mupas***: Pertaining to the imposition of interest rates on just compensation.

**Note:** While the court endeavored to determine just compensation based on available records, factual disputes could still arise during implementation and payment.
