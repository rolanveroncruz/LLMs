Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Alex Oliano y Pugong* (G.R. No. 119013, March 6, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Alex Oliano of murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** Oliano was accused of fatally shooting Benjamin Matias.  The key prosecution witness, Matias's wife, Rosita, positively identified Oliano as the shooter.  The defense presented an alibi and a negative paraffin test result for Oliano.

**RTC Ruling:** Found Oliano guilty of murder, sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, and ordered him to pay damages to the victim's heirs.

**Appellant's Argument:**  The RTC erred in finding Oliano guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  He challenged the credibility of the eyewitness, Rosita Matias, alleging bias and "psychological predisposition" due to prior remarks. He also challenged the widow's account of the events that night.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction, but modified the damages.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Art. 248, RPC (Murder):** Defines the crime of murder, establishing the basis for Oliano's conviction. The presence of Treachery makes it qualify as Murder.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Emphasizes the trial court's superior position in assessing witness credibility. Cites *People vs. Pontilar, Jr.* and others.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):**  The Court found the presence of treachery, based on the sudden, unexpected attack on an unarmed victim. Citing *People vs. Abrenica* (252 SCRA 54,62, January 18, 1996) and *People vs. Vallado* (257 SCRA 515, 527, June 20, 1996)
*   **Alibi:**  The Court dismissed the alibi as not credible, noting the proximity of the crime scene to Oliano's claimed location.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Civil Indemnity (P50,000):** Affirmed, consistent with jurisprudence.
    *   **Actual Damages (P10,000):**  Deleted due to lack of sufficient evidentiary proof (receipts or other supporting documents).  Cites *People vs. Degoma*
    *   **Moral Damages (P30,000):** Deleted due to lack of proof of suffering or anguish.
    *   **Temperate Damages (P10,000):**  Awarded in lieu of actual damages, acknowledging pecuniary loss that couldn't be precisely quantified. Citing Article 2224 of the Civil Code.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Insufficient Evidence of Damages:** The deletion of actual and moral damages highlights the risk of failing to provide adequate documentation or testimony to support claims for these types of compensation.
*   **Reliance on Eyewitness Testimony:** The case heavily relies on eyewitness identification, a potentially fallible form of evidence. The defense attempted to challenge the reliability of this identification, although unsuccessfully.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 248:** Definition and penalty for Murder.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2224:** Basis for awarding temperate damages.
*   **People vs. Pontilar, Jr., G.R. No. 104865, pp. 8-9, July 11, 1997:** Regarding credibility of witness
*   **People vs. Rubio, 257 SCRA 528, 533, June 20, 1996:** Regarding credibility of witness
*   **People vs. Abrenica (252 SCRA 54,62, January 18, 1996):** Regarding Treachery
*   **People vs. Vallado (257 SCRA 515, 527, June 20, 1996):** Regarding Treachery
*    **People vs. Degoma, 209 SCRA 266, May 22, 1992.:** Regarding damages.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "psychological predisposition" argument, while novel, was ultimately unsuccessful in discrediting the eyewitness testimony.  The court found no evidence of improper motive or bias.
*   The lack of clarity and substantiation for the awarded damages prompted a partial reversal on appeal, illustrating the importance of precise and documented evidence.
