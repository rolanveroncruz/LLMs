## Legal Document Summary: *Serana v. Sandiganbayan* G.R. No. 162059

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan denying petitioner's Motion to Quash Information for Estafa.

**Key Issue:** Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over the crime of Estafa allegedly committed by the petitioner, a student regent of the University of the Philippines (UP).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *denied* the Petition.  The Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Information:** Hannah Eunice D. Serana, UP Student Regent, and her brother Jade Ian D. Serana, are accused of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Information alleges that Serana misrepresented to then-President Estrada the need for funds (P15,000,000.00) for the renovation of Vinzons Hall, received a Land Bank check from the Office of the President, which her brother cashed, and misappropriated the funds.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments Against Sandiganbayan Jurisdiction:**
    *   Sandiganbayan lacks jurisdiction over Estafa, as it is not enumerated in R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft Law). Focuses on crimes by public officers in Title VII, Book II, RPC, rather than crimes against property in Title X, Book II, RPC.
    *   Petitioner is not a public officer under Salary Grade 27, as required by R.A. 8249. As student regent, she was merely representing her peers.
    *   The offense was not committed "in relation to her office," as it was not part of her functions to receive funds, citing *Soller v. Sandiganbayan*.
    *   The funds originated from President Estrada personally, not from government coffers.
*   **SC's Rationale for Upholding Sandiganbayan Jurisdiction:**
    *   **Governing Law:** The Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction is defined by P.D. 1606, as amended by R.A. 8249, not solely by R.A. 3019.
    *   **Jurisdiction over Estafa:** Section 4(b) of P.D. 1606 grants the Sandiganbayan jurisdiction over felonies (including Estafa) committed by public officials "in relation to their office." Cites *Perlas v. People* and *Bondoc v. Sandiganbayan* affirming Sandiganbayan jurisdiction over Estafa.
    *   **Public Officer Status:** Serana is a public officer because she exercises sovereign functions of the government as a member of the Board of Regents (BOR), responsible for administering UP, as per *Khan v. Office of the Ombudsman* and *Laurel v. Desierto*. Compensation is not an essential element. Explicitly falls under Section 4(A)(1)(g) of P.D. 1606 due to her BOR membership.
    *   **"In Relation to Office":** The Information explicitly alleges the offense was committed in relation to her office and taking advantage of her position. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the Information, citing *Lacson v. Executive Secretary*.
    *   **Source of Funds:** The source of the funds is a matter of defense to be proven during trial. The Information alleges the funds came from the Office of the President.
    *   **Counsel Misrepresentation:** SC admonished petitioner's counsel for misrepresenting Section 4 of P.D. 1606 as Section 4 of R.A. 3019, violating Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"In Relation to Office" Interpretation:**  The interpretation of "in relation to office" remains a key element.  The SC defers to the Information's allegations, but the actual evidence at trial will be crucial.
*   **Source of Funds Proof:**  The success of the prosecution hinges on proving that the P15,000,000 originated from government funds, not President Estrada's private funds.
*   **Abuse of Authority as a Defense:**  Serana might argue that she acted outside of her official authority and was not authorized to receive funds by the Board, although the court implies she needs to provide that during trial.
*  **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Since the crime did not happen today, an additional challenge could be based on how the court has applied the law since the crime was committed, though this has never worked in the past when challenging the Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 315, paragraph 2(a) (Estafa):** The crime charged.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):**  Petitioner erroneously claims it governs Sandiganbayan jurisdiction.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1606, as amended by R.A. 8249:** Defines jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.  Section 4(b) is key to establishing jurisdiction over Estafa committed by public officials.  Section 4(A)(1)(g) is key to holding student regent is a public official
*   **Soller v. Sandiganbayan:** Cited by petitioner but distinguished by the SC.
*   **Perlas v. People & Bondoc v. Sandiganbayan:**  Cited by the SC to support Sandiganbayan jurisdiction over Estafa.
*   **Khan v. Office of the Ombudsman & Laurel v. Desierto:** Cited by the SC for defining public office.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Serana:**  Must defend herself against the charge of Estafa in the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman:**  Obligated to prosecute the case.
*   **Sandiganbayan:** Required to provide a fair trial within its jurisdiction.
