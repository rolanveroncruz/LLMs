## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Yap vs. International Exchange Bank* (G.R. No. 175145)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on *certiorari* challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the Yaps' *certiorari* petition, which questioned the RTC's order dissolving a previously issued writ of preliminary injunction. The core issue is whether the RTC could dissolve the injunction despite prior appellate rulings upholding its issuance.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Underlying Action:** Collection suit by iBank against Looyuko and Go (Civil Case No. 98-791). Execution led to a Sheriff's sale of properties allegedly owned by Go.
*   **Injunction (Civil Case No. 67945):** The Yaps sought to enjoin the Sheriff's sale, claiming ownership of the properties via Deeds of Absolute Sale from Go. Initial application for writ of preliminary injunction denied.
*   **Annulment Suit (Civil Case No. 68088):** Yaps filed this case for Annulment of Sheriff's Auction Sale. Amended complaint includes Prayer for TRO/WPI. RTC initially granted a WPI against iBank, preventing consolidation of title and possession. This was affirmed by the CA and the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 175145).
*   **Dissolution of Injunction:** Despite prior appellate affirmation, the RTC, upon iBank's motion and offer to post a counter-bond, dissolved the injunction. This decision is the subject of the instant petition.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Yaps:**  Obligation to defend their claim of ownership to the properties based on the Deeds of Absolute Sale. Subject to potential liability for damages on their original injunction bond if they ultimately lose on the merits.
*   **iBank:** Obligation to pay the judgment in the collection suit. Obligation to post counter-bond ordered by RTC to compensate Yaps for damages if the Yaps prevail in the main annulment suit.
* **Jimmy Go**: Obligation to pay the judgement amount to iBank

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Yaps:**  Risk of losing the properties if iBank consolidates title and takes possession before the annulment suit is resolved. Risk of liability on their initial injunction bond if the annulment suit fails. Potential risk the iBank will be able to post the counter-bond ordered by the lower court
*   **iBank:** Risk of the properties being tied up in litigation for an extended period if the Yaps prevail in the annulment suit. Liable for damages to the Yaps if iBank posts the counter-bond and loses the underlying annulment case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Deeds of Absolute Sale:** The RTC raised doubts about the notarization of the Deeds of Absolute Sale, impacting the Yaps' claimed "clear legal right" necessary for injunctive relief. This remains a key contentious issue to be resolved on the merits.
*   **"Irreparable Damage":** Conflicting arguments on whether the dissolution of the injunction causes irreparable damage to the Yaps. The RTC found iBank would suffer irreparable damage if the injunction continued. The court ultimately finds that although it previously ruled the Yaps would suffer irreparable damage, that does not mean the injunction cannot be dissolved.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's dismissal and the RTC's order dissolving the injunction, contingent on iBank posting the P10,000,000 counter-bond. The Court emphasized that dissolution is distinct from issuance and can occur under Rule 58 Section 6 if the balance of equities and damages warrants. The key risk lies in the validity of the Deeds of Absolute Sale and whether Yaps can successfully defend their ownership claim in the underlying annulment suit.
