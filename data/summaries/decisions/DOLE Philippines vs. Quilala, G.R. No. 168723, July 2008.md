## Summary of *Dole Philippines, Inc. v. Quilala* (G.R. No. 168723)

This case concerns the validity of service of summons on a domestic corporation, Dole Philippines, Inc. (Dole), and whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati acquired jurisdiction over Dole.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 11, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Dictates that service of summons on a domestic private juridical entity must be made on the president, managing partner, general manager, corporate secretary, treasurer, or in-house counsel.
*   **Section 20, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Voluntary appearance of the defendant in the action is equivalent to service of summons.

**Facts:**

All Season Farm Corporation ("All Season") filed a complaint against Dole for sum of money, accounting, and damages. Alias summons was served on Dole through Marifa Dela Cruz, a legal assistant employed by Dole Pacific General Services, Ltd. Dole filed a Motion to Dismiss based on improper service, lack of cause of action, All Season not being the real party in interest, and improper suing of Dole's officers in their personal capacity. The RTC denied the motion. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed, holding that Dole's president knew of the service, and documents addressed to corporate officers are often received by their staff.

**Issue:**

Whether the CA erred in allowing substituted service on Dole, given that the summons was not served on any of the officers explicitly mentioned in Section 11, Rule 14.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision. While the initial service of summons was deemed *invalid* because Marifa Dela Cruz was neither an employee of Dole Philippines nor one of the enumerated officers in Section 11, Rule 14, Dole *voluntarily submitted* to the jurisdiction of the RTC.

**Reasoning:**

The SC applied the principle of *expressio unios est exclusio alterius* with respect to Section 11, Rule 14, emphasizing the restrictive nature of the list of officers who can receive summons. However, Dole filed an "Entry of Appearance with Motion for Time" (Records, pp. 40-41) which acknowledged receipt of the alias summons and requested an extension to file a responsive pleading. The SC cited *Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited v. Catalan* (G.R. Nos. 159590-91, October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 498, 515-516) to support the principle that seeking affirmative relief from the court constitutes voluntary submission to its jurisdiction. This action waived the defect in the original service.

**Obligations:**

Dole is obligated to participate in the case before the RTC, as the court has jurisdiction over its person.

**Liabilities:**

Dole is potentially liable for the claims alleged by All Season Farm, subject to the outcome of the RTC proceedings.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Waiver:** The primary risk is the waiver of a jurisdictional defense (improper service) through a procedural misstep (filing a motion seeking affirmative relief). This highlights the importance of strictly adhering to procedural rules and the cautious approach to filing any motions before questioning jurisdiction.
*   **Outcome of the underlying case:** The success or failure of All Season's claims.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 11, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** (Service upon domestic private juridical entity)
*   **Section 20, Rule 14 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** (Voluntary appearance)
*   *Mason v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 144662, October 13, 2003, 413 SCRA 303, 311 (Application of expressio unios est exclusio alterius to statutory construction)
*   *Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited v. Catalan*, G.R. Nos. 159590-91, October 18, 2004, 440 SCRA 498, 515-516 (Voluntary appearance by seeking affirmative relief)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity arises from the tension between the strict requirement for service on specific corporate officers and the principle of voluntary submission to jurisdiction. The issue is whether the "Entry of Appearance with Motion for Time" constituted a true voluntary submission, given that it might have been filed to avoid a default judgment without fully realizing the jurisdictional implications. This could be a point of contention, depending on the specific wording of the motion and any arguments regarding intent and knowledge.
