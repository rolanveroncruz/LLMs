## Legal Document Summary: People v. Garcia, G.R. Nos. 120387-88 (1998)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Appeal from RTC conviction for two counts of rape)

**Core Holding:** Affirms the RTC's conviction of Eduardo Garcia for two counts of rape against his daughter, Joylyn Garcia. Denies Appellant's motion for new trial based on complainant's affidavit of desistance.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rape as defined under Philippine Law:** Implicitly affirmed; carnal knowledge through force, violence, threat, and intimidation.
*   **Duty of the prosecution:** To prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, focusing on the victim's credibility and consistency of testimony.
*   **Accused's right to constitutional presumption of innocence:** Addressed, but prosecution's evidence (credible testimony of the victim) successfully overcame this presumption.
*   **Obligation to indemnify the victim:** The accused is required to pay P100,000 to the victim, Joylyn Garcia.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Eduardo Garcia found guilty of two counts of rape, sentenced to two terms of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to indemnify the victim (Joylyn Garcia) in the amount of P100,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** (Recantation by victim) Presents a risk if the Court were to find it credible and grant a new trial. However, the Court explicitly rejects it, citing established jurisprudence.
*   **Alleged Defective Information:** (Lack of parental signature on initial complaint) Potential risk if the Court were to find the victim legally incapacitated at the time of filing. Court rejects, citing Sec. 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court that complainant has the right to initiate prosecution even without the assistance of parents, grandparents or guardians unless the latter is incompetent.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Section 5:** Right of offended party to initiate prosecution.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 121, Section 2:** Grounds for a new trial.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People vs. Junio, 237 SCRA 826, 834, October 28, 1994:** Affirms the unreliability of affidavits of desistance.
*   **People vs. Ramirez, 266 SCRA 335, 348, January 20, 1997:** Emphasizes the importance of the victim's credible testimony in rape cases.
*   **People vs. Dabon, 216 SCRA 656, December 16, 1992:** Rape can be committed anywhere not only secluded places.
*   **People vs. Castromero, G.R. No. 118992, October 9, 1997:** Hymenal laceration is not an element of rape.
*   **Alonte vs. Savellano Jr, G.R. No. 131652 and Concepcion vs. Savellano Jr., G.R.No. 131728, pp. 17-20, March 9, 1998:** The victim's affidavit of desistance did not constitute a recantation, because she did not deny the truth of her complaint but merely sought to “be allowed to withdraw” and “discontinue” the case because she wished “to start life anew and live normally again."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The affidavit of desistance itself is contentious as it directly contradicts prior sworn testimony. The Court finds it lacks credibility.
*   The defense raised circumstances (family feud, location of crime, etc.) attempting to cast doubt on the prosecution's case, but the Court dismisses these as inconsequential.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court strongly upholds the conviction, giving significant weight to the victim's testimony during trial. The affidavit of desistance is deemed unreliable and insufficient to warrant a new trial or acquittal. Defense arguments regarding defective information and alleged inconsistencies are unpersuasive. The ruling emphasizes the importance of protecting victims of sexual assault and discouraging the use of recantations obtained through questionable means.
