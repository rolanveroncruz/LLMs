## Legal Document Summary: Quezon City v. ABS-CBN

**Case:** *Quezon City v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation*, G.R. No. 166408, October 6, 2008 (588 Phil. 785)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA and RTC decisions regarding the validity of Quezon City's imposition of local franchise tax on ABS-CBN.

**Key Issue:**  Does the "in lieu of all taxes" provision in ABS-CBN's legislative franchise (R.A. No. 7966, Sec. 8) exempt it from paying the local franchise tax imposed by Quezon City under its Revenue Code (QC Ordinance No. SP-91, S-93), specifically Section 31?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, holding that ABS-CBN is *not* exempt from the local franchise tax.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Quezon City Revenue Code:** Section 31 imposes a franchise tax on businesses operating in Quezon City, notwithstanding tax exemptions in special laws.
*   **R.A. No. 7966 (ABS-CBN Franchise):**
    *   Section 8 states ABS-CBN shall pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property as other corporations.
    *   It also stipulates ABS-CBN shall pay a 3% franchise tax, which "shall be in lieu of all taxes on this franchise or earnings thereof."
    *   The section also specifically includes the requirement for income taxes under the NIRC.
*   **Quezon City's Arguments:**
    *   The "in lieu of all taxes" provision cannot override the constitutional mandate for LGU self-sufficiency.
    *   Local taxes are distinct from national taxes.
    *   The Local Government Code (LGC) Section 193 withdrew tax exemptions unless otherwise provided in the LGC.
*   **ABS-CBN's Argument:** The "in lieu of all taxes" provision in its franchise should be interpreted to mean it is exempt from paying the local franchise tax because congress did not specifically list local franchise tax in the requirements.

**Court's Reasoning:**

1.  **Strict Construction Against Exemption:** Tax exemptions are construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.  The burden of proof rests on the party claiming exemption.  *Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos*, G.R. No. 120082, September 11, 1996, 261 SCRA 667.
2.  **Ambiguity of "In Lieu Of" Clause:** The "in lieu of all taxes" provision is ambiguous as it doesn't specify which taxes are covered (local or national). Because of this ambiguity it is not clear to see that taxes should be dropped and ABS-CBN fails to provide a clearer statement.
3.  **Legislative Intent:** Congress has the power to grant tax exemptions, even to the detriment of LGUs' taxing power (*City Government of Quezon City v. Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.*, G.R. No. 162015, March 6, 2006, 484 SCRA 169). But in this case, the intent to exempt ABS-CBN from *local* franchise tax is not explicitly stated, implying it was not intended.
4.  **Legislative Changes:** The court cited cases like *Carcar Electric & Ice Plant v. Collector of Internal Revenue* where the franchises in question specifically excluded payment from municipal and provincial taxes. 
5.  **Functus Officio:** The court went on to note that the introduction of VAT and the subsequent changes in legislation effectively made the 3% franchise tax (and therefore the "in lieu of all taxes" clause connected to it) *functus officio* (having no further force or authority).
6.  **LGC:** Court noted that under LGC congress had the right to exempt which in this case they did not act on the need to.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos*, G.R. No. 120082, September 11, 1996, 261 SCRA 667 (Strict interpretation of tax exemptions).
*   *City Government of Quezon City v. Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.*, G.R. No. 162015, March 6, 2006, 484 SCRA 169 (Congress's power to grant tax exemptions).
*   *Carcar Electric & Ice Plant v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, 53 O.G. (No. 4) 1068, *Manila Railroad v. Rafferty*, 40 Phil 224 (1919), *Philippine Railway Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue*, 91 Phil 35 (1952), and *Visayan Electric Co. v. David*, 92 Phil. 969 (1953) Court cited this as examples of when the congress specifically excluded entities from paying certain taxes.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 537 (Revised Charter of Quezon City)
*   R.A. No. 7966 (ABS-CBN Franchise)
*   Local Government Code (LGC), particularly Sections 137, 151, and 193.
*   National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)
*   Expanded Value Added Tax Law (R.A. No. 7716)
*   R.A. No. 8241
*   R.A. No. 8424
*   R.A. No. 9337

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of Franchise Language:** The case highlights the importance of precise language in franchise agreements, especially regarding tax liabilities.  Ambiguous "in lieu of" clauses are vulnerable to strict construction.
*   **Legislative Changes:** The ever-evolving tax landscape can render initially favorable franchise provisions obsolete. Franchise agreements should anticipate and address potential legislative changes affecting tax obligations.
*   **Prior written claim:** Court said that, although a single tax claim had been filed prior all the taxes in question were able to be refunded due to the inaction of the City Treasurer

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court emphasized the principle that tax exemptions must be clearly and unequivocally established. The ambiguous language of ABS-CBN's franchise, coupled with the principle of strict construction and legislative changes made ABS-CBN liable for local franchise tax.
