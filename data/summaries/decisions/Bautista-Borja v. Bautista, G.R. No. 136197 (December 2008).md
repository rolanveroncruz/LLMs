## Legal Document Summary: Bautista-Borja v. Bautista, G.R. No. 136197 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of a complaint for annulment of deeds of sale and/or partition of properties.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Natividad Bautista-Borja (Petitioner) alleges that her siblings and their children (Respondents) fraudulently induced her to possess and cultivate land purportedly to be partitioned. She discovered in 1994 that titles were cancelled via Deeds of Sale allegedly executed by her deceased parents (Pablo and Segundina Bautista) in favor of Simplicio and Francisco Bautista, two deceased siblings.
*   **Grounds for Annulment:** Petitioner claims the Deeds of Sale are either forgeries/falsifications (due to Pablo Bautista's illness and illiteracy) or fictitious (lack of consideration).
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Motion to Dismiss based on lack of cause of action, prescription, and laches.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Dismissed based on prescription. The RTC characterized the action as based on an implied trust arising from fraud (Art. 1456, Civil Code), subject to a 10-year prescriptive period (Art. 1144, Civil Code). Laches was also invoked.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC, citing *Salvatierra v. Court of Appeals*, holding that an action for reconveyance based on implied trust prescribes in 10 years.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA and RTC decisions, holding that the action is *imprescriptible*.

**Legal Reasoning (SC):**

*   **Nature of Action:**  The SC determined the action to be one for declaration of nullity of the Deeds of Sale based on allegations of forgery, falsification, and lack of consideration.
*   **Void vs. Voidable Contracts:** The SC emphasized the distinction between void (inexistent) and voidable contracts.  A void contract is imprescriptible (Art. 1410, Civil Code), relying on *Fil-Estate Golf and Development, Inc. v. Navarro*. The SC did note that IF the trial court finds the deeds voidable, then the action would have been prescribed.
*   **Prescription & Motion to Dismiss:** The SC, citing *Pineda v. Heirs of Eliseo Guevara*, reiterated that prescription can only be a basis for dismissal if the complaint *on its face* demonstrates that the action has prescribed. Otherwise, it requires a trial on the merits.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Trial Court:** Obligated to reinstate the complaint and conduct proceedings to determine the validity of the Deeds of Sale.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The core dispute revolves around the validity of the Deeds of Sale. If the RTC finds the deeds were valid or merely voidable, the action will be subject to prescriptive periods, potentially barring the claim.
*   **Evidentiary Burden:** The Petitioner bears the burden of proving the forgery/falsification or lack of consideration concerning the Deeds of Sale.
*   **Trust Theories:** While the SC focuses on the void/voidable contract argument, the Respondents may still attempt to argue implied or constructive trust at trial, raising prescription defenses again if the Deeds are not declared void. Petitioner contended a "resulting trust" existed. However, the court did not rule on this specifically.
*   **Respondents' Affidavits:** The introduction of affidavits from Iluminada and Aurea, alleging their parents' illiteracy and denying the sale, may strengthen the Petitioner's case but their veracity and impact on the overall evidence will be determined by the RTC.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Art. 1456, Civil Code:** Implied Trust arising from fraud/mistake.
*   **Art. 1144, Civil Code:** 10-year prescriptive period for obligations created by law.
*   **Art. 1390, Civil Code:** Voidable Contracts (lack of capacity, vitiated consent).
*   **Art. 1391, Civil Code:** 4-year prescriptive period for annulment of voidable contracts.
*   **Art. 1410, Civil Code:** Action/defense for declaration of inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.
*   ***Salvatierra v. Court of Appeals*:** Action for reconveyance based on implied trust prescribes in 10 years.
*   ***Fil-Estate Golf and Development, Inc. v. Navarro*:** Action for reconveyance based on a void contract does not prescribe.
*   ***Pineda v. Heirs of Eliseo Guevara*:** Prescription can only be determined on a motion to dismiss if the complaint shows on its face that the action has prescribed.

**Next Steps:**

The case is remanded to the RTC for trial.  The RTC must determine the validity of the Deeds of Sale based on the evidence presented. The key issue is whether the deeds are void (forged, lacking consent or consideration) or merely voidable.
