Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided *Spouses Dante and Ma. Teresa L. Galura v. Math-Agro Corporation* case, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: Spouses Dante and Ma. Teresa L. Galura v. Math-Agro Corporation, G.R. No. 167230, August 14, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Galura purchased broiler starters and finishers from Math-Agro Corporation (MAC) for P426,000, paying P72,500 and failing to pay the remaining balance of P353,500.
*   MAC, through counsel, demanded payment.
*   MAC filed a collection suit (Civil Case No. 473-M-2000) against the Spouses Galura in the RTC of Bulacan.
*   Summons was served via substituted service on Victoria Lapuz, Teresa Galura's sister-in-law, at Tierra Pura Subdivision, Tandang Sora, Quezon City. Service at other addresses was unsuccessful.
*   Spouses Galura failed to file an answer and were declared in default.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of MAC, ordering payment of the unpaid balance, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. A Writ of Execution was later issued.
*   Spouses Galura filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment with the Court of Appeals, alleging lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons and extrinsic fraud.
*   The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, finding valid substituted service and no credible evidence of extrinsic fraud.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Substituted Service of Summons (Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7, Rules of Court):**  The core issue is whether the substituted service of summons on Victoria Lapuz was valid.  The Supreme Court (SC) found it invalid because the return of service did not adequately demonstrate the impossibility of personal service within a reasonable time, and failed to establish that Ms. Lapuz was a person of suitable age and discretion residing at the defendant's residence.
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:** Because of the defective service, the SC held that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of the Spouses Galura. As established in *Keister v. Judge Navarro, 167 Phil. 567, 572-573 (1977)*, service of summons is the means by which the court acquires jurisdiction over a defendant and its lack thereof renders subsequent trial and judgment null and void.
*   **Availability of Other Remedies (Rule 47, Section 1, Rules of Court):**  The Court of Appeals faulted the Spouses Galura for not pursuing remedies like a motion for new trial or appeal. However, the SC emphasized that when a Petition for Annulment of Judgment is based on *lack of jurisdiction*, it is *not* necessary to exhaust other remedies. As stated in *Ancheta v. Ancheta, 468 Phil. 900, 911 (2004)*, a court decision rendered without jurisdiction is null and void and can be assailed at any time, unless barred by laches.
*   **Extrinsic Fraud:**  The Spouses Galura alleged that MAC fraudulently led them to believe a suit would not be filed. The SC did not substantively address this issue due to the finding of lack of jurisdiction.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision. It ruled that the RTC's decision and order of execution were null and void due to lack of jurisdiction over the persons of the Spouses Galura, resulting from the invalid substituted service of summons.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial legal action may be refiled, as the substantive issue of the debt remains unresolved. MAC may choose to re-litigate if it can properly serve summons.
*   The case hinges heavily on the specific language and sufficiency of the process server's return.
*   The extrinsic fraud claim, while not decided, may be resurrected in subsequent proceedings if the case is refiled and jurisdiction is properly obtained.
