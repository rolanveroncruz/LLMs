## Legal Document Summary - Lakeview Golf and Country Club, Inc. vs. Luzvimin Samahang Nayon, et al.

**Case:** G.R. No. 171253, April 16, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the DARAB's decision that it lacked jurisdiction and upheld the validity of a collective CLOA.

**Key Issue:** Whether the DARAB has jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue of CARP coverage after a CLOA has been registered, considering prior rulings on the land's CARP eligibility.

**Summary of Facts:**

*   Lakeview (Petitioner) owns a 60-hectare property covered by TCT No. T-11026.
*   DAR issued a Notice of Coverage under CARP to acquire and distribute the land to Luzvimin Samahang Nayon, et al. (Respondents).
*   Lakeview protested, arguing the land was not agricultural (projected golf course, mountainous, minimal topsoil) and Respondents were intruders violating Section 73 of CARP.
*   DAR Secretary denied the protest, affirmed by the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.
*   DAR issued a collective CLOA No. 00141945 in favor of Respondents, registered as TCT No. CLOA-1629.
*   Lakeview filed a petition with the PARAD to cancel the CLOA, alleging the land was mountainous with a 22.78% slope.
*   PARAD initially ruled in favor of Lakeview, declaring the CARP coverage erroneous.
*   DARAB reversed, holding it lacked jurisdiction to rule on CARP coverage and upheld the CLOA's validity.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed the DARAB ruling.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** DARAB has jurisdiction over cancellation of *registered* CLOAs under the DARAB 2003 Rules of Procedure (Section 1, Rule II), and the land is not suitable for agriculture, rendering CARP coverage erroneous.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** DAR had primary jurisdiction at the time of the initial coverage determination. The CARP coverage issue had been decided previously, and the earlier ruling is *res judicata.*
*   **Court's Holding:** DARAB lacked jurisdiction in this case, essentially agreeing with the Court of Appeals. While the DARAB generally has jurisdiction over the cancellation of registered CLOAs, this action was a disguised challenge to CARP coverage which is the exclusive domain of the DAR Secretary. The prior rulings from the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court affirmed that the property falls under CARP.

**Statutory and Regulatory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988):** Sections 50 - Vests in the DAR primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters.
*   **Executive Order No. 229:** Section 17 - Quasi-Judicial Powers of the DAR.
*   **Executive Order No. 129-A:** Created DARAB.
*   **1994 DARAB Rules of Procedure:** Section 1, Rule II - Defines DARAB's exclusive original jurisdiction including cancellation of registered CLOAs.
*   **DAR Administrative Order No. 06-00:** Section 2 - Delineates cases under the DAR Secretary's exclusive jurisdiction, including land classification for CARP coverage.
*   **DARAB 2003 Rules of Procedure** Section 1, Rule II; Section 3, Rule II

**Case Law:**

*   *Morta, Sr. v. Occidental* - Requires a tenancy relationship for DARAB jurisdiction (cited by the Court of Appeals, but not pivotal to the SC's decision).
*   *Allied Domecq Phil., Inc. v. Villon*, *Ceroferr Realty Corporation v. Court of Appeals* - Jurisidction over the subject matter is conferred by law.
*   *Padunan v. Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board* - Discusses jurisdiction between DAR and DARAB depending on CLOA registration
*   *Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Dev't. Corp*, *Nicanor T. Santos Development Corporation v. Secretary, Department of Agrarian Reform*, *Sta. Rosa Realty Development Corporation v. Amante* - Jurisdiction for classification and identification of lands for CARP coverage is held with the DAR.
*   *Aninao v. Asturias Chemical Industries, Inc.* - Previous DAR decisions on coverage are controlling.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Disguised Challenge to CARP Coverage:** The attempt to cancel the CLOA was deemed an indirect challenge to the earlier CARP coverage determination by the DAR, previously upheld by appellate courts. This circumvention of the administrative process was rejected.
*   **Jurisdictional Dispute:** The interplay between the DAR and DARAB jurisdiction over CLOA cancellation is potentially contentious and depends heavily on the specific grounds for cancellation and whether these are intertwined with CARP coverage issues.
*   **Section 73 of RA 6657:** Lakeview alleged that the farmer-beneficiaries entered the property after the enactment of CARL, which is a violation under Sec. 73. The court did not touch upon this provision, this is a potential risk that was not reviewed in this case.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The court acknowledged private respondents' argument that Lakeview failed to overcome the presumption of regularity of official functions by government employees and officials.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner (Lakeview) remains bound by the prior determination that the land is subject to CARP.
*   Respondents (Luzvimin Samahang Nayon, et al.) retain their rights as CLOA holders, subject to the terms and conditions of CARP.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed that the DARAB lacked jurisdiction to rule on the cancellation of the CLOA because the core issue was the propriety of CARP coverage, a matter previously litigated and decided by the DAR and affirmed by the courts. Any future actions regarding the land's CARP coverage must be directed to the DAR Secretary. The court essentially viewed this as *res judicata* on the CARP coverage issue.
