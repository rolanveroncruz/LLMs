**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. CA-18-35-P**

**Nature:** Disciplinary case against Security Guard I Enrique E. Manabat, Jr. (Respondent) for abandonment of post and absence without prior leave (AWOL), escalated to the Supreme Court after CA investigation and OCA recommendation.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** Simple Neglect of Duty and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The SC ultimately found the respondent guilty of **Gross Neglect of Duty** and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service.
*   **Factual Basis:** Respondent requested leave for physical therapy at PGH but did not attend, and then failed to return to his post. He was also AWOL for several days thereafter. Respondent provided inconsistent explanations regarding his absence and a family emergency.
*   **SC Reasoning:** The Court found that the respondent's claim of attending physical therapy was false, establishing intent and willfulness in neglecting his duties.
    *   While Simple Neglect of Duty is defined as failure to give proper attention due to carelessness or indifference, Gross Neglect of Duty involves willful or intentional omission in a situation where there is a duty (Saunar v. Executive Secretary Ermita, G.R. No. 186502, December 13, 2017).
*   **Prior Offenses:** Respondent had a history of disciplinary infractions, including a prior finding of simple neglect of duty (Court of Appeals by: COC Marigomen v. Manabat, Jr., 676 Phil. 157 (2011)) and multiple other offenses (discourtesy, absenteeism, etc.). This record was considered as an aggravating circumstance.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service, with accessory penalties (cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from reemployment).

**Obligations:**

*   Duty of a security guard to maintain his post and inform superiors of any inability to do so.
*   Obligation to be truthful in requesting leave and providing explanations for absences.
*   Duty to adhere to the standards of conduct expected of a government employee.

**Liabilities:**

*   Disciplinary action, including dismissal, for neglect of duty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   Loss of retirement benefits and future government employment opportunities.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of Intent:** The distinction between simple and gross neglect of duty hinges on intent. The SC's finding of "gross" neglect relied on the fabricated excuse of attending physical therapy, which shifted the action from simple neglect to a willful violation.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The respondent's prior disciplinary record significantly influenced the outcome, leading to the more severe penalty of dismissal.
*   **Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service - Definition Ambiguity:** While the SC cited Catipon v. Japson, 761 Phil. 205, 221-222 (2015), in its analysis there is no concrete definition, leaving room for discretionary interpretation, however the abandonment of office and failure to report back for work without prior notice had been deemed as such,
