## Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. RTC Pasig & Santiago (G.R. Nos. 175393 & 177731)

**Nature of Document:** Consolidated Supreme Court Decision (December 18, 2009) resolving petitions challenging the execution of a final judgment in Civil Case No. 59439, *Santiago v. GSIS*, regarding reconveyance of real properties.

**Key Issue:** Whether GSIS can avoid execution of a final and executory judgment ordering reconveyance (or payment of fair market value) of certain lots excluded from a foreclosure sale, based on (1) its alleged exemption from execution under R.A. 8291, (2) prior reconveyance arguments, and (3) alleged errors in the valuation of the lots.

**Background:**

*   Zulueta spouses obtained loans from GSIS secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   GSIS foreclosed due to default, consolidating titles.
*   GSIS sold to Yorkstown, sale disapproved
*   Certain lots (78) were expressly excluded from the original mortgage on TCT No. 26105.
*   Antonio Zulueta (successor-in-interest) assigned his rights to the excluded lots to Santiago, who then sued GSIS for reconveyance.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Santiago, ordering reconveyance or payment of fair market value if reconveyance impossible. Judgment affirmed by CA and SC (G.R. No. 155206) and became final.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **GSIS Argument:**
    *   **Exemption from Execution (Sec. 39, R.A. 8291):** GSIS claimed its funds and properties are exempt from execution based on the GSIS Act. Argued *Rubia v. GSIS* (432 SCRA 529) misinterpreted the scope of this exemption and its funds are public and exempt from garnishment.
    *   **Prior Reconveyance:** Asserted that it had already reconveyed some/all of the lots to the buyers of private respondent's assignor, and that the RTC ignored this.  This was presented for the first time during execution.
    *   **Deviation from Judgment/Primary Mode of Satisfaction:** Argued RTC should have prioritized reconveyance over monetary payment.
    *   **Undue Haste and Partiality of the Trial Court:** Alleged bias in the execution proceedings.
    *   **Negligence of Counsel:** Claimed it should not be bound by its prior counsel's failures to raise reconveyance arguments earlier in the proceedings.
    *  **Prescription:** Reiterated the argument that even if valid, the claim for reconveyance has prescribed.

*   **Santiago Argument:**
    *   **Finality of Judgment:**  The original RTC decision is final and executory, precluding further challenges to the merits.  Reliance on cases like *Quelnan v. VHF Philippines* (470 SCRA 73).
    *   **Forum Shopping:** Filing multiple petitions on similar issues constitutes forum shopping.
    *   **Impossibility of Reconveyance:** GSIS itself had already sold the lots to third parties, making reconveyance impossible.
    *   **Estoppel:** GSIS is estopped from raising the prior sale/reconveyance argument at the execution stage as it was not raised as an affirmative defense during the trial.
    *   **Lack of Evidence of Reconveyance:** GSIS provided insufficient evidence (private memoranda without authentication) to support its claims of prior reconveyance.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   **Dismissed** the consolidated petitions of GSIS.
*   **Affirmed** the CA Decision and Resolution.
*   **Reiterated the doctrine of finality of judgment.** The judgment had already been upheld by the RTC, CA, and SC, and should not be disturbed.  Cited *Spouses Gomez v. Correa, et al.* and *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals* to support the doctrine of finality of judgments.
*   **Rejected GSIS's exemption claim, citing *Rubia v. GSIS*.** The Court held the exemption is not absolute and does not encompass all GSIS funds, specifically those related to business ventures.  GSIS was not an ordinary mortgagee and that the case arose from loans and security in the nature of business.
*   **Held that reconveyance was impossible due to GSIS's sale of the lots to third parties.** Confirmed the sheriff's report.
*   **Found that GSIS was estopped from raising prior reconveyance at the execution stage.** The issue should have been raised during trial as an affirmative defense.
*   **Rejected the argument that it should not be bound by the mistakes of former counsel.** Clients are generally bound by their counsel's actions. *Romago, Inc. v. Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.* was cited.
*   **Admonished GSIS for forum shopping.**

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **High Valuation:** Even though the Supreme Court upheld the judgment, GSIS could challenge the final determination of the fair market value during the subsequent hearing ordered by the CA.
*   **Allegations of Fraud or Misrepresentation:** If GSIS could present credible evidence of fraud or misrepresentation by Santiago regarding the transfer of rights or the value of the lots, it might have grounds to pursue a separate action, but this would be a difficult and uphill battle given the finality of the original judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   R.A. 8291 (GSIS Act of 1997), Sec. 39 (Exemption from Execution)
*   *Rubia v. GSIS*, 432 SCRA 529 (Interpretation of GSIS exemption)
*   *Spouses Gomez v. Correa, et al.* (Doctrine of finality of judgments)
*   *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals* (Finality of judgments)
*   *Quelnan v. VHF Philippines* (Finality of Judgments)
*   *Romago, Inc. v. Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.* (Client bound by counsel's actions)

**Conclusion:**

This decision represents a significant victory for Santiago, as it solidifies the enforceability of a long-standing judgment against GSIS.  GSIS's attempts to avoid execution through various legal maneuvers, including invoking its exemption and belatedly raising the issue of prior reconveyance, were unsuccessful.  The doctrine of finality of judgment, estoppel, and client-counsel relationship principles heavily influenced the outcome. GSIS's best remaining course of action is to focus on the determination of the fair market value to minimize its financial liability.
