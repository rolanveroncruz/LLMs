**Case Summary: People v. Llamado, G.R. No. 185278 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs. The RTC convicted Llamado, and the CA affirmed the conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165:** Prohibits the unauthorized sale, trading, administration, etc., of dangerous drugs. Penalties range from life imprisonment to death and a fine of P500,000 to P10,000,000.
*   **Elements of Illegal Sale:** Identity of buyer and seller, object (dangerous drug), consideration (money), delivery of the drug, and payment.  (Citing *People v. Ong*, G.R. No. 175940, February 6, 2008).
*   **Definition of "Selling":**  Any act of giving away dangerous drugs for money or any other consideration (Section 3(ii), Article I of R.A. 9165).

**Facts:**

*   A buy-bust operation was conducted based on informant information about Llamado selling *shabu*.
*   PO2 Brubio acted as poseur-buyer and purchased 0.02 grams of *shabu* from Llamado for P200.
*   Llamado was arrested, and the *shabu* was sent to the PNP Crime Laboratory, which confirmed it was methylamphetamine hydrochloride.

**Appellant's Arguments:**

*   Evidence was a product of an illegal search and thus inadmissible (no warrant).
*   Police officers failed to comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (failure to make an inventory and take photographs of the seized drugs).

**Court's Holding:**

*   **Affirmed the conviction.** The prosecution proved all elements of illegal sale beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Warrantless Arrest Justified:** Llamado was caught *in flagrante delicto* during a legitimate buy-bust operation, justifying the warrantless arrest.
*   **Section 21 Non-Compliance Not Fatal:** Failure to strictly comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is not necessarily fatal if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. The Court found that the integrity was preserved.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court gave credence to the prosecution's witnesses (police officers) who are presumed to have performed their duties regularly (citing *Dimacuha v. People*, G.R. No. 143705, February 23, 2007). Appellant's denial was self-serving and uncorroborated.  Also cited *People v. Torres, G.R. No. 170837, September 12, 2006*
*   **Corpus Delicti Established:**  The *shabu* was marked, identified, and presented in court. Also cited *People v. Nicolas, G.R. No. 170234, February 8, 2007*.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Llamado is liable for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 and must serve a life imprisonment sentence and pay a fine of P500,000.
*   The seized *shabu* is confiscated in favor of the government and turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for disposal.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 21 Compliance:** While the Court found that substantial compliance was sufficient in this case, strict adherence to Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (chain of custody, inventory, photographs) is crucial to avoid challenges to the admissibility of evidence. The lack of photographic evidence and inventory could be raised on appeal.
*   **Informant Reliability:** The Court relies on the informant's information to justify the buy-bust operation. The defense could potentially challenge the informant's credibility or reliability, though that doesn't appear to be part of the appeal.
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** While the Court characterized this as an entrapment operation (which is permissible), the line between entrapment and instigation (which is not permissible) can be blurry. If the defense can argue the police unduly induced Llamado to commit the crime, it could potentially challenge the conviction.
