**Case Summary: *Mossesgeld v. Court of Appeals and Civil Registrar General*** (G.R. No. 111455, December 23, 1998)

**Facts:** Marissa Mossesgeld sought to compel the Mandaluyong Civil Registrar to register her illegitimate child's birth certificate with the surname of the alleged father, Eleazar Calasan, who had signed the birth certificate as informant, executed an affidavit of paternity, and expressed consent. The Civil Registrar refused, citing Civil Registrar General Circular No. 4 (October 11, 1988), implementing Article 176 of the Family Code, which mandates that illegitimate children use their mother's surname.

**Issue:** Whether mandamus lies to compel the Local Civil Registrar to register the birth certificate of an illegitimate child using the alleged father's surname, even with the father's acknowledgment of paternity.

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions.

**Key Provisions and Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Article 176 of the Family Code:** Illegitimate children *shall* use the surname of the mother and be under her parental authority. This is a mandatory provision, regardless of the father's acknowledgment or consent.
*   **Repeal of Article 366, Civil Code:** The Family Code effectively repealed Article 366 of the Civil Code, which gave acknowledged natural children the right to use their father's surname. The Family Code limits classifications of children to legitimate and illegitimate, eliminating "acknowledged natural" and "natural children by legal fiction" categories.
*   **Mandamus:** Mandamus is not proper to compel the performance of an act prohibited by law.
*   **Adoption:** The Court notes that the father could potentially adopt the child, which would legitimize the child and entitle the child to use his surname, per Articles 185 and 189(1) of the Family Code.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Future Challenges:** While the decision is clear on the surname issue, future challenges might arise if the father pursues adoption.
*   **Paternity Dispute (Hypothetical):** The decision assumes Calasan's paternity. While he acknowledged it, a future dispute over paternity could potentially complicate matters.
*   **Reliance on Circular No. 4:**  The decision upholds the validity of Civil Registrar General Circular No. 4, as it reflects the intent and wording of Article 176 of the Family Code.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 176:**  Illegitimate children's surname.
*   **Family Code, Article 185 & 189(1):** Adoption provisions.
*   **Civil Code, Article 366:** (Repealed by implication) Acknowledged natural children's surname.
*   **Atienza v. Brillantes, 243 SCRA 32:**  Cited to establish the effectivity date of the Family Code (August 3, 1998 - this is potentially incorrect as the Family Code took effect August 3, 1988).

**Legal Analysis for Attorney:**

This case reinforces the strict application of Article 176 of the Family Code regarding illegitimate children's surnames. It provides a strong precedent against attempts to register illegitimate children with their father's surname without a formal adoption. The decision hinges on the mandatory language of the statute and its intent to simplify and clarify filiation laws. As such, litigating a similar claim absent an adoption would be difficult. The main risk lies in the potential for adoption proceedings and any subsequent challenges regarding the validity of the adoption. The incorrect date given for when the Family Code took effect may indicate a degree of carelessness when issuing the decision, or an erratum was later issued. Further investigation is required to verify if this decision remains good law, or has been overturned or modified by subsequent jurisprudence.
