**Case Summary: Atty. Melvin D.C. Mane vs. Judge Medel Arnaldo B. Belen (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2119)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Belen for conduct unbecoming a judge (violation of Canon 3, Rule 3.04 of the Code of Judicial Conduct) stemming from his behavior towards Atty. Mane during a hearing.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Complaint:** Atty. Mane alleges Judge Belen demeaned, humiliated, and berated him during a hearing (Civil Case No. 3514-2003-C). Key evidence includes a transcript of stenographic notes.
*   **Specific Incident:** The transcript shows Judge Belen questioning Atty. Mane's legal education (MLQU vs. UP), making statements implying inferiority, engaging in unnecessary "lecturing" and "debating," and threatening to haul Atty. Mane to the IBP.  Judge Belen showed his statement of assets and liabilites to Atty. Mane.
*   **Judge's Defense:** Judge Belen justified his actions by citing an "Urgent Motion to Inhibit" filed by Atty. Mane which contained malicious imputations against the judge's integrity and by what the Judge perceived as "editing" the transcript of records. This perceived assault on his honor prompted the statements.
*   **Withdrawal of Complaint:** Atty. Mane attempted to withdraw the complaint. The Court ruled that the withdrawal does not divest the Court of its disciplinary authority.
*   **OCA Report:** The OCA found Judge Belen's statements insulting, unwarranted, and a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The OCA recommended reprimand.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Obligation:** To be patient, attentive, and courteous to lawyers (especially inexperienced ones), litigants, witnesses, and others appearing before the court (Canon 3, Rule 3.04, Code of Judicial Conduct). To avoid the appearance of impropriety and must be beyond reproach.
*   **Judge's Liability:** Judge Belen was found guilty of conduct unbecoming a judge (light charge under Section 10, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Demeaning" Conduct:** The interpretation of what constitutes demeaning or humiliating conduct can be subjective.
*   **Impact of Withdrawn Complaint:** While the court correctly asserted its disciplinary authority, the withdrawal might influence the perceived severity of the offense.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3, Rule 3.04:** Establishes the standard of conduct for judges.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 140, Sections 10 and 11(c):** Classifies conduct unbecoming a judge as a light offense and provides corresponding penalties (reprimand, censure, fine, admonition).
*   **Argumentum ad hominem:** Court cited that the Judge determine the fitness of the lawyer by Alma matter.
*   **PNB vs. Court of Appeals:** The Court also cited the decision.

**Outcome:**

*   **Reprimand:** Judge Belen was reprimanded.
*   **Warning:** He was warned that a repetition of similar acts would be dealt with more severely.
