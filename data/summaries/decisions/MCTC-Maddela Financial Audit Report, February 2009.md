## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-09-2598 (Formerly A.M. No. 08-3-65-MCTC)

**Subject:** Administrative Case against Francisca B. Dueñas, Clerk of Court II, MCTC-Maddela, Quirino, for financial irregularities, AWOL, gross dishonesty, and grave misconduct.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **AWOL & Dropping from Rolls:** Dueñas was dropped from the rolls effective April 19, 2006, due to AWOL (Absence Without Official Leave) per Sec. 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, as amended.
*   **Financial Audit Findings:** A financial audit covering January 1, 1997, to January 31, 2007, revealed significant shortages and irregularities in various court funds under Dueñas's responsibility (period until April 18, 2006).
*   **Fund Specific Irregularities:**
    *   **Judiciary Development Fund (JDF):** Shortage of P4,208.50 and delayed remittances.
    *   **General Fund:** Over-remittance of P112.00 (accruing to the National Government).
    *   **Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund (SAJF):** Shortage of P14,202.80 and delayed remittances, as well as Non-submission of Monthly Reports.
    *   **Fiduciary Fund:** Initial shortage of P414,164.82, potentially reducible to P149,664.82 upon submission of missing documentation. This involves missing official receipts, withdrawn cash bonds without supporting court orders or acknowledgment receipts, undeposited collections (P100,200.00) with no proof of refund to parties, and delayed reporting of collected cash bonds. Bank statements revealed withdrawals of P252,500.00 from the Fiduciary Fund account within a short period.
*   **Liability:** Dueñas is found liable for the shortages and irregularities in her management of court funds.
*   **Penalty:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of all leave credits and retirement benefits, and disqualification from re-employment in any government agency, including government-owned and controlled corporations.
*   **Restitution:** Dueñas is ordered to restitute P203,797.17 (balance of shortages after applying the value of her leave credits of P228,778.95 as partial restitution) within 30 days of notice.
*   **Directives:**
    *   The money value of Dueñas's earned leave credits is to be applied to the shortage in the Fiduciary Fund.
    *   The Presiding Judge is directed to locate and serve Dueñas with the restitution order and monitor the OIC (Officer-in-Charge) in handling funds.
    *   The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is directed to arrest and detain Dueñas until she complies with the restitution order.
    *   OCA is ordered to coordinate with the prosecution arm of the government to ensure the expeditious prosecution of the criminal liability of Mrs. Dueñas.

**Obligations:**

*   **Dueñas:** Restitution of P203,797.17.
*   **Presiding Judge:** Serve the restitution order and monitor the OIC's fund handling.
*   **NBI:** Arrest and detain Dueñas upon failure to comply with the restitution order.
*   **OCA:** Apply leave credit value, release funds to the OIC, coordinate with the prosecution.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dueñas:** Financial shortages, administrative liability for dishonesty and misconduct, potential criminal liability for malversation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fiduciary Fund Shortage Compliance:** The reduction of the Fiduciary Fund shortage hinges on Dueñas providing missing supporting documentation for withdrawals. The validity and authenticity of these documents, if presented, might be contentious.
*   **Enforcement of Restitution:** The effectiveness of the NBI's mandate to arrest and detain Dueñas depends on their ability to locate her and the practicalities of enforcement.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The document suggests potential criminal liability for Dueñas.  Malversation can be established even without direct proof of misappropriation given the shortages (citing *Navallo v. Sandiganbayan*).
*   **Missing Official Receipts:** Unaccounted for official receipts could indicate further irregularities and undocumented transactions that could increase the Fiduciary Fund shortage.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave (as amended):** Basis for dropping Dueñas from the rolls due to AWOL.
*   **Supreme Court Circulars No. 13-92 and No. 5-93:** Guidelines for proper administration of court funds (deposit requirements).
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Fortaleza, 434 Phil. 511, 522 (2002)*:  Responsibilities of Clerks of Court.
*   *Navallo v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 97214, July 18, 1994, 234 SCRA 175*: Establishing malversation through shortages.
*   Rule IV, Section 52-A of the Civil Service Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
*   *Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao Del Norte* (351 Phil. 1 (1998)): Failure of the Clerk of Court to remit the court funds collected by the Municipal Treasurer constitutes gross neglect of duty, dishonesty and grave misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

**Conclusion:**

This document outlines a serious case of financial mismanagement and misconduct by a Clerk of Court, resulting in her dismissal and potential criminal prosecution. The key risk lies in the recovery of funds and the successful enforcement of the restitution order. Further investigation of the missing official receipts and potentially fraudulent withdrawals is crucial.
