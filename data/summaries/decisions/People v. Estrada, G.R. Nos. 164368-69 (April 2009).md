Okay, here's a legal summary of *People of the Philippines v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada*, G.R. Nos. 164368-69, April 2, 2009, formatted in Markdown.

**Case Summary: *People v. Estrada* (G.R. Nos. 164368-69)**

**1. Issue:**

Whether the Sandiganbayan erred in granting Estrada's demurrer to evidence in Criminal Case No. 26565, for illegal use of alias (Violation of Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by RA 6085).

**2. Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Sandiganbayan's decision, denying the People's petition for review on certiorari. The prosecution failed to prove the elements of illegal use of alias, particularly public and habitual use, as required by *Ursua v. Court of Appeals* (256 SCRA 147 [1996]).

**3. Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Information's Scope:** The Information charged Estrada with representing himself as "Jose Velarde" in "several transactions" and signing documents with Equitable PCI Bank and/or other corporate entities. The Information's use of "or about February 4, 2000, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto," was construed restrictively by the Sandiganbayan as relating only to acts on or closely proximate to that date. The Supreme Court upheld this construction, arguing that a broader reading would violate Estrada's right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
*   **C.A. No. 142 Violation (Illegal Use of Alias):**  The prosecution had to prove the Estradaâ€™s use of an alias was both public and habitual. The Court reiterated the *Ursua* definition of "alias" requiring an intent to be known publicly and habitually by the alias *in addition to* his real name.
*   **"Public" Use:** The mere presence of Aprodicio Lacquian and Fernando Chua during the opening of the trust account, or communications with Ortaliza and Dichavez, did not constitute "public" use. The Court emphasized that Lacquian and Chua occupied confidential positions, and communications with the other individuals occurred in private, lacking the intent to be publicly known as "Jose Velarde."
*   **R.A. No. 1405 (Secrecy of Bank Deposits):** Estrada's use of the alias in opening a numbered trust account fell under the protection of R.A. No. 1405, which guarantees the absolute confidentiality of bank deposits and investments.  The Court affirmed that a trust account is considered a "deposit" under R.A. 1405, citing *Ejercito v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. Nos. 157294-95, November 30, 2006). This privacy expectation negated the element of "public" use required under C.A. No. 142.
*   **R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act):** The enactment of R.A. No. 9160, which prohibited anonymous accounts, was a significant development.  It served to codify that the prior use of numbered accounts was permitted; indicting Estrada under that law would violate the constitutional prohibition on the enactment and use of ex post facto laws.
*   **Interlocutory vs. Final Order:**  The Sandiganbayan's earlier resolution denying Estrada's motion to quash was an interlocutory order and could be revisited; thus its later finding was not barred.

**4. Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **C.A. No. 142, as amended by R.A. No. 6085 (Anti-Alias Law):** The statute under which Estrada was charged.
*   **R.A. No. 1405 (Secrecy of Bank Deposits Law):**  Crucial in establishing the expectation of privacy in the banking transaction.
*   **R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act):**  The newness of the law, to which any changes of policy were not retroactive.
*   ***Ursua v. Court of Appeals* (256 SCRA 147 [1996]):**  Definitive case law on the elements of illegal use of alias, particularly the requirements of public and habitual use. The court was guided by this case and the doctrine of *stare decisis* to guide its findings.
*   ***Ejercito v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. Nos. 157294-95, November 30, 2006):**  This established the protection of bank deposits.

**5. Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Narrow Interpretation of Information:**  The restrictive interpretation of the Information regarding the timing of the alleged offense significantly limited the evidence the prosecution could present.
*   **Application of *Ursua* to Public Official:**  The Court's refusal to distinguish between a private citizen and the President of the Republic in applying C.A. No. 142 raises questions about the accountability of public officials using aliases to conceal assets.
*   **Interplay of R.A. No. 1405 and C.A. No. 142:**  The Court's finding that R.A. No. 1405 can shield the use of an alias in banking transactions from prosecution under C.A. No. 142 could create a loophole for concealing illegal activities.

**6. Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's dismissal of the illegal use of alias charge against Estrada.  The prosecution failed to prove the element of public use, and the Court found that the transaction was protected by the Secrecy of Bank Deposits Law. The narrow interpretation of the Information and the application of existing case law were key to the Court's decision.
