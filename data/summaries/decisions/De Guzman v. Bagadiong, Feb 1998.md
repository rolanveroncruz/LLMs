## Legal Document Summary: *De Guzman v. Bagadiong*

**Case Citation:** *De Guzman v. Bagadiong*, A.M. No. P-96-1220, February 27, 1998 (350 Phil. 227; 95 OG No. 11, 1717 (March 15, 1999))

**Nature:** Administrative disciplinary case against a court stenographer for overcharging for transcript of stenographic notes.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Respondent, a Court Stenographer III, charged the complainant P21.00 per page for single-spaced transcripts (typed at home) and claimed to be charging P400.00 “pakyaw” for transcripts.
*   **Rule 141, Section 10 (as amended by Administrative Circular No. 31-90):** Sets the fee for transcription of stenographic notes at P5.00 per page (not less than 250 words) before appeal, with half payable to the court and half to the stenographer. The respondent clearly violated this provision.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Requires stenographers to transcribe notes within 20 days and submit a monthly compliance certification, with salary withholding for non-compliance.

**Obligations:**

*   Stenographers have a duty to provide transcripts at the prescribed rates (Rule 141, Section 10).
*   Stenographers must transcribe notes promptly and attach them to the case record (Administrative Circular No. 24-90; Rule 136, Section 17, par. 1, Rules of Court).
*   Public officials have a general obligation of public service, as stated in Alivia vs. Nieto.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent is found administratively liable for violating Rule 141, Section 10, and for failing to recognize the importance of transcription as a public service function.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Stenographers overcharging:** This case underscores the risk of court personnel engaging in corrupt practices, undermining public trust.
*   **Failure to comply with Circular No. 24-90:** Delay in the process of justice.
*   **Lack of Awareness of Public Service:** Highlights a broader issue of lack of understanding of public service among court employees.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 10, Rules of Court (as amended by Administrative Circular No. 31-90):** Sets transcription fees.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Mandates prompt transcription and monthly compliance certification.
*   **Rule 136, Section 17, par. 1, Rules of Court:** Sets out the general duties of the stenographer.
*   **Alivia vs. Nieto (215 SCRA 62 [1995]):** Emphasizes public accountability.
*   **Rodas vs. Aquilizan (61 SCRA 325 [1994]):** Stresses the duty to serve the public without expectation of personal favor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Respondent argued the rate of P21 was proper because the transcripts were single spaced pages typed at home and argued "equal pay for equal work". The court strongly rejected this.

**Court Decision:** The Court suspended the respondent from office for two (2) months without pay, with a stern warning against future similar offenses. The decision aimed to set an example for all court stenographers regarding the meaning of public service.
