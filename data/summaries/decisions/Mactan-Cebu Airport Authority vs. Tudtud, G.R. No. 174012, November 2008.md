## Legal Document Summary: *Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority vs. Benjamin Tudtud, et al.* G.R. No. 174012

**Nature of the Case:** Action for reconveyance and damages filed by the original landowners against the MCIAA, seeking the return of land expropriated for the expansion of the Cebu Lahug Airport, as the airport was closed and the land was no longer being used for the intended purpose.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Expropriation:** The National Airports Corporation (NAC) acquired Lot No. 988 in 1949 via a judgment of expropriation (Civil Case No. R-1881) for the expansion of Cebu Lahug Airport. Title was transferred to the Republic of the Philippines, and later to ATO, and finally to MCIAA in 1990.
*   **Abandonment of Public Purpose:** The Cebu Lahug Airport was closed. MCIAA did not build any structures on the Lot. 988 for airport use.
*   **Parole Evidence:** The original landowners claim NAC verbally assured them a right to repurchase if the land was no longer needed for airport purposes. This parol evidence, inadmissible to vary an unconditional final judgment, was allowed to be admitted in court
*   **Court's Decision:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision in favor of the original landowners, ordering MCIAA to reconvey the property. The Court also ordered the respondents to return the just compensation that was given to them from the original expropriation.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **MCIAA:** Obligated to reconvey Lot No. 988 to the original landowners. Entitled to keep fruits/income from the property. Liable for Legal interest accruing for the length of time the land owners did not have their land.
*   **Original Landowners (Respondents):** Obligated to return the original just compensation received, plus legal interest (from the time MCIAA complies with reconveyance). Obligated to pay MCIAA for necessary expenses incurred in sustaining the lot. Entitled to keep interest earned on the just compensation and the appreciation in value of the land.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Issues:** Determining the precise amounts for "necessary expenses" incurred by MCIAA, the "monetary value of services," and the "legal interest" to be paid by the respondents could lead to further disputes. The need for further calculation of repayment amounts is uncertain.
*   **Collateral Estoppel/Res Judicata Concerns:** MCIAA has had previous litigation regarding other lots from the same expropriation (Civil Case No. R-1881). The SC distinguished *MCIAA v. Court of Appeals and Chiongbian*, as the evidence offered was inadmissible as hearsay. However, future similar claims might arise and test the boundaries of collateral estoppel.
*   **Statute of Frauds:** The Statute of Frauds was not applicable because the contract was partially performed. This is ambiguous because the expropriation, the legal taking of one's land without their true consent, could not be classified as a contract that one voluntarily participates in.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6958:** Transferred ownership of the land to MCIAA.
*   **Civil Case No. R-1881:** Original expropriation case.
*   ***Fery v. Municipality of Cabanatuan*, 42 Phil. 28 (1921):** Generally stands for the proposition that expropriation grants the government a fee simple title. But the court distinguished this case.
*   ***Heirs of Timoteo Moreno v. MCIAA*, 459 Phil. 948 (2003):** Previously ruled that the dispositive portion of Civil Case No. R-1881 must be read in conjunction with the body of the decision.
*   ***MCIAA v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 121506, October 30, 1996, 263 SCRA 736:** Similar case where parol evidence of a right to repurchase was admitted. Court distinguished here.
*   **Article 1190, Civil Code:** Governs obligations to give, requiring parties to return what they received upon fulfillment of conditions.
*   **Article 1403 (2)(e) of the Civil Code:** Governs the statute of frauds.
*   **Article 1187 of the Civil Code:** Governs the effects of conditional obligations.
*   **Article 1169 of the Civil Code:** Governs delay

**Potential Arguments and Strategies for MCIAA:**

*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Focus on demonstrating that *Chiongbian* case and/or the general rule against varying final judgments with parol evidence should control. Argue lack of clear and convincing evidence of a binding promise to reconvey.
*   **Damages Mitigation:** Aggressively argue for high valuation of "necessary expenses" and "services" provided to the property to offset the landowners' gains.

**Conclusion:**

This decision significantly limits the traditional "fee simple" view of expropriation, creating a potential precedent for landowners to reclaim expropriated land when the original public purpose is abandoned, even absent explicit contractual repurchase clauses. The precise financial obligations remain unclear and require further court determination. There is great cause for MCIAA to seek Motion for Reconsideration to have the decision repealed.
