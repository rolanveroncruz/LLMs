**Case Summary: *GARCIA v. BURGOS*, 353 Phil. 740 (G.R. No. 124130, June 29, 1998)**

**Nature of the Document:**  Supreme Court decision resolving a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, assailing Orders of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cebu related to a preliminary injunction against the Cebu South Reclamation Project (CSRP).

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** Gov. Pablo P. Garcia, Province of Cebu, Tomas R. Osme√±a, City of Cebu, et al.
*   **Respondents:** Hon. Jose P. Burgos (RTC Judge) and Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation (MIIC).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Main Issue:**  Whether the RTC judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing Orders that (a) denied the motion to lift a TRO and cancel/defer the hearing on the preliminary injunction application, (b) reconsidered his voluntary inhibition, and (c) granted a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the CSRProject, in violation of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1818.

*   **P.D. 1818 Violation:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the injunction violated P.D. 1818, which prohibits courts from issuing restraining orders or injunctions against infrastructure projects of the government.  The CSRProject is deemed a government infrastructure project under *Malayan Integrated Industries Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 640* (a previous case involving the same company), and is thus covered by P.D. 1818.

*   **Presidential Approval:**  MIIC argued that the CSRProject lacked proper presidential approval under E.O. 525, but the SC found that Presidential Memoranda showed approval "in principle" by President Marcos on August 13, 1979.

*   **MIIC's Alleged Vested Rights:**  MIIC claimed a right of first refusal based on the same Presidential Memorandum, arguing that the invitation to bid violated its vested rights. The SC rejected this, stating that any such right is subject to compliance with P.D. 1594 (policies, guidelines, rules and regulations for government infrastructure contracts). Competitive public bidding is generally required, and the SC stressed the importance of public bidding in government projects, citing *National Food Authority vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 470*. The right to first refusal, if it exists, only becomes relevant if its proposal matches the highest bid of another proponent.

*Negotiated Contracts: Under Section 4 of PD 1594, a negotiated contract may be allowed in exceptional circumstances, subject to Presidential approval. This further undermines MIIC's claim that its supposed right of first refusal automatically entitles it to a contract.

*   **Voluntary Inhibition:**  The SC also found that the RTC judge erred in reconsidering his voluntary inhibition.  He had initially inhibited himself due to allegations of "prejudgment," and the SC found his reasons for reversing that decision to be insufficient.

*   **Procedural Issues:** MIIC contended that petitioners' Omnibus Motion was a mere scrap of paper due to defective notice. The SC rejected this, stating that the Omnibus Motion challenged the court's jurisdiction.

*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Contrary to MIIC's claim, a Motion for Reconsideration with Cautionary Notice was filed.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Government Entities:**  Obligated to comply with P.D. 1818 and P.D. 1594 regarding infrastructure projects. Any contract award would require a public bid except in the exceptions outlined by law, subject to Presidential approval.
*   **Courts:**  Obligated to uphold the law and legal precedents (particularly Supreme Court rulings). Cannot issue injunctions against government infrastructure projects without violating P.D. 1818.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Delays in Infrastructure Projects:**  Unjustified injunctions (like the one issued by the RTC judge) can significantly delay crucial government projects, hindering economic development.
*   **Financial Exposure:** MIIC would be liable on its injunction bond for damages caused to the petitioners as a result of the wrongly-granted injunction.
*   **Judicial Misconduct:** Judge Burgos was cautioned, in the dispositive portion, to observe the ruling of the SC.
*   **MIIC's Legal Standing:** Weakened significantly. Its claim to a right of first refusal is severely limited, and its prior contracts do not provide a basis for injunctive relief.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. 1818:**  Prohibits injunctions against government infrastructure projects.
*   **P.D. 1594:**  Sets policies and guidelines for government infrastructure contracts, including public bidding requirements.
*   **E.O. 525:**  Deals with reclamation projects requiring Presidential approval.
*   **E.O. 380:**  Relates to Presidential approval of negotiated infrastructure contracts.
*   ***Malayan Integrated Industries Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 640:***  Established that reclamation projects are infrastructure projects under P.D. 1818.
*   ***National Food Authority vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 470:***  Discusses the purpose and importance of competitive public bidding.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:**  Governs petitions for certiorari.
*   **Civil Code, Article 7:** Laws are repealed only by subsequent ones.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court:** Taking judicial notice
*   **China Banking Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 265 SCRA 327:** before a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued, there must be a clear showing by the complaint that there exists a right to be protected, and that the acts against which the writ is to be directed are violative of the said right

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*The extent and nature of MIIC's right of first refusal were ambiguous and contentious, resolved by the Court to require full compliance with all bidding and regulatory requirements before such a right could be exercised.
*Judge Burgos reconsideration for voluntary inhibition. The SC deemed this insufficient.

**Outcome:**

Petition GRANTED. The RTC Orders were REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The temporary restraining order was MADE PERMANENT. Respondent judge was ordered to INHIBIT himself from further hearing the case.
