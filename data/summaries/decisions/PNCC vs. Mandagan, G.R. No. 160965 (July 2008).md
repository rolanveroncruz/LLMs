## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine National Construction Corporation vs. Maria Nympha Mandagan* (G.R. No. 160965)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision that reversed the LA and NLRC decisions upholding the dismissal of respondent Mandagan for cause.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment:** Mandagan was a Legal Assistant (Assistant Manager) at PNCC.
*   **Dismissal:** PNCC terminated Mandagan for violations of its Code of Employee Discipline, specifically:
    *   Private practice of law (moonlighting)
    *   Using company address for private cases
    *   Representing a client with a pending case against PNCC (conflict of interest)
*   **PNCC Code of Employee Discipline:**
    *   Section 6 prohibits moonlighting without management approval.
    *   Section 8 prohibits using company property for personal use.
    *   Section 11 prohibits conflict of interest.
*   **Remedies:** The Court of Appeals ordered PNCC to pay Mandagan separation pay in lieu of reinstatement and full backwages.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PNCC:** Had the burden to prove just cause for dismissal, which the Court found it failed to do. Now obligated to pay separation pay and backwages.
*   **Mandagan:** Had a duty to adhere to PNCC's Code of Employee Discipline. However, the court found that the violation was not clearly established by clear and convincing evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Private Practice of Law":** The case hinges on whether Mandagan's actions constituted "private practice of law." The Court relies on *Office of the Court Administrator v. Atty. Misael M. Ladaga* (403 Phil. 228 (2001)) to define it as more than an isolated appearance.
*   **"Knowledge OR Approval" Clause:** The PNCC code prohibits working for another employer without the "knowledge OR approval" of management. The disjunctive phrasing is crucial; knowledge alone can suffice as implied approval.
*   **Authority for Representation:** The case involves a dispute over whether Mandagan had the necessary authority from PNCC management to represent an employee, Ramirez, in an ejectment case. Lack of documentary evidence hurts PNCC's case.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** PNCC alleges that it has lost trust and confidence in Mandagan due to the events and her frequent tardiness and absences.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (as amended):** Specifically, Art. 227(b), related to security of tenure.
*   **Philippine Constitution, Art. 13, Sec. 3:** Guarantee of security of tenure.
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Atty. Misael M. Ladaga*, 403 Phil. 228 (2001): Defines "private practice of law."
*   *Eastern Telecommunications Phils., Inc. v. Diamse, G.R. No. 169299, June 16, 2006: Importance of independent evaluation when administrative and appellate court findings differ.
*   *Etcuban, Jr. v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc., G.R. No. 148410, January 17, 2005: On dismissal of managerial employees due to loss of trust and confidence.
*   *AMA Computer College, Inc. v. Garay, G.R. No. 162468, January 23, 2007: Loss of trust and confidence must be based on willful breach and founded on clearly established facts.
*   *Philippine National Construction Corporation v. Matias, G.R. No. 156283, May 6, 2005: Loss of trust and confidence should not be used as a subterfuge for causes which are illegal, improper, and unjustified.

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   The core ambiguity lies in whether Mandagan's actions truly violated the PNCC Code. The Court leans towards a more lenient interpretation given the potential ambiguities in the code itself (the disjunctive "knowledge OR approval" clause).
*   The timing of PNCC's allegations regarding tardiness, absences, and misrepresentations in the Malaca√±ang resume suggests that these were raised merely as an afterthought to justify dismissal.
