## Legal Document Summary: *Monzon v. Relova* (G.R. No. 171827)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's decision in an injunction case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC violated Monzon's right to due process by rendering judgment after an *ex parte* presentation of evidence without giving her an opportunity to present her defense. Additionally, whether the Respondents stated a valid cause of action for receiving the residue from an extrajudicial foreclosure sale.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Teresita Monzon (Mortgagor/Debtor)
*   **Respondents:** Sps. James & Maria Rosa Nieves Relova and Sps. Bienvenido & Eufracia Perez (Mortgagees/Creditors)
*   **Intervenor:** Addio Properties, Inc. (Purchaser at Foreclosure Sale)

**Factual Background:**

Monzon executed promissory notes in favor of the Relovas and Perezes, secured by portions of a larger property. She later executed a Deed of Absolute Sale (Perez) and a Deed of Conditional Sale (Relova) over the secured portions. The entire property was subsequently extrajudicially foreclosed by Coastal Lending Corp., and Addio Properties, Inc. was the winning bidder, resulting in a residue amount held by the Clerk of Court. The Relovas and Perezes filed a Petition for Injunction seeking to have this residue applied to Monzon's debts to them, relying on Section 4, Rule 68 of the Rules of Court.

**RTC Decision:**

Ruled in favor of the Respondents, ordering the Clerk of Court to deliver the residue to them. This was based on an *ex parte* presentation of evidence due to Monzon's absence from hearings, despite filing an Answer.

**CA Decision:**

Affirmed the RTC, stating Monzon had ample opportunity to defend her interests.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

Reversed the CA and RTC decisions.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Promissory Notes:**  Monzon's obligation to pay the Relovas and Perezes, secured by real estate mortgages.
*   **Deeds of Sale:** Monzon claims these deeds constituted *dacion en pago*, extinguishing her obligations under the notes. This is a key factual dispute that needs proper adjudication.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:**  Governed by Act No. 3135, as amended, and A.M. No. 99-10-05-0, outlining procedures for extrajudicial sales.
*   **Residue Distribution (Rule 68 vs. Act 3135):**  Critical legal distinction. The SC correctly points out that Rule 68 (judicial foreclosure) does **not** apply to extrajudicial foreclosures. Act No. 3135 does not grant junior encumbrancers the right to receive the balance of the purchase price; only the right of redemption.

**Liabilities:**

*   Monzon's potential liability to the Relovas and Perezes depends on whether the promissory notes were extinguished by *dacion en pago*.
*   If the notes were not extinguished, Monzon's liability is capped by the mortgage security.
*   Potential liability to Addio Properties, Inc. if *dacion en pago* is proven and respondents are not entitled to the properties.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Due Process Violation:**  The RTC's *ex parte* proceeding without formally defaulting Monzon violated her right to present evidence and undermines the fairness of the proceedings. Cites *Philippine National Bank v. De Leon*.
*   **Misapplication of Rule 68:**  The Respondents' reliance on Rule 68 for distribution of proceeds in an extrajudicial foreclosure is a fundamental error.  Cites *Supena v. Dela Rosa*.
*   **Failure to State a Cause of Action (against Atty. Luna):**  Respondents have no legal basis under Act No. 3135 to demand the residue from the Clerk of Court. Cites *Katon v. Palanca, Jr.*
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Intent:**  The Court orders the RTC to determine if respondents intended to pursue a collection of sum of money by waiving the mortgage executed over the subject properties.
*  **Potential Double Sale:** Court highlights potential double sale of the properties.
*   **Order of Mortgage Execution:** The trial court is ordered to determine whether Respondents' mortgage contract was executed before or after the mortgage contract with Addio Properties, Inc.

**Disposition:**

The SC *REVERSED* the CA and RTC. The case was *REMANDED* to the RTC for further proceedings. The RTC was instructed to:

1.  *Dismiss* the case against Atty. Ana Liza Luna.
2.  Require the Respondents to *manifest* whether they intend the Petition for Injunction to be treated as a complaint for collection of sum of money (thereby waiving their security interest).
3.  If affirmative, allow Monzon to present her defense, including evidence of *dacion en pago*.
4.  If negative, dismiss the case (without prejudice to respondents' rights as mortgage creditors.)

**Recommendations for Legal Counsel:**

1.  **Focus on Remand:**  Prepare to present evidence of *dacion en pago* on remand to the RTC.
2.  **Argue Lack of Cause of Action (Respondents):** If representing the respondents,  argue that the court should permit for the petition to be treated as a complaint for collection of sum of money.
3.  **Evaluate Mortgage Priorities:** Determine the order of priority of the mortgages to properly advise on redemption rights (if any).
4.  **Consider Action for Damages:**  Advise respondents whether it is possible to file action for damages against Monzon.
5.  **Consider Action to Recover Possession:** Advise respondents whether it is possible to file action to recover possession if they prevail in having the mortgage.
6.  **Comply with Section 6 of Act No. 3135:** Adhere to guidelines and provisions for filing of mortgages.
