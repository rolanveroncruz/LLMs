*   Complainant alleges harassment, verbal abuse (calling him names and attempted boxing).
*   Respondent denies the allegations.
*   The case was referred to Executive Judge Absalon U. Fulache for investigation.
*   Judge Fulache found that the Respondent's actions were discourteous.
*   OCA agreed with the findings but recommended a fine instead of reprimand.
*   The Supreme Court agreed with OCA's findings.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent was fined P5,000.00.
*   Respondent was warned that a repetition of similar actions would be dealt with more severely.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Factual Claims:** The initial dispute centers on conflicting accounts of the interaction between the complainant and respondent. The burden of proof rests on the complainant to demonstrate the misconduct.
*   **Reliance on Barangay Resolution:** The Court relies heavily on the Barangay Resolution dated July 21, 2003, asserting that the respondent had agreed to refrain from certain actions. The respondent's denial of any settlement is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity in the Barangay Chairman's official duty.
*   **Discretionary Penalty:** The determination of the appropriate penalty (reprimand vs. fine) involves the Court's discretion, considering the respondent's length of service and the severity of the misconduct.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** Defines the standards of conduct expected of public officials, including court employees.
*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160):** The requirement for Barangay conciliation proceedings (Section 412)
*   **Rule 131, Section 2(m):** Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.
*   **Jugueta v. Estacio, A.M. No. CA-04-17-P, 25 November 2004, 444 SCRA 10, 16:** Denial is inherently a weak defense.
*   **Navarro v. Cerezo, A.M. No. P-05-1962, 17 February 2005, 451 SCRA 626, 629:** Mere allegation is not evidence, and is not equivalent to proof.

**Summary Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found the respondent guilty of conduct unbecoming a public officer and a member of the judiciary based on evidence presented, including the Resolution issued by the Barangay Chairman and the admission of a heated argument by Clerk of Court. The Court's decision highlights the importance of maintaining proper decorum and ethical conduct among court employees, even outside official duties. This precedent reinforces the Judiciary's expectation of professionalism and respect from its employees.
