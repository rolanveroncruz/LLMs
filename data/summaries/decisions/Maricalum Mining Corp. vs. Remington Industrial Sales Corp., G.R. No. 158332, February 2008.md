**Legal Document Summary: *Maricalum Mining Corporation v. Remington Industrial Sales Corporation*, G.R. No. 158332, February 11, 2008**

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeals' decision and annulling the Regional Trial Court's orders granting execution against Maricalum Mining Corporation.

**Key Issue:** Whether decisions in *DBP v. CA* and *PNB v. CA*, dismissing Remington's claim against DBP and PNB, inure to the benefit of Maricalum, precluding execution against it.

**Summary of Facts:**

*   Remington sued Marinduque Mining (MMIC) for unpaid materials (Civil Case No. 84-25858). Amended complaints impleaded PNB, DBP, APT, Nonoc Mining, ICC, and Maricalum as assignees/transferees of MMIC's assets.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Remington, holding all defendants jointly and severally liable.
*   Maricalum, along with PNB, DBP, and others, appealed to the CA. The CA affirmed the RTC decision.
*   Maricalum's attempt to appeal to the Supreme Court (SC) was denied due to procedural defects, rendering the CA decision final and executory *against Maricalum specifically*.
*   PNB and DBP also appealed to the SC separately. The SC ultimately *reversed* the CA decision in *DBP v. CA* and *PNB v. CA*, *dismissing* Remington's complaint as against PNB and DBP. The SC found no fraud justifying piercing the corporate veil and held that Remington's remedy was a liquidation proceeding against MMIC under Article 2243 of the Civil Code.
*   Remington sought execution against Maricalum based on the finality of the CA decision against it. The RTC granted the motion.
*   Maricalum appealed to the CA via certiorari, arguing that the *PNB v. CA* decision exonerated it, as it was merely an assignee/successor-in-interest of PNB and DBP.
*   The CA rejected Maricalum's argument, holding that the PNB/DBP appeals did not benefit Maricalum, whose appeal had already been denied.
*   Maricalum then appealed to the SC, resulting in the present decision.

**Holding:**

The SC reversed the CA, holding that the *DBP v. CA* and *PNB v. CA* decisions *did* inure to the benefit of Maricalum, barring execution. The SC reasoned that Maricalum, PNB, and DBP shared a commonality of interest, satisfying the exception to the general rule that an appeal by one party does not benefit a co-party who failed to appeal.  *Director of Lands v. Reyes* (69 SCRA 415) was cited for the criteria establishing such a commonality: rights and liabilities stemming from a single source, homogeneous evidence, and impacted rights/liabilities.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The RTC initially imposed joint and several liability on the defendants, including Maricalum.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Remington attempted to pierce the corporate veil between MMIC, DBP, and Maricalum to hold them liable for MMIC's debts.  The SC in *DBP v. CA* found no basis for this.
*   **Article 2243, Civil Code:** The SC in *DBP v. CA* identified this as Remington's proper remedy, requiring a liquidation proceeding against MMIC for the unpaid purchase price of materials.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial RTC Ruling:** Maricalum was initially liable for the unpaid debt based on the RTC's joint and several liability ruling.
*   **SC Ruling:** Ultimately, Maricalum was *not* liable to Remington based on the SC's application of *DBP v. CA* and *PNB v. CA*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Favorable Decisions (DBP v. CA and PNB v. CA):** The document highlights the risk of relying on decisions in related cases where a party isn't directly involved as a primary litigant. Maricalum successfully argued that it fell under the exception to the general rule and enjoyed the benefits of the favorable judgement by PNB and DBP.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** Maricalum's initial failure to perfect its appeal due to a procedural defect nearly cost it the case.
*   **Collateral Estoppel (Res Judicata):** The principle of res judicata, particularly collateral estoppel, is implicated. The prior SC rulings on the lack of grounds to pierce the corporate veil and the dismissal of the case against DBP and PNB were deemed binding on Remington in its action against Maricalum.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***DBP v. CA*, 415 Phil. 538 (2001):** Key decision dismissing Remington's claims against DBP.
*   ***PNB v. CA*, 419 Phil. 480 (2001):** Key decision dismissing Remington's claims against PNB.
*   ***Director of Lands v. Reyes*, 69 SCRA 415:** Establishes the criteria for commonality of interests.
*   ***John Kam Biak Y. Chan, Jr. v. Iglesia ni Cristo*, G.R. No. 160283, October 14, 2005:** Reinforces the exception to the general rule regarding appeals by co-parties.
*   **Article 2243, Civil Code:** Specifies Remington's proper remedy (liquidation proceedings).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 385 (The Law on Mandatory Foreclosure):** This law mandated PNB and DBP to foreclose on the mortgage and transfer assets.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of the "commonality of interest" exception to the rule that an appeal does not inure to the benefit of a non-appealing party was contentious. The CA disagreed with Maricalum's argument.
*   The extent to which the SC decisions in *DBP v. CA* and *PNB v. CA* had *res judicata* or collateral estoppel effect on Remington's claim against Maricalum was a central issue of disagreement between the parties and the lower courts.

**Overall Risk Assessment:**

*   Initially, Maricalum faced significant risk of execution. However, the SC decision eliminated this risk, finding no legal basis for holding Maricalum liable for MMIC's debts.
