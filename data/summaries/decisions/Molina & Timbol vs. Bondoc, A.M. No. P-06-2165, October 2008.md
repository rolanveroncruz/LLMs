## Summary of A.M. No. P-06-2165 (Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 05-2220-P)

This Supreme Court decision addresses an administrative complaint filed by Dolores Molina and Aproniano Timbol (Complainants) against Atty. Gitanjali Bondoc (Respondent), Clerk of Court V, RTC Manila, Branch 12, for Grave Misconduct and Violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (presumably RA 3019, although not explicitly cited).

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Bribery Allegation:** Complainants alleged Respondent solicited and received P200,000 for guaranteeing acquittal in their estafa case, representing she was influential with the presiding judge and would draft the decision. A further demand of P50,000 was made but not paid.
*   **Receipt as Evidence:** The primary piece of evidence was a xerox copy of a receipt purportedly signed by the Respondent using her alias "Jeta M. Bondoc," acknowledging receipt of the P200,000 "for Judge R. Carandang, Branch 12, Manila."
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent denied the allegations, questioned the authenticity of the receipt, and pointed out that Judge Carandang had been promoted to the Court of Appeals before the alleged transaction.

**Procedural History:**

*   Complaint initially filed with the Ombudsman, referred to the OCA.
*   OCA referred the case to the Executive Judge of RTC Manila for investigation.
*   Investigating Judge initially found Respondent guilty, recommending suspension, based on the receipt.
*   OCA found the investigation insufficient and recommended further investigation, including handwriting analysis.
*   NBI handwriting expert could not authenticate the xeroxed receipt. Complainants failed to produce the original receipt or any other witnesses.
*   Investigating Judge reversed his prior recommendation and recommended dismissal.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The Court **dismissed** the complaint for lack of merit.
*   The Court found the complainants' evidence unreliable and riddled with inconsistencies.
*   The xeroxed receipt was not authenticated and its origin was questionable.
*   The Court found it unbelievable that the respondent, a lawyer and Clerk of Court, would execute a receipt explicitly acknowledging a bribe for a judge.
*   The Court highlighted inconsistencies regarding the timing and intended recipients of the bribe, particularly the fact that Judge Carandang had already left the RTC at the time of the alleged payment.
*   The court acknowledged its duty to protect court personnel from baseless administrative charges.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:** The initial recommendation for suspension highlights the risk of relying on circumstantial evidence, particularly a disputed document.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** The initial investigation was deemed insufficient by the OCA, underscoring the need for thorough investigation in administrative cases, given their penal nature.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The changing narratives of the Complainants significantly undermined their credibility and demonstrates the need for meticulous fact checking.
*   **Failure to Produce Original Evidence:** The inability of the complainants to produce the original receipt was fatal to their case. The court underscored the necessity for submitting authentic and examinable evidence.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 6, Article VIII of the Constitution:** Cited as the basis for the Supreme Court's administrative supervision over all courts and court personnel.
*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Mentioned as a basis for the complaint, although not specifically analyzed in the decision. The decision makes a general statement of the penal nature of administrative cases, citing *Court Administrator v. Paredes, Adm. Matter No. R-375-MTJ, September 30, 1987, 154 SCRA 754* and *Lopez v.

*   Several cases were cited related to the Courts duty to both discipline erring employees and protect court personnel from baseless charges, including *Belgica v. Belgica, G.R. No. 149738, August 28, 2007, 531 SCRA 331* and *Rivera v. Mendoza, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2013, August 4, 2006, 497 SCRA 608.*
