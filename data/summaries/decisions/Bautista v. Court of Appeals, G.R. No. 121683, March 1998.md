## Legal Document Summary: *Bautista v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 121683, March 26, 1998)

**Nature:** Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Cornelio Bautista for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Facts:** Bautista, a security guard, was convicted of shooting and killing Police Lieutenant Garfin and injuring Joseph Williamson Dizon. The prosecution's case rested primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Corporal Garcia, who was present during the shooting, corroborated by ballistics evidence and a positive paraffin test on Bautista.
*   **Eyewitness Account:** Cpl. Garcia testified that Bautista emerged from the Lopa Compound and shot Lt. Garfin, who identified himself as police. Garcia positively identified Bautista as the shooter.
*   **Physical Evidence:**  NBI findings: (1) Autopsy confirmed Garfin's death due to shotgun wounds; (2) Pellets from Garfin's body matched Bautista's shotgun; (3) Only Bautista tested positive for nitrates in the paraffin test.
*   **Defense:** Bautista denied the charges, claiming he never left the compound and that the positive paraffin test resulted from cleaning firearms.  He presented a corroborating witness (another security guard).
*   **Lower Court Decision:** RTC convicted Bautista of murder, sentencing him to *prision mayor* maximum to *reclusion temporal* medium (10 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months) and ordering him to pay damages to the victim's heirs.  Acquittal on frustrated murder charges due to insufficient evidence.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the conviction but deleted the award of damages to the heirs.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Bautista is criminally liable for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court reinstated the lower court's indemnity imposed for the death of the victim, as well as the cost of the proceedings.
*   **Civil Liability:**  While the Court of Appeals initially deleted the damages awarded to the heirs, the Supreme Court *restored* the P30,000.00 indemnity for the death of the victim.
*   **Duty of Security Guard:** Implicitly, the case highlights the duty of care expected of security guards in handling firearms and responding to incidents, especially when encountering law enforcement officers.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Eyewitness:** While the court gives weight to the positive identification by Cpl. Garcia, any inconsistencies in his testimony, despite being explained, could be grounds for challenging the verdict.  The potential for bias or misidentification always exists.
*   **Paraffin Test Reliability:** The defense attempted to explain the positive paraffin test. While the court dismissed the explanation, it still presents a potential point of contention, as the reliability of paraffin tests has been questioned in other cases.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** While the affidavit of desistance from the widow was deemed insufficient to extinguish criminal liability (as per Art. 89 RPC), it could be argued that it reflects a lack of strong desire for prosecution, potentially influencing future appeals or clemency requests.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The prosecution successfully argued treachery. However, this could be challenged by arguing the attack was not completely unexpected, given the circumstances of a police chase and potential for armed confrontation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Article 89, Revised Penal Code:** Enumerates the modes of totally extinguishing criminal liability, explicitly excluding affidavits of desistance in this context.
*   ***People v. Dinglasan, 267 SCRA 26 (1997)*:** Cited regarding the definition of treachery and the possibility of treachery even in frontal attacks.
*   ***People v. Amania, 248 SCRA 286 (1995)*:** Cited regarding the prevalence of positive identification over alibi and denial.
*   ***Lopez v. Court of Appeals, 239 SCRA 562 (1994)*:** Cited regarding the effect of a witness changing their statement.
*   The case also implicitly touches on the rules of evidence regarding eyewitness testimony, physical evidence (ballistics, paraffin tests), and the discretionary power of the prosecution in choosing witnesses.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld Bautista's conviction based on the eyewitness testimony of Cpl. Garcia, corroborated by the ballistics report and positive paraffin test. The Court emphasized the prevalence of positive identification over the defense of denial and alibi. While the affidavit of desistance was not grounds for acquittal, it may still factor into future considerations regarding the sentence. Potential avenues for appeal might focus on the credibility of the eyewitness, the reliability of the paraffin test, and the presence of treachery.
