**Case Summary: *Cedric Sayco v. People*** (G.R. No. 159703, March 3, 2008)

**Facts:** Petitioner Cedric Sayco was convicted of illegal possession of a firearm (9mm Sig Sauer) and ammunition under Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866, as amended by R.A. No. 8294.  He claimed authorization via a Memorandum Receipt (MR) and Mission Order issued by the AFP.

**Issue:** Whether the MR and Mission Order constituted sufficient legal authority to possess and carry the firearm, thus negating the element of *corpus delicti* for illegal possession.

**Holding:**  Conviction affirmed. The Supreme Court held that an MR and Mission Order do not substitute for a duly issued firearms license from the PNP Firearms and Explosives Unit. Good faith is not a valid defense because illegal possession is *malum prohibitum*.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **P.D. No. 1866, Sec. 1, as amended by R.A. No. 8294:** Penalizes unlawful possession of firearms. The *corpus delicti* requires proof of possession and lack of a license or permit. The ruling clarifies that possessing both does not qualify legal possession.
*   **Section 879, 1917 Revised Administrative Code (precursor):** Originally exempted certain government officials and peace officers; however, *People v. Mapa* (1967) narrowed this exemption, excluding secret agents and civilians without formal law enforcement roles.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of P.D. No. 1866 (PC Circulars):** Defines "Mission Order" and sets limits on who can issue them and to whom. Explicitly excludes civilian agents not on the regular government plantilla.
*   **Government Auditing and Accounting Manual, Section 492:** Defines Memorandum Receipt for Equipment; however, this receipt is not a permit for carrying a weapon.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Sayco's possession was deemed illegal despite the MR and Mission Order, subjecting him to criminal penalties under R.A. 8294.
*   **Unauthorized Issuance:** Implies potential liability for the issuing officer under Section 7 of P.D. No. 1866 (unauthorized issuance of authority to carry firearms), though this was not directly addressed in the case against Sayco.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***People v. Mapa* (127 Phil. 624 (1967)):** Overruled prior jurisprudence (*People v. Macarandang*) to hold that the exemption under Section 879 of the Revised Administrative Code does not extend to secret agents.
*   ***Pastrano v. Court of Appeals* (346 Phil. 277 (1997)); *Belga v. Buban* (387 Phil. 554 (2000)):** Confirms that MR and Mission Orders cannot substitute for a proper firearms license.
*   ***People v. Neri*** (140 SCRA 406, 410):* Confirmed that in illegal possession of firearms, good faith is not a valid defense.

**Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 175 (organization of Insular Constabulary)
*   Act No. 1780 (regulated possession of firearms)
*   Act No. 2711, Sec. 879 (Revised Administrative Code of 1917)
*   P.D. No. 1866, Sec. 1 and Sec. 7 (Illegal Possession and Unauthorized Issuance)
*   R.A. No. 8294 (Amendment to P.D. No. 1866)
*   Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987)
*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 27 (Prision Correcional)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Regular Civilian Agent":** The court relies on the Implementing Rules' definition of "regular civilian agent" to exclude Sayco. The precise meaning and scope of "regular plantilla" and "regular compensation" could be subject to further interpretation in future cases.
*   **Validity of PC Circulars:** The reliance on PC Circulars (Implementing Rules of P.D. 1866), which are subordinate legislation, in interpreting the law could be challenged.
*   **Continued Applicability of Section 879, Revised Administrative Code:** Despite the later issuance of PD 1866 and RA 8294, which had provisions about illegal possession and its exceptions, the Court continued to cite this law.

**Potential Future Litigation Points:**

*   Challenges to the Implementing Rules' definition of "regular civilian agent."
*   Arguments about whether the Department of Justice and Department of Interior and Local Government's authority to issue implement Rules and Regulations but has not been adopted as of the date the decision was decided affect the application of PC Circulars
*   Challenges to whether Section 879, Revised Administrative Code, is an active law or has been repealed by P.D. No. 1866 and R.A. 8294.

**Conclusion:** The *Sayco* case reinforces the strict requirement of a PNP-issued license for firearm possession, even when an individual possesses a MR and Mission Order. It clarifies the limited scope of exemptions for government-owned firearms and civilian agents. The ruling highlights the importance of properly issued documentation for firearm possession and the risk associated with relying on informal authorizations.
