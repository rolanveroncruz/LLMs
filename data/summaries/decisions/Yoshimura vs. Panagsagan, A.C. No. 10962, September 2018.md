**Case Summary: *Akira Yoshimura v. Atty. Bernie Panagsagan*, A.C. No. 10962, September 11, 2018**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Panagsagan for Grave Misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Financial Mismanagement:** Atty. Panagsagan received sums of money from Yoshimura for various legal services related to bus registrations and cooperative memberships (Lesambah and Sta. Monica). He failed to fulfill these undertakings and did not properly account for or return the funds upon demand, totaling P404,000.00. Specific instances include:
    *   Fees for document preparation, apprehension tickets, expedite processing fees ("under the table" money), and cooperative memberships.
    *   Failure to file an estafa case after receiving fees.
*   **Ethical Violations (CPR):** Violations of Canon 16, Rules 16.01, 16.02, and 16.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) regarding the holding of client funds in trust and accounting for those funds. Failure to deliver funds upon demand.
*   **Bribery:** Solicitation of "under the table" money (P40,000.00) to expedite LTO processes constitutes an abuse of trust and undermines public faith in the legal profession.
*   **Misrepresentation/Deceit:** Convincing Yoshimura to join Sta. Monica cooperative when it was no longer operating.
*   **Notarial Law Violation:** Notarizing a management contract without the personal appearance of all affiants, contravening *Agbulos v. Atty. Viray* (704 Phil. 1, 7-8 (2013)) citing *Dela Cruz-Sillano v. Atty. Pangan* (592 Phil. 219, 227 (2008)).
*   **Disrespect to IBP:** Failure to file an answer to the complaint, despite multiple notices, and failure to attend hearings. Disregard of IBP directives, violating his duty to uphold judicial authority.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Fiduciary duty to the client.
*   Duty to account for client funds.
*   Duty to uphold the integrity of the legal profession.
*   Duty to obey lawful orders from the IBP.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative:** Disbarment from the practice of law, revocation of notarial commission, and perpetual disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public.
*   **Civil:** Ordered to return P404,000.00 to Akira Yoshimura with 6% legal interest per annum if still unpaid, within 90 days of the finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Under the table" money:** Acknowledging receipt of funds for potentially illegal purposes creates reputational risk for the profession.
*   **Receipts for "stock membership":** Unclear who actually received P380,000.00 and issued receipts.
*   **Lack of Respondent's Defense:**  Atty. Panagsagan's failure to participate in the proceedings allowed the Court to rely on Yoshimura's uncontroverted claims.
*   **Case Law & Statutory References:** The decision references relevant jurisprudence regarding disbarment, fiduciary duties, and the Code of Professional Responsibility. Statutory references are primarily the CPR.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Panagsagan's actions constituted gross misconduct, warranting disbarment and the return of funds misappropriated from the client. The court's decision hinges on the undisputed evidence presented by the complainant and Atty. Panagsagan's failure to defend himself against the allegations. The case highlights the importance of adherence to ethical duties by lawyers and the consequences of failing to do so. The ruling cites *In Re Almacen*, *Judge Noel-Bertulfo v. Nuez*, *Grefaldeo v. Judge Lacson*, *Tre√±as v. People*, *Foster v. Atty. Agtang*, *Tabang v. Atty. Gacott*, *Brennisen v. Atty. Contawi*, *Sabayle v. Tandayag*, *Daroy v. Legaspi*, *Padilla v. Atty. Samson*, *PO1 Caspe v. Atty. Mejica*, *Agbulos v. Atty. Viray*, and *Dela Cruz-Sillano v. Atty. Pangan*, to provide legal basis for the decision.
