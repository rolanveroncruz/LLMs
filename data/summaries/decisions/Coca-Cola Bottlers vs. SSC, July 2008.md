Here's a concise summary of the Coca-Cola Bottlers (Phils.), Inc. v. Social Security Commission case for legal review:

**Case:** Coca-Cola Bottlers (Phils.), Inc. v. Social Security Commission, G.R. No. 159323, July 31, 2008

**Facts:** Dr. Climaco, a former retainer physician for Coca-Cola, filed a petition with the SSC to be compulsorily covered by the SSS.  This occurred while separate complaints were pending before the NLRC where he sought recognition as a regular employee and benefits and later for illegal dismissal arising from termination of the retainer agreement. Coca-Cola moved to dismiss the SSC petition arguing no employer-employee relationship existed due to a Retainer Agreement and later on grounds of prejudicial question, forum shopping, and litis pendentia.

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the SSC's denial of Coca-Cola's motion to dismiss Dr. Climaco's petition for compulsory SSS coverage based on prejudicial question, forum shopping, and litis pendentia.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, upholding the SSC's jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Retainer Agreement:** Coca-Cola argued Dr. Climaco was a retainer physician and the agreement explicitly stated no employer-employee relationship existed. However, the CA found that the four-fold test was satisfied in a related case elevated to the Supreme Court.

*   **Prejudicial Question:** Coca-Cola argued that the pending NLRC cases (regularization and illegal dismissal) constituted a prejudicial question because their outcome (determination of employment status) would determine the SSC's jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rejected this, stating there was no pending criminal case (a required element for prejudicial question), and the issues in the NLRC cases are not determinative of whether or not the SSC should proceed. *Ocampo v. Buenaventura, G.R. No. L-32293*.

*   **Forum Shopping:** Coca-Cola contended Dr. Climaco engaged in forum shopping by pursuing the same issue (employment status) in both the NLRC and SSC. The Supreme Court rejected this, emphasizing that while the parties were identical, the causes of action (violation of the Labor Code vs. violation of the Social Security Law), the reliefs sought (employee benefits vs. SSS coverage), and the applicable laws were different. *First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115849*.

*   **Litis Pendentia:** Coca-Cola argued for dismissal based on litis pendentia due to the pending NLRC cases. The Court found that the nature of the cases filed, the rights asserted, and reliefs prayed for in each tribunal are different

*   **Rule 16, Section 1(e), 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Coca-Cola cited the rule to argue that the petition of Dr. Climaco lodged with the SSC is "another action" prohibited by the Rule, the Court citing the case of Solancio v. Ramos, G.R. No. L-20408, stated that "This phrase should be construed in line with Section 1 of Rule 2, which defines the word action, thus -

"Action means an ordinary suit in a court of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong. Every other remedy is a special proceeding."

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Labor Code:** Governing the NLRC cases related to employment status, benefits, and illegal dismissal.
*   **Social Security Law:** Governing the SSC case related to compulsory SSS coverage.
*   **Rules of Court:** Specifically, Rule 7, Sec. 5 (Certification Against Forum Shopping), Rule 16, Section 1(e)
*   **Flordelis v. Castillo, G.R. No. L-36703**: Prejudicial question
*   **People v. Aragon, 94 Phil. 357 (1954)** Prejudicial Question
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 111, Sec. 7.** Prejudicial Question
*   **Berbari v. Concepcion, 40 Phil. 837 (1920)** Prejudicial Question
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Sec. 5; 16, Section 1(e)** Forum Shopping
*   **First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115849** Forum Shopping

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The Supreme Court noted that the petitioners failed to update the Court on the resolution of the related illegal dismissal case, although the Court stated it did not moot the issue.
*   The Court noted that in a case elevated from the CA, the four-fold test was satisfied.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Coca-Cola may be liable for SSS contributions for Dr. Climaco if the SSC ultimately determines an employer-employee relationship existed, despite the Retainer Agreement.
*   Dr. Climaco has a continuing obligation to disclose any new related filings or events in any of the related proceedings.
