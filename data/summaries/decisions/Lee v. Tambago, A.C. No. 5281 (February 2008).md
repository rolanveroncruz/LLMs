**Case Summary: Lee v. Tambago, A.C. No. 5281, February 12, 2008**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Regino B. Tambago for violation of the Notarial Law and the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Allegation:** Complainant Manuel L. Lee alleged that Atty. Tambago notarized a spurious last will and testament of his father, Vicente Lee, Sr., in 1965.
*   **Defects in the Will:** The will had only two witnesses instead of the required three (Art. 804, Civil Code). The acknowledgment lacked proper notation of residence certificates of the witnesses and used an outdated residence certificate of the testator.  No copy of the will was on file in the archives, however, the Court noted that under Art. 806 of the Civil Code, the Notary Public is not required to retain a copy or file it with the Clerk of Court. Respondent also failed to make necessary entries pertaining to the will in the notarial register,
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Denied the will was spurious and alleged the complaint was harassment. Respondent did not dispute the lack of filing with archives. Presented a photocopy of his notarial register.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 5, 783, 804, 806 (formalities of wills).
*   **Revised Administrative Code (Old Notarial Law):** Sections 246 (notarial register requirements), 249 (grounds for revocation of commission), 251 (notation of residence tax).
*   **Residence Tax Act (Commonwealth Act No. 465):** Section 6 (exhibition of residence certificate).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 130, Sec. 5 (admissibility of secondary evidence), Rule 138, Sec. 20(a) (duties of attorneys).
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Canon 1, Rule 1.01 (upholding the law and avoiding unlawful conduct).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Tambago's Obligations:** As a notary public, Tambago had a duty to strictly observe the formalities of will execution and notarization, including proper identification, verification of residence certificates, and accurate record keeping. He was obligated under the old Notarial Law to make proper entries of the document and cedula certificates in his notarial register.
*   **Liability:**  Atty. Tambago was found liable for professional misconduct due to gross negligence in notarizing the will, violating his oath as a lawyer, and failing to uphold the law.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Respondent's reliance on photocopies of his notarial register and other certifications was problematic. Under Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, secondary evidence is inadmissible without proof of the unavailability of the original.
*   **Validity of the Will:** While the Court found the will void due to improper notarization and insufficient witnesses, the underlying issue of the will's validity (forgery, capacity of testator) was not fully resolved.
*   **Cause of Action:** Respondentâ€™s argument that the complainant had no cause of action against him as he did not first file an action for the declaration of nullity of the will and demand his share in the inheritance was considered but dismissed by the court

**Case Law:**

*   **Santiago v. Rafanan, A.C. No. 6252, 5 October 2004, 440 SCRA 98:** Emphasized the strict obligations and duties of notaries public.
*   Other cases cited regarding the importance of solemnities in will execution (e.g., *In re: Will of Tan Diuco, 45 Phil. 807 (1924)*), the purpose of acknowledgment (Azuela v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 122880, 12 April 2006, 487 SCRA 142), and the standard for imposing disciplinary sanctions on lawyers.

**Outcome:**

*   Atty. Tambago was found guilty of professional misconduct.
*   He was suspended from the practice of law for one year.
*   His notarial commission was revoked.
*   He was perpetually disqualified from reappointment as a notary public.

**Key Takeaways:** This case underscores the critical importance of meticulous compliance with notarial requirements and the serious consequences of negligence or dereliction of duty by notaries public, particularly lawyers. The case highlights the need for careful verification of documents, adherence to statutory formalities, and accurate record keeping.
