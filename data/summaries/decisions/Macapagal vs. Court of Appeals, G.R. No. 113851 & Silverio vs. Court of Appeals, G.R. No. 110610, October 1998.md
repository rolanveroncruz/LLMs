**Case Summary: *Macapagal v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 110610 and G.R. No. 113851, October 8, 1998**

**Nature:** Consolidated cases involving motions for reconsideration of a Supreme Court decision regarding liability of corporate officers (Macapagal and Silverio) of Philfinance for damages arising from its engagement in quasi-banking activities without a proper license, as per Section 31 of the Corporation Code.

**Key Issues:**

*   **G.R. No. 110610 (Macapagal):**  Validity of service of summons; due process violation; authority of Atty. Salva to represent Macapagal; appropriateness of remedy (certiorari vs. annulment of judgment).
*   **G.R. No. 113851 (Silverio):**  Gross negligence of Atty. Salva; impact on the finality of the judgment against Silverio.

**Decision:** Motions for reconsideration are denied with finality.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 31 (now Section 30 of the Revised Corporation Code):** Imposes potential liability on directors and officers for corporate actions exceeding their authority or violating legal provisions. The underlying case against Macapagal and Silverio involves an alleged violation of this section.
*   **Rule 14, Section 8 (now Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7 of the Rules of Court):** Relates to proper service of summons on individuals.
*   **Obligation to ensure proper representation:** Individuals have an obligation to ensure their counsel is actively representing them and pursuing all available remedies.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:**  The decision effectively upholds the lower court's judgment holding Macapagal and Silverio liable (presumably jointly and severally) for damages related to Philfinance's activities.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The denial with finality means that the judgments against Macapagal and Silverio are now res judicata. Further appeals on these specific grounds are foreclosed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 31:** Foundation for imposing liability on Macapagal as a director.
*   **Rule 14, Section 8:**  Cited by Macapagal in his challenge to the validity of service, arguing for personal service at his residence rather than at the Philfinance building.
*   **Sesbreño v. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 466 (1993); Filinvest v. Court of Appeals, 182 SCRA 664 (1990). See also PCIB v. Court of Appeals, 172 SCRA 436 (1989); Araneta v. Court of Appeals, 211 SCRA 830 (1992); Sesbreño v. Garcia, 181 SCRA 879 (1995):**Cited to show previous cases also filed by defrauded investors.
*   **Matanguihan v. Tengco, 95 SCRA 478 (1980):**Distinguished for having explicit evidence of improper service of summons, unlike the present case.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Authority of Atty. Salva:** Macapagal argues that Atty. Salva was not authorized to represent him. The court found this unpersuasive, citing Atty. Salva's actions on his behalf, including filing motions and appeals. This remains a contentious point, as Macapagal claims he was unaware of these actions.
*   **Due Diligence:**  The court found both Macapagal and Silverio lacked due diligence in monitoring the case and ensuring proper representation. This is a factual finding that is difficult to overturn on appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:**  The most immediate risk is the enforcement of the judgment against Macapagal and Silverio, including seizure of assets to satisfy the debt.
*   **Collateral Estoppel:**  The findings in this case (e.g., regarding Atty. Salva's authority) could have collateral estoppel effects in other related proceedings.
*   **Malpractice Suit:** While not explicitly stated, the court's criticisms of Atty. Salva's handling of the case suggest a potential malpractice claim, although any such claim would likely be time-barred at this point.

**Recommendations (For further investigation):**

*   Investigate the specific allegations against Macapagal under Section 31 of the Corporation Code. Determine the strength of the evidence linking his actions (or inactions) as a director to the damages suffered by Yau.
*   Thoroughly review the records of CEB-2058, AC-G.R. No. 04835, and CA-G.R. CV No. 33496 to fully understand the procedural history and the arguments presented.
*   Assess whether any alternative remedies might be available, such as negotiation with the judgment creditor or exploring possible defenses to enforcement.
*   Examine the possibility that a claim of legal malpractice against Atty. Salva could yield some reimbursement.
