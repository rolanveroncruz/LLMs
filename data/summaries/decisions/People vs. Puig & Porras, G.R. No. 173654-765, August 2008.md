**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Teresita Puig and Romeo Porras* (G.R. No. 173654-765, August 28, 2008)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition for Review on Certiorari, reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of 112 cases of Qualified Theft against respondents Teresita Puig and Romeo Porras. The Court held that the Informations sufficiently alleged the elements of Qualified Theft, specifically *taking without the consent of the owner* and the qualifying circumstance of *grave abuse of confidence*.

**Facts:**

*   Teresita Puig (Cashier) and Romeo Porras (Bookkeeper) of Rural Bank of Pototan, Inc. were charged with 112 counts of Qualified Theft.
*   The Informations alleged that they, "conspiring, confederating, and helping one another, with grave abuse of confidence, being the Cashier and Bookkeeper of the Rural Bank of Pototan, Inc., Pototan, Iloilo, without the knowledge and/or consent of the management of the Bank and with intent of gain, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and carry away" bank funds.
*   RTC dismissed the cases, finding no probable cause for arrest warrants, arguing that the "taking without consent" element was missing because depositors, not the bank, were the true owners of the money and that the Informations didn't allege the proper type of "dependence, guardianship or vigilance" for grave abuse of confidence.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Qualified Theft (Art. 310, Revised Penal Code):**  The crime is theft (Art. 308, RPC) committed with grave abuse of confidence, among other circumstances.
*   **Elements of Theft (Art. 308, RPC):** Intent to gain, unlawful taking, personal property belonging to another, absence of violence/intimidation.  Qualified Theft adds the element of grave abuse of confidence.
*   **Sufficiency of Information (Secs. 6 & 9, Rule 110, Rules of Court):**  The Information must state the acts or omissions constituting the offense in ordinary and concise language. It need not mirror the statute's exact wording, as long as it allows a person of common understanding to know the charge and allows the court to render judgment.
*   **Bank as Owner:**  The Court cited Articles 1953 and 1980 of the New Civil Code, stating that deposits in banks are governed by loan provisions. The bank becomes the *owner* of the deposited funds, creating a debtor-creditor relationship with the depositors.
*   **Grave Abuse of Confidence:**  The Court held that bank employees entrusted with handling funds occupy positions of confidence.  The Informations, by alleging the respondents' positions, the taking, intent to gain, lack of consent, and "grave abuse of confidence," sufficiently pleaded this element.
*   **Case Law:** The Court cited *Roque v. People* (teller convicted of qualified theft), *People v. Sison* (Branch Operations Officer convicted), and *People v. Locson* to illustrate the nature of a bank's possession and the sufficiency of similar allegations.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:**  Liable to face trial on 112 counts of Qualified Theft. They have a potential for criminal penalties if convicted.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** While the Court found the *allegations* sufficient, factual disputes regarding the actual taking, intent, and circumstances surrounding the alleged thefts would need to be resolved during trial.  The prosecution must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Defense Arguments:**  The respondents will likely argue factual defenses, challenge the evidence presented by the prosecution, and potentially argue mitigating circumstances.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Articles 308 (Theft), 310 (Qualified Theft)
*   New Civil Code: Articles 1953, 1980
*   Rules of Court: Rule 110, Sections 6 and 9
