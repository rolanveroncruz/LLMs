## Legal Document Summary: *Casco v. National Labor Relations Commission, Capitol Medical Center, and/or Clemente* (G.R. No. 200571)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision upholding the NLRC's reversal of a Labor Arbiter's ruling that found the Petitioner's dismissal illegal. The Supreme Court grants the appeal and reverses the CA decision.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Josephine A. Casco (Nurse Supervisor)
*   **Respondents:** National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Capitol Medical Center (Hospital), and Thelma N. Clemente (President & CEO of the Hospital)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Petitioner's Job Description:** Accountable for losses, equipment malfunction, and breakage; consistent monitoring of supply use; checking endorsement of supplies/equipment; reporting equipment malfunctions; receiving newly purchased equipment; conducting inventory of assets and supplies.
*   **Hospital's Responsibility:** To prove a valid and authorized cause for termination (Article 294 of the Labor Code). To entrust the custody of equipment for the Petitioner to be held liable for gross and habitual negligence.

**Liabilities & Grounds for Dismissal Alleged by the Employer:**
*   **Gross Negligence:**  Failure to secure hospital equipment under her custody, resulting in significant financial loss (P2.9M). The hospital claims that her negligence led to the loss of two Mindray monitors, two Pulse Oximeters, three Vaporizers, and one Endoscopy Camera.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** The hospital argues that as Nurse Supervisor, the Petitioner held a position of trust and her negligence in protecting hospital equipment resulted in a breach of that trust.

**Supreme Court Ruling & Rationale:**
The Supreme Court found that the CA erred and the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in finding that the Petitioner was validly dismissed from her employment by Private Respondents.
*   **No Gross or Habitual Negligence:**  The Court held that the hospital failed to prove that the Petitioner's job description included the task of custodian of hospital property and equipment. Her being accountable for losses and equipment malfunction did not automatically make her the custodian thereof. Even if she was deemed to be custodian of the hospital property, there was no evidence that the petitioner had wilfully and deliberately intended to be mindless of her responsibilities, or that she had been reckless as to be blameworthy for her acts or omissions.
*   **Improper Application of Loss of Trust and Confidence:** While the petitioner holds a position of trust, the respondents could not invoke the ground of loss of trust and confidence arbitrarily. While a less stringent degree of proof was required in termination cases involving managerial employees, the employers could not invoke the ground of loss of trust and confidence arbitrarily.

**Remedy:** Reinstatement to former position without loss of seniority rights and payment of backwages (Article 294, Labor Code).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Article 294 (formerly 279) of the Labor Code:**  Governs reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation (G.R. No. 183329):**  Outlines the standard of review in Rule 45 petitions in labor cases - the Court must determine whether the CA correctly identified any grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC.
*   **Nissan Motors Phils., Inc. v. Angelo (G.R. No. 164181):** Defines gross and habitual negligence as grounds for dismissal.
*   **School of the Holy Spirit of Quezon City v. Taguiam (G.R. No. 165565):** Provides that neglect of duty must be both gross and habitual.
*   **Bristol Myers Squibb (Phils.), Inc. v. Baban (G.R. No. 167449):** Specifies the requisites for valid dismissal based on loss of trust and confidence.
*   **Lima Land v. Cuevas (G.R. No. 169523):** Differentiates the treatment of managerial employees versus rank-and-file employees regarding termination based on loss of trust and confidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**
*   **Ambiguity in Job Description:** The term "accountable for losses" in the petitioner's job description could potentially be interpreted in different ways, leading to disagreement about the scope of her responsibilities.
*   **Hospital's Security Measures:**  The hospital's failure to secure the operating room, with multiple unlocked exits, could weaken their claim that the petitioner was solely responsible for the missing equipment.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court deemed the petitioner's dismissal illegal because the hospital failed to prove gross negligence or a legitimate basis for loss of trust and confidence. The Petitioner is entitled to reinstatement and backwages.
