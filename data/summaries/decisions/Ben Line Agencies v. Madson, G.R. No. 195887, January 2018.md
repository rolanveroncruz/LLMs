**Case Summary: Ben Line Agencies Philippines, Inc. v. Madson and Amorado, G.R. No. 195887 (2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the DOJ's dismissal of Ben Line's petition for review concerning an estafa complaint against Madson and Amorado.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in upholding the DOJ's dismissal of Ben Line's petition solely on procedural grounds (failure to attach clear copies of the OCP resolution) despite Ben Line's subsequent compliance via motion for reconsideration.

**Facts:**

*   Ben Line hired AALTAFIL (Madson) and ACE Logistics (Amorado) for crane services.
*   Ben Line alleged deception regarding the crane's availability and capability, leading to a complaint for estafa under Article 315(2) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   The OCP dismissed the complaint, finding no misrepresentation or conspiracy.
*   The DOJ dismissed Ben Line's petition for review due to non-compliance with Section 5 of the 2000 NPS Rule on Appeal (failure to attach clear copies).
*   Ben Line rectified this in its Motion for Reconsideration but the motion was denied.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, finding that the DOJ abused its discretion.

*   While the DOJ was initially correct in dismissing the petition for non-compliance, it erred by not reinstating it after Ben Line corrected the deficiency in its Motion for Reconsideration.
*   The SC emphasized that procedural rules should facilitate justice and should not be rigidly applied to frustrate substantial justice, citing *Air Philippines Corporation v. Zamora* (529 Phil. 718 (2006)).
*   The Court distinguished this case from *Lao v. Co, et al. (585 Phil. 134 (2008)),* noting that in this case, Ben Line attempted to fix the deficiency.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **2000 NPS Rule on Appeal, Sections 5 & 6:** Outlines the requirements for petitions for review and the grounds for dismissal due to non-compliance. Obligation of petitioner to submit legible copies of relevant documents.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315(2):** Estafa.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Estafa Liability (Respondents):**  The case is remanded to the DOJ to determine if estafa was committed.
*   **Procedural Lapses (Petitioner):** Initial failure to comply with procedural rules caused delay and legal expenses.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315(2), Revised Penal Code:** Estafa
*   **2000 NPS Rule on Appeal, Sections 5 & 6:** Rules governing appeals from Prosecutor's Office decisions to the DOJ.
*   **Air Philippines Corporation v. Zamora, 529 Phil. 718 (2006):** Liberal interpretation of procedural rules in the interest of justice.
*   **Lao v. Co, et al., 585 Phil. 134 (2008):**  Upholding dismissal of petition due to non-compliance with procedural rules.
*   **Manila Electric Company v. Atilano, 689 Phil. 394 (2012):** Discusses the requirements for the DOJ resolution in denying a petition for review.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The DOJ's initial dismissal based on procedural grounds, particularly concerning the legibility of copies when the copies were allegedly provided by the OCP itself.  This created an ambiguity as to whether the defect was genuinely attributable to Ben Line.

**Legal Analysis for Lawyer:**

This case highlights the tension between strict adherence to procedural rules and the need for substantial justice.  While the DOJ's initial action was technically correct, the SC correctly pointed out its failure to consider the rectified documents in Ben Line's Motion for Reconsideration. This signals a preference for resolving disputes on their merits rather than dismissing them on technicalities. It underscores the importance of *Air Philippines Corporation v. Zamora* in situations where strict adherence to rules would lead to injustice. Focus your analysis on whether the alleged misrepresentation regarding the crane constitutes estafa under Article 315(2) of the Revised Penal Code, considering the factual findings of the OCP (which the DOJ must now review). The procedural issue is settled in favor of Ben Line.
