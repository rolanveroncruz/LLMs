**Case Summary: *Caurdanetaan Piece Workers Union vs. Laguesma & Corfarm Grains, Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 113542 & 114911)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for certiorari under Rule 65 challenging resolutions of the Undersecretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Employer-Employee Relationship:** Whether the Caurdanetaan Piece Workers Union/Association (CPWU) members were employees of Corfarm Grains, Inc. This determination hinges on the application of the "four-fold" test: power to hire, payment of wages, power to dismiss, and control (most important).
2.  **Certification Election:**  Propriety of the Undersecretary's dismissal of the union's petition for certification election due to alleged lack of employer-employee relationship.
3.  **Illegal Dismissal:**  Whether the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in remanding the illegal dismissal case to the labor arbiter for further proceedings after the labor arbiter found in favor of the union.
4. **Unfair Labor Practice:** Whether the employer acted in bad faith.

**Holdings:**

*   The Supreme Court **granted both petitions**.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship Existed:**  Reversed the Undersecretary's ruling and held that a valid employer-employee relationship existed based on substantial evidence.  The Court emphasized Corfarm's control over the workers' activities, their integral role in Corfarm's business, and Corfarm's failure to prove that the union members were independent contractors. Referenced Article 280 of the Labor Code.
*   **Certification Election Ordered:**  Reinstated the Med-Arbiter's order for a certification election.
*   **Illegal Dismissal Upheld (with modifications):**  Reversed the NLRC's remand order and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision finding illegal dismissal, with modifications to the computation of monetary awards. The Court cited the failure of the respondent to present a position paper despite multiple opportunities. The NLRC was ordered to compute the benefits accordingly.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice sustained:** The Court sustained the labor arbiter’s finding of unfair labor practice.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Article 280, Labor Code:**  Defines regular employment; crucial in establishing the employer-employee relationship.
*   **Article 106 Labor Code:** Labor only contracting.
*   **Right to Certification Election:** Reinforces the right of employees to choose their bargaining representative through a certification election.
*   **Back Wages and Reinstatement:** Reaffirms illegally dismissed employees' entitlement to full back wages (without deductions) and reinstatement.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice:** Employer cannot engage in union busting.
*   **Procedural Due Process:**  Requirement for employers to participate in labor proceedings and provide evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Corfarm Grains, Inc.:** Liable for back wages, reinstatement, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay, wage differentials, and damages to illegally dismissed union members. Subject to an order to conduct a certification election.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of Monetary Awards:** Corrects the items in the labor arbiter’s decision. The 13th month pay, service incentive leave, underpaid wages, and refund of P12 must be calculated based on each year of service from the time of hire up to actual reinstatement.
*   **Definition of Control:** While the Court emphasizes the "control test," further litigation could arise concerning the specific aspects of control exercised by Corfarm.

**Case Law:**

* **Shoppers Gain Supermart vs. NLRC, 259 SCRA 411:** Discusses independent contractor vs employee.
*   **RJL Martinez Fishing Corp. vs. NLRC, 127 SCRA 454:** Continuity of employment is not the determining factor, but rather whether the work of the laborer is part of the regular business or occupation of the employer
*   **Brent School, Inc. vs. Zamora, 181 SCRA 702** a literal application of such article will result in “absurdity.”
*   **Bustamante vs. National Labor Relations Commission, (Resolution), 265 SCRA 61, November 28, 1996:** Computation of monetary benefits
*   **Fernandez, et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 105892, January 28, 1998:** The same computation applies to the award of the service incentive leave.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines (as amended):** Articles 106, 279, 280, 281, etc.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Certiorari proceedings.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 133, Section 5:** Substantial evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Affidavits of adhesion of only three workers cannot work against petitioner union’s cause.
*   It is axiomatic that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer always has the burden of proof.
