## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Estrera*, G.R. No. 106233

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting the accused, Robinson Estrera, of rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The RTC sentenced Estrera to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to indemnify the complainant, Ester Estrera Mistula, for P40,000.00. The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision and acquitted Estrera.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Estrera was charged with raping Ester Mistula by means of force and intimidation, using a knife, on May 1, 1991.
*   **Complainant's Testimony:** Ester claimed Estrera seized her, threatened her with a knife, forcibly undressed her, and raped her for approximately 1.5 hours, resulting in bleeding. She delayed reporting the incident for 15 days.
*   **Medical Evidence:** Dr. Celestial's examination revealed a "healed hymenal laceration" but "no evidence of abrasion nor hematoma."
*   **Defense:** Estrera admitted to consensual sexual intercourse with Ester on two occasions, denying force or intimidation. He alleged Ester fabricated the rape charge after being publicly humiliated by his wife.
*   **Corroborating Witnesses:**
    *   Sister Rosie Mistula testified about Estrera's attempted abduction on other occasions (May 11 and May 15, 1991), and alleged prior rape of an older sister Laura Mistula.
    *   Rudileo Mistula testified Estrera's wife Alicia offered settlement.
*   **Accused's Wife Testimony:** Claimed an affair between her husband and the victim was going on and that the victim was later publicly humiliated.
*   **RTC Rationale:** Convicted based on the complainant's positive testimony, the alleged flight of the accused, and the supposed offer of compromise by the accused's wife.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **N/A:** Since the accused was acquitted, there are no outstanding obligations or liabilities.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistent Testimony:** The Supreme Court found inconsistencies and improbabilities in the complainant's testimony (detailed recollection of hand movements, extended duration of the act, lack of struggle despite alleged force).
*   **Lack of Corroborating Evidence:** The absence of physical evidence corroborating the use of force (no abrasions or hematomas) weakens the prosecution's case.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The unexplained delay in reporting the alleged rape is a significant factor undermining the complainant's credibility.
*   **Motive for False Accusation:** Evidence suggests a potential motive for the false accusation (humiliation by the accused's wife).
*   **Ambiguity of Compromise Offer:** The alleged offer of compromise by the accused's wife is disputed, and even if true, cannot be imputed to the accused as an admission of guilt. *People v. Godoy, 250 SCRA 676 (1995).*
*   **Credibility of Witness testimony:** The testimonies of the victim and the accused's wife are contradicting

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (Rape):** Defines the elements of rape.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The Supreme Court emphasizes the constitutional presumption of innocence and the need for clear and convincing evidence to overcome it.
*   **Complainant's Testimony:** While convictions can be based on the lone testimony of the complainant, the testimony must be clear, positive, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. *People v. Godoy, 250 SCRA 676 (1995).*
* **People v. Godoy, 250 SCRA 676 (1995):** Admissibility of circumstantial evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction based on the implausibility of the complainant's account, lack of physical evidence, unexplained delay in reporting, and the potential for a false accusation motivated by personal animosity. The Court held that the prosecution failed to prove the elements of rape (particularly the use of force or intimidation) beyond a reasonable doubt.
