**Case Summary: *People v. Guillera*, G.R. No. 175829 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Dolorico and Gary Guillera for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** Appellants Dolorico and Gary Guillera, along with Francisco Guillera (at large), were charged with the murder of Enrique Hernandez. The prosecution's key witness, the victim's wife, testified that she witnessed the appellants and Francisco attack and kill her husband with bolos. The defense presented alibi, claiming the appellants were elsewhere at the time of the crime.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Conviction:** Affirmed. Both appellants were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder.
*   **Treachery:** Established; attack from behind prevented the victim from defending himself.
*   **Conspiracy:** Established; concerted attack indicated a joint purpose and intent to kill.
*   **Alibi:** Rejected as the defense was weak, easily fabricated, and difficult to disprove; no satisfactory proof of physical impossibility of the accused to be at the crime scene at the time of its commission; defense failed to present credible witnesses who could attest to their whereabouts.
*   **Witness Credibility:** Positive identification by the victim's wife was given full faith and credit. Relationship to the victim *strengthened* credibility as there was no improper motive to falsely accuse, citing *Velasco v. People*, G.R. No. 166479 (2006) and *People v. Nicolas*, G.R. No. 137782 (2003). In the absence of evidence showing that the principal witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that they were not so actuated and their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit, citing *Tadeja v. People*, G.R. No. 145336 (2006) and *People v. Celis*, G.R. Nos. 125307-09 (1999). The defense failed to show any evidence that there was an improper motive to falsely testify against them.
*   **Damages:**
    *   *Civil Liability:* P50,000 (CA lowered civil liability from P60,000.)
    *   *Moral Damages:* P50,000
    *   *Actual Damages:* Reduced to P25,000 as temperate damages. The original P70,000 award for actual damages was based on a list of expenses, not official receipts. Failure to provide receipts is a critical error. *People v. Buenavidez*, G.R. No. 141120 (2003); *People v. Hate*, G.R. No. 145712 (2002).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Joint and several liability for civil liability, moral damages, and temperate damages.
*   Reclusion Perpetua

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Sole Witness Testimony:** While the court found the wife's testimony credible, reliance on a single witness (especially when the witness is closely related to the victim) can be a point of scrutiny.
