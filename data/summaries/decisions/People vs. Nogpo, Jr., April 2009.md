## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Nogpo, Jr.*, G.R. No. 184791

**Type:** Decision on Appeal (Rule 45) affirming RTC conviction for Rape under Art. 266-A(1)(a) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353).

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A(1)(a), Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines Rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation. This is the core statutory basis for the charge.
*   **Art. 266-B, Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Prescribes the penalty for rape under paragraph 1 of Art. 266-A as *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Indemnity & Moral Damages:** Awarded as standard relief in rape convictions.

**Factual Background:**

*   Accused-Appellant Pedro Nogpo, Jr. was charged with raping AAA on March 9, 2001.
*   Prosecution presented evidence including AAA's testimony of forced intercourse, medical evidence of physical trauma (hematoma, tenderness), and witness testimony placing Nogpo at the scene.
*   Defense argued consensual sex ("sweetheart theory"). Nogpo claimed a long-term affair. Sister corroborated the supposed affair.

**Holding & Rationale:**

*   **Affirmed RTC conviction:** The Court of Appeals upheld the RTC's finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Credibility of Private Complainant:** The Court emphasized the importance of direct testimony, especially when corroborated by material evidence.
*   **Rejection of "Sweetheart Theory":** The Court dismissed Nogpo's defense of consensual sex. No credible evidence (love letters, photos, etc.) supported the claim, and corroboration came only from a relative, weakening its credibility.
*   **Force and Intimidation Established:** Medical evidence and AAA's testimony proved force. Law does not impose the burden on the private complainatn to prove resistance.
*   **Flight as Indicium of Guilt:** Nogpo's flight to Quezon province after the incident was considered evidence of guilt.
*   **Reliance on Trial Court's Credibility Assessment:** The Court gave significant deference to the RTC's assessment of witness credibility, as the trial court observed their demeanor.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant: Serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant: Pay civil indemnity of P50,000.00 to AAA.
*   Accused-Appellant: Pay moral damages of P50,000.00 to AAA.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Rape, punishable by *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Civil Liability: Monetary compensation for damages suffered by AAA.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Weak Corroboration of Prosecution Witness Delloro**: Witness's testimony places Nogpo at the scene
*   **Defense Argument**: Victim's testimony contains conflicting statements, with some inconsistencies regarding what she told her husband.
*   **Minor Discrepancies in Testimony**: Minor inconsistencies in testimony usually strengthen credibility.
*   **"Sweetheart Theory" Defense:** The case hinges on the credibility of the parties.
*   **Degree of Resistance:** This is considered relative to the circumstances.
    *   *People v. Casao* (G.R. No. 100913, 23 March 1993): Held that the "sweetheart theory" in rape is not credible on the bare testimony of the accused.
    *   *People v. Vallena* (314 Phil. 679, 688 (l995)): Held that rape could still have been committed if he had carnal knowledge with private complainant against her will.
    *   *People v. Manahan* (374 Phil. 77, 84 (1999)): Held that a sweetheart cannot be forced to have sex against her will.
