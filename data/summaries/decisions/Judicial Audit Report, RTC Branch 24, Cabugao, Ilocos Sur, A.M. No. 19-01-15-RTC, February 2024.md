**Re: A.M. No. 19-01-15-RTC - Judge Raphiel F. Alzate**

**Summary:**

This resolution concerns Judge Raphiel F. Alzate and his failure to comply with a prior Supreme Court resolution imposing a 5-year suspension and a fine. After initially being dismissed for gross ignorance of the law and gross misconduct (A.M. No. 19-01-15-RTC, September 1, 2020), the penalty was reduced to suspension and a fine on reconsideration (Resolution of April 18, 2023). Judge Alzate paid the fine and resumed his judicial duties without serving the remainder of the suspension period. The Supreme Court has now found him guilty of grave misconduct and insubordination for deliberately defying the suspension order, resulting in his dismissal from service.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Original Decision (September 1, 2020):** Judge Alzate found guilty of gross ignorance of the law and gross misconduct; dismissed with forfeiture of benefits.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration (April 18, 2023):** Penalty reduced to 5-year suspension (including 1-year preventive suspension) and PHP 200,000.00 fine.
*   **Manifestation and Compliance (February 5, 2024):** Judge Alzate reported payment of the fine and resumption of judicial duties.
*   **Current Resolution (February 20, 2024):** Judge Alzate found guilty of grave misconduct and insubordination; dismissed with forfeiture of benefits.

**Obligations:**

*   Judge Alzate was obligated to serve the remainder of his 5-year suspension after receiving the Resolution of April 18, 2023.
*   He was obligated to obey the directives of the Supreme Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Alzate is liable for grave misconduct and insubordination.
*   He faces dismissal from service and forfeiture of benefits.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Potential disbarment proceedings given the severity of the misconduct.
*   Possible criminal charges depending on the nature of the underlying misconduct in the annulment cases and any evidence of obstruction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 19-01-15-RTC (September 1, 2020):** Original decision finding Judge Alzate guilty.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:** Relates to violations concerning annulment of marriage cases, which formed part of the initial charges, but he was exonerated from blatant violations.
*   **Dr. Alday v. Judge Cruz, Jr., 426 Phil 385 (2002):** Cited as precedent for dismissing a judge for deliberate refusal to obey a Supreme Court order.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no apparent ambiguous clauses in the current resolution. The main issue is Judge Alzate's deliberate defiance of a clear order from the Supreme Court. The court explicitly states it is not accepting any arguments of misinterpretation of the order.
*   The alleged participation of Atty. Ma. Saniata Liwliwa G. Alzate in the questioned Decisions on the annulment of marriage cases issued by Judge Raphiel F. Alzate should still be investigated by the Office of the Bar Confidant.

**Legally Precise Notes:**

The Supreme Court based its decision on Judge Alzate's clear disregard for its prior resolution. The Court viewed his actions as a deliberate attempt to mislead it and resume his duties without serving the remainder of his suspension. This defiance constituted grave misconduct and insubordination, warranting the penalty of dismissal. The Court explicitly stated that directives from it are not to be treated lightly, particularly on the basis of misinterpretation.
