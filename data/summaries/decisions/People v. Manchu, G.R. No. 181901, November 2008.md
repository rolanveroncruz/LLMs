## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Manchu, G.R. No. 181901

**Nature:** Criminal case; Appeal of a murder conviction.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Emilio Manchu guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. However, the award of damages was modified.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder of Roque Cupido on August 5, 1998, in Lavezares, Northern Samar.
*   **Accusation:** Emilio Manchu, along with unknown others, attacked and hacked Roque Cupido with a "sundang," causing his death. Prosecution alleged motive was victim interfering in Manchu's marriage with the victim's sister.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimony of Enerito Cupido, Jr. (victim's brother) who identified Manchu at the scene. He claimed to have witnessed Manchu and two others enter the victim's house and carry him away before the hacking occured. No direct evidence of Manchu hacking the victim.
*   **Defense:** Manchu asserted alibi, claiming he was fishing at another location, corroborated by two witnesses.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The RTC convicted Manchu based on circumstantial evidence, finding Enerito's testimony credible and rejecting the alibi. The CA affirmed.

**Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Sufficiency of Circumstantial Evidence:** The Supreme Court held that circumstantial evidence was sufficient for conviction, satisfying the requirements of Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules on Evidence.
*   **Positive Identification:** The Court emphasized that positive identification could be established by one who has seen the accused at the scene of the crime on or about the time of the incident (Baleros, Jr. v. People, G.R. No. 138033).
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of Enerito's credibility.
*   **Alibi & Denial:** The Court rejected Manchu's alibi and denial as inherently weak and unsubstantiated.
*   **Penalty:** The Court upheld the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*, finding the trial court's reasoning on the basis of the penaltyâ€™s medium period incorrect, but the result proper given the lack of mitigating or aggravating circumstances, and considering treachery as a qualifying, not aggravating, circumstance.
*   **Damages:** The Court modified the damages award, separating moral and exemplary damages, awarding P50,000 for civil indemnity, P50,000 for moral damages, and P25,000 for exemplary damages due to the qualifying circumstance of treachery.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Reliance on circumstantial evidence is always subject to scrutiny. Manchu could argue that the chain of circumstances is incomplete or permits other reasonable interpretations.
*   **Witness Credibility:** The conviction hinges heavily on the testimony of Enerito Cupido, Jr. Challenges to his credibility (e.g., bias, inconsistencies) could undermine the conviction.
*   **Identification Under Limited Visibility:**  The defense argued insufficient lighting prevented reliable identification. While the Court rejected this, it could be a point of further argument.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 248:** Defines murder and its penalty (reclusion perpetua to death).
*   **Rules of Evidence, Rule 133, Section 4:** Addresses the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence for conviction.
