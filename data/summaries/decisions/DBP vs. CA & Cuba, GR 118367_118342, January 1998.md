## Legal Document Summary: DBP vs. CA and Cuba (G.R. No. 118342 & 118367)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review of a Court of Appeals decision regarding the validity of DBP's appropriation of Lydia Cuba's leasehold rights over a fishpond used as security for loans.

**Key Issue:** Whether DBP validly appropriated Cuba's leasehold rights without foreclosure proceedings, and the validity of subsequent transactions (Deed of Conditional Sale, etc.)

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Loans and Security:** Cuba obtained loans from DBP secured by "Assignments of Leasehold Rights" over her fishpond. The promissory notes referenced mortgage foreclosure.
*   **DBP's Action:** DBP appropriated Cuba's leasehold rights without judicial or extrajudicial foreclosure after Cuba defaulted on the loans. This is the core of the dispute.
*   **Cuba's Argument:** DBP's appropriation violated Article 2088 of the Civil Code (pactum commissorium), making all subsequent transactions void.
*   **DBP's Argument:** The Assignments were not mortgages but a *cession en pago* or *dacion en pago* or a valid exercise of contractual rights under the Assignment, giving them the right to manage and sell Cuba's interest.
*   **Article 2088, Civil Code (Pactum Commissorium):** Prohibits a creditor from appropriating or disposing of things given as security for a debt. Any contrary stipulation is void.
*   **Condition No. 12 of the Assignment:** Granted DBP authority as attorney-in-fact to take possession, lease, sell, etc., in case of default.  This condition was key in determining that it was not pactum commissorium, but DBP overstepped this provision.
*   **Damages:** The trial court awarded substantial actual, moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals reduced some awards and deleted others.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   **DBP:** Ordered to render an accounting of income derived from the fishpond and apply it towards Cuba's debt (repairs, taxes, interest, principal). Ordered to pay reduced moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Cuba:** Remains obligated on the underlying debt, subject to proper accounting and foreclosure (if appropriate).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Assignments of Leasehold Rights":** The document uses language suggesting both a mortgage and an absolute assignment, creating ambiguity. The Court determined it was intended as a mortgage given the simultaneous execution of the notes with the loan guarantee.
*   **Condition No. 12 (Power of Attorney):** While the court found this did not constitute *pactum commissorium* on its face, DBP actions exceeded the scope of authority granted. There's a risk DBP could argue that it was merely acting as attorney-in-fact when it appropriated the property.
*   **Accounting:**  The remand for accounting is a potential source of further litigation, as both sides will dispute the appropriate credits and debits.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2088, Civil Code:** Prohibition of pactum commissorium.
*   **Article 1255, Civil Code:** Cession in payment, requires multiple creditors.
*   **Article 1245, Civil Code:** Dation in payment, which must be governed by sale.
*   **Article 2087, Civil Code:** Authorizes mortgagee to foreclose and alienate.
*   **People's Bank & Trust Co. vs. Odom (64 Phil. 126):** Assignment to guarantee an obligation is a mortgage.
*   **Philippine Bank of Commerce v. De Vera (6 SCRA 1026):** Assignment as security, not satisfaction.
*   **Uy Tong v. Court of Appeals (161 SCRA 383):** Defines elements of pactum commissorium.
*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Law on extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages.
*   **Eugenio v. Perdido (97 Phil. 41):** Estoppel cannot validate illegal acts.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned part of the Court of Appeals decision and essentially sided with Cuba's argument that DBP's act of appropriating the leasehold rights without foreclosure was illegal. Although the document itself, and Condition No. 12, was found to be not pactum commissorium on its face, it was still an illegal act given that it was still considered a mortgage. DBP acted improperly and is liable for damages and must render an accounting. The case is remanded for a detailed accounting to determine the final financial obligations between the parties.
