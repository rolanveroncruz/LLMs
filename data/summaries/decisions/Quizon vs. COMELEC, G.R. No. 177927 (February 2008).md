## Legal Document Summary - *Quizon vs. COMELEC and Puno* (G.R. No. 177927)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Mandamus

**Core Issue:** Whether the COMELEC can be compelled via mandamus to resolve a petition for disqualification and cancellation of certificate of candidacy (COC) filed against congressional candidate Roberto V. Puno.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Background:** Florante Quizon filed a petition (SPA-07-290) to disqualify Roberto Puno based on alleged residency misrepresentation and inaccurate district designation in Puno's COC.
*   **COMELEC Ruling:** The COMELEC Second Division dismissed the petition, finding Puno to be a resident of the correct district and thus qualified (July 31, 2007 Resolution). Quizon then filed MR with COMELEC En Banc which remained unresolved.
*   **Petition for Mandamus:** Quizon filed a petition for mandamus to compel COMELEC to resolve his disqualification petition, arguing unreasonable delay deprived him of his right to be declared the winner.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for mandamus.

**Key Holdings & Reasoning:**

1.  **Mootness:** The COMELEC's resolution of the disqualification petition (July 31, 2007) rendered the mandamus petition moot. The Court recognized exceptions to the mootness doctrine (grave constitutional violation, paramount public interest, formulation of controlling principles, capable of repetition yet evading review - *David v. Macapagal-Arroyo*), but found none applicable.
2.  **Mandamus Inappropriateness:** Mandamus compels ministerial, not discretionary, acts (*Sison v. Court of Appeals*). Disqualifying a candidate is a quasi-judicial function (*Cipriano v. Commission on Elections*), requiring discretion; the court can only compel COMELEC to *act*, not *how* to act.
3.  **Lack of Clear Legal Right:** Quizon failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief sought. He argued Puno's votes were "stray," entitling Quizon to be proclaimed the winner, but this argument lacked merit.
4.  **Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** The court cited *Salcedo II v. COMELEC* in concluding that the 15-day period to decide disqualification cases is merely *directory*. Under Sec. 6 RA 6646, final judgment before election is required for votes of a disqualified candidate to be considered stray (*Codilla Sr. v. De Venecia*). As there was no final judgment of disqualification before the election, Puno's votes were valid.
5.  **COC Technicalities:** The court stated that provisions on COC requirements (signing, swearing, information) are mandatory *before* elections, but directory *afterwards* to effectuate voter intent (*Sinaca v. Mula*, *Bautista v. Commission on Elections*). Puno won by a large margin.
6.  **Second Placer Rule:**  Even if Puno were disqualified, Quizon (the second placer) would not be entitled to the seat (*Ocampo v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal*). This reiterates the longstanding principle that a losing candidate cannot be proclaimed the winner simply due to the winner's ineligibility.
7.  **Failure to exhaust administrative remedies:** Quizon filed for MR to the En Banc, but should have waited for a denial before elevating to this court.

*   *Bautista v. Commission on Elections* (COC Requirements)
*   *Ocampo v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal* (Second Placer Rule)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Delay in Resolution:** While the Court ruled the mandamus petition moot, the initial delay in resolving the disqualification petition (especially close to the election) could raise concerns about the COMELEC's efficiency in handling such cases.
*   **COC inaccuracies:** The ambiguous district designation on Puno's COC, though ultimately deemed insignificant due to the election outcome, could be grounds for future challenges if such inaccuracies mislead voters.
*   **Continued Litigation in the HRET:** This decision does not preclude Quizon from pursuing his challenge to Puno's qualifications before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET), where questions of residency and other qualifications ultimately reside after the election.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's dismissal of the disqualification petition, effectively affirming Puno's victory. This case underscores the limited scope of mandamus against the COMELEC, the importance of timely filing disqualification petitions, and the application of the "second placer" rule. Any future challenges must be pursued before the HRET.
