## Legal Document Summary: Office of the Ombudsman vs. Torres

**Case:** *Office of the Ombudsman v. Marian D. Torres, Maricar D. Torres, and Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 168309)*

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration of a prior Decision reversing the Court of Appeals and reinstating the Ombudsman's finding of administrative guilt for dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents (Daily Time Records - DTRs).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Initial Ombudsman Decision:** Found Marian and Maricar Torres administratively liable.
*   **Grounds for Reconsideration:**
    *   Lack of evidence of falsification due to non-presentation of DTRs for specific periods (1995-1997 for Maricar; May 1996-1997 for Marian).
    *   "On-call" nature of their positions.
    *   Lack of criminal intent/malice.
    *   No damage caused to the government.
    *   Improper handling of administrative case dismissal
    *   Applicability of *Aguinaldo v. Santos*.
*   **Court's Ruling on Reconsideration:**
    *   **Partially Granted.**
    *   *Aguinaldo v. Santos* (condonation doctrine) does not apply to Maricar because she held an appointive position not an elective one.
    *   Malice is not a prerequisite for administrative falsification. Knowledge of falsity is sufficient (malum prohibitum).
    *   Damage to the government is arguable, as public funds were paid for time not worked.
    *   The Ombudsman has discretion to investigate beyond one year.
    *   Dismissal of a criminal case does not automatically dismiss related administrative charges.
    *   **Crucially, the Court held that absent the presentation of the actual DTRs allegedly falsified, the finding of falsification for the periods 1995-1997 (Maricar) and May 1996-1997 (Marian) was not supported by substantial evidence.** The Court cited exceptions to the general rule of deference to administrative agency findings, specifically, findings based on speculation or misapprehension of facts.
    *   Maricar was exonerated due to lack of evidence.
    *   Marian was found liable only for the period May 1998 to December 2000, where DTRs and evidence of conflicting class schedules were presented.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Maricar Torres: No liability.
*   Marian Torres: Administrative penalty reduced. As she is no longer employed by the LGU, the original suspension was replaced with a fine of P5,000.00.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act):** Sec. 20, paragraph 5 grants the Ombudsman discretion on investigating offenses beyond one year.
*   ***Aguinaldo v. Santos***:** Doctrine of condonation (inapplicable to Maricar).
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Cited regarding Falsification, although the administrative offense does not require the same elements as the felony.
*   **Tecson v. Sandiganbayan:** Dismissal of a criminal case does not automatically dismiss related administrative charges.
*   **Rubio v. Munar, Jr.:** Established the exceptions to the general rule of deference to administrative agency findings of fact.
*   **Pleyto v. Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG):**  Affirms the need for substantial evidence to prove affirmative allegations in administrative cases.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Rule:** The Court emphasized that administrative findings must be supported by substantial evidence. The Ombudsman's failure to present the allegedly falsified DTRs for certain periods was fatal to their case against Maricar and partially successful in mitigating the penalty against Marian.
*   **Exceptions to Deference:**  The Court's reliance on exceptions to the deference normally given to administrative agencies suggests a willingness to scrutinize factual findings if they appear to be based on speculation or misapprehension. This is a key point of contention.
*   **Penalty Substitution:** The substitution of a fine for suspension due to Marian's separation from service is a standard practice, but the legal basis for the specific fine amount could be challenged.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

This case concerns the administrative liability of two government employees for alleged falsification of DTRs. The Supreme Court partially granted a Motion for Reconsideration, exonerating one employee (Maricar) due to lack of substantial evidence (specifically, failure to present the allegedly falsified DTRs for the period in question). The other employee (Marian) remained liable, but the penalty was reduced to a fine because she was no longer employed by the government. This case highlights the importance of presenting concrete evidence in administrative proceedings, even where malice is not a required element. It also clarifies the inapplicability of the condonation doctrine in *Aguinaldo v. Santos* to appointees rather than elected officials. The key takeaway is the Court's willingness to scrutinize administrative findings that lack evidentiary support.
