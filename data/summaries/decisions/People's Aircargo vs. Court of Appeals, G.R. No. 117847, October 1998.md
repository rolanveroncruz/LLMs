**Case:** *People’s Aircargo and Warehousing Co. Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Stefani Saño* (G.R. No. 117847, October 07, 1998)

**Summary:** This case addresses the enforceability of contracts entered into by a corporate president without express board approval, specifically focusing on the doctrine of apparent authority and ratification. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ordering People's Aircargo to pay Stefani Saño P400,000 for services rendered.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **First Contract (Feasibility Study):** Valid agreement, fully paid, establishes a precedent for Punsalan's authority.
*   **Second Contract (Operations Manual & Seminar):**  Disputed agreement for P400,000. Obligation arises to pay for services rendered after acceptance and utilization of deliverables.
*   **Apparent Authority:** Central issue.  Court held the president possessed apparent authority to bind the corporation.
*   **Ratification:** Corporation accepted the operations manual, submitted it to the Bureau of Customs, and benefited from the seminar. This constituted ratification, binding the company.

**Liabilities:**

*   People's Aircargo is liable for P400,000 to Saño.
*   Potential liability if the corporation acted in bad faith in denying the contract's validity after benefiting from Saño's services.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Board Resolution:**  The absence of a board resolution authorizing the Second Contract is the main point of contention. The Court deemed this deficiency overcome by apparent authority and ratification.
*   **"Badges of Fraud":** Petitioner argued several points indicating fraud in the contract execution: missing documents, delays in payment, and errors in the contract. The court dismissed these as insufficient to establish fraud.
*   **Valuation of Services:** The original trial court reduced the payment to P60,000 citing typical consultancy rates.  The CA overturned, enforcing the contract price.
*   **Simulation Argument:**  The defense attempted to prove the contract was simulated to avoid the obligation to pay. The court rejected this as there was no proof of a simulation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 23:** Corporate powers exercised by the Board of Directors, but powers can be delegated.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1345, 1355:** Regarding simulated contracts and inadequacy of cause.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1403(2), 1405:** Regarding ratification of unenforceable contracts by acceptance of benefits.
*   **Board of Liquidators v. Kalaw (20 SCRA 987):** Distinguished; apparent authority can be established without a large quantity of prior acts.
*   **Yao Ka Sin Trading v. Court of Appeals (209 SCRA 763):** Cited for definition and application of apparent authority.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None are apparent from the summary alone; the central dispute revolves around the president's authority to bind the corporation, not ambiguous contractual language.

**Legal Precision & Notes:**

*   The core holding relies heavily on the principle of *estoppel* – People's Aircargo is estopped from denying the president's authority given their prior conduct and acceptance of benefits.
*   Defense counsel should note that the Court gave weight to the fact that the corporation allowed the President to make transactions without board authorization, and that they accepted the benefits of the second contract by presenting the feasibility study.
*   The Court treats the "grave abuse of discretion" argument of petitioner as one of legal error.
