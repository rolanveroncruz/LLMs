Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Marieta C. Azcueta vs. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 180668, May 26, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' reversal of the RTC decision which declared the marriage of Petitioner Marietta Azcueta and Rodolfo Azcueta null and void *ab initio* under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Art. 36, Family Code:**  Petitioner sought nullity based on the respondent-husband's alleged psychological incapacity to fulfill essential marital obligations.
*   **Grounds Alleged:** Emotional immaturity, irresponsibility, financial dependence on his mother, refusal to seek employment, unsatisfactory sexual relationship, and physical violence while intoxicated.
*   **Expert Testimony:** Psychiatrist Dr. Cecilia Villegas diagnosed the husband with Dependent Personality Disorder associated with severe inadequacy, existing before the marriage but manifesting after. Dr. Villegas didn't personally examine the husband, relying on information provided by the wife.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** RTC declared the marriage void based on the wife's evidence and the expert testimony.
*   **Appellate Court Decision:** CA reversed, finding insufficient proof of psychological incapacity, its existence at the time of marriage, or its grave and incurable nature. The CA also questioned the reliance on the psychiatrist's report due to the lack of a direct examination of the husband.

**Legal Issues:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Whether the totality of evidence presented by the petitioner was sufficient to prove the psychological incapacity of the husband pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code and prevailing jurisprudence.
* Whether the lack of personal examination of the respondent spouse by the psychologist/psychiatrist is fatal to proving psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reinstating the RTC decision declaring the marriage void *ab initio*.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The SC emphasized that personal examination of the respondent spouse isn't a *sine qua non* for proving psychological incapacity and that the totality of evidence is the determining factor.  It affirmed the validity of expert testimony based on interviews with one party, corroborated by other witnesses.
*   **Molina Guidelines (Republic v. Molina, 268 SCRA 198):** The Court found sufficient compliance with the *Molina* guidelines, emphasizing that the incapacity was grave, existing at the time of marriage, and incurable.
*   **Dependent Personality Disorder:**  The SC cited *Te v. Te* and expanded on how Dependent Personality Disorder can render a party incapable of fulfilling marital obligations.

**Obligations, Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Petitioner had the burden of proving psychological incapacity.
*   **Risk:** The case highlights the risk of relying solely on one spouse's account in psychological evaluations, though this was mitigated by corroborating testimony in this case.
*   **Obligation of the State:**  The SC reiterated the State's obligation to protect marriage as an inviolable social institution, while also recognizing that enforcing a marriage where one party is psychologically incapacitated is contrary to its purpose.
*   **Family Code, Articles 68-71:** The case emphasizes the marital obligations outlined in these articles (living together, mutual love/respect, support) and how psychological incapacity can prevent fulfillment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:**  Ground for declaration of nullity of marriage.
*   **Republic v. Molina, 268 SCRA 198 (1997):** Established guidelines for interpreting Article 36.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals, 310 Phil. 21 (1995):** Defined the characteristics of psychological incapacity (gravity, juridical antecedence, incurability).
*   **Te v. Te, G.R. No. 161793 (2009):**  Discussed Dependent Personality Disorder in the context of Article 36.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Issues:**

*   The definition and application of "psychological incapacity" under Article 36 remain somewhat subjective, requiring careful examination of the specific facts of each case.
*   The weight given to expert testimony in the absence of a direct examination of the respondent spouse can be contentious and subject to scrutiny.
*   The court recognizes there is no singular fact pattern that would define what the definition and application of psychological incapacity would be in cases of marriage annulment or declaration of nullity.
*   The line between mere marital difficulties and true psychological incapacity can be difficult to draw, and appellate courts may disagree with trial court findings on this issue.
