## Legal Document Summary: *Salazar v. Felias* G.R. No. 213972 (2018)

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's affirmation of the execution of a final RTC judgment in a Recovery of Ownership, Possession and Damages case.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** The Supreme Court (SC) reiterated the principle of immutability of final judgments. The RTC decision in the recovery case had become final and executory as far back as March 2004, making it the "law of the case."
*   **Issue Preclusion (Res Judicata):** Felicitas' claim of deprivation of due process due to non-impleadment was already litigated and decided against her in a prior Petition for Annulment of Judgment (CA-G.R. SP No. 95592, affirmed by SC in G.R. No. 185056). This bars relitigation of the same issue.
*   **Heir Bound by Judgment:** As an heir of the original defendants, Felicitas is bound by the judgment against her predecessors-in-interest.
*   **Family Home Exemption:** Felicitas' claim that the property is exempt from execution as a family home was rejected due to lack of evidence. The Court highlighted the requirements for establishing a family home under the Family Code (Art. 155) and relevant jurisprudence, including: proper constitution, joint establishment by spouses/unmarried head, actual residence, property ownership, and value limitations.
*   **Failure of Proof:** Felicitas failed to present evidence that the property met the requirements of a family home. Furthermore, she admitted residing elsewhere (Mu√±oz, Nueva Ecija), and the RTC previously ruled that the property belonged to the Heirs of Nivera since the 1950s.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Heirs of Lastimosa (including Felicitas) are obligated to vacate the subject property and surrender possession to the Heirs of Nivera, per the RTC judgment.
*   Heirs of Lastimosa remain liable for the damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs as detailed in the RTC decision.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary risk is continued resistance to the execution of a final judgment, which may result in further sanctions and cost.
*   No particularly ambiguous or contentious clauses were evident in the decision. The key disputes centered on factual issues (family home status, residence) and the application of established legal principles (res judicata, binding effect of judgment on heirs).

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Immutability of Judgments:** *Mayor Vargas, et al. v. Cajucom*, 761 Phil. 43 (2015); *Philippine Economic Zone Authority v. Borreta*, 519 Phil. 637 (2006).
*   **Family Home Exemption:** Article 155 of the Family Code; *Ramos, et al. v. Pangilinan, et al.*, 639 Phil. 192 (2010); *Spouses Kelley, Jr. v. Planters Products, Inc., et al.*, 579 Phil. 763 (2008); *Honrado v. CA*, 512 Phil. 657 (2005); *Manacop v. CA*, 342 Phil. 735 (1997).
*   **Res Judicata:**  Implied from the affirmation of the denial of the Petition for Annulment of Judgement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the execution of the final RTC judgment due to the principles of finality of judgment, res judicata, and the failure to adequately prove the family home exemption.  Further legal challenges are unlikely to succeed given the established precedent and factual findings.
