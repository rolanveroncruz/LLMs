**Case:** *Venerando C. Olandria v. Eugenio E. Fuentes, Jr.*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Date:** June 27, 2018

**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding grave misconduct, gross dereliction of duty, and gross ignorance of the law against a Sheriff IV.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Rule 57, Section 6 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates the sheriff to provide a full statement of proceedings under a writ of attachment and a complete inventory of attached property.
*   **2017 Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), Rule 10, Section 50(D)(1):** Defines Simple Neglect of Duty as a less grave offense, punishable by suspension for the first offense.
*   **RRACCS, Rule 10, Section 53(k):** Considers "first offense" as a mitigating circumstance.
*   **RRACCS, Rule 10, Section 54:** States the minimum penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating circumstances are present.
*   **RRACCS, Rule 10, Section 52(b):** Allows a fine in place of suspension if the respondent is discharging frontline functions.
*   **RRACCS, Rule 10, Section 56(d):** Fine computed on the basis of his salary at the time the decision becomes final and executory.

**Facts:**

*   Complainant (Olandria) filed a complaint against Respondent Sheriff (Fuentes) alleging failure to properly execute a writ of attachment in Civil Case No. CEB-38633.
*   The writ involved the attachment of seven gasoline stations.
*   Respondent failed to maintain control of the attached properties, allowing the plaintiff in the civil case to withdraw items without proper inventory or oversight.
*   The RTC ordered Respondent to make an inventory which Respondent was unable to do, claiming the items were already withdrawn by the plaintiff in the civil case.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The Sheriff had a duty to maintain custody of the attached properties, subject to the court's supervision, and to protect the interests of both parties.
*   The Sheriff was obligated to submit an inventory of the attached properties and updates on those properties awaiting judgment and execution.
*   The sheriff also expected to perform tasks as may be assigned by the judge, such as the directive to submit an inventory to determine the withdrawals made by the plaintiff.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 57 of the Rules of Court:** Provisional Remedy of Preliminary Attachment
*   **Sabijon v. De Juan, 752 Phil. 110 (2015):** Defined Simple Neglect of Duty and cited failure to make periodic reports as a violation.
*   **Mari√±as v. Florendo, 598 Phil. 322 (2009):** Held suspension is not practical when Respondent's work would be left unattended
*   **Atty. Cabigao v. Nery, 719 Phil. 475 (2013):** Held the penalty of fine may be imposed in lieu of suspension from office, when Respondent is actually discharging frontline functions as sheriff
*   **Daplas v. Department of Finance, G.R. No. 221153, April 17, 2017:** Allowed fine in lieu of suspension
*   **The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, Vol. I, p. 196:** Sheriff's general functions and duties

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court found Sheriff Fuentes **GUILTY of Simple Neglect of Duty**.
*   He was fined the equivalent of one (1) month and one (1) day of his salary, computed at the time the decision becomes final, instead of suspension, acknowledging that suspension would negatively impact public service due to his frontline duties and staffing shortages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   While the court imposed a fine instead of suspension, any repetition of similar negligence could result in more severe penalties, potentially including dismissal.
*   Lack of proper inventory and control over attached properties exposes the Sheriff and the court to claims of mismanagement or loss, potentially leading to civil liability.
*   **Ambiguity:** The compromise agreement and its authorization of withdrawals were cited by the Sheriff. However, the Court found that the Sheriff had no authority or discretion to decide whether to comply or not, or to declare whether the order had already become moot.

**Relevance for Lawyer:**

This case illustrates the strict standards and responsibilities placed on sheriffs regarding the execution of writs of attachment. It highlights the importance of meticulous record-keeping, adherence to court orders, and maintaining control over attached properties. The Court's consideration of the "first offense" and frontline duties in mitigating the penalty offers potential arguments in similar administrative cases, but the underlying negligence remains a serious issue. This also highlights the importance of inventory when properties are attached and placed in the custody of the sheriff.
