## Legal Document Summary: *Concerned Citizens v. Ruth Tanglao Suarez-Holguin* (A.M. No. P-18-3843)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution of the Supreme Court in an administrative case.

**Parties:**

*   Complainants: Concerned Citizens (anonymous)
*   Respondent: Ruth Tanglao Suarez-Holguin, Utility Worker 1, Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court, Angeles City, Pampanga

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charges:** The anonymous complaint alleged misconduct, immorality, and violation of OCA Circular 49-2003 based on allegations of neglect of duty, dress code violation, use of official time for personal business, immorality, misuse of Supreme Court stickers, and unauthorized foreign travel.
*   **Dismissal of Most Charges:** The Court dismissed charges of neglect of duty, dress code violation, using official time for personal business, immorality, and misuse of Supreme Court stickers due to lack of *substantial evidence*.  The Court highlighted that conjecture and social media postings without supporting evidence are insufficient.
*   **Violation of OCA Circular 49-2003 (Unauthorized Travel):** The Court found Suarez-Holguin GUILTY of violating Paragraph B (4) of OCA Circular No. 49-2003 ("Guidelines on Requests for Travel Abroad"), which requires prior travel authority.
*   **Findings of Fact:**  Evidence established 13 foreign trips between June 2010 and September 2013, for which she did not secure travel authorities. While leave applications were filed and approved, the travel authorities were still required.  The court did not give weight to the submission of travel authorities issued after the period complained of.
*   **Penalty:**  Considering the multiple violations (13 trips over 3 years) and despite this being the first administrative case against her, the Court imposed a penalty of **SUSPENSION for thirty (30) days without pay**.

**Obligations:**

*   Court personnel must secure travel authority from the OCA before traveling abroad (OCA Circular No. 49-2003).  This duty falls upon all court personnel, including utility workers.

**Liabilities:**

*   Violation of OCA Circular 49-2003 subjects court personnel to disciplinary action.
*   Negligence of the personnel.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Severity of Penalty:** While violation of rules and regulations is usually a light offense (reprimand for the first offense), the court imposed a more significant penalty (suspension) due to the *multiple* instances of the same violation.  This could be argued as disproportionate, considering it was the first offense in an administrative proceeding.
*   **Application of Administrative Rules:** The court applied Section 46 (F) (3), Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, despite prior case law using reprimand as a penalty.
*  **Distinction from Precedent:** The Court distinguished the present case from *OAS, OCA v. Calacal* and *Leave Division, OAS, OCA v. Heusdens* where reprimand or admonishment was given for similar infractions. The court based its decision on the *substantial number* of infractions over the years.
* **Absence of Intent/Culpability:** The respondent's defense of unawareness of the need for a travel authority was dismissed, consistent with the principle that ignorance of the law (or circular) is no excuse.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   OCA Circular No. 49-2003, Paragraph B (4)
*   Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Section 46 (F) (3), Rule 10
*   *OAS, OCA v. Calacal*, 619 Phil. 1 (2009)
*   *Leave Division, OAS, OCA v. Heusdens*, 678 Phil. 328 (2011)
*   *Del Rosario v. Pascua*, 683 Phil. 1 (2012)
*   *Re: Letter of Lucena Ofendo Reyes, A.M. No. 16-12-03-CA and IPI No. 17-248-CA-J, June 6, 2017*
*   *Garong v. Benipayo, 461 Phil. 627, 643 (2003)*
*   Republic Act No. 296, Section 12.

**Conclusion:**

The key risk is the suspension penalty, especially if the respondent can demonstrate mitigating circumstances or a genuine lack of awareness. The argument could be made that a reprimand would have been more appropriate, aligning with prior case law on similar first-time offenses. However, the substantial number of violations weakens this argument.
