## Legal Document Summary: *Rivera v. United Laboratories, Inc.* (G.R. No. 155639)

**Case Overview:**  This case involves a dispute over retirement pay differential. Petitioner Rivera, a retired employee of UNILAB, claims she is entitled to additional retirement benefits based on a later amendment to the retirement plan, considering her continued service after her initial retirement.  The SC reversed the CA decision and denied Rivera's claim.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Retirement Plan:** UNILAB had a retirement plan (Trust Funds A & B). Normal retirement occurred at age 60 or 30 years of service. Rivera initially retired in 1988 after 30 years, receiving retirement benefits.
*   **Continued Employment:** UNILAB allowed Rivera to continue working after her retirement. She was promoted to Assistant Vice-President until the end of 1992. Post 1992, she worked for UNILAB sister companies as a consultant.
*   **Plan Amendment:** In December 1992, UNILAB amended its retirement plan, increasing benefits from one to one-and-a-half months' salary per year of service.
*   **Claim for Differential:** Rivera sought a recomputation of her retirement benefits based on the amended plan and her later salary (1992). UNILAB denied the request.
*   **Legal Action:** Rivera filed a claim with the NLRC for unpaid retirement pay differential.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Rivera claims UNILAB is obligated to pay the retirement benefits differential based on the amended plan and her continuous service until 1992 (or arguably 1994)
*   UNILAB argued that its obligation was satisfied when Rivera was paid her initial retirement benefits per the plan terms in place at her 1988 retirement, and that the statute of limitations had expired.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Statute of Limitations (Art. 291 Labor Code):** UNILAB argued the claim was time-barred. The CA found that Rivera's claim was not prescribed because the three-year prescriptive period was interrupted by her extra-judicial demand, relying on the interpretation of Art. 1155 of the Civil Code as articulated in *De Guzman v. Court of Appeals* and *Manuel L. Quezon University Association v. Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution (MLQU)*. SC upheld the CA's finding on prescription.
*   **Determination of Retirement Date:**  A crucial point of contention was when Rivera definitively "retired" for plan purposes. The CA remanded the case to the LA for determination of retirement benefits. The SC found that despite the LA and CA's actions, the SC could settle the case and settled it.
*   **Consultancy Agreements (ARMCO & Fil-Asia):** Rivera argued these agreements were a "sham" to avoid paying her proper retirement benefits. The SC did not see any indication that the agreements were entered illegitimately and could not pierce the corporate veil to find that the companies were the alter ego of UNILAB, citing *John F. McLeod v. NLRC*.
*   **Applicability of Retirement Pay Law (R.A. 7641):** Rivera argued that she was entitled to benefits under R.A. 7641 if the company plan did not apply. The court rejected the claim, finding she did not qualify under R.A. 7641 as she lacked 5 years of service, which the SC calculated to be from 1988 to 1992 (or from 1989 to 1992).

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 291:** Statute of limitations for money claims.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1155:** Interruption of prescription (extrajudicial demand).
*   **De Guzman v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 132257):**  Case confirming the principle of interruption of prescription via extrajudicial demand in labor cases.
*   **Manuel L. Quezon University Association v. Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution (G.R. No. 82312):** Cited in *De Guzman* regarding interruption of prescription; UNILAB argued this ruling was *obiter dictum*. The SC found whether or not the MLQU decision was obiter dictum to be a non-issue.
*   **John F. McLeod v. NLRC (G.R. No. 146667):** Discusses piercing the corporate veil.
*   **R.A. 7641 (Retirement Pay Law):** Governs retirement benefits in the absence of a company plan.
* **Article 217 of the Labor Code:** Original and exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters to hear and decide to the exclusion of all other courts, quasi-judicial bodies or tribunals

**Legal Analysis & Conclusion:**

The SC ultimately sided with UNILAB, denying Rivera's claim.  The Court held that Rivera was paid retirement benefits commensurate with her 1988 retirement and that she had agreed with the terms of that separation. They also held that the amended plan did not cover her, and R.A. 7641 also could not be used to justify the claim as the time requirements were not met. The SC emphasized the importance of applying the law fairly and according to the relevant rules at the time of retirement. The Court also stated that her services with ARMCO and FIL-ASIA were consultancy services.
