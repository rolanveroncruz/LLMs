**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** October 30, 2009

**Nature of Document:** Resolution approving a Compromise Agreement.

**Parties:**
*   Petitioner: Province of Misamis Oriental, initially represented by Gov. Antonio P. Calingin, subsequently by Gov. Oscar S. Moreno ("Province").
*   Respondent: Grace L. Anayron ("Employee")
*   Respondent: Civil Service Commission (no active participation after Compromise Agreement)

**Background:** The case originated from Civil Service Commission Resolutions Nos. 02-1530 and 03-0431, which ordered the reinstatement and payment of back salaries and benefits to Employee for the period of July 12, 1999 to December 31, 2006. Employee was reinstated on April 17, 2006. The Province appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 77210) and then to the Supreme Court (G.R. No. 183322).

**Key Provisions of Compromise Agreement:**

*   **Settlement Amount:** The Province agrees to pay Employee PHP 1,000,000.00 as full and final settlement for back salaries and other benefits for the period of July 12, 1999 to December 31, 2006.
*   **Payment of Premiums:** The Province agrees to pay GSIS, PAG-IBIG, PHILHEALTH, and SCC premiums of the Employee up to PHP 100,000.00, calculated based on the settlement amount. Any excess is to be borne/paid by the Employee.
*   **Waiver and Release:** In exchange for the settlement amount, Employee waives, renounces, quitclaims, releases, and discharges the Province and its officers from any and all claims arising from the subject cases.
*   **Joint Manifestation:** Parties to file a joint manifestation with the Civil Service Commission and the Supreme Court to inform them of the Compromise Agreement.
*   **Effective Date:** The Compromise Agreement is effective upon approval by the *Sangguniang Panlalawigan* of Misamis Oriental.
*   **Applicable law:** Art. 2028 of the Civil Code

**Obligations:**

*   Province: To pay the settlement amount of PHP 1,000,000.00 and premiums up to PHP 100,000.00.
*   Employee: To accept the settlement amount as full and final satisfaction of all claims related to the back salaries and benefits.
*   Both: To comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement.

**Liabilities Released:** Employee releases the Province from all liabilities arising from the CSC resolutions and related claims.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Excess Premium Payment:** The provision regarding the Employee bearing the excess over PHP 100,000.00 for GSIS, PAG-IBIG, PhilHealth and SCC premiums could be contentious if the actual premiums significantly exceed the allocated amount. Calculation and substantiation of the premiums are critical.
*   **Scope of Release:** The release covers "any and all claims, rights and interests which EMPLOYEE may have, arising from the above-mentioned cases." It is important to ensure this release is comprehensive and unambiguous, preventing future claims related to the underlying dispute.
*   **Approval by *Sangguniang Panlalawigan*:** The agreement requires the Sangguniang Panlalawigan's approval for it to be effective. This was later confirmed in the OSG comments.
*   **Date of Reinstatement:** The date of reinstatement (April 17, 2006) and subsequent payment of salaries based on actual services rendered needed clarification.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Art. 2028 (Definition of Compromise Agreement)

**Case Law:**

*   *Rivero v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 141273, 17 May 2005, 458 SCRA 714, 735. (Validity of compromise agreements)

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court approved and adopted the Compromise Agreement as its decision. The case was closed and terminated. The parties were ordered to comply with its terms. The compromise agreement is valid because it is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public morals and public policy. The key to enforcement will be ensuring that the premium calculations are accurate and that the *Sangguniang Panlalawigan* has duly approved the settlement and appropriated the funds, as was later confirmed by the OSG.
