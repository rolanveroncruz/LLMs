## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bulasag, G.R. No. 172869 (2008)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Donato Bulasag y Arellano alias "Dong"

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Donato Bulasag for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659), sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294(1), RPC). Information alleged that Bulasag, with others, robbed Estelita Bascuguin and killed her in the process (stab wounds and gunshot).
*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Testimony of victim's sister (prior threat by accused), victim's son (positive identification, voice recognition, gun identification), and medico-legal officer (cause of death).
    *   **Defense:** Denial and alibi (attendance at nephew's birthday party and drinking). Wife corroborated alibi.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Positive identification by victim's son was deemed credible, despite the use of a bonnet, due to prior familiarity with the accused's voice, physical features, and the gun used.
    *   Denial and alibi were deemed weak due to lack of credible corroborating evidence (wife was considered a biased witness) and proximity to the crime scene.
    *   The Court cited existing case law on the admissibility of voice recognition as a means of identification, particularly *People v. Prieto* and *People v. Arellano*.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua, moral damages (₱50,000.00), and indemnity (₱50,000.00) to the heirs of the victim.

**Obligations:**

*   Bulasag is obligated to serve his sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Bulasag is obligated to pay moral damages and indemnity to the heirs of Estelita Bascuguin.

**Liabilities:**

*   Bulasag is criminally liable for Robbery with Homicide.
*   Bulasag is civilly liable for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Identification Based on Voice:** Reliance on voice recognition can be problematic, but the court justified it based on the witness's prior familiarity with the accused. Challenges to the credibility and reliability of voice identification may still be possible in other contexts, depending on the specific circumstances.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The case partly relies on circumstantial evidence, such as the identified gun and Bulasag living close to the victim. If the gun was not positively linked to other crimes, this poses a weakness.
*   **Accomplice Testimony (Implied):** While Bulasag was the only one arrested, the Information states the involvement of "John Doe" and "Peter Doe." If these individuals are ever apprehended and provide conflicting accounts, the case against Bulasag could potentially be challenged.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by Republic Act No. 7659) - Defines and penalizes Robbery with Homicide.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Prieto, G.R. No. 141259, July 18, 2003, 406 SCRA 620, 631* - Cited for the principle of identification by the sound of the voice.
*   *People v. Arellano, G.R. No. 131518, October 17, 2000, 343 SCRA 276, 286* - Cited for the principle of identification by familiarity with physical features.
*   General case law regarding the weakness of alibi as a defense, particularly when not physically impossible to be at the crime scene, and the importance of disinterested witnesses.

**Legal Considerations:**

*   The elements of Robbery with Homicide must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (taking of property with intent to gain, use of violence or intimidation, and the commission of homicide by reason or on occasion of the robbery).
*   The credibility of witnesses is crucial, and the court emphasized the lack of improper motive on the part of the prosecution witness.
*   The prosecution must establish a clear link between the robbery and the homicide; the homicide must be a consequence of the robbery.
