**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company vs. Rizalina Raut, Leila Emnace and Gina Capistrano*, G.R. No. 174209, August 25, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the NLRC's dismissal of PLDT's appeal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Illegal dismissal and non-payment of benefits case filed by respondents (Raut, Emnace, Capistrano) against PLDT.
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision:** Reinstatement of respondents as telephone operators and payment of backwages.
*   **Initial Appeal to NLRC:** NLRC affirmed with modifications, ordering payment of overtime pay, nightshift differential pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay.
*   **Initial Appeal to CA:** CA affirmed the NLRC decision, with a minor modification regarding 13th month pay computation. This decision became final and executory on March 26, 2000.
*   **Motion for Execution:** Respondents filed, granted by Labor Arbiter, awarding significantly larger sums due to recomputation and continued refusal to regularize.
*   **Second Appeal to NLRC:** PLDT appealed the Order of Execution, but the NLRC dismissed it because PLDT failed to attach a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping to its Memorandum of Appeal.
*   **Second Appeal to CA:** CA affirmed the NLRC's dismissal.
*   **Present Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the NLRC's dismissal for failure to attach a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping, and the validity of the Labor Arbiter's Order of Execution.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PLDT's Obligation:** To reinstate the respondents to their former positions or equivalent, pay backwages, overtime pay, nightshift differential pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay, as regular employees.  PLDT has the obligation to comply with the Labor Arbiter's Order of Execution.
*   **PLDT's Liability:**  PLDT is liable for the monetary awards to respondents.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** PLDT faces the risk of enforced execution of the Labor Arbiter's Order, potentially leading to asset seizure or other collection actions.
*   **Contempt of Court:** Continued non-compliance could lead to contempt charges.
*   **Additional penalties:** Further delays could result in additional interest and penalties on the judgment amount.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code:** Regarding perfection of appeal and posting of bond.
*   **Rule VI, Section 4 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure:** Requires Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping in appeals.
*   **Accessories Specialist, Inc. v. Alabanza (G.R. No. 168985, July 23, 2008):**  Reinforces that appeal is a statutory privilege and requires strict compliance with rules.
*   **Article 279 and Article 280 of the Labor Code:** Security of Tenure and Regular vs. Casual Employment - used to affirm that the respondents were regular employees.
*   **Banquerigo v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 164633, August 7, 2006):** An order of execution must conform to the decision sought to be enforced.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Computation of Monetary Award:** PLDT disputed that the Labor Arbiter's Order increased the original award. The Supreme Court clarified that the increase reflected the recomputation due until finality and continued refusal to regularize, aligning with the intent of the original ruling.
*   **Respondents' Status as Regular Employees:** PLDT argued that the lower court decisions did not explicitly declare the respondents to be regular employees in their dispositive portion. However, the Supreme Court stated that it was "quite apparent" from the totality of the decisions.

**Legal Analysis & Strategy:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the petitioner failed to perfect the appeal due to the missing certificate of non-forum shopping. The court further found that the labor arbiter's execution order was valid. PLDT's best course of action would be to comply with the labor arbiter's execution order.
