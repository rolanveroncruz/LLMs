**Case Summary: *State Investment Trust, Inc. vs. Carlos Baculo, et al.* (G.R. No. 237934, June 10, 2024)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC decision which rescinded two Contracts to Sell and awarded possession of the properties to SITI.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contracts to Sell (March 25, 1997):** SITI (Seller) and Spouses Baculo (Buyer) for two parcels of land. Stipulated purchase price, downpayment, 36 monthly amortizations at 19% interest per annum. Paragraph 5 granted SITI the right to unilaterally rescind if the vendee fails to make payments, the payments made should be forfeited as liquidated damages.

*   **Restructured Payment Schedule:** SITI granted Spouses Baculo’s request to only pay the interest on the amortizations and extended the payment date to June 25, 2003.

*   **Suspension of Payments:** SITI acceded to Spouses Baculo’s request to suspend payments pending resolution of a reconveyance case, conditioned on automatic resumption upon favorable resolution for SITI.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **SITI:**
    *   Failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 4 of the Maceda Law (R.A. 6552) regarding the notice of cancellation. Specifically, the 60-day grace period was not given, and the notice of cancellation was not notarized.
    *   The 3% per month penalty interest stipulated in the contract was deemed unconscionable, risking its unenforceability.
    *   Raising the defense that R.A. 6552 does not apply to it only in the reply before the Supreme Court.
*   **Spouses Baculo (and Heirs):**
    *   Defaulted on the payment obligations under the Contracts to Sell after having only paid 8 monthly installments for each property, opening them up to claims for rescission.
    *   Possession of the properties hinged on the validity of the Contracts to Sell. If rescission were valid, they would be deemed unlawful detainer.
    *   Failure to pay outstanding balances + interest within 60 days of the Supreme Court’s ruling results in forfeiture of payments and improvements, and eviction.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6552 (Maceda Law):** Critical statute governing the sale of real estate on installment payments. Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 are explicitly referenced as having stipulations that cannot be nullified. Specifically, Section 4 is applicable to the contracts at hand.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1592 (implied reference via MeTC's discussion of rescission), Article 2212 (interest on interest).
*   ***Orbe v. Filinvest Land, Inc.* (817 Phil. 934 (2017)):** Establishes the requirement for a notarial act for a valid notice of cancellation under R.A. 6552.
*   ***Olympia Housing v. Panasiatic Travel Corp.* (443 Phil. 385 (2003)) and *Pagtalunan v. Vda. De Manzano* (559 Phil. 658 (2007)):** Cited as precedent for allowing the buyer a period to pay the outstanding balance and for the consequences of failing to do so.
*   ***Isla v. Estorga* (834 Phil. 884 (2018)):** Differentiates between monetary and compensatory interest.
*   ***Lara's Gifts and Decors, Inc. v. Midtown Industrial Sales* (G.R. No, 225433, September 20, 2022):** Recalibrates the rules on the imposition of interest.
*   ***Macalinao v. Bank of the Philippine Islands* (616 Phil. 60 (2009)):** Held a 3% monthly interest to be iniquitous and unconscionable.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Paragraph 5 of the Contracts to Sell:** While granting SITI the right to unilaterally rescind, it also states "without prejudice to the provisions of the Maceda Law (Republic Act 6552) whenever the same are applicable," creating potential conflict.
*   The interest rate and penalties are contentious due to the high rate and potential for being deemed unconscionable.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modifications. The Contracts to Sell remain valid because SITI failed to validly cancel them under R.A. 6552. The Court ordered the respondents to pay the balance of PHP 7,361,744.87, monetary interest at 19% per annum, penalty interest at 12% per annum (reduced from the contractually stipulated 3% per month), and interest on those interests as per Lara's Gifts, all reckoned from November 16, 2005, to SITI within 60 days from finality. Upon payment, SITI must execute a Deed of Absolute Sale. Failure to pay within 60 days results in forfeiture of payments, improvements, and immediate eviction.
