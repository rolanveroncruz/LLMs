*   **Specific Instances:** Numerous memoranda (18 listed) detailing failures to serve notices, submit returns, attend meetings, and comply with office rules. These memoranda specify case numbers and dates of infractions.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Voluminous workload, difficulty in locating addresses, heavy traffic, and allegations of complainant's desire to force his resignation. He cited *Philippine Racing Club, Inc. v. Bonifacio, et al.* (109 Phil. 233, 241 (1960)), claiming quasi-judicial immunity.

**Ruling:**

*   **Penalty:** Suspension for one (1) year without pay, with a stern warning.
*   The Court rejected the respondent's defenses as "flimsy excuses" and distinguished the *Philippine Racing Club* case.
*   The court emphasized that "public office is a public trust" (Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution) and cited *Geolingo v. Albayda, A.M. No. P-02-1660, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 32, 38*, and *Fajardo v. Sheriff Quitalig, 448 Phil. 29, 31 (2003)* highlighting duty to maintain public trust.
*   The Court referenced *Imperial v. Santiago, Jr., 446 Phil. 104, 119 (2003)* concerning diligence and suspicion-free performance of duties by deputy sheriffs.
*   Cited also *Lopena v. Saloma, A.M. No. P-06-2280, January 31, 2008*, underscoring strict adherence to office hours.

*   **Section 9 Rule XVII of the Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292 and Other Pertinent Civil Service Laws:** Prohibits offsetting tardiness.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   The respondent's claim of a quasi-judicial role and immunity was rejected.
*   The case highlights the importance of strict compliance with court procedures and deadlines by court personnel, particularly sheriffs.
*   Reliance solely on workload volume as a defense may not be sufficient.
*   The consistent and documented nature of the infractions weighed heavily against the respondent.
*   The *Philippine Racing Club, Inc. v. Bonifacio, et al.* defense was found to be inapplicable.
*   The defense that the complainant was trying to force his resignation was not given weight in the judgement.
