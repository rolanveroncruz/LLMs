**Case:** *Sps. Lita De Leon and Felix Rio Tarrosa vs. Anita B. De Leon, Danilo B. De Leon, and Vilma B. De Leon*, G.R. No. 185063, July 23, 2009

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute over a parcel of land purchased via a Conditional Contract to Sell by Bonifacio De Leon before his marriage to Anita De Leon, but with the final deed of sale executed and title issued during their marriage. Bonifacio subsequently sold the land to his sister, Lita Tarrosa, and her husband, Felix, without Anita's consent. Anita, joined by her children, filed a reconveyance suit after Bonifacio's death, arguing the sale was void.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conditional Contract to Sell:** Bonifacio entered into a Conditional Contract to Sell with PHHC before marriage.
*   **Final Deed of Sale:** The Final Deed of Sale was executed during Bonifacio's marriage to Anita.
*   **Deed of Sale (Bonifacio to Tarrosa):** Executed during the marriage without Anita's consent (violates Article 166 of the 1950 Civil Code).
*   **Article 160, 1950 Civil Code:** Establishes the presumption that property acquired during marriage is conjugal.
*   **Joint Stipulation of Facts:** Parties agreed on key dates and the validity of the Deed of Sale, but not on the effect of the lack of Anita's consent.

**Obligations:**

*   **Bonifacio:** Obligation to obtain Anita's consent for the sale of conjugal property.
*   **Tarrosas:** Obligation to ensure the validity of the sale, including obtaining spousal consent.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tarrosas:** The court ruled that the Deed of Sale between Bonifacio and the Tarossas is void due to the lack of Anita's consent, and ordered the cancellation of the Tarrosas' title (TCT No. N-173911) and restoration of the original title (TCT No. 173667) in Bonifacio's name.
*   **Bonifacio (Estate):** The share of Bonifacio after the liquidation of the partnership is liable to reimburse the amount of PhP 19,000 paid by the Tarrosas to prevent unjust enrichment.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Marriage:** The validity of the marriage between Bonifacio and Anita was stipulated.
*   **Lack of Spousal Consent:** The Deed of Sale lacked the wife's consent, rendering it void under Art. 166 of the 1950 Civil Code.
*   **Conjugal Nature of Property:** The Court held that the property was conjugal because title was transferred during the marriage, invoking the presumption under Art. 160 of the Civil Code. The Tarrosas failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the property was acquired solely through the efforts of Bonifacio.
*   **Liquidation of Conjugal Partnership:** The ruling that the sale of one-half of the conjugal property without liquidation is void.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Lorenzo v. Nicolas:** Distinguished as involving friar lands, governed by specific legislation (Act No. 1120), unlike the present case.
*   **Alvarez v. Espiritu:** Distinguished for the same reason as Lorenzo.
*   **Tan v. Court of Appeals:** Used to support the presumption that property acquired during marriage is conjugal, even without proof of partnership funds.
*   **Nicolas v. Court of Appeals, Garcia v. Court of Appeals, Tolentino v. Cardenas:** cited to reinforce the legal principle that the sale of conjugal property by the husband without the wife's consent is void.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 160, Civil Code (1950):** Presumption of conjugality.
*   **Article 166, Civil Code (1950):** Requires wife's consent for alienation or encumbrance of conjugal real property by the husband.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Valid and Genuine" stipulation**: While the Tarrossas stipulated that the Deed of Sale was valid and genuine, the Court did not give significant weight to this, because it was qualified by the explicit acknowledgement that Anita was not a signatory and because the validity of a contract is ultimately a legal conclusion for the court to determine.
