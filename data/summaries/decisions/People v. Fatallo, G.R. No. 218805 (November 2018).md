Okay, here's a summary of the legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alvin Fatallo y Alecarte,* G.R. No. 218805, November 7, 2018 (842 Phil. 1060)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for violations of Sections 5 (illegal sale of dangerous drugs) and 15 (illegal use of dangerous drugs), Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Holding:**  Conviction reversed and accused acquitted due to the prosecution's failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs, resulting in a compromised corpus delicti.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 Non-Compliance:** The Court found that the buy-bust team failed to adhere to the mandatory requirements of Section 21 regarding the inventory and photographing of the seized drugs immediately after seizure, and the presence of required witnesses (accused/representative, elected public official, media representative, and DOJ representative) during the process. None of the three required witnesses was present at the time of seizure and confiscation.

    *   **Case Law:** The Court cites *People v. Tomawis* (G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018) extensively, emphasizing the essential purpose of the required witnesses to protect against planting, contamination, or loss of evidence and that the witness must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly at the time of the warrantless arrest. The Court also emphasizes that the saving clause of the IRR only applies when the prosecution acknowledges the lapses and provides justifiable explanation, referencing *People v. Reyes* (797 Phil. 671, 2016). The failure to comply with Section 21 is considered a matter of substantive law, not a minor procedural technicality.

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The Court identified significant gaps in the chain of custody, undermining the integrity of the evidence:

    *   **Marking:** Drugs were not marked immediately at the place of seizure.
    *   **Missing Witness:** Vital witness (SPO2 Joloyohoy) was not presented in court and there was no evidence on how confiscated drugs passed from the confidential informant to SPO2 Joloyohoy,
    *   **Inconsistencies in Delivery:** Conflicting testimony/records regarding who delivered the drugs to the crime laboratory (SPO2 Joloyohoy vs. PO1 Monton).
    *   **Forensic Chemist Testimony:** Limited detail in the testimony of PSI Gucor regarding the handling of the specimens.
    *   **Case Law:** The Court notes that the starting point of the custodial link is the marking of the seized drug immediately after seizure, citing *People v. Dahil* (750 Phil. 212, 2015).

*   **Presumption of Innocence vs. Presumption of Regularity:** The Court held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty cannot overcome the presumption of innocence, especially in light of the procedural lapses.
    *   **Case Law:** *People v. Enriquez* (718 Phil. 352, 2013) is cited regarding justifiable divergences from the prescribed procedure.

*   **Violation of Section 15 (Illegal Use) Charge:** The Court found that the positive drug test results were inadmissible as "fruit of the poisonous tree" because the initial arrest was illegal due to the violation of Section 21. Therefore, the test conducted on him has no leg to stand on.
    *   **Case Law:** *People v. Alicando* (321 Phil. 656 (1995)) is referenced regarding the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.

*   **PNP Drug Enforcement Manual:** The Court notes that the buy-bust team failed to follow relevant internal police procedures (1999 Philippine National Police Drug Enforcement Manual (PNPDEM)), casting further doubt on the operation's regularity. Reference to *People v. Zheng Bai Hui* (393 Phil. 68, 133 (2000))

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Confidential Informant:** The decision acknowledges the difficulty in presenting confidential informants but emphasizes the need for alternative means of establishing the chain of custody when the informant is not presented as a witness.
*   **Reliance on Procedural Technicalities:** The decision reinforces the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and clarifies that it is not a mere procedural technicality.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Strict adherence to Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is mandatory. Law enforcement agents must ensure proper documentation, marking, and presence of required witnesses. Prosecutors bear the burden of proving compliance and justifying any deviations.
*   **Prosecutors:** Prosecutors must diligently prove compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of strict adherence to the procedural requirements outlined in R.A. 9165, particularly Section 21, in drug cases.  Failure to comply can lead to the suppression of evidence and acquittal of the accused, regardless of the actual commission of the crime. The decision highlights the need for thorough documentation, unbroken chain of custody, and proper justification for any deviations from the prescribed procedures.
