**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cruz*, G.R. No. 185381 (2009)**

This is a criminal appeal affirming the lower courts' conviction of Danilo Cruz for violations of Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Sec. 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** Cruz was convicted of selling 0.05 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) to a poseur buyer.
*   **Sec. 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** Cruz was also convicted for possessing 0.04 gram of shabu found on his person during the buy-bust operation.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:**  The case revolves around a buy-bust operation conducted based on information received from an informant. The prosecution presented evidence that a sale occurred and the defendant possessed additional drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody:**  The court held that the chain of custody of the seized drugs was adequately established despite the appellant's claims, satisfying the standard set in *Mallillin v. People*.
*   **Section 21, IRR RA 9165:** The Court notes that the requirements of Section 21 need not be followed with pedantic rigor and that substantial compliance is sufficient.

**Obligations:**

*   The prosecution is obligated to prove the elements of the crimes beyond reasonable doubt.
*   Law enforcement has an obligation to maintain the integrity and evidentiary value of seized drugs to avoid compromising the chain of custody.

**Liabilities:**

*   Cruz is liable for life imprisonment and a fine of PhP 500,000 for the sale conviction.
*   Cruz is further liable for 12 years and 1 day imprisonment and a fine of PhP 300,000 for the possession conviction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Arguments (Rejected):**
    *   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense argued that inconsistencies in prosecution witnesses' testimonies warranted reasonable doubt.  The court found these inconsistencies minor and the testimonies consistent on material points.
    *   **Lack of Prior Surveillance:** The defense claimed the absence of prior surveillance invalidated the buy-bust. The court held prior surveillance is not a prerequisite, especially with an informant.
    *   **Non-compliance with Sec. 21, IRR RA 9165:**  The defense argued that the lack of inventory, photograph, and presence of required representatives at the time of seizure violated RA 9165.  The court applied the "substantial compliance" exception, citing that integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved, relying on *People v. Naquita* and *People v. Del Monte*.
    *   **Denial and Frame-up:** The court dismissed Cruz's defense of denial and frame-up as inherently weak.
*   **Statutory References:** RA 9165, Sec. 5 and 11.

**Case Law:**

*   **Buy-bust validity:** *People v. Herrera* and *People v. Tadepa* are cited to support the validity of buy-bust operations as a form of entrapment.
*   **Chain of custody:** *Mallillin v. People* is cited regarding the requirement that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.
*   **Prior surveillance:** *Cruz v. People* and *People v. Eugenio* are cited against the argument that a prior surveillance is needed for a valid buy-bust operation.
*   **"Substantial compliance" with Sec. 21, IRR RA 9165:** *People v. Naquita* and *People v. Del Monte* are cited to support the idea that strict adherence to the procedural requirements of Section 21 is not required as long as integrity of the seized items is properly preserved.
* **Animus possidendi**: *U.S. v. Bandoc* is cited for the principle that the finding of a dangerous drug within the premises of the accused's house is prima facie evidence of knowledge or animus possidendi.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the application of the "substantial compliance" exception to Section 21 of the Implementing Rules of RA 9165. The defense likely argued that the lack of strict adherence to the inventory and witnessing requirements created doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence. The court's affirmation indicates a tolerance for less-than-perfect compliance where the chain of custody can still be reasonably established.
