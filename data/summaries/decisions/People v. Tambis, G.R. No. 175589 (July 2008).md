**Case Summary: People v. Tambis, G.R. No. 175589 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Cerilo Tambis (Appellant) was charged with Murder under the Revised Penal Code for the fatal stabbing of Gaudioso Moral, Jr. (Victim) with *treachery* and *evident premeditation*.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** Appellant stabbed the unarmed Victim while the Victim was drinking with others.
*   **Appellant's Defense:** Self-defense, claiming the Victim attacked him with a knife.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted Appellant of Murder (rejecting self-defense). RTC found treachery present, but not evident premeditation. Sentence: *Reclusion Perpetua*, plus damages.
*   **Appellant's Argument on Appeal:** Asserts the RTC erred in finding treachery existed. Argues his warning "Walang kikilos!" negated treachery.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA Decision.

**Key Legal Issues:**

*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The central issue is whether the stabbing was qualified by treachery. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings that treachery existed, even with the utterance "Walang kikilos!," as the attack was sudden, depriving the Victim of any real opportunity to defend himself. The Court cited *People v. Gutierrez, 429 Phil. 124, 137 (2002)*.
*   **Self-Defense:** Implicitly rejected by the trial court and affirmed by the appellate courts due to lack of credible evidence and the prosecution's strong evidence of unprovoked attack.
*   **Computation of Damages:** The Supreme Court, *motu proprio* (People v. Artellero, 395 Phil. 876, 889 (2000)), reviewed the civil aspect of the case.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Appellant remains convicted of Murder, carrying the penalty of *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Appellant is liable for the following damages:
    *   **Actual Damages:** Increased to P26,300.45 to reflect the documented expenses for hospitalization, wake, and funeral.
    *   **Moral Damages:** Maintained at P30,000.00.
    *   **Indemnity for Death:** Maintained at P75,000.00.
    *   **Compensatory Damages (Loss of Earning Capacity):** Reduced to P1,269,047.30. The SC used the formula: `Net Earning Capacity = [2/3 x (80 - Age at Death) x (Gross Annual Income - 50% of GAI)]`. *People v. Catbagan, 467 Phil. 1044, 1087 (2004)*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinges on the factual interpretation of the events. The SC sided with the prosecution based on evidence presented.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:**  No mitigating circumstances were successfully invoked by the appellant.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC) - Murder (Art. 248)
