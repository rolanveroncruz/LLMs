## Legal Document Summary: *Montebon v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 180568 (2009)

**Type:** Supreme Court Resolution denying Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Core Issue:** Validity of an Alias Writ of Execution Pending Appeal based on a corrected address in the dispositive portion of the MeTC's ejectment decision.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Factual Background:** Landlord (Lopez) sued Tenant (Montebon) for ejectment due to non-payment of rent. MeTC ruled for Lopez but dispositive portion incorrectly stated the property address as "1457 Paz Street" instead of "1459 Paz Street." Montebon appealed, and Lopez sought execution pending appeal (no supersedeas bond filed). RTC granted the motion and subsequently corrected the address in the Alias Writ of Execution.
*   **Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, affirming the RTC's authority to correct the erroneous address in the writ of execution pending appeal.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **Clerical Error:** The incorrect address was deemed a clerical error, not a fundamental defect invalidating the judgment.
    *   **RTC Authority:** The RTC, having appellate jurisdiction, had the authority to amend its processes to conform to law and justice, per Rule 135, Section 5(g) of the Rules of Court.
    *   **Reference to Decision Body:** Clerical errors in the dispositive portion can be rectified by referring to the body of the decision and prior pleadings, where the correct address was evident.  Cited *Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 61250 (1991) for this principle.
    *   **Abuse of Process:** The Court suggested Montebon's appeal was designed to unjustly delay execution.

**Obligations:**

*   Montebon is obligated to vacate the premises at 1459 Paz Street, Paco, Manila, and surrender possession to Lopez.
*   Montebon is obligated to pay back rentals, current rentals, attorney's fees, and costs of the suit as ordered in the MeTC decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Montebon is liable for the aforementioned monetary judgments.
*   Potential liability for abuse of process if further delaying tactics are employed.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   While deemed a clerical error, continued challenges by Montebon could further delay execution.
*   No indication if the RTC actually reviewed the pleadings.
*   The fact that an employee, and not the plaintiff lived at 1457 Paz, may make the clerical error argument less strong.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 135, Section 5(g) of the Rules of Court (Inherent power of courts).
*   *Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 61250 (1991) (Rectification of clerical errors in judgment).

**Conclusion:**

The case confirms the RTC's power to correct clerical errors in judgments during execution pending appeal, especially when the error is clear from the context of the decision and pleadings. The key risk is potential for continued delays by Montebon in the execution process. Further legal action by the plaintiff's counsel may be needed.
