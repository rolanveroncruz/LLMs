## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Arcilla v. Teodoro*, G.R. No. 162886, August 11, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision, which in turn affirmed the Municipal Trial Court's (MTC) decision granting respondent Teodoro's application for land registration.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Land Registration Application:** Respondent filed an application for land registration based on a Deed of Sale from her father, who allegedly acquired the land through extrajudicial settlement.
*   **Opposition by Heirs of Arcilla:** Petitioners opposed, claiming ownership through inheritance from their parents, alleging prior purchase by their father (Vicente Arcilla) and continuous possession since 1906. They presented tax declarations.
*   **Forum Shopping Certificate:** Issue arose regarding the belated filing of the certificate against forum shopping required by SC Administrative Circular No. 04-94 and Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court by the Respondent.
*   **Evidence of Ownership:** The core dispute revolves around conflicting claims of ownership and the probative value of presented evidence: deed of sale versus tax declarations, extrajudicial settlement vs prior purchase.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent Teodoro:** Had the burden to prove ownership to successfully register the land.
*   **Petitioners Heirs of Arcilla:** Had the burden to prove their claim of ownership in order to overturn the MTC, RTC, and CA decisions.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Belated Filing of Forum Shopping Certificate:** This was the central legal argument of the Petitioners to dismiss the application, but the Supreme Court did not see the belated filing as a risk.
*   **Validity of Affidavit of Quitclaim:** Petitioners challenged the validity of the Affidavit of Quitclaim, alleging irregularities and lack of proper acknowledgment.
*   **Conflicting Evidence of Ownership:** The weight and admissibility of tax declarations versus the deed of sale and extrajudicial settlement, specifically regarding the chain of title.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding certification against forum shopping.
*   **SC Administrative Circular No. 04-94:** Requirement for the Certification of Non-Forum Shopping.
*   **Section 24, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Pertaining to Proof of official record
*   **Sec. 19, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Classes of documents.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The effect of the affidavit of quitclaim signed with defects**, and the implication if not all parties are bound by the settlement agreement.

**Summary of Holding:**

The Supreme Court DENIED the petition and AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals' decision.

*   The Court held that the belated filing of the sworn certification of non-forum shopping was substantial compliance with SC Administrative Circular No. 04-94.
*   The Court held the Affidavit of Quitclaim, Deed of Sale in favor of the Respondent, and the Extrajudicial Settlement in favor of the Respondent's predecessor-in-interest established the ownership in favor of the Respondent.
*   The Court ruled the certification of non-forum shopping executed in a foreign country is not covered by Section 24, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.

**Overall Assessment:**
The Court applied principles of substantial justice over strict procedural compliance regarding the forum shopping certificate. Ultimately, the Court based its decision on the strength of respondent's evidence (Deed of Sale, extrajudicial settlement), finding petitioners' evidence (tax declarations) insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity afforded to notarized documents. A critical point is that the facts were reviewed at the appellate level, making the Supreme Court very hesitant to overturn the conclusions.
