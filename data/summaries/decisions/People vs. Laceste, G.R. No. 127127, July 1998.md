## Legal Document Summary: People v. Laceste, G.R. No. 127127 (1998)

This is an automatic review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Eufrocenio Laceste of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 7659, and sentencing him to death. The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the conviction but modifies the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* and adjusts the damages awarded.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Murder under Art. 248 of the RPC, as amended, for the stabbing death of Rufo Narvas, Sr., allegedly committed with evident premeditation, treachery, and taking advantage of superior strength.
*   **Accused:** Eufrocenio Laceste, Cipriano Laceste, Rizalino Laceste, Eddie Bauson, Arthur Bauson, Bonifacio Soriano, and John Doe. Eufrocenio and Cipriano were tried jointly.
*   **Elements of Murder:** Unlawful killing, intent to kill, qualifying circumstance of treachery.
*   **Defense:** Alibi, denial of involvement, claim that Eddie Bauson stabbed the victim in self-defense.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Convicted Eufrocenio Laceste of murder, acquitted Cipriano Laceste, and initially sentenced Eufrocenio to death.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Eufrocenio Laceste:** To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Eufrocenio Laceste:** To pay civil indemnity and actual damages to the heirs of Rufo Narvas, Sr.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Eufrocenio Laceste is criminally liable as the principal for the crime of murder.
*   **Civil Liability:** Eufrocenio Laceste is civilly liable to the heirs of the victim for:
    *   P50,000 as civil indemnity (Art. 2206, Civil Code).
    *   P60,000 as actual damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The defense challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses, alleging improbability and inconsistencies. The SC affirmed the RTC's finding that the prosecution witnesses were more credible, citing their deportment and the absence of evidence of bias. *Rationale: Appellate courts give deference to trial court credibility assessments.*
*   **Treachery (Art. 14, par. 16, RPC):** The defense argued that the single stab wound and the facing positions of the victim and assailant negated treachery. The SC upheld the RTC's finding of treachery based on the suddenness of the attack on an unsuspecting, unarmed victim being held by the co-accused, ensuring the execution of the crime without risk to the assailants. *Significant as it elevates the crime to murder.*
*   **Flight:** The SC considers the unexplained flight of Eufrocenio and Cipriano Laceste as evidence of guilt, relying on *U.S. v. Sarikala, 37 Phil. 486 (1918).* *Flight alone is not conclusive, but considered alongside other evidence.*
*   **Damages:** The trial court's initial award of "P100,000 as actual, moral, compensatory, and other consequential damages" was found to be incorrect.  The SC clarified the different types of damages and specified the separate amounts for civil indemnity and actual damages. *The SC underscored the need for specificity in awarding damages*
