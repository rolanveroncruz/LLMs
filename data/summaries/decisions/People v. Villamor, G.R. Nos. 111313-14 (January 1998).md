## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Villamor*, G.R. Nos. 111313-14 (1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Surigao City convicting Appellant Julie Villamor of two counts of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellant convicted of two counts of murder for the deaths of Benigno Tenajeros and Lito Edo.

*   **Witness Testimony:** The Court upheld the trial court's reliance on the eyewitness testimony of Eduardo Escalante, despite a delay in reporting, citing *People v. Magana* (259 SCRA 380, 1996) given the witness's fear of reprisal. The Court dismissed arguments of Eduardo being a polluted source and the events being contrary to human experience.

*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** Treachery (*Alevosia*) was established based on the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, citing *People v. Sol* (G.R. No. 118504, May 7, 1997), ensuring the victims had no opportunity to defend themselves. Abuse of superior strength was absorbed by treachery.

*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua for each count of murder.

*   **Damages (Modified on Appeal):**
    *   Civil indemnity increased to P50,000 for each victim, citing *People v. Caballes*, G.R. Nos. 102723-24 (1997).
    *   Award for loss of earning capacity calculated using the formula 2/3 x (80-age) x (annual net income).
        *   Benigno Tenajeros: P688,000
        *   Lito Edo: P69,600.
    *   Awards for Moral damages and funeral expenses were deleted due to lack of factual basis.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to pay the specified amounts of civil indemnity and loss of earning capacity to the heirs of each victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant found criminally liable for two counts of murder.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual findings of Trial Court upheld:** The Court reiterates the principle that trial courts' assessments of witnesses' credibility are accorded great respect unless there is arbitrariness or misappreciation of facts.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** While delay in reporting can be excused by justifiable reasons, it raises questions about the credibility of the witness and should be explored during trial.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Applicable laws governing damages and computation of loss of earning capacity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial award of damages lacked supporting evidence. This was addressed in the Supreme Court's modification, but highlights the importance of proving actual damages with receipts and other credible evidence.
