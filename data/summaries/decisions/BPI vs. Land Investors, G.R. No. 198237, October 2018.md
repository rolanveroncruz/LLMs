## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Land Investors and Developers Corporation (G.R. No. 198237)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 regarding the CA decision finding BPI liable for breach of fiduciary duty to its depositor, Land Investors and Developers Corporation (LIDC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** LIDC maintained accounts with FEBTC (later merged with BPI). LIDC authorized "any two" of Fariñas, Dela Peña, and Collas as signatories. Dela Peña was later convicted of estafa and dismissed. LIDC claimed Dela Peña, through negligence or conspiracy with BPI, unlawfully withdrew P3,652,095.01 based on his sole signature or forged co-signatory signatures.
*   **Procedural History:** RTC granted BPI's demurrer to evidence, finding no proof of conspiracy or gross negligence. CA reversed, finding BPI negligent for allowing unauthorized withdrawals and holding BPI liable for breach of fiduciary duty.
*   **CA Findings:** CA found that BPI allowed withdrawals with only Dela Peña's signature, violating the "any two" requirement based on Exhibits "D" to "D-2", "F" to "F-6" and "G" to "G-1". CA further found that Exhibits "H" to "H-28" and "I" to "I-80" contained forged signatures of Fariñas, supported by expert testimony and comparison of signatures.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision finding BPI liable for breach of contract but modified the CA decision on solidarily liable with Dela Pena and the reckoning period of the interest imposed.
*   **Basis of Liability:** BPI's liability stems from *breach of contract (loan/mutuum)* under Article 1980 of the Civil Code, for failing to adhere to the agreed-upon signatory requirements. Dela Pena's liability stems from the commission of the crime of estafa.

**Obligations:**

*   **BPI:** Obligated to adhere to the "any two" signatory requirement for LIDC's accounts. Had a contractual duty of care to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.
*   **LIDC:** Obligation to properly supervise its authorized signatories.

**Liabilities:**

*   **BPI:** Held liable for actual damages of P3,652,095.01 with interest. Initially at 12% per annum from September 16, 2002 (date of judicial demand) until June 30, 2013, and then at 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until fully satisfied. Also liable for P100,000.00 attorney's fees.
*   **Dela Peña:** Liable for the crime of Estafa

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prescription:** BPI initially argued prescription on claims prior to September 30, 1998, but this was rejected.
*   **Authentication of Documents:** BPI challenged the admissibility of checks and withdrawal slips. The court found that BPI's admission of these documents and stipulation to their genuineness during the preliminary conference waived the need for authentication. *Patula v. People, 685 Phil. 376, 397-398 (2012)*.
*   **Proof of Forgery:** BPI argued insufficient proof of forgery, citing *Sps. Salonga v. Sps. Concepcion, 507 Phil. 287 (2005)*. This argument was rejected as there was additional corroborating evidence of the testimonies made by Farinas and a handwriting expert. *Equitable Cardnetwork, Inc. v. Capistrano, 681 Phil. 462, 475 (2012)*
*   **Solidary Liability:** The CA initially held BPI and Dela Peña solidarily liable, but the Supreme Court reversed this, recognizing distinct sources of liability (breach of contract vs. estafa).
*   **Interest Rate:** Computation of interest needed modification based on *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al., 716 Phil. 267 (2013)*, specifically regarding the prospective application of the new legal interest rate.
