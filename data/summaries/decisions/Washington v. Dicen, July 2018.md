**Case Summary: _Washington v. Dicen_, A.C. No. 12137 (July 9, 2018)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Samuel D. Dicen for violation of Rule 8.01, Canon 8 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) regarding the use of abusive, offensive, or improper language in pleadings.

**Key Facts:**

*   Complainant Pheninah D.F. Washington filed a complaint against Atty. Dicen, alleging unethical practice stemming from her arrest for trespassing on a property where her niece (Atty. Dicen's relative) resided. Complainant claimed ownership of the property.
*   Atty. Dicen denied ordering the arrest and argued that complainant was caught *in flagrante delicto* committing acts of coercion.
*   The IBP-CBD found no merit in the unethical practice allegations, but recommended admonishment for Atty. Dicen's intemperate language in his Manifestation and Position Paper filed during the disciplinary proceedings.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Rule 8.01, Canon 8, CPR:**  A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper.  This reinforces the duty of lawyers to be gracious, courteous, and dignified in their pleadings and arguments.
*   Lawyers have a duty to maintain the dignity of the legal profession and to use language that is respectful and befitting of that dignity. _(Atty. Torres v. Atty. Javier, 501 Phil. 397, 408-409 (2005))_

**Liabilities/Findings:**

*   Atty. Dicen found GUILTY of violating Rule 8.01, Canon 8 of the CPR.
*   Atty. Dicen was ADMONISHED and STERNLY WARNED against future use of improper language.
*   The Court held that Atty. Dicen used derogatory and offensive language in his pleadings, including calling the complainant a "lunatic," accusing her of a "crazy quest for revenge," and implying adultery.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Abusive" Language:** While the rule is clear, the determination of what constitutes "abusive," "offensive," or "improper" language is somewhat subjective and depends on the specific context.  _Washington v. Dicen_ provides a specific example of language that the Court deemed inappropriate.
*   **Impact on Zealous Advocacy:** There could be a chilling effect on zealous advocacy if lawyers fear disciplinary action for using strong language, even if their arguments are valid. However, the Court emphasizes that forceful arguments can be made respectfully.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 8, Rule 8.01**
*   **_Atty. Barandon, Jr. v. Atty. Ferrer, Sr._, 630 Phil. 524 (2010):** Reinforces the privilege of legal practice and the standards of legal proficiency and morality.
*   **_Atty. Torres v. Atty. Javier_ 501 Phil. 397 (2005):** States a lawyer's arguments must be of words as may be properly addressed by one gentleman to another.
*   **_Spouses Nuezca v. Atty. Villagarcia_ 792 Phil. 535 (2016):** States a lawyer's language may be forceful and emphatic, it should always be dignified and respectful, befitting the dignity of the legal profession.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary point of contention is the interpretation of Rule 8.01 and whether Atty. Dicen's specific language crossed the line into being abusive or offensive, given the contentious nature of the underlying dispute.

**Conclusion:**

_Washington v. Dicen_ serves as a reminder to lawyers to maintain professionalism and civility in their pleadings, even when dealing with difficult or adversarial situations. The case reinforces the importance of Rule 8.01, Canon 8 of the CPR and provides specific examples of language that the Court considers to be inappropriate. The disciplinary action taken against Atty. Dicen underscores the potential consequences of failing to adhere to these ethical standards.
