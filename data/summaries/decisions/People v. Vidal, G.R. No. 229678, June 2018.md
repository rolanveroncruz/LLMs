Here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Herminio Vidal, Jr., et al.*, G.R. No. 229678 (2018)

**Summary:** This is an appeal from a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of accused-appellants Vidal and David for two counts of the complex crime of Direct Assault with Murder (RPC Art. 148 & 248) and one count of Direct Assault with Attempted Murder (RPC Art. 148 & 248).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Facts:** The case stems from the fatal shooting of Mayor Arcillas and PO2 Rivera, and the wounding of PO3 Almendras, inside the Sta. Rosa City Hall.
*   **Positive Identification:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA and RTC's finding of positive identification of Vidal and David by eyewitness PO3 Almendras. The SC held that the witnessâ€™s testimony was credible, reliable, and not tainted by improper motive, and that the alleged delay in identification was reasonable under the circumstances. *Vergara v. People, 425 Phil. 124, 133 (2002)*
*   **Direct Assault with Murder:** The Court agreed that the crime was Direct Assault because the victims were a person in authority (Mayor Arcillas) and agents of a person in authority (PO2 Rivera and PO3 Almendras) performing official duties (RPC Art. 148). The victims were attacked while performing their duties. This assault resulted in the death of the mayor and one police officer, qualifying as murder due to treachery (RPC Art. 248). *People v. Abalos, 328 Phil. 24, 36 (1996)*
*   **Treachery:** The Court found that the attack was sudden and unexpected, leaving the victims unable to defend themselves (RPC Art. 14). *People v. Villarico, Sr., et al., 662 Phil. 399, 422 (2011).*
*   **Conspiracy:** The coordinated actions of the appellants indicated a conspiracy, making them all liable as co-principals (RPC Art. 8). *People v. De la Rosa, Jr., 395 Phil. 643, 659 (2000).*
*   **Direct Assault with Attempted Murder:** The CA correctly modified the RTC decision, downgrading the charge related to PO3 Almendras's injuries from Frustrated Murder to Attempted Murder because the prosecution failed to prove that the wounds were fatal without medical intervention. *Epifanio v. People, 552 Phil. 620, 631 (2007).*
*   **Alibi and Denial:** The defenses of alibi and denial were rejected due to the positive identification and the failure to prove the impossibility of the appellants being at the crime scene. *People v. Calonge, 637 Phil. 435, 455 (2010).*
*   **Penalties:** The Supreme Court imposed *Reclusion Perpetua* without eligibility for parole for Direct Assault with Murder (Criminal Case Nos. 17646-B and 17647-B), and *Prision Correccional* for Direct Assault with Attempted Murder (Criminal Case No. 17648-B), and modified damage awards in line with *People v. Jugueta*.
*   **Damages Awarded:** Increased civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P100,000 each for the murder cases.  Temperate damages were also increased.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Issues:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:**  The primary risk revolved around the reliability of PO3 Almendras's identification, considering the circumstances of the shooting and the time elapsed before identification. However, the court deemed the identification reliable based on a lack of improper motive and consistency in the testimony.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** While the prosecution alleged evident premeditation, the SC ultimately agreed with the CA in finding that the element had not been adequately proven.
