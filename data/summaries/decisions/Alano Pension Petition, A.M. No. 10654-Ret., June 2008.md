## Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Judge Antonio S. Alano (Ret.)*

**Case:** A.M. No. 10654-Ret., June 27, 2008 (578 Phil. 577)

**Issue:** Whether Judge Alano can credit his Sangguniang Bayan service to meet the 20-year government service requirement for lifetime pension under R.A. No. 910.

**Holding:** Yes. Judge Alano's Sangguniang Bayan service is creditable, entitling him to an additional lump sum payment and a potential lifetime pension.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 910, Sec. 1 (as amended):** Governs the retirement benefits of justices and judges. Requires 20 years of government service (not exclusively judicial for retirees over 70, or those retiring due to incapacity). For those retiring at 60, the last five years must be judicial.
*   **R.A. No. 910, Sec. 3:** Provides for disability retirement with a 10-year lump sum gratuity but historically, no lifetime annuity. However, later jurisprudence allowed lifetime pension benefits for disability retirement beneficiaries if they would have also qualified under Sec. 1.
*   **Court's Obligation:** To liberally construe retirement laws in favor of the retiree.

**Key Facts & Reasoning:**

*   Judge Alano retired due to disability with approximately 17 years of credited service.
*   He sought to include 4+ years of Sangguniang Bayan service to reach the 20-year threshold under R.A. No. 910.
*   The Court initially denied the motion but reconsidered based on submitted documentation despite records of his service being destroyed.
*   The Court referenced *In Re: Application for Retirement Under R.A. No. 910 of Associate Justice Ramon B. Britanico of the Intermediate Appellate Court* (A.M. No. 6484-Ret., May 15, 1989, 173 SCRA 421, 426) to clarify the different categories of retirees.
*   The Court relied on *Re: Ruperto G. Martin* (A.M. No. 747-RET, July 13, 1990, 187 SCRA 477), which established that a judge retiring due to disability can later claim pension benefits under Sec 1 if already eligible during retirement.
*   The Court deemed the petition timely, citing Article 1144 of the Civil Code (10-year statute of limitations for obligations created by law) and characterizing the matter as administrative, not adversarial.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Service:** The destruction of official records created a hurdle, reliance was placed on secondary evidence.
*   **Retroactive Application:** The application of *Re: Ruperto G. Martin* effectively allows Judge Alano to convert his disability retirement application to a voluntary retirement application to secure additional monetary benefits.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court ordered the payment of an additional 5-year lump sum gratuity.
*   The Court ordered potential lifetime pension benefits.

*   Republic Act No. 910
