## Legal Document Summary: Mindanao Terminal vs. Phoenix Assurance

**Case:** Mindanao Terminal and Brokerage Service, Inc. vs. Phoenix Assurance Company of New York/ McGee & Co., Inc. G.R. No. 162467, May 8, 2009 (605 Phil. 507)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court (RTC).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Mindanao Terminal and Brokerage Service, Inc. (Mindanao Terminal) - Stevedoring company contracted by Del Monte Philippines, Inc. (Del Monte).
*   **Respondent:** Phoenix Assurance Company of New York (Phoenix) & McGee & Co., Inc. (McGee) - Insurer and Underwriting Manager/Agent of Phoenix, respectively. Subrogees of Del Monte Fresh Produce International, Inc. (Del Monte Produce).

**Facts:**

Del Monte contracted Mindanao Terminal to load and stow cargo (bananas and pineapples belonging to Del Monte Produce) onto a vessel, M/V Mistrau. The cargo was insured by Phoenix under an "open cargo policy," with McGee as the agent. Upon arrival in Korea, the cargo was found damaged. Phoenix, through McGee, paid Del Monte Produce's claim and obtained a subrogation receipt. They then sued Mindanao Terminal for damages in RTC based on negligence in loading and stowing. The RTC ruled in favor of Mindanao Terminal, finding no negligence and no contractual relationship with Del Monte Produce. The CA reversed, holding Mindanao Terminal liable based on quasi-delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code) and imposing a duty of extraordinary diligence.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Cause of Action (Quasi-Delict):** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's finding that Phoenix and McGee have a cause of action against Mindanao Terminal based on quasi-delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code), despite the absence of a direct contractual relationship between Mindanao Terminal and Del Monte Produce.  The Court referenced *Air France v. Carrascoso* (18 SCRA 155) and *PSBA v. CA* (G.R. No. 84698) to support that a tort may arise even under a contract, where the tort is that which breaches the contract.
2.  **Degree of Diligence Required:**  The central issue is the standard of care required of Mindanao Terminal. The SC held that Mindanao Terminal, acting solely as a stevedoring company, is only bound to exercise ordinary diligence (diligence of a good father of a family) under Art. 1173 of the Civil Code, unless law or contract specifies otherwise. The CA erroneously relied on *Summa Insurance Corporation v. CA* (323 Phil. 214), as that case involved an *arrastre* operator (akin to a common carrier or warehouseman with public ramifications) not a stevedore whose responsibility is the handling of the cargo in the holds of the vessel or between the ship's tackle and the holds of the vessel whose responsibility ends upon the loading and stowing of the cargo in the vessel. *Compa√±ia Maritima v. Allied Free Workers Union* (167 Phil. 381) distinguished between arrastre and stevedore functions.
3.  **Negligence:** The SC found that Phoenix and McGee failed to prove by preponderance of evidence that Mindanao Terminal was negligent. The SC adopted the RTC's findings that Mindanao Terminal loaded and stowed the cargo according to the stowage plan provided by Del Monte Produce and the ship's officers, using materials that met industry standards. The loading was done under the supervision of the ship's officers who would not have accepted the cargoes on board the vessel if they were not properly arranged. The survey report from Byeong Yong Ahn, while indicating improper stowage (i.e. arrangement of the cargoes), attributed the damage primarily to a typhoon encountered by the vessel, evidenced by the sea protest.  Referenced *Republic of the Philippines v. Orfinada Sr.* (G.R. No. 141145) to illustrate the burden of proof.
4.  **Attorney's Fees & Actual Damages:** The SC found no basis for awarding attorney's fees as per Art. 2208 of the Civil Code, as there was no showing that the complaint was instituted for vexation or injury. The SC also disallowed the awarded actual damages due to the lack of evidence that Phoenix and McGee made a false claim against Mindanao Terminal necessitating the incurrence of expenditures.

**Holding:**

The SC **GRANTED** the petition. The CA decision was **SET ASIDE**, and the RTC decision was **REINSTATED** except for the awards of attorney's fees and actual damages.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the finding of quasi-delict allows suit absent contractual privity, establishing the standard of care and proving breach remains crucial. This case highlights the evidentiary burden on the plaintiff.
*   The distinction between stevedore and arrastre functions is vital in determining the applicable degree of diligence. Contracts should clearly define the scope of services to mitigate risk.
*   The weight given to the ship officers' acceptance of the cargo and concurrence in the foreman's report suggests that proper documentation and oversight are essential for stevedoring companies to defend against claims.
*   Discrepancies between the surveyor's deposition (improper stowage) and the survey report (typhoon) were fatal to the plaintiff's case, emphasizing the importance of consistent and well-supported expert testimony.
