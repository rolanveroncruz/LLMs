**Liabilities:**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witness (AAA):** The defense could have argued to challenge the credibility of the victim due to some inconsistencies in her testimony.

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-B:** Sets the penalty for rape under Article 266-A.
*   **People v. Bali-Balita (G.R. No. 134266, September 15, 2000):** Clarifies the definition of "carnal knowledge" in rape cases, stating that full penetration is not required.
*   **People v. Valenzuela (G.R. No. 182057, February 6, 2009):** Reiterates that force is not an element of statutory rape and the victim's consent is immaterial.
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004):** Outlines procedure for appeals from RTC to CA in instances where a person has been handed down a sentence of death or life imprisonment

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision finding Edgar Trayco guilty of statutory rape. The prosecution successfully proved the elements of the crime, primarily through the victim's positive identification and corroborating medico-legal evidence. The defense of alibi failed due to inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony and the lack of proof of physical impossibility of being at the scene of the crime. The Court upheld the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and modified the damages to include exemplary damages.
