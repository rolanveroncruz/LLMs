## Legal Document Summary - *City of Makati v. Municipality of Taguig*, G.R. No. 163175

This case is a petition for review on certiorari regarding a territorial dispute between the City of Makati and the Municipality (now City) of Taguig over portions of Fort Bonifacio. Makati filed a petition for prohibition and mandamus (Civil Case No. 96-554) in RTC-Makati, seeking to prevent Taguig from collecting taxes and fees within Fort Bonifacio, and to prevent BCDA and FBDC from paying such to Taguig. The RTC-Makati dismissed the petition, a decision affirmed by the Court of Appeals, due to *litis pendentia* and forum shopping arising from a prior pending case filed by Taguig against Makati in RTC-Pasig (Civil Case No. 63896) seeking judicial confirmation of Taguig's territory and boundary limits, and questioning the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamations transferring portions of Fort Bonifacio to Makati.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **RA 7227 (Bases Conversion and Development Act):** Establishes the BCDA and its authority over military reservations, including portions of Metro Manila military camps transferred to it by the President.
*   **EO 40:** Places portions of Fort Bonifacio under BCDA administration as per plans Swo-00-001265 and Swo-00-001266.
*   **Special Patent No. 3596:** Issued by President Ramos granting tracts of land in Fort Bonifacio to FBDC (after initially issuing Special Patent No. 3595 to BCDA).
*   **OCT No. SP-001:** Original Certificate of Title issued to FBDC based on Special Patent No. 3596.
*   **Civil Case No. 63896 (RTC-Pasig):** Taguig's action for judicial confirmation of its territory and boundary limits against Makati, questioning the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamations transferring parts of Fort Bonifacio to Makati.
*   **Civil Case No. 96-554 (RTC-Makati):** Makati's petition for prohibition and mandamus seeking to prevent Taguig from exercising jurisdiction over Fort Bonifacio, and preventing BCDA/FBDC from paying taxes to Taguig.

**Obligations:**

*   The main contention is which entity, Makati or Taguig, has the right to collect taxes and fees on lands located in Fort Bonifacio.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** Makati's filing of Civil Case No. 96-554 while Civil Case No. 63896 was pending was deemed forum shopping.
*   **Litis Pendentia:** The elements of *litis pendentia* were found to exist because there was an identity of parties with the same interests, identity of rights asserted, and a judgment in one case would amount to *res judicata* in the other.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7227:** Legal basis for BCDA's authority.
*   **Presidential Proclamations Nos. 2475 and 518:** Questioned by Taguig in Civil Case No. 63896.
*   **Agilent Technologies Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. v. Integrated Silicon Technology Philippines Corporation, G.R. No. 154618:** Defines the elements of *litis pendentia*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Territorial Boundaries:** The central issue is the precise location of the territorial boundary between Makati and Taguig in relation to Fort Bonifacio.
*   **Presidential Authority:** Makati questioned whether President Ramos committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing Special Patent No. 3596, but the court did not address the issue as it was not raised during the lower court proceedings.
*   **Validity of Special Patent No. 3596 and OCT No. SP-001:** While Makati argued these documents were invalid, the ultimate issue was whether the land described therein was located in Taguig or Makati.
*   **Lack of absolute identity of parties:** the court held that there was substantial identity of parties, sufficient for the application of the rule on *litis pendentia*.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of Makati's petition due to *litis pendentia* and forum shopping. The key issue is the resolution of the territorial dispute in Civil Case No. 63896 (RTC-Pasig), which will determine the rightful jurisdiction over the disputed areas of Fort Bonifacio. The validity of Special Patent No. 3596, while potentially relevant, is secondary to the primary boundary dispute. Makati faces the risk of further sanctions if it continues to litigate the issue separately after a judgment is rendered in the Pasig case.
