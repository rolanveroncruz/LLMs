## Legal Document Summary: *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Jardine Davies Transport Services, Inc. and Asian Terminals, Inc.*

**Case:** *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Jardine Davies Transport Services, Inc. and Asian Terminals, Inc., G.R. No. 181300, September 18, 2009*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in favor of Malayan Insurance.

**Key Issue:** Whether Malayan Insurance proved a shortage in a shipment of yellow crude sulfur, entitling it to subrogation rights against Jardine Davies and ATI.

**Facts:**

*   Petrosul shipped yellow crude sulfur to LMG Chemicals. Malayan Insurance insured the cargo.
*   Discrepancies in weight were reported at various stages (initial weight per Bill of Lading: 6,599.23 MT, weight upon discharge at LMG's storage area, recorded at 6,206.748 MT).
*   Malayan Insurance paid LMG for the shortage and, as subrogee, sued Jardine Davies (alleged ship agent), ATI (stevedore), CCBI (barge operator) and unknown owner of the vessel, for recovery of the paid amount.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of Malayan Insurance, holding Jardine Davies and ATI solidarily liable.
*   The CA reversed, finding insufficient proof of shortage and the invalidity of the insurance policy.

**CA Holding and Supreme Court Affirmance:**

The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA's decision, finding that Malayan Insurance failed to establish the fact of the shortage in the cargo.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Bill of Lading:** The SC recognized that a bill of lading is prima facie evidence of the goods described therein, however, the CA correctly rebutted this based on discrepancies in weight reported at various stages and the "said to weigh" clause, which places responsibility on the shipper. Cites *Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. v. Prudential Guarantee & Assurance, Inc.* regarding the "said to weigh" clause.
*   **Marine Insurance Policy:** The right of subrogation is contractually tied to the validity of the insurance policy. The Marine Risk Note and Open Marine Insurance Policy, were found to be invalid due to expiry and late payment of premium. Cites *Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.*
*   **ATI's Role:** ATI's participation was limited to stevedoring, with no evidence of negligence or custody of the goods after discharge to barges.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Malayan Insurance:** Failure to prove the cargo's initial weight at the port of origin undermined the claim of a shortage. Risks included invalidity of the insurance policy and inability to prove negligence of the respondents.
*   **Jardine Davies:** No liability established, as they were not the carrier.
*   **ATI:** No negligence proven in stevedoring operations.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Governs review on certiorari, generally limited to questions of law, with exceptions applied here.
*   **Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc. v. Prudential Guarantee & Assurance, Inc.:** Relates to the interpretation of "said to weigh" clauses in Bills of Lading.
*   **Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. Regis Brokerage Corp.:** Highlights the importance of the terms and conditions within the insurance policy for contractual subrogation.
*   **Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Philippine American General Insurance, Co.:** Regarding the Marine Risk Note.
*   **International Container Services, Inc. v. FGU Insurance Corporation, Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation v. Unknown Owner of the Vessel M/V "National Honor:** Highlights the exceptions in the Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Said to weigh" clause:** This clause in the bill of lading was contentious as it transferred the risk of inaccurate weight declaration to the shipper.
*   **Effectivity Clause of the Marine Insurance Policy:** The policy's expiration date and subsequent "endorsement" were critical points of contention, ultimately impacting the subrogation claim.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA's decision, finding that Malayan Insurance failed to provide sufficient evidence of a cargo shortage. Critical to the decision was the "said to weigh" clause, the absence of proof of initial weight at the origin, and the invalidity of the insurance policy. The Court rejected the lower court's finding that the respondents were liable, effectively shifting the loss to Malayan Insurance.
