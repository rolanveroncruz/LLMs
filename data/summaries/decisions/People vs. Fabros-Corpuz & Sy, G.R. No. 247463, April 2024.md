## Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Hon. Amelia A. Fabros-Corpuz and Anthony Archangel y Sy*

**Case:** G.R. No. 247463, April 17, 2024 (Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division)

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court challenging the Resolution of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which modified the penalty imposed on private respondent Anthony Archangel y Sy for three counts of Estafa.

**Key Provisions:**

*   The original RTC (Branch 48, Urdaneta City) convicted Sy of three counts of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by P.D. 818 and R.A. 4885, for issuing worthless checks.
*   Sy filed a Petition to Adjust and Fix Penalty with Urgent Motion to Release before the RTC of Muntinlupa City (Branch 256), arguing that Republic Act No. 10951 (RA 10951) warranted a reduction in his penalty.
*   The RTC (Branch 256) granted the petition, modifying the penalty and ordering Sy's immediate release.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Original Liability:** Sy was originally obligated to serve a sentence of 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day to 6 years of prision mayor as minimum to 6 years and 1 day to 8 years of prision mayor as maximum for each count of Estafa.
*   **Restored Liability:** As a result of this decision, the original RTC imposed penalties are restored (pending remand determination).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal Risk:** The OSG successfully argued that the RTC (Branch 256) committed grave abuse of discretion in misapplying the penalty provisions of RA 10951.
*   **Continued Imprisonment:** Sy risks continued imprisonment if the Muntinlupa City RTC determines, upon remand, that RA 10951 doesn't entitle him to release after proper recomputation of penalties.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the RPC:** Estafa through issuance of worthless checks.
*   **P.D. 818 and R.A. 4885:** Amendments to Article 315, RPC related to Estafa.
*   **Republic Act No. 10951:** Adjusts amounts and fines under the RPC. Specifically, Section 85 amended Article 315. The court references Sections 85 and 100.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in the original sentencing.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Certiorari.
*   **Republic Act No. 10592:** Grants time allowances for good conduct.
*   **Hernan v. Sandiganbayan, 822 Phil. 148 (2017):**  Established that the passage of RA 10951 is an exceptional circumstance which warrants not only the reÂ­opening of an already terminated case, but also the recall of an Entry of Judgment for purposes of modifying the penalty to be served.
*   **In Re: Elbanbuena, 837 Phil. 1025 (2018):**  Outlined guidelines for actions seeking modification of penalties based on RA 10951 and immediate release.
*   **OCA Circular No. 179-2018:**  Highlighted the guidelines set in In Re: Elbanbuena.
*   **Abalos v. People, 859 Phil. 450 (2019):**  Example of applying the penalty for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2 (d) of the RPC for issuing two worthless checks under Section 85 of Republic Act No. 10951.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Misapplication of RA 10951:** The central issue is the proper application of the amended penalties under Section 85 of RA 10951. The RTC (Branch 256) erroneously applied the provision, resulting in a lower penalty.
*   **Retroactive Application of RA 10951:** Whether RA 10951 is favorable to Sy, considering the amended penalties for Estafa committed through worthless checks could result in a *higher* penalty, and whether the original penalties or those provided in Section 85 should be applied.
*   **Validity of Good Conduct Time Allowances:** Whether Sy validly earned time allowances for good conduct, given the deficiencies in the prison record.
*   **Authority of the Bureau of Corrections Officer-in-Charge:** The court noted the BOC Officer-in-Charge signing Sy's prison record was insufficient evidence of good conduct time allowances, as it was not clear that the person was authorised under Section 5 of RA 10592 to do so.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted the Petition for Certiorari, reversing the RTC (Branch 256)'s Resolution. The decision hinged on the RTC's grave abuse of discretion in misapplying the penalty provisions of RA 10951 and improperly ordering Sy's release. The case was remanded to the Muntinlupa RTC to determine the correct penalty and whether Sy is entitled to release.
