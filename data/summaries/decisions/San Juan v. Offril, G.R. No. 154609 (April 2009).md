## Legal Document Summary: *San Juan v. Offril*, G.R. No. 154609 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision regarding the validity of deeds of sale and TCTs (Transfer Certificates of Title) involving a parcel of land.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Dispute:** Celeste Offril (original plaintiff, now deceased and substituted) claimed Ma. Corazon San Juan fraudulently obtained title to her property based on forged deeds of sale. San Juan claimed valid acquisition through purchase.
*   **RTC Decision:** Only TCTs for Lots 20-A and 20-B in San Juan's name were valid, based on a Deed of Partition between the parties. Deeds of Sale for the remaining lots were declared null and void, and their corresponding TCTs were ordered cancelled.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC. The CA found Offril credibly proved fraud through forgery regarding the general power of authority and deeds of conveyance. The Deed of Partition was crucial in establishing that Offril did not intend to sell the entire property, and San Juan did not intend to buy the entire property, and which the appellate court gave the trial court deference on Offril's credibility as a witness.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the CA decision, denying San Juan's petition.
*   **Validity of Deeds of Sale:** Deeds of Sale dated April 2, 1979 and June 14, 1979 are declared null and void, as is the validity of TCTs 170405, 170406, 170407, and 170408 which pertain to lot Nos. 20-C, 20-D, 20-E, and 20-F. New titles for the aforementioned lots will be issued to Offril.
*   **TCTs for Lots 20-A and 20-B:** TCT 170403 and TCT 170404 in San Juan's name pertaining to lots 20-A and 20-B are valid.
*   **No Damages:** The parties are to shoulder their respective costs and damages.

**Obligations:**

*   San Juan is obligated to surrender the titles (TCT Nos. 170405, 170406, 170407, 170408) to Lots 20-C, 20-D, 20-E, and 20-F for cancellation.
*   The Registry of Deeds is obligated to cancel the specified TCTs and issue new titles to Offril (or her successors-in-interest) for the remaining lots.

**Liabilities:**

*   San Juan's claim to full ownership of the entire property is invalid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Claims:** Although the CA stated fraud through forgery was proven, the Supreme Court focused more on the questionable circumstances surrounding the deeds' registration and the Deed of Partition, rather than a definitive finding of forgery by the lower court.
*   **Estoppel:** The Supreme Court found San Juan estopped by the Deed of Partition, implying she acknowledged Offril's ownership of the remaining lots.
*   **Offril's Testimony:** San Juan challenged the credibility of Offril's testimony, alleging Alzheimer's or memory loss. The courts rejected this, but future disputes could arise regarding the validity of her testimony.
*   **Deed of Partition:** Validity of the deed of partition may be challenged.
*   **Relevance of Ante-dating:** The court found the question of whether the deed of sales was antedated immaterial as Offril never executed them.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presumption of Regularity of Notarized Documents:** The court acknowledged but ultimately rebutted the presumption, citing *Nazareno v. Court of Appeals* and *Mayor v. Belen*.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** *People v. Conde* was cited regarding the trial court's advantage in assessing witness credibility.
*   **Conclusiveness of Factual Findings:** Courts do not generally weigh evidence again unless it is found the lower court is totally devoid of support and/or clearly erroneous.
*   **Doctrine of Estoppel:** San Juan is found to be estopped by the Deed of Partition.

**Ambiguities/Areas for Further Scrutiny:**

*   The precise basis for invalidating the deeds of sale – forgery vs. circumstantial evidence – could be further explored. The CA's language suggests forgery was affirmatively proven, while the SC's decision focuses more on the suspicious circumstances.
*   The scope and effect of the estoppel finding require clarification.
