**Case Summary: Wong v. Moya II, A.C. No. 6972, October 17, 2008**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Salvador N. Moya II initiated by Jerry T. Wong, alleging violation of B.P. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law), non-payment of debt, and breach of professional responsibility.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Financial Dealings:** Respondent allegedly obtained financial assistance from Complainant for housing and a car, reimbursing with checks later dishonored due to "Account Closed."  He also allegedly failed to pay for construction materials sourced via Complainant's introduction, causing embarrassment to the Complainant.
*   **Handling of Civil Case No. 1482:** Respondent, as counsel for Complainant, received payment from a judgment debtor (Diwa) but failed to promptly remit or inform the Complainant.
*   **IBP Proceedings:** Respondent repeatedly sought extensions to file an answer, then filed a Motion to Dismiss (prohibited under IBP rules), and was eventually declared in default. He failed to submit a position paper despite being granted the opportunity.
*   **Violation of Code of Professional Responsibility:** The complaint centers around violations of Canon 1 (obey laws), Rule 1.01 (no unlawful/dishonest conduct), Canon 7 (uphold integrity), and Rule 7.03 (no conduct reflecting unfitness).

**IBP Findings and Recommendations:**

*   Investigating Commissioner recommended a one-year suspension.
*   IBP Board of Governors adopted and modified the recommendation, ordering a two-year suspension.

**Supreme Court Decision:**

*   Affirmed the IBP's finding of guilt *in toto* and upheld the two-year suspension.
*   The Court found the issuance of worthless checks and failure to pay debts constituted gross misconduct. The Court also cited breaches of trust, and disregarding of the IBP's orders.

**Key Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Debt Repayment:** Implied obligation to repay debts to Complainant, Unisia Merchandising, and Tomlin.
*   **Adherence to Lawyer's Oath:** Respondent violated the oath by engaging in dishonest conduct and delaying delivery of funds to his client.
*   **Compliance with Court and IBP Orders:** Failed to comply with orders to file an answer and attend hearings.
*   **Fiduciary Duty:**  Breached fiduciary duty to the client by withholding information regarding payments received and failing to remit funds promptly.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **B.P. 22 Violation:**  While the disbarment is not *solely* based on B.P. 22, the issuance of bad checks is a significant factor. This raises concerns about potential criminal liability as well, although this proceeding is administrative in nature.
*   **Misappropriation of Funds:** The failure to remit the Diwa payment raises a serious question of potential misappropriation or conversion of client funds.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:**  Respondent claimed financial constraints.  However, he needed to have explained, with particularity, the circumstances which caused his failure to meet his obligations, which he failed to do.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension.
*   **Co v. Bernardino, A.C. No. 3919:** Issuance of worthless checks as gross misconduct.
*   **Lao v. Medel, A.C. No. 5916:**  Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 violations through issuance of bad checks.
*   **Cuizon v. Macalino, A.C. No. 4334:** Dishonored checks indicate unfitness.
*   **Sanchez v. Somoso, A.C. No. 6061:** Persistent refusal to settle obligations reflects poorly on the profession.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The degree to which the initial financial assistance was a loan versus a gift. If the support was provided out of generosity and not a loan, the allegations may have had different outcomes.

**Note:** This is a summary for informational purposes and should not be considered a substitute for a full review of the original document.  Further investigation into the financial transactions, the specific facts surrounding the Diwa payment, and respondent's financial situation is recommended.
