## Legal Document Summary: *Benguet Corporation v. DENR-MAB and J.G. Realty and Mining Corporation*

**Case:** G.R. No. 163101, February 13, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Annulment of DENR-MAB Decision and Resolution upholding the cancellation of a Royalty Agreement with Option to Purchase (RAWOP) and exclusion from a joint Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) application.

**Key Provisions of RAWOP (June 1, 1987):**

*   J.G. Realty is the owner of four mining claims (Bonito I-IV).
*   Benguet obligated to perfect rights to mining claims and determine development viability within 24 months.
*   Benguet to examine the claims to determine profitable production viability and furnish J.G. Realty with a report within a reasonable time after the examination is completed.
*   Benguet obligated to conduct the necessary exploration in accordance with a prepared exploration program during the examination period.
*   Benguet could develop mining claims upon written notice to J.G. Realty and place claims into commercial production within 24 months thereafter.
*   J.G. Realty entitled to a 5% royalty on net realizable value if mining claims are in commercial production.
*   Section 11.01: Mandatory arbitration clause for disputes, differences or disagreements related to the Agreement.
*   Section 14.05: Payment of royalties via deposit into J.G. Realty's designated bank account.

**Key Events/Allegations:**

*   August 9, 1989: Benguet informs J.G. Realty of its intent to develop the mining claims.
*   February 9, 1999: J.G. Realty terminates RAWOP citing Benguet's failure to perform obligations, violation due to "high graders," no term limit stipulation, and non-payment of royalties.
*   Benguet alleges compliance by investing PhP 42.4 million, commercial operation hampered by MGB's non-issuance of Mines Temporary Permit, high graders pre-existed the agreement, and royalties were available for pick-up.
*   June 7, 2000: J.G. Realty files Petition for Declaration of Nullity/Cancellation of the RAWOP with the POA.
*   March 19, 2001: POA cancels RAWOP and excludes Benguet from the joint MPSA application.
*   MAB upholds the POA decision.

**Issues:**

1.  **Mandatory Arbitration:** Should the controversy have been submitted to arbitration before the POA took cognizance of the case? The Court found that it should have been submitted to voluntary arbitration per RAWOP, however, the Court ruled that Benguet was estopped from questioning the POA's jurisdiction.
2.  **Sufficiency of Evidence for Cancellation:** Was the cancellation of the RAWOP supported by evidence? The Court ruled that it was supported by the evidence because Benguet failed to pay the royalties as per section 14.05 of the RAWOP, and failed to show any action in perfecting rights to the claims per the MPSA application.
3.  **Unjust Enrichment:** Did the cancellation of the RAWOP amount to unjust enrichment of J.G. Realty at the expense of Benguet? The court found that the cancellation was based on a valid ground and therefore there was no unjust enrichment.

**Ruling:**

*   Petition dismissed. DENR-MAB Decision and Resolution affirmed.
*   The court initially found that Benguet followed an improper remedy in filing a Rule 65 petition with the Supreme Court without appealing the MAB decision to the Court of Appeals. The Court also ruled that the MAB upheld the decision of the POA.
*   The Court ruled that the POA decision was valid given the fact that Benguet participated in the MAB hearing, motion for reconsideration, and petition of the decision with the Supreme Court implying recognition of the POA's jurisdiction.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Benguet:** Failed to pay royalties according to the RAWOP's bank deposit provision (Section 14.05). Failed to actively pursue MPSA application (duty to perfect rights to mining claims).
*   **J.G. Realty:** Had the right to terminate RAWOP due to Benguet's breaches.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Term Limit:** J.G. Realty cited the lack of a term limit as a reason for termination, but this was not the primary basis for the POA/MAB decisions.
*   **"High Graders":** Allegation of Benguet allowing illegal mining activities.
*   **Force Majeure:** Benguet attempted to invoke the non-issuance of the Mines Temporary Permit as force majeure to excuse their delay, but this argument was rejected.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court found that the POA did not have jurisdiction, but since Benguet participated in the proceedings and sought affirmative relief, it was estopped from challenging jurisdiction.
*   **Interpretation of "Perfecting the Rights to the Mining Claims"** Did Benguet diligently pursue the MPSA application?

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of adhering to contractual provisions, especially those regarding payment and diligent performance. Benguet's failure to deposit royalty payments as stipulated in the RAWOP and its lack of evidence demonstrating active pursuit of the MPSA application were fatal to its case. The application of estoppel against Benguet regarding the POA's jurisdiction is also significant. While mandatory arbitration clauses are generally upheld, failure to timely raise the issue of lack of jurisdiction can result in waiver. The Court emphasizes the importance of adhering to the established hierarchy of courts in administrative appeals. When assessing similar contracts, advise clients to: (1) strictly comply with payment provisions; (2) maintain thorough records of efforts to fulfill obligations (e.g., pursuing permits); and (3) promptly challenge jurisdictional issues to avoid estoppel. The specific terms of the agreement are paramount, as demonstrated by the court's strict interpretation of the payment clause.
