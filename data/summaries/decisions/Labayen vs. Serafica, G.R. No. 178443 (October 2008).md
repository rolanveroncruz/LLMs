## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Labayen v. Serafica*, G.R. No. 178443 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to nullify the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) dismissal of the Petitioner's action for Cancellation of Encumbrance.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Milagros Serafica (original lessor) leased a property to Ana Labayen (lessee) for 15 years (August 16, 1992 - August 15, 2007) at increasing monthly rentals (₱15k, ₱20k, ₱25k). Lease agreement included an automatic cancellation clause (Section 14) upon failure to pay rentals or comply with the contract terms.  A deposit equivalent to two months' rental was required upon execution of the contract.
*   **Donation & Transfer:** Milagros donated the property to Leonardo Serafica (Respondent) in 1994, with the lease agreement annotation carried over to the new title.
*   **Cancellation of Lease:** A Cancellation of Contract of Lease allegedly executed between Labayen and Serafica was annotated on the title in 1996, cancelling the original lease annotation. Labayen claimed forgery.
*   **Non-Payment:** The RTC and CA found that the Labayens failed to pay the required deposit and monthly rentals, triggering the automatic cancellation clause.
*   **Delivery of Possession:** The court found that possession of the property was delivered to Petitioners in 1995 despite their claims.
*   **Expiration of Lease:** The original lease term expired on August 15, 2007.

**Obligations:**

*   **Lessee (Labayen):** Obligation to pay the rental deposit and stipulated monthly rentals. Obligation to adhere to the contract terms, breach of which triggers automatic cancellation.
*   **Lessor (Serafica):** Initially, the obligation to deliver possession.  Later, the Court impliedly acknowledges the right of the Lessor to invoke the automatic termination clause upon breach by the Lessee.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lessee (Labayen):**
    *   **Loss of Leasehold Rights:** The automatic cancellation clause, coupled with the failure to pay, resulted in the loss of leasehold rights.
    *   **No Cause of Action:** Lack of cause of action to challenge the cancellation of the lease encumbrance due to the breach of contract.
    *   **Damages Claim Dismissal:** The petition for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees was dismissed.
*   **Lessor (Serafica):** Limited liabilities given the court's findings. The alleged forgery of the cancellation document was deemed irrelevant, as the lease was already effectively terminated due to the Labayens' non-compliance.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Articles 2219 and 2220:** Cited concerning the requisites for awarding moral and exemplary damages.
*   ***BPI Express Card Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, 357 Phil. 262 (1998):**  Cited regarding the distinction between injury and damage, and the principle of *damnum absque injuria* (damage without legal injury).
*   **Automatic Cancellation Clause:** The validity and enforceability of the automatic cancellation clause in lease agreements is affirmed, provided that the lessee is demonstrably in breach of contract (non-payment).
*   **Cause of Action Requirement** To maintain an action, the plaintiff must demonstrate a right was violated. (This was explicitly lacking as petitioners had no right to enforce the contract after failing to perform their obligations.)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alleged Forgery of Cancellation Deed:** While the RTC found that the signatures on the cancellation deed were likely forged, it deemed this irrelevant as the automatic cancellation clause was already in effect due to the Lessees' non-performance.  This could be contentious if the Lessor had been complicit in a forgery.
*   **Delivery of Possession:** The Petitioners alleged that there was no delivery of possession of the property which contributed to their failure to pay rent and abide by the terms of the contract.  This point was contested and ultimately disproven as the Courts cited open testimony from the Petitioners demonstrating that possession was delivered.

**Overall Legal Analysis:**

The Court sided with the Respondent, Leonardo Serafica, because the Petitioners, the Labayens, failed to fulfill their obligations under the lease agreement, specifically the payment of the deposit and monthly rentals. This triggered the automatic cancellation clause, effectively terminating the lease before the cancellation deed was even executed. The alleged forgery, while potentially problematic in other circumstances, was rendered moot by the Labayens' breach. The Court's decision highlights the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and the enforceability of automatic cancellation clauses in lease agreements when there is clear evidence of default. The principle of *damnum absque injuria* was properly applied as the Labayens suffered damages not from an illegal act by Serafica, but from their own failure to comply with the contract. Furthermore, the expiration of the lease term during the litigation process further weakened the Petitioners' claim.
