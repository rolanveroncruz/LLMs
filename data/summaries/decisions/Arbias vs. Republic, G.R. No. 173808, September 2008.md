**Case:** *Fernanda Arbias vs. The Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 173808, September 17, 2008. (587 Phil. 361)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by Fernanda Arbias, seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the RTC's grant of her application for original land registration under Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree). The Supreme Court denied Arbias's petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 14(1):**  Outlines requirements for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. Applicant must prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of *alienable and disposable* public land under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier. This is the primary statutory basis for the claim.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The applicant (Arbias) bears the burden to prove (1) possession since June 12, 1945, or earlier; and (2) that the land is classified as alienable and disposable.
*   **Regalian Doctrine:** All lands of the public domain belong to the State. This is the starting presumption that the applicant needs to overcome.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Possession:** Arbias failed to provide sufficient evidence of her and her predecessor-in-interest's possession in the manner and for the period required under Section 14(1) of PD 1529. The evidence she presented (Deed of Sale, Tax Declarations, Survey Plan, Technical Description) was insufficient to establish the nature and duration of possession needed to meet the requirements under the law. Specifically, no proof was adduced that the land was possessed by Arbias or her predecessor-in-interest since June 12, 1945.
*   **Failure to Prove Alienability:** Arbias failed to prove that the subject property was classified as alienable and disposable land. Reliance on a surveyor's notation in the blueprint was deemed insufficient based on *Menguito v. Republic* (401 Phil. 274 (2000)) which held a mere surveyor has no authority to reclassify lands of the public domain. Positive government action is required. This is a high-risk area for applicants.
*   **Estoppel Does Not Apply:** The Court held that estoppel does not operate against the State in this case and that the OSG is not bound by the actions or inactions of the City Prosecutor at the RTC level because in land registration cases, the Solicitor General is not merely the principal, but the only legal counsel of the government.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14(1):**  The core statutory provision outlining requirements for judicial confirmation of imperfect title.
*   **Menguito v. Republic, 401 Phil. 274 (2000):**  Establishes that a surveyor's notation of alienability is insufficient proof for original registration. The Supreme Court reiterated the fact that the surveyor cannot be relied upon to prove that the land in question is alienable.
*   **Spouses Reyes v. Court of Appeals, 356 Phil. 606, 622 (1998):** Case cited as basis for the Regalian Doctrine, where it states that all lands not otherwise appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State.
*   **Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 317 Phil. 374, 376 (1984):** Case cited, where it establishes that the Court has a bounden duty, even in the absence of any opposition, to require the petitioner to show, by a preponderance of evidence and by positive and absolute proof, so far as possible, that he is the owner in fee simple of the lands which he is attempting to register.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of sufficient proof of "open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation" is fact-dependent and frequently litigated.  Tax declarations and self-serving statements are generally insufficient without corroborating evidence.
*   Determination of when land is "alienable and disposable" is another frequent point of contention. Official government classification is required.

**Overall Assessment:**

The applicant's claim was weak due to a lack of concrete evidence regarding both the duration of possession and the alienable/disposable nature of the land. The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the stringent requirements for original land registration and underscores the burden placed on the applicant to overcome the presumption of State ownership. Applicants face an uphill battle unless they can demonstrate continuous possession back to June 12, 1945, *and* prove the land's alienable status through official government documentation.
