**Case Summary: *Pe単alber v. Ramos*, G.R. No. 178645 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which reversed the RTC's ruling in favor of the Petitioner (Pe単alber) regarding a claim of ownership over real property based on a verbal trust agreement.

**Facts:** Petitioner claimed ownership of the "Bonifacio property" based on a verbal agreement with Respondents (Spouses Ramos), alleging they purchased the property on her behalf using funds from her hardware store managed by them.  A key piece of evidence was an alleged discrepancy between the initial and final inventory of the store's stock, which the Petitioner claimed was used for the purchase of the property. The Respondents held a deed of sale for the property in their name.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Verbal Trust Agreement (Express Trust):** Petitioner argued an express trust existed, obligating Respondents to reconvey the Bonifacio property. The crucial issue is whether the existence of the trust was sufficiently proven.
*   **Statute of Frauds (Art. 1443, Civil Code):** Respondents initially argued that since the purported trust involved immovable property, it must be in writing. The Court noted a waiver of objections. However, the Statute is for evidentiary purposes.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterates that the petitioner bore the burden of proving the express trust. The Court found that the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient and credible evidence.
*   **Preponderance of Evidence:** The Court states that there was lack of preponderance of evidence to support the existence of a verbal trust agreement.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Pe単alber):** Had the obligation to prove the existence of the express trust by a preponderance of evidence. This includes demonstrating the intention to create the trust.
*   **Respondents (Spouses Ramos):** While initially having a potential liability to reconvey the property if the trust were proven, the court determined that this liability was not established.
*     **Respondent (Bartex, Inc.):** Buyer of property in good faith.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1440-1444 (Trusts):** Defines express and implied trusts, the requirements for creating them, and the need for written evidence when dealing with immovable property.

*   **Conlu v. Araneta, 15 Phil. 387, 391 (1910).** Oral evidence of the contract will be excluded upon timely objection. But if the parties to the action, during the trial, make no objection to the admissibility of the oral evidence to support the contract covered by the statute, and thereby permit such contract to be proved orally, it will be just as binding upon the parties as if it had been reduced to writing.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The key ambiguity lies in determining whether a true trust agreement existed based on the parties' conduct and alleged oral statements.
*   **Statute of Frauds application:** While technically waived, the lack of a written agreement significantly weakened Petitioner's case, making it difficult to establish the requisite intent to create a trust.
*   **Speculative evidence:** The RTC's reliance on the inventory discrepancy was deemed speculative and insufficient to prove a clear intent to establish a trust.
*   **Evidentiary Weakness:** The limited evidence available to prove the existence of a trust, such as the discrepancy between the initial and final inventories, was deemed insufficient to meet the burden of proof. The testimonies of the Petitioner and her son was deemed not credible.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling against the Petitioner. The key reason was the failure to provide sufficient evidence, meeting the required threshold, to prove the existence of an express trust. The inventory discrepancy was deemed speculative, and the lack of a written agreement, while not a bar to admissibility due to waiver, made it extremely difficult to demonstrate the intent to create a trust, as required by law. The decision underscores the importance of having written agreements, especially regarding real property and trusts.
