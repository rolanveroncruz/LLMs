## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Castillo and Mejia* (G.R. No. 171188)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for review of the Sandiganbayan's resolution dismissing a criminal complaint against respondents Castillo (Municipal Mayor) and Mejia (Municipal Building Official) for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The alleged violation stems from the respondents' act of fencing off property owned by complainant Sarino and his siblings, causing undue injury due to lost rental income and decreased property value.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** This is the central statutory basis, penalizing public officers who cause undue injury to any party through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Obligations of Public Officials:** The core issue is whether the respondents, in their official capacities, breached their duty to act impartially and without negligence, causing undue injury to the complainants. The issue of acting on good faith is raised but the Court finds that premature.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** The Information charges the respondents with a violation of RA 3019 Sec. 3(e), potentially leading to imprisonment and other penalties as prescribed by law.
*   **Financial Damages:** The Information specifies damages of Php 790,920.00, representing lost rental income, unpaid compensation for the portion of the property on which the fence was installed, and the decrease in value of the property for commercial purposes.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judicial vs. Executive Determination of Probable Cause:** The central legal issue is whether the Sandiganbayan improperly overturned the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause after warrants of arrest were issued. The Court emphasizes the distinction between the executive (Ombudsman) and judicial (Sandiganbayan) determination of probable cause, underscoring the limited scope of judicial review absent grave abuse of discretion or an invalid information.
*   **"Undue Injury":** The element of "undue injury" is a key point of contention. The Sandiganbayan dismissed the case, finding no such injury, while the prosecution argues the fencing caused significant financial harm. The Court holds that such is premature to be decided and the absence or presence of an element of the crime is evidentiary in nature and may be best passed upon during trial.
*   **"Manifest Partiality, Evident Bad Faith, or Gross Inexcusable Negligence":** The presence of one of these elements is necessary for a violation of Sec. 3(e). The Sandiganbayan found none, but the prosecution argues that the respondents lacked legal basis for fencing the property, suggesting bad faith or negligence.
* **Amendments to the information:** Respondents argued that because there were substantial amendments made to the information (additional injured parties and specification of damages), the Sandiganbayan was correct in exercising its judicial prerogative when it determined for itself the existence of probable cause considering the inconsistency of the positions taken by the Ombudsman in OMB-1-00-0537 and the instant case. The court denied this.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e):** The core statutory basis of the charges.
*   **Republic Act No. 6770 Section 20:** An Act Providing for the Functional and Structural Organization of the Office of the Ombudsman and for Other Purposes.
*   **Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court:** addresses sufficiency of complaint or information.
*   ***Paderanga v. Drilon, G.R. No. 96080***
*   ***Roberts, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 113930***
*   ***Ho v. People, G.R. Nos. 106632 & 106678***
*   ***People v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126005***
*   ***Schroeder v. Saldevar, G.R. No. 163656***
*   ***Go v. Fifth Division, Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 172602***
*   ***Andres v. Cuevas, G.R. No. 150869***

**Ambiguities & Concerns:**

*   **Good Faith Defense:** The respondents' claim of good faith in enforcing the National Building Code. The Court does not agree because it is evidentiary in nature and may be best passed upon during trial.
*   **Rehash of Previous Case:** The Sandiganbayan argues that the case is a mere rehash of the previously dismissed criminal case filed by complainant's lessees against respondents. The Court does not agree with this as it is a separate case.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the Sandiganbayan's resolutions dismissing the case, and ordered the reinstatement of the Information against the respondents. The Court held that the Sandiganbayan erred in overturning the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause, emphasizing the judiciary's policy of non-interference in the Ombudsman's constitutionally mandated powers.
