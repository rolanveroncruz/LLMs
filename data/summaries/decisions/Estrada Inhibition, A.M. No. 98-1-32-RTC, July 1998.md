**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 98-1-32-RTC**

**Subject:** Disciplinary action against Judge Bienvenido R. Estrada for violating Circular No. 6.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Judge Estrada violated Circular No. 6 dated April 10, 1987, which prohibits judges from holding positions in private enterprises (specifically cited is director or similar positions).
*   **Facts:** Judge Estrada was appointed to the judiciary on May 17, 1994, but did not resign from his position on the Board of Directors of the Rural Bank of Labrador until May 31, 1997.
*   **Defense:** Judge Estrada resigned his position effective May 31, 1997.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to comply with administrative circulars, specifically Circular No. 6, and to maintain professional competence.
*   Judges have a continuing duty to keep abreast of legal and jurisprudential developments.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Estrada is found administratively liable for violating Circular No. 6.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Repetition of similar acts will result in more severe disciplinary action.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Circular No. 6 (April 10, 1987):** The primary basis for the disciplinary action.
*   **In Re: Comelec Resolution No. 2521, A.M. 92-12-916 RTC, July 8, 1994:** Cited regarding the need for judges to keep abreast of legal developments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document does not explicitly address whether the Rural Bank of Labrador's business dealings directly conflicted with Judge Estrada's judicial duties or created any demonstrable prejudice to any party. However, the rule is a per se prohibition, so specific prejudice is not necessarily required for a violation.
*   While Judge Estrada's good faith and resignation are considered mitigating factors, they do not excuse the initial violation. The case suggests a strict liability standard for failing to comply with Circular No. 6.

**Disposition:**

*   Judge Estrada is reprimanded with a warning.
