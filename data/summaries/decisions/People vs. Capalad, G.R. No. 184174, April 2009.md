## Legal Document Summary: People v. Capalad, G.R. No. 184174 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Reynaldo Capalad for violations of Sections 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs) and 11 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs) of Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** Prohibits and penalizes the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **Sec. 11, Art. II, RA 9165 (Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** Prohibits and penalizes the unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody:**  The prosecution has the obligation to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs, demonstrating the handling of the evidence from seizure to presentation in court. This is a critical element for proving corpus delicti.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Courts presume regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement officers. The defense bears the burden of overcoming this presumption with clear and convincing evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Accused-appellant was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of PhP 500,000 for the sale of 0.04 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) under Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165. He was also sentenced to 12 years, 8 months, and 1 day to 17 years, 8 months, and a fine of PhP 300,000 for the possession of 0.14 gram of shabu under Sec. 11, Art. II, RA 9165.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The accused argued no entrapment occurred, implying instigation. The court found the buy-bust operation valid, dismissing this argument due to the established elements of sale.
*   **Extortion Allegation:** The accused alleged extortion by police officers.  This was rejected due to lack of clear and convincing evidence.  The court upheld the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. Failure to file a formal complaint against the officers weakened this claim.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case hinges on the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses (police officers) versus the accused and his son. The courts gave more weight to the police officers' testimonies.
*   **Testimony of Child Witness:** The accused emphasized the testimony of his young son. The court found his testimony doubtful due to his relationship to the accused and inconsistencies in his statements, particularly regarding hearing the term "warrant of arrest" only on television.
*   **Chain of Custody Documentation:** The summary suggests adequate documentation of the chain of custody, but scrutiny of actual documentation (markings, handling records) is crucial. Any breaks in the chain could invalidate the evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Art. II, Sec. 5 & 11:** The core statutory basis for the charges and penalties.
*   **Case law on Chain of Custody:** The court implicitly references established jurisprudence regarding the requirements for maintaining an unbroken chain of custody to ensure the integrity of drug evidence (e.g., *Jones v. State*).
*   **Case law on Presumption of Regularity:** The court relies on precedent regarding the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by law enforcement officers, requiring the defense to present clear and convincing evidence to rebut this presumption (e.g., *People v. Bayani*, *People v. Naquita*).
*    **People v. Cabacaba, G.R. No. 171310, July 9, 2008, 557 SCRA 475, 484 -** Used to describe the credibility contest that arises in drug prosecution cases between the accused and the police.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court finds the sentence "stiff," but enforces it citing "Dura Lex Sed Lex".
*   The exact marking specifics and procedure of securing, preserving, transporting, testing and recording specimens in order to have an unbroken chain of custody must be shown.

**Overall Assessment:** The appellate court upheld the conviction based on the credibility of prosecution witnesses and the failure of the defense to present clear and convincing evidence to support its claims of extortion and frame-up. The chain of custody of the drug evidence appears to have been adequately established. A close review of the evidence presented on chain of custody is warranted to assess the solidity of the conviction. Also, there seems to be an alibi that was discarded since the child said the incident occurred at 8PM.
