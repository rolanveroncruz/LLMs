## Legal Document Summary: People v. Partoza

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Edwin Partoza y Evora*, G.R. No. 182418, May 8, 2009

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Edwin Partoza y Evora (Appellant) for violation of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically illegal possession (Section 11) and illegal sale (Section 5) of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Appellant was charged with two counts: (1) possession of 0.04 gram of shabu (Crim. Case No. 6524); and (2) sale of 0.04 gram of shabu (Crim. Case No. 6525) stemming from a buy-bust operation.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** PO3 Tougan, acting as poseur-buyer, purchased shabu from Appellant. Appellant was arrested, and another sachet was allegedly recovered.
*   **Evidence:** Two sachets of white crystalline substance tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   **Defense:** Appellant denied the charges, claiming he was a tricycle driver falsely accused.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted Appellant on both counts: 12 years & 1 day to 20 years imprisonment and a fine of P300,000 for possession; life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000 for sale.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the RTC conviction.

**Ruling:**
* The Supreme Court REVERSED and SET ASIDE the Court of Appeals' decision, ACQUITTING Appellant based on reasonable doubt.

**Key Issues & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The Court found a break in the chain of custody of the seized drugs. Critical steps, including immediate marking, inventory, and photographing of the seized items in the presence of the accused and required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected public official), were not followed as mandated by Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.
*   **Failure to observe Section 21 R.A. 9165**: The police officer, PO3 Tougan, did not mark the drugs immediately after the arrest but did so at the police station. There was no inventory or photograph taken in the presence of the appellant, nor were the required witnesses present.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court rejected the application of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties due to the police's non-compliance with mandatory procedures. *People v. Garcia* (G.R. No. 173480, 25 February 2009).
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The Court emphasized that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the *corpus delicti* (the seized drugs) beyond a reasonable doubt due to the break in the chain of custody. Citing *People v. Obmiranis* (G.R. No. 181492, 16 December 2008), *Bondad v. People* (G.R. No. 173804, 10 December 2008), and *People v. De la Cruz* (G.R. No. 177222, 29 October 2008).
*   **Elements of the Crime:** The court reiterated the elements of illegal sale (*People v. Agulay*, G.R. No. 181747, 26 September 2008) and possession (*People v. Naquita*, G.R. No. 180511, 28 July 2008) of dangerous drugs.
*   **Retroactivity**: The OSG argued that Section 21 of R.A. 9165 was not yet applicable at the time of the commission of the crime. The court did not directly address this argument, implying the law's applicability to the case.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Strictures:** This case emphasizes the stringent requirements of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 regarding the handling of seized drugs. Failure to strictly adhere to these procedures can result in acquittal, even if a buy-bust operation appears legitimate.
*   **Presumption of Regularity Limitations:** The ruling clarifies that the presumption of regularity does not apply when there is evidence of non-compliance with established legal procedures by law enforcement officers.
*   **Impact on Future Cases:** This case serves as a reminder that meticulous documentation and adherence to established protocols are crucial in drug-related cases to ensure the integrity of evidence and avoid challenges based on chain of custody issues. The acquittals of other cases cited by the Court, further highlight the importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to properly document and maintain the chain of custody of the seized drugs led to the Appellant's acquittal, underscoring the constitutional right to be presumed innocent and the burden of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
