**Case Summary: Titong v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 111141, March 6, 1998 (350 Phil. 544)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's judgment in favor of private respondents in an action for quieting of title.

**Key Issue:** Ownership of a 20,592 sq. m. parcel of land in Masbate.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA decision but modifies the award of damages.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Ownership based on: survey plan, tax declarations, Commissioner's report on relocation survey, and possession for over 20 years.
*   **Private Respondents' Claim:** Ownership derived from a series of conveyances originating from a sale by petitioner to Pablo Espinosa in 1962, ending with their purchase in 1981, with continuous tax declarations aligning with their claim.
*   **Court's Rationale:**

    *   **Improper Action for Quieting of Title:** The complaint should have been dismissed outright. An action for quieting of title requires a "cloud" on the title stemming from an instrument, record, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding (Art. 476, Civil Code). The alleged physical intrusion by respondents does not constitute such a cloud. It is a boundary dispute and act of forcible entry. Citing *Vda. de Aviles v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 95748, November 21, 1996*.
    *   **Petitioner's Abdication of Ownership:** Petitioner previously sold the property to private respondent's predecessor-in-interest (Espinosa), thereby transferring ownership (Art. 1458, Civil Code).
    *   **Lack of Acquisitive Prescription:** Petitioner's possession lacked "just title" and "good faith" (Arts. 1117, 1134, Civil Code). The act of altering the river boundary was an act of bad faith.  Extraordinary prescription also fails, as the alleged possession was less than 30 years (Art. 1137, Civil Code). *Santiago v. Cruz, 19 Phil. 145 (1911)*
    *   **Insufficient Evidence of Ownership:**

        *   **Survey Plan:**  Not conclusive as to ownership as it may refer only to a delineation of possession; private writing, unapproved by the Bureau of Lands, *Heirs of George Bofill v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 107930, October 7, 1994*.
        *   **Tax Declaration:** Merely an indicium of a claim of ownership, not conclusive evidence (*Rivera v. Court of Appeals, 314 Phil. 57 (1995)*); discrepancy in the area claimed.

*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court increased moral damages from P10,000.00 to P30,000.00 due to fraud and bad faith. Attorneyâ€™s fees were justified as the civil action was clearly unfounded (Art. 2208 (4), Civil Code).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Technicalities:** The Court heavily emphasizes the technical requirements for an action to quiet title.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The decision highlights discrepancies between the survey plans, tax declarations, and actual areas claimed, indicating potential issues with the factual basis.
* **Boundary Dispute:** The determination that this case is actually a boundary dispute could have implications on future actions if the land is subsequently registered.

**For a lawyer's perspective, the key takeaways are the strict application of the requirements for a quieting of title action, the importance of consistent land records and surveys, and the difficulty in claiming ownership through prescription without good faith and just title. The case also underscores the binding nature of prior conveyances.**
