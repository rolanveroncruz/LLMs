Okay, here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *UST Faculty Union vs. University of Santo Tomas* G.R. No. 180892, April 7, 2009.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Issue:** Whether the University of Santo Tomas (UST) committed Unfair Labor Practices (ULP) in violation of Article 248(a) and (d) of the Labor Code. Specifically, whether UST interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization and whether it initiated, dominated, assisted, or otherwise interfered with the formation or administration of a labor organization.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision which held that UST was *not* guilty of ULP. The SC upheld the lower tribunals' findings that the UST Faculty Union (USTFU) failed to present substantial evidence to support its ULP allegations.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Rival Union Factions:**  A dispute arose within the USTFU between the incumbent leadership (Mariño Group) and a reformist group (Gamilla Group) which held a convocation-election.

*   **Convocation/Election:** UST, through Fr. Aligan, issued a memorandum *allowing* faculty clubs to hold a convocation. The Mariño Group claims it was a ULP. The SC found no coercion or required attendance in the memorandum and noted UST administration members were not present.
 * **Relevant Legal Principle:** "Totality of conduct doctrine"- Albeit the October 2, 1996 Memorandum issued by respondent Rev. Fr. Aligan allowing the conduct of the convocation of the University faculty clubs, on which occasion the questioned election of the Gamilla Group was held, did not contain coercive words or terms that would call for mandatory attendance, still, the official suspension of classes to give way to the convocation tended to favor the Gamilla Group. For the convergence of the faculty members gave said group the "captive audience" and opportunity to conduct the ambush election of union officers, the prior scheduling by the incumbent Mariño group of a General Assembly for such election on October 5, 1996 notwithstanding,

*   **CBA Negotiations:** UST entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with the Gamilla Group, *before* the courts had definitively ruled on the validity of the Gamilla Group's election. The Mariño Group claimed this was ULP.
 * **Relevant Legal Principle:** "Art. 253. Duty to bargain collectively when there exists a collective bargaining agreement.-When there is a collective bargaining agreement, the duty to bargain collectively shall also mean that neither party shall terminate nor modify such agreement during its lifetime. However, either party can serve a written notice to terminate or modify the agreement at least sixty (60) days prior to its expiration date. It shall be the duty of both parties to keep the status quo and to continue in full force and effect the terms and conditions of the existing agreement during the 60-day period and/or until a new agreement is reached by the parties. (Emphasis supplied)"

*   **Office Padlocking:** UST's security officer was present when the Gamilla Group padlocked the USTFU office. The Mariño Group claimed this was ULP.
 * **Relevant Legal Principle:** "In light of all the foregoing, and applying the totality of conduct doctrine, I submit that respondents' acts --- issuing the assailed Memorandum, dealing with and entering into a CBA with the Gamilla Group despite knowledge of the pending questions on union leadership and the existence of CBA, and authorizing/allowing the presence of the Chief of Security during the padlocking of the USTFU premises and posting a guard thereat --- amount to interference under Article 248 (a) of the Labor Code which constitutes ULP."

*   **Burden of Proof:**  The Court emphasized that the burden of proving ULP lies with the party alleging it (USTFU).  Citing *De Paul/King Philip Customs Tailor v. NLRC* and *Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union (NUBE) v. Confesor*, the SC stated that substantial evidence is required, meaning such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.

**Key Arguments and Rationale:**

*   **Lack of Evidence:** The SC found the USTFU's evidence, including Yu's affidavit, Sibug's certification, and the photograph of the security guard, insufficient to prove ULP.  Yu's affidavit was criticized for containing legal conclusions rather than factual assertions.
*   **No Coercion:**  The UST memorandum regarding the convocation did not mandate attendance.
*   **Duty to Bargain:** UST was obligated to bargain with the USTFU, and, at the time, the Gamilla Group presented themselves as the duly elected officers.  UST's failure to negotiate with the group claiming to be the union representatives *could* have constituted ULP.
*   **Intra-Union Dispute:** The SC noted that the issue of the Gamilla Group's legitimacy was an intra-union dispute, and it was not UST's duty to inquire into the validity of the election.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 247 of the Labor Code:**  Concept of ULP.
*   **Article 248 of the Labor Code:** Unfair labor practices of employers, specifically paragraphs (a) (interference with self-organization) and (d) (domination or assistance of a labor organization).
*   **Article 248(g) of the Labor Code** To violate the duty to bargain collectively as prescribed by this Code.
*   **Article 250(a) of the Code:** Procedures in Collective Bargaining
*   **Article 252 of the Code:** Meaning of the duty to bargain collectively.
*   **Article 253 of the Labor Code:** Duty to bargain collectively when there exists a CBA

**Case Law:**

*   *De Paul/King Philip Customs Tailor v. NLRC*, G.R. No. 129824, March 10, 1999, 304 SCRA 448.
*   *Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union (NUBE) v. Confesor*, G.R. No. 114974, June 16, 2004, 432 SCRA 308.
*   *Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Employees Association - NATU v. Insular Life Assurance Co. Ltd.*, G.R. No. L-25291, January 30, 1971, 37 SCRA 244.
*   *Mariño, Jr. v. Gamilla*, G.R. No. 132400. January 31, 2005.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Totality of Conduct:** Although the SC found each individual action insufficient to prove ULP, the dissenting opinion argued for considering the "totality of conduct," suggesting a pattern of interference. This dissenting view highlights a potential weakness in the majority's reasoning.
*   **Balancing Duty to Bargain and Neutrality:**  The ruling acknowledges the employer's duty to bargain but may create uncertainty about how employers should act when faced with a contested union leadership, particularly while intra-union disputes are pending.  The employer needs to balance fulfilling its duty to bargain with remaining neutral and avoiding interference.
* **Reliance on Procedure:** The court places emphasis on the Mariño group properly informing the University of the dispute regarding the union leadership. The absence of evidence of these actions was used to find against the union's ULP claims. However, as pointed out in the dissent, the University should have been aware of the dispute because it was a necessary party to the action.

**Dissenting Opinion (Carpio Morales, J.):**

*   Argued that UST's actions, considered holistically, did constitute interference under Article 248(a) of the Labor Code.
*   Criticized the majority's focus on individual acts rather than the overall impact of UST's conduct.
*   Stressed that entering into a new CBA with the Gamilla Group while the old CBA was in effect and while the intra-union dispute was pending was a clear violation of Art. 253 of the Labor Code.
* Argued that the Court erred in placing the burden on the USTFU to inform the University of the dispute, because the University would have already been informed of the issue by the union's legal action.
