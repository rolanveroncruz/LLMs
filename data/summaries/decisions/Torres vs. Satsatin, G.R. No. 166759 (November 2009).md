## Legal Document Summary - *Torres v. Satsatin*, G.R. No. 166759

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that nullified Regional Trial Court (RTC) orders related to a Writ of Attachment.

**Facts:** The Torres siblings authorized Nicanor Satsatin to sell their land. Satsatin sold it to Solar Resources, Inc. but allegedly failed to remit the full proceeds. The Torreses sued Satsatin for the unremitted balance and obtained a Writ of Attachment against his properties.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Writ of Attachment Validity:**  The central issue is the validity of the Writ of Attachment issued by the RTC. The CA found grave abuse of discretion due to procedural defects.

*   **Surety Bond Sufficiency:** The CA held the surety bond supporting the Writ of Attachment was improperly issued. The bonding company's accreditation was limited to specific cities and didn't cover the RTC's jurisdiction (Dasmari√±as, Cavite).  Cites *Judicial Audit and Physical Inventory of Confiscated Cash, Surety and Property Bonds at RTC, Tarlac City, Brs. 63, 64 & 65, A.M. No. 04-7-358-RTC, July 22, 2005, 464 SCRA 21, 28*, which requires complete fulfillment of requisites for bond approval.

*   **Jurisdiction over Defendant:** The CA ruled the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the Satsatins when the Writ was implemented because summons was served *after* the attachment. This is a critical point.

*   **Service of Summons and Documents (Rule 57, Sec. 5):** The Supreme Court (SC) emphasized that service of summons, complaint, and other attachment-related documents must be done contemporaneously or before the implementation of the writ to bind the defendant, citing *Davao Light & Power Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 93262, November 29, 1991, 204 SCRA 343, 355-356* and *Cuartero v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 102448, August 5, 1992, 212 SCRA 260.*

*   **Grounds for Discharge of Attachment (Rule 57, Sec. 13):** The SC clarified that challenging the attachment based on *irregular issuance/service* is distinct from challenging it based on grounds that are the applicant's cause of action (e.g., fraud). The latter requires posting a counter-bond.

*   **Estoppel, Laches, and Prescription:**  The SC rejected the argument that the Respondents were estopped from challenging the writ due to delay or that the issue was mooted by renewal of the bond.

**Holding & Liabilities:**

*   The SC affirmed the CA decision. The Writ of Attachment was deemed invalid due to improper issuance and service. The attachment bond was issued by a bonding company without jurisdiction. The levy on the respondents' properties was lifted.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Damages:**  While not explicitly stated, the Torres siblings could potentially be liable for damages to the Satsatins due to the wrongful attachment, particularly if malice or bad faith is proven. The  petitioners have posted a bond to answer for all costs which may be adjudged to the respondents and all damages which respondents may sustain by reason of the attachment prayed for, if it shall be finally adjudged that petitioners are not entitled thereto.

*   **Reversal Potential:**  While unlikely given the SC's emphasis on procedural requirements for provisional remedies, the Torreses could attempt to pursue the underlying claim for the unremitted proceeds, possibly with a new, properly executed attachment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 57, Rules of Court (Preliminary Attachment)** - governs the issuance and implementation of Writs of Attachment. Sections 5, 12, and 13 are particularly relevant.
*   *FCY Construction Group, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (on counter-bonds vs. motions to dissolve)
*   *Davao Light & Power Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (on jurisdiction and service requirements)
*   *Cuartero v. Court of Appeals* (on the stages of attachment and jurisdictional requirements)
*   *Judicial Audit and Physical Inventory of Confiscated Cash, Surety and Property Bonds at RTC, Tarlac City, Brs. 63, 64 & 65, A.M. No. 04-7-358-RTC, July 22, 2005, 464 SCRA 21, 28* (On the requirements and compliance for Surety Bonds)

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly review the validity of any future attachment bonds, ensuring the bonding company is properly accredited in the relevant jurisdiction.
*   Strictly adhere to the procedural requirements for service of summons and other documents *prior* to or *simultaneously* with the implementation of a Writ of Attachment.
*   Consider potential liability for damages due to wrongful attachment.
