## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sandiganbayan and Sabio* (G.R. Nos. 228494-96, March 21, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging the Sandiganbayan's acquittal of Camilo Loyola Sabio on charges of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) and two counts of Malversation of Public Funds under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **RA 3019 Section 3(e):** Sabio allegedly caused undue injury to the government through evident bad faith by misappropriating/converting P10,350,000.00 from Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation (MPLDC) remittances intended for the Bureau of Treasury (BOT) as part of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) Fund.

*   **Revised Penal Code Article 217 (Malversation):**

    *   Count 1:  Sabio allegedly misappropriated/converted the same P10,350,000.00 from MPLDC remittances.
    *   Count 2: Sabio allegedly misappropriated/converted P1,555,862.03 in cash advances for litigation and travel expenses related to a trip to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

**Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Acquitted Sabio on all charges due to insufficiency of evidence engendering reasonable doubt.

**Petitioner's Argument:**

The Office of the Ombudsman alleges grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by the Sandiganbayan, arguing that the court:

1.  Capriciously ruled the MPLDC remittances were used/issued as cash advances.
2.  Acted without/in excess of jurisdiction in concluding there was no misappropriation/conversion of funds.
3.  Gravely abused discretion in finding insufficient evidence of misappropriation/conversion in all cases, especially considering Sabio's alleged failure to liquidate cash advances.

The Ombudsman argues this is not a case of double jeopardy since the acquittal was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.

**Respondent's Argument:**

Sabio claims the Ombudsman's petition violates his constitutional right against double jeopardy. He denies misappropriating funds and claims he endorsed checks for PCGG operational expenses. He argues the Sandiganbayan did not gravely abuse its discretion, and the acquittal was based on reasonable doubt.

**Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed the Petition, upholding Sabio's acquittal.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution, Section 21 (Double Jeopardy)**
*   **Rule 117, Section 7, Rules of Court on Criminal Procedure (Double Jeopardy)**
*   **People v. Hon. Tria-Tirona, 502 Phil. 31 (2005)** - Defines the limitation of review in certiorari proceeding.
*   **People v. Hon. Velasco, 394 Phil. 517 (2000)** - Explains the underlying principle behind the general rule of staying a judgment of acquittal.

**Rationale:**

The Court held that the Ombudsman's petition attempts to overturn the Sandiganbayan's decision based on perceived mistakes in the appreciation of facts and evidence, which does not fall within the scope of certiorari under Rule 65. Errors in the evaluation of evidence are errors of judgment, not errors of jurisdiction. The Court emphasized that the prosecution had ample opportunity to present evidence, and the Sandiganbayan's acquittal was based on an assessment of that evidence, finding reasonable doubt. The Court reiterated that certiorari does not correct errors of judgment, only errors of jurisdiction. Also reiterates that an acquittal is final and executory upon its promulgation.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The core legal issue is whether the Ombudsman's petition constitutes a violation of Sabio's right against double jeopardy.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The success of the petition hinged on proving that the Sandiganbayan's decision was rendered with grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Petitioner failed to meet the burden of proof that the Sandiganbayan blatantly abused its discretion.

**Note:** This is a concise summary. A complete legal analysis would require a review of the full court decision, transcripts of the Sandiganbayan proceedings, and relevant statutory provisions.
