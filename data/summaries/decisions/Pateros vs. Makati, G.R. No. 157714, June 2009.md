## Legal Document Summary: Municipality of Pateros v. Court of Appeals, Municipality of Makati, et al. (G.R. No. 157714, June 16, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal of Pateros' appeal for improper mode (Rule 45 vs. Rule 41).  The underlying dispute concerns the territorial boundary between Pateros and Makati, specifically portions of Fort Bonifacio (Brgys Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Comembo, Pembo, and Pitogo) claimed by both.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Proclamations 2475 & 518:** These presidential proclamations place the disputed area within Makati's jurisdiction. Pateros seeks their nullification.  *Legal Issue:* Validity of these proclamations, whether they constitute law requiring a plebiscite under Art. X, Secs. 10 & 11 of the 1987 Constitution.
*   **RTC Dismissal:** The RTC dismissed Pateros' complaint for lack of jurisdiction, citing *Municipality of Sogod v. Rosal* and holding that boundary alteration requires a law enacted by Congress and plebiscite approval. *Legal Issue:* Does the RTC have original jurisdiction to determine the boundary dispute, considering the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, and the subsequent conversion of Makati into a highly urbanized city?
*   **Mode of Appeal:** The CA dismissed Pateros' appeal because it raised a pure question of law (jurisdiction), requiring a direct appeal to the Supreme Court via Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari) instead of an ordinary appeal to the CA under Rule 41.
*   **Section 118 of the LGC**: lays out the jurisdictional responsibility for settlement of boundary disputes and outlines a step-by-step settlement that must take place before it is formally tried by the sanggunian.

**Obligations & Procedures Ordered by the Supreme Court:**

1.  The Supreme Court acknowledged Paterosâ€™ procedural infraction of an improper mode of appeal, but relaxed the rules in the interest of justice.
2.  The Supreme Court directed Pateros and Makati to comply with Section 118(d) and (e) of the LGC (amicable settlement via their respective sanggunians).
3.  The court states that judicial recourse, as provided in the LGC, may follow if amicable settlement is not reached.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Compliance Issues:**  The LGC outlines specific procedures and timelines for the *Sangguniang's* actions. Failure to adhere to these timelines or procedures could introduce further legal challenges.
*   **Political Considerations:**  Amicable settlement often involves political negotiation.  The process could be complicated by existing tensions and political dynamics between the LGUs.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:** While no evidence was presented in RTC, dispute likely involves conflicting historical documents, maps, and resident testimonies regarding territorial claims. This can prolong resolution even at *Sangguniang* level.
* **Legislation**: The Supreme Court feels obliged to inform Congress of the need to pass a law specifically delineating the metes and bounds of the disputing LGUs to put an end to the dispute

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. X, Secs. 10 & 11, 1987 Constitution:** Governs the creation, division, merger, abolition, or substantial alteration of LGU boundaries, requiring a law and plebiscite.
*   **Section 118 of the LGC**: lays out the jurisdictional responsibility for settlement of boundary disputes and outlines a step-by-step settlement that must take place before it is formally tried by the sanggunian.
*   **Rule 41 & 45, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Differentiate between appeals to the CA (mixed questions of fact and law) and direct appeals to the SC (pure questions of law).
*   ***Municipality of Sogod v. Rosal* (G.R. Nos. 38204 and 38205, September 24, 1991):** Addressed modification of boundaries requiring congressional action
*   ***National Housing Authority v. Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems* (G.R. No. 142601, October 23, 2006):** Addressed jurisdiction of RTC over boundary disputes among LGUs
*   ***Municipality of Kananga v. Judge Madrona* (450 Phil. 392, 2003):** Clarified jurisdiction of RTC over boundary disputes among LGUs
*   ***Mariano, Jr. v. COMELEC* (312 Phil. 259, 1995):** Addressed need for a law to specifically delineate the metes and bounds of the disputing LGUs

**Legal Advice:**

Advise Pateros to prioritize amicable settlement negotiations with Makati *Sangguniang*, focusing on presenting compelling evidence supporting its historical territorial claims. Simultaneously, prepare for potential formal trial within the *Sangguniang*, gathering relevant documents and resident testimonies. Closely monitor compliance with LGC procedural requirements to avoid procedural pitfalls. Congress should delineate the metes and bounds of the disputing LGUs to put an end to the dispute
