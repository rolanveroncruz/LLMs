**Case Summary: People v. Cuevas, G.R. No. 238906 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165.

**Key Provisions and Elements:**

*   **Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Sec. 5, RA 9165):** Established elements of sale, including the identity of the buyer and seller (SPO1 Andulay and Cuevas), the object (shabu), consideration (payment), and delivery.
*   **Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (Sec. 11, RA 9165):** Established elements of possession: Cuevas possessed a prohibited drug (shabu) without legal authorization, and he freely and consciously possessed it.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, RA 9165):**  The court found substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule. Marking was done immediately after seizure, even if at the nearest police station. Inventory and photography conducted at the barangay hall in the presence of an elected public official, DOJ representative, and media representative. Items were then transported to the crime lab and identified in court.

**Facts:**

*   Buy-bust operation conducted by PNP-IB-LPPO and PDEA.
*   Cuevas allegedly sold 0.04 gram of shabu to a poseur-buyer.
*   Search incidental to arrest yielded two additional sachets of shabu (0.17 gram total) and drug paraphernalia.
*   Inventory and photography conducted at barangay hall with required witnesses present (Barangay Councilor, DOJ representative, and Media representative).
*   Items tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   Accused denied charges, claiming framing and illegal search.

**Holding:**

*   CA affirmed RTC conviction; Supreme Court affirmed CA decision.
*   Cuevas found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.
*   Life imprisonment and P500,000 fine for Illegal Sale.
*   12 years and 1 day to 14 years imprisonment and P300,000 fine for Illegal Possession.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   Potential challenges existed regarding strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165, specifically regarding immediate marking at the arrest site. However, the court applied the doctrine of substantial compliance, considering marking at the nearest police station acceptable.
*   Defense arguments regarding framing and illegal search were insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence of a legitimate buy-bust operation.
*   The case hinges on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the evidentiary weight given to the buy-bust operation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision references numerous cases related to the elements of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs and the chain of custody rule, including *People v. Crispo*, *People v. Sanchez*, *People v. Magsano*, *People v. Manansala*, *People v. Miranda*, *People v. Mamangon*.
*   Cites *People v. Mamalumpon* and *Imson v. People* regarding the timing of the marking of seized items.

**Conclusion:**

The prosecution successfully established the elements of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, and the Court found substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule despite potential deviations. The conviction was upheld based on the established factual findings and the court's assessment of witness credibility.
