## Legal Document Summary: People v. Umadhay, G.R. No. 119544 (1998)

**Type:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court decision finding Edgar, Sergio, and Albert Umadhay guilty of murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Murder under the Revised Penal Code (Art. 248), qualified by treachery and evident premeditation for the killing of Gonzalo Jaranilla III.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty beyond reasonable doubt; sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay P50,000 civil indemnity and P22,711 actual damages, with cost of suit.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Accused Appellants (Edgar, Sergio, Albert Umadhay):** Found jointly and severally liable for civil indemnity and actual damages, as well as facing imprisonment of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dying Declaration:** Appellants contest the admissibility and weight of the victim's dying declaration, arguing his injuries rendered him unable to speak intelligently. **(Relevant Case Law:** The admissibility hinges on meeting the five requisites as discussed in the text. The victim's consciousness and ability to communicate were challenged.)
*   **Self-Defense (Edgar Umadhay):** Edgar claims self-defense, shifting the burden of proof to him. This claim is undermined by inconsistencies in his testimony, the number of wounds inflicted on the victim, and his flight from the scene. **(Statutory Reference:** The burden of proof relies on Uribi, 182 SCRA 624, 639 (1990)).
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Appellants argue mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, deemed irrelevant because the arrest of the offenders had been completed by the police before they were able to voluntarily surrender. **(Relevant Case Law:** Elements of surrender under People v. Amaguin, (G.R. Nos. 54344-45, January 10, 1994, 299 SCRA 166) not met; spontaneity absent.
*   **Credibility of Witness (Cecilia Jaranilla):** Appellants attempt to discredit the testimony of the victim's wife, Cecilia, who witnessed the shooting. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's assessment of her straightforward and convincing account.
*   **Conspiracy:** The prosecution alleges conspiracy, with the SC ruling that not all must have killed the victim, but the accused all had a common purpose for killing the victim.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Padao, 267 SCRA 64, 73 (1997):** Requisites for dying declaration.
*   **People v. Apa-ap, Jr., 235 SCRA 468 (1994):** Supports the validity of the dying declaration given circumstances of the death.
*   **People v. Uribi, 182 SCRA 624, 639 (1990):** Burden of proof shifts to accused claiming self-defense.
*   **People v. Amaguin, G.R. Nos. 54344-45, January 10, 1994, 299 SCRA 166:** Elements of voluntary surrender.
*   **People v. Morin:** Pure emanations of the incident.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no specific "clauses" in this Supreme Court decision. The contentious points lie within the arguments presented by the appellants, specifically surrounding the factual circumstances of the shooting, the admissibility of evidence, and the application of mitigating circumstances.

**Overall:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's decision, finding the Umadhay brothers guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder. The appeal hinged on challenging the evidence presented, particularly the dying declaration, and claiming self-defense and voluntary surrender. The SC rejected these arguments, upholding the credibility of the eyewitness testimony and the presence of treachery.
