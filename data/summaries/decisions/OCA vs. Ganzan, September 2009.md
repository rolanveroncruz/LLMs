**Summary of A.M. No. P-05-2046 (Formerly No. 05-6-159-MCTC)**

This administrative case concerns Clerk of Court II Fe P. Ganzan, MCTC, Jasaan-Claveria, Misamis Oriental, stemming from an OCA audit report dated June 15, 2005, covering her accountability from July 1994 to February 28, 2005.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Shortages:** The audit revealed shortages totaling P256,530.25 across various funds (Special Allowance for the Judiciary, General Fund, Judiciary Development Fund, Fiduciary Fund).
*   **Uncollected Fines:** Uncollected/unreported fines amounted to P50,050.00.
*   **Missing Receipts:** Numerous official receipts were missing and unaccounted for.
*   **Failure to Comply with Directives:** Ganzan failed to comply with repeated directives from the Supreme Court to explain the shortages, account for the missing receipts, and submit supporting documentation. This includes multiple resolutions, show cause orders, and fines for non-compliance.
*   **Preventive Suspension:** Ganzan had been under preventive suspension since July 2005.
*   **OCA Recommendations:** The OCA recommended dismissal, restitution of shortages, payment of fines, application of benefits to shortages, and criminal prosecution.

**Obligations:**

*   **Restitution:** Ganzan is obligated to restitute P256,530.25 (shortages) + P50,050.00 (uncollected fines).
*   **Payment of Fines:** Ganzan must pay fines of P500.00 and P1,000.00.
*   Former officer must deposit/transfer all fund collections to the proper accounts, as stipulated in SC Circular No. 50-95.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found GUILTY of gross dishonesty and grave misconduct.
*   **Penalty:** DISMISSAL from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), and disqualification from re-employment in government service. Civil Service eligibility cancelled.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** OCA to coordinate with prosecution for filing appropriate criminal charges.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** Possible charges related to misappropriation of public funds.  *Office of the Court Administrator v. Besa, 437 Phil. 372, 380 (2002).* dictates that the failure of an officer to remit funds, as demanded by an authorized officer, is prima facie evidence of personal use.
*   **Asset Seizure:** Potential for seizure of assets to recover the shortages.
*   **Damage to Reputation:** Significant reputational damage due to finding of dishonesty and misconduct.

*   *Re: Report on the Judicial and Financial Audit of RTC-Br. 4, Panabo, Davao del Norte, 351 Phil. 1, 20 (1998).*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the document clearly outlines the shortages, the "cash bonds of undetermined amount on cases enumerated in Annex 'E'" introduces ambiguity. The lack of a specific amount makes restitution related to this item difficult to enforce.
*   The order to apply Ganzan's benefits to the shortages is subject to computation by the Fiscal Management Office, and the application order (Fiduciary Fund, JDF, etc.) could be challenged depending on the legal priority of claims.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court found Ganzan guilty of grave violations with significant financial implications. Her persistent refusal to cooperate and account for the missing funds and receipts greatly contributed to the severe penalty imposed. This document establishes a strong case against her for both administrative and potential criminal liability.
