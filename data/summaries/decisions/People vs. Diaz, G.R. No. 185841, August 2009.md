**Case Summary: *People v. Diaz*, G.R. No. 185841 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of accused-appellants Ismael Diaz and Rodolfo Diaz for two counts of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by RA 7659.

**Facts:** Ismael Diaz and Rodolfo Diaz were convicted of the murders of Elmer Quinto and SPO1 Richard Dalioan. The prosecution's case rested primarily on the eyewitness testimonies of Ernesto Decano and Arnel Quinto, who identified the Diaz brothers as the perpetrators. The RTC and CA found the testimonies credible, establishing that Ismael Diaz shot Quinto and Rodolfo Diaz shot Dalioan during a public event. A motive was established: Quinto was allegedly involved in the death of the Diaz brothers' relative, Pablo Diaz. The Diaz brothers claimed they were present but not involved, asserting mistaken identity and denial of the crime.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Murder (Art. 248, RPC):** Conviction upheld based on positive eyewitness identification and established conspiracy and treachery.
*   **Conspiracy:**  Evidence of conspiracy derived from the Diaz brothers' coordinated actions: Ismael Diaz positioned himself behind Quinto and Rodolfo Diaz behind Dalioan; they simultaneously fired upon the victims and fled together. (See People v. Ave, 439 Phil. 829, 853 (2002))
*   **Treachery:**  Qualifying circumstance of treachery was properly applied because the victims had no chance to defend themselves against the unexpected and swift attack from behind.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  Courts gave greater weight to the testimonies of the prosecution's eyewitnesses and credibility was not affected because different people react differently to a given situation.
*   **Defense of Denial:** Given no strong rebuttal evidence and prosecution witnesses clearly identified the two accused, the courts gave greater weight to prosecution testimonies.
*   **Flight:**  The Diaz brothers' flight after the incident and subsequent arrest two years later was considered evidence of guilt.

**Damages Modified:**

*   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000.00 for each death (affirmed).
*   **Actual Damages:** Denied (no proof).
*   **Temperate Damages:** To be awarded to families of each victim when no evidence of burial and funeral expenses is presented. Reduced to P25,000.00 for Quinto's heirs. Retained for Dalioan's heirs
*   **Moral Damages:** Increased to P50,000.00 for each victim (to conform with jurisprudence).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded P25,000.00 to the heirs of each victim due to the presence of treachery and pursuant to Art. 2230 of Civil Code.
*   **Lost Earnings:** Increased to P2,474,868.00 and P896,000.00 respectively after applying the formula for unearned income.
*   **Legal Basis for Damages:** Civil Code Articles 2206, 2224, 2229, 2230.

**Penalties:**  Reclusion Perpetua for each count of murder (affirmed).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:**  The defense contested the credibility of Decano and Quinto's testimonies, citing potential obstructions to their line of sight and their admitted actions of taking cover. While the courts found their testimonies credible, this remains a potential point of contention.
*   **Proof of Conspiracy:** There was no direct evidence of conspiracy, but the court inferred conspiracy based on the defendants' actions. The defense may argue that the circumstances were not conclusive enough to prove conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Assessment of witness credibility is typically a factual matter best left to the trial court because it is in the best position to assess credibility of the witnesses because it is in the best position to observe them.
*   **Calculating lost earnings of the victims using prescribed formula in similar cases.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Art. 248 (Murder)
*   Republic Act No. 7659 (Amending the RPC regarding heinous crimes)
*   Civil Code Articles 2206, 2224, 2229, 2230.

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mateo*, G.R. Nos. 147678-87 (2004) â€“ Regarding transfer of cases to the Court of Appeals
*   People v. Jabiniao, Jr., G.R. No. 179499 (2008), computation of victim's gross earnings.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Ismael and Rodolfo Diaz, modifying only the damages awarded. The prosecution successfully proved murder beyond a reasonable doubt, establishing conspiracy and treachery. Despite the defense's challenges to eyewitness credibility, the courts found their testimonies convincing.
