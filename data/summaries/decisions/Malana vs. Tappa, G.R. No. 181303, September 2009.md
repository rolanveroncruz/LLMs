Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Carmen Danao Malana, et al. v. Benigno Tappa, et al.* G.R. No. 181303, September 17, 2009

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing RTC Orders dismissing a complaint for *reivindicacion*, quieting of title, and damages for lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Malana et al.) filed a complaint in the RTC alleging ownership of land covered by TCT No. T-127937, inherited from Anastacio Danao.
*   Respondents (Tappa et al.) are family members of Consuelo Pauig, who was previously allowed by Anastacio to build on the land with an agreement to vacate when needed.
*   Respondents refused to vacate and claimed ownership, presenting allegedly dubious documents that created a cloud on Petitioners' title.
*   The assessed value of the property was P410.00.
*   RTC dismissed the case *motu proprio*, citing lack of jurisdiction because the assessed value was below the jurisdictional threshold of P20,000.00 for RTCs in real actions, per R.A. 7691 amending B.P. 129.
*   Petitioners argued their primary cause of action was quieting of title, which they believed fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC per Rule 63 of the Rules of Court, and that joinder with *reivindicacion* was permissible.
*   RTC denied reconsideration, holding that actions to quiet title were real actions subject to the jurisdictional amount requirements of R.A. 7691, and clarified that the dismissal was not for misjoinder, but lack of jurisdiction.

**Issue:**

Did the RTC commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's dismissal.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Jurisdiction Over Real Actions:** The Court distinguished between the general declaratory relief provisions in Rule 63, Section 1, paragraph 1 (within RTC jurisdiction) and the specific actions in paragraph 2 (reformation, quieting of title, consolidation).  While Rule 63 states quieting of title actions "may" be brought under that rule, it does not confer exclusive jurisdiction to the RTC. This is contrasted with the mandatory language of R.A. 7691, which vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the MTC for civil actions involving title to or possession of real property where the assessed value does not exceed P20,000.00. Since the assessed value was P410.00, the MTC had exclusive jurisdiction.
*   **Declaratory Relief vs. Other Actions:** An action for declaratory relief is appropriate only *before* a breach of rights. Here, the Petitioners had already demanded that the Respondents vacate the property and were refused, demonstrating that the proper actions would be an *accion publiciana* or *accion reivindicatoria*, not declaratory relief/quieting of title. The court emphasized that the remedy of declaratory relief is for ending controversies *before* repudiation of obligations or invasion of rights.
*  **Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by silence, waiver, or consent.** If the court has no jurisdiction over an action, it may dismiss *motu proprio*.

**Relevant Laws/Rules:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7691:** Amends Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), defining jurisdiction of RTC and MTC. Specifically, Section 33 which dictates MTC jurisdiction over real actions where assessed value does not exceed â‚±20,000 (outside Metro Manila).
*   **Rule 63, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** Deals with actions for declaratory relief, reformation of instruments, quieting of title, etc.  Specifically, the second paragraph and its interaction with jurisdictional statutes.
*   **Articles 476-481, Civil Code:** Relate to actions to quiet title.
*   **Articles 1359-1369, Civil Code:** Relate to actions for reformation of instruments.
*  **Article 1607, Civil Code:** Relate to actions to consolidate ownership.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Misjoinder of Causes of Action:** While not the basis of the dismissal, Petitioners' attempt to combine *reivindicacion* (a cause of action involving a prior breach/deprivation of possession) with quieting of title (a remedy akin to declaratory relief, typically sought *before* a breach) was problematic.
*   **Jurisdictional Amount:** Litigants must be careful to accurately assess the value of the property to determine the proper court.
*   **Choice of Remedy:** The case highlights the importance of choosing the correct legal remedy based on the factual circumstances (i.e., whether a breach has already occurred). Here, Petitioners' reliance on quieting of title was misplaced given the existing dispute over possession.
*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** If the case is refiled in the MTC as a *reivindicatoria*, prior findings may have a preclusive effect.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses (if any):**

*   **Interpretation of Rule 63, Section 1:** The central dispute hinged on whether the second paragraph of this provision independently conferred jurisdiction on the RTC for actions to quiet title, regardless of the jurisdictional amount. The Supreme Court clarified that it did not.
