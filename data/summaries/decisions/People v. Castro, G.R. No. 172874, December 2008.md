## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Castro*, G.R. No. 172874

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for rape.

**Issue:** Whether the accused-appellant, Mario Castro, is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision finding Castro guilty of simple rape. He was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay P50,000 in civil indemnity and P50,000 in moral damages to the victim.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Rape Defined:** The court reiterated that even slight penetration of the male organ into the female sex organ is sufficient to consummate rape.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court gave great weight to the testimony of the victim and was deemed consistent, spontaneous, and straight forward.
*   **Medical Examination Not Indispensable:** A medical examination is not indispensable for rape conviction, the victim's testimony is sufficient if credible.
*   **Defense of Alibi Rejected:** The alibi was rejected because the defense failed to prove the physical impossibility of the accused being at the crime scene.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-appellant is obligated to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the victim totaling P100,000.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-appellant is criminally liable for the crime of simple rape.
*   Accused-appellant is civilly liable for damages sustained by the victim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Defective Information:** The information was deemed defective because it did not specifically allege that the accused was a relative by affinity within the third civil degree.
*   **Sentencing and Qualified Rape:** Although the facts supported a conviction for qualified rape under Article 266-B due to the victim's age (14) and the accused's relationship as her brother-in-law, the defective information led to a conviction for simple rape and a sentence of *reclusion perpetua* instead of the death penalty.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** Witness testimony is central to the case, any challenge to her credibility could provide avenues of appeal.
