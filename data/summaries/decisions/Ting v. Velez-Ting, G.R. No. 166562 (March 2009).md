**Case:** *Benjamin G. Ting vs. Carmen M. Velez-Ting*, G.R. No. 166562, March 31, 2009 (601 Phil. 676)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Amended Decision affirming RTC Decision declaring marriage null and void ab initio under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Petition for Nullity:** Respondent (Carmen) filed for declaration of nullity under Article 36 of the Family Code, alleging Petitioner's (Benjamin's) psychological incapacity at the time of marriage, manifesting later as alcoholism, violence, compulsive gambling, irresponsibility and failure to provide financial support.
*   **Expert Testimony:** Conflicting expert psychiatric testimonies presented. Respondent presented Dr. Oñate who, based solely on a deposition transcript, diagnosed Petitioner with a personality disorder manifesting in compulsive drinking, gambling and abuse. Petitioner presented Dr. Obra who, after reviewing the deposition transcript, a report from a South African psychiatrist who examined Petitioner, and interviews with Petitioner's brothers, concluded that there was nothing wrong with the petitioner's personality.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** RTC found Petitioner psychologically incapacitated based on Dr. Oñate's testimony and Petitioner's admissions. The CA initially reversed the RTC decision but then reversed again, affirming the RTC.
*   **Issue on Stare Decisis:** Petitioner claims the CA violated the rule on stare decisis by disregarding the guidelines in *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (240 SCRA 20) and *Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina* (335 Phil. 664).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA and RTC, finding insufficient evidence to prove Petitioner's psychological incapacity under Article 36.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Obligations of Marriage:** Focus is on Petitioner's alleged failure to comply with the essential marital obligations due to psychological incapacity (Art. 36, Family Code).
*   **Presumption of Validity:** Marriage presumed valid; burden of proof rests on the party seeking nullity.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Application of *Molina* Guidelines:** The Court acknowledges the potential for overly rigid application of the *Molina* guidelines, emphasizing a case-by-case approach, while affirming its validity. *Edward Kenneth Ngo Te v. Rowena Ong Gutierrez Yu-Te*, G.R. No. 161793, February 13, 2009, reiterates that *Molina* is not abandoned but its requirements should be relaxed.
*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The Court found the conflicting psychiatric evaluations inconclusive and the other evidence (e.g., drinking, gambling) insufficient to establish psychological incapacity *at the time of the marriage*. This underscores the high evidentiary burden to prove psychological incapacity under Art. 36. Expert opinion should be decisive but not indispensable evidence.
*   **Psychological Incapacity Definition:** Court reiterates that Art. 36 is reserved for the "most serious cases of personality disorders" demonstrating an "utter insensitivity or inability" to give meaning to the marriage. It must be a malady so grave and permanent as to deprive one of awareness of the duties and responsibilities of the matrimonial bond he or she is about to assume.
*   **Subjective Interpretation:** The application of Art. 36 remains subject to judicial interpretation, requiring a nuanced analysis of the facts in each case.
*   **Stare Decisis:** Although raised, the court asserts that the principle of stare decisis does not rigidly bind it, especially when adherence to prior rulings perpetuates illegitimacy or fails to accommodate societal changes, while ultimately upholding *Molina*.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Article 36 of the Family Code
*   *Santos v. Court of Appeals*, 240 SCRA 20
*   *Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina*, 335 Phil. 664
*   *Pesca v. Pesca*, 408 Phil. 713

*   Article 8 of the Civil Code

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling due to a lack of convincing evidence demonstrating that the Petitioner's psychological issues existed at the time of marriage and were severe enough to render him incapable of fulfilling the essential obligations of marriage, while upholding the core principles of *Molina*.
