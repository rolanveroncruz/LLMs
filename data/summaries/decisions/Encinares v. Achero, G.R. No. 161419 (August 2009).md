## Legal Document Summary - *Encinares v. Achero*

**Case:** *Eugenio Encinares v. Dominga Achero*, G.R. No. 161419, August 25, 2009 (613 Phil. 391)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's decision, involving a Complaint for Quieting of Title and Reconveyance.

**Key Issue:** Determining which party, Encinares (Petitioner) or Achero (Respondent), has a better right over the subject property, Lot No. 1623, in Juban, Sorsogon.

**Background:**

*   Petitioner claims ownership based on a Deed of Absolute Sale from Roger Lim, tracing back to prior possessors. Claims continuous possession for over 30 years.
*   Respondent holds OCT No. P-23505 under a Free Patent, claiming occupation and cultivation since 1928 by her predecessor-in-interest.
*   Petitioner alleges fraud in Respondent's acquisition of the Free Patent and registration, encompassing a portion of his land.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DENIED the petition and AFFIRMED the Court of Appeals decision upholding the validity of OCT No. P-23505 in favor of the respondent.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Quieting of Title and Reconveyance based on prior possession, equitable title, and alleged fraud in Respondent's free patent application.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Validity of OCT No. P-23505; denial of fraud; reliance on the indefeasibility of title after one year (Section 32, P.D. No. 1529, The Property Registration Decree), and presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner:** Failed to prove actual and extrinsic fraud in the Free Patent acquisition. Reliance on tax declarations insufficient to prove ownership without accompanying possession for required prescriptive period.
*   **Respondent:** Maintains ownership as titleholder. Risk is limited given the SC decision.
*   **General Risk:**  The case underscores the importance of timely opposition to Free Patent applications and the difficulty in overturning a title based on allegations of fraud without clear and convincing evidence, especially after one year from issuance of OCT No. P-23505.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529 (The Property Registration Decree), Section 32:**  Incontestability of title after one year, subject to actions based on actual fraud.
*   **Commonwealth Act 141 (The Public Land Act), Section 48(b) amended by P.D. No. 1073**: Requirements for confirmation of title based on possession and occupation of public agricultural land.
*   **Republic v. Guerrero, G.R. No. 133168, March 28, 2006:** Defines "actual" and "constructive" fraud, as well as "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" fraud. Only actual and extrinsic fraud can be grounds for reopening a decree.
*   **Rabaja Ranch Development Corporation v. AFP Retirement and Separation Benefits System, G.R. No. 177181, July 7, 2009:**  Highlights that torrens system is not a mode of acquiring titles to lands but a system of registration of titles to lands
*   **General Principles:** Presumption of regularity in performance of official functions; Tax declarations as indicia of possession but insufficient for ownership without prescription.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Fraud Allegation:**  Petitioner alleged fraud but failed to provide sufficient evidence. The SC emphasized the need for "actual and extrinsic fraud," which involves depriving a party of their day in court.
*   **Extent of Possession:** Dispute existed regarding the duration and nature of possession of both parties.
* **Award of Land by RTC:** The RTC erroneously awarded 19,290 sq. m. to petitioner while the Deed of Absolute Sale stated only 16,826 sq. m.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the CA's decision, reinforcing the indefeasibility of titles acquired under the Torrens system in the absence of compelling evidence of actual and extrinsic fraud. The petitioner's reliance on tax declarations and prior possession was insufficient to overcome the Respondent's registered title. This case highlights the evidentiary burden in actions for reconveyance and the importance of timely challenging Free Patent applications. The court emphasized it would not consider the case based on alleged fraud and it considered Rabaja Ranch doctrine citing the importance of justice and equity when it comes to the integrity of the torrens system.
