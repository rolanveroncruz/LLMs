**Case Summary: Fenix (CEZA) International, Inc. v. Hon. Executive Secretary, et al. (G.R. No. 235258)**

**Citation:** 838 Phil. 344 (2018)

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the dismissal of Fenix (CEZA)'s indirect contempt petition against government respondents based on res judicata and forum shopping.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision, holding that *res judicata* and forum shopping do not apply. The case was remanded to the RTC for further proceedings on the contempt charge.

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **EO 156 (2002):** Banned importation of used motor vehicles, upheld in *Hon. Executive Secretary v. Southwing Heavy Industries, Inc.*, 518 Phil. 103 (2006), except within the fenced-in Subic Naval Base area. *Southwing* established the validity of EO 156 under police power.
*   **EO 418 (2005):** Imposed a specific duty of P500,000 on imported used motor vehicles in addition to regular duties.
*   **Fenix Case (RTC Decision, affirmed by SC):** Fenix successfully challenged the constitutionality of Section 2 of EO 418 as an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority. The RTC issued a Writ of Execution against the respondents.
*   **Forerunner Case (*Executive Secretary v. Forerunner Multi Resources, Inc.*, 701 Phil. 64 (2013)):** The SC held that EO 156 remained valid and was not repealed by EO 418. It also clarified that the *Fenix Case* decision did not reverse the *Southwing* ruling.
*   **Contempt Case (S.C.A. No. II-5557):** Fenix filed an indirect contempt petition, alleging that the BOC's subsequent disallowance of its used motor vehicle importations violated the Writ of Execution in the *Fenix Case*.

**Arguments of the Parties:**

*   **Petitioner (Fenix):** The BOC's actions violated the Writ of Execution from the *Fenix Case*.
*   **Respondents (Government):** The Contempt Case is barred by *res judicata* due to *Southwing* and *Forerunner*. Fenix is allegedly forum shopping. The RTC judgment only applied to Section 2 of EO 418, not EO 156.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **No Res Judicata:** The Court found that the cases involved different issues and causes of action.
    *   *Southwing* and *Forerunner* concerned the validity of EO 156.
    *   The *Fenix Case* concerned the validity of EO 418.
    *   The Contempt Case focused solely on whether respondents violated the Writ of Execution issued in the *Fenix Case* pertaining to the nullification of Section 2 of EO 418.
*   **No Forum Shopping:** Because *res judicata* does not apply, forum shopping is also absent.
*   The court applied Spouses Ocampo v. Heirs of Dionisio (744 Phil. 716, 726-727 (2014) to distinguish between bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment.
*   The court held that the test for forum shopping is whether the elements of lis pendens are present or whether a final judgment amounts to res judicata. Heirs of Sotto v. Palicte, 726 Phil. 651 (2014).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of the Writ of Execution:** The critical issue on remand is the precise scope of the Writ of Execution issued in the *Fenix Case*. Did the Writ merely prohibit enforcement of Section 2 of EO 418, or did it extend to actions by the BOC that, in effect, nullified the nullification of Section 2 of EO 418? If the writ only applied to Section 2 of EO 418, than the BOC had no legal reason not to enforce EO 156,
*   **Interpretation of EO 156 and EO 418:** The relationship between EO 156 and EO 418 remains complex. While EO 418 did not expressly repeal EO 156, a potential argument exists that it implicitly modified EO 156 by setting a specific duty for used motor vehicles, suggesting that importing of used motor vehicles could be done legally provided that the fees were paid. This argument was rejected in Executive Secretary v. Forerunner Multi Resources, Inc (701 Phil. 64 (2013)).
*   **Practical Effect of SC Ruling:** While Fenix won the appeal, the practical benefit depends on the interpretation of the Writ of Execution and the Court's view of the validity and applicability of EO 156. The court previously determined EO 156 to be valid under Southwing.
