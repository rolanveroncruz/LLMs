## Legal Document Summary: Enrile v. Sandiganbayan & People (G.R. No. 258841)

**Nature:** Decision on a Petition for Prohibition filed by Juan Ponce Enrile seeking to enjoin the Sandiganbayan from proceeding with a Plunder case (SB-14-CRM-0238) and to dismiss said case.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Enrile is accused of Plunder (amassing ill-gotten wealth of at least PHP 172,834,500.00) through kickbacks from his PDAF (Priority Development Assistance Fund), allegedly in conspiracy with Janet Lim Napoles and others.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Enrile argues the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion by:
    *   Refusing to include the Court's Bill of Particulars Decision and the prosecution's Bill of Particulars in the Pre-Trial Order.
    *   Allowing the prosecution to present evidence beyond the overt acts specified in the Bill of Particulars, violating his constitutional rights to be informed of the charges and to a speedy trial.
    *   Crafting a broad issue in the Pre-Trial Order ("whether the accused is guilty of Plunder") that undermines the purpose of the Bill of Particulars.
*   **Respondent's Argument (People):**
    *   Petition was filed out of time. The 60-day period should be reckoned from the denial of the first Motion for Reconsideration on the matter.
    *   Enrile has other remedies (objection to evidence, demurrer to evidence, appeal).
    *   Sandiganbayan did not act with grave abuse of discretion; the Bill of Particulars is part of the record, and the Pre-Trial Order's broad issue encompasses the elements of Plunder.
    *   The Bill of Particulars supplements the original information but does not limit the prosecution's evidence.

**Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED Enrile's Petition for Prohibition.

**Rationale:**

*   **Procedural Defects:**
    *   The Petition was filed out of time. The Court applied the doctrine in *San Juan, Jr. v. Cruz* (529 Phil. 402 (2006)), stating that when multiple motions for reconsideration are filed raising the same arguments, the 60-day period for filing a Rule 65 petition runs from the denial of the *first* motion for reconsideration, not the last.  The Court noted Enrile first raised these points in the Omnibus Motion and in the Motion for Inclusion.
    *   Enrile has plain, adequate, and speedy remedies in the ordinary course of law (objections to evidence, appeal).
*   **Substantive Issues:**
    *   The Sandiganbayan did *not* disregard the Court's Bill of Particulars Decision. There is no requirement to include the Bill of Particulars Decision or the Bill of Particulars itself in the Pre-Trial Order.
    *   The prosecution's evidence is *not* limited to matters in the Bill of Particulars. The Bill of Particulars supplements the Information by providing details, but it does not constitute a comprehensive list of all admissible evidence. Relevance is the test of admissibility, and the Bill of Particulars aids in determining relevance.
    *   Limiting the prosecution's evidence would prevent the prosecution from determining what evidence should be presented when, and for what purpose.
    *   The Court stated that to limit the prosecution to the presentation only of evidence mentioned in the Information and the Bill of Particulars would be to shackle and tie its hands and deprive it of the free exercise of its discretion to determine who and what to present.
    *   Enrile's constitutional rights were not violated as the Sandiganbayan acted in accordance with law and jurisprudence.

**Potential Risks/Concerns:**

*   **Evidentiary Disputes:** The breadth of admissible evidence could lead to extensive litigation on relevance and materiality, potentially delaying the trial.
*   **Conspiracy:** the Court does not require particulars on other individuals who gave kickbacks to Enrile.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *San Juan, Jr. v. Cruz*, 529 Phil. 402 (2006): Timeliness of petitions for certiorari assailing interlocutory orders.
*   *Enrile v. People*, 766 Phil. 75 (2015) - The original Bill of Particulars Decision.
*   *Virata v. Sandiganbayan*, 293 Phil. 55 (1993):  Function of a bill of particulars.
