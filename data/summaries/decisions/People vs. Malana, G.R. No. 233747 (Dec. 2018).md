**Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Nila Malana y Sambolledo*, G.R. No. 233747, December 05, 2018**

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA Decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, specifically selling 0.02 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Elements of the Crime:** The prosecution must prove (1) identity of buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (2) delivery and payment. *People v. Opiana*, 750 Phil. 140, 147 (2015). Critically, the prosecution must also prove *corpus delicti* (the dangerous drug itself). *People v. Guzon*, 719 Phil. 441, 451 (2013).
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** This section mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of:
    *   The accused or their representative/counsel.
    *   An elected public official.
    *   A representative from the media.
    *   A representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ).
    All required to sign the inventory.

**Liabilities:**

*   The RTC sentenced Malana to life imprisonment and a fine of Php500,000.00. This was based on finding her guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of violating Section 5 of Article II of R.A. 9165.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  The Supreme Court (SC) found a failure to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165. Crucially, two of the three required witnesses (DOJ representative and media representative) were absent during the inventory, and the prosecution failed to justify this absence. *People v. Tomawis*, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The lower courts erroneously relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty of the police officers. The SC emphasized this cannot override the presumption of innocence. *People v. Catalan*, 699 Phil. 603 (2012).
*   **Deviation from Internal Procedures:**  The police failed to follow their own Drug Enforcement Manual procedures for buy-bust operations (PNPM-D-O-3-1-99), further undermining the reliability of the operation.
*   **Weak Defense is Irrelevant:** The SC reiterates that the weakness of the accused's defense is irrelevant if the prosecution fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  The governing statute.
*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165:** Procedures for handling seized drugs.
*   **People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018:**  Elaborates on the purpose of requiring the presence of witnesses during inventory and seizure.
*   **People v. Catalan, 699 Phil. 603 (2012):**  Reiterates that the presumption of regularity cannot override the presumption of innocence.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018:** Discusses acceptable reasons for failure to secure presence of witnesses to inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** The justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact. The court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Without the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the DOJ and any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the drugs, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the subject sachet that was evidence of the corpus delicti, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Immediately after seizure and confiscation":**  The interpretation of this phrase in Section 21 is crucial. The SC emphasizes that ideally, inventory and photographing should occur at the place of apprehension.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide any justifiable grounds for not complying with the requirements of Section 21. This failure is fatal to their case.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Nila Malana due to reasonable doubt, citing the prosecution's failure to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 and the resulting compromise of the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.
