    *   **Damages:** PHP 30,000 civil indemnity, PHP 30,000 moral damages.
    *   **Ruling on Date:**  Precise date of the offense not a crucial element, the act is what matters. (Citing *People v. Gonzales*, G.R. No. 141599, June 29, 2004, 433 SCRA 102, 115).
*   **Criminal Case No. 10079 (Rape):** Accused had sexual intercourse with the 12-year-old victim, using a knife for intimidation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:** Guilty of rape and rape through sexual assault.
*   **Civil:** Liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** While the courts found the victim's testimony credible, scrutiny of testimony remains relevant in similar cases, particularly regarding the element of force or intimidation. The defense argued consent, which was dismissed.
*   **Impact of Victim's Age:** Victim was 12; statutory rape implications are present.
*   **Lack of Explicit Statutory Reference for Civil Indemnity and Moral Damages:** While the SC cited cases for the award of damages, there is no explicit statutory provision in the Revised Penal Code regarding these amounts. The current jurisprudence is important.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   Art. 266-A(1): Rape
    *   Art. 266-A(2): Rape through sexual assault
    *   Art. 266-B: Defines aggravating circumstances and penalties.
