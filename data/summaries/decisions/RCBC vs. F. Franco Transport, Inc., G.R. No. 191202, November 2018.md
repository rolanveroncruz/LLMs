## Legal Document Summary: Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. F. Franco Transport, Inc. (G.R. No. 191202)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's order directing the RTC to give due course to Respondent's Notice of Appeal.

**Key Provisions & Holding:**

*   **Appealability of Orders:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, SET ASIDE the CA's decision, and AFFIRMED the RTC's dismissal of the appeal. The Court ruled that the RTC has the power to dismiss appeals based only on two grounds: (1) untimeliness or (2) non-payment of docket fees (Rule 41, Section 13, Rules of Court). The RTC cannot base its decision on Rule 50, which gives the CA grounds for dismissal.
*   **Interlocutory vs. Final Orders:** The RTC's order denying the motion to recall the alias writ of possession and to hold its implementation in abeyance was considered an interlocutory order, which is not appealable (Rule 41, Section 1, Rules of Court).
*   **Writ of Possession:**  A Writ of Possession is a writ of execution that enforces a judgement to give the land's possession to the entitled person. The SC affirmed that a question raised against the mortgage's validity or foreclosure is not a ground to refuse the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   **Prior Resolutions:** The Court emphasized the previous ruling in G.R. No. 160925 affirming the RTC's directive for the implementation of the writ of possession, citing the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment.
*   **Compromise Agreements:** The Court stated that the possibility of a compromise agreement between the parties does not prevent the implementation of the alias writ. Parties cannot be compelled to enter into compromises, and the petitioner's reluctance was noted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **F. Franco Transport, Inc.:** Obligated to relinquish possession of the property and liable for costs of suit. Their attempts to delay the writ through motions and appeals were deemed insufficient.
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation:** Entitled to immediate implementation of the alias writ of possession.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further Litigation:** While the SC has ordered the implementation of the Writ, F. Franco Transport, Inc. could potentially pursue further actions (e.g., challenging the implementation itself) based on other grounds, although success is unlikely given the SC's strong stance.
*   **Resistance to Implementation:** The Respondent might resist physical eviction, potentially requiring further legal action for enforcement.
