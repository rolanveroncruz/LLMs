## Legal Document Summary: *Mayor Shirley M. Pangilinan v. Judge Inocencio M. Jaurigue and Atty. Cirilo Q. Tejoso, Jr.*

**Case:** A.M. No. RTJ-08-2100, January 31, 2008 (formerly A.M. OCA IPI No. 03-1689-RTJ)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a Regional Trial Court Judge and Branch Clerk of Court for gross ignorance of the law, abuse of authority, and disobedience to a superior order.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant:** Mayor Shirley M. Pangilinan alleged that the respondents (Judge Jaurigue and Clerk of Court Tejoso) improperly resumed the revision of ballots in Election Case No. 19 (EC No. 19), in contravention of a *status quo* order issued by the COMELEC in SPR No. 32-2001.
*   **COMELEC Orders:** The crux of the case hinges on conflicting COMELEC orders:
    *   SPR No. 32-2001: *Status quo* order suspending ballot revision in EC No. 19.
    *   EPC No. 2001-34: Orders directing the revision and appreciation of ballots, but allegedly limited to specific precincts.
*   **Judge's Order (June 5, 2002):** Judge Jaurigue issued an order directing resumption of ballot revision in EC No. 19, relying on the COMELEC's EPC No. 2001-34 orders.  Complainant argues that this violated the *status quo* order and expanded the scope of revision beyond the precincts specified in EPC No. 2001-34.
*   **Clerk of Court's Actions:**  Clerk Tejoso proceeded with the revision based on the Judge's order, even in the absence of the Judge, stamping the order "Original Signed" at the Judge's direction.
*   **Absences:**  The Judge was absent from his station on multiple days surrounding the issuance and implementation of the order, purportedly for "official business" (a dialogue with the IBP-Occidental Mindoro Chapter).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Jaurigue:**  Obligated to adhere to COMELEC orders and to diligently supervise court proceedings. Found liable for gross inefficiency, serious misconduct, and gross neglect of duty. He misinterpreted COMELEC orders or failed to properly qualify his orders. His absences without proper leave and delegation of signing authority were considered serious breaches.
*   **Atty. Tejoso:**  Obligated to exercise reasonable diligence and follow instructions of the presiding judge. Found liable for failure to exercise reasonable diligence in the issuance of the Order dated June 5, 2002 and in the revision of ballots.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of COMELEC Orders:** Respondent Judge claimed inconsistent COMELEC orders created ambiguity, justifying his interpretation. The Court found this argument unpersuasive.
*   **Delegation of Authority:** Judge's delegation of signing authority to the Clerk of Court is problematic, particularly in the context of a potentially contentious election case. This can be viewed as an abdication of judicial responsibility.
*   **Discretion in Interpretation:** While judges have discretion in interpreting orders, the Court found the Judge's interpretation to be erroneous and unreasonable, particularly given the existing *status quo* order.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Implied reference to relevant provisions of the Rules of Court and possibly the Omnibus Election Code regarding election protests, COMELEC jurisdiction, and judicial conduct.
*   The decision implicitly relies on established principles of administrative law regarding the duties and responsibilities of judges and court personnel.

**Outcome:**

*   Judge Jaurigue was suspended from office without pay for six months.
*   Atty. Tejoso was reprimanded with a warning.
