## Legal Document Summary: *Etino v. People*, G.R. No. 206632

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming with modification the RTC conviction of Petitioner for Frustrated Homicide.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *partially* grants the petition, modifying the conviction to Serious Physical Injuries under Article 263, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Frustrated Homicide (Information dated June 19, 2003). Elements are not in dispute; rather, whether actions can be inferred to be attempted, or frustrated homicide vs. serious physical injuries is being reviewed.
*   **Facts:** Petitioner shot the victim with a 12-gauge shotgun. The CA affirmed the RTC's finding of guilt, awarding moral and temperate damages to the victim.
*   **Supreme Court's Reasoning:** The Court found that neither the *extent* of the injury (whether the wound was fatal if untreated) nor the *intent to kill* was sufficiently established for a conviction of Frustrated Homicide. There was no expert testimony regarding the Medical Certificate presented by the prosecution, as required by People v. Bernaldez, 355 Phil. 740, 757 (1998) to the extent that the document involves medical opinion by a physician not presented in court. Though the shotgun use was established, "intent to kill cannot be automatically drawn from the mere fact that the use of firearms is dangerous to life" per *Dado v. People*, 440 Phil. 521, 538 (2002). The court reasoned that discharging a single shot which did not hit a vital organ, coupled with immediate flight, suggested lack of *animus interficendi*. However, the victim's medical records show the incident caused the victim to be hospitalized for twenty days (Nov. 5, 2001- Nov. 25, 2001) and his period of healing to take between 2 to 4 weeks, therefore the elements for serious physical injuries had been met.
*   **Modified Conviction:** Serious Physical Injuries under Article 263, paragraph 4 of the RPC. Per the Court, "Any person who shall wound, beat, or assault another, shall be guilty of the crime of serious physical injuries and shall suffer" "[t]he penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period [which ranges from four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months], if the physical injuries inflicted shall have caused the illness or incapacity for labor of the injured person for more than thirty days."
*   **Penalty:** Indeterminate sentence of four (4) months of *arresto mayor* (minimum) to one (1) year and eight (8) months of *prision correccional* (maximum).
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Affirmed moral damages of P25,000.00 (pursuant to Article 2219 of the Civil Code) and temperate damages of P10,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The primary risk was the prosecution's failure to present expert medical testimony regarding the severity of the victim's injuries to establish a crucial element for frustrated homicide (i.e., that the injury was fatal if untreated). The court notes that doubt must be resolved in favor of petitioner ( *Epifanio v. People*, 552 Phil. 620, 631 (2007)) .
*   **Intent to Kill:** The lack of direct evidence and contradictory inferences regarding the Petitioner's intent to kill proved a key weakness in the prosecution's case. (*Rivera v. People*, 515 Phil. 824 (2006)).
*   **Civil aspect of the case:** Court reaffirmed award of moral damages and temperate damages despite no medical testimony and no documentary evidence proving the costs were presented.
*   **Alibi vs. Positive Identification:** The court found, and therefore ruled on a question of fact that the testimonies and alibi of the defense was not supported by any new evidence presented by the defense, and reiterated that positive identification of the defendant by the victim constitutes the highest credibility afforded by the court.
