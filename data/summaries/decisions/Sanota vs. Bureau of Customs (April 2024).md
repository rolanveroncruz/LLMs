## Legal Document Summary: *Sanota et al. v. Bureau of Customs* (G.R. No. 199479)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Prohibition.

**Issue:** Whether Customs Memorandum Order No. 37-2011 (CMO 37-2011), providing guidelines on media accreditation at the Bureau of Customs (BOC), violates freedom of speech, expression, and the press.

**Ruling:** Petition dismissed as moot and academic because CMO 37-2011 was expressly repealed by CMO 01-2014, which was in turn repealed by CMO 22-2015.

**Key Provisions of CMO 37-2011 (now repealed):**

*   **Accreditation Requirements:** Detailed requirements for publications, reporters, writers, and photographers seeking access to the BOC. These included SEC/DTI registration, Mayor's Permit, BIR Certificate, proof of circulation, and letters of assignment.
*   **Terms and Conditions:** Compliance with the Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics, mandatory ID wearing, prearranged interviews via PIAD, and restriction on the use of information to bona fide news reporting.
*   **Revocation/Cancellation:** Accreditation could be revoked after due notice and hearing by a Grievance Committee.

**Petitioners' Arguments:**

*   CMO 37-2011 constitutes censorship or prior restraint by limiting access to information of public interest.
*   Accreditation requirements are akin to business permits and are inappropriate for journalistic activities.
*   Enforcement of the Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics by the BOC is an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority and makes the BOC a censor.

**Respondent's (BOC) Arguments:**

*   CMO 37-2011 was an internal policy for orderly news gathering.
*   It was a content-neutral regulation of the manner of conducting interviews, not restricting the substance.
*   Compliance with the Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics is already expected of media practitioners.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution:**  Defines judicial power, including the requirement of an actual case or controversy for judicial review.
*   **Article III, Section 4 of the Constitution:** Guarantees freedom of speech, expression, and the press.
*   **Black's Law Dictionary:** Used to define "revocation," "repeal," "supersede," and "modification."
*   **Express Repeal:** CMO 01-2014 and CMO 22-2015 explicitly "revoked" and "repealed" the preceding memorandum orders. *Javier v. COMELEC* defines express repeal and its legal consequences.
*   **Angara v. Electoral Commission:**  Discusses the presumption of constitutionality of legislative enactments and the limited scope of judicial review.
*   **Mootness Doctrine:**  The case became moot because CMO 37-2011 was repealed, rendering a ruling on its constitutionality unnecessary (*Association of Medical Clinics for Overseas Workers, Inc. v. GCC Approved Medical Centers Association, Inc.*).
*   **Falcis v. Civil Registrar General:** Doctrine that advisory opinions won't be rendered in absence of actual case.
*   **Atty. Lozano v. Speaker Nograles:** Judiciary's power is limited to actual cases.
*   **Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council:** Requirement for actual abuse of questioned enactment, not mere possibility.
*   **Republic v. Roque:** No imminent threat to those challenging the statute.

**Concurring Opinion (Gesmundo, C.J.):**

* Agrees with the Ponencia.
* Emphasizes that it is improper for the Court to declare a repealed issuance as unconstitutional due to lack of an actual case or controversy.
* Cites the similar effects of express repeal and a declaration of unconstitutionality.

**Dissenting Opinion (Leonen, SAJ):**

*   Acknowledges mootness but argues for adjudication to guide future cases and safeguard constitutional freedoms.
*   Contends that CMO 37-2011, and even CMO 22-2015, is a content-based regulation constituting prior restraint, infringing free speech and press.
*   Argues the BOC's enforcement of the Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics is an overreach.
*    Calls for a need to safeguard the freedom of the press, and not to burden the gathering and reporting of journalistic work.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses (in the repealed CMO 37-2011):**

*   **Overly Broad Discretion:**  The Grievance Committee's power to revoke accreditation based on "valid complaints" and compliance with the Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics lacked clear standards, potentially leading to arbitrary application.
*   **Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics Enforcement:** The attempt by the BOC to enforce the Journalist's Code of Ethics, a non-legal, self-regulatory code, was legally dubious and threatened content-based censorship.
*   **Restrictions on Information Use:** The clause limiting information use to "bona fide news reporting" was vague and could be interpreted to stifle critical reporting.

**Legal Analysis:**

The court correctly dismissed the petition based on the mootness doctrine. The express repeal of CMO 37-2011 removed the immediate legal controversy. However, the dissenting opinion raises valid concerns about the potential for government regulation of the press and the chilling effect of overly broad accreditation requirements.

**Advice:**

*   While this case is resolved, it's crucial to monitor the implementation of CMO 22-2015 (or any subsequent regulations) to ensure they do not infringe on press freedom.
*   Assess CMO 22-2015 based on whether it functions to filter news rather than promote transparency.
*   Future challenges should focus on the specific provisions of the current regulations, arguing they constitute content-based restrictions or overly broad limitations on press access.
*  Emphasize the necessity for narrowly tailored regulation for the free flow of information.
