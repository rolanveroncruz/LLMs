## Legal Document Summary: *Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company v. Dumapis, et al.* (G.R. No. 163210)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) ruling that the dismissal of respondents (Dumapis, Tundagui, Liagao) by Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company (Lepanto) was illegal.

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of the respondents for alleged "highgrading" (theft of gold) was legal and supported by substantial evidence.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court denied Lepanto's petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Lepanto's Obligation:** To demonstrate just cause for dismissing employees. Art. 297 of the Labor Code outlines just causes.
*   **Employer's Right to Terminate:** Grounded on loss of trust and confidence, however, this must not be arbitrary.
*   **Labor Code Art. 221:** Allows the NLRC and Labor Arbiters (LA) to use reasonable means to ascertain facts without strict adherence to technical rules of evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lepanto's Liability:** Required to pay backwages (P480,182.63) and separation pay (P417,230.32) to Dumapis, Tundagui, and Liagao.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Admissibility vs. Probative Value of Evidence:** The core issue revolves around the *Joint Affidavit* of security investigators. While admissible under Labor Code Art. 221, the SC scrutinized its *probative value*.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The CA and NLRC initially deemed the affidavit inadmissible as hearsay (Rule 130, Sec. 36, Rules of Court). The SC clarified that in labor cases, this rule is relaxed, but substantial evidence is still required, citing *Skippers United Pacific, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 148893).
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The recantation by Madao, through an affidavit of desistance, regarding his initial implication of Liagao, undermined the probative value of his second statement and was given weight.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** While a valid ground for dismissal, the SC found that the employer failed to establish a basis for such loss of confidence.
*   **Finality of Judgment/Conclusiveness of Judgment:** The SC held that respondents were estopped from claiming right to reinstatement, citing the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, due to their previous failed appeal in CA-G.R. SP No. 75457 and G.R. No. 162554, concerning the same issue.
*   **Ambiguous Confessions:** Statements from the security guard and the shift boss, which either did not identify or contradicted the identity of the miners involved.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code Art. 221:** Relaxed rules of evidence in labor proceedings.
*   **Labor Code Art. 297:** Grounds for Termination
*   **Presidential Decree No. 581, Section 1:** Definition of High Grading.
*   **Rule 130, Sec. 36, Rules of Court:** Hearsay Rule
*   **Ang Tibay v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 69 Phil. 635 (1940):** Established the requirement of substantial evidence in administrative proceedings.
*   **Skippers United Pacific, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 148893:** Distinction between admissibility and probative value of evidence.
*   **Bantolino v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 153660:** relaxation of technical rules of evidence.
*   **Tan v. Court of Appeals, 415 Phil. 675 (2001):** Doctrine of Conclusiveness of Judgement

**Analysis:**

The Court prioritized the employees' rights, requiring substantial evidence to support the dismissal based on "highgrading." The inconsistent testimonies and the recantation by one of the accusing parties weighed heavily against Lepanto. This case highlights the balance between an employer's right to manage its workforce and the employee's right to security of tenure, especially in light of Art. 221 of the Labor Code.
