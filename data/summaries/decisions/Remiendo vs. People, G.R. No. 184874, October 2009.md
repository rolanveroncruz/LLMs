**Legal Document Summary: *Robert Remiendo y Siblawan v. People of the Philippines***

**Case:** G.R. No. 184874, October 9, 2009 (618 Phil. 273)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Robert Remiendo y Siblawan (Remiendo) for two counts of statutory rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 266-A (1)(d) of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines statutory rape as sexual intercourse with a girl below 12 years old.
*   **R.A. No. 9344 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006):** Deals with criminal liability for minors, specifically Section 6 regarding the minimum age of criminal responsibility.

**Facts:**

*   Remiendo was charged with two counts of statutory rape against AAA, alleging offenses in March and May 1997 when she was supposedly under 12 years old.
*   RTC found Remiendo guilty based on AAA's testimony and medical evidence.
*   CA affirmed the RTC's decision, modifying the civil liability amount.

**Issues/Contentions:**

1.  **Proof of Age:** Remiendo argues the prosecution failed to prove AAA's age at the time of the offense, claiming the Certificate of Live Birth was improperly admitted and questioning AAA's credibility.
2.  **Application of R.A. No. 9344:** Remiendo claims he should benefit from R.A. No. 9344, arguing the prosecution failed to prove he acted with discernment.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Proof of Age:**
    *   **Certificate of Live Birth:** The Court cited *People v. Pruna, 439 Phil. 440 (2002)*, outlining the hierarchy of evidence for proving a victim's age. While the Certificate of Live Birth wasn't formally admitted, the Court held the Certificate of Live Birth is a public document and prima facie evidence of the fact of birth, it can only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, which was not present. AAA and her mother's testimonies established her birth date, and the defense did not object during the trial.
2.  **Application of R.A. No. 9344:**
    *   The Court found Remiendo acted with discernment (understanding the difference between right and wrong) based on his actions during and after the commission of the crime (threats, concealment).  Citing *Llave v. People, G.R No. 166040, April 26, 2006*, the court held that the prosecution must prove that an accused acted with discernment and that in this case the prosecution had.
    *   Furthermore, Remiendo was over 21 years old when sentenced, making the provisions of R.A. No. 9344 (specifically, *Padua v. People, G.R. No. 168546, July 23, 2008)* moot and academic since the purpose of the law is for the children in conflict with the law.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Remiendo has an obligation to serve his sentence and pay civil liabilities.

**Liabilities:**

*   Remiendo is liable for two counts of statutory rape and is subject to penalties imposed by the RTC, as affirmed by the CA and the SC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   None identified, as the case is effectively closed with the Supreme Court's denial of the petition.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 266-A (1)(d)**
*   **R.A. No. 9344, Sec. 6 & Sec. 40**
*   **People v. Pruna, 439 Phil. 440 (2002)** - Establishes evidentiary standards for proving age.
*   **People v. Barcena, G.R. No. 168737, February 16, 2006** - References *People v. Pruna* on evidentiary standards.
*   **Llave v. People, G.R No. 166040, April 26, 2006** - Burden of proof for discernment.
*   **Padua v. People, G.R. No. 168546, July 23, 2008** - Addresses the application of R.A. 9344 if accused over age of majority.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The acceptance of AAA's Certificate of Live Birth as evidence, despite not being formally admitted by the RTC. The Court reasoned the document to be self-authenticating, thus mitigating a potential objection to its admissibility.
