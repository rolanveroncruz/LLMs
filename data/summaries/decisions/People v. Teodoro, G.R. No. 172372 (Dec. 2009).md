## Legal Document Summary: People v. Teodoro, G.R. No. 172372

**Case Overview:** This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Romar Teodoro for two counts of statutory rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended before R.A. 8353. Accused was acquitted in one count of statutory rape.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes rape, specifically paragraph 3 relating to carnal knowledge of a woman under 12 years of age. The RPC provisions applicable are those *before* the effectivity of Republic Act No. 8353.
*   **Statutory Rape:** No need to prove force, intimidation, or physical injury. The elements are: (1) carnal knowledge, and (2) the victim is under 12 years of age.
*   **Section 6, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Sufficiency of Information. Requires information to contain the approximate date of the commission of the offense, but not the exact date.
*   **Article 2229 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding exemplary damages to deter abuse of youth.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Convicted of two counts of statutory rape. Sentenced to reclusion perpetua for each count.
*   **Civil Liability:** Accused ordered to pay the victim:
    *   ₱50,000.00 civil indemnity per count (Total: ₱100,000.00)
    *   ₱50,000.00 moral damages per count (Total: ₱100,000.00)
    *   ₱30,000.00 exemplary damages per count (Total: ₱60,000.00)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Information (Crim. Case No. 8539):** The appellant challenged the Information for failing to specify the *exact* date of the commission of the crime, arguing that the phrase "sometime in the first week of July 1995" was insufficient. The Supreme Court, citing Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, found the information sufficient, as it contained the "approximate date." The court also noted that the appellant did not object to the form of the complaint or information at arraignment and is deemed to have waived such objection on appeal. This could be a ground for dissent if the appellant challenges the decision.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87 (2004):** Transferred case to the CA for appropriate action and disposition.
*   **People v. Pancho, 462 Phil. 193 (2003):**  Statutory rape definition regarding the irrelevance of force and the victim's age.
*   **People v. Natan, G.R. No. 181086 (2008):** Further clarification of the consent of the victim being immaterial when victim is under 12 years of age
*   **People v. Valenzuela, G.R. No. 182057 (2009):** Reiterates that the subject of inquiry of statutory rape is only age and whether carnal knowledge took place
*   **People v. Sia, G.R. No. 174059 (2009):** Proper indemnity of the victim of rape.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The prosecution successfully established the elements of statutory rape. The victim's testimony, corroborated by medical evidence, was found credible.
*   The appellant's defense of denial was deemed weak.
*   The absence of specific date in one Information was not fatal to the case.
*   The court awarded civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, as per established jurisprudence.
