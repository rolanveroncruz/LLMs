## Legal Document Summary: ABS-CBN vs. PMSI

**Case:** ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation vs. Philippine Multi-Media System, Inc. (G.R. Nos. 175769-70, January 19, 2009)

**Subject Matter:** Intellectual Property Rights (Broadcasting and Copyright), "Must-Carry" Rule, Constitutionality of NTC Memorandum Circular No. 04-08-88

**Key Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation
*   **Respondents:** Philippine Multi-Media System, Inc. (PMSI) and its Board of Directors

**Background:** ABS-CBN (broadcaster) sued PMSI (DTH satellite television provider) for unauthorized rebroadcasting of ABS-CBN's Channels 2 and 23, alleging infringement of broadcasting rights and copyright under the Intellectual Property Code (IP Code). PMSI claimed its actions were authorized by NTC Memorandum Circular No. 4-08-88 (the "Must-Carry" Rule), which requires cable TV operators to carry signals of authorized TV broadcast stations.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals and the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) Director-General, finding in favor of PMSI.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Broadcasting Rights & Copyright (IP Code Sections 211 & 177):** The Court ruled PMSI's actions did not constitute "rebroadcasting" as defined by the IP Code and the Rome Convention because PMSI merely carried ABS-CBN's signals, not creating its own broadcasts. PMSI did not have financial or editorial responsibilty of the content broadcasted in Channels 2 & 23.
*   **NTC Memorandum Circular No. 04-08-88 (Must-Carry Rule):** The Court agreed with the NTC's interpretation that the "Must-Carry" Rule applies to DTH services like PMSI, despite the circular primarily addressing cable TV operators. This interpretation, according to the Court, promotes wider dissemination of information and serves the public interest, in line with the Constitution.
*   **Cable Retransmission:** The Court likened PMSI's services to cable retransmission, which is not protected under the Rome Convention. This further weakens ABS-CBN's claim of copyright infringement.
*   **Limitations on Copyright (IP Code Section 184.1(h)):** The Court held that the 'Must-Carry Rule' falls under the limitation of Government using the work by or under the direction of the Government such as the NTC where the use is in public interest and fair use.

**Obligations:**

*   PMSI is obligated to comply with the "Must-Carry" Rule as interpreted by the NTC.
*   Both ABS-CBN and PMSI are obligated to provide public service time and balanced programming as per their legislative franchises (RA 7966 & RA 8630).

**Liabilities:**

*   The Court found PMSI **not liable** for copyright infringement or violation of broadcasting rights.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constitutionality of the "Must-Carry" Rule:** ABS-CBN's argument that the "Must-Carry" Rule constitutes a taking of property without just compensation (violating Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution) was not addressed directly by the court. The Court side-stepped the issue, stating that resolution was not necessary to decide the case. This leaves open the possibility of future challenges to the rule's constitutionality on similar grounds.
*   **"Commercial Purpose" Argument:** ABS-CBN argued PMSI's carriage of its signals was for commercial gain. The Court rejected this argument due to lack of substantial evidence. The burden of proof of substantial evidence lays on the complainant. However, future cases may require careful examination of the potential competitive advantages gained by DTH providers from carrying free-to-air channels.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **IP Code (RA 8293), Sections 177 & 211**
*   **Rome Convention**
*   **NTC Memorandum Circular No. 04-08-88**
*   **NTC Memorandum Circular No. 10-10-2003**
*   **Telecom. Broadcast Attys. of the Phils., Inc. v. COMELEC, 352 Phil. 153 (1998)**
*   **Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. v. International Communication Corporation, G.R. No. 135992, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 163.**

**Ambiguities:**

*   The breadth of the application of NTC Memorandum Circular No. 04-08-88 on providers beyond cable services and DTH such as streaming services could be an area of concern.

**Conclusion:** The Court's decision favors PMSI, emphasizing public interest concerns and the regulatory authority of the NTC. While the ruling provides clarity regarding the application of the "Must-Carry" Rule to DTH services, the unanswered constitutional question leaves room for potential future litigation. The lack of substantial evidence on commercial purpose also remains to be a contentious area, as the value of broadcast signals could grow with digital distribution.
