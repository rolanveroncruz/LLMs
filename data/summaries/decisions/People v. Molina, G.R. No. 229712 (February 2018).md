**Legal Document Summary: People v. Delia C. Molina, G.R. No. 229712**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming Court of Appeals' conviction of Delia C. Molina for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Sections 6 and 7 of Republic Act No. 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995), specifically Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale. This involves recruiting three or more persons without a valid license/authority or failing to deploy and reimburse expenses.
*   **Defendant:** Delia C. Molina, President of Southern Cotabato Landbase Management Corporation (a recruitment agency).
*   **Complainants:** Maria C. Luya, Gilbert B. Ubi√±a, Wilfredo I. Logo, Benjamin B. Delos Santos, and Maylen S. Bolda.
*   **Accusation:** Molina, acting through an associate (Juliet Pacon), recruited the complainants for overseas employment (South Korea) for a fee, failed to deploy them, and failed to reimburse their expenses.
*   **License Status:** While the agency initially had a provisional license, it was suspended and later expired. The Court found Molina liable even as a licensee due to the failure to reimburse.
*   **Liability for Juridical Persons:**  R.A. 8042 explicitly states that officers having control, management, or direction of the business are liable in cases of juridical persons.

**Obligations:**

*   Duty to possess a valid license or authority for recruitment. (Art. 13(f) of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended).
*   Duty to deploy workers as promised or reimburse expenses if deployment fails without the worker's fault (Section 6(m) of RA 8042).
*   As President of the recruitment agency, Molina had a duty to oversee its operations and ensure compliance with relevant laws.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Convicted of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, considered economic sabotage under RA 8042, leading to a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay actual damages to each complainant, plus legal interest.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Non-Participation:** Molina claimed she did not personally recruit the complainants or receive their payments. The Court rejected this argument because the recruitment occurred in the agency she headed, and witnesses testified to her presence and assurances.
*   **Issue of License Validity:** Initially, the defense hinged on the agency having a license during recruitment. The Court found that even if the license was valid, the failure to deploy and reimburse was sufficient for a conviction.
*   **Co-Accused at Large:** Juliet Pacon's absence raises issues of potential accomplice liability and the full picture of the conspiracy.
*   **Interest Computation:** The interest on the damages was modified by the Supreme Court to be computed from the *date of finality of the decision*, unlike the lower courts.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995), Sections 6 & 7:** Defines and penalizes illegal recruitment.
*   **PD 442 (Labor Code of the Philippines), Article 13(f):** Defines recruitment and placement.
*   **People v. Crispin Billaber y Matbanua:**  Cited by the lower courts, this case states that receipts are not required for a successful prosecution of an illegal recruitment case.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Cited in the court decision, which discusses guidelines for legal interest.
*   **People v. Reyes, 714 Phil. 300, 306-307 (2013)** Cited in People v. Owen Marcelo Cagalingan, G.R. No. 198664, November 23, 2016, regarding overturning rulings based on error or bias, etc.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the stringent penalties for illegal recruitment, particularly when committed in large scale.  Molina's conviction underscores the responsibility of corporate officers in ensuring compliance with recruitment laws.  The ruling also clarifies that failure to deploy and reimburse expenses is sufficient for conviction, even if a recruitment agency possesses a valid license. A significant area of analysis would be assessing other cases related to Ms. Molina, given her admission of prior convictions, and assessing her avenues for appeal.
