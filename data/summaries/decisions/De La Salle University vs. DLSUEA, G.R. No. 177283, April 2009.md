**Case Summary: De La Salle University vs. De La Salle University Employees Association (DLSUEA-NAFTEU)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether De La Salle University (DLSU) committed Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) by interfering with the internal affairs of the De La Salle University Employees Association (DLSUEA-NAFTEU) during an intra-union dispute.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Intra-Union Dispute:** A splinter group (Aliazas group) challenged the incumbent union officers, alleging failure to call for elections. DOLE ordered an election, but the incumbent officers disregarded it.
*   **Escrow Account:** The Aliazas group requested DLSU to place collected union dues in escrow until a new election. DLSU complied, citing DOLE and BLR orders, and suspended normal relations with the incumbent officers, establishing a savings account for the Union.
*   **ULP Complaint:** DLSUEA-NAFTEU filed a ULP complaint, alleging undue interference and discrimination.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   Labor Arbiter dismissed the ULP complaint.
    *   NLRC 2nd Division affirmed the dismissal.
    *   NLRC 3rd Division (in a separate certified case) initially ordered consolidation of the ULP complaint, but this was later reversed by the Court of Appeals (CA) 10th Division.
    *   CA 1st Division, unaware of the CA 10th Division decision, reversed the NLRC 2nd Division decision and ordered transmittal of the ULP complaint records to the NLRC 3rd Division.
*   **BLR Clarification:** BLR Director issued a letter stating there was no void in union leadership and incumbent officers retained authority until successors were elected.

**Holdings:**

*   **Procedural Issue:** The Supreme Court (SC) held the CA 1st Division's order to transmit the records to the NLRC 3rd Division was moot, as the CA 10th Division had already ruled against consolidation, and that ruling was final.
*   **ULP Finding:** The SC found DLSU liable for ULP. DLSU's actions of withholding union dues and suspending relations with incumbent officers constituted interference, violating the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
*   **Damages:** The SC awarded DLSUEA-NAFTEU nominal damages (P250,000) and attorney's fees (P50,000).

**Reasoning:**

*   **CBA Obligation:** DLSU had a CBA obligation to observe its terms regarding union dues and representation. DLSU acted unilaterally without notification to DOLE.
*   **No Void in Leadership:** The BLR clarification confirmed the incumbent officers' continued authority, meaning DLSU interfered in an ongoing leadership.
*   **Good Faith Inapplicable:** the court found that the school action did not ensure a "trouble-free election process"

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Balancing Management Rights and Union Autonomy:** The case highlights the difficult balance between an employer's legitimate interest in maintaining neutrality and the legal requirement to avoid interfering in union affairs.
*   **Impact of Intra-Union Disputes:** The case illustrates how intra-union conflicts can expose employers to ULP charges if their actions are deemed to favor one faction over another.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** The case serves as a reminder of the limits of the "good faith" defense.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act 6715 (Amendments to the Labor Code):** Mentioned regarding the extension of union officers' terms.
*   **Article 2221 (Nominal Damages) and Article 2208 (8) (Attorney's Fees) of the Civil Code:** Basis for the damage awards.
*   **Labor Code Provisions on Unfair Labor Practices (Art. 248(a)):** Cited in the Dissent
*   **Article 263 (g) of the Labor Code: Mentioned in the Concurring Opinion

**Ambiguous and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "interference" in the context of an intra-union dispute and the extent to which an employer can take action to maintain neutrality.
*   Extent of good faith defense.

**Dissent:**

*   Jurisdictional Challenge: Argued the SC lacked jurisdiction to rule on the ULP merits, as only the CA 1st Division's procedural order was under review, and the NLRC 2nd Division decision affirming the dismissal had already become final.
*   Merits of ULP Charge: Argued DLSU acted in good faith to maintain neutrality and ensure continued school operations, with no anti-union animus. Considered actions as protecting employees in general.
*  Criticized that the BLR letter cannot overrule DOLE orders.
