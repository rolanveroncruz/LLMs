## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Mendoza* (G.R. No. 123186, July 9, 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape under Article 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 294(2) RPC:** Defines Robbery with Rape and prescribes the penalty of *reclusion temporal* in its medium period to *reclusion perpetua*, and *reclusion perpetua* to death when committed with a deadly weapon or by two or more persons.
*   **Conspiracy:** Establishes that a conspiracy to rob is sufficient to hold all conspirators liable as principals for Robbery with Rape, even if only one committed the rape, citing *People v. Lascuna*.  The law does not require rape to be committed before, during or after the robbery, *People v. Caisip*.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Places the burden on the accused, Mendoza, to prove his minority at the time of the commission of the offense, referencing *People v. Lugto*.

**Liabilities and Penalties:**

*   The Regional Trial Court (RTC) found Mendoza guilty and sentenced him to *Reclusion Perpetua*, and ordered him to indemnify the victim P12,000.00 as actual damages and P100,000.00 as moral damages, plus costs.
*   The Supreme Court (SC) affirms the conviction but modifies the penalty due to Mendoza's minority at the time of the crime (17 years old, 1 month, and 23 days).
*   The SC applied Article 68 of the RPC (privileged mitigating circumstance of minority). The SC imposes an indeterminate sentence of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* in its maximum period to 18 years, 2 months and 21 days of *reclusion temporal* in its maximum period.
*   Mendoza is jointly and severally liable for actual and moral damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy Doctrine:** High risk that Mendoza can be convicted of a more serious crime than he actually did.  The SC's reliance on the conspiracy doctrine to impute the act of rape to Mendoza is potentially problematic if his intent was solely limited to robbery, similar to what was decided in People vs. Canturia where there was lack of evidence that the accused knew of the lustful intent of his co-accused.
*   **Conflicting Evidence of Age:** The conflicting birthdate evidence presented by Mendoza created uncertainty.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** Absence of the stolen items recovered from Mendoza is not exculpatory but could be exploited on appeal (although the SC explicitly rejects this argument based on precedent).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Ching* and *People v. Ulili:* Testimony of the victim can be enough to issue a conviction.
*   *People v. Lascuna, People v. Caisip:* Conspiracy to rob is sufficient to make the conspirators accountable for the rape.
*   *People v. Lugto:* Burden of proof for showing that the accused was a minor.
*   *People v. Tiongco:* The co-conspirators cannot be excluded from the penalty if the rape was committed during the robbery.
*   *People v. Baello, People v. Salvatierra, People v. Macam:* Once a conspiracy has been proven, both actors are equally culpable for the rape,
*   *People v. Canturia:* There must be evidence that the actor was aware of the co-accused's intent to commit the crime.

**Ambiguous Areas:**

*   The extent of Mendoza's knowledge and participation in the rape beyond merely pointing out the house. This issue becomes crucial in light of the conspiracy doctrine applied by the Court.

**Overall Assessment:**

Mendoza faces a strong conviction based on positive identification and the established conspiracy doctrine. However, the modification of the sentence due to minority provides a partial success. The application of conspiracy law requires the re-assessment of the extent of Mendoza's participation, and awareness of his co-conspirator's lustful intent, as held in People vs. Canturia.
