**Case Summary: *Julio Mercado v. Edmundo Mercado*, G.R. No. 178672 (2009)**

**Facts:**

*   Julio Mercado (Tenant/Petitioner) was issued a Certificate of Land Transfer (CLT) and an Emancipation Patent (EP) in 1976 and 1982 respectively, under PD 27, for agricultural land he tenanted under Edmundo Mercado's (Landowner/Respondent) grandfather.
*   Edmundo Mercado, relying on a Certificate of Retention (CR) issued based on his grandfather's *Huling Habilin*, filed a complaint with the Provincial Adjudication Board (PARAB) in 1994 for rescission of contract, cancellation of the CLT/EP, back rentals, and ejectment. He alleged irregular CLT/EP issuance and non-payment of rentals since 1979.
*   Petitioner contends his EP barred Respondent's claim, and that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations under Section 38 of RA 3844 (as amended by RA 6389).
*   PARAB dismissed the case, finding the EP valid. The DARAB reversed, finding deliberate non-compliance with PD 816 (failure to pay rentals/amortizations).
*   The DARAB ordered rescission of the leasehold, ejectment of the Petitioner, and cancellation of the CLTs.
*   Petitioner's subsequent attempts to challenge the DARAB decision through certiorari, petition for review, and petition for relief from judgment were unsuccessful.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 27 (Tenant Emancipation Decree):** Basis for CLT and EP issuance.
*   **PD 816:** Mandates timely payment of lease rentals or amortizations by farmer-beneficiaries. Non-compliance can lead to forfeiture of rights.
*   **RA 3844, Section 38 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Statute of limitations argument raised by Petitioner.
*   **Obligation to pay lease rentals:** Tenant's obligation until land valuation is established and amortization payments commence.
*   **Certificate of Retention (CR):** Landowner's right to retain a portion of land under agrarian reform laws.
*   **Emancipation Patent (EP):** Granting ownership to the tenant-farmer after fulfilling requirements.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Found liable for deliberate non-payment of lease rentals and/or amortizations under PD 816, leading to rescission and ejectment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of DARAB Decision:** The decision has become final and executory, making it very difficult to challenge or overturn, as recognized by the court.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction Argument Weakened by Active Participation:**  Petitioner's argument that the DARAB lacked jurisdiction is weakened because he actively participated in the proceedings.
*   **Statute of Limitations Argument Weak:** Respondent filed the case in 1994. Non-payment of rentals since 1979 could fall within the prescriptive period for certain actions.
*   **Reliance on Huling Habilin:** Validity of the Certificate of Retention may be questionable due to reliance on the Huling Habilin.
*   **Risk of Double Costs:**  Petitioner faces double costs due to the multiple unsuccessful appeals.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 27**
*   **PD 816**
*   **RA 3844, Section 38 (as amended by RA 6389)**
*   ***Ayo-Alburo v. Matobato*, G.R. No. 155181 (2005):** Reaffirms that issuance of EP is not beyond attack and scrutiny; DARAB has jurisdiction over EP cancellation.
*   ***Biglang-awa v. Philippine Trust Company*, G.R. No. 158998 (2008):** Decision becomes immutable and unalterable once final and executory except in certain cases.
*   ***Villacastin v. Pelaez*, G.R. No. 170478 (2008):** Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint.
*   ***Morta, Sr. v. Occidental*, 367 Phil. 438 (1999):** Outlines the elements of tenancy relationship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Certificate of Retention (CR):** The CR's issuance based on the *Huling Habilin* could be a point of contention. The precise nature and legal effect of the *Huling Habilin* need to be examined.
*   **Lack of Due Process Claim:**  Petitioner argued a violation of due process due to the withdrawal of his counsel and a "short" period to find new counsel.

**Analysis:**

The Court clearly favors upholding the finality of the DARAB decision. Petitioner's procedural missteps and continued attempts to re-litigate the already decided issues have prejudiced his position. Success on appeal is highly unlikely given the Court's emphasis on the finality of the DARAB decision and the lack of jurisdictional defects. The argument regarding the validity of the Certificate of Retention (CR) would have been a better avenue of attack, but likely this argument has also been waived due to lack of diligence.
