## Legal Document Summary: Philippine Health Insurance Corporation vs. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 222838)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 64 assailing COA Decision No. 2015-093 and Resolution dated December 15, 2015, which affirmed the disallowance of Institutional Meeting Expenses (IME) for 2010 paid to PhilHealth's Board of Directors (BOD).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed P2,965,428.59 in IME paid to PhilHealth BOD members in 2010.
*   **PhilHealth's Argument:** PhilHealth argued that the IME was a legitimate reimbursement of expenses incurred in the discharge of official functions. They also argued that the COA erred in its computation for filing the appeal on time. They also pointed out that there was no legal prohibition for the benefits, and that they acted in good faith.
*   **COA's Argument:**
    *   Appeal was filed out of time.
    *   Section 18(d) of RA 7875 only provides for *per diems* as compensation for BOD members. BOD exceeded its authority by granting IME.
    *   IME constituted irregular expense as it was charged to other accounts in order to circumvent the GAA and COA circular restrictions on Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses (EME).
    *   Good faith is not applicable because the AOM notified the BOD members of the legal deficiencies of the IME.
*   **Distinction Between Board Members:** Appointive and ex officio members. Ex officio members are not entitled to additional compensation as their services are already covered by their principal office.
*   **Fiscal Autonomy Argument Rejected:** PhilHealth cannot use its fiscal autonomy under Section 16(n) of RA 7875 to circumvent limitations in Section 26(b). Power to fix compensation is limited to PhilHealth personnel, not BOD members.
*   **GAA Limits EME Appropriation:** The Court acknowledged that the GAA provides for EME limits, but the PhilHealth's irregular charging of other accounts made it non-compliant with the provisions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7875 (National Health Insurance Act):** Section 18(d) limits BOD compensation to per diems. Sections 16(n) and 26(b) regarding fiscal autonomy.
*   **RA 9241 (Amendment to RA 7875):** Discusses the composition of the Board of Directors.
*   **RA 9970 (2010 GAA):** Section 28 sets ceilings for EME appropriations.
*   **COA Circular No. 2006-001:** Guidelines on the Disbursement of Extraordinary and Miscellaneous Expenses in GOCCs/GFIs.
*   **DBM-National Budget Circular No. 2007-510:** Ex-officio members may receive reimbursement for transportation and miscellaneous expenses, but only as appropriated in the GAA of their respective departments.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Primetown Property Group, Inc.:** Distinguishes how time is construed. This does not apply in the case at hand, as there is no distinction on how to account for the period of the "month" according to the Civil Code and the Administrative Code.
*   **Bases Conversion and Development Authority v. COA:** Specification of compensation limits implies exclusion of other benefits. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Also discussed the need to limit compensation in BOD.
*   **PhilHealth v. COA:** PhilHealth does not have unbridled discretion to issue any and all kinds of allowances, limited only by the provisions of its charter.
*   **Social Security System v. COA:** Fiduciary duty requires restraint in allocating funds.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Section 18(d) of RA 7875 regarding "allowances and per diems" and whether it excludes other forms of compensation.
*   The application of DBM-National Budget Circular No. 2007-510 regarding ex officio members receiving transportation and miscellaneous expenses, and whether this extends beyond what's appropriated in their respective department's GAA.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   Liability for refund of disallowed IME by BOD members. The Court denied the plea of good faith due to the issuance of AOM putting the BOD on notice and a lack of the highest degree of responsibility.
*   Potential for similar disallowances in future audits if the BOD continues to grant benefits beyond what is expressly authorized by law and the GAA.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the COA's disallowance, emphasizing that the IME lacks legal basis and that PhilHealth cannot circumvent GAA and COA circulars. The BOD should be mindful of the explicit limits on its compensation and the fiduciary responsibility it owes to the public.
