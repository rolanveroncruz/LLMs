## Legal Document Summary: MERALCO v. Vda. De Santiago (G.R. No. 170482)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari where MERALCO appealed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which reversed the RTC's ruling dismissing Aguida Vda. de Santiago's (Aguida) complaint for damages due to illegal disconnection of electricity. The CA found that MERALCO disconnected Aguida's electricity without due process and awarded moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees to Aguida, while dismissing MERALCO's claim for differential billing. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **MERALCO's Obligation:** Provide electric service and adhere to due process before disconnection.
*   **Republic Act No. 7832 (Anti-Electricity Pilferage Act):** MERALCO invoked this act to justify immediate disconnection due to alleged meter tampering. Section 4 defines *prima facie* evidence of illegal electricity use.
*   **Contract of Service:** MERALCO also relied on this. While the details of the contract of service were not detailed, they were used to justify the disconnection.
*   **Prima Facie Evidence (Section 4, RA 7832):** This section outlines circumstances that constitute *prima facie* evidence of illegal electricity use. The discovery of tampering must be witnessed and attested to by an officer of the law or an ERB representative.

**Liabilities:**

*   **MERALCO's Liability:** Found liable for damages (moral, exemplary, and attorney's fees) due to illegal disconnection, as MERALCO was unable to present sufficient evidence of meter tampering and failed to follow due process.
*   **Aguida Vda. de Santiago's Liability:** Originally ordered by the RTC to pay MERALCO a differential billing. Overturned by the CA, affirmed by the SC.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The core issue is whether MERALCO presented sufficient and credible evidence of meter tampering to justify disconnection under RA 7832. The SC agreed with CA that it was lacking.
*   **Due Process:** MERALCO's disconnection was deemed unlawful because the alleged evidence of tampering was not properly witnessed/attested to, and questions were raised on the legitimacy of the witness (PO2 Chavez), specifically his jurisdiction.
*   **Differential Billing Calculation:** MERALCO initially sought a higher differential billing amount which was also contested by Aguida and rejected by the CA.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7832 (Anti-Electricity Pilferage Act):** Central statute at issue, particularly Section 4 regarding *prima facie* evidence of illegal use of electricity.
*   **Quisumbing v. Meralco, G.R. No. 142943, April 3, 2002:** Cited in the decision stating that the prima facie presumption authorizing immediate disconnection arises only upon satisfaction of certain requisites, one of which is the personal witnessing and attestation by an officer of the law or by an authorized ERB representative when the discovery was made.
*   **General Rules on Appellate Review:** The SC reiterated the general rule of respecting factual findings of the Court of Appeals, but recognized that these are not applicable when, inter alia, the findings are contrary to those of the trial court.
*   **Ontimare, Jr. v. Elep, G.R. No. 159224, January 20, 2006:** Provides the list of recognized exceptions to that rule.
*   **Vibram Manufacturing Corporation v. Manila Electric Company, G.R. No. 149052, August 9, 2005:** Reiterates the doctrine that in a civil case, the factual findings of the trial court are final and conclusive, but only if supported by clear and convincing evidence on record.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Routine Inspection":** The legitimacy of the inspection was questioned because it was conducted by police officers outside of their jurisdiction.
*   **Witness Testimony and Attestation:** Validity challenged by the lack of coordination from the witness's local police station.
