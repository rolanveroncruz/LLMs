## Legal Document Summary: LBP vs. Planters Development Bank, G.R. No. 160395

**Case Overview:** This case involves a dispute over just compensation for land compulsorily acquired by the DAR under RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law) from Planters Development Bank (PDB). The LBP's valuation of the land was significantly lower than PDB's desired valuation, leading to a judicial determination of just compensation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** This is the core legal basis for the land acquisition, outlining the rules for compulsory land acquisition and just compensation.
*   **Valuation of Land:** The central issue revolves around the proper valuation of the land expropriated. The LBP's initial valuation was rejected by PDB. The trial court set aside the LBP/DARAB valuation and fixed it at P2.50/sqm based on neighboring property sales and the assessor's schedule of values.
*   **Judicial Determination of Just Compensation:** PDB filed an action in the RTC (Spl. Agrarian Case No. RTC-49-I) for judicial determination of just compensation.
*   **Default Declaration:** DARAB, DAR Provincial Adjudicator, and LBP were declared in default for failure to file pre-trial briefs.

**Obligations:**

*   **LBP:** Obligated to provide just compensation for the acquired land, as mandated by RA 6657. LBP also had the obligation to file its appellant's brief.
*   **DAR:** Obligated to properly implement RA 6657 and determine just compensation fairly.

**Liabilities:**

*   LBP is potentially liable to pay the higher valuation determined by the RTC, subject to appellate review.
*   The case highlights the tension between the LBP's statutory mandate to manage funds efficiently and the constitutional right of landowners to just compensation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Methodology under RA 6657:** The ambiguous application of valuation factors under RA 6657 creates a risk of inconsistent or unfair compensation. The case hinges on whether the trial court correctly applied these factors when setting the valuation at P2.50/sqm. The DARAB and LBP were in default, hindering a thorough defense of their valuation method.
*   **Procedural Technicality:** The Court of Appeals initially dismissed the appeal due to the LBP's failure to file its brief on time. This raises the risk of a decision based on procedure rather than the merits of the just compensation issue. This was set aside by the Supreme Court.
*   **Impact of Default:** The declaration of default against the DARAB and LBP in the trial court significantly hampered their ability to present evidence and argue their valuation. This is a major weakness in their position.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The Resolution cites _Great Southern Maritime Services Corporation v. Acu√±a_ and _Barnes v. Padilla_, emphasizing the courts' prerogative to relax procedural rules in the interest of justice.
*   Jurisprudence regarding the determination of just compensation under RA 6657 will be crucial.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** The primary statute governing the case.
*   **Rules of Court:** Relevant to the procedural aspects of the appeal.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The trial court's complete reliance on the respondent's evidence due to the default of the other parties is contentious and requires careful scrutiny on appeal. The justification for setting aside the DARAB valuation needs to be thoroughly examined.

**Conclusion:**

This case presents a significant challenge for LBP due to its default at the trial court level and initial dismissal by the CA based on procedure. The success of LBP's appeal now remanded depends on demonstrating that the trial court's valuation was erroneous, despite their default, and that the delay in filing the appellant's brief was excusable.
