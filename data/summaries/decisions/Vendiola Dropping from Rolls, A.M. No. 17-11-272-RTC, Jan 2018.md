**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 17-11-272-RTC**

**Nature:** Administrative Matter regarding the dropping from the rolls of Lemuel H. Vendiola, Sheriff IV, RTC Bi√±an City, Laguna.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** Vendiola is dropped from the rolls effective May 2, 2012, due to absence without official leave (AWOL) since April 2012. Position declared vacant.
*   **Legal Basis:** Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, as amended by Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2007, allows separation from service/dropping from the rolls for continuous AWOL of at least 30 working days.
*   **Benefits and Reemployment:** Vendiola is still qualified for benefits under existing laws and may be reemployed in government.
*   **Audit and Liability:** Dropping from the rolls is *without prejudice* to any liability arising from the completion of the audit.

**Obligations:**

*   Vendiola had an obligation to submit DTRs and leave applications, which he failed to do since May 2012.
*   Implied obligation to adhere to standards of public service, efficiency, responsibility, integrity, and loyalty.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for Sheriff Trust Fund (STF) shortages pending audit (unclear exactly what STF stands for, leading to a need for further investigation).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **STF Liability:** The audit may reveal shortages in the Sheriff Trust Fund, resulting in financial liability and/or criminal prosecution.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** While the document states notification will be served at his address, the lack of Vendiola's participation raises potential procedural due process concerns if he can demonstrate he was unaware of the proceedings, although the continued absence without notice may have forfeited his due process rights.

*   Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave (as amended by MC No. 13, s. 2007).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of STF and Audit:** The ambiguity surrounding the nature of the STF (Sheriff Trust Fund) and the scope of the audit is a concern.  Further investigation is needed to determine the potential financial exposure.
*   **Notice:**  The document states a copy of the resolution should be sent to Vendiola's last known address. Proof of proper notification should be ensured to mitigate any later claims of denial of due process.
