**Legal Document Summary: *Main T. Mohammad v. Office of the Secretary, Department of Justice***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 256116, February 27, 2024

**Nature of Document:** Decision on Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) assailing the denial of compensation claim under Republic Act No. 7309.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Main T. Mohammad (Claimant)
*   **Respondent:** Office of the Secretary, Department of Justice (DOJ)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 7309 (Victims of Unjust Imprisonment Act):**  Governs compensation claims.  Section 3(a) is central, defining eligible claimants as those "unjustly accused, convicted, and imprisoned but subsequently released by virtue of a judgment of acquittal."
*   **Claimant's Argument:** Mohammad argues Section 3(a)'s "and" should be interpreted disjunctively ("or") to cover those unjustly accused and imprisoned *even without* a conviction, especially when acquitted at the trial court level. Also claims a violation of the equal protection clause.
*   **DOJ's Position:**  The DOJ (Board of Claims and Secretary) interprets "and" conjunctively, requiring all elements (unjust accusation, conviction, imprisonment, and subsequent acquittal) to be met. They argue that a trial court acquittal, unlike an appellate court acquittal, does not establish *unjust* conviction.
* **Court Decision:** The Petition for Certiorari is denied, upholding the DOJ's interpretation. The Supreme Court held that the requirements are cumulative and that the elements of R.A. 7309 Section 3(a) were not met because Mohammad was never convicted. It cites *Basbacio v. Drilon* to distinguish between an erroneous judgment and an *unjust* judgment. Additionally, the Court applies the *Verba Legis* principle, holding that the clear and straightforward language of Section 3(a) of Republic Act No. 7309, and as such, there is no room for interpretation.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Claimant's Loss:** Mohammad is denied compensation.
*   **Strict Interpretation Risk:** The court's strict, literal interpretation of R.A. 7309 may exclude similarly situated claimants who suffer unjust accusations and detentions but are acquitted without a prior conviction. This poses a risk for potential future claimants.
*   **Discretionary Limitation Risk:** Broad interpretation of conviction may expose judicial officers to liability for rendering what is later shown to be in error.
*   **Equal Protection Challenge Fails:** Mohammad's constitutional challenge fails, reinforcing the existing interpretation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 7309, Section 3(a):** The core statutory provision.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Basis for the certiorari petition.
*   ***Basbacio v. Drilon, 308 Phil. 5 (1994)***:  Distinguishes between erroneous and unjust conviction.
*   ***Quinto v. Commission on Elections, 627 Phil. 193 (2010)***: Establishes that constitutionality of the law must be sustained, even if its reasonableness of the classification is "fairly debatable."
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Ariete, 624 Phil. 458 (2010)***: Defines and explains the conjunctive word "and."
*   ***People v. Sebilleno, 868 Phil. 374 (2020)***: Underscores stereotyping, profiling, and mistaken identity in the arrest of Muslims throughout the country.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "and" in Section 3(a):** The central point of contention. Mohammad argues for a disjunctive reading to cover cases of unjust accusation and detention even without conviction. The court rejects this.
*   **Definition of "Unjust":** Whether an acquittal by the trial court is sufficient to demonstrate that the prosecution was unjust, especially in cases with potential profiling and discrimination. The court's narrow view requires an appellate reversal of a conviction.

**Dissenting Opinion:**
*   **Justice Leonen** underscores the need to construe the law through different lenses, recognizing that freedoms should be meaningful.
* He dissents, stating that there are Muslim communities that are disproportionately victimized by law enforcement, leading to situations of mistaken identity. Moreover, that what is "unjust" under the law should be viewed through this lense and not solely rely on the need for a prior conviction and a subsequent judgment of acquittal by an appellate court.
