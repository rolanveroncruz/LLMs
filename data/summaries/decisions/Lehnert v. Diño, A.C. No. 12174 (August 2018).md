**Legal Document Summary: *Alfred Lehnert v. Atty. Dennis L. Diño***

**Case:** A.C. No. 12174, August 28, 2018 (Administrative Case before the Supreme Court of the Philippines)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against a lawyer.

**Complainant:** Alfred Lehnert

**Respondent:** Atty. Dennis L. Diño

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Violation of B.P. Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law):** Atty. Diño was charged with two counts of violating B.P. Blg. 22 for issuing dishonored checks to Lehnert.
*   **Evasion of Arrest:** A warrant of arrest was issued, but Atty. Diño could not be located at multiple addresses. The Court took note of Atty. Diño evading arrest.
*   **Non-Participation in IBP Proceedings:** Atty. Diño failed to appear or submit briefs in the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) disciplinary proceedings.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** The IBP Board of Governors adopted the Investigating Commissioner's recommendation to suspend Atty. Diño for two (2) years.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Obey Laws and Maintain Professional Standards:** Lawyers are obligated to obey the laws of the land (Canon 1, CPR) and avoid unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct (Rule 1.01, CPR).
*   **Financial Obligations:** Lawyers have a duty to promptly pay their financial obligations. *Lao v. Medel*, 453 Phil. 115 (2003) highlights that lawyers must faithfully perform their duties to society, the bar, the courts, and clients, including fulfilling financial obligations. Failure to do so reflects poorly on the legal profession.
*   **Cooperation in Disciplinary Proceedings:** Lawyers have an obligation to cooperate with disciplinary investigations. Failure to do so can be considered an aggravating factor.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **No Criminal Conviction:** The decision to suspend Atty. Diño was made *before* a criminal conviction for the B.P. Blg. 22 violations. The suspension is based on the IBP's finding of misconduct, not on a criminal conviction. This highlights the difference between criminal liability and administrative responsibility.
*   **Reliance on Prima Facie Evidence:** While the Court did not explicitly state reliance on prima facie guilt, the fact that the attorney evaded arrest, this could be inferred as part of the Court's reasoning for meting out the administrative penalty.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22:** The Bouncing Checks Law.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 1 & Rule 1.01:** The basis for finding Atty. Diño guilty of misconduct.
*   ***Lao v. Medel*, 453 Phil. 115 (2003):** (Financial Obligations) Stresses the duty of lawyers to fulfill their financial obligations.
*   ***Co v. Bernardino*, 349 Phil. 16 (1998):** (1-Year Suspension) The penalty of a one-year suspension for a "cavalier attitude toward incurring debts."
*   ***Wong v. Moya*, 590 Phil. 279 (2008):** (2-Year Suspension) The penalty of a two-year suspension for issuing worthless checks and disregarding the IBP's orders.

**Outcome:**

*   Atty. Diño was suspended from the practice of law for two (2) years.

**Advice/Action Items:**

*   The Court's decision emphasizes the importance of lawyers fulfilling their financial obligations, upholding the law, and cooperating with disciplinary proceedings.
*   The Court is likely to impose harsher penalties for future violations of the CPR.
*   Lawyers must adhere to the CPR and prioritize settling any financial obligations to prevent administrative cases that could potentially affect their license to practice law.
*   The Court views issuing worthless checks as gross misconduct.
