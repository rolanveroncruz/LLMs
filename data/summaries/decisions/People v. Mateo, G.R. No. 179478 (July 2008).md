## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mateo, G.R. No. 179478 (2008)

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Jinggoy Mateo y Rodriguez

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of 0.20 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu").

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Accusation:** Mateo was charged with and convicted of selling "shabu" in a buy-bust operation.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented testimony from PO2 Ortiz, the poseur-buyer, who detailed the buy-bust operation. The shabu was tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   **Defense:** Mateo claimed he was arrested outside his house after leaving a comfort room and denied any involvement in drug sale. His neighbor corroborated his story.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Mateo guilty, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000. The RTC gave weight to the positive identification by the poseur-buyer and gave credence to the presumption that the public officers performed their duties regularly.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, upholding the credibility of the prosecution's witness and upholding the buy-bust operation.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied Mateo's appeal, affirming the CA decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mateo:** Obligated to serve life imprisonment and pay a fine of P500,000 for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.
*   **State:** Obligated to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, which the Court found was satisfied.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** Mateo argued that the police failed to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding the handling and preservation of evidence (inventory, photography, required witnesses). He claimed this jeopardized the integrity of the seized drug.
*   **Delayed Raising of Issue:** The Supreme Court noted that Mateo raised the chain of custody issue for the first time on appeal. This delayed raising of the issue resulted in the dismissal of the argument.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court relied on the presumption that police officers properly performed their duties during the buy-bust operation, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. This presumption weighed heavily against Mateo's defense.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Penalizes the sale, trading, delivery, etc. of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Concerns the custody and disposition of seized drugs (integrity of evidence).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Norberto del Monte y Gapay @ Obet, G.R No. 179940, 23 April 2008:** Non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 does not automatically render the seized drugs inadmissible.
*   **People v. Pringas, G.R. No. 175928, 31 August 2007, 531 SCRA 828:** Non-compliance with Section 21 is not fatal as long as there is justifiable ground therefor, and as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the confiscated/seized items, are properly preserved.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The specific justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21, as alluded to in jurisprudence, are not explicitly defined.
*   The definition of "integrity and evidentiary value" of the seized items requires further clarification on how the court defines what makes evidence of probative value.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, prioritizing the testimony of the poseur-buyer and the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. While the chain of custody issue was raised, its delayed presentation and the lack of compelling evidence to undermine the prosecution's case proved fatal to Mateo's appeal.
