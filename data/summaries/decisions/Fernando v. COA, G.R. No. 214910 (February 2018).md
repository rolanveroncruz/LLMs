## Legal Document Summary: *Fernando v. Commission on Audit* (G.R. No. 214910)

**Case Overview:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a COA decision that disallowed portions of payments made by the MMDA to William L. Tan Construction (WLTC) for the Design and Construction of Steel Pedestrian Bridges due to delays and cost variances. The COA held WLTC and responsible MMDA officials solidarily liable for the disallowed amount.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Contract:** MMDA contracted with WLTC for the design and construction of 14 steel pedestrian bridges for P196,291,834.71, to be completed in 120 calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).
*   **Suspension Orders (SOs) & Resume Orders (ROs):** MMDA issued multiple SOs and ROs, impacting the contract timeline. The validity of these orders is a central point of contention.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** The contract stipulated liquidated damages for delays. COA assessed higher damages than initially computed by MMDA.
*   **Contract Cost Variance:** WLTC claimed additional costs for manpower and equipment to expedite project completion, which the COA disallowed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **WLTC:** Primarily liable for delays and any breach of contract (e.g., unauthorized subcontracting). Specifically liable for P18,153,348.63 in liquidated damages.
*   **MMDA Officials:** Held solidarily liable for the disallowed amounts due to negligence in authorizing payments without properly accounting for delays, cost variances, and potential contract violations (Section 43, Chapter V, Book VI of the Administrative Code of 1987 & Section 103 of PD 1445). The officers originally named in the ND are listed in the contents.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Suspension Orders:** The Court agreed with COA that the initial Suspension Order was issued prematurely (before the contract was even executed) and that the reasons for the suspension orders were inherent risks of the project, undermining the extensions of time granted.
*   **Contract Time Extension & Performance Security:** The approved contract time extension was not covered by the required performance security under RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act), rendering it invalid.
*   **Unapproved Subcontracting:** WLTC's subcontracting without proper approval violated the contract terms.
*   **Cost Variance Justification:**  The claimed cost variance for increased manpower/equipment deployment was deemed unjustified as it was incurred to rectify WLTC's own delays.
*   **Authority of Project Manager:** While the court acknowledged the authority of the Project Manager, Ramon S. Ona, to issue SOs and ROs, this authority does not preclude the COA from reviewing these actions and ensuring conformity with the law.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Performance security requirements for contract extensions.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines):** Section 82 (Maturity of Suspension into Disallowance), Section 103 (Personal liability for illegal expenditures).
*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292):**  Book VI, Chapter V, Section 43 (Liability for Expenditures in Violation of the Code).
*   **COA Circular No. 94-001:** Prescribes use of the Manual on Certificate of Settlement and Balances
*   **Filipinas (Pre-Fab Building) Systems, Inc. v. MRT Development Corporation:** (G.R. Nos. 167829-30) Project manager’s discretion on technical matters.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   Differing interpretations of contract effectivity and delay calculation based on the validity of the SOs.
*   Whether the MMDA's actions constituted gross negligence in approving disbursements.
* The extent to which reliance on the Project Manager’s judgement could be seen as excusable negligence in the approval of these orders.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court AFFIRMED the COA decision, upholding the disallowance as modified by the COA Proper and holding WLTC and the responsible MMDA officials solidarily liable. The Court emphasized the COA's constitutional duty to audit public funds and the accountability of public officers for negligent disbursement of those funds.
