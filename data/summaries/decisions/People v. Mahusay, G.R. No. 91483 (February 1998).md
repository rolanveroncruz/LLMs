**Case Summary: People v. Mahusay & Paspos, G.R. No. 91483 (1998)**

**Type:** Criminal Case (Robbery with Rape) - Decision Clarification/Modification

**Key Provisions & Ruling:**

*   **Original Ruling:** The Supreme Court initially affirmed the trial court's conviction of both Samuel Mahusay and Cristituto Paspos for robbery with rape, sentencing each to three (3) terms of *reclusion perpetua* and ordering them to indemnify Maria Luisa Bughao P50,000 each (citing *People v. Malabago, G.R. No. 108693, April 18, 1997; People v. Romua, G.R. No. 126175, May 29, 1997* regarding indemnity amount).

*   **Modification:** The Court modified its decision to remove Samuel Mahusay from the ruling. This was due to Mahusay withdrawing his appeal on May 12, 1995, which was granted by the court in a resolution dated July 17, 1995.

*   **Final Ruling:** Cristituto Paspos' conviction and sentence of three (3) terms of *reclusion perpetua* for robbery with rape is affirmed. He is ordered to indemnify Maria Luisa Bughao P50,000. Samuel Mahusay is no longer part of the appeal.

**Obligations:**

*   Cristituto Paspos is obligated to serve the sentence of three (3) terms of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Cristituto Paspos is obligated to pay Maria Luisa Bughao P50,000 as indemnity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Cristituto Paspos faces criminal liability for the crime of robbery with rape.
*   Cristituto Paspos faces civil liability in the form of indemnity to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Concerns:**

*   **Enforcement:** Ensuring enforcement of the reclusion perpetua sentence and the payment of indemnity by Paspos.
*   **Double Jeopardy (Minor):** Though unlikely considering Mahusay initiated the withdrawal, one could theoretically assess if re-opening Mahusay's case in the future after entry of judgement on withdrawal could pose double jeopardy concerns, though it seems implausible here.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ruling is clear. There are no apparent ambiguities or contentious clauses. The modification addresses the procedural issue of Mahusay's withdrawal of his appeal.
