**Case Summary: Ejercito vs. M.R. Vargas Construction, G.R. No. 172595 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari against the RTC's Order nullifying proceedings due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Facts:** Petitioners filed an injunction suit against M.R. Vargas Construction, a sole proprietorship, represented by Marcial Vargas (owner) and Renato Agarao (foreman), to stop tree cutting. Summons was returned unserved as the business was not found at the address. Agarao appeared at a hearing for a TRO. The RTC initially granted the TRO but later nullified all proceedings, finding a lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction over the Person:** The central issue is whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over the person of Marcial Vargas, the owner and real party-in-interest, given that M.R. Vargas Construction is a sole proprietorship without separate juridical personality. The court emphasizes that jurisdiction is acquired through valid service of summons *or* voluntary appearance.
*   **Service of Summons (Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7):**  Personal service or substituted service on Marcial Vargas was required but never achieved.  The court stresses strict compliance with these Rules. `Pinlac v. Court of Appeals, 402 Phil. 684 (2001)`
*   **Service on Entities Without Juridical Personality (Rule 14, Section 8 - Analogous Application Argued):** Petitioners unsuccessfully argued that service on foreman Agarao sufficed, analogizing to service on associated persons in an entity without juridical personality under Rule 14, Section 8. The court rejected this, noting Agarao's lack of authority to represent the sole proprietorship owner.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:**  Agarao's attendance at the TRO hearing *did not* constitute a voluntary appearance by Vargas submitting to the court's jurisdiction. Attendance alone, without a positive act indicating intent to submit to jurisdiction, is insufficient. `Herrera-Felix v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143736 (2004)`
*   **Waiver of Jurisdiction:** Respondent's initial withdrawal of the jurisdiction argument, based on a mistaken belief that Vargas received the summons, did not constitute a waiver.  Upon discovering that petitioner Martinez had signed for the summons, the objection was reasserted. `French Oil Mill Machinery Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 356 Phil. 780 (1998)`

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:**  To properly serve summons on the real party-in-interest (Marcial Vargas), in accordance with Rule 14, Sections 6 and 7, to establish jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Defective Service:** The failure to properly serve summons on the correct party (Marcial Vargas) rendered all subsequent proceedings null and void, exposing the client (Ejercito, et al.) to potential delays and increased legal costs due to the need to refile the case.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Mangila v. Court of Appeals, 435 Phil. 870 (2002):**  Reinforces the principle that a sole proprietorship lacks juridical personality.
*   **Litonjua Group of Companies v. Vigan, 412 Phil. 627 (2001):** Only natural or juridical persons or entities authorized by law may be parties to a civil action.
*   **Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 130974 (2006):** Discusses the modes of acquiring jurisdiction.
*   **Sandoval II v. HRET, 433 Phil. 290 (2002):** Strict compliance of Rules of Court on service of summons.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial mistaken withdrawal of the objection to jurisdiction caused potential confusion and could have led to a different outcome had counsel not promptly corrected the record.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, emphasizing the importance of proper service of summons and the limitations on representing entities without juridical personality. The failure to serve Marcial Vargas personally or through substituted service resulted in a lack of jurisdiction, nullifying the trial court proceedings. The key takeaway is the strict adherence to the Rules of Court regarding service of summons, particularly when dealing with sole proprietorships.
