## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Grano et al.*, G.R. No. 167710

**Case Overview:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari filed by the People of the Philippines, challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of its petition for certiorari. The CA dismissed the petition which questioned the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) modification of its original decision, which found Joven de Grano, Armando de Grano, Domingo Landicho, and Estanislao Lacaba guilty of murder. The RTC modified its decision to acquit Joven and Armando, and downgrade Domingo and Estanislao's conviction to homicide. The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari by the People.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Original Charge:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code
*   **Trial in Absentia & Loss of Remedies:** Sec. 6, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court (now Sec. 6, Rule 120, 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure) states that an accused who fails to appear at promulgation without justifiable cause loses available remedies. A motion for leave to avail of remedies can be filed within 15 days of promulgation by the accused.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The core issue is whether modifying the original judgment of conviction by acquitting two accused and downgrading the conviction of the other two constitutes double jeopardy, barring the State's petition for certiorari. The elements of double jeopardy are (1) a valid complaint/information, (2) jurisdiction, (3) arraignment and plea, and (4) acquittal/conviction or dismissal without consent.
*   **Standing to File Motion for Reconsideration:** The legal issue centers around whether the RTC correctly entertained the "Joint Motion for Reconsideration" considering Joven and Armando were at large at the promulgation. The Supreme Court held that having failed to appear without justifiable cause at promulgation, they lost their standing to file a motion for reconsideration.
*   **Procedural Technicalities:** The CA dismissed the initial petition due to lack of verification by the offended party and lack of explicit conformity by the Solicitor General (OSG). The Court addressed this issue by allowing a liberal application of the Rules of Court for verification and non-forum shopping in a petition for certiorari due to valid fear for the life of the complainant. The Court also held that the OSG did conform to the filing of the Petition.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion by the RTC:** The People argued that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it entertained the joint motion for reconsideration despite some accused being at large. The Supreme Court agreed, citing that it acted without jurisdiction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Joven de Grano, Armando de Grano, Domingo Landicho:** Initially liable for murder; RTC's modified order finding two not guilty and reducing the charge of the other, as stated above, was improper and invalid.
*   **Estanislao Lacaba:** While initially found guilty of murder, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision to downgrade his conviction to homicide as he was present for promulgation.
*  **Judge Teresa P. Soriaso:** Possibly liable for violation of law and/or the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy Exception:** The finding of grave abuse of discretion is crucial because it removes the double jeopardy bar. However, the showing of grave abuse of discretion needs to be clear and convincing.
*   **Interpretation of "Justifiable Cause":** The success of a motion for leave to avail of these remedies relies heavily on whether their "justifiable cause" for absence is credible enough.
*   **Factual Findings & Certiorari:** The Supreme Court is generally reluctant to review factual findings in a certiorari proceeding, limiting its scope to jurisdictional errors.
*   **Continuing Jurisdiction:** It is clear that Estanislao properly invoked jurisdiction of the court. But Joven, and Armando will probably argue that they were not fugitives, since they were not officially charged with the crime during the time they were absent from court, and so still had continuing jurisdiction of the court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Murder (Article 248)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Certiorari), Rule 120 (Judgment)
*   **Constitution:** Article III, Section 14(2) (Trial in Absentia)
*   *Yuchengco v. Court of Appeals*: Exception to Double Jeopardy
*  *People v. Tampal*: Elements of double jeopardy
*   *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals*: Liberal interpretation of rules in the interest of justice.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition. The CA Resolutions were reversed and set aside. The RTC's modified order convicting Domingo Landicho of homicide and acquitting Armando de Grano and Joven de Grano was annulled. The original decision finding them guilty of murder was reinstated.

**Next Steps:**

This analysis informs that Domingo, Armando, and Joven are all once again charged with murder. So the case will continue to proceed with a murder charge, but can only proceed against Estanislao with a charge of homicide. The Court further ordered an investigation into Judge Soriaso's actions for potential violations of the law and judicial conduct.
