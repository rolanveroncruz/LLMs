**Legal Document Summary: People v. Plaza y Bucalon, G.R. No. 176933 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's order granting bail to the accused, Luis Plaza, who was charged with Murder.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Bail Eligibility:** The central issue is whether Plaza was properly granted bail. The prosecution argues that because he was charged with Murder, a non-bailable offense *unless* evidence of guilt is not strong, a full bail hearing was mandatory. The defense successfully argued that the prior judge's (Judge Buyser) finding during the demurrer that the prosecution's evidence only supported a charge of Homicide (a bailable offense) justified the grant of bail.
*   **Demurrer Ruling Effect:**  The case hinges on the legal effect of Judge Buyser's *obiter dictum* in her Order denying the Demurrer to Evidence, stating the prosecution proved only Homicide. This statement was used to justify the grant of bail, and the Court ultimately finds that the subsequent Judge (Judge Tan) was justified in not holding a separate bail hearing based on this assessment.
*   **Necessity of a Bail Hearing:** The prosecution argued that the grant of bail without a separate hearing to determine the strength of the evidence was a violation of due process and settled jurisprudence. The Supreme Court disagreed, noting that the prior judge's assessment of the prosecution's case negated the need for another full-fledged hearing.
*   **Application for Bail:** The prosecution contended that a formal 'application for bail' was not filed by the accused.  The Court of Appeals considered the "Motion to Fix Amount of Bail Bond" as the application for bail.

**Obligations:**

*   The State has the obligation to prove that the accused is not entitled to bail based on the strength of the evidence against him for the crime charged (Murder).
*   The Court has the obligation to conduct a hearing (if needed) to determine the strength of evidence, especially in capital offenses, before granting bail.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability of the Judge if bail is granted inappropriately for a non-bailable offense.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge Buyser's Order on Demurrer:**  The statement in Judge Buyser's order regarding the strength of the evidence presents a contentious point. The prosecution argued it was merely an opinion and not a dispositive portion.
*   **Section 5, Rule 114 Argument:** The prosecution's reliance on Section 5, Rule 114 is misplaced as that section applies to bail applications *after* conviction in the Regional Trial Court.
*   **Lack of Bail Hearing:** The absence of a formal bail hearing, relying instead on the statement made by the judge during the demurrer proceeding. This could be seen as a procedural shortcut.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 13:** Guarantees the right to bail except when charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 114, Section 4:** Defines when bail is a matter of right.
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 114, Section 5:**  Deals with bail after conviction in the Regional Trial Court (not applicable in this case).
*   **People v. Ako, Jr.**  (cited by the Court):  Details the nature of a summary hearing for bail purposes.
*   **Basco v. Rapatalo, 269 SCRA 220, 233 (1997)** This case helps define a summary hearing and its role in determining bail eligibility

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the grant of bail, finding that Judge Tan properly relied on Judge Buyser's assessment of the prosecution's evidence during the demurrer, making a separate bail hearing unnecessary. The key legal issue is whether the statement made in the Demurrer order regarding the type of crime supported by the evidence was sufficient for the trial judge to make the decision to grant bail without a separate hearing. The Prosecution loses.
