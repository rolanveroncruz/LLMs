## Legal Document Summary: Unchuan v. Lozada, G.R. No. 172671 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order reinstating its original decision. The dispute concerns ownership of land initially co-owned by sisters Anita Lozada Slaughter and Peregrina Lozada Saribay.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Deed of Sale Validity:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the validity of the Deed of Sale between the Lozada sisters and their nephew, Antonio J.P. Lozada. The notarized and authenticated deed carries a presumption of regularity. The SC rejected arguments that the sale violated public policy due to alleged alien ownership (Dr. Lozada advancing funds).
*   **Philippine National Status (RA 7042):** The SC invoked Republic Act No. 7042, emphasizing that a corporation with at least 60% Filipino ownership can acquire disposable lands.  The proposed incorporation of the land into Damasa Corporation, with Dr. Lozada holding a minority stake (40%), did not invalidate the sale.
*   **Deed of Donation Invalidity:** The SC affirmed the invalidity of the Deed of Donation from Anita to Marissa Unchuan. It failed to comply with Article 749 of the Civil Code (requiring a public document for immovable property donations), particularly regarding proper notarization and record-keeping. Alterations to the notarization date and lack of registration in the Notarial Records Division were fatal. Citing Rules of Court Rule 132 Section 31, the SC rejected the admissibility due to the alteration of the documents authenticity.
*   **Peregrina's Capacity:** The SC declined to re-calibrate factual findings regarding Peregrina's physical capacity to execute the Deed of Sale, deferring to the lower courts' findings based on the available evidence. The SC addressed concerns that medical records presented by the petitioner lacked authentication, citing a certification from the hospital denying their official status (citing  S. A.F. APOSTOL, ESSENTIALS OF EVIDENCE 438 (1991)).
*   **Hearsay & Admissions:** The SC addressed the issue of Anita's videotaped statement. While acknowledging hearsay concerns, it classified the statement as an *admission* by a party (Section 26, Rule 130), typically admissible. However, it ultimately excluded the videotape for lack of authentication, *i.e.*, testimony establishing it was a faithful reproduction (citing *S. A.F. APOSTOL, ESSENTIALS OF EVIDENCE 63 (1991)*).
*   **Damages:** The SC reversed the CA's award of moral and exemplary damages to the respondents, finding no factual and legal basis for them. Good faith litigation does not warrant damages (citing *Filinvest Credit Corporation v. Mendez, No. L-66419, July 31, 1987, 152 SCRA 593, 601*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Antonio J.P. Lozada:** Declared the absolute owner of the properties.
*   **Marissa R. Unchuan:** Directed to surrender the void Deed of Donation for cancellation.  Her counterclaims were dismissed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Alien Land Ownership Issues:** Although resolved in favor of Lozada, the case highlights potential scrutiny of real estate transactions involving foreign nationals indirectly. While the structure avoided direct violation, a more aggressive or opaque arrangement might face greater challenges. The burden of proof of capacity to pay for the lots still remains.
*   **Notarization and Authentication:** The case underscores the critical importance of proper notarization and authentication of documents, especially for real estate transactions. The defective Deed of Donation demonstrates the potential for invalidity based on technical flaws. Citing CIVIL CODE, Art. 1356, that when the law requires a contract to be in some form, the requirement is indispensable.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The evidentiary rulings on medical records and the videotaped statement illustrate the importance of proper authentication and the limitations of hearsay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Art. 749:**  Donation of immovable property requirements.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1356:** Requirement of specific form for validity of contracts.
*   **Republic Act No. 7042 (Foreign Investments Act):** Definition of "Philippine National" and land ownership by corporations.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 26:**  Admissions of a party.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 3(m):** Presumption of regularity of official duty performed.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 31:** Altered Documents
*   **Filinvest Credit Corporation v. Mendez, No. L-66419, July 31, 1987, 152 SCRA 593, 601:** Good faith litigation does not warrant damages.
