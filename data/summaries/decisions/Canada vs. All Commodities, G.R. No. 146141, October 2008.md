**Case Summary: *Ernesto Canada v. All Commodities Marketing Corporation***

**Citation:** 590 Phil. 342 (G.R. No. 146141, October 17, 2008)

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Ernesto Canada (Hi-Ball Freight Services) - Trucking/Hauling Services.
*   Respondent: All Commodities Marketing Corporation - Client.

**Facts:**

*   Respondent contracted Petitioner to haul 1,000 sacks of sugar.
*   Petitioner's drivers failed to deliver the sugar, and vanished.
*   Respondent sued to recover the value of the lost sugar (Civil Case No. 18826, RTC Makati).

**Procedural History:**

*   RTC ruled in favor of Respondent, ordering Petitioner to pay damages.
*   CA affirmed the RTC decision.
*   Petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:**  The existence of a contract of carriage between Petitioner and Respondent is central.  While the Waybills/Delivery Receipts referenced All Star Transport, Inc. (All Star), the Supreme Court found Petitioner ultimately responsible due to admissions made at the trial court level.
*   **Delivery Obligation:** Petitioner had a clear obligation to deliver the 1,000 sacks of sugar. Failure to deliver constituted a breach of contract.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Original RTC Award:** P350,000 (value of sugar), P50,000 (unearned income, etc.), P50,000 (exemplary), 20% attorney's fees + per appearance fee.
*   **Supreme Court Modification:**  The Supreme Court *deleted* the actual damages of P350,000 and P50,000 due to lack of sufficient proof of pecuniary loss. Instead, the Supreme Court awarded **temperate damages of P250,000.** P50,000 in exemplary damages was maintained. Attorney's fees were reduced to P50,000.
*   **Interest:** Legal interest of 6% per annum from the date of the trial court's decision, and 12% per annum from finality of the Supreme Court decision until full satisfaction.

**Legal Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Estoppel:**  The Supreme Court upheld the CA ruling that Petitioner was estopped from denying the contract on appeal, as he had admitted the contract at the trial level and presented a different defense (delivery, fortuitous event). *See Ulep v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125254, October 11, 2005, 472 SCRA 241*.
*   **Judicial Admissions (Rule 129, Section 4, Rules of Court):** Petitioner's admissions in his answer and during trial were binding and could not be contradicted absent palpable mistake.
*   **Caso Fortuito:**  The Supreme Court rejected the defense of *caso fortuito* (fortuitous event) because Petitioner failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the elements required for this defense. *See Perla Compania De Seguros, Inc. v. Sarangaya III, G.R. No. 147746, October 25, 2005, 474 SCRA 191*.
*   **Actual Damages:** The Court reiterated that actual damages must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty; mere allegation is insufficient. *See V.V. Soliven Realty Corporation v. Ong, G.R. No. 147869, January 26, 2005, 449 SCRA 339*. *B.F. Metal (Corporation) v. Sps. Rolando M. Lomotan, G.R. No. 170813, April 16, 2008.*
*   **Temperate Damages (Article 2224, Civil Code):** Allowed when some pecuniary loss is proven but the amount cannot be determined with certainty. *See Premiere Development Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 159352, April 14, 2004, 427 SCRA 686*.
*   **Exemplary Damages (Article 2234, Civil Code):** Awarded because temperate damages were awarded. *See Republic v. Tuvera, G.R. No. 148246, February 16, 2007, 516 SCRA 113*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity of All Star's Role:**  The presence of All Star's name on the Waybills created an initial ambiguity, but the court dismissed this due to Petitioner's prior admissions and change of legal theory.
*   **Proof of Actual Damages:** Respondent's failure to adequately prove actual damages significantly reduced the monetary award. This highlights the necessity of thorough documentation of losses.

**Summary Judgment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision with modifications, upholding the finding that Ernesto Canada (Hi-Ball Freight Services) was liable for the loss of the sugar. While the original award of actual damages was reversed, the court granted temperate and exemplary damages, along with attorney's fees. The key takeaway is the importance of consistency in legal arguments and the need for concrete proof of actual losses to support damage claims.
