## Legal Document Summary: Cruz v. Cruz, G.R. No. 211153 (2018)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of an Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Central Issue:** Validity of a 1986 Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate involving a 940 sq. m. property inherited by siblings from their parents, specifically concerning the allocation of unequal shares.
*   **Unequal Distribution:** One heir, Antonia (now deceased, represented by petitioners), received two lots while other heirs (including respondent Concepcion) received one each.
*   **Vitiated Consent (Focus of CA Ruling):** Respondent Concepcion claimed she was induced to sign the settlement (written in English) without understanding its contents due to illiteracy (Grade 3 education) and reliance on her sister Amparo.
*   **Prescription (Focus of Petition):** Petitioners argued the action to annul the settlement had prescribed under Art. 1144 of the Civil Code (10-year period for written contracts). The CA applied a 4-year period from discovery of fraud.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court ultimately *denied* the petition but **differed in its reasoning from the CA**. While upholding the annulment, it found the Extrajudicial Settlement was a *total nullity* due to the **exclusion** of an heir from receiving their rightful share, rather than solely on the basis of fraud (which implies vitiated consent).  Therefore, the action does not prescribe.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Heirs of Antonia):** Have an obligation to return the extra lot received by their predecessor. Liable for costs of suit.
*   **Respondents (Remaining Heirs):** Entitled to an equal share of the estate as per Art. 980 of the Civil Code, including accretion from renounced shares.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation and Partition:** Determining the specific value of each lot and implementing the partition to ensure equal distribution could be challenging.  The decision doesn't provide guidance on how to re-partition the property.
*   **Good Faith Purchasers:** The decision appears to affect only the division between the heirs. The decision discusses validity of sales only up to proportional shares (citing Neri v. Heirs of Hadji Yusop Uy). This leaves the position of 3rd party purchasers unclear.
* **Subsequent Acts:** The dissenting Judge held that the respondent's actions belied her claim in that they did not object when petitioners built their home on the lots and never registered any objection even during family gatherings and occasions.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 980, Civil Code:** Equal inheritance rights of children.
*   **Art. 1015-1020, Civil Code:** Accretion.
*   **Rule 74, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Extrajudicial settlement must include all heirs.
*   **Art. 1144, Civil Code:** Statute of limitations (written contracts - argued by petitioners).
*   **Art. 1332, Civil Code:** Protection for parties unable to read.
*   **Art. 1410, Civil Code:** An action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Bautista v. Bautista (2007):** Invalidity of extrajudicial partition excluding heirs.
*   **Neri v. Heirs of Hadji Yusop Uy (2012):** Invalidity of extrajudicial settlement excluding heirs; sale valid only up to proportionate share.
*   **Segura v. Segura (1988):** Extrajudicial settlement not binding on those who didn't participate.
*   **The Roman Catholic Bishop of Tuguegarao v. Prudencio (2016):** Exclusion of heirs renders extrajudicial partition a nullity.
*   **Gerona v. De Guzman (1964):** (Cited in the CA decision) 4 year prescriptive period from discovery of fraud.

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The lack of specific instructions on *how* to re-partition the property could lead to further disputes.
*   The decision's silence on the possible rights or claims of *bona fide purchasers* of portions of the property could result in future litigation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the respondent Concepcion, declaring the 1986 Extrajudicial Settlement null and void due to the effective exclusion of one heir from receiving their rightful share to the estate, and not by determining that the contract was defective for vitiated consent due to fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or mistake. This ruling emphasizes the importance of ensuring all heirs participate and receive equal shares in intestate succession. The primary risk moving forward is in re-partitioning the property.
