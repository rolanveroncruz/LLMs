## Legal Document Summary: Ugdoracion v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 179851)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision, Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 64.

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's cancellation of petitioner Jose Ugdoracion, Jr.'s Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for Mayor due to material misrepresentation. Ugdoracion, a "green card" holder (US permanent resident), stated in his COC that he was a resident of Albuquerque, Bohol for 41 years and not a permanent resident/immigrant to a foreign country.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 74 & 78, Omnibus Election Code:**  Requires truthfulness in COCs regarding eligibility. False material representations are grounds for cancellation.
*   **Residency Requirement:**  Candidates must meet residency requirements for the office sought.
*   **Permanent Resident Status Disqualification:** Section 68, Omnibus Election Code and Section 40(f), Local Government Code disqualifies permanent residents/immigrants of foreign countries unless status is waived.
*   **Waiver of Permanent Resident Status:** The Court affirms the COMELEC's decision to invalidate the petitioner's submitted documentation as sufficient waiver of his permanent residency status in the United States.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Cancellation of COC:** Making false statements in the COC results in the cancellation of the COC and removal from the ballot.
*   **Disqualification from Office:** If elected, a candidate with a cancelled COC is disqualified from holding the office.
*   **Prosecution for Election Law Violations:**  False representations in the COC may lead to prosecution.
*   **Reliance on incomplete/unauthenticated documents:** Submission of photocopied, unauthenticated documents as proof of abandonment of permanent residency poses legal challenges.
*   **Incomplete fulfilment of residency requirements:** Failure to adhere to the minimum residency requirements of the position that is being run for may result in ineligibility for the office.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Caasi v. Court of Appeals (191 SCRA 229):** Acquisition of permanent resident status abroad constitutes abandonment of domicile and residence in the Philippines. It also entails the need to waiver of status as a greencard holder through acts independent of and prior to filing of the COC.
*   **Salcedo II v. COMELEC (312 SCRA 447) & Lluz v. COMELEC (523 SCRA 456):**  Define material misrepresentation as pertaining to qualifications for elective office. Requires a deliberate attempt to mislead or hide facts rendering a candidate ineligible.
*   **Gayo v. Verceles (452 SCRA 504):** A "green card" status in the USA is a renunciation of one's status as a resident of the Philippines
*   **Mercado v. Manzano (307 SCRA 630):** Permanent Residency is not bestowed by operation of law but by a voluntary application.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Involuntary" Acquisition of Green Card:** Ugdoracion argued his acquisition was involuntary, resulting from his sister's petition. The Court rejected this, stating the acceptance of permanent residency is voluntary.
*   **Sufficiency of Waiver:** The COMELEC and Court found Ugdoracion's "Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status" (photocopy, unauthenticated) insufficient to prove a valid waiver before filing his COC and failure to meet the one-year residency requirement after abandonment.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **Focus on Proof of Waiver:** To overcome a disqualification based on prior permanent residency abroad, emphasize unequivocal proof of a valid, timely waiver of that status, predating the filing of the COC and meeting the residency requirements.
*   **Challenge the 'Deliberate Intent' Requirement:** While difficult, argue against a "deliberate intent to mislead" if evidence suggests a good-faith belief in one's eligibility, though the explicit requirement to disclose permanent resident status in the COC weakens this argument.

**Overall, this case reinforces the importance of complete and truthful disclosure in COCs and the legal consequences of holding permanent resident status in a foreign country without proper waiver, particularly in relation to residency requirements.**
