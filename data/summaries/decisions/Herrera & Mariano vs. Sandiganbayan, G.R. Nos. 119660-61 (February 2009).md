## Legal Document Summary: *Pat. Edgardo Herrera y Baltoribio and Pat. Redentor Mariano y Antonio v. Sandiganbayan and People of the Philippines* G.R. Nos. 119660-61 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan conviction for two counts of murder.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Pat. Edgardo Herrera and Pat. Redentor Mariano (Police Officers)
*   **Respondents:** Sandiganbayan and People of the Philippines

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Charges:** Petitioners, along with two other police officers (Barrera and Alcalde), were charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of Shi Shu Yang and George Go y Tan.  The original Informations lacked the allegation that the crimes were committed "in relation to their office."
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The initial defense strategy centered on the Sandiganbayan's lack of jurisdiction because the original Informations did not allege that the crimes were committed "in relation to their office" (citing *Bartolome v. People*).
*   **Amendment of Informations:** The Sandiganbayan ordered the amendment of the Informations to include the phrase "committing the offense in relation to their public position or office." The Petitioners then withdrew jurisdictional objections and adopted the bail proceedings evidence.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Key witnesses, including Reynaldo Ong (manager of the victim's restaurant) and Cristina Winterhalter (eyewitness), testified regarding the events leading up to and including the shooting.  Medico-legal evidence and forensic reports were also presented. Winterhalter testified she saw the petitioners along with Barrera and Alcalde shoot the victims at close range. Autopsy reports showed the victims suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Paraffin tests showed the victims were negative for nitrates.
*   **Defense Evidence:** The defense presented evidence attempting to establish self-defense and challenging the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses. The petitioners testified that the shooting occurred during an altercation while transporting the victims and they acted in self-defense.
*   **Sandiganbayan Decision:** The Sandiganbayan convicted the petitioners of two counts of murder, qualified by treachery and with aggravating circumstances including abuse of public position, superior strength, in band, and use of a motor vehicle. They were sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay damages.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  The central issue is the criminal liability of Herrera and Mariano for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.  Their actions, whether direct or through conspiracy, are critical to establishing their guilt.
*   **Civil Liability:** The petitioners are held jointly and severally liable for damages to the heirs of the victims, including actual damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, and civil indemnity.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** Petitioners argued that the amendment of the informations and rearraignment placed them in double jeopardy.  The Court rejects this, stating that the first requirement for double jeopardy to attach, that is, that the informations against the petitioners were valid, has not been complied with. The amended information cured a jurisdictional defect.
*   **Credibility of Eyewitness Testimony:** The defense challenged the credibility of Winterhalter, the key eyewitness.  The court emphasized the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and found no compelling reason to overturn it.  The witness received death threats, strengthening her crediblity and showing the risk she took to testify.
*   **Self-Defense Claim:** The defense asserted self-defense.  The court rejected this argument because the victims were handcuffed, unarmed, and sustained multiple gunshot wounds, indicating a "determined effort to kill." The court emphasized the high burden of proof for the self-defense claim, requiring unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of force, and lack of provocation.
*   **Conspiracy:** The prosecution successfully argued that the petitioners acted in conspiracy.  The court cited the familiar rule in conspiracy is that when two or more persons agree or conspire to commit a crime, each is responsible, when the conspiracy is proven, for all the acts of the others, done in furtherance of the conspiracy. The court inferred conspiracy from the petitioners' actions, including driving to a less conspicuous location, assisting in removing the victims, and failing to prevent the shooting.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Petitioners claimed the presumption of regularity in the performance of official acts. The Court rejected this as the evidence showed excessive force and a clear intent to kill.
*    **Damages Awarded:**  The Court clarified and increased the damages awarded, holding that the lack of an award of damages in favor of the heirs of the victims in the Sandiganbayan's decision to be in error. The Court awarded civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, and actual damages to the heirs of the victims.
