## Legal Document Summary: *XYST Corporation v. DMC Urban Properties Development Inc.* (G.R. No. 171968)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing a RTC decision dismissing a complaint for specific performance and damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether a perfected contract existed between XYST Corporation (XYST) and DMC Urban Properties Development, Inc. (DMC) for the sale of the 18th floor of the Citibank Tower.

**Holding:** No perfected contract existed. The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision, except for the award of attorney's fees to DMC.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **DMC's Initial Offer:** DMC offered to sell the 18th floor to Saint Agen Et Fils Limited (SAEFL), represented by William Seitz, outlined in a September 14, 1994 letter.  Key terms included property description, selling price (P53,500/sqm saleable area, total P99,831,000), VAT responsibility (dependent on payment timing), and payment terms (reservation fee, percentages due on specific dates).
*   **Citibank's Right of First Refusal:** DMC required Citibank's consent for any sale, as per their agreement.
*   **XYST's Involvement:** After learning that foreign acqusition of the 18th floor was not allowed, the deal with SAEFL fell through. Instead, XYST Corporation, a domestic corporation with Seitz as a director and shareholder, stepped in. XYST paid a reservation fee.
*   **XYST's Counter-Offer:** XYST, upon receiving a pro-forma Contract to Sell, proposed amendments, particularly regarding Citibank's conformity. This was deemed a counteroffer.
*   **DMC's Termination:** Due to inability to secure Citibank's agreement to XYST's amendments, DMC called off the deal and offered to return the reservation fee.

**Liabilities/Responsibilities:**

*   **DMC:** Initially obligated to seek Citibank's consent. Ultimately responsible for returning the reservation fee since the sale did not materialize.
*   **XYST:** No right to specific performance as no perfected contract existed.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Absence of Absolute Acceptance:** The core issue is that XYST's acceptance of DMC's initial offer was not absolute; it included amendments, constituting a counter-offer under Article 1319 of the Civil Code. This is a key risk, as a qualified acceptance effectively rejects the original offer.
*   **Negotiation Stage vs. Perfection:** The Court found that the parties remained in the negotiation stage, as further details were still under discussion, and the element of consent had not been met, per *Gateway Electronics Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines*, G.R. Nos. 155217 and 156393, July 30, 2003.
*   **Characterization of Reservation Fee:** XYST argued the reservation fee was earnest money. The Court rejected this, stating that earnest money applies only to perfected sales. This classification is crucial, as earnest money implies a binding contract.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1315 of the Civil Code:**  Contract perfection by mere consent.
*   **Article 1319 of the Civil Code:**  Defines consent and a qualified acceptance as a counter-offer.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:**  Governs attorney's fees, which were improperly awarded by the RTC in this case.
*   **Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. v. Asset Builders Corporation, G.R. No. 147410, February 5, 2004:**  Illustrates contract perfection requirements.
*   **Gateway Electronics Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines, G.R. Nos. 155217 and 156393, July 30, 2003:**  Defines the stages of a contract (negotiation, perfection, consummation).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in whether XYST's conditions/amendments constituted a mere clarification or a substantive counter-offer. The Court determined it was a counter-offer, preventing contract perfection.
*   The intention and legal effect of the reservation fee was also contentious.

**Conclusion:**

The Court correctly ruled that no perfected contract existed between XYST and DMC. XYST's introduction of amendments to the pro-forma contract amounted to a counter-offer, which DMC did not accept. The absence of absolute consent negated the formation of a binding contract, precluding XYST's claim for specific performance. The court cited *Salonga v. Farrales, No. L-47088, July 10, 1981* in highlighting that acceptance must be absolute in order to be valid. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of absolute and unqualified acceptance in contract formation, as stipulated by Article 1319 of the Civil Code.
