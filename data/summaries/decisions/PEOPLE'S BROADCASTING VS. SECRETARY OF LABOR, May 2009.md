Okay, here is a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People's Broadcasting (Bombo Radyo Phils., Inc.) v. The Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, et al.*, G.R. No. 179652, May 8, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the DOLE Secretary's order to pay monetary claims to a complainant, Jandeleon Juezan.

**Facts:**

*   Juezan filed a complaint with DOLE Region VII against Bombo Radyo for labor standards violations.
*   Bombo Radyo denied an employer-employee relationship, asserting Juezan was a drama talent paid per "participation basis."
*   The DOLE Regional Director found an employer-employee relationship and ordered Bombo Radyo to pay P203,726.30.
*   Bombo Radyo appealed to the DOLE Secretary, who dismissed it for failure to post a proper cash or surety bond.
*   Bombo Radyo filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals, which the CA denied, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the DOLE.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA and DOLE orders and dismissing Juezan's complaint.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

1.  **Jurisdiction (Article 128(b) of the Labor Code, as amended by R.A. 7730):** The core issue is whether the DOLE Secretary has the power to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship when the employer contests it from the outset. The Court held that while the DOLE has visitorial and enforcement powers under Article 128(b), this power is contingent on an existing (or pre-existing) employer-employee relationship. *Preliminary determination by DOLE is allowed, but cannot be coextensive with visitorial powers.* This preliminary determination is subject to review and requires at least a prima facie showing that no employer-employee relationship exist. When employer can show prima facie evidence of no such relationship, the case must be referred to NLRC.

    *   **Critical Interpretation of "in cases where the relationship of employer-employee still exists":**  The Court interpreted this clause to mean the relationship *must have existed before the controversy arose.* The DOLE's power is *not* applicable where the relationship has ceased *or* never existed.
    *   **Distinction from *Bay Haven, Inc. v. Abuan*:** The Court distinguished this case from *Bay Haven*, where an illegal dismissal claim deprived DOLE of jurisdiction under Article 217.
    *   **Implied Preclusion:** The Court finds that allowing the Secretary to decide the relationship question would allow the office to confer jurisdiction upon itself which it cannot otherwise acquire under common law principles. The court invoked *Bunbury v. Fuller* here.

2.  **Substantial Evidence:** The Court found the Regional Director's order was not supported by substantial evidence and disregarded evidence on record. The court said while documents may be a primary source of information, it requires comprehensive and intensive scrutiny.

    *   **Lack of Credibility Accorded to Employer's Evidence:** The Regional Director's reliance on Juezan's self-serving claims without giving weight to Bombo Radyo's documents was deemed erroneous.
    *   **Deficiencies in Employee Evidence:** The Court found Juezan's ID and Certification as a program employee self-defeating and insufficient proof of employer-employee relationship

3.  **Appeal Bond Requirement (Article 128(b) of the Labor Code):**  The Court ruled that the Deed of Assignment of Bank Deposit submitted by Bombo Radyo *did* constitute substantial compliance with the cash or surety bond requirement.

    *   **Deed was as good as cash:** Court said it served the same purpose as a cash or surety bond, since amount was entire award and bank had full control of money.
    *   **Distinction from *Cordova v. Keysa's Boutique*:** The Court distinguished this from a mere bank certification showing a balance in a deposit account.
    *   **Relaxes rule that an appeal may be perfected "only" upon the posting of a cash bond issued by a surety bond company duly accredited by the Sec. of Labor

4.  **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Court held that certiorari was a proper remedy because the lower tribunals acted with grave abuse of discretion.

    *   **Rationale:** The DOLE and Court of Appeals failed to properly determine existence of employer-employee relationship, which falls within the jurisdiction of the NLRC.
    *   **Exceptional Circumstances:** The Court emphasized the importance of setting the demarcation line between the NLRC and DOLE.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Novelty & Broad Implications:** This case establishes a significant limitation on the DOLE's visitorial powers, potentially requiring referral to the NLRC in many cases where employer-employee relationship is disputed.
*   **Subjective Determination:** The "prima facie showing" standard for challenging employer-employee relationship before the DOLE may be subject to varying interpretations.
*   **Dissenting Opinions:** The strong dissents highlight potential instability in the legal precedent set by this case. Note that Justices Morales and Brion joined in dissenting opinions.
*   **Relaxation of Appeal Bond Requirement:** The ruling on substantial compliance with the appeal bond is particularly weak given the explicit wording of the statue and will create future ambiguity and uncertainty.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code, Article 128(b) (as amended by R.A. 7730)
*   Labor Code, Article 217

**For the Lawyer:**

This case provides a strong argument for challenging DOLE jurisdiction in labor standards cases where the employer can present credible evidence disputing the existence of an employer-employee relationship from the outset. Focus on gathering documentary evidence to demonstrate the absence of control, supervision, and integration into the employer's business, to make the "prima facie showing" required. Be aware of the dissenting views and the potential for future litigation on this issue, especially on the appeal bond issue.
