## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ca単ada, G.R. No. 175317

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Cristino Ca単ada for rape under Article 266-A, in relation to Article 266-B paragraph 2, of R.A. 8353 ("The Anti-Rape Law").

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape as carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation, among other circumstances.
*   **Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 8353):** Sets the penalty for rape, ranging from *reclusion perpetua* to death, depending on aggravating circumstances. Specifically, it mandates a penalty from *reclusion perpetua* to death if committed with a deadly weapon. It also mandates a penalty of death when the victim is under 18, and the offender is a parent, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common law spouse of the parent of the victim.
*   **Requirement of Proof:** Prosecution must prove (1) carnal knowledge and (2) accomplishment of the act through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Use of Deadly Weapon:** The information alleged, and the prosecution proved that the crime was committed with a deadly weapon (scythe).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Cristino Ca単ada is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **State:** The State is obligated to provide due process to the accused while ensuring justice for the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Victim's Relationship to Accused:** The victim was the stepdaughter of the defendant, a fact that was not alleged in the information, preventing the imposition of the death penalty. The Supreme Court cited *People v. Alcoreza* in determining that "Relationship as a qualifying circumstance in rape must not only be alleged clearly. It must also be proved beyond reasonable doubt, just as the crime itself."
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The 6-day delay in reporting the rape could have been a point of contention. The Court relied on *People v. Coloma,* *People v. Santos,* and *People v. Dimaano* in determining that the delay in reporting the crime by the victim was justified due to fear.
*   **Defense Argument of Improbability:** The defense argued that the small and dirty comfort room was an improbable place for rape, the court cited *People v. Watimar* in arguing that lust is no respecter of time and place.
