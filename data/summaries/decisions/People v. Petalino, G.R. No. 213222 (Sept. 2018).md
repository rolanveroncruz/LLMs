**Case Summary: *People v. Petalino*, G.R. No. 213222 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for Murder. The Supreme Court (SC) modified the CA decision, convicting the accused of Homicide instead.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Identification:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' reliance on the positive identification of the accused by an eyewitness (Franklin Bariquit). Denial and alibi were insufficient to overcome this positive identification.
*   **Treachery:** The SC reversed the finding of treachery.
    *   **Insufficient Allegation:** The Information's allegation of treachery was deemed insufficient. The Information only stated the act of stabbing and did not detail how the attack was executed to ensure the victim's inability to defend himself, as required by *People v. Valdez*, G.R. No. 175602 (2012). A mere statement that treachery was attendant is a conclusion of law, not a factual averment.
    *   **Lack of Deliberation:** The evidence did not show that the accused consciously adopted a mode of attack to ensure the killing without risk to himself. The meeting was casual and the attack impulsive. See *People v. Ramelo*, G.R. No. 224888 (2017).
*   **Crime and Penalty:** Absent treachery, the SC convicted the accused of Homicide (Article 249, Revised Penal Code) and imposed an indeterminate sentence of nine years of *prision mayor* to 14 years, eight months and one day of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Civil Liability:**  The SC, citing *People v. Jugueta*, G.R. No. 202124 (2016), awarded the heirs of the victim P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P50,000 as temperate damages, plus legal interest of 6% per annum from finality until fully paid.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Accused: Indeterminate sentence for Homicide. Financial liabilities for civil indemnity, moral damages, and temperate damages, plus interest and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Information Sufficiency:** The SC emphasized the necessity for detailed factual averments of qualifying circumstances like treachery in the Information.  Failure to plead these elements may prevent conviction for the qualified offense even if proven.
*   **Treachery Definition:** The case reinforces the high evidentiary bar for establishing treachery. The prosecution must prove both the defenselessness of the victim AND the deliberate adoption of a method to ensure the killing without risk to the perpetrator. Suddenness of the attack is insufficient, the impulsivity of the act negates its inclusion.

**Relevant Law/Statutes:**

*   Article 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Article 249, Revised Penal Code (Homicide)
*   Article 14, paragraph 16, Revised Penal Code (Treachery)
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law
