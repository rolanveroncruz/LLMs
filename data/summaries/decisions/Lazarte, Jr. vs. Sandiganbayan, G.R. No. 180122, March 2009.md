## Legal Document Summary - *Lazarte v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 180122)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari assailing Sandiganbayan Resolutions denying a Motion to Quash an Information.

**Facts:** Felicisimo Lazarte, Jr. (Petitioner), as manager of the Regional Projects Department (RPD) and Chairman of the Inventory and Acceptance Committee (IAC) of the National Housing Authority (NHA), was charged with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) before the Sandiganbayan. The charge stemmed from alleged overpayment to A.C. Cruz Construction for infrastructure work on the Pahanocoy Sites and Services Project due to ghost activities (excavation and road filling) and substandard workmanship.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019:** The Information alleges that Lazarte, along with other NHA officials and the contractor, Arceo C. Cruz, conspired with manifest partiality and evident bad faith to cause payment of P232,628.35 to A.C. Cruz Construction for work that was not performed.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Information alleges conspiracy among the accused, without detailing the specific acts of each.
*   **Lack of Damage/Injury:** Petitioner argues that no damage or injury was caused to the government.
*   **Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan:** The Sandiganbayan asserts jurisdiction based on Lazarte's position as a Department Manager of a government-owned or controlled corporation (GOCC), regardless of his salary grade.
*   **Motion to Quash:** Lazarte filed a Motion to Quash the Information based on the grounds that the facts do not constitute an offense, the information does not conform to the prescribed form, his constitutional rights were violated because of inadequacy of the information, and the prosecution failed to determine the individual participation of each accused.

**Obligations:**

*   Lazarte, as a public officer (RPD manager and IAC Chairman), had a duty to ensure the proper disbursement of public funds and the accurate assessment of work performed.

**Liabilities:**

*   If found guilty, Lazarte faces potential criminal liability under Section 3(e) of RA 3019.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Conviction:** If convicted, Lazarte may face imprisonment and other penalties.
*   **Forfeiture of Assets:** Related to potential civil forfeiture if the overpayment is deemed ill-gotten wealth.
*   **Damage to Reputation:** Accusation and trial can damage Lazarte's reputation even if acquitted.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Quitlong (354 Phil. 372 (1998)):**  Discusses how conspiracy as a mode of committing an offense should be alleged in the Information.

*   **Lacson v. Executive Secretary, et al.:** Further details the elements for an offense to fall under Sandiganbayan jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy Allegation:** The generality of the conspiracy allegation in the Information is a key point of contention. Petitioner argues that the individual participation of each accused must be specified, while the prosecution argues that it is sufficient to allege the conspiracy.
*   **Jurisdiction:** The Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction is challenged based on the salary grade of the accused, which could potentially put him outside its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court, however, used jurisprudence to confirm jurisdiction.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Sandiganbayan's denial of the Motion to Quash.  The Court found the Information sufficient to allege the essential elements of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.  The Court ruled that the Information, read as a whole, adequately informed Lazarte of the charges against him and the nature of the alleged conspiracy.
