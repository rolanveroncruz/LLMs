Okay, here's a legal summary of *People v. Bautista*, 352 Phil. 665 (1998), formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alfonso Bautista*, G.R. Nos. 120898-99, May 14, 1998.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division (Regalado, J.)

**Summary:**

This case is an appeal of two Regional Trial Court (RTC) convictions: (1) illegal possession of firearm and ammunition (Crim. Case No. U-8191) and (2) murder with frustrated and attempted murder (Crim. Case No. U-8192) stemming from a shooting on May 18, 1992. The Supreme Court *reversed* the RTC's decision, acquitting Alfonso Bautista due to reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Bautista was charged with and convicted by the RTC of:
    *   Illegal possession of a firearm used in the shooting of Eduardo Datario, Bernabe Bayona, and Cinderella Estrella.
    *   Murder of Eduardo Datario (who died from his wounds) and frustrated/attempted murder of Bayona and Estrella.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution's case relied heavily on the testimonies of two alleged eyewitnesses, Ferdinand Datario (brother of the deceased) and Rolando Nagsagaray, who claimed to have seen Bautista shoot the victims.
*   **Defense's Case:** Bautista denied involvement, claiming he didn't know the victims. A neighbor testified he was at a birthday party at the time of the incident. He claimed he was tortured into admitting to the crime upon arrest.
*   **Delayed Identification:** Key to the SC's reversal was the fact that the eyewitnesses only identified Bautista as the shooter *sixteen months* after the incident, after Bautista's arrest on another matter.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The RTC found Bautista liable for murder, frustrated murder, attempted murder, and illegal possession of a firearm. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for illegal possession and *reclusion perpetua* for the murder charge, plus civil indemnity and damages.
*   The Supreme Court determined the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proving Bautista's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The primary contentious issue was the credibility of the prosecution's eyewitnesses. The SC found their delayed reporting of Bautista's alleged involvement highly suspect, particularly given their failure to report to authorities (mayor, police, *barangay* officials) sooner, or anonymously. The delay was deemed "unreasonable" and not justified by claimed fear, especially since arrest already happened.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The SC highlighted material inconsistencies and improbabilities in the eyewitness accounts. These included timing issues and a lack of plausible explanation as to how their claimed observations could have been made, given the layout of the scene. The Court noted contradictions between Datario and his father regarding when the identification was made.
*   **Lack of Motive:** The prosecution failed to establish any motive for Bautista to commit the crime.
*   **Absence of Firearm:** Notably, the prosecution did not present the firearm allegedly used in the shooting as evidence.
*   **Alibi vs. Lack of Recollection:** The Court noted the prosecution dismissed Bautista's "alibi", but then discussed it was not an alibi since he was unable to recall what he was doing at the time of the crime.
*   **Res Inter Alios Acta:** The Court noted the introduction of evidence from the Philippine National Police harped on the fact that after his arrest for another alleged crime, herein appellant was linked to a number of long unsolved killings in the region, and how it went against res inter alios acta.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   The Court cited *People v. Cunanan*, 19 SCRA 769 (1967), *People v. Cruz*, 129 SCRA 156 (1984), and *People v. Gonzales*, 183 SCRA 309 (1996) regarding the negative impact of unexplained delays in reporting a crime.
*   The Court implicitly relied on the constitutional principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   The Court cited Section 34, Rule 130 on res inter alios acta.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main ambiguity revolves around the reasons for the eyewitnesses' delay in reporting the crime. The SC did not find their explanation of fear credible. The fact that they only came forward after Bautista was arrested and allegedly confessed cast significant doubt on their truthfulness.

**Legal Significance**

This case highlights the importance of timely reporting of crimes and the scrutiny that delayed identification testimony will receive. It also underscores the need for the prosecution to prove both *corpus delicti* and the identity of the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt, which was not satisfied due to unreliable identification, and the impact that inconsistencies and lack of motive will have on the prosecution's burden.
