Okay, here's a concise summary of the legal document provided, formatted for a lawyer's review:

**Case:** *Extra Excel International Philippines, Inc. v. Hon. Afable E. Cajigal* (A.M. No. RTJ-18-2523)

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Cajigal for gross ignorance of the law, gross inefficiency, grave abuse of authority, and evident partiality related to Criminal Case No. R-QZN-13-00488-CR (Qualified Theft).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Granting Motion for Preliminary Investigation:** Judge Cajigal granted the accused's Motion for Preliminary Investigation after the Information was filed, violating A.M. No. 11-6-10-SC (rules on arraignment upon lapse of 60-day period for reinvestigation).  *Note:* While CA found Grave Abuse of Discretion for this, the Supreme Court did not find it to be *gross* ignorance of the law due to lack of bad faith/malice.
*   **Failure to Issue Hold Departure Order:**  Judge Cajigal failed to resolve Complainant's Motion for Issuance of Hold Departure Order for over 90 days.
*   **Allowing Accused to Go Home After Arraignment (Non-Bailable Offense):**  Judge Cajigal allowed the accused to go home after arraignment without being in custody of the law or on bail. This is contrary to established jurisprudence that the accused must either be in the custody of the law or out on bail upon arraignment. Judge also failed to conduct a personal evaluation of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the indictment, pursuant to Section 5, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court and Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution. Leviste v. Hon. Alameda dictates that a judge is duty-bound to personally evaluate the resolution of the public prosecutor and the supporting evidence with or without motion.
*   **Granting Bail Without Hearing:**  Judge Cajigal granted the accused's Petition for Bail without conducting a proper hearing to determine the strength of evidence, even though the prosecution did not object. *Balanay v. Judge White* established that a bail hearing is necessary even if the prosecution does not interpose any objection or leaves the application for bail to the sound discretion of the court.
*   **Alleged Bias/Partiality:** Complainant argued that Judge Cajigal demonstrated bias by failing to inhibit himself and by rescheduling redirect examination to expedite proceedings before retirement.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Actions were performed in his judicial capacity and allegations are malicious.
*   Delayed resolving Hold Departure Order due to pending omnibus motion.
*   Accused was not detained because there was no warrant yet and bail petition was filed.
*   Public prosecutor did not object to bail.
*   Rescheduled examination for speedy trial.

**OCA Report/Recommendation:**

*   Found Judge Cajigal liable for inefficiency (delay in resolving Hold Departure Order) and gross ignorance of the law (granting bail without hearing).
*   Recommended a fine, citing Section 50, Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Substantially adopted OCA findings, but *also* found Judge liable for gross ignorance of the law and procedure in allowing the accused to go home after arraignment *without being in custody of the law or on bail*
*   Noted Judge had been previously admonished. *Dulalia v. Judge Cajigal* for undue delay in resolving motions.
*   Found Judge guilty of gross ignorance of the law and procedure and gross inefficiency
*   Imposed a FINE of P20,000.00 to be deducted from his retirement benefits.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Good Faith" vs. "Gross Ignorance":** The line between error in judgment and gross ignorance is blurred. The Court emphasizes that the *absence* of malice/bad faith mitigates some claims.
*   **Retirement:** The impending retirement of Judge Cajigal influenced the court's decision to impose a fine instead of a harsher penalty.
*   **Subjectivity of Bias:**  Establishing actual bias is difficult, and the Court gives considerable weight to the presumption of good faith in judicial actions.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *A.M. No. 11-6-10-SC*: Rules on arraignment.
*   *Leviste v. Hon. Alameda*: Duty of judge to evaluate prosecutor's resolution of probable cause.
*   *Balanay v. Judge White*: Necessity of bail hearing.
* *Miranda v. Tuliao*: Custody of the law is accomplished either by arrest or voluntary surrender.
