**Legal Document Summary: *Equitable PCI Banking Corporation vs. RCBC Capital Corporation***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging RTC Orders that confirmed a Partial Award rendered by the International Chamber of Commerce-International Court of Arbitration (ICC-ICA).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Share Purchase Agreement (SPA):** Governs the purchase by RCBC of EPCIB's shares in Bankard. Contains representations and warranties, including financial condition representations in Section 5 (g) and (h).
*   **Section 5(g):** Sellers warrant the fairness, accuracy, and completeness of Bankard's audited and unaudited financial statements (1997-1999, and Q1 2000) prepared according to GAAP.
*   **Section 5(h):** Sellers warrant that Bankard has no undisclosed liabilities, omissions, or mistakes exceeding PhP 100 million that would materially adversely affect its net worth as of Dec 31, 1999 and March 31 2000. Provides a formula for purchase price reduction if the threshold is met.
*   **Section 7 (Remedies):** If warranties are untrue, non-defaulting party can require the defaulting party to cure the breach and/or seek damages. Time limit: 3 years from closing date, EXCEPT for breaches of Section 5(h), which have a 6-month limit.
*   **Amendment to Share Purchase Agreement (ASPA):** Extends the deadline for claims under Section 5(h) to December 31, 2000.
*   **Arbitration Clause (Section 10):** Mandates ICC-ICA arbitration for disputes.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Sellers (EPCIB, et al.):** Liable for breaches of warranties under Sections 5(g) and 5(h).  Damages for 5(g) breaches, price reduction for 5(h) (if conditions met).
*   **Buyer (RCBC):** Obligated to follow the terms of the SPA, including time limits for making claims.

**ICC-ICA Partial Award:**

*   Ruled RCBC's claim *not* time-barred, falling under Section 5(g) (3-year limit), not 5(h) (6-month limit).
*   Found EPCIB breached Section 5(g) due to overstated assets, revenue, and net worth.
*   Awarded damages to RCBC, subject to proof of loss.
*   Denied rescission of the SPA.
*   **Dissent (Justice Kapunan):** Argued claim was actually under Section 5(h) and thus time-barred, also asserted RCBC was estopped.

**Issues on Appeal:**

1.  **Prescription:** Was RCBC's claim time-barred? Did the ICC-ICA improperly apply the 3-year (5g) versus 6-month (5h) limitations? Is the claim for 'overpayment' properly under 5h not 5g?
2.  **Due Process:** Was EPCIB denied due process because the arbitration panel admitted summaries of data without requiring RCBC to produce the source documents? Were petitioners denied the right to cross-examine witnesses?
3.  **Estoppel:** Did RCBC's knowledge of Bankard's accounting practices, conduct of limited audit, and payment of the balance of the purchase price estop it from claiming breach of warranty? Did RCBC take too long to point out any irregularities in accounting?

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. (RA) 9285 (Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004):** Governs appeals of arbitral awards. Sec. 46 specifies appeal to the CA.
*   **Republic Act No. 876 (Arbitration Law):** Specifies procedures for arbitration. Sec 15 covers hearing by arbitrators
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1370 (clear contract terms), Art. 1431 (estoppel).

**Case Law References:**

*   *Korea Technologies Co., Ltd v. Lerma:* Proper appellate procedure for arbitral awards under RA 9285.
*   *Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals:* Establishes parameters for setting aside an arbitral award.
*   *Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Jaros:* Defines "manifest disregard of the law."
*   *Compania Maritima v. Allied Free Worker's Union:* Cited by petitioners but distinguished.
*   *Philippine Savings Bank v. Chowking Food Corporation:* Principle of estoppel, including element of reliance.
*   *Knecht v. Court of Appeals* and *Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:* Distinguished by the court as not analogous to the present case re: estoppel.
*   *CMP Federal Security Agency, Inc. v. NLRC* & *Quiambao v. Court of Appeals:* Due process in administrative proceedings doesn't require court procedures.
*   *Velez v. De Vera:* Right to cross-examine not indispensable aspect of due process in administrative law.
*   *People v. Escote, Jr.:* Right to cross-examine can be waived.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in SPA regarding overlap between Sec. 5(g) and Sec. 5(h):** The central dispute revolves around whether the specific provisions of Section 5(h) exclude the claim from the broader warranty of Section 5(g). The dissenting arbitrator saw the claim as clearly under 5(h), suggesting room for interpretation. The Court ruled that RCBC could exercise either remedy and non-use of one section did not preclude RCBC from using the other.
*   **"Manifest Disregard of the Law" Standard:** Difficult to prove. Courts defer to arbitrators' decisions unless a clear violation of established legal precedent is shown.
*   **Enforcement Risks:** Although the RTC confirmed the award, the initial misstep of appealing directly to the SC could have jeopardized the case procedurally. This was rejected by the SC as the outcome would be the same.
*   **Estoppel Argument Weak:** Petitioners failed to establish that RCBC's actions misled them to their detriment.
* **RCBC Continuing with the same accounting is practice** The court stated that this was likely because RCBC needed to review Bankard's volume of data, to see any irregularities in the transactions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the petition and affirmed the RTC orders confirming the arbitral award. The Court held that RCBC's claim was not time-barred, EPCIB was not denied due process, and RCBC was not estopped. The Court found the ICC-ICA's findings to be legally sound and factually supported.
