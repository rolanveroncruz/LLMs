**Case Summary: *Haveria v. SSS*** (G.R. No. 181154, August 22, 2018)

**Facts:**
Petitioner Haveria, a former SSS employee, sought to reinstate suspended retirement benefits. He claimed SSS membership based on purported employment with the SSS Employeesâ€™ Association (SSSEA) where he was an officer. SSS suspended benefits, arguing no employer-employee relationship existed between Haveria and SSSEA. The SSS argued that because the SSSEA is a labor organization, it could not be considered an employer and therefore was not eligible for SSS coverage. The SSS also argued that the four-fold test did not apply to the case.

**Issue:**
Was Haveria's inclusion as a compulsory SSS member valid, entitling him to retirement benefits?

**Ruling:**
No. The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision, which upheld the Social Security Commission's (SSC) ruling. Haveria's coverage based on employment with the SSSEA was deemed erroneous. The Court noted that the Labor Code (Art. 219) excludes labor organizations from the definition of "employer" unless acting directly as an employer.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Compulsory vs. Voluntary SSS Coverage (R.A. No. 1161, Sec. 9):**  Distinguishes between employees whose employers are mandated to register with SSS and those who voluntarily join. The Court emphasized the distinction in determining eligibility for benefits and the specific eligibility requirements of both categories.
*   **Definition of Employer (R.A. No. 1161, Sec. 8(c); Labor Code Art. 219(e)):** The SSSEA, as a labor organization, does not qualify as an employer under the law.
*   **Four-fold test**: Selection of employee, payment of wages, power of dismissal, power to control employee's conduct.

**Liabilities & Remedies:**

*   **Erroneous Registration:** Haveria's compulsory coverage based on the false pretense of being an employee of SSSEA was invalid.
*   **Offsetting of Overpayments:** The SSS is authorized to recompute benefits and offset previously paid pensions against future entitlements.
*   **Crediting as Voluntary Contributions:** The Court, in equity, ordered the SSS to credit SSSEA-remitted contributions towards the 120-month minimum for pension eligibility, treating them as voluntary contributions from April 1997 onwards.
*   **Refund of Excess Contributions:** Remaining contributions beyond the 120-month requirement are to be refunded, subject to the offsetting of the pensions previously paid to Haveria that he was not entitled to.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Estoppel Argument:** Haveria's argument that the SSS is estopped from denying his membership due to past acceptance of contributions was rejected.  The Court cited *Noda v. SSS* (195 Phil. 769 (1981)), holding that estoppel does not apply against the government or its agencies when based on mistaken representations.
*   **Four-fold Test Analysis:** The case potentially opens up areas for contentious litigation about how the requirements are met.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 1161 (Social Security Act of 1954):**  Governs SSS coverage at the time of Haveria's initial registration. Sec 9 discussed both voluntary and involuntary coverage of employees. Sec. 8 defines who is an employer.
*   **R.A. No. 8282 (Social Security Act of 1997):** Amendments to the SSS law relevant to membership and eligibility.
*   **Labor Code Article 219:** Defines the definition of "Employer."
*   **Atok Big Wedge Company, Inc. v. Gison, 670 Phil. 615, 626-627 (2011):** Defines and explains the four-fold test of employment.
*   **Noda v. SSS, 195 Phil. 769 (1981):** Estoppel does not apply against a government agency when the party claiming estoppel has misled the agency into doing so.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity surrounding the "control test" within the 4-fold test opens area for litigation.
*   The Court's directive to credit SSSEA contributions as "voluntary" *ex post facto* might raise procedural concerns if Haveria did not explicitly elect such coverage.

**For a lawyer, this case underscores:**

*   The importance of verifying the legitimacy of employer-employee relationships for SSS coverage.
*   The limitations on invoking estoppel against government agencies, particularly when based on misleading information.
*   The Court's willingness to apply equity in social security cases, but only within defined legal parameters and subject to statutory requirements (e.g., minimum contribution periods).
