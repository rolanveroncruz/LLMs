Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Domingo Sta. Ana y Tupig*, G.R. Nos. 115657-59, June 26, 1998 (353 Phil. 388).

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Accused-Appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of rape.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Accused-Appellant (Sta. Ana) was charged with three counts of rape against Judilyn Obera, a minor, on November 28, 1991, February 17, 1992, and April 22, 1992. The Informations alleged lewd design, threats, and intimidation.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC convicted Sta. Ana and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua* for each count, and ordered him to pay the victim P50,000.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimony of the victim, who detailed the alleged rapes, emphasizing the use of a knife and threats by the accused. Judilyn disclosed the rapes after her pregnancy was discovered.
*   **Defense's Version:** Sta. Ana denied the charges, asserting alibi and claiming he was forced by police to admit the crime without legal counsel. He presented alibi witnesses and his daughter, who was a friend of the victim.
*   **Trial Court Credibility Assessment:** The RTC gave significant weight to the victim's testimony, finding it clear, credible, and straightforward. It rejected the defense of alibi.

**Issues on Appeal:**

1.  Whether the complainant’s conduct before and after the alleged sexual assaults belies the accusation of rape.
2.  Whether the alleged dates of the rape coincide with the age of the fetus.
3.  Whether the complainant had a motive to falsely accuse the accused.
4.  Whether the complainant's credibility is lacking, especially in her identification of the accused.

**Court's Ruling & Analysis:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's assessment of the victim's credibility, emphasizing the deference given to trial courts in assessing witness demeanor. It cited established jurisprudence on the scrutiny required in rape cases but found the victim's testimony to be convincing.
*   **Complainant's Conduct (Prior and After):** The court rejected the argument that the victim's continued association with the accused and his family was inconsistent with rape, citing *People v. Montefalcon* and *People v. Remoto*, which recognized varying reactions to trauma and the impact of threats on victims' behavior. The court deemed the threats a valid reason for the victim's delay in reporting.
*   **Pregnancy and Dates of Rape:** The Court rejected the defense's argument regarding the alleged discrepancy between the medical findings of the fetal age and the dates of the alleged rapes. It emphasized that pregnancy is *not* an element of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. The critical element is lack of consent, which, in this case, was absent either through force/intimidation or due to the victim's minority. *People v. Adora* was cited to show that the exact date of fertilization is problematic.
*   **Improper Motive:** The Court rejected the argument that the victim fabricated the charge to salvage her reputation. It emphasized the stigma faced by rape victims and found no evidence of ill motive on Judilyn's part. The Court cited *People vs. Madaraog* and *People vs. Hortelana*.
*   **Alibi:**  The Court rejected the alibi defense, noting the proximity of the accused's alleged location to the crime scene, negating impossibility. The court cited *People vs. Cañada* that alibi is weak when the accused was positively identified by the victim.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (definition of rape and penalties).

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Cañada*, 253 SCRA 277 (1996) - Defense of alibi must fail where the accused was positively identified by the victim herself.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case revolves around credibility assessment, which is inherently subjective. The weight given to the victim's testimony, despite some inconsistencies, is critical.
*   The medical evidence regarding the timing of the pregnancy was challenged, however the court held that it was immaterial.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   Accused-Appellant is liable for three counts of rape, each carrying a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   He is liable for civil indemnity, increased to a total of P150,000.00 (P50,000.00 per count).

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court *denied* the appeal and *affirmed* the RTC's decision with the *modification* to increase the civil indemnity.
