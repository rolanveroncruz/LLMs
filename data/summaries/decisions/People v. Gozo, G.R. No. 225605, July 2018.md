**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Venerando Gozo y Velasquez*, G.R. No. 225605, July 23, 2018.

**Summary:** This case involves an appeal of a conviction for statutory rape under Philippine law. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the designation of the crime from statutory rape to simple rape due to a failure of the prosecution to prove the victim's age with sufficient evidence.

**Key Provisions & Elements:**

*   **Charge:** Initially charged with statutory rape under the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Elements of Statutory Rape:** Requires proof of the victim's age (under 12), identity of the accused, and sexual intercourse. *See People v. Cadano, Jr., 729 Phil. 576 (2014)*.
*   **Age Determination:** Prosecution failed to provide a birth certificate or other sufficient evidence to prove victim's age. The court cites *People v. Pruna, 439 Phil. 440 (2002)* regarding the hierarchy of acceptable evidence for proving a victim's age. Testimony regarding age was also hearsay.
*   **Elements of Rape:** Force, threat, or intimidation are elements of rape. The court stated even absent any actual force or intimidation, rape can be committed if the malefactor has moral ascendancy over the victim

**Obligations:**

*   Prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of statutory rape *beyond a reasonable doubt*, including the victim's age.
*   Accused is obligated to comply with the court's sentence, including imprisonment and payment of damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the accused was liable for statutory rape but was modified to simple rape.

*   The court ordered the defendant to pay the victim civil indemnity (₱75,000.00), moral damages (₱75,000.00), and exemplary damages (₱75,000.00).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Age Determination & *Pruna* Case Law:** The prosecution's failure to properly establish the victim's age via admissible evidence as outlined in *Pruna* led to the downgrading of the offense.

*   **Parole Eligibility:** The Court of Appeals incorrectly stated that the accused was ineligible for parole. This was unnecessary since reclusion perpetua is an indivisible penalty, making parole ineligibility automatic. *See A.M No. 15-08-02-SC*

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Governs the crimes of rape and statutory rape.
*   **Rules of Evidence, Section 40, Rule 130:** Regarding testimony on pedigree (family history).
*   **People v. Pruna, 439 Phil. 440 (2002):** Establishes guidelines for proving a minor's age in statutory rape cases.

*   **People v. Hilarion, 722 Phil. 52 (2013):** Similar case where statutory rape was downgraded to simple rape due to insufficient proof of age.
*   **A.M No. 15-08-02-SC:** Guidelines on use of "without eligibility for parole."
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 849 (2016):** Sets the amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
