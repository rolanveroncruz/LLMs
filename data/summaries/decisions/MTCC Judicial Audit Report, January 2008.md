**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning judicial audit results in MTCC, Branch 1, Cebu City.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Judge Mamerto Y. Coliflores (Retired):** Found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law and grave misconduct due to:
    *   Imposing a penalty beyond the jurisdiction of his court (Crim. Case No. 118324-R), violating Section 32(2) of BP 129.
    *   Promulgating two conflicting decisions on the same day in Crim. Case No. 117409-R.
    *   Deciding Crim. Case No. 108731-R without records or scheduled hearing.
    *   Taking cognizance of petitions (bail, rehabilitation) without proper raffle violating Circular No. 7 and exceeding jurisdiction under RA 6425 and RA 9165 (Dangerous Drugs Acts).
*   **Judge Anastacio S. Necesario:** Found GUILTY of violating a Supreme Court rule by taking cognizance of cases lacking proper referral from Branch 1, specifically concerning drug dependents.
*   **Mr. Jose A. Legazpi (Branch Clerk of Court):** Found GUILTY of grave misconduct due to:
    *   Willful disregard of Circular No. 7 by receiving and docketing cases without raffle and exercising judicial functions (e.g., drafting orders for drug rehabilitation).
    *   Preparing and subscribing a counter-affidavit for an accused in cases pending in his branch.
    *   Failure to present records to the judicial audit team.
*   **Ms. Romnie Fernan-Rota & Mr. Roldan A. Artes:** Reprimanded for their role in receiving cases directly, violating Circular No. 7.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges must adhere to jurisdictional limitations and proper procedures.
*   Court personnel must follow established rules, including the raffle of cases, and refrain from exceeding their ministerial duties or engaging in acts creating bias.
*   All judiciary members bear responsibility for proper conduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Coliflores:** Fine of P40,000.00 deducted from retirement benefits.  His past offenses are considered, including: *Harayo v. Coliflores*, *Tudtud v. Coliflores*, *Tugot v. Coliflores*, *Betoy, Sr. v. Coliflores*.
*   **Judge Necesario:** Fine of P20,000.00 with a warning.
*   **Mr. Legazpi:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of benefits (excluding leave credits) and prejudice to re-employment. Also had a prior penalty of a fine equivalent to 3 months salary in *Tan v. Coliflores*.
*   **Ms. Fernan-Rota & Mr. Artes:** Reprimand and warning.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The case highlights the risks of judicial officers exceeding their authority and court personnel failing to adhere to established procedures, including the potential for biased adjudication of cases when circumventing Circular 7's lottery system of case assignments.
*   While Legazpi confessed to penning the questioned orders Judge Necessario signed, Necessario cannot claim he was unaware of any judicial irregularities when it should be his responsibility to be well aware of them. He is in violation of Section 1, Rule 36, which judges are mandated to prepare judgement that determine the merits of the case as well as the facts and laws that the decision is based on.
