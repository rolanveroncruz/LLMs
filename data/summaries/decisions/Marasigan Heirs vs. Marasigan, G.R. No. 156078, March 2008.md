**Case Summary: *Heirs of Cesar Marasigan v. Apolonio Marasigan*, G.R. No. 156078, March 14, 2008**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's order regarding the partition of the estate of Alicia Marasigan. The core issue revolves around the propriety of the RTC's decision to approve the Commissioners' Report recommending the assignment of Alicia Marasigan's pro-indiviso share in Hacienda Sta. Rita to one of the heirs instead of physical partition.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Action for Partition:** The case involves a judicial partition under Rule 69 of the Rules of Court.
2.  **Pro-Indiviso Ownership:** The estate consists of an undivided 2/21 share in a larger property (Hacienda Sta. Rita), complicating physical partition. The share represents 422,422.65 sq. meters.
3.  **Commissioners' Report (Sec. 5, Rule 69):** The Commissioners concluded that physical division was impractical and prejudicial to the interests of the parties due to the land's scattered location, varying conditions, and the pro-indiviso nature of the ownership. They recommended assigning the property to one heir willing to compensate the others.
4.  **Due Process (Notice Requirement - Sec. 4, Rule 69):** Petitioners allege a lack of notice regarding the Commissioners' viewing and examination of the property, arguing a violation of their due process rights and invalidating the Commissioners' recommendation.
5.  **Substantive Rights vs. Procedural Rules (Art. 494, 495, 498 NCC):** Petitioners argued that the Court of Appeals' interpretation of "prejudice" to include impracticality violates the constitutional limitation on the rule-making power of the Supreme Court. They allege the interpretation modifies the substantive rights of co-owners under the Civil Code to demand partition.
6. **Public Auction and Subsequent Appeal**: Petitioner question the validity of the public auction sale of their shares and claim deficiency in the price paid for their shares.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Heirs of Cesar Marasigan (Petitioners):** Obligation to prove the prejudice caused by the lack of notice during the Commissioners' inspection. They bear the burden of demonstrating that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Apolonio Marasigan et al. (Respondents):** Initially, had the burden to demonstrate that partition was proper. After RTC ruling, the burden fell on the Petitioners to dispute the findings of the RTC.
*   **RTC:** Duty to ensure a fair and equitable partition process.
*   **Commissioners:** Duty to conduct a fair and impartial assessment and recommendation for partition.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Prejudice" Interpretation (Sec. 5, Rule 69):** The broad interpretation of "prejudice" to include impracticality is a potential point of contention. Petitioners argue that this effectively overrides their substantive right to demand partition under the Civil Code.
*   **Validity of Public Auction Sale:**  The petitioners questioned the validity of the public auction sale, raising concerns about the fairness and adequacy of the price obtained for their share. However, this issue was already decided in G.R. No. 164970.
*   **Pro-Indiviso Nature:** The inherent difficulty in partitioning a pro-indiviso interest complicates the matter and necessitates a solution that may not fully satisfy all parties.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 69, Sections 4 and 5 of the Rules of Court:** Governs actions for partition and the duties of commissioners.
*   **Articles 494, 495, 498 of the New Civil Code:** Defines the rights of co-owners to demand partition and the limitations thereof.
*   **Tijam v. Sibonghanoy:** Case on estoppel in questioning jurisdiction.
*   **National Steel Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Case on estoppel in questioning jurisdiction.
*   **Legarda v. Court of Appeals:** Case outlining the essential requirements of Due Process.
*   **Estrada v. Desierto:** Case on when constitutional issue is raised.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of "prejudice" in Section 5, Rule 69 remains a contested point, particularly its extension to encompass impracticality.
*   The valuation of the 1/7th share by the Commissioners.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the CA and upheld the RTC's decision, emphasizing that the lower court did not commit grave abuse of discretion. The Court determined the actions taken and recommendations were the most equitable resolution for all parties.
