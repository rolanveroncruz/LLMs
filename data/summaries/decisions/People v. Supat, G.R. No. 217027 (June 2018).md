## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Narciso Supat y Radoc* (G.R. No. 217027, June 6, 2018)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the conviction of Narciso Supat y Radoc for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision and acquitted the accused due to significant breaches of the mandatory procedural requirements in Section 21 of RA 9165 concerning the chain of custody of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):** Establishes the crime of selling dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) a sale transaction, (2) presentation of the corpus delicti (illicit drug), and (3) identification of buyer and seller.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Establishes the crime of possessing dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) possession of a prohibited drug, (2) lack of legal authorization for possession, and (3) free and conscious possession.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):**  This section outlines the mandatory procedures for handling and inventorying seized drugs. As the crime occurred in 2005, the original provision of Section 21, and not the amended version introduced by RA 10640, applies. Key requirements include:
    *   **Immediate inventory and photography:** Must occur "immediately after seizure and confiscation."
    *   **Presence of mandatory witnesses:** Accused (or representative/counsel), a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official. All witnesses must sign the inventory and receive a copy.
    *   **Location of inventory:** At the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station; or nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures;
    *   **Submission to PDEA Forensic Laboratory:** Within 24 hours of confiscation/seizure for examination.
* **IRR of RA 9165, Sec 21(a):** Details the location of the inventory and photography. The saving clause allows for non-compliance if justified and the integrity/evidentiary value of the seized items is preserved.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Prosecution:** Failure to strictly comply with Section 21 and establish an unbroken chain of custody can lead to acquittal due to reasonable doubt regarding the identity and integrity of the drug evidence.  The burden of proving justifiable non-compliance with Section 21 falls squarely on the prosecution.
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Failure to adhere to Section 21 and internal police procedures can expose them to administrative sanctions, criminal charges for "planting" evidence (Section 29, RA 9165), or violation of regulations issued by the Dangerous Drugs Board (Section 32, RA 9165).
*   **Accused:** While the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, a conviction can lead to life imprisonment (for illegal sale) and a substantial prison sentence (for illegal possession), as well as significant fines.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Establishes the crimes of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Mandates the chain of custody procedure.  *Crucially, the original version of Section 21, predating RA 10640, applies to this case.*
*   **RA 10640:** Amends Section 21, reducing the number of required witnesses. *This amendment is not applicable to this case.*
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Section 21(a):** Clarifies the procedures and provides a "saving clause."
*   **Relevant Jurisprudence:**
    *   ***People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):*** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of media, DOJ, and elected public official witnesses to prevent planting of evidence and maintain an unbroken chain of custody.
    *   ***People v. Gonzales, 708 Phil. 121 (2013):*** Highlights the importance of marking the seized items immediately upon seizure and the significance of prompt marking.
    *   ***People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214 (2008):***  Illustrates the inadequacy of mere stipulations regarding laboratory results and the necessity of proving how drugs were handled by forensic chemist to establish chain of custody
    *   ***Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008):*** Emphasizes the unique characteristic of narcotic substances and the stringent standard to be applied for authenticating evidence.
    *   ***People v. Catalan, 699 Phil. 603 (2012):*** Warns against the lower courts relying on the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty over the presumption of innocence favoring the accused.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **"Immediately after seizure and confiscation":** The phrase "immediately after" in Section 21 has been interpreted to mean immediately at the place of apprehension, with limited exceptions.
*   **Saving Clause Application:**  The prosecution failed to prove "justifiable grounds" for deviations from Section 21. The prosecution failed to acknowledge or explain any lapses in the conduct of the buy-bust operation. The burden of proving such justification lies with the state.
*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:** The court identified several critical gaps in the chain of custody, including: failure to mark the evidence immediately upon seizure, inconsistencies in testimony regarding the laboratory request, the absence of testimony from the forensic chemist, and a failure to account for the transfer and handling of evidence between different officers.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The SC explicitly rejected the lower courts' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, stating that the procedural lapses demonstrated affirmative evidence of irregularity.  The presumption of innocence trumps the presumption of regularity.

**Conclusion & Outcome:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Narciso Supat y Radoc. The prosecution failed to prove compliance with the mandatory chain of custody requirements of Section 21, and also failed to justify the significant deviations from the prescribed procedure. The SC reiterated that the presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, and that prosecutors must diligently prove compliance with Section 21 to ensure the integrity of drug evidence. The Court highlighted the importance of safeguarding against planting of evidence and emphasized that non-compliance with the required procedures can result in acquittal.
