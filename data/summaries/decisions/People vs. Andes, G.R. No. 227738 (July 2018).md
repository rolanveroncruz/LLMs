## Legal Document Summary: People v. Andes (G.R. No. 227738)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a conviction for rape under Article 266-A-(l)(a) in relation to Art. 266-B, par. 2, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. The accused-appellant, Jacinto Andes, was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), and this conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals (CA). The Supreme Court (SC) subsequently affirmed the CA decision with modification regarding damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Rape - Carnal knowledge of AAA through force and intimidation.
*   **Circumstances:** The information alleges force and intimidation, armed with a bladed weapon. Victim testified the act occurred in a dark room while her son was sleeping nearby, with threats of violence.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused (Andes):** To answer for the crime of rape and serve the sentence imposed. Obligation to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **State:** To prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Established for Andes due to the victim's credible testimony and the circumstances surrounding the crime.
*   **Civil Liability:** Andes is liable for damages to the victim. Specifically, P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification:** Andes contested the victim's identification based solely on voice recognition. The court ruled this was sufficient given their prior relationship and cohabitation. This hinges heavily on the credibility assessment by the trial court.
*   **Force and Intimidation:** Andes argued the lack of explicit display of the weapon during the act and victim's verbal response indicated the absence of force and intimidation. The court rejected this, citing the context of the threat, presence of her child, and darkness of the room. This may be a point for further scrutiny if habeas corpus is considered.
*   **Victim's Post-Rape Conduct:** Andes questioned the victim's initial understatement of the crime in a text message. The court dismissed this, emphasizing that rape victims react differently and that there is no established behavior immediately following rape.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The defense highlighted that the medical examination, particularly the healed lacerations, were not conclusive evidence of rape. The court correctly stated that medical evidence is not indispensable for rape convictions, and instead relied on the positive credibility of the victim's testimony. *People v. Docena* (379 Phil. 903) is cited to support this.
*   **Alibi:** The defense of alibi was dismissed due to the proximity of the accused to the crime scene and the fact that he admitted to leaving his house the same night.
*   **Damages:** Awards of damages were modified by the SC following *People v. Jugueta* (783 Phil. 806) standardizing the amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in rape cases.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A-(l)(a) in relation to Art. 266-B, par. 2:** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353:** Amendment to the Revised Penal Code, increasing penalties for rape.
*   **People v. Soronio, 281 Phil. 820 (1991):** Defines the elements of rape.
*   **People v. Alemania, 440 Phil. 297 (2002):** Credibility assessment is best assigned to the trial court which has first-hand opportunity to hear the testimonies of the witnesses and observe their demeanor, conduct, and attitude during cross-examination.
*   **People v. Docena, 379 Phil. 903 (2000):** Medical examination not indispensable for rape conviction.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Sets standard amounts for damages in criminal cases, including rape.
*   **People v. Arcillas, 692 Phil. 40 (2012):** Interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the monetary awards reckoned from the finality of this decision.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the conviction based on the victim's credible testimony, which outweighed the accused's defenses of denial and alibi. The key issue revolved around assessing the credibility of the witness testimony, the evidence presented, and the lack of conclusive medical evidence. The defense exhausted all avenues, and failed. The damages were modified to align with current jurisprudence.
