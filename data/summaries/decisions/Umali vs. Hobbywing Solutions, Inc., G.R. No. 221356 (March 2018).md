**Case Summary: *Umali v. Hobbywing Solutions, Inc.*** (G.R. No. 221356, March 14, 2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the NLRC's decision finding illegal dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Whether Umali was illegally dismissed and attained regular employee status.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the NLRC's decision. It held that Umali attained regular employment status by operation of law under Article 281 of the Labor Code because she was allowed to work beyond the 6-month probationary period.  The Court found Hobbywing's attempts to extend the probationary period invalid.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Probationary Employment (Art. 281, Labor Code):** Establishes a 6-month probationary period unless an apprenticeship agreement stipulates otherwise. Working beyond this period results in automatic regular employment.
*   **Contradictory Evidence:** The Court emphasized the conflicting dates on the employment contracts, specifically the "01.19.13" date next to Umali's signature on both the initial contract and the "Probation Extension Letter" dated January 10, 2013. This directly contradicted Hobbywing's assertion that these documents were executed at the start of Umali's employment and at the time of the alleged extension.
*   **Invalid Extension:** Hobbywing's attempt to extend the probationary period failed because:
    *   The extension occurred *after* the original probationary period had lapsed.
    *   The extension was not based on a valid performance evaluation *before* the original probation expired, and an evaluation was only produced on February 1, 2013, by which time the petitioner was already employed.
    *   The employer did not demonstrate that the extension was warranted and not simply a stratagem to preclude the worker's attainment of regular status.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Because Umali had become a regular employee, she could only be terminated for just or authorized cause, with due process. The Court found neither existed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Hobbywing Solutions, Inc. is obligated to:
    *   Reinstate Umali to her former position without loss of seniority rights.
    *   Pay full backwages, inclusive of allowances, from the date of dismissal until actual reinstatement.
    *   Pay attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total judgment award.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Dusit Hotel vs. Gatbonton:**  Probationary employees working beyond the prescribed period are considered regular employees.
*   **Mariwasa vs. Leogardo:** Discusses valid extensions of probationary periods based on mutual agreement.  Distinguished because, in this case, the extension was not validly executed, and was not done to allow the employee an opportunity to improve.
*   **Buiser vs. Leogardo:**  Extension of the probationary period requires a specific company policy or the nature of the work. Extension of the period is the exception, rather than the rule.
*   **Peak Ventures Corporation vs. Heirs of Villareal:**  Outlines remedies for illegal dismissal, including reinstatement and backwages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Actual Reinstatement:**  The monetary award continues to accrue until actual reinstatement. Difficulty in proving actual reinstatement could lead to ongoing liability for Hobbywing.
*   **Computation of Backwages:**  Disputes may arise regarding the computation of backwages, allowances, and other benefits. A detailed computation is required by the NLRC.
*   **Good faith argument:** The court did not give any weight to the good faith argument raised by the respondent (i.e., processing exit clearance, waiver of non-compete, etc.).

**Ambiguities:**

*   The ambiguity surrounded the timing of the signing of the contracts. This was the decisive factor leading the Court to reverse the CA's decision.

**Recommendations:**

Carefully scrutinize the computation of backwages and ensure compliance with the NLRC's order. Hobbywing should document attempts to reinstate Umali to mitigate ongoing liability. This case emphasizes the importance of strictly adhering to the rules on probationary employment and ensuring timely and proper performance evaluations.
