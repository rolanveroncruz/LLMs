**Legal Document Summary: *Borromeo v. Descallar*, G.R. No. 159310 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:**  Dispute over ownership of real property initially purchased during a relationship between an Austrian national (Jambrich) and a Filipina (Descallar), registered solely in Descallar's name.  The Austrian, Jambrich, subsequently sold his rights to Borromeo, a Filipino citizen, leading to a claim for recovery of real property.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Alien Land Ownership Restriction:**  The core issue revolves around the constitutional prohibition (Article XII, Section 7, 1987 Constitution; mirroring previous constitutions) against aliens acquiring private land in the Philippines, except by hereditary succession.  Descallar argued that Jambrich, as an alien, could not legally acquire the property; therefore, he had no rights to transfer to Borromeo.
*   **Financial Capacity & Factual Findings:** The RTC found that Jambrich's income during the period of acquisition was significantly greater than Descallar's, suggesting he provided the funds. This factual finding was not overturned by the CA.
*   **Registration vs. Ownership:**  The Supreme Court emphasized that registration under the Torrens system is not a mode of acquiring ownership but only confirms its existence. TCT in Descallar's name is not conclusive proof.
*   **Curing the Defect:** SC relies on *United Church Board for World Ministries v. Sebastian*, 159 SCRA 446 (1988) and subsequent cases following that legal precedent.The transfer of Jambrich's rights to Borromeo, a Filipino citizen, cured the original illegality of the alien's acquisition, validating Borromeo's title.
*   **Cohabitation:** Article 144 of the Civil Code on co-ownership does not apply. The SC held no co-ownership existed as Descallar was still married to another during her relationship with Jambrich.
*   **Deed of Assignment:** Jambrich had the authority to transfer rights in the properties through the Deed of Assignment due to his contribution toward the purchase of the properties.
*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** SC declared the contracts conveying rights and interests over the properties void insofar as they convey rights and interests to the defendant.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Descallar:** Ordered to transfer title to Borromeo, pay attorney's fees (P25,000) and litigation expenses (P10,000).
*   **Register of Deeds of Mandaue City:** Obligated to cancel Descallar's TCTs and issue new ones in Borromeo's name.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Payment:** Heavy reliance on financial capacity as a basis for determining who truly paid for the properties. Could be challenged on evidentiary grounds if Descallar could provide credible evidence of her own contributions.
*   **Good Faith:** Issue of Descallar's good faith.  SC found she acted in bad faith as she did not contribute a single centavo in the acquisition of the properties.
*   **Moral Turpitude/Adultery:** SC recognized the adulterous relationship between respondent and Jambrich.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution:** Article XII, Sections 7 and 8 (Alien Land Ownership).
*   **Civil Code:** Article 144
*   **Family Code:** Article 148
*   ***United Church Board for World Ministries v. Sebastian***, 159 SCRA 446 (1988) (Curing effect of transfer to Filipino citizen).
*   Other cases cited: *Sarsosa Vda. de Barsobia v. Cuenco*, *Godinez v. Pak Luen*, *Vasquez v. Li Seng Giap & Sons*, *Herrera v. Luy King Guan*, *Yap v. Maravillas*, *De Castro v. Tan*.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The application of the "curing" doctrine and the extent to which it completely eliminates the effects of the original illegal acquisition.
*   The reliance on financial capacity to overcome the presumption arising from registration of title.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court favored Borromeo, effectively upholding the constitutionality of land ownership through the "curing" doctrine, due to the transfer of property to a Filipino citizen, despite its initial acquisition by an alien.  The factual determination regarding financial capacity was crucial. A potential challenge would focus on undermining the factual basis for that determination.
