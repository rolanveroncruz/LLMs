**Case Summary: Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 176504 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Ferdinand A. Cruz for Qualified Theft.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Accused, Ferdinand A. Cruz, as Marketing Manager of Porta-Phone Rentals, Inc., received P15,000 from a client (Hemisphere) as a refundable deposit but failed to remit it to the company.
*   Cruz issued an official receipt despite lacking authority.
*   Cruz claimed he remitted the amount to Luningning Morando, which she denied.
*   Cruz claimed he was owed reimbursements by the company, justifying his withholding of the funds.

**Elements of Qualified Theft Proven (People v. Bago, 386 Phil. 310 (2000); Article 310, RPC):**

*   Taking of personal property (P15,000).
*   Property belonged to Porta-Phone Rentals, Inc.
*   Taking without consent of the owner.
*   Intent to gain (animus lucrandi), supported by Cruz's admission of withholding funds pending reimbursement.
*   Taking without violence or intimidation.
*   Grave abuse of confidence: Cruz used his position to obtain and misappropriate the funds.

**Obligations:**

*   Employee's (Cruz) obligation to remit company funds received on behalf of Porta-Phone Rentals Inc.
*   Employer's (Porta-Phone) obligation to pay legitimate reimbursements (though this doesn't excuse theft).

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability: Cruz was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of qualified theft and was sentenced to imprisonment.
*   Civil liability: Cruz was ordered to indemnify Porta-Phone Rentals, Inc. in the amount of P15,000.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Labor Dispute Argument:** Cruz argued that the criminal case was related to a labor dispute, requiring clearance from the Department of Labor (DOJ Circular No. 16), and that the labor complaint was only to recover his salary for the month of November, after the criminal event. The Court rejected this, noting that the theft occurred before the accrual of Cruz's money claim, and that the crime happened on the 25th of October, whereas the company owed salary for the month of November.
*   **Due Process (Preliminary Investigation):** Cruz claimed denial of due process due to being initially investigated for Estafa/Falsification of Private Document, and not for Qualified Theft. The court found that the Prosecutor has power to change the charge of the initial crime from estafa to qualified theft, based on same evidence brought by the complainant, and dismissed this argument because Cruz filed counter-affidavits and entered a plea of not guilty.
*   **Retracted Affidavit of Desistance:** Juanito Tan initially executed an affidavit of desistance but later retracted it. The court weighed the retraction and affirmed Juanito's testimony.
*   **Conflicting Testimony:** Cruz alleged he remitted the funds to Luningning, who denied this. The court favored Luningning's testimony, finding Cruz's explanation implausible.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 310, Revised Penal Code:** Defines qualified theft.
*   **Article 309, Revised Penal Code:** Specifies penalties for theft.
*   **People v. Bago, 386 Phil. 310 (2000):** Outlines elements of theft.
*   **Avecilla v. People, G.R. No. 46370, 2 June 1992, 209 SCRA 466:** Establishes that intent to gain (animus lucrandi) is presumed to be alleged in an information.
*   **Kuizon v. Desierto, 406 Phil. 611, 630 (2001):** Waiving the right to question any irregularity.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent, though the conflicting testimonies of Cruz and Luningning created a factual dispute resolved against Cruz.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Ferdinand A. Cruz for Qualified Theft, finding that the prosecution had proven all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court rejected Cruz's arguments regarding due process, labor dispute implications, and the retraction of the affidavit of desistance, the labor case, and upheld the Court of Appeals decision with modification of the maximum sentence.
