**Case Summary: *People v. Asjali*, G.R. No. 216430 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming the RTC conviction of Yasser Abbas Asjali for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Dangerous Drugs Act).  The Supreme Court *reversed* the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charges:** Illegal sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165) and illegal possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165) of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu).
*   **Chain of Custody:** The central issue revolves around a break in the chain of custody of the seized drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 and IRR:** Non-compliance with Section 21(a), Article II of RA 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), specifically regarding:
    *   **Marking:**  The marking of seized drugs was *not* done immediately upon arrest in the presence of the accused by the arresting officers. It was performed later at the police station by the investigating officer.
    *   **Inventory & Photography:** No evidence of physical inventory and photography of the seized drugs immediately after seizure, nor compliance with witness requirements (accused/counsel, media, DOJ, elected official).  No inventory receipt or photographs attached to the records.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The Supreme Court held that the prosecution failed to establish the *corpus delicti* due to the broken chain of custody.  The identity and integrity of the seized drugs were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **"Saving Clause" of IRR Sec. 21:**  The Court found that the prosecution failed to justify its non-compliance with the required procedures, thereby precluding reliance on the "saving clause" in the IRR regarding preservation of integrity/evidentiary value.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving the elements of the offenses *and* establishing an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Apprehending Officers' Duties:**  The apprehending officers have specific statutory duties regarding marking, inventory, and photography immediately after seizure.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Justification for Non-Compliance:** The lack of explanation for the failure to adhere to Section 21 and its IRR was fatal to the prosecution's case.
*   **Reliance on Investigating Officer's Actions:** The reliance on the investigating officer's (P/Insp. Tubo) actions (marking) instead of the apprehending officers' actions created a gap in the chain of custody.
*   **Ambiguity:** The decision implicitly highlights the potential ambiguity in the "saving clause" of the IRR and the need for clear and convincing evidence to invoke it.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Calates*, G.R. No. 214759
*   *People v. Calvelo*, G.R. No. 223526
*   *People v. Gonzales*, 708 Phil. 121
*   *People v. Dela Rosa*, G.R. No. 230228

**Conclusion:**

The *Asjali* case underscores the critical importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases, particularly the immediate post-seizure procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 and its IRR.  The decision clarifies that the prosecution cannot simply rely on the presumption of regularity and must provide justifiable reasons for any deviations from the prescribed procedures.  The burden lies squarely on the prosecution to demonstrate an unbroken chain of custody and preserve the integrity of the seized drugs. Failure to do so will lead to acquittal, regardless of the defendant's own evidence.
