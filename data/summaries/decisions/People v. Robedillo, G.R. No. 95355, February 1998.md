## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Robedillo*, G.R. No. 95355 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting accused-appellants Eduardo Robedillo and Anacleto Novio (and Artemio Yepes, now deceased) of murder, and sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* and joint and several indemnity to the victim's heirs.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The information alleged conspiracy, treachery, and abuse of superior strength.
*   **Facts:** Victim Martiano Cinco was attacked and killed by the accused with bolos after being lured to a party. Two eyewitnesses (victim's son and common-law wife) testified to the attack.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Conviction of murder based on eyewitness testimony and the nature of the wounds.
*   **Supreme Court (SC) Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision, *with modification* increasing civil indemnity.
*   **Conspiracy:** SC held that the accused acted in concert, demonstrating a common intent to kill, despite possibly alternating blows. No prior agreement necessary; their actions manifested a conspiracy. Cites *People v. Landicho* (258 SCRA 1 (1996)) and *People v. Bernal* (254 SCRA 659 (1996)).
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Found to be a qualifying circumstance due to the accused's coordinated attack, surrounding the victim to block escape, and overwhelming numerical superiority.
*   **Alibi (Anacleto Novio):** Rejected in light of positive eyewitness identification. Cites *People v. Cabodoc* (263 SCRA 187 (1996)) and other cases.
*   **Flight (Anacleto Novio):** Considered an indication of guilt. Cites *People v. Doro*, G.R. No. 104145 (1997) and other cases.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** Increased from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00 to reflect current jurisprudence. Cites *People v. Trilles* (254 SCRA 633 (1996)).

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant Eduardo Robedillo: Obligation to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil indemnity. Commitment to the Bureau of Corrections ordered.
*   Heirs of Martiano Cinco: Entitlement to P50,000.00 in civil indemnity.
*   Trial Court: Obligation to order the arrest of Anacleto Novio, forfeiture of his bail bond, and commitment of Eduardo Robedillo.

**Liabilities:**

*   Eduardo Robedillo: Criminally liable for murder, civilly liable for indemnity.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** (at the time of the ruling) Enforcement of Anacleto Novio's arrest warrant and forfeiture of bail. Potential difficulties if he remained at large.
*   **Robedillo's commitment:** Risk of non-compliance with the order of commitment.
*   **Factual Issues:** Reliance on eyewitness testimony.  Any subsequent evidence that could cast doubt on their credibility.
*   **Change in Law:** Possible changes in jurisprudence regarding civil indemnity or the elements of murder.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of conspiracy based solely on the coordinated actions at the time of the crime may be subject to debate. Defense could argue the lack of a pre-existing agreement.
*   Application of the ruling in *People v. Narciso*: The defense's attempt to apply *Narciso* was rejected, but similar arguments might arise in future appeals based on specific factual nuances.
