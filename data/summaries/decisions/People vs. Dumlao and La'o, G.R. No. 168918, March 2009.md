## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Dumlao and La'o* (G.R. No. 168918)

This is a Supreme Court decision reversing the Sandiganbayan's dismissal of Criminal Case No. 16699 against Hermenegildo Dumlao, charged with violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The Sandiganbayan dismissed the case based on a perceived lack of evidence, specifically that the GSIS Board Resolution approving a lease-purchase agreement with Emilio La'o (also a respondent, now deceased) was not validly passed due to an insufficient number of signatures on the *minutes* of the meeting.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019. Accusation is that Dumlao, as a GSIS Trustee, conspired to enter into a lease-purchase agreement with La'o that was manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government. The agreement involved the sale of GSIS property (Government Counsel Centre) to La'o.
*   **Agreement:** The core of the case revolves around a Lease-Purchase Agreement among the GSIS, the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), and Emilio La'o.
*   **Motion to Dismiss/Quash (by Dumlao):** Argued that the *facts charged do not constitute an offense* because the GSIS Board Resolution approving the lease-purchase agreement was not validly approved due to lack of a quorum and proper signatures on the meeting minutes.
*   **Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Granted Dumlao's motion, dismissing the case, reasoning that because only three of seven GSIS Board members signed the minutes of the meeting, the resolution was not validly passed.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the Sandiganbayan's dismissal.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Dumlao:** Allegedly liable for violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019, due to his alleged participation in approving the disadvantageous lease-purchase agreement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal of Dismissal:** Dumlao now faces trial on the original charge.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Key issue will be proving (1) Dumlao's involvement, (2) the validity of the Board Resolution, and (3) that the lease-purchase agreement was *grossly and manifestly disadvantageous* to the government.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 3(g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Defines the offense charged.
*   **Rule 117, Section 3 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Enumerates grounds for a Motion to Quash. The Court emphasizes that insufficiency of evidence is not a ground for a motion to quash *before* the prosecution rests its case.
*   **Rule 119, Section 23 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Discusses demurrer to evidence as appropriate only *after* the prosecution rests.
*   **Rule 130, Section 44 of the Revised Rules on Evidence:** Discusses Entries in Official Records and that entries made by a public officer in the performance of their duties, or by a person performing a duty specifically enjoined by law, are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.
*   **Corporation Code of the Philippines (BP 68):** Cited regarding the role of a Corporate Secretary and probative value of board minutes.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Court holds that double jeopardy did not attach because the Sandiganbayan's dismissal violated the prosecution's right to due process. *People v. Gomez* (126 Phil. 640, 645 (1967)) and *People v. Bocar* (G.R. No. L-27935, 16 August 1985, 138 SCRA 166, 171) are cited.
*   **Equal Protection:** Dumlao's claim of unequal protection is rejected, citing *Santos v. People* (G.R. No.173176, 26 August 2008). *People v. Dela Piedra* (403 Phil. 31 (2001)). The Court found no clear and intentional discrimination in charging Dumlao.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the GSIS Board Resolution:** The core dispute. The Sandiganbayan focused on the number of signatures on the *minutes* of the meeting, while the Supreme Court emphasized that the minutes are distinct from the *resolution* itself, with different requirements for validity. The minutes of the meeting of April 23, 1982 were certified by the Deputy Corporate Secretary (Antonio Eduardo B. Nachura) and confirmed by Leonilo M. Ocampo, Chairman of the GSIS Board of Trustees. These carry the presumption of regularity in the performance of his functions and duties.
*   **"Grossly and Manifestly Disadvantageous":** This element of Section 3(g) will likely be heavily contested during trial. Defining "grossly and manifestly disadvantageous" is often a contentious issue in anti-graft cases.
*   **Conspiracy:** Since the alleged co-conspirators are either deceased, acquitted, or not charged, the trial court will have to determine whether the prosecution can still prove conspiracy in light of these circumstances.

**Note:** The case against co-respondent La'o was dismissed due to his death.
