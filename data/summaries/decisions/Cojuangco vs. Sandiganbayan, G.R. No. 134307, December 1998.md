## Legal Document Summary: Cojuangco, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan

**Case Citation:** 360 Phil. 559 (G.R. No. 134307, December 21, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Prohibition under Rule 65 seeking dismissal of Criminal Case No. 22018 pending before the Sandiganbayan, invoking constitutional rights to due process, speedy trial, and speedy disposition of cases, and challenging the court's hold-departure order.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Violation of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Petitioner, along with others, was charged with conspiring to grant unwarranted benefits to COCOFED using PCA funds. Specific violation alleged is Section 3(e).
*   **Validity of Warrant of Arrest:** Petitioner argues the warrant of arrest issued by the Sandiganbayan was null and void because the court relied solely on the Ombudsman's resolution and the Special Prosecutor's Memorandum, violating his right under Section 2, Article III of the Constitution. Relies on *Ho vs. People* (280 SCRA 365) which requires independent judicial determination of probable cause, not just reliance on the prosecutor's report.
*   **Jurisdiction of Sandiganbayan:** The critical issue is whether the Sandiganbayan acquired jurisdiction over the petitioner, considering the allegedly invalid warrant. Respondents argue that Cojuangco submitted to the court's jurisdiction by posting bail and filing motions seeking affirmative relief (travel requests, etc.), waiving any objections to the warrant's validity. Petitioner disputes this, claiming his actions were intended to mitigate the impact of an unlawful arrest.
*   **Violation of Right to Speedy Trial/Disposition:** Petitioner alleges a violation of his constitutional right to a speedy trial and speedy disposition of the case due to the delay in resolving his motion to dismiss, filed after the Special Prosecutor recommended dismissal.
*   **Hold-Departure Order:** Petitioner challenges the ban on foreign travel, arguing it hinders his duties as Chairman and CEO of San Miguel Corporation (SMC). The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) does not object to lifting the ban.
* Crespo vs. Mogul Rule: After the filing of the information in court, any disposition of the case as to its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court.
* Torralba vs. Sandiganbayan- where there has been a deprivation of right to a full preliminary investigation, the Sandiganbayan is to hold in abeyance any further proceedings therein and to remand the case to the Office of the Ombudsman for the completion of the preliminary investigation, the outcome of which shall then be endorsed to Sandiganbayan for its appropriate action.

**Obligations:**

*   **Sandiganbayan:** To resolve pending motions with dispatch, particularly the Motion to Dismiss.
*   **Petitioner:** Potentially obligated to comply with travel restrictions if imposed by the Sandiganbayan, although the current order is lifted for a limited period.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Petitioner:** Potential conviction under R.A. No. 3019 if the Sandiganbayan denies the motion to dismiss and proceeds with the case. Risks potential travel restrictions or the like if he seeks leave to travel out of the country

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Section 2, Article III, 1987 Constitution:** Right against unreasonable searches and seizures and requirement of probable cause for warrants.
*   **R.A. No. 3019, Section 3(e) (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Prohibits causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits to private parties through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):**
* **Ho vs. People:** Held that a judge cannot issue a warrant of arrest solely based on the prosecutor's findings; there must be an independent determination of probable cause.
* Crespo vs. Mogul.
* Torralba vs. Sandiganbayan.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Waiver of Objection to Jurisdiction:** The extent to which posting bail and seeking travel permission constituted a waiver of the objection to the warrant's validity is a key point of contention.
*   **Violation of Speedy Trial/Disposition:** Whether the delay constitutes a violation of petitioner's constitutional rights and warrants dismissal of the case is debatable.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Sandiganbayan, despite the invalid warrant, retains jurisdiction due to petitioner's actions.
*   The Sandiganbayan may deny the motion to dismiss, leading to a full trial.
*   Future travel requests could be denied or heavily restricted.

**Outcome:**

*   The petition to dismiss Criminal Case No. 22018 was dismissed.
*   The Sandiganbayan was ordered to resolve the pending motions in the case with utmost dispatch.
*   The ban on petitioner's travel abroad without prior approval was lifted for three months from finality of the decision, with future requests to be addressed to the Sandiganbayan.
