## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Rebuton and Rebutazo* (G.R. No. 224581)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration of a prior ruling affirming the conviction of accused-appellants for violations of Sections 5, 11, and 12 of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Diosdado Rebuton and Marilou Rebutazo were charged with illegal sale (Sec. 5), possession (Sec. 11), and possession of drug paraphernalia (Sec. 12) under R.A. 9165 based on a buy-bust operation.
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Buy-bust operation based on confidential information. Poseur-buyer purchased shabu from Rebuton with Rebutazo's involvement. Apprehension inside Rebuton's house, where more drugs and paraphernalia were found.
*   **Defense's Case:** Denial and frame-up, claiming police planted evidence. They admitted to sniffing shabu but claimed they had already consumed what they bought.
*   **Prior Rulings:** RTC convicted both accused. CA affirmed. SC initially affirmed.
*   **SC Ruling on MR:** The Supreme Court *reversed* its previous ruling, granting the Motion for Reconsideration and *acquitting* both accused.
*   **Rationale:** The Court found a significant *break in the chain of custody* of the seized drugs. The required insulating witnesses (media, DOJ, PDEA, barangay) were *not present* at the time of apprehension, nor "at or near" the place of the buy-bust operation, as required by *Nisperos v. People* (G.R. No. 250927). Witnesses arrived 30 minutes later after the marking of evidence. The prosecution offered no justification for this non-compliance. The Court citing *Mallillin v. People*, emphasized that the prosecution’s failure to demonstrate compliance with just one of the links of the chain of custody and failure to provide any justifiable reason for the non-compliance create reasonable doubt that the substance confiscated from the accused is the same substance presented in court.
*   **Re: Rebuton (Non-Movant):** SC applied Section 11, Rule 122 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, extending the favorable judgment to Rebuton, even though he did not file a motion for reconsideration, because the acquittal was based on the *same corpus delicti* for the offenses charged against both parties.

**Obligations:**

*   The primary obligation lies with law enforcement to *strictly comply* with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 regarding the chain of custody of seized drugs, and to provide clear and convincing evidence of such compliance.
*   Prosecution has the burden of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities:**

*   The original RTC and CA rulings held the accused liable for penalties under Sections 5, 11, and 12 of R.A. 9165 (life imprisonment and fines for sale and possession, imprisonment and fines for paraphernalia possession). However, the SC decision removes these liabilities.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The case hinges on the stringent requirements of the chain of custody rule.
*   The "at or near" proximity requirement for insulating witnesses is critical in buy-bust operations, and this case highlights the necessity for pre-planning and logistical preparation to ensure their timely presence.
*   The application of Section 11, Rule 122 to Rebuton, despite his non-participation in the motion for reconsideration, demonstrates the importance of a unified defense strategy when multiple defendants are involved in a case based on the same evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sections 5, 11, and 12:** Defines the crimes and penalties for illegal sale, possession, and possession of drug paraphernalia.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165:** Governs the chain of custody requirements for drug cases.
*   ***Nisperos v. People* (G.R. No. 250927):** Establishes the requirement that insulating witnesses be present "at or near" the place of apprehension during a buy-bust operation.
*   ***Mallilin v. People*, 576 Phil. 576, 588 (2008)**  Emphasized the importance of preserving the identity and integrity of the corpus delicti.
*   **Section 11, Rule 122 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Allows favorable judgments on appeal to benefit co-accused who did not appeal.
*   **Estipona v. Lobrigo, 816 Phil. 789 (2017):** This ruling allows for the possibility of plea bargaining in drug cases. While cited in the accused’s Omnibus Motion, the motion was ultimately denied as moot due to the acquittal.

**Conclusion:**

This case is a significant victory for the accused, emphasizing the critical importance of strict adherence to chain of custody requirements in drug cases, especially the presence of insulating witnesses. This decision demonstrates the SC's commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of the accused and ensuring that the prosecution meets its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision is not merely a technicality, but a recognition that a flawed chain of custody creates reasonable doubt as to whether the evidence presented in court is the same as that recovered from the accused.
