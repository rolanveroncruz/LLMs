## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Domingo*, G.R. No. 177136

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Arturo Domingo for three counts of rape under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 8353.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Accused, alleged stepfather, charged with multiple rapes of his stepdaughter (AAA), a minor at the time of the offenses, involving force, violence, and intimidation.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Positive identification by victim AAA, detailing acts of rape with threats of violence. Medical evidence indicated a "non-virgin state" with healed lacerations.
*   **Defense:** Denial and alibi. Claimed the victim fabricated the charges at the instigation of her grandmother due to quarrels with the accused's common-law wife (the victim's mother). Implied a consensual relationship due to the victim's alleged late returns from school and scoldings.
*   **RTC Decision:** Convicted the accused of three counts of rape, imposing the death penalty for each count.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the conviction but reduced the penalty from death to *reclusion perpetua*, noting the prosecution failed to conclusively prove the qualifying circumstances of the victim's minority and the stepfather-stepdaughter relationship.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Convicted of three counts of rape and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* with accessory penalties. Obligated to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the victim for each count.
*   **State:** Obligation to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Failed to conclusively prove minority and the qualifying relationship of stepfather/stepdaughter.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Qualifying Circumstances:** The prosecution failed to establish the stepfather-stepdaughter relationship (marriage certificate not presented) and AAA's minority (birth certificate not presented) with sufficient evidence, as mandated in *People v. Barcena* (G.R. No. 168737) and *People v. Pruna* (439 Phil. 440). Reliance on the victim's testimony alone, without corroborating documentation, was deemed insufficient. The CA reversed the death sentence and is a main point of contention.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** Delay in reporting the rape was addressed but is often an indicator of an unsubstantiated claim. The court found the fear instilled by the accused sufficient justification for the delay.
*   **Victim's Credibility:** The defense argued that the victim willingly removed her clothes, lacked resistance, and delayed reporting, impacting her credibility. The Court rejected this argument, citing the psychological pressure exerted by the accused's threats and the fear of violence.
*   **"Use of Force" vs "Intimidation":** The prosecution's proof must meet the "elements" test to confirm if the threats by the accused meet the criminal threshold under the RPC.

**Statutory References:**

*   Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. No. 8353 (rape).

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Mateo* (G.R. Nos. 147678-87) (intermediate review of death penalty cases).
*   *People v. Cabalquinto* (G.R. No.167693) (protection of the victim's identity).
*   *People v. Barcena* (G.R. No. 168737) (evidence required to prove the victim's age).
*   *People v. Pruna* (439 Phil. 440) (evidence required to prove the victim's age).

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, dismissing the appeal and upholding the conviction of Arturo Domingo for three counts of rape, with the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*. It deleted the award of exemplary damages because no ordinary or qualifying aggravating circumstance was proven. The award of civil indemnity and moral damages was affirmed.

**Overall Assessment:** While the conviction was upheld, the failure to conclusively prove the aggravating circumstances led to the reduction of the penalty. This case highlights the importance of presenting concrete evidence to establish all elements of the crime, including qualifying circumstances, to ensure the imposition of the appropriate penalty. The defense's reliance on challenging the victim's credibility and the delay in reporting were unsuccessful, due to the presence of direct testimony and the court's acceptance of the victim's explanation for the delay.
