**Case:** *Genaro Santiago III v. Justice Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr.* (A.M. No. CA-09-47-J, February 13, 2009)

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against a Court of Appeals Justice.

**Key Issue:** Whether Justice Enriquez committed gross ignorance of the law/gross incompetence in rendering a decision (CA-G.R. CV No. 84167) reversing the RTC's grant of a petition for reconstitution of a lost Original Certificate of Title.

**Summary:**

Complainant Genaro Santiago III filed an administrative complaint against Justice Juan Q. Enriquez, Jr., alleging gross ignorance of law and incompetence based on the Justice's ponencia in CA-G.R. CV No. 84167, which reversed the RTC decision favorable to Santiago. Santiago asserted that Justice Enriquez deliberately twisted the law and jurisprudence despite overwhelming evidence presented during the trial.  The Court of Appeals Special Division ultimately sided with Justice Enriquez, with Justices Cruz and Veloso concurring, leading to the reversal of the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Complainant's Argument:** Justice Enriquez's decision disregarded substantial evidence supporting the reconstitution.
*   **Justice Enriquez's Defense:** The decision had factual and legal bases, and the complaint was a harassment tactic. The complaint was also premature because a Motion for Reconsideration was pending.  Furthermore, the Justice argued that an administrative complaint isn't the proper venue to challenge the merits of a judicial decision.
*   **Court's Ruling:**  The Supreme Court dismissed the complaint.
*   **Judicial Immunity:** Judges are insulated from liability for erroneous decisions rendered in good faith. *Tan Tiac Chiong v. Hon. Cosico, 434 Phil. 753, 762 (2002).* An administrative complaint is not an appropriate remedy where judicial recourse is still available, unless the assailed order or decision is tainted with fraud, malice, or dishonesty *Cortes v. Sandiganbayan, 467 Phil. 155 (2004).*
*   **Collective Decision:** The decision was a product of consultation and deliberation by a division of the Court of Appeals, therefore, a complaint against a single member is inappropriate. Citing *Bautista v. Abdulwahid, A.M. OCA IPI No. 06-97-CA-J, May 2, 2006, 488 SCRA 428*

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   While the complaint was dismissed, the case highlights the potential for administrative scrutiny of judicial decisions. The risk lies in a decision being *tainted* with fraud, malice or dishonesty or was rendered with deliberate intent to cause injustice, removing it from the protection of judicial immunity.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 137, Section 1, Paragraph 2:** (Motion for Disqualification/Inhibition based on pending administrative complaint - motion was denied).
*   **Cortes v. Sandiganbayan, 467 Phil. 155 (2004):**  Reiterates the standard for administrative liability: a decision must be tainted with fraud, malice, dishonesty, or deliberate intent to cause injustice.
*   **Tan Tiac Chiong v. Hon. Cosico, 434 Phil. 753, 762 (2002):**  Reinforces the principle of judicial immunity for decisions rendered in good faith.
*   **Bautista v. Abdulwahid, A.M. OCA IPI No. 06-97-CA-J, May 2, 2006, 488 SCRA 428:** Emphasizes that a collective decision of a collegiate court cannot be the basis for a charge of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.

**Potential Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The threshold for demonstrating "fraud, malice, dishonesty, or deliberate intent to cause injustice" remains somewhat subjective.
*   The definition of "good faith" in the context of judicial decision-making can be a point of contention, particularly when challenging complex legal interpretations.

**Conclusion:**

The case reinforces judicial immunity for judges making decisions in good faith and underscores the importance of using appropriate judicial remedies (e.g., appeals, petitions for certiorari) rather than administrative complaints to challenge the merits of a decision. It would be best to consider whether the decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 84167 contains any indicia of bad faith, malice, or deliberate intent, for example, any prior relationships between the parties, or clear misrepresentations or omissions in the decision.
