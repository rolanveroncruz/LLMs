**Case:** *Norma M. Baleares, et al. v. Felipe B. Espanto* (G.R. No. 229645, June 6, 2018)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision in an unlawful detainer case, ruling in favor of the petitioners (the Baleares heirs) over the respondent (Espanto) regarding the possession of a property in Makati City. The core issue was which party had a better right of *de facto* possession.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Property Ownership History:** The subject property was originally co-owned by the Baleares siblings, including Santos Baleares (petitioners' predecessor). The property was mortgaged to Arnold Maranan in 1988.
*   **Mortgage Foreclosure:** The property was allegedly foreclosed and sold at public auction to Arnold in 1996, but the validity of the foreclosure was challenged.
*   **Prior Litigation (Civil Case No. 98-1360):** The Baleares heirs successfully sued Arnold to cancel the mortgage inscription based on prescription. The RTC's ruling, affirmed by the CA, declared the extrajudicial foreclosure and auction sale void for non-compliance with notice requirements under Act No. 3135.
*   **Transfer to Espanto:** Despite the adverse ruling in Civil Case No. 98-1360, Arnold sold the property to Espanto, who obtained a Torrens title.
*   **Unlawful Detainer Action:** Espanto filed an unlawful detainer action against the Baleares heirs, who were occupying the property. The MeTC and RTC ruled in favor of Espanto, but the CA was reversed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court held that the Baleares heirs had a better right of possession. Espanto, as a transferee of Arnold, was bound by the final judgment in Civil Case No. 98-1360, which invalidated Arnold's foreclosure. Espanto had knowledge of the cancellation of Arnold's rights before the transfer. The court stressed that the ruling was solely on the right of possession *de facto* and does not preclude a separate action to determine ownership.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Espanto was obligated to respect the final judgment in Civil Case No. 98-1360.
*   Espanto was liable for legal fees and costs associated with the ejectment actions.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** The Supreme Court explicitly stated that the ruling only concerned possession and did not resolve the underlying issue of ownership. A separate action to quiet title or determine ownership is likely. The petitioners can pursue a case for reconveyance of title.
*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** The Supreme Court seemingly applied a form of collateral estoppel against Espanto, as he stood in the shoes of his transferor, Arnold, who lost the previous case.
*   **Transferee Pendente Lite:** The petitioners argued that Espanto was a transferee *pendente lite*, which would have further strengthened their case. The Supreme Court did not explicitly address this argument, but its decision implies a similar effect.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Cited regarding notice and publication requirements for foreclosure sales, the non-compliance of which led to the invalidation of the initial foreclosure.
*   **Rule 70 of the Rules of Court (Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer):** Governs the procedural aspects of ejectment cases.
*   ***Corpuz v. Sps. Agustin, G.R. No. 183822, January 18, 2012.*** Cited with regards to *de facto* possession and the issue of ownership.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The role of the respondent as a good faith purchaser for value may be questionable. Though they had a Torrens Title, their knowledge of the prior case negated such claim.
*   The relationship between the prior case(Civil Case No. 98-1360) and the unlawful detainer suit. This is resolved by recognizing that only the *de facto* possession is to be discussed.
