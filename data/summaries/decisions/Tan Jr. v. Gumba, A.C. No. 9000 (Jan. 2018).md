**Legal Document Summary: *Tan v. Gumba*, A.C. No. 9000**

**Subject:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Haide V. Gumba for violation of a prior suspension order and failure to comply with requirements for its lifting.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Original Cause:** Atty. Gumba previously suspended for 6 months for dishonesty in a loan transaction (Deed of Absolute Sale secured against a property with an SPA only authorizing a mortgage). This case concerns subsequent actions during and after that suspension.
*   **Violation of Suspension Order:** The primary issue is whether Atty. Gumba engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by filing pleadings and appearing in court between November 12, 2012 (date of receipt of denial of motion for reconsideration on the initial suspension) and May 12, 2013, and thereafter, before the lifting of the suspension order. The OBC Report cites specific cases (Civil Case No. 2013-0106, Civil Case No. RTC 2006-0063, Other Spec. Proc. No. RTC 2012-0019) where Gumba allegedly engaged in such unauthorized practice.
*   **Failure to Comply with Lifting Requirements:** Atty. Gumba failed to file a sworn statement as required by *Maniago v. Atty. De Dios* (631 Phil. 139 (2010)) after the suspension period, affirming desistance from practice and providing certifications from the Executive Judge and IBP Local Chapter.  Instead, she filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 2015-0007) in the RTC questioning the actions of the OCA and OBC, which was subsequently dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
*   **Service of Suspension Order:** While the Court acknowledges that mere downloading of the suspension resolution is insufficient notice, the fact that Gumba filed a motion for reconsideration proves she was aware of the suspension.
*   **Definition of Practice of Law:** The decision reiterates the broad definition of "practice of law" as any activity requiring legal knowledge, skill, training, and experience, both in and out of court.
*   **Applicable Law and Case Law:**
    *   Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court: Grounds for disbarment or suspension, specifically "willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court."
    *   *Maniago v. Atty. De Dios*: Establishes the procedure for lifting a suspension order.
    *   *Ibana-Andrade v. Atty. Paita-Moya* and *Feliciano v. Atty. Bautista-Lozada*: Similar cases involving unauthorized practice during suspension, resulting in additional penalties.
*   **IBP's Role:** The IBP's initial resolution dismissing the complaint against Gumba is noted, and the IBP was directed to explain why it should not be sanctioned for disciplinary action for dismissing this case for lack of merit.
*   **Ruling:** Atty. Gumba is found administratively liable for continuing to practice law while under suspension and for failing to comply with the requirements for lifting the suspension order.  She is suspended for an additional six (6) months.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Gumba has a positive obligation to cease all activities constituting the practice of law during the suspension period.
*   She has an obligation to comply with the *Maniago* guidelines for lifting the suspension, specifically the filing of a sworn statement and certifications.
*   She is liable for further disciplinary action, including disbarment, for future violations.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The finding of "willful disobedience" could be challenged, although the facts appear to strongly support it given Gumba's awareness of the suspension and continued practice.
*   The delay between the events and this decision could be a mitigating factor, although it doesn't excuse the misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

This case represents a serious breach of professional ethics. Atty. Gumba's actions show a disregard for the authority of the Court and the integrity of the legal profession. The additional suspension is appropriate, and future violations will likely result in more severe consequences.
