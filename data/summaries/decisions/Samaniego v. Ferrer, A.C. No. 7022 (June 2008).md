**Case:** *Marjorie F. Samaniego v. Atty. Andrew V. Ferrer*, A.C. No. 7022 (2008)

**Summary:**

This is a disciplinary action against Atty. Andrew V. Ferrer for gross immorality and failure to support his child, stemming from an affair with his client, Marjorie F. Samaniego, while he was married with ten children. The IBP recommended a 6-month suspension, which the Supreme Court affirmed.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Admission of Affair:** Atty. Ferrer admitted to the affair with Ms. Samaniego.
*   **Birth of Child:** A child was born out of the affair.
*   **Failure to Support:** While initially charged, Ferrer manifested his willingness to support their daughter.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** Atty. Ferrer was suspended from the practice of law for six months.
*   **Affirmation of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** The court re-emphasized the lawyer's duty to uphold the integrity of the profession and avoid immoral conduct (Rules 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility).

**Obligations:**

*   Atty. Ferrer has an obligation to support his child with Ms. Samaniego.
*   He is obligated to comply with the 6-month suspension from practice.
*   He is obligated to report the date of his receipt of the Supreme Court's decision.
*   He is obligated to uphold the ethical standards of the legal profession.

**Liabilities:**

*   Disciplinary action in the form of a 6-month suspension. Further violations could result in more severe penalties.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Misconduct:** The Court warned that similar acts in the future would be dealt with more severely, possibly leading to disbarment (citing *Bustamante-Alejandro v. Alejandro* and *Guevarra v. Eala*).
*   **Reputational Damage:** The publication of the decision damages Atty. Ferrer's reputation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Rules 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03.
*   **Ferancullo v. Ferancullo, Jr.** A.C. No. 7214, November 30, 2006.
*   **Bustamante-Alejandro v. Alejandro,** A.C. No. 4256, February 13, 2004, 422 SCRA 527, 532-533;
*   **Guevarra v. Eala,** A.C. No. 7136, August 1, 2007, 529 SCRA 1, 21.
*   **Zaguirre v. Castillo,** Adm. Case No. 4921, March 6, 2003, 398 SCRA 658, 666.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court noted the complainant was "not entirely blameless" (in pari delicto), but clarified that her complicity does not excuse Atty. Ferrer's professional misconduct. This suggests that the complainant's role was considered, although it did not alter the outcome. The extent to which her knowledge of Ferrer's marital status played a role in the sanction is a matter of interpretation.

**Key Takeaway:** The case highlights the principle that lawyers are held to a high standard of moral conduct, and extramarital affairs, especially those resulting in children, can lead to disciplinary action, even if the other party is complicit. The case underscores the importance of upholding the integrity of the legal profession and the responsibilities of a parent.
