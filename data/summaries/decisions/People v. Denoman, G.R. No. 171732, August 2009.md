**Case Summary: *People v. Denoman*, G.R. No. 171732, August 14, 2009**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction for illegal sale of *shabu* under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165.

**Facts:** Accused-appellant Denoman was charged with both illegal possession and illegal sale of *shabu* in separate incidents. The RTC convicted him of illegal sale based on the testimony of PO1 Carlos, who acted as a poseur-buyer in a buy-bust operation.  The CA affirmed.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed and acquitted Denoman, finding the prosecution's evidence insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to critical failures in complying with the requirements of Section 21, paragraph 1, Article II of RA 9165 and its implementing rules. Specifically, the Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized drug.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs):** The charge against Denoman. Requires proof of identity of buyer and seller, the transaction or sale of the illegal drug, and the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Section 21, paragraph 1, Article II of RA 9165 & Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR of RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Mandates strict procedures for handling seized drugs to preserve their identity and integrity as evidence.  Requires immediate inventory and photographing of the drug after seizure, in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), media, DOJ, and an elected public official. Non-compliance can be excused under justifiable grounds, but the integrity and evidentiary value must be demonstrably preserved.

**Failures in Compliance:**

*   **Markings:** Lack of evidence as to who made the markings on the plastic sachet, when, and where.
*   **Inventory & Photograph:** No evidence presented to prove the buy-bust team did a physical inventory and photo of the seized illegal drug.
*   **Presence of Witnesses:** No evidence that the inventory and photo, if any, were made in the presence of the accused or his representatives, or with representatives from the media, DOJ, or any elected official.
*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:**
    *   No testimony regarding the handling and disposition of the seized plastic sachet immediately after the arrest, during transport to the hospital and police station, and who secured it.
    *   No identification of who made the markings on the plastic sachet and the place and time of such markings.
    *   No evidence linking the Chief Police Inspector who prepared the request for laboratory examination to receiving the shabu from the buy-bust team.
    *   Missing evidence regarding the temporary custody of the drug between the buy-bust on Feb 17 and the lab request on Feb 18.
    *   No evidence about who took the seized drug to the PNP Crime Laboratory, or the identity of the person who received the shabu for laboratory examination.
    *   No evidence showing compliance with Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 2 regarding documenting the chain of custody within the laboratory.

**Case Law & Legal Principles:**

*   **Strict Construction of Penal Laws:** Penal laws construed strictly against the government and liberally in favor of the accused (*People v. De la Cruz*, G.R. No. 177222, October 29, 2008).
*   ***Corpus Delicti*:** The body of the crime, in this case, the illegal drug itself. Failure to adequately prove the existence of the *corpus delicti* is fatal to the prosecution's case.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** Does not arise when lapses in procedure are evident from the record (*People v. Garcia*, G.R. No. 173480, February 25, 2009).
*   **Chain of Custody Cases:**
    *   *People v. Partoza*, G.R. No. 182418, May 8, 2009
    *   *People v. Robles*, G.R. No. 177220, April 24, 2009
    *   *People v. Garcia*, G.R. No. 173480, February 25, 2009
    *   *People v. Sanchez*, G.R. No. 181545, October 08, 2008
    *   *Lopez v. People*, G.R. No. 172953, April 30, 2008

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds Exception:** While the IRR allows for non-compliance with procedural requirements under "justifiable grounds," the prosecution failed to invoke this provision or explain the lapses.
*   **Weak Evidence:** Lack of details about the handling of the seized drug after the arrest creates a significant gap in the chain of custody, raising doubts about the authenticity and integrity of the evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Court acquitted Denoman due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and comply with the mandatory requirements of RA 9165, thus creating reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the seized drug and failing to establish the *corpus delicti*. This case emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in drug cases to safeguard the rights of the accused.
