**Legal Document Summary: *Aniceto G. Saludo, Jr. vs. Philippine National Bank***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision reinstating PNB's counterclaims against Saludo and the SAFA Law Office.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Partnership vs. Sole Proprietorship:** The central issue is whether the SAFA Law Office is a partnership or a sole proprietorship. The Court holds that it is a *partnership*, citing Articles 1767, 1768, 1771, 1772, and 1784 of the Civil Code, based on the Articles of Partnership filed with SEC.
*   **Juridical Personality:** The Court emphasizes that a partnership, even one for the practice of law, has a *juridical personality separate and distinct* from its partners (Art. 1768, Civil Code). This overrules the CA's reliance on *Petition for Authority to Continue Use of the Firm Name "Sycip, Salazar, Feliciano, Hernandez & Castillo"* (92 SCRA 1), deeming its statement about law firms not being legal entities as *obiter dictum*.
*   **Real Party-in-Interest:** Because of the partnership's juridical personality, SAFA Law Office, not Saludo individually, is the *real party-in-interest* in the lease contract dispute with PNB. The Court refers to Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court on defining a real party-in-interest and applies Art. 1816 of the Civil Code regarding partnership liability. *Aguila, Jr. v. Court of Appeals* (319 SCRA 246) is cited to support the view that the partnership should be impleaded when the cause of action is against the partnership itself.
*   **MOU Validity:** The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) shifting liabilities to Saludo alone is valid *only among the partners* (Art. 1817, Civil Code), not against third parties like PNB.

**Obligations:**

*   Saludo is ordered to *amend his complaint* to include SAFA Law Office as the plaintiff.
*   SAFA Law Office, as lessee, is obligated to pay PNB overdue rentals.

**Liabilities:**

*   SAFA Law Office's assets are primarily liable for the breach of contract. Partners have secondary liability (Art. 1816, Civil Code).
*   Saludo remains liable to SAFA for partnership obligations under the MOU

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prolonged Litigation:** Continued litigation due to procedural issues (partnership status, real party-in-interest).
*   **Partnership Liability:** All partners in SAFA Law Office may be held liable for the debt pro rata, subject to Art. 1816 of the Civil Code.
*   **Validity and enforceability of the lease contract** PNB might claim against all the partners' assets after exhausting the partnership assets.
*   **PNBâ€™s Counterclaims:** PNB can proceed with its counterclaims against SAFA Law Office for unpaid rent, which could be substantial.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **MOU Interpretation:** Potential disputes over the scope and interpretation of the MOU regarding the limitation of liabilities among partners, particularly concerning its impact on external creditors like PNB.
*   **Discount Promise:** PNB's failure to grant the promised discount.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Art. 44, 46, 1767, 1768, 1771, 1772, 1783, 1784, 1816, 1817.
*   Rules of Court: Rule 3, Sec. 2; Rule 3, Sec. 11; Rule 3, Sec. 15; Rule 6, Sec. 12.
