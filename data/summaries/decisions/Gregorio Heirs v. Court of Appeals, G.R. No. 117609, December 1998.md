## Legal Document Summary: Gregorio Heirs v. Court of Appeals, et al.

**Case:** *Heirs of Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. No. 117609, December 29, 1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision reversing the RTC ruling that nullified a Deed of Absolute Sale.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a deed of sale purportedly executed by Severa Gregorio in favor of Ricardo Santos, which ultimately led to the transfer of land ownership to Spouses Wilson and Benita Lui Tan. The heirs of Gregorio allege forgery.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Gregorio to Santos, July 14, 1971):** Allegedly forged. This is the core of the dispute. If forged, the subsequent transactions are potentially void.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Santos to Tans, September 17, 1986):** Conveys 2/3 portion of the land. Validity contingent on the legitimacy of the Gregorio-Santos deed.
*   **Deed of Assignment (Palomos to Tans, September 18, 1986):** Conveys 1/3 portion of the land acquired by the Palomos through execution sale against Jesusa Galang (Gregorio's daughter). The validity of this transfer is not under dispute in this appeal.
*   **TCT No. 349788:** Title issued to Spouses Tan covering the entire lot, after the registration of the above deeds. Subject to cancellation if prior deeds are deemed invalid.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Ricardo Santos:** Declared in default at trial level and ordered to pay attorney's fees and damages to the plaintiffs.
*   **Spouses Tan:** Risk losing title to the 2/3 portion if the Gregorio-Santos deed is proven forged.
*   **Heirs of Gregorio:** Bear the burden of proving the forgery of the Gregorio-Santos deed.
*   **Register of Deeds of Quezon City:** Potentially obligated to reinstate TCT No. 8787 in Severa Gregorio's name if prior transfers are invalidated.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Claim:** The central issue. The original deed was destroyed in a fire, leaving only a photocopy. This significantly hinders the establishment of forgery under the best evidence rule (Rule 130, Section 3, Revised Rules of Court). Expert testimony based on photocopies is deemed insufficient per *U.S. vs. Gregorio* (17 Phil. 522) and *Borje vs. Sandiganbayan* (125 SCRA 763 (1983)).
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The Court of Appeals found Spouses Tan to be innocent purchasers for value, relying on the clean title and their due diligence. However, this hinges on whether they had any notice of the forgery. Per jurisprudence in *Claudel vs. CA* and *Vda. de Jomos vs. CA*, mere registration is insufficient; good faith is essential.
*   **Destruction of Evidence:** The destruction of the original deed due to the fire presents a significant hurdle to proving forgery. The court's reliance on the best evidence rule makes it difficult for the Heirs to prevail.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Best Evidence Rule (Rule 130, Section 3, Revised Rules of Court):** Governs admissibility of evidence when the contents of a document are in question.
*   **U.S. vs. Gregorio (17 Phil. 522) and Borje vs. Sandiganbayan (125 SCRA 763 (1983)):** Regarding the inadmissibility of expert testimony based on photocopies for signature comparison.
*   **Claudel vs. CA; Vda. de Jomos vs. CA:** Emphasizing the requirement of good faith in addition to registration for indefeasibility of title.
*   **General Banking Act:** Relevant to the doctrine of mortgagee in good faith, which is analogous to good faith purchaser.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Points:**

*   **Sufficient Due Diligence:** Whether the Tans' actions (verifying the title, consulting a lawyer) constituted sufficient due diligence to establish them as good faith purchasers, considering the allegation of forgery.
*   **Weight of Expert Testimony:** Whether the NBI expert's examination of the original document before the fire, followed by testimony based on a photocopy, should have been given more weight, despite the lack of the original.

**Conclusion:**

The case hinges on the ability of the Heirs of Gregorio to overcome the significant evidentiary hurdle of the destroyed original deed. The Court of Appeals' decision favors the Spouses Tan based on their good faith and the clean title at the time of purchase. However, a strong argument could be made that the Tans should have conducted a more thorough investigation given the circumstances surrounding the sale. If the Gregorio's can present strong circumstantial evidence of forgery or that Tan's had knowledge of the forgery, they may have grounds for a further appeal.
