**Case Summary: *Salandanan vs. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 127783, June 5, 1998**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's denial of a motion to reopen estate proceedings and set aside a partition.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Probate Proceedings:** Testate estate of Vicenta Alviar was settled in Special Proceeding No. 4749. Will admitted to probate in 1957. Project of Partition approved in 1960, allegedly signed by all heirs, including Petitioners.
*   **Transfer of Shares:** In 1966, probate court approved the transfer of Petitioners’ shares to Elvira Pandinco (co-heir).
*   **Petitioners' Claims:** Petitioners allege they never signed the Project of Partition, never acknowledged it before a notary public, never sold their shares to Elvira Pandinco, and only learned of the 1966 Order in 1990.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** RTC denied the motion to reopen based on laches. CA affirmed, stating the proper remedy was a timely appeal.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Affirmed the CA decision, denying the petition.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** To diligently assert their rights. They failed to appeal the 1960 and 1966 Orders.
*   **Petitioners' Liability:**  Loss of claim due to laches (unreasonable delay in asserting rights).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Laches:** The core issue is whether the Petitioners' delay (approximately 29 years before filing the motion to reopen) constitutes laches. *Olizon vs. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 148* defines laches.
*   **Validity of Transfer:** Petitioners dispute the validity of the transfer of their shares to Elvira Pandinco. However, the probate court's 1966 order validated this transfer, and the failure to timely appeal that order is fatal to their claim.
*   **Lack of Appeal:**  Petitioners’ failure to timely appeal the orders approving the partition and the transfer is a significant obstacle. *Vda. De Kilayko vs. Tengco, 207 SCRA 612-613* is cited, emphasizing the finality of a decree of distribution.
*   **Due Diligence**: The court emphasizes that law aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Vigilantibus, sed non dormientibus jura subverniunt:**  The general legal principle favoring those who are vigilant in protecting their rights.
*   **Vda. De Kilayko vs. Tengco, 207 SCRA 612-613:**  Final decree of distribution vests title and becomes binding like a judgment in rem.
*   **Olizon vs. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 148:** Defines Laches.
*   **Catholic Bishop of Balanga vs Court of Appeals, 264 SCRA 193:**  Principle of laches.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core contention lies in the validity of the 1960 Project of Partition and the 1966 transfer. Petitioners claim lack of consent and knowledge, but these claims are weakened by the passage of time and the finality of the court orders.

**Legal Advice:**

The Supreme Court's decision strongly suggests that the Petitioners' case is unlikely to succeed. The doctrine of laches and the finality of the probate court's orders are significant barriers.
