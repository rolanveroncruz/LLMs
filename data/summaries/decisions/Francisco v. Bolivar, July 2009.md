**Case Summary: Francisco v. Bolivar, A.M. No. P-06-2212 (July 14, 2009)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Sheriff Sebastian Bolivar for dishonesty and abuse of authority.

**Facts:** Complainant Geronimo Francisco alleged irregularities in Sheriff Bolivar's implementation of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. RTC-3811, where Francisco was a plaintiff.  The judgment awarded damages to Francisco against the defendants. Bolivar is accused of demanding excessive fees, directly receiving funds from litigants (violating Rule 141, Sec. 10), failing to properly liquidate expenses, engaging in discourteous behavior toward Francisco, and improperly facilitating a compromise agreement that reduced the judgment amount.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 10 (Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC):**  Outlines the procedure for payment and liquidation of sheriff's expenses: Interested party pays expenses estimated by the sheriff, subject to court approval, deposits with the Clerk of Court, who disburses to the executing sheriff, subject to liquidation and court approval. Unspent amounts are refunded. *Violation:* Bolivar received funds directly from litigants, exceeded the court-approved estimated expenses (approved P7,500.00 expenses but received P12,500.00 and claimed to have spent P13,000), and failed to obtain court approval for liquidation.

*   **Canon I, Section 4 (Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Prohibits court personnel from accepting fees or remuneration beyond their entitlement in their official capacity. *Violation:* Bolivar accepted excess fees and did not provide sufficient documentation or receipts to justify the total claims of expenditures.

*   **Canon IV, Section 2 (Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Requires court personnel to carry out their responsibilities courteously. *Violation:* Bolivar acted discourteously and in an abrasive manner towards Francisco.

*   **Ministerial Duty of Sheriff:**  Sheriff's duty in executing a writ is purely ministerial (citing *De La Cruz v. Bato*).  He must execute the order strictly and has no discretion. *Violation:* Bolivar improperly facilitated a compromise agreement and accepted partial payment, exceeding his authority.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dishonesty:**  Unilateral demand for sums, purportedly for expenses, without court approval or proper accounting.
*   **Abuse of Authority/Oppression:**  Disregarding proper execution procedures, failing to notify the court of a compromise agreement.

**Penalties:**

*   Dishonesty and abuse of authority can be penalized with dismissal per Section 52(A)(1) and (14) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service Commission.
*   The Court imposed a suspension of two (2) years without pay, considering a prior administrative complaint against Bolivar.
**Risks:**

*   **Ambiguous Liquidation:**  Insufficient documentation for claimed expenses (only P3,500 of expenses were supported).
*   **Compromise Agreement:**  The sheriff's role in facilitating the compromise, reducing the judgment amount, creates a potential conflict of interest and raises questions about impartiality.
*   **Third-Party Claim:**  The sheriff's demand for a bond without a court order is questionable.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **De La Cruz v. Bato, A.M. No. P-05-1959 (Feb. 15, 2005):** Confirms the ministerial nature of a sheriff's duty.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, Section 10, Rules of Court:** Defines rules on payment and liquidations of sheriff's fees.
*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Mandates ethical conduct for court personnel, including prohibiting acceptance of excessive fees and maintaining courtesy.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service Commission:** Prescribes penalties for dishonesty and grave abuse of authority.
