## Legal Document Summary: *Navales v. Navales*, G.R. No. 167523

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Issue:** Whether Nilda Navales' marriage to Reynaldo Navales is null and void due to her alleged psychological incapacity.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA and RTC decisions, dismissing the petition for declaration of absolute nullity of marriage.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Reynaldo's Claim:** Nilda's alleged flirtatiousness, promiscuity (characterized by use of maiden name, interactions with other men), and refusal to bear children constitute psychological incapacity to fulfill marital obligations. This was supported by testimonial evidence and a psychological assessment.

*   **Nilda's Defense:** Reynaldo knew of her past, he was the unfaithful spouse, and she presented evidence to refute allegations of promiscuity (YMCA certification, PLDT statements in married name).

*   **RTC Ruling:** Nilda was psychologically incapacitated due to her failure to understand the effects of marriage, as evidenced by her behavior and the psychologist's report.

*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC, citing Nilda's concealment of marital status and nymphomania as grounds for psychological incapacity.

*   **SC Ruling:**
    *   **Insufficient Evidence of Psychological Incapacity:** The totality of evidence was insufficient to establish a serious, incurable, and grave psychological defect as contemplated by Article 36 of the Family Code. The alleged acts of flirtatiousness were insufficient to demonstrate an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage. Mere difficulty, refusal, or neglect is not the same as psychological incapacity.
    *   **Deficient Expert Testimony:** The psychologist's report concluding Nilda was a nymphomaniac and had other disorders was vague, sweeping, lacked sufficient factual bases, and did not adequately demonstrate a "natal or supervening disabling factor" existing before the marriage. It failed to show the root cause and to link them to the obligations of marriage under Art 68-71 and 220, 221 and 225 of the same code. The standards for psychological reports in nullity cases are high.
    *   **State's Participation Lacking:** While the City Prosecutor participated, their involvement was limited. The active participation of the Public Prosecutor or OSG is required under Article 48 of the Family Code to ensure the interest of the State is protected. This lack of participation raises concerns about potential collusion or fabrication of evidence.
    *   **Reliance on Post-Separation Evidence:** Evidence like telephone listings in Nilda's maiden name was gathered *after* separation, weakening the claim that she misrepresented her status during the marriage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Grounds for nullity based on psychological incapacity.
*   **Article 48, Family Code:** Requires state participation in annulment/nullity cases.
*   ***Santos v. Court of Appeals***, 310 Phil. 21 (1995): Established the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability criteria for psychological incapacity.
*   ***Republic of the Philippines v. Molina***, 335 Phil. 664 (1997): Provided guidelines for interpreting and applying Article 36, including the burden of proof, requirement for expert testimony, and the nature of the incapacity.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages):** Dispensed with the Molina requirement for an OSG certification.
*   ***Perez-Ferraris v. Ferraris***, G.R. No. 162368, July 17, 2006: Defines seriousness and incapacitation.
*   Articles 68-71 of the Family Code which regards obligations between husband and wife.
*   Articles 220, 221 and 225 of the same Code in regard to parents and their children.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of Psychological Incapacity:** The application of Article 36 remains highly fact-specific and subjective, leading to inconsistent rulings. The SC emphasizes the high burden of proof and strict interpretation to protect the sanctity of marriage.
*   **Expert Testimony Challenges:** The reliability and objectivity of expert psychological assessments are often challenged, particularly when based solely on information provided by one party. The Court demands rigorous methodologies and factual bases.
*   **State's Role:** The case highlights the importance of active state participation in nullity cases to prevent collusion or fabrication of evidence. Inadequate involvement can undermine the integrity of the proceedings.
*   **Difficulty in Proving Juridical Antecedence:** Establishing that the psychological incapacity existed at the time of marriage can be challenging, especially when manifestations only appear later. This requires strong evidence and expert analysis.

**Conclusion:**

The SC reversed the lower courts, reinforcing the principle that psychological incapacity must be a grave and deeply rooted condition, not merely marital difficulties or personality quirks. The case underscores the stringent evidentiary requirements for proving psychological incapacity and the importance of ensuring active state participation in nullity proceedings.
