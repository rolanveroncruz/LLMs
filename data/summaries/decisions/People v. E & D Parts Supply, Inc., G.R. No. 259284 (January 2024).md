Here's a concise legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. E & D Parts Supply, Inc. and Margaret L. Uy* (G.R. No. 259284, January 24, 2024)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc decision affirming the CTA Division's ruling that E & D Parts Supply, Inc. (E & D) could not be held civilly liable for deficiency taxes under Section 255 of the Tax Code due to its acquittal in a related criminal action.

**Facts:**

*   E & D, along with officers Cipriano and Margaret Uy, were charged with violations of Section 255 of the Tax Code (failure to pay income and VAT deficiencies for 2006).
*   The CTA Division granted the accused's Demurrer to Evidence, dismissing the criminal cases against Margaret (Cipriano's case was dismissed due to death).
*   The CTA ruled the prosecution failed to prove Margaret was a responsible officer of E & D, thus no criminal liability. The corresponding civil action was dismissed because the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist.
*   CTA En Banc affirmed the dismissal, stating Margaret's acquittal removed the element of "willfulness," preventing civil liability for E & D under Section 255.

**Issue:** Does the acquittal of the taxpayer-accused in a criminal case for tax law violation extinguish their civil liability for deficiency taxes?

**Ruling:**

No. The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the CTA's dismissal of the case against Margaret Uy, and affirming the lower courts' decisions that the criminal liability of Margaret did not attach to E & D. However, it clarifies that the exoneration of E & D from the liability to pay taxes is not due to its acquittal in the criminal cases.

*   **Separate Civil Liability:**  Citing *Republic v. Patanao*, the SC reiterated that the obligation to pay taxes is created by law and separate from any criminal act (delict). The obligation to pay taxes is independent of any criminal charge filed against the taxpayer for failing to comply with their duty to the State. Thus, acquittal in a criminal tax case doesn't automatically extinguish civil liability for deficiency taxes.
*   **Void Assessment:** The Court found that the tax assessment was void because it was issued without a valid Letter of Authority (LOA) as required by Sections 6, 10, and 13 of the Tax Code. A new revenue officer continued the examination of the books of accounts and other accounting records was only clothed with a Memorandum of Assignment and not a LOA. Citing *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. McDonald's Philippines Realty Corp.*, the court emphasized that a LOA is a special authority granted to a particular officer and that the absence of a valid LOA renders the assessment void. RO Anaban did not possess any authority to audit E & D's books of accounts. Thus, E&D cannot be held liable for the payment of deficiency taxes assessed therein.
* **Corporate liability:** The Court found that the prosecution did not only fail to prove Margaret's active participation in the non-payment of E & D's alleged deficiency income tax and VAT for taxable year 2006, the prosecution also failed to prove Margaret's role in the corporation when the crime was supposedly committed. As such, criminal or civil liability would not attach to the defendant.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 255, 253(d), 256 of the Tax Code:**  Defines penalties for failure to file returns, pay taxes, and the liability of responsible corporate officers.
*   **Sections 6, 10, and 13 of the Tax Code:** Requires a Letter of Authority (LOA) for BIR examination of taxpayers.
*   Obligation to pay assessed taxes despite acquittal in criminal case.
*   Obligation of corporate officers to actively participate in wrongful acts for criminal liability to attach.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Despite the outcome, E & D could have been held liable for deficiency taxes** if the assessment had been valid (i.e., a valid LOA existed).
*   **Corporate officers may be held criminally liable** for acts of the corporation *if* they actively participated in the wrongful act or had the power to prevent it.
