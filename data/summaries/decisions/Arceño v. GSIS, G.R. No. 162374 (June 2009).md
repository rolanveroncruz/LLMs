## Legal Document Summary - Arceño v. GSIS (G.R. No. 162374)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' denial of petitioner's claim for disability benefits from the GSIS.

**Facts:** Rodolfo Arceño, a former government prosecutor, sought disability benefits from the GSIS under Presidential Decree No. 626, as amended. Initially, his claim was based on adrenal adenoma, allegedly caused by work-related stress. The GSIS and subsequently the Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC) denied the claim, arguing the ailment was non-compensable. Only on appeal to the CA did Arceño raise the argument that his cardiovascular disease, also a contributing factor, was compensable under Annex "A" of the Implementing Regulations on Occupational Diseases.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Compensability of Illness:** Whether Arceño's disability claim should be approved based on cardiovascular disease, considering his initial claim focused on adrenal adenoma.
*   **Admissibility of New Arguments on Appeal:** Whether the CA erred in not addressing the cardiovascular disease argument when it was raised for the first time on appeal.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The case highlights the claimant's burden to establish a reasonable nexus between the ailment and the employment conditions.

**Obligations:** The GSIS has the obligation to provide compensation for work-related disabilities as defined under PD 626. Employees have the obligation to prove that their illness is work-related.

**Liabilities:** If the claim were successful, the GSIS would be liable for disability benefits as per PD 626.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Waiver:** The Supreme Court found that Arceño waived his right to claim compensation for cardiovascular disease by not raising it before the GSIS and the ECC. *Suzuki v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 146979* is cited to support the waiver argument.
*   **Precedent:** The ruling reinforces the principle that new issues cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. *Tan v. Commission on Elections, G.R. Nos. 166143-47* establishes this principle.
*   **Strain on Workmen's Trust Fund:** The Court expressed concern about protecting the Workmen's Trust Fund from non-work-related claims.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 626 (Employees Compensation Law):** The core statute governing disability compensation claims.
*   **Annex "A" of the Implementing Regulations on Occupational Diseases:** Lists compensable occupational diseases, which Arceño argued included his cardiovascular disease.
*   **Tan v. Commission on Elections, G.R. Nos. 166143-47, November 20, 2006, 507 SCRA 352:** Establishes the rule against raising new issues on appeal.
*   **Suzuki v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 146979, July 27, 2006, 496 SCRA 651:**  Supports the argument that failure to raise an issue before the lower administrative bodies results in a waiver of that issue.
*   **Government Service Insurance System v. Cuntapay, G.R. No. 168862, April 30, 2008, 553 SCRA 520:** Emphasizes judicial restraint in interfering with quasi-judicial agencies' findings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly mentioned but the case hinges on the interpretation of PD 626, particularly whether the cardiovascular condition was work related and thus compensable under that law, even though it was not the original basis of the claim.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's decision. The primary basis for the denial was Arceño's failure to raise the issue of cardiovascular disease compensation during the initial administrative proceedings. The decision emphasizes procedural regularity and adherence to established legal principles, specifically regarding the introduction of new issues on appeal and the evidentiary burden on the claimant.
