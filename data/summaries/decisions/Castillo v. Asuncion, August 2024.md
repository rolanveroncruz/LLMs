**Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-23-039 (Formerly JIB FPI No. 21-075-RTJ)**

**Case:** *Rolly C. Castillo vs. Hon. Miguel S. Asuncion*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Asuncion for Dishonesty and Gross Inefficiency stemming from a protracted delay in resolving a motion for a writ of preliminary injunction (WPI) in Civil Case No. 15-10803.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Underlying Civil Case:** Castillo, et al. (plaintiffs) sued Princeville Construction (defendants) for damages, seeking a WPI.
*   **Delay:**  Judge Asuncion delayed resolving the WPI motion for almost seven years after it was submitted for resolution.
*   **Constitutional Mandate:** Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution requires lower courts to resolve cases within three months.
*   **OCA Circular 243-2022 and Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Require timely resolution of pending incidents.
*   **Judge's Justification:** Judge Asuncion cited his designation as Executive Judge, COVID-19 related duties, and other pressing matters as reasons for the delay. This was rejected because the matter was submitted for resolution long before the pandemic.
*   **Prior Administrative Liability:** The Court notes that Judge Asuncion had previously been reprimanded in *Pelaez v. Hon. Asuncion* for undue delay, with a warning of more severe penalties for repetition.
*   **Allegation of Dishonesty:** Castillo accused Judge Asuncion of Dishonesty by certifying he had no pending matters to resolve in order to receive his salary. However, the Court did not give credence to it due to lack of evidence.

**Findings and Penalties:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty:** The Court found Judge Asuncion guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty under Rule 140, Section 14(d) of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC. The Supreme Court defined Gross Neglect of Duty "characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but [willfully] and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected."
*   **Penalty:** A Fine of PHP 201,000.00. This was increased from the JIB's recommendation of PHP 400,000.00 due to a prior administrative reprimand.
*   **Stern Warning:** Judge Asuncion was sternly warned against repeating similar acts.

**Dissenting Point:**
* Justice Caguioa concurred that Judge Asuncion should only be held GUILTY of Gross Neglect of Duty, and emphasized that not every offense under Rule 140 ipso facto merits a similar disciplinary action against a respondent as a member of the Bar.

**Key Legal Issues and Considerations:**

*   **Timeliness of Resolution:** Failure to comply with constitutional and procedural deadlines for resolving cases can lead to administrative liability. See Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution.
*   **Judicial Efficiency:** Judges are expected to manage their workload efficiently and prioritize cases appropriately.
*   **Gross Neglect of Duty Standard:** "Want of even slight care" in performing duties. See *Re: Darwin A. Reci, 805 Phil. 290, 292 (2017)*
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Prior administrative offenses can increase penalties. Rule 140, Section 19(2)(a) of the Rules of Court
*   **Dishonesty: **There was no finding of guilt for the charge of Dishonesty

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of 'Gross Neglect':** The determination of what constitutes "gross neglect of duty" may be subjective and fact-dependent.
*   **Cumulative effect of infractions:** As demonstrated by the increased penalty, multiple administrative offenses increase the risk of more severe sanctions.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Dishonesty:** In some cases, there could be a lack of evidence to fully establish the offense of Dishonesty.
