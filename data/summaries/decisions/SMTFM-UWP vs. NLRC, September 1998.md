## Legal Document Summary: *Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing vs. NLRC*

**Case:** *Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing United Workers of the Philippines (SMTFM-UWP) vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Hon. Jose G. De Vera and Top Form Manufacturing Phil., Inc.* G.R. No. 113856, September 07, 1998.

**Issue:** Whether Top Form Manufacturing committed unfair labor practice by bargaining in bad faith and discriminating against employees by refusing to grant across-the-board wage increases mandated by Wage Orders Nos. 01 & 02 (RTWPB-NCR).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Wage Orders:** Wage Order No. 01 granted a P17.00/day increase; Wage Order No. 02 granted a P12.00/day increase.
*   **CBA Negotiations:** Union proposed government-mandated wage increases be implemented across-the-board. Management allegedly "promised" this, but the provision was *not* included in the final CBA. Union allegedly "deferred" the provision, relying on management's promise.
*   **Implementation:** Top Form implemented scaled increases based on existing salary to "avoid wage distortion," granting full increases only to those earning below certain thresholds (P125/day and P140/day for Wage Orders 1 & 2, respectively).
*   **Union's Claim:** Top Form's refusal to implement across-the-board increases constituted bargaining in bad faith (Art. 247, Labor Code) and violated Article 100 (prohibition against diminution of benefits) and CBA Sec. 5 Article VII, referencing compliance with labor laws, rules, and regulations.
*   **Employer's Defense:**  Implemented increases to avoid wage distortion; No agreement for across-the-board increases in CBA; CBA has a zipper clause; Union's claim was only raised after a reasonable length of time from the implementation of the wage orders.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's obligation to bargain in good faith** (Art. 252, Labor Code - duty to execute a contract incorporating agreed upon terms if requested by either party, but does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make any concession.)
*   **Alleged contractual commitment based on "undertaking/promise" during negotiations.** Issue centers on whether oral promises made during CBA negotiations, but not incorporated into the final CBA, are enforceable.
*   **Compliance with Wage Orders.** Issue centers on whether the employer's chosen implementation method complied with the law, or resulted in unfair labor practices.
*   **Potential liability for unfair labor practice (Art. 247 Labor Code), damages (actual, moral, exemplary), and attorney's fees.**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** Whether evidence of the oral promise is admissible given the integration clause in the CBA.
*   **"Wage Distortion":** Whether Top Form's implementation actually prevented wage distortion, and whether a formal arbitral proceeding to determine if wage distortion exist is necessary. Existence of wage distortion is a question of fact for quasi-judicial tribunals (e.g. NLRC)
*   **"Bargaining in Bad Faith":**  Assessment of the totality of the circumstances to determine if Top Form genuinely intended to reach an agreement. The key point is that bad faith cannot be inferred from insistence on a bargaining position to the point of stalemate.
*   **"Zipper Clause":** The impact of the clause in precluding the obligation to bargain on subjects not covered by the agreement during its lifetime.
*   **Company Practice":** Whether past instances of across-the-board increases created a binding company practice.
*   **Section 5, Article VII of CBA and Art. 100 of Labor Code**: Court needed to assess whether the employer was indeed withdrawing or diminishing benefits previously enjoyed by employees.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Arts. 100, 247, 252:**  Key provisions regarding unfair labor practices, duty to bargain collectively, and prohibition against diminution of benefits.
*   **RA 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act):** Referenced concerning the prior across-the-board increase.
*   **Kiok Loy v. NLRC (G.R. No. 54334, January 22, 1986):** Cited by the petitioner, but distinguished by the Court because the employer in that case refused to negotiate.
*   **Marcopper Mining Corporation v. NLRC, 325 Phil. 618, 632 (1996):** On CBA provisions serving as the law between contracting parties.
*   **Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 102636, September 10, 1993, 226 SCRA 268:** On the determination of wage distortion as a question of fact within the jurisdiction of the NLRC.
*   **Divine Word University of Tacloban v. Secretary of Labor and Employment, G.R. No. 91915, September 11, 1992, 213 SCRA 759, 773:** On reasonable effort at good faith bargaining.
*   **Article 1700 of the Civil Code:** States that relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual.

**Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the petition, upholding the NLRC's decision. It found that Top Form did not commit unfair labor practice or violate the Labor Code. The alleged promise was not enforceable as it was not incorporated into the CBA, and Top Form implemented the wage orders in accordance with the law to avoid wage distortion. Court affirms that bad faith cannot be inferred from a party's insistence on the inclusion of a particular substantive provision, and in determining the issue of wage distortion, factual findings of administrative agencies are accorded respect and even finality in the court if supported by substantial evidence.
