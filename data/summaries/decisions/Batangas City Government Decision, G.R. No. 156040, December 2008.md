## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 156040

**Case:** City Government of Batangas v. Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Digitel)

**Issue:**  Whether Digitel is exempt from real property tax (RPT) on properties used in its telecommunications business under Section 5 of RA 7678, specifically the interpretation of "exclusive of this franchise."

**Holding:** Digitel is **NOT** exempt from RPT. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the RTC Branch 3's decision and affirmed RTC Branch 8's ruling that Digitel is liable for RPT.

**Key Provisions of RA 7678 (Digitel's Franchise):**

*   **Section 5 (Tax Provisions):**
    *   "The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of this franchise as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay."  This is the focal point of the dispute.
    *   Franchise tax based on gross receipts.
    *   Income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code.

**Interpretation of "Exclusive of this Franchise":**

*   The SC interprets this phrase to mean that **Digitel's franchise itself (as intangible personal property) is excluded from the properties subject to the "same taxes" imposed in the first part of Section 5.** It does **not** exempt real property used in the telecommunications business.
*   This clause ensures parity between franchisees and non-franchisees concerning taxes on real and personal property. Since non-franchisees do not have franchises, excluding the franchise from taxable property maintains this parity.
*   The *gross receipts* from the franchise are, however, subject to franchise tax under the subsequent clause.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Digitel is liable for RPT on real estate, buildings, and personal property (excluding the franchise itself) just like any other corporation.
*   Digitel is liable for franchise tax on gross receipts.
*   Digitel is liable for income tax under the NIRC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial:** Continued liability for RPT, including potential penalties and interest on past due amounts.
*   **Operational:** Possible disruptions if failure to pay RPT leads to enforcement actions by the City Government.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7678:**  Digitel's legislative franchise.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):**  Governs income tax and other taxes.
*   **Local Government Code (LGC):**  Imposes RPT (superseding earlier exemptions).
*   ***City Government of Quezon City v. Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.*:**  SC decision cited by Digitel, but effectively overruled by the current ruling. Court held that Digitel's real properties used in connection with their franchise were exempt from real property tax.
*   ***Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Digitel) v. Province of Pangasinan*:** Also overruled by the current ruling. Digitel had attempted to cite this case to defend their claimed exemption from real property tax.
*   ***Radio Communications of the Philippines, Inc. (RCPI) v. Provincial Assessor of South Cotabato*:**  Supports the principle that telecommunications companies with legislative franchises are liable for RPT, emphasizing strict construction against tax exemptions.
*   ***PLDT v. City of Davao*:**  Reiterates that tax exemptions must be based on clear and unequivocal statutory provisions.
*   **Numerous franchise laws (RA Nos. 4137, 5692, etc.):**  Demonstrate historical usage of "exclusive of this franchise" as excluding the franchise itself from property taxes, not granting RPT exemption.
*   **BLGF Opinions:** The SC notes that previous BLGF opinions supporting Digitel's position have been reversed.  Furthermore, the BLGF lacks authority to rule on RPT exemptions.
*   **Republic Act No. 9180 (RA 9180):** The franchise of Digitel Mobile, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Digitel. It states that Digitel Mobile is subject to "all taxes, duties, fees or charges and other impositions under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and other applicable laws."

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "exclusive of this franchise" in Section 5 of RA 7678. Digitel argued for an interpretation that exempted its real properties. This interpretation was rejected by the Court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision clarifies that Digitel is not exempt from real property tax. The phrase "exclusive of this franchise" does not create an exemption but merely clarifies that the franchise itself is not subject to the property taxes specified in the first sentence of Section 5 of RA 7678.  The SCâ€™s decision stresses the principle that tax exemptions must be explicitly granted and strictly construed against the taxpayer.
