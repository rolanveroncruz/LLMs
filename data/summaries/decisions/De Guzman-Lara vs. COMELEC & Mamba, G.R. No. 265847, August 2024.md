**Case:** *Ma. Zarah Rose De Guzman-Lara vs. Commission on Elections and Manuel N. Mamba* (G.R. No. 265847, August 6, 2024)

**Summary:**

This is a petition for certiorari challenging the COMELEC En Banc's dismissal of a disqualification petition filed by Lara against Mamba, who ran against each other for Governor of Cagayan in 2022. Lara alleged Mamba violated Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) due to massive vote-buying and unlawful disbursement of public funds during the campaign period. The COMELEC Second Division initially granted the petition based on a violation of Section 261(v) of the OEC (prohibited disbursement of public funds within 45 days before the election), despite finding insufficient evidence for Section 68 violation. The COMELEC En Banc reversed, dismissing the petition for being filed out of time and as the wrong remedy because it was filed after Mamba's proclamation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 68, Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Disqualification for vote-buying, terrorism, excessive spending, prohibited contributions, and violations of specific sections of the OEC (including 261(v)). *Silent on specific timeframe for filing disqualification petitions under this section*.
*   **Section 261(v), OEC:** Prohibits the release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds by public officials during the 45 days before a regular election.
*   **Rule 25, Sections 1 & 3, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Governs disqualification of candidates. Specifies that disqualification petitions must be filed "any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy but not later than the date of proclamation."
*   **Section 5, Rule 2, COMELEC Resolution No. 10673:** Concerns electronic filing, stating emails received after 5:00 PM are considered filed at 8:00 AM the next working day.
*   **Article IX-C, Section 2(2), Constitution:** Grants COMELEC exclusive original jurisdiction over contests relating to the elections and qualifications of elective provincial officials.
*   **Article 13, Civil Code:** Defines "days" as 24 hours.
*   **Section 6, Republic Act No. 6646:** Outlines the effect of a disqualification case.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Mamba:**  Potentially disqualified from holding the office of Governor if found to have violated Sections 68 or 261(v) of the OEC. Subject to a preliminary investigation for potential election offenses.
*   **COMELEC:** Duty to resolve disqualification petitions filed within the prescribed period, mandated by Republic Act No. 6646.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Incorrect Application of COMELEC Rules:** The COMELEC En Banc arguably misapplied its own rules on electronic filing by rigidly interpreting the deadline and failing to consider the public interest in election cases.
*   **Ousting Jurisdiction:** The COMELEC cannot use its own rules to divest itself of jurisdiction granted by the Constitution.
*   **Mamba's continued service if found to have violated electoral laws.**

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Uy v. COMELEC (G.R. Nos. 260650 & 260952, August 8, 2023):** Stressed the need for liberal application of rules in election cases.
*   **Panlilio v. COMELEC, 610 Phil. 551, 567 (2009):**  Definition of grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Bagatsing v. COMELEC, 378 Phil. 585 (1999)** and **Albana v. COMELEC, 478 Phil. 941 (2004):** Cited by COMELEC En Banc to support dismissal of disqualification petitions filed after elections.
*   **Venezuela v. COMELEC, 187 Phil. 503 (1980):**  Distinguishes between pre-proclamation and post-proclamation remedies.
*   **Aguinaldo v. COMELEC, 190 Phil. 1 (1981):**  Reiterates Venezuela, stating that timely filed petitions for disqualification should be resolved on the merits.
*   **Sunga v. COMELEC, 351 Phil. 310 (1998):** Highlights COMELEC's duty to resolve disqualification petitions timely filed and holds that dismissing the petition for disqualification would unduly reward erring candidates.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Not later than the date of proclamation" (Rule 25, COMELEC Rules of Procedure):** The meaning of the deadline, the Supreme Court holds that the phrase includes the entire 24 hour period and is not limited to the specific time of proclamation.
*   **Application of Section 5, COMELEC Resolution No. 10673:** Whether the rule regarding electronic filing deadlines (5:00 PM cutoff) should be strictly applied in the context of disqualification petitions, given the possibility of late-night proclamations.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition for certiorari, annulled the COMELEC En Banc's resolution, and remanded the case for proper disposition of Lara's disqualification petition against Mamba.
