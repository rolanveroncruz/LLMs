**Legal Document Summary: *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 121833, 130752, 137801)**

**Overview:**

These consolidated petitions revolve around Aboitiz Shipping Corporation's (Aboitiz) liability for cargo losses resulting from the sinking of M/V P. Aboitiz on October 31, 1980.  The central legal issue is whether Aboitiz can invoke the real and hypothecary doctrine (limited liability rule) to limit its liability to the value of the vessel and pending freightage, or whether the established negligence of Aboitiz and/or its crew removes the case from the scope of that doctrine. The document references prior related cases including: *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd.* (G.R. No. 100446, 21 January 1993) (“1993 GAFLAC case”) and *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 89757, 6 August 1990) (“1990 GAFLAC case”), *Monarch Ins. Co., Inc v. Court of Appeals*, *Allied Guarantee Insurance Company v. Court of Appeals* and *Equitable Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, and *Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. New India Assurance Company, Ltd.* (G.R. No. 156978, 02 May 2006).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real and Hypothecary Doctrine (Limited Liability):**  The primary principle at stake is whether Aboitiz can limit its liability to the value of the vessel, its appurtenances, and pending freightage, as provided under Articles 587, 590, and 837 of the Code of Commerce.
*   **Exceptions to Limited Liability:**  The critical exception is that the limited liability rule *does not* apply if the loss or damage was due to the fault or negligence of the shipowner or captain.
*   **Duty of Extraordinary Diligence:** A carrier has a duty of extraordinary diligence in the transport of goods.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Full Liability for Cargo Loss:**  Aboitiz faces full liability for the value of lost cargoes if negligence on their part (or the crew's) is established.  The trial courts found Aboitiz or its crew negligent in all three cases.
*   **Subrogation Claims by Insurers:** Insurers (Malayan Insurance, Asia Traders, Allied Guarantee Insurance, Equitable Insurance) have filed subrogation claims to recover amounts they paid out under marine cargo policies.
*   **Previous Conflicting Rulings:** The document highlights some prior cases that conflict, creating ambiguity.  The document clarifies that a concurrent pronouncement in *Monarch Insurance* was not an abandonment of the doctrine of limited liability.
*   **Risk of Execution:** Aboitiz faces the risk of immediate execution of judgments against it.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Commerce, Articles 587, 590, 837:**  Codifies the real and hypothecary doctrine in Philippine law.
*   ***Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd.* (1993 GAFLAC case):** Initially favored Aboitiz by applying the limited liability rule due to the perceived absence of a finding of negligence.  However, the present decision distinguishes it, noting express findings of negligence in these cases.
*   ***Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (1990 GAFLAC case):** Affirmed appellate court's finding that the sinking was due to negligence of officers and crew.
*   ***Aboitiz Shipping Corporation v. New India Assurance Company, Ltd.* (2006):** Reinforced the exception to limited liability when damage is due to the shipowner's fault or concurrent negligence with the captain.
*   **Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, Section 4(5):** Refers to the limitation of liability per package, but the declared value in the bill of lading can be prima facie evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Actual Negligence":** The interpretation of "actual negligence" of the shipowner is a key point. Was the negligence direct and causal to the sinking of the ship?
*   **Law of the Case:** The Respondents previously asserted that because the Court had already affirmed in toto the appellate court's finding that the vessel was not seaworthy and that Aboitiz failed to exercise extraordinary diligence in the handling of the cargoes, the law of the case prevents Aboitiz from invoking the real and hypothecary doctrine.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court DENIED Aboitiz's petitions, AFFIRMING the Court of Appeals' decisions. The Court held that the real and hypothecary doctrine does not apply because of the established negligence of Aboitiz and its crew in ensuring the seaworthiness of the vessel.  The Court emphasized that the exception to the limited liability rule applies where fault is attributable to the shipowner. This effectively makes Aboitiz fully liable for the value of the lost cargoes.
