**Case:** *Gilbert Zalameda v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 183656, September 04, 2009 (614 Phil. 710)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Gilbert Zalameda for violations of Sections 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) and 12 (possession of drug paraphernalia) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The conviction stemmed from a warrantless arrest and subsequent search where police officers found 0.03 grams of *shabu* and various drug paraphernalia in Zalameda's possession after receiving a tip about an ongoing "pot session."

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 11, R.A. 9165:** Prohibits unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 12, R.A. 9165:** Prohibits unauthorized possession of drug paraphernalia.
*   **Section 5, Rule 113, Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Defines lawful warrantless arrests, specifically *in flagrante delicto* arrests (when a crime is committed in the presence of an officer).
*   **Section 13, Rule 126, Rules of Court:** Allows search incident to lawful arrest.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Requires the preservation of integrity and evidentiary value of seized items.
*   **Plain View Doctrine:** Permits seizure of evidence in plain view during a lawful intrusion.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Section 11, R.A. 9165:** Indeterminate imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 14 years (affirmed).
*   **Violation of Section 12, R.A. 9165:** Indeterminate imprisonment of 6 months and 1 day (modified from 4 months and 1 day by the Supreme Court) to 2 years and 7 months.
*   Payment of fines (P300,000 for Section 11 and P10,000 for Section 12).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Zalameda argued the arrest was illegal, rendering seized evidence inadmissible. The Court found the arrest lawful under the *in flagrante delicto* exception.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Zalameda challenged the chain of custody of the seized items. The Court found substantial compliance by the police, preserving the integrity of the evidence.  Key evidence: *shabu* found on the person and paraphernalia in plain view.
*   **Informant:** Argument that the informant was never presented in court. Court noted that informant testimony is not necessary.
*   **Compliance with Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165**
*   **Extortion:** Zalameda claimed police officers attempted extortion, but failed to provide supporting evidence. The burden of proof lies with the accused to substantiate this claim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 11 & 12:** Statutory basis for the charges and penalties.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 113, Section 5:**  Defines lawful warrantless arrests (*in flagrante delicto*). *People v. Laguio, Jr.* G.R. No. 128587, March 16, 2007, 518 SCRA 393.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 126, Section 13:** Search incident to lawful arrest.

*   **Admissibility:** Section 3 of Rule 128 of the Rules of Court,
*   **Official Records:** Section 44, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court provides that entries in official records made in the performance of his duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specifically enjoined by law, are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated
*   **Extortion:**  *People v. Boco, G.R. No. 129676, June 23, 1999, 309 SCRA 42.*
*   **Informant:** *People v. Lopez, G.R. No. 172369, March 7, 2007, 517 SCRA 749; Dimacuha v. People, G.R. No. 143705, February 23, 2007, 516 SCRA 513.*
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** *People v. del Monte, G.R. No. 179940, April 23, 2008, 662 SCRA 627*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Substantial Compliance" with Chain of Custody:**  While the Court found "substantial compliance," the precise definition and application of this standard can be fact-specific and subject to debate.
*   **Evaluation of Credibility:** Credibility of the officer is crucial in upholding *in flagrante delicto.*.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the convictions based on the validity of the warrantless arrest, the legality of the search incident to that arrest, and the admissibility of the evidence seized. The Court gave weight to the testimony of the police officers and rejected Zalameda's defenses of denial and extortion due to lack of supporting evidence. Key issues for future cases would involve precise compliance with chain-of-custody procedures and more convincing evidence relating to claims of extortion.
