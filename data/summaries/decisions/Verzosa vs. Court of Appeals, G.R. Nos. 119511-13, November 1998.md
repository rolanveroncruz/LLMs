## Legal Document Summary: Verzosa vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 119511-13, November 24, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to set aside the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing a petition for certiorari questioning the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order granting a preliminary injunction.

**Key Issue:** What constitutes the *status quo ante* in the application of an injunctive writ when a complaint is amended?

**Facts:**

*   Fe Giron Uson (Private Respondent) owned land mortgaged to Wilfredo Verzosa (Petitioner).
*   Uson allegedly defaulted, leading Verzosa to initiate foreclosure.
*   Uson filed a complaint to annul the mortgage, seeking a preliminary injunction.
*   The original complaint was dismissed for lack of proper verification but was later reconsidered. An amended verified complaint was filed.
*   Verzosa proceeded with the foreclosure sale and bought the property.
*   Sheriff's Certificate of Sale was issued and registered. The redemption period expired.
*   Verzosa sold the land to Pilar Martinez (Petitioner).
*   Uson filed a second amended complaint impleading Martinez and the Register of Deeds, seeking annulment of Martinez's title.
*   RTC granted a preliminary injunction, ordering Verzosa and Martinez to cease and desist from acts of possession or ownership on the land. This was upheld by the CA.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition and affirmed the CA's decision.
*   The Court held that the *status quo ante* that the injunction sought to preserve was the situation *prior* to the controversy, specifically when Uson was the registered owner and possessor of the property.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Preliminary Injunction:** Granted to Uson, preventing Verzosa and Martinez from exercising ownership or possession over the property pending the resolution of the case.
*   **Status Quo Ante:** The status quo is defined as the situation preceding the controversy, which is when Uson owned and possessed the property. This freezes the situation and essentially nullifies Verzosa and Martinez's subsequent actions.
*   **Uson's Obligation:** Uson had to post a bond of P10,000.00 to secure the injunction.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Verzosa & Martinez:** They face the risk of having their ownership and possession declared invalid if Uson prevails in the main case for annulment of the mortgage and subsequent transactions.  They may be liable for damages.
*   **Ambiguity:** The scope of the injunction may be subject to further interpretation, particularly regarding what constitutes "acts of possession or ownership."
*   **Consignment:** Uson's initial willingness to consign the disputed amount to the court could be a factor against her if she is later found to have acted in bad faith.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Requisites for Preliminary Injunction:** The SC reiterated the requirements for granting a preliminary injunction, as established in cases like *Phil. Virginia Tobacco Administration v. De los Angeles*.
*   **Definition of Status Quo:** The Court defined the term status quo based on precedents like *Unciano Paramedical College v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Amendment of Pleadings:** The SC distinguished *Ruymann v. Director of Lands* and clarified that an amended complaint does not necessarily relate back to the date of the original filing if it introduces a new cause of action. Here, it did not.
*   **Consummated Acts:** The SC distinguished *Reyes v. Harty*, stating that while injunctions generally don't restrain consummated acts, if acts are performed *after* an injunction suit is filed, the defendant acts at their peril.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the court found the injunction proper, it's enforceability might be challenged, specifically if Martinez was indeed in physical possession before the granting of the second injunction.
*   The extent of the Court's power to 'compel restoration' may be challenged on the basis of it being a mandatory injunction.

**Overall Assessment:**

The ruling strongly favors Uson. The court effectively "froze" the situation at a point when she still owned the property. Verzosa and Martinez acted at their own risk by proceeding with the foreclosure and subsequent sale while litigation was pending. The interpretation of *status quo ante* is crucial, and the SC has firmly defined it as the state before the original controversy began. The key risk for Verzosa and Martinez is the potential loss of the property and liability for damages. Uson faces the risk of a reversed ruling should the primary complaint fail.
