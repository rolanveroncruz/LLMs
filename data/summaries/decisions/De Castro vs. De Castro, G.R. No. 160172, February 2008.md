**Case Summary: *De Castro v. Assidao-De Castro*, G.R. No. 160172 (Feb. 13, 2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision concerning support, legitimacy, and the validity of a marriage.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Marriage:** The parties married on March 13, 1995, after executing a false affidavit in lieu of a marriage license, claiming to have lived together for five years. They did not cohabitate after the ceremony.
*   **Child:** A child, Reianna Tricia A. De Castro, was born to the respondent on November 13, 1995.
*   **Action for Support:** Respondent filed a complaint for support against petitioner, alleging marriage and paternity.
*   **Petitioner's Defense:** Petitioner denied the validity of the marriage and paternity, claiming the affidavit was fraudulent, he was pressured into marriage due to the respondent's pregnancy, lack of parental consent, and that they never lived as husband and wife. He also refused to undergo DNA testing.
*   **Lower Court Ruling:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) initially ruled the marriage invalid for lack of a license but ordered petitioner to support the child as the natural father.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the support order, declared the child legitimate, and held the marriage valid until nullified by a competent court in a separate action. The CA emphasized that it frowned upon petitioner's refusal to undergo DNA testing.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation to Support:** The primary issue is the petitioner's obligation to provide financial support to the child.
*   **Potential Liability for Child Support Arrears:**  If paternity is established, the petitioner could be liable for past and ongoing child support payments.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Determination of Paternity:** The main risk for the petitioner is the determination of paternity. His refusal to undergo DNA testing and admission of being the legitimate father in an affidavit has severely weakened his defense.
*   **Ongoing Support Obligations:** The petitioner faces potential ongoing and significant child support payments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Marriage:** The core contention revolves around the validity of the marriage. The affidavit used in lieu of a marriage license was demonstrably false.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code Articles 4, 34, 172, 175:** Addresses marriage requisites, exemptions from marriage license requirements, and proof of filiation. Article 4: "The absence of any of the essential or formal requisites shall render the marriage void ab initio".
*   **Niñal v. Bayadog, 384 Phil. 661 (2000):** Affirms that the validity of a void marriage can be collaterally attacked in proceedings other than a direct action for annulment/declaration of nullity, especially when essential to the determination of the case, but final judgment is required for the purpose of remarriage. Addresses the issue of whether a void marriage must be the subject of a direct attack.
*   **Nicdao Cariño v. Yee Cariño, 403 Phil. 861 (2001):**  Reinforces the principle from *Niñal* that courts can rule on the validity of a marriage even in a case not directly challenging it.

**Legal Analysis:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Marriage:** The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals erred, and it allowed for the invalidity of the marriage to be determined in the action for support. It cited *Niñal v. Bayadog* and *Nicdao Cariño v. Yee Cariño* to support the permissibility of collateral attacks on void marriages when essential to resolving the primary issue.
*   **Void Ab Initio Marriage:** The Court found the marriage void ab initio due to the lack of a valid marriage license, which is a formal requirement for a valid marriage.
*   **Illegitimate Filiation:** Despite the invalid marriage, the court determined that the child was an illegitimate daughter of the petitioner based on the birth certificate, the affidavit, and his previous relationship with the respondent. The court also noted his evasiveness in his answers and refusal to undergo DNA testing.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and reinstated the Regional Trial Court's decision. The Court determined that the marriage between the petitioner and respondent was void due to the lack of a valid marriage license but that the child was an illegitimate daughter of the petitioner and, therefore, entitled to support.
