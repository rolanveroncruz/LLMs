Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision in *Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office vs. Hon. Maximo M. De Leon, Presiding Judge of the Makati City Regional Trial Court, Branch 143, and Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation*, G.R. Nos. 236577 and 236597, August 15, 2018, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Summary: PCSO v. De Leon and PGMC**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing the RTC's grant of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI) in favor of Philippine Gaming and Management Corporation (PGMC).

**Facts:**

*   The dispute originates from an Equipment Lease Agreement (ELA) between Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) and PGMC for online lottery equipment in Luzon. The original term was 8 years, subject to amendments extending the lease to 2015 and later to August 21, 2018 via a Supplemental and Status Quo Agreement.
*   The ELA was investigated by the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, leading PCSO to seek renegotiation of lease rates.
*   PGMC filed contempt cases (SCA Case Nos. 12-530 and 12-1011) after PCSO allowed another provider (Pacific Online) to supply equipment.  A WPI was initially issued by Judge Baybay in favor of PGMC.
*   An Interim Settlement was reached, stipulating arbitration under ICC rules to resolve the "exclusivity issue." The contempt cases were archived pending arbitration.
*   Despite the Interim Settlement, PGMC filed a new application for a TRO/WPI in 2017 to stop PCSO's bidding process for a *new* Nationwide On-line Lottery System (NOLS) after the expiration of their contract. Judge De Leon granted the WPI, prompting this Petition for Certiorari.
*   Crucially, the ICC arbitration panel ruled *against* PGMC's claim of exclusive rights to supply an online lottery system for Luzon. The RTC confirmed this Arbitral Award.

**Key Provisions & Agreements:**

*   **Equipment Lease Agreement (ELA):** The core contract, subject to multiple amendments. The key provision is Paragraph 3, as amended, outlining the term and potential extensions.
*   **Amendments to ELA:** Extended the lease term to August 22, 2015. Paragraph 3's upgrade requirement is relevant if future extensions are contemplated.
*   **Interim Settlement (2013):** Stipulated arbitration of the "exclusivity issue" under ICC rules. Important for establishing the scope of arbitrable issues.
*   **Supplemental and Status Quo Agreement (2015):** Extended the ELA term to August 21, 2018. It included dismissing pending judicial actions but continuing arbitration for territorial exclusivity. This agreement is *crucial* because the WPI was sought *after* this agreement's expiration.

**Legal Issues:**

*   Did Judge De Leon commit grave abuse of discretion in granting the WPI, effectively extending PGMC's contractual rights beyond the expiration of the Supplemental and Status Quo Agreement (August 21, 2018)?
*   Did the WPI improperly interfere with the jurisdiction of the arbitral panel?

**Holding:**

Yes. The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition for Certiorari. Judge De Leon committed grave abuse of discretion. PCSO is permitted to proceed with bidding for the NOLS.

**Reasoning:**

*   PGMC's claim for a WPI was based on an alleged exclusive right that did not exist *beyond* August 21, 2018. The bidding process was for a new NOLS system commencing *after* that date. PGMC failed to demonstrate a clear legal right (elemento existente) to be protected, as required under Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   The Court emphasized *Mabayo Farms, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 435 Phil. 112 (2002), and *Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) v. City Advertising Ventures Corporation*, G.R. No. 132944, November 9, 2016, regarding the requisites for a WPI (existing right, material invasion, irreparable injury). PGMC failed to meet these requisites.
*   The Final Award in the ICC arbitration, confirmed by the RTC, definitively ruled against PGMC's claim of exclusive rights, further undermining the basis for the WPI.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Judge De Leon:** Faced potential administrative liability for grave abuse of discretion, although not explicitly stated in the document.
*   **PGMC:** Faced payment of PCSO's arbitration costs (Php 53,592,202.09) and the costs of arbitration including the fees of the Arbitral Tribunal and the administrative fees of the [International Chamber of Commerce] US$ 850,000.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Basis for the Petition for Certiorari.
*   **Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Outlines the grounds for issuing a preliminary injunction.
*   **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Rules of Arbitration:** Governed the arbitration proceedings. Section 28(1) is relevant regarding interim measures and the ability to seek relief from judicial authorities.
*   ***Mabayo Farms, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 435 Phil. 112 (2002):** Key case law on the requirements for a preliminary injunction.
*   ***Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) v. City Advertising Ventures Corporation*, G.R. No. 132944, November 9, 2016:** Further reinforces the elements needed for a preliminary injunction.
*   **Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution:** Rule 5.5 regarding verified petitions for ADR.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The interpretation of "exclusivity issue":** PGMC argued for a broader interpretation, while PCSO sought a narrower one tied specifically to the ELA. The ICC arbitration and the Supreme Court sided with PCSO's interpretation.
*   **The continuing effect of the Interim Settlement *after* the Supplemental Agreement's expiration:** PGMC attempted to rely on the Interim Settlement to argue for ongoing rights, but the Court correctly focused on the expiration of the *Supplemental* Agreement as the controlling event.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   A preliminary injunction cannot be used to create rights where none exist.
*   Contractual rights are strictly interpreted, and extensions must be clearly established.
*   Arbitration agreements do not necessarily preclude all judicial intervention, but courts must be cautious not to interfere with the arbitrators' jurisdiction or pre-judge the merits of the underlying dispute.
*   An arbitral award, when confirmed by the court, is binding and determinative of the issues submitted to arbitration.

This summary focuses on the key legal arguments and findings. A deeper analysis would require reviewing the full ICC arbitration record and the pleadings filed in the various court cases.
