**Legal Document Summary: *Geroy v. Calderon*, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2092**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Dan R. Calderon for gross immorality stemming from an alleged extra-marital affair.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Complaint:** Eva Lucia Z. Geroy alleges an illicit affair with Judge Calderon from 2002-2005, including details of their relationship, financial assistance, and instances of alleged abuse.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Judge Calderon denies the affair, claiming Geroy fabricated the story to extort money. He admits a professional relationship where Geroy encoded case facts and ran errands, but denies a romantic involvement.
*   **Findings of Fact:** The Investigating Justice found substantial evidence of an illicit affair based on text messages, intimate knowledge disclosed by the complainant (skin tags), access to respondent's house, and assistance in weddings outside the scope of professional duties.
*   **Immorality Definition:** The Court reiterated the definition of immorality encompassing conduct inconsistent with rectitude, corruption, indecency, depravity, dissoluteness, or willful, flagrant, or shameless conduct showing moral indifference. *Madredijo v. Layao, Jr.* is cited (A.M. No. RTJ-98-1424).
*   **Penalty:** Judge Calderon was found guilty of immorality, warranting a suspension of six months without salary and other benefits, along with a stern warning.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Moral Obligations:** The decision emphasizes the high moral standards required of judges, both in their official and private conduct, citing *Tan v. Pacuribot*, A.M. No. RTJ-06-1982, and *Resngit-Marquez v. Llamas, Jr.*, A.M. No. RTJ-02-1708.
*   **Liability for Immorality:** Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC) dictates sanctions for immorality, including dismissal, suspension, or fine.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Mitigation:** The Investigating Justice considered Geroy's complicity in the affair as a mitigating factor. However, the Supreme Court clarified that Geroy's intentions do not negate the respondent's liability in violating the code of conduct for judges. The Court cited *Carman v. Zerrudo*, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1146, emphasizing that administrative proceedings are to protect public service not address the complainants emotions.
*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The case relies heavily on circumstantial evidence, text messages, and witness testimony. The weight given to each piece of evidence could be subject to scrutiny in future cases.
*   **Double Standard:** While Geroy's actions are criticized, the core liability remains with Judge Calderon's breach of judicial ethics and the prohibition against extra-marital relationships.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Defines and penalizes misconduct of judges, including immorality.
*   **A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC:** Amendment to Rule 140.
*   **Madredijo v. Layao, Jr., A.M. No. RTJ-98-1424:** Defines immorality in the context of judicial ethics.
*   **Tan v. Pacuribot, A.M. No. RTJ-06-1982, December 14, 2007:** High moral standards for judges.
*   **Resngit-Marquez v. Llamas, Jr., A.M. No. RTJ-02-1708:** Judges personal conduct must be beyond reproach.
*   **Carman v. Zerrudo, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1146:** Administrative proceedings are to protect public service.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262 (Violence Against Women and Their Children Act):** mentioned but ultimately not charged.

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the strict ethical standards imposed on members of the judiciary. While mitigating circumstances may be considered in determining the appropriate penalty, engaging in extra-marital affairs is a serious offense that can lead to disciplinary action.
