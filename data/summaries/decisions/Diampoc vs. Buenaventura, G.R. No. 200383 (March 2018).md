**Legal Document Summary: Diampoc v. Buenaventura, G.R. No. 200383**

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Date:** March 19, 2018

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Norma M. Diampoc
*   **Respondent:** Jessie Buenaventura and the Registry of Deeds for the City of Taguig

**Subject Matter:** Annulment of Deed of Sale and Recovery of Duplicate Original Copy of Title

**Background:**
The Diampocs (plaintiffs) sued Buenaventura (defendant) to annul a deed of sale transferring half of their property to Buenaventura. The Diampocs claimed Buenaventura fraudulently induced them to sign the deed under the guise of it being loan security, and they did not receive consideration. Buenaventura argued the sale was valid and consideration was paid.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals and RTC decisions, upholding the validity of the deed of sale. The Court ruled that even with potential defects in the notarization, the deed is still valid and enforceable between the parties.

*   **Defective Notarization:** The Court acknowledged the petitioner's arguments regarding irregularities in the notarization process (signing without reading, absence of notary, one CTC for both). However, it cited *Riosa v. Tabaco La Suerte Corporation, 720 Phil. 586, 602 (2013)* stating that the absence of notarization does not invalidate the transaction; it merely reduces the evidentiary value to that of a private document.
*   **Article 1358 of the Civil Code** Formalities required by this article is not essential for the validity of the contract but is simply for its greater efficacy or convenience, or to bind third persons, and is merely a coercive means granted to the contracting parties to enable them to reciprocally compel the observance of the prescribed form. *Chong v. Court of Appeals, 554 Phil 43, 61-62 (2007).*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Diampocs failed to present clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity attached to notarized documents, even with its reduced evidentiary value.
*   **Negligence:** The Court emphasizes that the Diampocs' negligence in signing the document without reading it, despite being literate, estops them from denying its contents, citing *Bernardo v. Court of Appeals, 387 Phil. 736, 748 (2000).*
*   **Binding Effect of Contracts:** The Court stated that it would not relieve the Diampocs from the effects of an unwise agreement.
*   **SC's limited jurisdiction:** The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited to reviewing errors of law, not to re-evaluating facts already determined by lower courts.

**Obligations:**

*   The Diampocs are obligated to uphold the terms of the deed of sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Diampocs are liable for the consequences of their negligence in signing the document without due diligence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Claim of Fraud:** The Diampocs could potentially pursue separate legal actions based on fraud, though the current decision makes this unlikely to succeed.
*   **Subsequent Transfers:** The respondent can now validly transfer ownership of the subject property.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1358**: Requirement of a public document for contracts involving real rights over immovable property.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1159**: Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Domingo versus Domingo, 455 SCRA 555*: Deed of Sale being a public document, it is prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein
*   *Rosario Textile Mills Corp. versus Home Bankers Savings, 462 SCRA 88*: terms of a contract are rendered conclusive upon the parties and evidence aliunde is not admissible to vary or contradict a complete and enforceable agreement embodied in a document.
