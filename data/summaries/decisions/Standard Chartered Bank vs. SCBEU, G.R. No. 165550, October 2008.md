Here's a legal summary of the *Standard Chartered Bank v. Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union* case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Standard Chartered Bank v. Standard Chartered Bank Employees Union* (G.R. No. 165550, October 8, 2008)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, First Division

**Facts:** This case concerns a dispute arising from a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) and its employees' union (SCBEU). After entering into a CBA providing for medical benefits (including maternity benefits), SCB changed its insurance provider from Philamlife to Maxicare. SCBEU then filed a ULP complaint alleging a gross violation of the economic provisions of the CBA, specifically the removal of outpatient medicine reimbursements and maternity benefits for spouses of male employees.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether spouses of male employees are entitled to maternity benefits under the CBA.
2.  Whether SCB employees are entitled to outpatient medicine reimbursements.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling in favor of the union on both issues.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **CBA, Article XI, Section 1:** Requires SCB to "continue to cover all its employees with a group hospitalization and major surgical insurance plan including maternity benefits."
*   **CBA, Schedule L:** Specifies benefits, including maternity benefits, and lists "Married staff and spouse and eligible children as defined in the plan" under coverage.
*   **Philamlife Group Policy No. P-1620:** The existing insurance plan at the time the CBA was signed. Defines "dependent" to include a member's spouse and provides that dependents enjoy the same benefits as the insured person unless expressly excluded.
*   **Standard Chartered Bank Employee Medical Insurance Plan (Booklet):** Published by SCB, explaining maternity benefits. States that the dependent of an insured employee can claim maternity benefits after continuous insurance for nine months.

**Liabilities/Findings:**

*   The Court found that SCB was obligated to provide maternity benefits to spouses of male employees based on a proper reading of the CBA, particularly Article XI, Section 1 and Schedule L, in conjunction with the existing Philamlife plan and the explanatory booklet. The Court emphasized that the CBA must be interpreted in favor of labor. The term "dependent" includes "a member's spouse who is not more than 65 years of age.
*   The Court upheld the DOLE's finding of an established company practice of reimbursing outpatient services, including medicine, even without an explicit provision in the insurance plan. This practice, consistently followed, was deemed a benefit that could not be unilaterally withdrawn by the employer.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 4 of the Labor Code:**  Construed as applying when interpreting the CBA, mandating interpretations in favor of labor when ambiguity exists.
*   **Articles 1370-1379 of the Civil Code:**  Cited by petitioner but deemed less applicable than the Labor Code's directive to resolve ambiguity in favor of labor.
*   **Article 100, Labor Code** Cited as it relates to the voluntary employer practice which cannot later on be unilaterally withdrawn by the employer under.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Dependents":** The insurance plan's definition of "dependent" and its application to specific benefits were crucial. While the plan covered spouses, there was a question of whether that coverage extended to *all* benefits.
*   **CBA Interpretation:** Disagreement over the intended scope of "maternity benefits" in the CBA, specifically whether it included spouses of male employees. SCB argued for a narrow interpretation, but the Court favored a broader, pro-labor reading.
*   **Outpatient Medicine Reimbursements:** The absence of an explicit CBA provision for outpatient medicine reimbursement, yet the DOLE's finding of an established company practice. This creates potential for future disputes if SCB attempts to modify or eliminate the practice.
*   **Future Renegotiation of the CBA:** The court noted that since the grant of maternity benefits to spouses of male employees of petitioner is premised on the CBA, the same may be the subject of future renegotiation.

**Legal Precision Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding SCB liable for maternity benefits to spouses of male employees and obligated to continue outpatient medicine reimbursements. The ruling hinged on interpreting the CBA (Article XI, Section 1 and Schedule L), the Philamlife Group Policy (defining "dependent"), and the SCB's explanatory booklet in favor of labor. The existence of a company practice, even without explicit contractual language, was critical in sustaining the outpatient medicine reimbursement. The factual findings of the DOLE were given deference.
