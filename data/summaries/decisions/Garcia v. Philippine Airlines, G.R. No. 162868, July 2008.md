**Case Summary: Garcia v. Philippine Airlines (PAL)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether Rodolfo Garcia was an employee of Philippine Airlines (PAL) or Stellar Industrial Services, Inc. (Stellar), and consequently, whether PAL is liable for his illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Employer Determination:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision that Garcia was an employee of Stellar, not PAL.
*   **Res Judicata:** This determination is barred from being relitigated due to the doctrine of *res judicata*, specifically the "conclusiveness of judgment" aspect. A prior case, *Stellar Employees Association v. PAL and Stellar*, had already determined that Stellar employees (including Garcia) were employees of Stellar and not PAL.
*   **Independent Contractor:** Stellar was deemed an independent contractor, not a labor-only contractor, based on its substantial capitalization, separate business operations, and the control it exercised over its employees.
*   **Control Test:** PAL did not exert sufficient control over Garcia's work to establish an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Termination Cause:** NLRC determined that Garcia was guilty of gross and habitual neglect and was terminated for cause and with due process.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Stellar's Sole Liability:** Stellar, as the direct employer, is solely liable for any pecuniary awards related to Garcia's dismissal (although the SC affirmed the finding of a valid dismissal).
*   **PAL's Absolution:** PAL is absolved from any liability for Garcia's dismissal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Res Judicata (Rule 39, Sections 47(b) & (c) of the Rules of Court):** Applied to prevent the relitigation of the employer-employee relationship issue.
*   **Definition of Independent Contractor (Neri v. NLRC, 224 SCRA 717):**  Cited regarding the requirement of either substantial capitalization or possession of tools and equipment.
*   **Control Test (Brotherhood Labor Unity Movement v. Zamora):** Used to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Findings:** The SC relied heavily on the factual findings of the CA and NLRC, which were supported by substantial evidence. However, the Labor Arbiter initially found in favor of Garcia, indicating a possible divergence in factual interpretation.
*   **Petitioner's Evidence:** The petitioner's failure to provide substantial evidence proving that his duties were necessary to the business of PAL and that PAL had control over the means and methods of his performance was a crucial point against his claims.
*   **Delay in Filing:**  The SC initially noted that the petition was filed outside the extended deadline. While they adjudicated on the merits, the delay could have led to a dismissal.
*   **Lack of solidary liability:** the potential of Stellar not being able to satisfy any monetary judgment.

**Ambiguities:**

*   **Level of Control:** A critical factor is the extent of control exercised by PAL over Garcia's work. While the SC found it insufficient, the Labor Arbiter's initial ruling suggests a possible argument that PAL's supervision was substantial enough to establish an employer-employee relationship.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case appears well-settled based on *res judicata* and the factual findings of the CA and NLRC. The key hurdle for the petitioner was overcoming the prior determination of his employment status and providing sufficient evidence to demonstrate PAL's control and the essential nature of his work to PAL's business.
