## Legal Document Summary: People v. Cabiles, G.R. No. 112035

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a Regional Trial Court decision finding Panfilo Cabiles guilty of Robbery with Rape under Art. 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code. The prosecution presented evidence that Cabiles robbed the house of Marites Nas Atienza and raped her housemaid, Luzviminda Aquino. Cabiles denied the charges and presented an alibi.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 294(2), Revised Penal Code:**  Defines Robbery with Rape and prescribes the penalty of *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Obligations:**  The accused is obligated to compensate the victims for their losses and injuries.  Specifically, the accused is obligated to pay consequential damages to Luzviminda Aquino and to return the stolen items or their monetary value to Marites Nas Atienza.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Found guilty of Robbery with Rape, subject to the penalty of *Reclusion Perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Liable for consequential damages (increased to P50,000), restitution of stolen items (or their value - Seiko Wristwatch (P1,500.00) and one gold ring (P500.00)) and reimbursement of cash (P1,000.00), and court costs.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Warrantless Arrest:** Accused claimed illegal warrantless arrest but failed to raise the issue *before* pleading, thus waiving the objection. (See *People v. Lopez, Jr.*, *People vs. Rivera*, *People vs. Manzano*, *People vs. Llenaresas*)
*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** Sworn statement obtained *without* counsel is inadmissible under *People vs. Deniega*, *People vs. Cascalla*, *People vs. Agustin*, *People vs. Cabintoy*.  Confession does not meet the requirements of voluntariness, assistance of counsel, express statement, and written format.
*   **Verbal Admission:**  Admissible because made spontaneously to Marites Nas Atienza, not during custodial investigation, following *People vs. Andan*.
*   **Identification:**  The court relied heavily on victim identification.  Accuracy may be challenged.
*   **Medico-Legal Evidence:**  Defense attempts to discredit rape charge based on doctor's findings of old hymenal lacerations were rejected, following *People vs. Delovino*, and *People vs. Soan*.
*   **Alibi:**  Defense of alibi was deemed weak and insufficient.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Stolen bracelet & watch, and shoestring used to tie up Luzviminda. Court uses this circumstantial evidence.
*   **Recent Possession Rule:** Court cited the evidentiary presumption that a person found in possession of thing taken in the doing of a recent wrongful act is the taker and the doer of the whole act (Sec. 3[7], Rule 131, Revised Rules of Evidence). Court also cites *People vs. Newman*.

**Overall Assessment:** The conviction rests heavily on the victims' testimony and the circumstantial evidence of the stolen items.  The inadmissibility of the written confession weakens the prosecution's case but is overcome by the admissibility of the verbal confession and the court's assessment of the prosecution witnesses' credibility. The defense raised procedural issues regarding the arrest but was ultimately unsuccessful. The risks revolve around the credibility of the victim's identification and the interpretation of the medico-legal evidence.
