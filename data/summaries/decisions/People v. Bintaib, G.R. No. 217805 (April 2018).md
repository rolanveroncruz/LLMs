## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bintaib* (G.R. No. 217805)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Alsarif Bintaib y Florencio a.k.a. "Leng"* (G.R. No. 217805, April 2, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the conviction of the accused for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal sale of shabu.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, R.A. No. 9165:** Penalizes the sale, delivery, giving away, transport, or distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 (Chain of Custody):**  Establishes the procedure for the handling of seized drugs, requiring:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photographing of the drugs after seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused, a representative from the media, DOJ, and an elected public official during the inventory.
    *   Submission of the drugs to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory within 24 hours for examination.
    *   Issuance of a forensic laboratory examination report within 24 hours of receipt.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused was initially found guilty by the RTC and CA of violating Section 5 of R.A. 9165 and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Violations:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the conviction due to significant breaches in the chain of custody, including:
    *   **Delayed Marking:**  Drugs were not marked immediately upon arrest, but later at the police station. (citing *People v. Ismael*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017) This delay creates reasonable doubt.
    *   **Insulating Witness Presence:**  The media, DOJ, and elected public official were present *only* during the signing of the inventory certificate, *not* during the actual inventory and photographing process.  This violates the mandatory requirements of Section 21. The Court emphasized that mere signature is insufficient.
    *   **Lack of Explanation for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to offer any justification for the non-compliance with the procedural requirements of Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 and failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody.

*   *People v. Ismael*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017

**Outcome:**

*   The SC reversed the CA decision and acquitted the accused, Alsarif Bintaib, due to the prosecution's failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, primarily stemming from the failure to properly establish the chain of custody of the seized drugs and the lack of explanation for the failure to comply with Section 21.

**Legal Advice Considerations:**

*   This case reinforces the strict interpretation and mandatory compliance with Section 21, R.A. 9165. Prosecutors must demonstrate meticulous adherence to chain of custody procedures and provide valid justifications for any deviations. Defense counsel should scrutinize the prosecution's evidence for potential breaches in the chain of custody to challenge the admissibility of the seized drugs. The presence of the insulating witnesses is not mere formality but part of the due process afforded to the accused.
