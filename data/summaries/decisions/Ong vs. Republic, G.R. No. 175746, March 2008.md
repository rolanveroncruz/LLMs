**Case Summary: *Charles L. Ong v. Republic of the Philippines***

**Citation:** 571 Phil. 588 (G.R. No. 175746, March 12, 2008)

**Legal Issue:** Whether Petitioner Charles L. Ong, et al. established registrable ownership over a parcel of land in Barangay Anolid, Mangaldan, Pangasinan, sufficient to warrant land registration under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' reversal of the Municipal Trial Court's (MTC) decision granting land registration.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Requires applicants to prove (1) that the land is alienable and disposable land of the public domain, and (2) open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership *since June 12, 1945, or earlier.*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The applicant bears the burden of proving the requisite possession and occupation.

**Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Failure to Prove Requisite Possession:** Ong et al. failed to prove possession and occupation since June 12, 1945, or earlier. The earliest tax declaration presented was dated 1971, far short of the required period.
*   **Insufficient Occupation:**  The court emphasized that "possession and occupation" are distinct requirements.  Mere possession, even with tax declarations, is insufficient.  Ong admitted that neither he nor his brothers actively occupied the land after purchasing it in 1998.  Prior owners also did not actively occupy the land.
*   **Chain of Ownership:**  The applicants traced ownership through a series of sales back to 1979.  This established *a* chain of ownership, but it did not satisfy the continuous possession requirement dating back to June 12, 1945.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141, Section 48(b) (as amended by Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1073):** The statutory provision that defines the requirements for acquiring private rights over public lands.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 14(1):** The Property Registration Decree and the requirements for land registration.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 892:** Relevant to period during which application must be filed.

**Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. Enciso, G.R. No. 160145, November 11, 2005, 474 SCRA 700, 711:** Cited regarding the requirements for land registration.
*   **Republic v. Alconaba, G.R. No. 155012, April 14, 2004, 427 SCRA 611:** Distinguishes between possession and occupation and emphasizes the need for actual possession and acts of dominion.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The key contentious issue is the interpretation and application of the "possession and occupation" requirement under Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529, particularly the need for continuous, open, and notorious possession *since June 12, 1945, or earlier.*
*   Tacking of possession: While tacking is permissible, applicants still need to sufficiently demonstrate the character and duration of possession by their predecessors-in-interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Difficulty in Proving Possession:** Demonstrating continuous, open, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, can be very difficult, especially where records are incomplete or unreliable.
*   **Government Opposition:** The Republic actively opposed the application, emphasizing the public interest in ensuring that land registration requirements are strictly met.
*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:** The differing decisions between the MTC and CA demonstrate the importance of fact-finding in land registration cases, and the weight given to CA decisions that contradict MTC rulings.
