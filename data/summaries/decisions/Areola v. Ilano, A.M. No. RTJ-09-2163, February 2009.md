**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-09-2163 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 07-2717-RTJ)**

**Case:** *Edgardo D. Areola (a.k.a. Mohammad Kahdaffy) v. Judge Bayani Y. Ilano*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Bayani Y. Ilano, RTC Branch 71, Antipolo City, stemming from alleged violations of RA 3019, the New Code of Judicial Conduct, gross incompetence, gross ignorance of the law, bias, partiality, unjustified absences, and habitual tardiness, specifically related to Criminal Case No. 94-11519 (Murder).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Complaint Dismissed in Part:** The Court found no basis for the charges of RA 3019 violations, gross incompetence, gross ignorance of the law, bias, and partiality.  The Court asserted that a judge's adjudicative acts are not subject to disciplinary action absent bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or deliberate intent to do injustice.
*   **Failure to Resolve Motion with Dispatch:**  Judge Ilano was found remiss in his duty for failure to resolve complainant's pending Motion for Reconsideration (regarding bail) with dispatch within the 90-day period prescribed by the Constitution and Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. This delay, coupled with the pending motion from 2002, constitutes a failure to administer justice without delay. *Abarquez v. Rebosura, A.M. No. MTJ-94-986, January 28, 1998, 285 SCRA 109.* is relevant here, referencing the 90 day rule.
*   **Failure to Comply with Court Orders:**  Judge Ilano failed to file his comments on the administrative complaint despite multiple notices, violating his duty to preserve the integrity of the judiciary.  This demonstrates a lack of professionalism and is considered gross misconduct and insubordination. *Chan v. Castillo, A.M. No. P-94-1055, November 25, 1994, 238 SCRA 359, 361; Martinez v. Zoleta, A.M. No. MTJ-94-904, May 22, 1996, 257 SCRA 49, 54.* support the characterization of such conduct.
*   **Judge's Death:**  Although Judge Ilano died during the pendency of the case, the Court retained jurisdiction to determine his guilt or innocence. *Zarate v. Romanillos, A.M. No. RTJ-94-1140, March 23, 1995, 242 SCRA 593, 605.* confirms the court's jurisdiction despite the death of the respondent judge.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty to resolve motions within the prescribed period (Constitution, Art. VIII, Sec. 15).
*   Duty to administer justice without delay (Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3, Rule 3.05).
*   Duty to comply with orders and resolutions of the Supreme Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative fine of P20,000.00 (deductible from retirement benefits).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith" Determination:** The reliance on the "good faith" standard when assessing a judge's judicial acts carries the risk of subjectivity. Proving "bad faith" can be difficult. While the standard is well-established *Pitney v. Judge Abrogar, 461 Phil. 28, 34 (2003).* , its application can be contentious.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The lack of the Judge's comment resulted in no mitigation being presented by the respondent regarding the delay in resolution.
*   **Precedent Setting:** Reinforces the Supreme Court's power to sanction judges, even post-mortem, for dereliction of duty.
*   **Lack of prejudice to the complainant:** It is not clear that the five month delay materially prejudiced the complainant in the pending criminal case.
