## Legal Document Summary: Daroy v. Abecia, A.C. No. 3046 (1998)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Esteban Abecia for alleged malpractice, specifically forging his client Regalado Daroy's signature on a Deed of Absolute Sale.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Allegation of Forgery:** Daroy alleges Abecia forged his signature on a deed of sale transferring land acquired through a sheriff's sale (resulting from a case where Abecia was Daroy's counsel) to Jose Gangay, then to Abecia's wife, Nena Abecia.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:** While NBI report suggests forgery, the Notary Public and a witness affirm Daroy signed the deed.
*   **Art. 1491 Issue:** Initially, the premise was that the transfer to Abecia's wife was invalid due to Art. 1491 of the Civil Code, which prohibits lawyers from acquiring property subject to litigation.
*   **Defense:** Abecia argues Daroy knew of and consented to the transfer to his wife and was represented with his assignee Nena Abecia by the deputy sheriff. Abecia referenced the sheriffs return in which it stated that Regalado Daroy and his assignee Nena Abecia were placed in possession of the land. Abecia claims that Daroy was aware of the transfer to his wife as early as 1973.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1491, Civil Code:** Focuses on the prohibition of lawyers acquiring property in litigation. The court references the jurisprudence established in *Guevara v. Calalang, 117 SCRA 7 (1982)*.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  Daroy, as complainant, bears the burden of proving the forgery and lack of consent.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Abecia's Professional Responsibility:** The core issue is whether Abecia violated his duty of fidelity and integrity to his client. A finding of forgery would constitute serious professional misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Evidence on Forgery:** Discrepancy between the NBI report and the testimony of the Notary Public and witness presents a major evidentiary challenge.
*   **Complainant's Credibility:** Daroy's claim of discovering the fraud only in 1984 is undermined by the 1973 Sheriff's Return and 1974 Fiscal's Resolution referencing Nena Abecia's ownership. The inconsistency weakens his credibility.
*   **Ambiguity of "Assignee":** The meaning of "assignee" in the Sheriff's Return needs clarification. Does it imply a legitimate assignment of rights or a mere acknowledgement of the transfer, regardless of its validity?

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the IBP's recommendation of indefinite suspension and *dismissed* the complaint against Abecia. The Court found Daroy's claim of not knowing about the transfer lacked credibility and held that the facts did not support a finding that Abecia violated Art. 1491.
