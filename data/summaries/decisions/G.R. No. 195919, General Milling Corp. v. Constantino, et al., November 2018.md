**Case Summary: General Milling Corporation v. Constantino, G.R. No. 195919 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's dismissal of a complaint for Cancellation of Miscellaneous Lease Application (MLA), Foreshore Lease Application (FLA), TCT No. T-15846 with Injunction, Damages, and Prayer for Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order (TRO).

**Key Issue:** Whether GMC is liable for damages arising from the demolition of houses on land claimed by both GMC and the respondents.

**Facts:**

*   GMC claimed ownership of Lot Nos. 19053 and 21827 in Cagayan de Oro City.
*   GMC accused residents (Respondents) of squatting and sought assistance from the DPWH, who deemed the structures illegal for lack of building permits, per Section 301 of P.D. 1906 (National Building Code).
*   Respondents filed suit challenging GMC's MLA and FLA, alleging prior possession and ownership since time immemorial.
*   GMC demolished approximately 200 houses.
*   Respondents amended their complaint to seek damages, alleging violation of Section 28 of RA No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act) regarding eviction procedures.
*   RTC ruled for GMC, finding they proved ownership and the demolition was justified under Article 429 of the Civil Code (right to exclude).
*   CA reversed, awarding damages to Respondents (nominal, moral, exemplary, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses). CA directed copy of the decision be furnished to Department of Environment and Natural Resources for proper action.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** Granted GMC's petition, reversed the CA, and dismissed the respondents' complaint.

**Key Provisions and Analysis:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** The core issue revolves around the ownership of the land. The CA lacked the authority to decide on public land alleged to have been fraudulently titled and such issue should be determined through reversion proceedings under Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 141 (for cancellation of homestead or free patents to be commenced by the Government, or through annulment of judgment or final orders and resolutions).
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Supreme Court emphasized that in civil cases, the party making allegations has the burden of proving them by a preponderance of evidence, citing *Sps. Ramos v. Obispo, et al., 705 Phil. 221, 229 (2013)*. Respondents failed to sufficiently prove their prior possession or ownership or right.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The SC found the Respondents' evidence insufficient to support their claims. The SC noted inconsistencies in witness testimony, lack of proof linking Respondents to specific demolished structures, and absence of evidence to support the extent of damages claimed.
*   **Damages:** The SC reversed the CA's award of damages, stating the nominal damages are only awarded to vindicate or recognize that right, and not for indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him, citing *Libcap Marketing Corp., et al. v. Baquial, 737 Phil. 349, 361 (2014)*. Also, moral damages require personal testimony of mental anguish, citing *Mahinay v. Atty. Velasquez, Jr., 464 Phil. 146, 149 (2004)*, which was absent. Exemplary damages cannot be awarded in the absence of moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages per Articles 2229 and 2234 of the Civil Code. Attorney's fees were also improper as the circumstances under Article 2208 of the Civil Code were not present.
*   **Section 28, RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act):** While Respondents argued violation of this provision, the Court didn't directly address it. However, the finding that Respondents failed to prove their prior possession and ownership undermines any claim based on unlawful eviction procedures.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Possession:** The court focused on respondents' failure to provide proof of their possession (tax declarations, receipts). This highlights the importance of meticulous record-keeping.
*   **Corporate Liability:** The decision reinforces the need for plaintiffs to specifically link damages to individual members of a group, rather than relying on a general claim.
*   **Building Official Authority:** The CA ruling questioning the City Building Official's authority to order demolition based solely on lack of permits *was not* explicitly overturned by the Supreme Court. This aspect may still present ambiguity and requires careful attention in future cases involving similar facts.
*   **Article 429, Civil Code (Self-Help):** The RTC relied on this to justify the demolition. The SC's decision doesn't explicitly approve or disapprove of this application of Article 429, creating uncertainty about the permissible bounds of self-help in property disputes.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision hinged on the Respondents' failure to adequately prove their prior possession and damages. It underscores the importance of meticulous evidence presentation in land disputes. However, ambiguities remain regarding the scope of building official's authority and the applicability of Article 429 of the Civil Code. Further litigation may clarify these points.
