## Legal Document Summary: *Carlos N. Nisda vs. Sea Serve Maritime Agency and Khalifa A. Algosaibi Diving and Marine Services* (G.R. No. 179177)

This case involves a claim for disability benefits by seafarer Carlos N. Nisda (Petitioner) against Sea Serve Maritime Agency (Respondent Sea Serve) and Khalifa A. Algosaibi Diving and Marine Services (Respondent ADAMS). The core issue is whether Nisda's coronary artery disease is compensable under his POEA-SEC.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Contracts:** Two employment contracts are at issue: a POEA-approved contract dated 7 August 2001 (POEA-SEC) and a later, POEA-unsanctioned, contract dated 30 August 2001. The POEA-SEC specified a 9-month term and a monthly salary of $1,437.00. The unsanctioned agreement specified a 448-day term, and a monthly salary of $1,650.
*   **Illness:** Nisda was diagnosed with Severe Three Vessel Coronary Artery Disease and Left Ventricle Diastolic Dysfunction, requiring triple bypass surgery. He initially complained of parascapular pain with paresthesia while still at sea, which was before the end of his POEA approved contract.
*   **Medical Examinations:** Initial diagnosis of Myositis in Saudi Arabia. Post-repatriation ECG revealed LVH with strain and/or ischemia. Coronary Angiogram confirmed severe coronary artery disease.
*   **Affidavit of Assumption:** Nobel transferred its accreditation to Sea Serve, who executed an affidavit of assumption of responsibility for all contractual obligations to seafarers originally recruited by Nobel for specified vessels, including the vessel Nisda was on.
*   **Procedural History:** Labor Arbiter initially ruled in Nisda's favor. The NLRC reversed, finding the illness not compensable under the POEA-SEC. The Court of Appeals affirmed the NLRC decision.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Under the POEA-SEC, employers are liable for work-related injuries or illnesses suffered during the contract term.
*   Respondent Sea Serve, as transferee agency, assumed full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations to seafarers, including Nobel's contractual liabilities to the Filipino workers.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Unapproved Contract:** The validity of the 30 August 2001 contract is questionable under Republic Act No. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act), as it was not approved by the POEA and could be construed as an attempt to alter an existing contract to the detriment of the seafarer. *Placewell International Services Corporation v. Camote* is relevant here.
*   **Timeliness of Diagnosis:** Determining when the disease manifested itself relative to the contract expiration date is crucial. The court notes that the medical examination and diagnosis of a "severe" condition, as well as the previous parascapular pain indicate a possible, if undiagnosed, pre-existing work-related condition, as supported by *Seagull Shipmanagement and Transport, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission.* The Court also notes the fact of Respondent ADAMS having already remitted amounts to the hospital/medical center for the bypass operation.
*   **Definition of Work-Related Illness:** The court notes that Sec. 32-A(11) of the 2000 POEA Amended Standard Terms and Conditions explicitly considers Cardio-Vascular Disease as an occupational disease given certain risk factors are present.

**Statutory References:**

*   2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels (POEA-SEC)
*   Labor Code (Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code)
*   NLRC Rules of Procedure
*   1991 POEA Rules and Regulations Governing Overseas Employment

**Case Law:**

*   *Placewell International Services Corporation v. Camote* (side agreements altering POEA-approved contracts are void)
*   *Seagull Shipmanagement and Transport, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission* (connection between work conditions and heart disease; radioman work conditions led to heart disease, so shipmaster's work should also lead to heart disease)

**Court's Decision:**

The Supreme Court reverses the Court of Appeals, holding that Nisda's coronary artery disease is compensable. It is stated that there has been a connection between the work performed by Nisda and the development of his coronary artery disease, and that therefore, there was an occupational disease under the POEA regulations.
