## Legal Document Summary: *Davao Contractors Development Cooperative (DACODECO) vs. Marilyn A. Pasawa*

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied DACODECO's petition challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) dismissal of its certiorari petition, which sought to overturn the NLRC decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's (LA) finding of illegal dismissal of respondent Pasawa.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Probationary Employment (Art. 281, Labor Code):** The case revolves around the termination of a probationary employee. DACODECO hired Pasawa as General Manager and subsequently terminated her employment. The Labor Code requires employers to inform probationary employees of reasonable standards for regularization at the start of employment.
*   **Requirements for Valid Dismissal of Probationary Employee:** A probationary employee can be dismissed for (1) just cause; or (2) failure to meet reasonable standards made known to them at the start of employment. *Dusit Hotel Nikko v. Gatbonton* reinforces that the burden of proving just or valid cause rests on the employer.
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** Can be a valid ground for dismissal if based on a willful breach of trust, founded on clearly established facts, and not the employer's whim. *AMA Computer College, Inc. v. Garay* establishes that this ground should not afford an occasion for abuse.
*   **Verification and Non-Forum Shopping (Rule 46, Sec. 3, Rules of Court):** DACODECO's CA petition was initially dismissed for procedural defects in the verification and certification of non-forum shopping. Requires proper authorization and certification of Board Resolution.
*   **Statement of Material Dates (Rule 65, Rules of Court):** The petition lacked crucial dates regarding the NLRC proceedings, specifically, the date of receipt of the NLRC resolution and the date of filing of the motion for reconsideration, which resulted in its dismissal.

**Liabilities:**

*   The LA and NLRC ordered DACODECO to pay Pasawa separation pay and backwages due to the illegal dismissal. The SC affirmed this order.
*   DACODECO failed to prove it informed Pasawa of reasonable standards for regularization, violating Art. 281 of the Labor Code.
*   DACODECO lacked sufficient basis for claiming loss of trust and confidence, undermining the purported just cause for dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Non-Compliance:** Failure to strictly adhere to the Rules of Court (specifically Rules 46 and 65) can lead to dismissal of petitions, as evidenced by the CA's initial dismissal of DACODECO's petition. The Court reiterates that non-compliance is a sufficient ground for dismissal (*Tambong v. R. Jorge Development Corporation*).
*   **Insufficient Documentation of Regularization Standards:** Absence of documented and communicated reasonable standards for probationary employees can expose the employer to claims of illegal dismissal.
*   **Subjective Application of Loss of Trust and Confidence:** If loss of trust and confidence is not based on concrete evidence, but on subjective employer perceptions, it risks being deemed an invalid ground for dismissal (*AMA Computer College, Inc. v. Garay*).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 281:** Probationary Employment.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 46, Sec. 3:** Verification and Non-Forum Shopping requirements for petitions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Petition for Certiorari.
*   ***Dusit Hotel Nikko v. Gatbonton*:** Burden of proof in termination cases rests on the employer.
*   ***AMA Computer College, Inc. v. Garay*:** Standards for loss of trust and confidence as a valid ground for dismissal.
*   ***Tambong v. R. Jorge Development Corporation*:**  Failure to strictly comply with the Rules of Court is grounds for dismissal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Working standard of our cooperative":** This vague phrase in the termination letter was deemed insufficient to justify dismissal. The evaluation committee's unsubstantiated claim that Pasawa made a "false statement" also lacked merit.
*   The Board Resolution authorizing Chavez to represent petitioner before the NLRC only and not to sign for certification of non-forum shopping.

**Overall:** DACODECO's case failed due to a combination of procedural missteps and a failure to establish valid grounds for terminating a probationary employee. They failed to meet the standards for both due process and just cause under the Labor Code.
