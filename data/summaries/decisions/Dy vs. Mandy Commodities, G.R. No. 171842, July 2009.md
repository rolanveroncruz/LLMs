## Legal Document Summary: Dy v. Mandy Commodities Co., Inc., G.R. No. 171842

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) dismissal of petitioner Dy's appeal based on forum shopping. The underlying dispute concerns possession of a sub-leased portion of government-owned land in Binondo, Manila.

**Key Provisions & Events:**

*   **Lease/Sublease Chain:** National Government leased to PNB, which then subleased to respondent Mandy Commodities.
*   **DENR Interventions:** Series of conflicting Memoranda from DENR Secretaries regarding renewal of PNB's lease and sub-lessee status.
*   **PNB Injunction Case:** PNB filed an injunction suit (Civil Case No. 03-0368-CFM) to prevent the Land Management Bureau (LMB) from taking over the property. TRO initially denied, then granted by CA but rendered moot by LMB action.
*   **LMB Provisional Permit:** Pending the PNB Injunction Case, LMB granted petitioner Dy a provisional permit to occupy the property.
*   **Respondent's Forcible Entry Case:** Mandy Commodities filed a forcible entry case against Dy after Dy entered the property (Civil Case No. 176953-CV).
*   **Petitioner's Unlawful Detainer Case:** Dy, during the pendency of the Respondent's Forcible Entry Case, filed an unlawful detainer case against Mandy Commodities (Civil Case No. 00000004-CV).

**Obligations:**

*   **PNB:** Obligation under the lease agreement with the National Government and sublease agreement with Mandy Commodities.
*   **Mandy Commodities:** Obligation under the sublease agreement with PNB.
*   **Dy:** Subject to obligations related to a valid Permit to Occupy, pending resolution of lease dispute.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Dy:** Liable for forcible entry and subject to eviction.
*   Potential liability for damages related to wrongful possession.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Resolution of PNB Injunction Case:** Outcome of the PNB Injunction Case (G.R. No. 164786) could affect the validity of the LMB provisional permit granted to Dy.
*   **Continued litigation:** Multiple cases arising from the same core dispute pose a risk of prolonged and costly legal battles.
*   **Risk from Government Action:** The government, as the underlying lessor, could take further actions to reclaim possession.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court:** Addresses Forum shopping requirements.
*   **Rule 70 of the Rules of Court:** Forcible Entry
*   **Buan v. Lopez, Jr., 229 Phil. 65 (1986); First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals, 322 Phil. 280 (1996); Ba√±es v. Lutheran Church in the Philippines, G.R. No. 142308, 15 November 2005, 475 SCRA 13, 34.** Referenced in discussion of penalties for Forum shopping.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of LMB Provisional Permit:** The validity of the permit issued to Dy is contingent on the outcome of the PNB Injunction Case.
*   **Interpretation of DENR Memoranda:** Ambiguity exists regarding whether the PNB lease was validly renewed, affecting the validity of the sublease to Mandy Commodities.

**Key Takeaway:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal of Dy's appeal due to forum shopping, stemming from her filing an unlawful detainer case while the forcible entry case was pending. This ruling reinforces the principle against forum shopping and highlights the importance of possessing legitimate legal authority for property occupation.
