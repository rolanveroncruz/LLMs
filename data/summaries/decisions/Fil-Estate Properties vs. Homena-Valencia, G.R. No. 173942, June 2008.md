**Legal Document Summary: Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. vs. Hon. Homena-Valencia and Naval, G.R. No. 173942**

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration of a prior Decision denying Petition challenging the RTC's refusal to give due course to an appeal.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Core Dispute:**  Whether the RTC erred in denying Petitioner's appeal based on the late payment of docket fees.  The late payment stemmed from confusion regarding the period to appeal after a Motion for Reconsideration was denied.
*   **Neypes Doctrine:**  The central legal issue revolves around the retroactive application of *Neypes v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 141524), which established a "fresh period rule" granting appellants a new 15-day period from receipt of the order denying a motion for reconsideration to perfect an appeal.
*   **Retroactivity:**  The Court relies on *Sps. De los Santos v. Vda. De Mangubat* (G.R. No. 149508) which *affirms* that *Neypes* *does* have retroactive application to cases pending and undetermined at the time of its passage, which includes the instant case.
*   **Timeliness of Certiorari:**  Respondent argued that the Petitioners' Special Civil Action for Certiorari was not timely filed.  The Court found that the Petitioners *did* timely assail the RTC's order denying the Notice of Appeal.
*   **Relief Granted:** The Court set aside the rulings of the Court of Appeals and the RTC that denied the appeal. The Court of Appeals is directed to give due course to the Petitioners' appeal in Civil Case No. 5626.
*   **Issues Unresolved:**  The court specifically *does not* resolve the underlying merits of the original case (i.e., the RTC's decision on the complaint and the motion for reconsideration). These issues are properly the subject of the appeal before the Court of Appeals.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Court of Appeals:**  Obligated to hear and decide the appeal in Civil Case No. 5626.
*   **Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. and Fairways and Blue-waters Resort and Country Club, Inc.:** Obligated to pursue their appeal diligently before the Court of Appeals.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Determinations:**  The Court explicitly declines to make factual determinations regarding circumstances surrounding the resignation of previous counsel, and service of orders for pre-trial and subsequent notices. This leaves these issues for the Court of Appeals to resolve, presenting potential pitfalls if such issues significantly undermine Fil-Estate's case.
*   **Scope of Appeal:**  The Petitioners did seek proceedings "de novo," and it is unclear how this will influence the Court of Appeals.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 13, Rule 41 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (amended)
*   Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Special Civil Action for Certiorari).
