## Legal Document Summary: *National Power Corporation vs. Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA)* (G.R. No. 171470)

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) decision denying National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR)'s claim for real property tax exemption on machineries and equipment used in the Bauang Diesel Power Plant project under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) agreement.

**Issue:** Whether NAPOCOR, as a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) with a tax-exempt status, can extend this exemption to its BOT partner, Bauang Private Power Corporation (BPPC), a private entity, for machineries and equipment used in power generation. Specifically, can NAPOCOR be considered the "actual, direct, and exclusive user" of the equipment under Section 234(c) of the Local Government Code (LGC; RA 7160)?

**Holding:** Petition denied. The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision, ruling that BPPC, not NAPOCOR, is the actual, direct, and exclusive user of the machineries and equipment, and therefore the tax exemption under Section 234(c) of the LGC does not apply.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **BOT Agreement:**
    *   NAPOCOR provides the site to BPPC at no cost and assumes responsibility for real estate taxes on the site itself, buildings and improvements. **Contention:** NAPOCOR argued this demonstrates their beneficial ownership. The Court rejected this and held that the clause does not bind third parties and that the party assuming this responsibility is a recognition of the other party's (BPPC) RPT liability.
    *   BPPC owns, manages, and operates the power station, converting NAPOCOR's fuel into electricity for a fee. (Clauses 2.08, 2.09). **Risk:** This clearly establishes BPPC's ownership and operational control.
    *   BPPC transfers the power station to NAPOCOR without compensation on the Transfer Date. (Clause 2.11) **Risk:** This contingent ownership does not constitute current "actual, direct, and exclusive use."

*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160):**
    *   **Section 234(c):** Exempts from real property tax all machineries and equipment actually, directly, and exclusively used by local water districts and GOCCs engaged in the supply and distribution of water and/or generation and transmission of electric power. **Contentious Clause:** Interpretation of "actual, direct, and exclusive use."
    *   **Section 199(b):** Defines "actual use" as the purpose for which the property is principally or predominantly utilized by the person in possession.
    *   **Section 216:** Special classification of real properties for lands buildings and other improvements that are directly and exclusively used by GOCCs for generation and transmission of electric power
    *   **Section 218(d):** Provides special assessment levels for lands buildings and other improvements with an assessment level of 10% for GOCCs engaged in supply and distribution of water and/or generation and transmission of electric power

*   **BOT Law (RA 6957, as amended by RA 7718):**
    *   Defines a BOT arrangement. **Risk:** The agreement mirrors the statutory definition, where the private sector proponent owns, operates, and recovers its investment.

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Real Property Tax Liability:** BPPC is liable for real property taxes on the machineries and equipment. NAPOCOR's contractual assumption of this liability does not confer tax exemption on BPPC.
*   **Interpretation of "Actual, Direct, and Exclusive Use":** The Court interpreted this strictly, requiring physical possession and operational control.
*   **Transferability of Tax Exemptions:** Tax exemptions are personal privileges and cannot be transferred contractually.
*   **Public Auction Risk:** NAPOCOR's failure to secure the exemption resulted in the sale of the plant's assets at public auction, potentially disrupting its operations.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **FELS Energy, Inc. v. The Province of Batangas (G.R. No. 168557):** The Court applied the rule of *strictissimi juris* to tax exemptions, ruling that the exemption granted to NPC cannot be extended to FELS Energy, Inc., even if the agreement between them stated that NPC was responsible for payment of real estate taxes.
*   **NAPOCOR v. City of Cabanatuan (G.R. No. 149110):** Reaffirms the strict construction of tax exemption laws.
*   **Velez v. Locsin (55 SCRA 152):** Definition of 'Use'

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Actual, Direct, and Exclusive Use" (LGC Sec. 234(c)):** NAPOCOR argued beneficial ownership and control over the plant, contending that BPPC was merely a contractor. The Court disagreed, emphasizing BPPC's legal ownership, operation, and risk assumption as indicative of actual use.

**Summary and Potential Arguments:**

This case establishes that a GOCC cannot extend its tax-exempt status to its BOT partner for properties used in the BOT project if the GOCC is not the actual, direct, and exclusive user of those properties. The Court applies a strict interpretation of tax exemption laws.

Potential arguments for a similar case: Could perhaps try to show that NPC is an interloper in RPT issue, since the agreement said they would be liable for the payments in relation to the properties, showing that they have interest and legal basis. Also perhaps focus on Section 216 where NPC will get preferential treatment.
