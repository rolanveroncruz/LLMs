## Legal Document Summary: LBP vs. Prado Verde Corp. (G.R. Nos. 208004, 208112, 210243)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari regarding the determination of just compensation for land acquired under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27 and the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Issue:** The primary issue is whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) (acting as a Special Agrarian Court - SAC) determination of just compensation, and the applicable formula to be used in the valuation of the land.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) **SET ASIDE** the CA rulings and **REMANDED** the case to the SAC for re-determination of just compensation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Valuation Formula:** The SC ruled that the SAC erred in applying the formula  `LV = (CNI x 0.60) + (CS x 0.30) + (MV x 0.10)` (A.O. No. 1, Series of 2010, item IV. 2). Instead, the correct formula is `LV = (CNI x 0.90) + (MV x 0.10)` (A.O. No. 1, Series of 2010, item IV.1) because the land has already been distributed to farmer-beneficiaries and the landowner rejected DAR's initial valuation.
*   **Comparable Sales (CS):** The SC found that the SAC erroneously computed the Comparable Sales (CS) factor, relying solely on zonal value without considering comparable sales transactions as required by DAR A.O. No. 05-98.
*   **Interest:** The SC affirmed the imposition of interest on the just compensation. The applicable interest rate is 12% per annum from the time of taking until June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until finality of the SC decision. Thereafter, the total amount of just compensation will earn legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid, consistent with prevailing jurisprudence (citing *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank (LBP):** Is liable to pay Prado Verde Corporation (Prado) just compensation based on the correct formula and factors as determined by the SAC on remand. LBP is also liable for interest on the just compensation.
*   **Prado:** Is obligated to accept the just compensation determined by the SAC following the SC's instructions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Revaluation Discrepancies:** Disagreements may arise during the SAC's re-determination regarding the specific values to be used for Capitalized Net Income (CNI) and Market Value (MV). Disputes may arise on the accuracy and applicability of data.
*   **Further Appeals:** Either party could appeal the SAC's re-determination, leading to further delays and legal costs.
*   **Valuation Challenges:** Prado may argue that the valuation based on the P.D. No. 27 formula is inadequate given the current market value of the land.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Section 17 details the factors for determining just compensation.
*   **Republic Act No. 9700 (Amendments to CARP):** Expressly provides for the mandatory consideration of the DAR basic formula.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 27:** Governs the transfer of land to tenant farmers.
*   **DAR Administrative Orders (AOs):** A.O. No. 5, Series of 1998; A.O. No. 2, Series of 2009; and A.O. No. 1, Series of 2010.  Especially A.O. No. 1, series of 2010 dictates the specific formula to be used for P.D. No. 27 lands.
*   **Alfonso v. Land Bank of the Philippines (G.R. Nos. 181912 & 183347):** Emphasizes the need for courts to consider DAR formulas in determining just compensation unless a reasoned deviation is provided.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Phil-Agro Industrial Corp. (G.R. No. 193987):** Underscores the requirement of prompt and full payment for just compensation.
*    *Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267 (2013).* - Guides the determination of just compensation

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of which specific sub-factors within CNI and MV are to be considered and how they are to be valued could be contentious.
*   Whether the zonal value is a valid basis for determining CS in the absence of any comparable sales transactions in the area.

**Overall Strategy:**

The case is remanded for re-evaluation of just compensation utilizing the prescribed formula by the SC. The case must consider recent case laws regarding CARP to be able to achieve the best outcome possible.
