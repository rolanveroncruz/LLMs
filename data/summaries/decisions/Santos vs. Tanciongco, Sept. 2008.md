**Case Summary: *Fenina R. Santos vs. Judge Erasto D. Tanciongco* (A.M. No. MTJ-06-1631)**

**Summary:**

This administrative matter involves a complaint filed by Fenina R. Santos against Judge Erasto D. Tanciongco for manifest bias, partiality, and neglect of duty in handling Civil Case No. 1334 (Forcible Entry). The Investigating Judge found Judge Tanciongco guilty of gross ignorance of the law and inefficiency amounting to neglect of duty, and the Supreme Court concurred, imposing a fine of P20,000.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Complaint:** Alleges Judge Tanciongco showed bias in accepting Defendant's Answer filed beyond the 10-day reglementary period prescribed by the Rules on Summary Procedure, unjustifiably delayed the proceedings, and did not act on the motion to render judgement.
*   **Rules on Summary Procedure Violation:** Judge Tanciongco allowed a Defendant's Answer filed beyond the 10-day period (Rule 70, Section 6, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure) in a forcible entry case, and instead of 10 days, he required the defendants to answer 15 days from receipt of summons.
*   **Delay in Proceedings:** Significant delays in setting the preliminary conference and resolving motions, contributing to a slow disposition of the case.
*   **Motion to Render Judgment:** Failure to act on the motion to render judgment.
*   **Inhibition:** Judge Tanciongco voluntarily inhibited himself after the complaint. His inhibition however does not absolve him from liability.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge's Duty:** To conduct proceedings in accordance with law and rules, including the Rules on Summary Procedure for forcible entry cases. Obligation to act with diligence and impartiality.
*   **Liability:** Judge Tanciongco is found liable for gross ignorance of the law and inefficiency tantamount to neglect of duty.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Neglect of Duty":** While procedural lapses are evident, determining the degree of "neglect" can be subjective.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Judge Tanciongco's claim of attempting amicable settlement was considered but insufficient to excuse procedural violations.
*   **Prior Admonishment:** The Court noted a prior admonishment to Judge Tanciongco (A.M. No. MTJ-05-1592) for failure to supervise his subordinates and implement an effective records management system. This established a pattern of inefficiency.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 6 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs the period to file answer in summary procedure cases.
*   **Apiag v. Cantero, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1070, February 12, 1997, 268 SCRA 47:** Used as precedent showing human errors can be forgiven.
*   **A.M. No. MTJ-05-1592:** Evidence of prior admonishment served as a basis for determining a habit of bad working ethics.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The finding that the filing of pre-trial brief by the complainant does not mean the complainant is abandoning the motion to strike out answer.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules, especially those governing summary procedure. The Judge's misapplication of timelines and failure to act diligently resulted in administrative liability. The prior admonishment indicates a recurring issue with administrative efficiency. While a "human error" defense may be considered, a consistent pattern of lapses suggests a more systemic problem.
