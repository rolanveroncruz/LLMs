## Legal Document Summary: *Legaspi v. People* & *Daganas v. People* (G.R. Nos. 225753 & 225799)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Petitioners for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA correctly affirmed the conviction for estafa through misappropriation or conversion under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the RPC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA and acquitted Petitioners. The Court held that the prosecution failed to prove all elements of estafa beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Article 315(1)(b), RPC (Estafa through Misappropriation/Conversion):** The Court reiterates the four elements: (1) Receipt of money, goods, or property in trust, on commission, for administration, or under obligation to deliver/return; (2) Misappropriation/conversion or denial of receipt; (3) Prejudice to another; (4) Demand for return.
*   **Lack of Fiduciary Relationship:** The Court emphasized that *mere* receipt of money is insufficient; there must be a fiduciary duty. The Information alleged an investment, creating a debtor-creditor relationship rather than a fiduciary one.  The court cited *Tanzo v. Hon. Drilon* (385 Phil. 790, 800 (2000)) on the need to demonstrate receipt of money as being in trust, on commission or for administration or that the accused has the obligation to deliver or return the same money, goods or personal property received and that it is therefore essential to prove that the accused acquired both material or physical possession and juridical possession of the thing received. The investment arrangement, as alleged, undermined any claim of abuse of confidence.
*   **Lack of Misappropriation/Conversion:** The CA's reliance on a "legal presumption" of misappropriation due to the failure to issue a stock certificate was misplaced.  Cited *Tria v. People* (743 Phil. 441 (2014)), requiring proof that the accused used or disposed of the property as if it were his own or devoted the same to an entirely different purpose than that agreed upon. The investment was made in iGen-Portal, a separate and distinct legal entity, not directly to the Petitioners, and therefore this element could not be met.
*   **Shares Transferred to Third Party (Balisi):** The transfer of shares to Balisi (even if potentially violating the Anti-Dummy Law) indicated the absence of abuse of confidence and negated the obligation to return the investment directly to the private complainant, Fung Hing Kit.
*   **Judicial Admissions:** The Court noted the prosecution's judicial admissions that the funds were deposited into iGen-Portal's account, further undermining the claim that Petitioners received the money under a fiduciary capacity.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Petitioners were initially found liable by the RTC and CA for estafa and sentenced to imprisonment. This was overturned by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The decision highlights the risk of pursuing criminal charges for estafa when the underlying transaction is an investment that goes sour. The court cited *Spouses Pascual v. Ramos* (433 Phil. 449 (2002))  emphasizing that parties to business transactions must bear the risks of their own decisions and that the courts will not intervene absent a violation of the law.
*   The Court implicitly acknowledges a potential violation of the Anti-Dummy Law (Commonwealth Act No. 108) due to the use of Balisi as a stand-in, but this was not the central issue in the estafa case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial Information was potentially defective in failing to clearly allege a fiduciary relationship or the obligation to return the investment.
*   The application of the legal presumption of misappropriation based solely on the failure to issue a stock certificate to the *intended* investor (versus the actual transferee) was deemed erroneous.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 315(1)(b)
*   Republic Act No. 10951
*   Commonwealth Act No. 108 (Anti-Dummy Law)
*   Corporation Code of the Philippines (particularly Section 63 regarding share transfers)

*   *Santos v. People*, 260 Phil. 519, 526 (1990)
*   *Ponce v. Alsons Cement Corp.*, 442 Phil. 98, 110 (2002)

*   *Vales v. Villa*, 35 Phil. 769, 787-788 (1916)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction based on the failure of the prosecution to prove essential elements of estafa under Article 315(1)(b) of the RPC, specifically the fiduciary relationship and misappropriation/conversion.  The decision emphasizes the importance of establishing a clear duty to deliver or return the funds and avoiding the application of presumptions in the absence of direct evidence of misappropriation.  While the Court acknowledged potential issues under the Anti-Dummy Law, it did not address them in the context of this criminal case.
