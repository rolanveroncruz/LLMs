# People of the Philippines vs. Joeral Galleno - Case Summary

**Case Citation:** 353 Phil. 942 (G.R. No. 123546, July 2, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Automatic review of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Accused-Appellant Galleno of statutory rape under Republic Act No. 7659 amending Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing him to death.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant Galleno, a 19-year-old male, was accused of raping a 5-year-old girl, Evelyn Obligar Garganera, while she was alone at home.
*   The prosecution presented evidence showing vaginal laceration of the victim, profuse bleeding, and her admission of carnal knowledge to medical professionals. Medical evidence indicated the laceration could have been caused by a blunt instrument, including a penis in full erection.
*   The accused claimed accidental insertion of his finger during play.
*   The trial court found Galleno guilty beyond reasonable doubt and imposed the death penalty.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Statutory Rape (RA 7659 amending Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code):** The central issue is whether the prosecution proved all elements of statutory rape beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The court assessed the credibility of the victim's testimony, medical evidence (vaginal laceration), and the accused's defense of denial.
*   **Admissibility and Weight of Expert Testimony:** The defense challenged the weight given to medical testimony due to the absence of spermatozoa and alternative possible causes of the injury.
*   **Credibility of Child Witness:** The court considered the reliability of the child's testimony and potential confusion due to her age.
*   **Validity of Arrest:** The Accused questioned the validity of his warrantless arrest and the circumstances thereof.
*   **Admissibility of Settlement Offers:** The trial court inferred guilt from the accused's father's offers of financial assistance to the victim's family. The court determined that such payments were made with the intention of settling the case.
*   **Judicial Impartiality:** The accused alleged judicial bias due to the trial judge's participation in cross-examination.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Obligation to present credible evidence to rebut the prosecution's case. He is liable for the death penalty and civil indemnity of P50,000 if convicted, plus any other applicable penalties under the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Prosecution:** Obligation to prove all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Trial Court:** Obligation to conduct a fair and impartial trial.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in Credibility Assessment:**  Assessing the credibility of a young child and the accused is inherently subjective and could be challenged on appeal.
*   **Interpretation of Financial Assistance:**  The interpretation of the offer of financial assistance as an admission of guilt could be challenged if it is not clearly and convincingly linked to an intent to settle the case, especially if the parties had a close relationship.
*   **Constitutionality of Death Penalty:** Though the court upheld the death penalty as constitutional, it acknowledged dissent on the issue citing *People vs. Echegaray* (G.R. No. 117472, February 7, 1997).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 335:**  Governs the crime of rape, particularly as amended by RA 7659.
