## Legal Document Summary: Hulst v. PR Builders, Inc. (G.R. No. 156364)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on Motion for Partial Reconsideration modifying a prior Supreme Court Decision.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a Contract to Sell a condominium unit to a foreign national (Jacobus Bernhard Hulst) in light of constitutional restrictions on alien land ownership.

**Prior Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA) decision was reversed and set aside. The HLURB decision was declared null and void and the HLURB Arbiter Aquino and Director Ceniza were directed to issue the corresponding certificates of sale in favor of the winning bidder, Holly Properties Realty Corporation. Petitioner was originally ordered to return the excess of sale (P2,125,540.00) to the Respondent.

**Motion for Partial Reconsideration:** Petitioner Hulst contested the order to return the excess proceeds, arguing the transaction involved a condominium unit, not land ownership, and therefore did not violate constitutional restrictions.

**Holding (Modified Decision):** The Motion for Partial Reconsideration is GRANTED. The portion of the original decision ordering Hulst to return the excess proceeds to PR Builders is DELETED. The Court acknowledges that the transaction is governed by the Condominium Act (RA 4726).

**Key Provisions and Legal Basis:**

*   **Republic Act No. 4726 (Condominium Act):** This statute allows foreign nationals to own Philippine real estate through condominium units with Condominium Certificates of Title.
*   **Section 5, RA 4726:** Explicitly allows transfer of condominium units to foreigners, subject to limitations on alien ownership in the Condominium Corporation (not exceeding 40% of capital stock).
*   **Condominium Corporation:** Land is owned by the Condominium Corporation, and the unit owner is a member. As long as 60% of the members of the corporation are Filipino citizens, foreigners can own up to 40% of the corporation.
*   **Contract to Sell Clause:** Section 3 of the Contract to Sell explicitly states that the buyer will acquire rights, interests, and title to the UNIT and appurtenant common areas, along with the corresponding Condominium Certificate of Title. The title conveyed is subject to the Condominium Act, Master Deed, and other relevant regulations.

**Obligations:**

*   **PR Builders, Inc.:** Obligated to deliver the Deed of Absolute Sale and Condominium Certificate of Title to Hulst upon full payment.
*   **Hulst:** Obligated to abide by the provisions of the Condominium Act, Master Deed, and other regulations governing the condominium.

**Liabilities:** The original liability to return excess auction proceeds was removed from Hulst.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Corporation Compliance:** While the contract is valid on its face, there are potential compliance issues for PR Builders if the overall foreign ownership in the Condominium Corporation exceeds the 40% limit prescribed by RA 4726.
*   **Future Disputes:** The resolution hinges on the interpretation and application of the Condominium Act. Future disputes could arise if the specific terms of the Master Deed or the Condominium Corporation's by-laws are not adhered to.
*   **Ambiguities:** Lack of specific detail of Hulst's actual ownership percentage of shares in the Corporation may prove to be contentious.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **City Treasurer of Makati v. BA Lepanto Condominium Corporation, G.R. No. 154993, October 25, 2005, 474 SCRA 258:** This case is cited to support the principle of separation of land ownership from unit ownership in a condominium setup.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 4726 (The Condominium Act)**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957 (Regulating the Sale of Subdivision Lots and Condominiums, Providing Penalties for Violations Thereof)**

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court Resolution clarifies the application of the Condominium Act, allowing the transfer of condominium units to foreign nationals provided the 60/40 Filipino/Foreign ownership rule in the Condominium Corporation is maintained. The decision removes the financial burden previously placed on Hulst but does not eliminate potential risks associated with ensuring ongoing compliance with condominium regulations. Further review of the Condominium Corporation's records would be recommended.
