**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Omar and Moshiera Latip vs. Rosalie Palaña Chua*, G.R. No. 177809, October 16, 2009**

**Nature of Document:**  Supreme Court Decision in an unlawful detainer case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Omar and Moshiera Latip (Lessees)
*   **Respondent:** Rosalie Palaña Chua (Lessor)

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** A contract of lease exists between the parties for two cubicles in the Lessor's building, for a term of six years, from December 1999 to December 2005. The lease contained a 10% yearly increase in the monthly rental of P60,000.
*   **Payment Dispute:** The central dispute is whether the amount of P2,570,000 paid by the Lessees to the Lessor constitutes advance rental payments or "goodwill money," a customary payment in the Baclaran area.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:**  The Lessor filed an unlawful detainer suit against the Lessees for failure to pay rentals.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The CA erred in taking judicial notice of the supposed practice of paying goodwill money in the Baclaran area.
*   **Reconciliation of Documents:** The court reconciled the existence of the lease agreement with the receipts for P2,570,000, concluding the latter constituted advance rental payments.

**Obligations:**

*   **Lessor (Rosalie Chua):**  Provide quiet enjoyment of the leased premises.
*   **Lessees (Spouses Latip):**  Pay rent and vacate the premises after lease termination.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Lessees (Spouses Latip):**  Liable for unpaid rentals, as determined under the contract of lease, minus the P2,570,000 already paid as advance rentals.
*    **Lessor (Rosalie Chua):** No liabilities determined in the final verdict.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of Payment Purpose:** The receipts do not explicitly state whether the P2,570,000 was for full payment of rentals, advance rentals, or "goodwill money." This ambiguity fueled the entire litigation.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The taking of judicial notice of the 'goodwill money' practice was contentious and ultimately overturned.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129, Sections 1 & 2:**  Discusses mandatory and discretionary judicial notice.  Cited in relation to the CA's improper taking of judicial notice.
*   ***State Prosecutors v. Muro***, A.M. No. RTJ-92-876, September 19, 1994, 236 SCRA 505:  Outlines the requisites for proper taking of judicial notice.
*   ***Expertravel & Tours, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***, G.R. No. 152392, May 26, 2005, 459 SCRA 147:  Reiterates the requirements of notoriety for judicial notice.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 1371-1373:** Pertaining to the interpretation of contracts, used to interpret the receipts.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA decision, and held Spouses Latip liable for unpaid rentals *minus* the P2,570,000.  Given the lease term ended in 2005, eviction was upheld due to the lapsed lease term and obligation to settle payment.
