## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Masalihit

**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Cesar Masalihit y Mondido, G.R. No. 124329, December 14, 1998

**Nature:** Appeal of a death sentence conviction for rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Accused was charged with and convicted of rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (prior to RA 8353 amendments).
*   **Conviction:**  The trial court found the accused "GUILTY" beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape.
*   **Sentence:** DEATH Penalty.

**Central Issue:** Sufficiency of evidence to prove rape beyond reasonable doubt, particularly regarding the element of carnal knowledge.

**Ruling:** Acquittal. The Supreme Court REVERSED the trial court's decision, ACQUITTING the accused due to the prosecution's failure to prove rape beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Legal Arguments & Case Law:**

*   **Lack of Carnal Knowledge:** The Court held that the prosecution failed to establish carnal knowledge (penetration) with moral certainty. The complainant's testimony lacked specific details of penetration, and no other evidence corroborated the claim of sexual intercourse.
    *   *Martinez v. People, 422 P2d 44*:  While a female's statement of actual penetration is not required in the prosecution for rape, some evidence, other than inference, is essential to prove intercourse.

*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterated that the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt (*Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non que negat*).
    *   *People v. Subingsubing, G.R. Nos. 104942-43, 25 November 1993, 228 SCRA 174*: In criminal cases the prosecution has the onus probandi in establishing the guilt of the accused.

*   **Uncorroborated Testimony:** The complainant's testimony was deemed insufficient to convict the accused, as it was uncorroborated by other witnesses (specifically, her brother and "Ate Pilar" who were supposedly present). The prosecution provided no explanation for their absence.

*   **Credibility Issues:** The Court highlighted inconsistencies in the complainant's statements across different stages of the proceedings (Sinumpaang Salaysay, preliminary examination, trial). These inconsistencies pertained to the number of times raped and other important details, undermining her credibility.
    *   *People v. Ignacio, G.R. No. 90318, 24 July 1992, 211 SCRA 802*: Complaining witnessâ€™ testimony must be impeccable and must ring throughout with, or bear the stamp of, absolute truth and candor.

*   **Medical Evidence:** The medical findings (ruptured hymen) were inconclusive and could not definitively establish rape. The examining physician could not confirm the lacerations were due to sexual encounter.
    *   *People v. Batis, G.R. Nos. 94188-89, 17 December 1992, 216 SCRA 685-686*: A ruptured hymen is not synonymous with rape. It may only prove that complaining witness had prior sexual intercourse but not necessarily with accused-appellant.

*   **Dissent:** Justice Vitug dissented, arguing that the complainant's testimony and the police investigation report sufficiently established the fact of rape and the identity of the perpetrator. He urged for re-examination by Congress of the death penalty law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Inference:** The initial conviction was based largely on inference (the accused was found on top of the complainant wiping her private parts), which the Supreme Court found insufficient.
*   **Weak Prosecution:** The prosecution's failure to present key witnesses and adequately address inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony contributed to the reversal.
*   **Due Process:** The Court emphasizes the importance of due process and ensuring guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt, especially in capital cases.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   The degree of penetration required to prove carnal knowledge under Art. 335 (pre-RA 8353). The Court implied that some level of penetration is required.
*   Whether the inconsistences were so significant and damaging to the credibility of the evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (Rape, prior to RA 8353 amendment)
*   Republic Act No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law)

This case serves as a reminder of the high evidentiary standard required for rape convictions, particularly in the absence of corroborating evidence. It also highlights the importance of consistent testimony and thorough investigation.
