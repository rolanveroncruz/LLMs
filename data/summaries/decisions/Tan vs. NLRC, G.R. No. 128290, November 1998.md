## Legal Document Summary: Tan v. NLRC, United Laboratories Inc., et al. G.R. No. 128290

**Case Summary:**

This is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, appealing the NLRC's affirmation of the Labor Arbiter's decision, which dismissed the petitioner's (Eliseo Tan) complaint for constructive and illegal dismissal against his employer, United Laboratories Inc.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Management Prerogative to Transfer:** The court reaffirms the employer's right to transfer employees based on business needs, provided it's not unreasonable, discriminatory, demoting, or diminishing in pay. (Citing *Philippine Japan Active Carbon Corp. v. NLRC*, 171 SCRA 164, 168)
*   **No Constructive Dismissal:** Tan's temporary reassignment to Sorsogon did not constitute constructive dismissal as he retained his rank and pay. The transfer was a valid exercise of management prerogative to address a sales slump.
*   **Valid Cause for Dismissal (Loss of Trust & Confidence):** The Court upheld the NLRC's finding that there was a valid cause for dismissal due to loss of trust and confidence based on Tan's actions, including usurpation of authority, insubordination, and disruptive behavior. Tan was a sales supervisor, a position requiring trust. (Citing *Lamsan Trading, Inc. v. Leogardo Jr.*, 144 SCRA 571, 576)

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (United Laboratories Inc.):** Liable for violating due process requirements in the dismissal procedure.
*   **Employee (Eliseo Tan):** Guilty of conduct justifying loss of trust and confidence, which constitutes valid cause for termination.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Due Process Violation:** The most critical point. United Laboratories failed to adhere to its own internal disciplinary procedures (automatic review by the ERB), and the notices provided to Tan were insufficient to clearly indicate that his dismissal was being sought.
*   **Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** While the case does not explicitly define any ambiguous or contentious clauses in any contract or agreement, the application of management prerogative in the context of employee transfer is often a point of contention.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Philippine Japan Active Carbon Corp. v. NLRC (171 SCRA 164, 168):** Defines the limits of an employer's prerogative to transfer employees.
*   **Lamsan Trading, Inc. v. Leogardo Jr. (144 SCRA 571, 576):** Defines loss of trust and confidence as just cause.
*   **Paguio Transport Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission and Wilfredo Melchor**: Twin requirements of due process (notice and hearing).

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Certiorari)

**Indemnity:**

*   Because United Laboratories dismissed Tan for a valid cause but without due process, the Court ordered United Laboratories to pay Tan an indemnity of P5,000.

**Conclusion:**

The Court *affirmed* that the dismissal was for cause, but *modified* the decision to include an indemnity payment to the employee for the due process violation. Focus should be on the lack of adherence to internal disciplinary rules and the insufficient nature of the notices provided to Tan.
