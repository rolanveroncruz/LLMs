**Case Summary: Landcenter Construction and Development Corporation vs. V.C. Ponce, Co., Inc. and Vicente C. Ponce (G.R. No. 160409, October 2, 2009)**

**Nature of Dispute:** Dispute over ownership of the Fourth Estate Subdivision, originally titled under TCT No. 97084 in the name of V.C. Ponce Co., Inc. The property was subdivided but later mortgaged to PCI Bank, which foreclosed. The property was eventually sold to Landcenter Construction and Development Corporation (Landcenter). V.C. Ponce Co., Inc. (Ponce) then contested ownership, claiming a forged Deed of Assignment.

**Key Provisions and Transactions:**

*   **Mortgage and Foreclosure:** Ponce mortgaged the entire property (TCT No. 97084) to PCI Bank, including the subdivided lots. PCI Bank foreclosed due to non-payment.
*   **Sale to Landcenter:** PCI Bank sold the foreclosed property to Landcenter.
*   **Deed of Assignment (Contested):** Ponce presented a Deed of Assignment purportedly signed by Landcenter’s president transferring ownership back to Ponce. Landcenter claimed forgery and lack of board authorization. This Deed is at the heart of the dispute.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** An earlier compromise agreement in Civil Case No. 33017 between the parties involved reconveyance of 24 lots. This agreement weakens Ponce's claim for the entire property through the contested Deed.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Ponce:** Initially obligated to pay the mortgage to PCI Bank. Subsequently, potentially obligated under the compromise agreement to accept only 24 lots in settlement.
*   **Landcenter:** Obligated under the potential Compromise Agreement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Landcenter:** Risk of losing ownership if the Deed of Assignment is proven valid. Potential liability for damages.
*   **Ponce:** Risk of failing to prove the validity of the Deed of Assignment. Potential exposure to legal costs.
*   **Risk of Multiple Suits:** The RTC injunction against both parties selling the property acknowledges the risk of multiple suits arising from the competing claims.

**Ambiguous and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Deed of Assignment:** The central point of contention is whether the Deed of Assignment is genuine and authorized. Specifically, whether Manuel Ponce, as president, validly signed the deed.
*   **Effect of RTC withdrawal:** the legal impact of the withdrawal of the complaint by Landcenter on the orders previously issued by the RTC.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 17, Section 2 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs dismissal of complaints upon motion of the plaintiff and the terms and conditions involved. *Servicewide Specialists, Inc. v. CA* (327 Phil. 431 (1996)): Addresses the effect of dismissing or discontinuing an action on previous orders and rulings.
* *Rodriguez, Jr. v. Aguilar, Sr.* (G.R. No. 159482, August 30, 2005, 468 SCRA 373, 384-385) The impact of withdrawl of a motion for reconsideration
* Olympia International, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. L-43236, December 20, 1989, 180 SCRA 353 The impact of abandonming a civil action on the period of limitation.

**Potential Defenses/Arguments:**

*   **Landcenter:** Argue the forgery of the Deed of Assignment and lack of corporate authorization. Emphasize the previous compromise agreement as evidence of Ponce's limited claim.
*   **Ponce:** Prove the validity of the Deed of Assignment.

**Analysis:**

The core issue revolves around the Deed of Assignment. Landcenter has a strong argument based on prior foreclosure and sale. The Court of Appeals decision seems to be leaning towards the principle of restoring the parties to their original position before the withdrawal of the complaint. The validity of the withdrawal of the complaint and its effect on the parties’ rights are based on Rule 17 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and related jurisprudence.
