**Legal Document Summary: People v. Macabare, G.R. No. 179941 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 16 of Republic Act No. (RA) 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) regarding possession of regulated drugs.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 16, RA 6425:** Prohibits the possession or use of regulated drugs without a license or prescription. The penalty for possessing 200 grams or more of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) is *reclusion perpetua* to death and a fine ranging from PhP 500,000 to PhP 10,000,000.
*   **Section 3(j), Rule 131, Rules of Court:** Establishes the disputable presumption that a person who possesses something exercises ownership over it. This shifts the burden of proof to the accused to disprove ownership.

**Facts:**

*   Lito Macabare, a detention prisoner, was found in possession of 410.6 grams of shabu inside his "kubol" (cubicle) in Manila City Jail during a search conducted based on a confidential tip.
*   Macabare denied ownership, claiming other inmates had access to his kubol.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Court found the circumstantial evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. This included: Macabare's assignment to the kubol, his lone occupancy at the time of the search, the discovery of the shabu in a cooler within the kubol, and his inability to explain the presence of the drugs.
*   **Constructive Possession:** The Court applied the concept of constructive possession (citing *People v. Tira*, G.R. No. 139615) meaning that the shabu was under his dominion and control even if it wasn't in his immediate physical possession.
*   **Disputable Presumption of Ownership:** The Court invoked Section 3(j), Rule 131, holding that Macabare failed to rebut the presumption that he owned the drugs found in his possession. His denial was deemed insufficient.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** While acknowledging that the presumption of innocence takes precedence over the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, the Court concluded that the circumstantial evidence and the lack of evidence of improper motive on the part of the jail officers supported the conviction.
* Credited the jail officer's positive and categorical testimony over Macabare's defense of denial.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision finding Macabare guilty of violating Section 16 of RA 6425. The imposed fine was reduced from PhP 5,000,000 to PhP 500,000.

**Liabilities:**

*   Macabare is liable for *reclusion perpetua* and a fine of PhP 500,000 for possession of 410.6 grams of shabu.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence:**  The conviction hinges heavily on circumstantial evidence. While deemed sufficient, the defense could argue that the evidence is susceptible to other interpretations, especially given the communal living environment of the jail.
*   **Chain of Custody:**  The summary does not explicitly mention a challenge to the chain of custody. If there were any breaks in the chain, that could present a potential avenue for appeal, potentially impacting the admissibility of the shabu as evidence.
*   **Due Process/Entrapment:** No information suggests these potential risks, but more facts may illuminate one, for example, coerced or unread Miranda Rights, or the jail officials 'setting-up' the accused.
