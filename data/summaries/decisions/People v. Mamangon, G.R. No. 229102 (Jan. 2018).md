**Case Summary: People v. Mamangon, G.R. No. 229102 (2018)**

This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Philip Mamangon for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11(3) (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  The SC *acquitted* Mamangon, reversing the CA and RTC rulings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sections 5 & 11(3), Article II, RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value. This includes immediate physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official. The seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 as amended by RA 10640:** Allows inventory and photography at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team in instances of warrantless seizure.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165:** Provides that non-compliance with Section 21 is permissible under justifiable grounds, provided the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items are preserved.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused was initially found liable for Life Imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 for illegal sale.
*   The accused was also found liable for Imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, as maximum, and to pay a fine of P300,000.00 for illegal possession.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The core risk is the compromised chain of custody. The police failed to secure the presence of an elected public official and representatives from the DOJ and media during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs. The police went to the Barangay hall, but left when "no one was around" failing to take further steps to comply.
*   **Unjustified Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide a justifiable reason for the procedural lapses.  The explanation that "no one was around" at the barangay hall was deemed insufficient and unsubstantiated.  The court cannot presume the existence of justifiable grounds.
*   **Impact of Non-Compliance:** The SC emphasized that strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 is a substantive requirement, not a mere technicality.  The unjustified deviation from this procedure casts serious doubt on the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated drugs, leading to acquittal.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Highlights the importance of the presence of representatives from the media, DOJ, or an elected public official to prevent switching, planting, or contamination of evidence.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** The prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses, and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** The justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact, because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist.

**Legal Precision & Analysis:**

The SC applied the "saving clause" of Section 21, RA 9165 and its IRR. However, it found that the prosecution failed to meet the requirements for the saving clause to apply, as they did not adequately demonstrate a justifiable ground for non-compliance with the mandatory witness requirement. The court did not accept the "no one was around" explanation for non-compliance. The failure to follow procedure and preserve the chain of custody of the evidence raised reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. The decision reinforces the stringent requirements for drug cases and highlights the duty of law enforcement to adhere strictly to prescribed procedures.
