## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Sayo, Jr. et al. (G.R. No. 129918)

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari challenging RTC orders granting execution to Noah's Ark for warehouseman's lien.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Warehouse Receipts Law (Act No. 2137):** Governs the validity and enforcement of warehouseman's lien. Sections 8, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, & 36 are relevant.
*   **Civil Code:** Pledges and mortgages of the warehoused goods. (Articles 1149, 1345, 2088, 2095, 2112, & 2115).
*   **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Law (RA 7653, Section 103):** Exemption of bank reserves from garnishment.
*   **Rules of Court (Rule 39, Sections 1, 2, 9b):** Execution of judgments, including execution pending appeal and option to specify property for levy.

**Factual Summary:**

PNB, as endorsee/pledgee of warehouse receipts (quedans), sought delivery of sugar stocks from Noah's Ark Sugar Refinery. Noah's Ark refused, claiming ownership and later asserting a warehouseman's lien for storage fees. The case has a long procedural history, with multiple appeals to the Supreme Court. Previous SC decisions (G.R. No. 107243 and G.R. No. 119231) established PNB's right to the sugar upon payment of storage fees and recognized the warehouseman's lien of Noah's Ark. The current dispute concerns the validity and amount of that lien.

**Obligations:**

*   **PNB:** Obligated to pay Noah's Ark's valid warehouseman's lien before receiving the sugar. The SC has limited this obligation to the fees accruing up to the date of refusal to deliver.
*   **Noah's Ark:** Obligated to deliver the sugar upon payment of the valid lien. Lost its lien by refusing a valid demand for delivery, based on a claim of ownership instead.
*   Warehouseman is entitled to the warehouseman's lien that attaches to the goods invokable against anyone who claims a right of possession thereon.

**Liabilities:**

*   The amount of the lien.
*   PNB is liable for warehouse fees from the issuance of the quedans up to the refusal to deliver the goods in March 1990. The pledgeors, not the pledgee, is liable for the obligations to pay the warehousing fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Amount of the Lien:** The computation of the lien is highly contested. PNB argues the amount awarded is excessive, unsubstantiated, and exceeds industry standards. Judge Se previously considered the amount claimed by private respondents to be unacceptable.
*   **Validity of Refining Contracts:** The validity of the refining contracts used to calculate storage fees is disputed, particularly whether PNB, as a pledgee, is bound by them. Rosa Ng Sy denied their existence.
*   **Due Process Violation:** PNB alleges it was denied due process during the lien determination hearing, lacking the opportunity to present its own evidence and cross-examine witnesses. PNB also claims its Urgent Motion to Nullify Court Proceedings was ignored and never resolved by the trial court.
*   **Waiver:** PNB argues Noah's Ark waived its lien by failing to raise it as a counterclaim earlier in the proceedings.
*   **Prescription/Laches:** PNB claims Noah's Ark's lien claim is barred by prescription and laches. (Article 1149 of the Civil Code)
*   **Sufficiency of Sugar Stock:** PNB questions whether Noah's Ark maintained sufficient sugar stock to justify the claimed storage fees.
*   **Garnishment:** The garnishment of PNB's funds at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may violate Section 103 of RA 7653 if those funds constitute legal reserves.
*   Whether the demand to obtain possession of the goods complied with Section 8 of the Warehouse Receipts Law

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **G.R. No. 107243 (PNB v. Noah's Ark):** Establishes PNB as a pledgee of the quedans.
*   **G.R. No. 119231 (PNB v. Se, Jr. et al.):** Affirmed Noah's Ark's entitlement to a warehouseman's lien but did not determine the specific amount. This current case is for the satisfaction of the warehouse lien.
*   **Martinez v. PNB (93 Phil. 765):** Clarifies the rights of a pledgee of warehouse receipts.
*   **PNB v. Atendido (94 Phil. 254):** Further clarifies the rights of the pledgee of warehouse receipts.
*   **Edward v. Arce (98 Phil. 688):** Execution must conform to the dispositive portion of the decision.
*   **Ex-Bataan Veterans Security Agency v. NLRC (250 SCRA 418):** Writ of execution should not exceed the original judgment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The precise interpretation and application of Section 29 of the Warehouse Receipts Law regarding the loss of the warehouseman's lien.
*   The specific parameters for calculating storage fees under the refining contracts and whether PNB is bound by them, considering Rosa Ng Sy's disavowal of such contract.

**Conclusion:**

The SC granted the petition, reversed and set aside the challenged orders, and directed further proceedings for the trial court. The trial court is directed to: allow the PNB to present evidence on the matter of the warehouseman’s lien, compute the PNB’s warehouseman’s lien, and determine if Noah’s Ark maintained sufficient inventory to cover the sugar in the relevant period.
