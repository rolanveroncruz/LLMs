**Case:** *The City Government of Baguio City, et al. vs. Atty. Brain Masweng, et al.* (G.R. No. 180206, February 04, 2009)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision which upheld the NCIP's (National Commission on Indigenous Peoples) injunction against the City of Baguio's demolition orders. The Court held that while the NCIP has jurisdiction over disputes involving ancestral lands of ICCs/IPs, including the power to issue injunctions under IPRA (Republic Act No. 8371), the private respondents (members of the Ibaloi tribe) failed to demonstrate a clear right to be protected by the injunction.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **NCIP Jurisdiction (Sec. 66, 69 IPRA):** The NCIP has original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving ancestral lands/domains of ICCs/IPs, provided customary remedies are exhausted. The NCIP can issue TROs and preliminary injunctions to prevent grave or irreparable damage (NCIP Administrative Circular No. 1-03).
*   **Baguio City Charter (Sec. 78 IPRA):** Baguio City is governed by its Charter, but the Charter must respect prior land rights/titles recognized before IPRA's effectivity.
*   **Requirements for Injunction:** A party seeking an injunction must demonstrate a clear right to be protected and that the enjoined acts violate that right.
*   **Forest Lands:** Forest lands are inalienable and courts lack jurisdiction to adjudicate them. (PD 705, as amended).

**Liabilities:**

*   **City Government Liability:**  The City Government has a general duty to enforce its laws and regulations including demolition of illegal structures.
*   **Private Respondents Liability:**  Private respondents have liability in construction on public land.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **NCIP Jurisdiction Challenges:** Ongoing disputes regarding the scope of NCIP's jurisdiction, particularly when it intersects with local government authority.
*   **Interpretation of "Prior Land Rights":** Ambiguity regarding what constitutes "prior land rights recognized" under Sec. 78 of IPRA. Proclamation No. 15 was not considered as providing definitive recognition of rights, however private respondents' continued occupation may.
*   **Enforcement Difficulties:** Difficulties in enforcing demolition orders when indigenous communities assert ancestral land claims.
*   **Police Power vs. Ancestral Domain Rights:** Potential conflict between the local government's police power and the constitutionally protected rights of indigenous peoples regarding ancestral domain.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Heirs of Gumangan v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. Nos. 75672 and 75673, April 19, 1989, 172 SCRA 563):** Affirmed the inalienable nature of the Busol Forest Reservation.
*   ***Viray v. Court of Appeals*** **(G.R. No. 92481, November 9, 1990, 191 SCRA 308):** Emphasized the requirement of a clear right for injunction.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8371 (Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 - IPRA)**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 705 (Revised Forestry Code)**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096 (National Building Code)**
*   **Republic Act No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act)**
*   **Proclamation No. 15 (Establishing the Busol Forest Reservation)**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sec. 78 of IPRA:** The scope of Baguio City's exemption from IPRA is contentious. The phrase "prior land rights and titles recognized and/or acquired...before the effectivity of this Act" requires careful interpretation, especially in cases where recognition is claimed based on historical occupation and indigenous customary law rather than formal titles. Whether Proclamation No. 15 constitutes such "recognition" is a central point of contention.
*   **Busol Forest Reservation:**  The Court emphasizes the land's inalienability, despite ancestral land claims.  This raises the question of whether *any* recognition of indigenous claims within the reservation is possible under IPRA, and if so, what form that recognition might take.
