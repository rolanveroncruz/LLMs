## Legal Document Summary: Favila v. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 251824)

**Subject:** Motion for Reconsideration of the Supreme Court's decision affirming the COA's disallowance of benefits received by petitioner Peter B. Favila as an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors (BOD) of the Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines (TIDCORP).

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Issue:** Whether Favila is liable to return disallowed amounts received as an ex-officio board member, specifically Productivity Enhancement Pay, Developmental Contribution Bonuses, Corporate Guaranty, Grocery Subsidy, and Anniversary Bonuses.
*   **Grounds for Disallowance:** Violation of Article IX-B, Section 8 of the Constitution (prohibition against double compensation unless specifically authorized by law). Favila's receipt of benefits as an ex-officio member deemed double compensation.
*   **Relevant Statutes:**
    *   **Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1080 (as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8494):** Created TIDCORP. The Court notes that only Per Diem is authorized.
    *   **Section 7 of RA 8494:** Grants the TIDCORP Board the power to fix remuneration for officers and employees of TIDCORP, but not necessarily the ex officio members of the board.
    *   **Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987:** Relates to good faith actions of Approving and Certifying officers.
    *   **Section 43 of the Administrative Code of 1987:** Solidary liability for Bad Faith actions of Approving and Certifying officers.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Original SC Decision:** Favila was held *solidarily liable* as an approving officer and recipient for the entire disallowed amount of PHP 4,539,835.02.
*   **Ruling on Motion for Reconsideration:** **Modified.** Favila is *not* liable as an approving officer because the board resolutions granting benefits predated his tenure.  He is liable *only as a recipient* for the PHP 454,598.28 he actually received, based on the principle of *solutio indebiti* (payment of what is not due).
*   **Burden of Proof:** Favila bears the burden to prove that the amounts received were genuinely for services rendered or that undue prejudice/social justice considerations warrant excusal of repayment. He failed to meet that burden here.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith:** While the SC acknowledged Favila's good faith as a recipient, it emphasizes that good faith does not excuse repayment under the *solutio indebiti* principle for benefits illegally received.
*   **Application of *Madera* Rules:** The court specifically applies the *Madera v. COA* ruling regarding the return of disallowed amounts and classifies Favila under category 2(c): recipients are liable to return unless they can demonstrate consideration for services rendered or undue prejudice/social justice considerations. The court's application of *Madera* clarified in *Abellanosa v. COA* is also important to note: the benefits must have a legal basis and a direct connection to official duties.
*   **Lack of Legal Basis:** The court reiterated its position that the Productivity Enhancement Pay, Developmental Contribution Bonuses, Corporate Guaranty, Grocery Subsidy, and Anniversary Bonuses lack legal basis, distinguishing them from legitimately authorized benefits.
*   **"Services Rendered" Argument:** The petitioner's argument that the benefits were compensation for services rendered was rejected. The SC concluded that Favila's services as an ex-officio member were already covered by his primary employment's compensation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Suratos vs. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 253584):**  Cited in the original decision; the Court held that the Board members had no right to receive additional compensation or benefits as mere ex-officio members of the Board considering that their services were already paid for and covered by the compensation attached to their principal office.
*   **Madera v. Commission on Audit (882 Phil. 744 (2020)):** Key ruling establishing the rules for the return of disallowed amounts, central to the SC's revised ruling on the Motion for Reconsideration. This case defines the liability for approving officers, certifying officers, and recipients.
*   **Abellanosa v. Commission on Audit (890 Phil. 413 (2020)):** Clarifies the exceptions under category 2(c) of the *Madera* ruling, requiring both a legal basis for the benefit and a direct link to the recipient's official functions.
*   **Lumauan v. Commission on Audit, 892 Phil. 183, 195 (2020)**
*   **Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary, 272 Phil. 147, 172 (1991)**
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 224288, September 15, 2020**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention revolved around Favila's classification as an "approving officer" and his defense of "good faith." While the SC ultimately absolved him from liability as an approving officer, his good faith did not exempt him from the obligation to return illegally received benefits under *solutio indebiti*.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted Favila's Motion for Reconsideration *in part*. He is now only liable for the PHP 454,598.28 he directly received, not the entire disallowed amount. This decision hinges on the application of the *Madera v. COA* rules, specifically regarding the liability of recipients of disallowed funds under the principle of *solutio indebiti*. The key takeaway is that even good faith recipients of illegally granted benefits may still be required to return those funds if they cannot demonstrate a legal basis for the payment or circumstances that warrant excusal under social justice or similar considerations.
