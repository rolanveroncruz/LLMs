## Legal Document Summary - *California Manufacturing Company, Inc. vs. The City of Las Piñas* (G.R. No. 178461)

**Nature:** Resolution by the Supreme Court of the Philippines approving a Joint Motion to Withdraw Petition for Review on Certiorari, effectively endorsing a compromise agreement between California Manufacturing Company, Inc. (CMCI, now owned by Unilever Philippines, Inc.) and the City of Las Piñas concerning local and real property tax assessments.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** CMCI offered, and the City of Las Piñas accepted, a compromise settlement of 50% of the assessed tax liability of P73,043,634.47, amounting to a payment of P36,522,817.24.
*   **City Resolution No. 2385-08:** The City Council of Las Piñas formally approved the compromise offer, authorizing the City Mayor and/or City Treasurer to accept the settlement and enter into a compromise agreement. The resolution also authorized the City Legal Officer to file the necessary pleading with the Supreme Court.
*   **Withdrawal of Petition:**  The Joint Motion requests the withdrawal of CMCI's Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the original tax assessments.
*   **Res Judicata Effect:** The Court explicitly states that the approved compromise agreement attains the effect and authority of *res judicata*, binding both parties. Compliance with the terms of the agreement is decreed.

**Obligations:**

*   **CMCI:** Obligated to pay the agreed-upon compromise amount of P36,522,817.24 (already fulfilled).
*   **City of Las Piñas:** Obligated to consider the debt settled upon payment of the compromise amount and issue necessary clearances, as well as cease further tax collection efforts related to the original assessment.

**Liabilities:**

*   Upon fulfillment of the agreement, CMCI is released from any further liability regarding the original tax assessments.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement:** While the resolution has the effect of res judicata, failure to fully comply by either party could lead to renewed litigation regarding enforcement of the compromise agreement, requiring further court action.
*   **Scope of Release:**  The exact scope of the release should be carefully examined.  Does it cover all potential penalties and interests related to the original assessment, or is it strictly limited to the principal amount?
*   **Unilever Liability:** While CMCI is now owned by Unilever, the specific terms of the acquisition and any assignment of liabilities should be reviewed to ensure clarity on Unilever's obligations.
*   **Validity of Original Assessment:** Although CMCI doesn't admit liability, the Supreme Court ruling does not validate nor invalidate the original tax assessments.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1306 of the Civil Code:**  Governs the validity of contracts, including compromise agreements.
*   **Article 2028 of the Civil Code:** Defines a compromise agreement.

**Contention/Ambiguity:**

The text explicitly states that CMCI does not admit liability. However, the compromise agreement and the Court's ruling effectively resolve the dispute as if liability existed, creating a potential contention point if CMCI attempts to argue the settlement was solely for expediency and not an acknowledgment of the City's claim.
