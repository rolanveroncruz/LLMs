## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Reyes (G.R. No. 157177)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming with modification the RTC decision, holding BPI liable for the return of P100,000 plus interest and damages allegedly missing from Respondent's account.

**Key Issue:** Whether Respondent Jesusa Reyes made an initial deposit of P200,000 in her new Express Teller account, or only P100,000 (fund transfer) as claimed by BPI.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA and RTC decisions, and dismissed the complaint. The Court found that the Respondents failed to prove by preponderance of evidence that they made a cash deposit of P100,000.00 in addition to the fund transfer, noting the teller's tape and altered deposit slip did not support the claim.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Article 1962, New Civil Code:** Cited by the RTC regarding the obligation of a depositary.  This is relevant to the claim that BPI failed in its duty to safely keep and return the funds.
*   **Article 1972, New Civil Code:** Cited by the RTC. Obliges the depositary to safely keep and return the deposit.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC/CA:** Initially found BPI liable for the missing P100,000, interest, moral damages (P1,000,000 reduced to P50,000), exemplary damages (P350,000), and attorney's fees (P250,000 reduced to P30,000).
*   **SC:** Reversed the liability finding, dismissing the complaint and BPI's counterclaim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Evidence:** The duplicate deposit slip (presented by the Respondent) showed P200,000, while the original (held by BPI) was altered to reflect P100,000. The ambiguity arises from whose version of the events is more credible.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC emphasized that the trial judge did not hear the witnesses firsthand, necessitating a thorough review of the transcript. This highlights the importance of witness demeanor and its impact on judicial decisions.
*   **Bank Policy Violation:** The alteration on the deposit slip was signed by the bank employee (Capati) instead of the depositor, violating bank policy. While this raised concerns about the bank's internal controls, the SC ruled that Respondents still did not establish that a deposit was made beyond what BPI acknowledged.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 1:**  Addresses burden of proof in civil cases.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 133, Sec. 1:** Addresses guidelines for determining preponderance of evidence.
*   **Preponderance of Evidence Standard:** The case revolves around whether the Respondents met this standard.
*   **Exceptions to the Finality of Factual Findings:** The SC invoked exceptions relating to manifestly mistaken inferences, speculative findings, misapprehension of facts, and overlooked relevant facts to justify reviewing the lower courts' factual findings.
*   **_Prudential Bank v. Lim_, G.R. No. 136371, November 11, 2005:** (Cited in reference to finality of facts.)
*    **_Go v. Court of Appeals_, G.R. No. 112550, February 5, 2001:** (Cited in reference to exceptions to finality.)

**Key Arguments/Evidence:**

*   **BPI:** Relied on the teller's tape, which showed the initial attempt to withdraw P200,000 was rejected due to insufficient funds, supporting their claim that only P100,000 was ultimately transferred and deposited.
*   **Reyes:** Presented the duplicate deposit slip showing P200,000 and testimony alleging a cash deposit of P100,000.00.

**Conclusion:**

The SC prioritized physical evidence (teller's tape) over testimonial evidence, finding the Respondents failed to prove the additional cash deposit of P100,000 by preponderance of evidence. The SC emphasized that the depositor's initial intent was to deposit P200,000 as shown by the teller's tape and she was aware that the balance was insufficient, thus the claim that a cash deposit of P100,000 was made was dubious. This case emphasizes the importance of robust bank record-keeping and the challenges of proving financial transactions based solely on testimonial evidence.
