Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Stephen Y. Ku v. RCBC Securities, Inc.* (G.R. No. 219491, October 17, 2018)

**Summary:**

This case concerns a complaint filed by Ku against RCBC Securities for sum of money and specific performance, alleging unauthorized trading and mismanagement of his account by RCBC Securities, Inc. through its agent, M.G. Valbuena.  The RTC initially directed a re-raffle believing it was a commercial case, then denied RCBC's Motion to Dismiss.  The Court of Appeals reversed, dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction due to the initial perceived mis-raffle and alleged insufficient docket fees.  The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision, finding that the RTC (specifically Branch 149) does have jurisdiction over the case.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC held that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the Complaint (as per *Padlan v. Sps. Dinglasan*).
*   **Nature of the Action:** The SC determined that the case is an ordinary civil action (collection of sum of money and specific performance, plus damages), not an intra-corporate dispute. The parties' relationship is defined as that of investor and securities broker.
*   **Intra-corporate Dispute Tests:** The SC applied the "relationship test" and "nature of the controversy test" from *Medical Plaza Makati Condominium Corporation v. Cullen*, finding no intra-corporate relationship as Ku is not a stockholder, partner, member or officer of RCBC Securities, Inc. Furthermore, the issues do not pertain to rights/obligations under the Corporation Code or the regulation of the corporation.
*   **RA 8799 & PD 902-A:**  The SC reiterates that RA 8799 transferred jurisdiction over cases previously under the SEC (per PD 902-A) to the RTCs (as reaffirmed in *Gonzales v. GJH Land*), and that the designation of Special Commercial Courts is procedural, not jurisdictional.  All RTCs have jurisdiction over ordinary civil cases.
*   **Docket Fees:** The SC applied the *Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion* doctrine, noting that insufficient initial docket fees do not automatically deprive the court of jurisdiction if there was no intent to defraud.  The Court found no deliberate intent to defraud the court in the payment of docket fees. The SC distinguished this case from *Manchester v. Court of Appeals*, where the complainant omitted the amount of damages sought in their prayer. The SC noted the complainant's willingness to pay the additional fees once the Court ordered him to do so. The SC references *The Heirs of the Late Ruben Reinoso, Sr. v. Court of Appeals*, to reiterate the courts willingness to relax the rule on non-payment of docket fees to ensure fair trial.
*   **Disposition:**  The Supreme Court reinstated the case in RTC Branch 149 and ordered it to proceed with the hearing.

**Obligations:**

*   RCBC Securities, Inc.:  Must defend against Ku's claims in the reinstated action.
*   Stephen Y. Ku: Obligated to pay correct docket fees.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   RCBC Securities, Inc.: Faces potential liability for unauthorized transactions, mismanagement, and damages sought by Ku.
*   Stephen Y. Ku:  Risks failing to prove his allegations and recovering the full amount claimed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The representation of MGV as a sales director and the apparent authority to transact business on behalf of RCBC Securities, Inc. is key fact, with the ultimate determination of the extent of that authority, and the responsibility of RCBC Securities, Inc. for actions taken by MGV, likely to be a major point of contention.

This summary should provide a solid foundation for understanding the key legal points of the decision.
