**Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-07-2063, RTJ-07-2064 & RTJ-07-2066 (Judge Caguioa Administrative Cases)**

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases against Judge Ramon S. Caguioa, RTC Olongapo City, Branch 74, and Sheriff Christopher T. Perez.

**Complainants:** Republic of the Philippines, Commissioner of Customs, Charles T. Burns, Jr.

**Respondents:** Judge Ramon S. Caguioa, Sheriff Christopher T. Perez

**Key Issues & Findings:**

*   **A.M. No. RTJ-07-2063 (Republic vs. Caguioa):** Judge Caguioa found guilty of **Gross Ignorance of the Law** and **Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service** for improperly issuing a writ of preliminary injunction against the implementation of Section 6 of RA 9334 (sin taxes) and failing to ensure proper due process to the republic. *See Sec. 218 NIRC on prohibition to restrain collection of Tax. Also, the Court declared that a writ of preliminary injunction requires proof of urgency and necessity and showed that applicants had no clear and unmistakable right and had an inadequate injective bond.*
    *   Violations involved: (1) enjoining tax collection, (2) inadequate injunction bond, and (3) granting intervention motions ex parte without proper service on the OSG.
    *   Relevant Case Law: *Republic v. Caguioa, G.R. No. 168584*. Court also cited *Paramount Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 369 Phil. 641, 653 (1999) and Valencia v. Court of Appeals, 331 Phil. 590, 607 (1996)* regarding injunction bonds.
*   **A.M. No. RTJ-07-2064 (Commissioner of Customs vs. Caguioa):** Judge Caguioa found guilty of **Gross Ignorance of the Law** and **Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service** for improperly issuing a writ of preliminary injunction in a mandamus case involving the reassignment of a Customs official. *See Gayacao v. Executive Secretary, 121 Phil. 729 (1965) on jurisdictional issues.*
    *   Violations involved: (1) issuing an injunction without establishing a clear legal right and (2) issuing injunction that tended to do more than maintain the status quo.
    *   The complaint by the Commissioner of Customs alleged the judge demonstrated a pattern of issuing writs without regard to territorial jurisdiction, exhaustion of administrative remedies, or proper venue as described in Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
*   **A.M. No. RTJ-07-2066 (Burns vs. Caguioa & Perez):** Judge Caguioa found guilty of **Simple Misconduct** for issuing a writ of execution to place parties in possession of property when the underlying decision (dismissal due to prescription) did not adjudicate possessory rights. *See Unson v. Lacson 112 Phil. 752 (1961) and Perez v. Evite, 111 Phil. 564 (1961) regarding judgement.*
    *   The Court of Appeals found, in CA-GR SP No. 93025 that a Writ of Execution must substantially conform to the dispositive portion of the promulgated decision. The writ cannot vary or go beyond the terms of the judgment.
    *   Sheriff Perez found not liable, as he was merely executing a court order.
*   **Defense:** Judge Caguioa argued his errors were mere errors of judgment, not motivated by bad faith or corruption, invoking public policy and jurisprudence protecting judges from liability for good faith errors.

**Penalties:**

*   **Judge Caguioa:**
    *   A.M. No. RTJ-07-2066: Suspended from office without pay for three months.
    *   A.M. Nos. RTJ-07-2063 & RTJ-07-2064: Dismissed from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits (except leave credits).
*   **Sheriff Perez:** Complaint dismissed.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9334 (Sin Tax Law)
*   Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7227 (Bases Conversion and Development Act)
*   National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, Section 131
*   Rules of Court, Rule 65, Section 4 (Mandamus venue)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 58, Section 4(b) (Injunction Bond)
*   Administrative Matter No. 01-8-10-SC (Amendment to Rule 140 â€“ Discipline of Judges)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Pattern of Improvident Injunctions:** The Solicitor's affidavit highlights a pattern of Judge Caguioa issuing injunctions that are later overturned, suggesting a disregard for legal standards and potentially raising questions of competence or bias.
*   **Reliance on "Good Faith" Defense:** Judge Caguioa's defense hinges on demonstrating the absence of bad faith or corruption. However, the Court found Gross Ignorance of the Law despite this argument, indicating that repeated, significant errors can warrant discipline even without proof of malice.
*   **Impact of Dismissal:** Judge Caguioa's dismissal, coupled with the forfeiture of retirement benefits, represents a significant professional consequence. He may pursue further appeals.
*   **Ministerial Duty of Sheriff:** While Sheriff Perez was exonerated, the case underscores the importance of sheriffs scrutinizing writs for facial validity and refusing to execute patently unlawful orders, to avoid potential liability.
