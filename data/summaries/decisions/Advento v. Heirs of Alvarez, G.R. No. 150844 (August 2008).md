## Legal Document Summary - *Adviento v. Heirs of Alvarez* (G.R. No. 150844, August 20, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which affirmed the RTC's annulment of OCT No. 338 and subsequent titles, reconveying a 228 sq. m. parcel of land to the Heirs of Miguel Alvarez.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Annulment of Title:** The RTC ordered the annulment of OCT No. 338 in the name of Lydia Gaya and its subsequent titles (TCT 13200 to Fidel Cu, TCT 15201 to Ceferino Adviento) insofar as it covers the disputed 228 sq. m. land.
*   **Ownership:** The RTC declared the Heirs of Miguel Alvarez as the rightful owners and entitled to possession of the disputed land.
*   **Damages:** The RTC ordered Lydia Gaya to pay attorney's fees and costs of suit to the Heirs of Miguel Alvarez.

**Obligations:**

*   Ceferino Adviento (and predecessors in interest) are obligated to relinquish possession of the 228 sq. m. land to the Heirs of Miguel Alvarez.
*   Lydia Gaya is obligated to pay attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   The basis for the adverse ruling against Gaya stems from the fact that fraudulent activity was committed when registering the land.
*   Because of this, Adviento as her successor-in-interest also inherited Gaya's liabilities.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** The ruling essentially allows a collateral attack on OCT No. 338, despite registration under the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496). The court relies on Section 38 of Act No. 496, which provides an exception for fraud in procuring the decree of registration.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The court emphasizes the lack of notice to Miguel Alvarez during the original land registration proceedings initiated by Gaya. This lack of notice is deemed a denial of due process and a basis for the fraud finding.
*   **Bona Fide Purchaser Status:** Adviento's claim to be a *bona fide* purchaser for value is rejected due to the annotation of lis pendens on Gaya's title and his knowledge of the pending legal challenge before his purchase.
*   **Accretion Issue:** Adviento's argument regarding riparian ownership and the presence of a road bordering the river is deemed raised for the first time on appeal and is therefore not considered.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 496 (Land Registration Act):** The core statute governing land registration. Sections 21 and 38 are particularly relevant.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Superseded Act No. 496, but Act No. 496 was the law in effect at the time of the original land registration proceedings.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141:** Cited by Gaya as the basis for the confirmation of her imperfect title.
*   **Republic v. Heirs of Luisa Villa Abrille (L-39248, May 7, 1976, 71 SCRA 57):** Outlines the requisites for original registration under Act 496.
*   **Salomon v. Bocauto (71 Phil. 363):** Discusses the burden of proof in petitions for review under Section 38 of Act No. 496.
*   **Libundan v. Gil (G.R. No. L-21163, May 17, 1972, 45 SCRA 17):** Defines extrinsic fraud.
*   **J.M. Tuason v. Court of Appeals (No. L-41233, 21 November 1979, 94 SCRA 413):** States that a purchaser with knowledge of a defect in the vendor's title cannot claim good faith.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 1:** No person shall be deprived of property without due process of law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "fraud" is key to the case. The court relies on extrinsic fraud, specifically the lack of notice to Alvarez, to justify the annulment. This is contentious because mere lack of notice doesn't always equate to extrinsic fraud; there must be a deliberate attempt to conceal the proceedings from the adverse party.
*   Judicial Admission vs. Proof of Ownership: The Court distinguishes between taking judicial notice of the existence of a title and the facts proving indisputable ownership.

**Overall Assessment:** The court prioritized the principle of due process and the prevention of fraud over the indefeasibility of a registered title. The decision hinges on the finding of extrinsic fraud in the original land registration proceedings due to the lack of notice to Alvarez, and the failure of Adviento to qualify as a *bona fide* purchaser. The case presents challenges to the usual sanctity of Torrens titles when fraud is proven.
