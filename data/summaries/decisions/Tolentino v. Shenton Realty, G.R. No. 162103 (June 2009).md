## Legal Document Summary: *Tolentino v. Shenton Realty Corp.*, G.R. No. 162103

**Nature:** Petition for Review of RTC Resolutions denying Motion to Intervene and ordering Writ of Possession in extrajudicial foreclosure proceeding (LRC Case No. MC-03-237).

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner (Tolentino) defaulted on a loan secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   Respondent (Shenton) purchased the property at an extrajudicial foreclosure sale under Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118. Certificate of Sale registered 7 February 2001.
*   Petitioner filed an action for judicial redemption prior to the expiration of the one-year redemption period, but failed to consign the redemption price.
*   Respondent filed Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession, which the RTC granted despite Petitioner's Motion to Intervene.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Act 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure):** Governs the foreclosure sale process and redemption rights.  Section 6 dictates the one-year redemption period and incorporation of Rule 39, Section 28 ROC.
*   **Rule 39, Section 28 ROC (Redemption):** Specifies requirements for redemption, including payment of purchase price, interest, and assessments.
*   **Section 7, Act 3135:** Mandates issuance of writ of possession to purchaser after consolidation of ownership, *De los Reyes v. CA* jurisprudence dictates ministerial duty for judge, with no trial required.
*   **Obligation to Consign Redemption Price:**  Central issue; *Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* cited, emphasizing the necessity of timely redemption, good faith, and prompt full payment.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Failure to Consign:** Primary reason for the denial of the petition.  Her failure to tender the redemption price creates a significant risk of losing the property.
*   **Validity of Corporate Authorization:**  Initial deficiency in showing authority to sign the verification was cured by subsequent submission of a Secretary's Certificate. Risk mitigated.
*   **Irreversible Action:**  Even with a TRO issued by the Supreme Court, the Sheriff executed the writ of possession prior to receipt of notification, a fact impacting the effectiveness of future remedies.
*   **Risk of Eviction:** Since a writ of possession has been issued, Petitioner is at immediate risk of eviction.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Act 3135, as amended:** Governing statute.
*   **Rule 39, Section 28 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs redemptions.
*   ***Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Outlines the requirements for valid judicial redemption.  Filing an action is insufficient without tendering or consigning the redemption price. *Tolentino v. Court of Appeals* reiterates this.
*   ***De los Reyes v. CA*:** Judge has no discretion to deny writ of possession once the requirements under Section 7 are met.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around whether a complaint for judicial redemption filed *within* the redemption period is sufficient when there is no simultaneous or subsequent consignation of the redemption price.  The Court's emphasis on *Hi-Yield Realty* suggests that mere filing is insufficient.

**Conclusion:**

The Petitioner's case is weak. The crucial issue is the failure to consign the redemption price.  While the complaint for judicial redemption was filed on time, the lack of consignation is fatal to her claim, making it highly probable the purchaser will retain possession and ownership of the property. Petitioner must take immediate steps to address this deficiency if any avenues for recourse remain, potentially seeking an accounting and tendering the full redemption amount.
