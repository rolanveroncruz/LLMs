## Legal Document Summary: Corinthian Gardens Assn. v. Tanjangco, et al. (G.R. No. 160795)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision finding Corinthian negligent and liable for a portion of damages due to encroachment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Encroachment:** Cuasos' perimeter fence encroached on Tanjangcos' land (Lot 69) by 87 square meters.
*   **Corinthian's Role:** Corinthian approved Cuasos' building plans and conducted periodic inspections.
*   **Manual of Rules and Regulations:** Corinthian's Manual requires plan approval and allows sanctions for violations.
*   **Third-Party Complaint:** Cuasos filed a third-party complaint against Corinthian, C.B. Paraz, and Engr. De Dios.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Cuasos:** Liable to Tanjangcos for the encroachment, now with a final and executory judgment against them for acting in bad faith (they did not appeal CA decision). Obligated to pay rentals, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **C.B. Paraz & Engr. De Dios:** Liable for a percentage of Cuasos' obligations as well (they did not appeal CA decision)
*   **Corinthian:** Held liable by the CA for 5% of the total judgment sums and amounts due from Cuasos to Tanjangcos, plus interest. Basis of liability is negligence in approving the building plans despite the encroachment, and for failing to adequately inspect the construction, despite its own Manual of Rules and Regulations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Corinthian:** Risk of paying 5% of the total damages awarded to Tanjangcos. Sets a precedent for liability based on negligent plan approval, potentially increasing the association's exposure to similar claims.
*   **Cuasos:** Face demolition of perimeter fence and payment of significant damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Basis for the tort claim (quasi-delict).
*   **Articles 449, 450, 451 and 549, New Civil Code:** Rights of Tanjangcos as landowners upon finding of bad faith on the part of the Cuasos.
*   **Spouses Badillo v. Tayag (448 Phil. 606):** Regarding judicial notice of reasonable rent.
*   **Spouses Catungal v. Hao (407 Phil. 309):** Regarding increase in award of rentals considering circumstances of the case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Table Inspection" vs. Actual Inspection:** Corinthian's argument that its approval process only involved "table inspections" and not actual site measurements was rejected by the CA. This is contentious as it relates to the standard of care expected of homeowners associations in approving building plans.
*   **Builder's Bond:** Corinthian accepted a builder's bond but argued it wasn't liable for the encroachment. The CA rejected this argument, indicating that accepting the bond implies a responsibility for ensuring proper construction.
*   **Increase in Rent:** The CA unilaterally increased the rent amount from P2,000 to P10,000, a point of contention for Corinthian given the lack of explicit prayer for this amount in the initial complaint.

**Overall Assessment:**

The CA decision, now upheld by the Supreme Court, expands the liability of homeowners associations for negligent approval of building plans. The ruling emphasizes the association's duty to enforce its own rules and regulations to protect the interests of all its members. Corinthian's attempt to limit its liability by claiming the approval was a mere formality was rejected. The case suggests that homeowners associations should exercise due diligence in reviewing building plans and conducting inspections to ensure compliance with regulations and avoid potential liability for encroachments and other construction-related issues. It is important to note that because neither Cuasos, C.B. Paraz, or Engr. De Dios appealed the CA Decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that its review was limited to the issues raised by Corinthian and any relief granted would apply only to Corinthian.
