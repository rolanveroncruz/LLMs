**Case Summary: Roque v. Court of Appeals, CSC, et al. G.R. No. 179245 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Civil Service Commission (CSC) resolutions that upheld the dismissal of Petitioner Rash C. Roque (Regional Director, BFP-NCR) from public service for grave misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Procurement Anomaly:** The case centers around irregularities in the procurement of supplies for the BFP-NCR's Fourth Quarter of CY 2002. Allegations include:

    *   Non-compliance with procurement laws and rules
    *   Falsified bidding process (no actual bidding)
    *   Directing PBAC members to sign resolutions.
    *   Failure to notify COA of the bidding.
    *   Overpricing of supplies (estimated at P1,067,025.50)
    *   Payment for undelivered or withdrawn supplies.
    *   Suppression of Evidence (Memorandums countermanding investigation directives).
*   **Petitioner's Actions:**
    *   Approved awards and issued Notices of Award to bidders.
    *   Approved disbursement vouchers without the required certification of funds availability from the Regional Accountant.
    *   Issued memorandums countermanding orders to district fire marshals, essentially suppressing evidence.

**Obligations:**

*   Adherence to procurement laws, rules, and regulations, including those requiring certification of fund availability.
*   Obligation of the Regional Director to ensure compliance with proper procedures in procurement.
*   Compliance with lawful orders from superiors (Fire Chief, DILG Secretary).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Grave Misconduct, resulting in dismissal from service.
*   **Accessory Penalties:** Perpetual disqualification from re-entering government service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (excluding leave credits), and cancellation of Civil Service eligibility.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Due Process Claim:** The petitioner argued a denial of due process. The Court found against this argument, noting opportunities were afforded to Roque to be heard by filing an answer in the lower courts and failing to submit an answer or appear to any of the scheduled preliminary conferences despite receiving due notice.

*   **Grave Misconduct Finding:** The Court upheld the finding of grave misconduct based on:

    *   Approval of disbursement vouchers without proper certification of fund availability.
    *   Intent to disregard procurement regulations as evidenced by multiple improper voucher approvals.
    *   Disobeying lawful orders from his superiors, this being classified as gross insubordination.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code of 1991, General Appropriations Act, and pertinent procurement laws and rules:** Relate to the legal basis for proper procurement procedures and fund availability certification.
*   **Sec. 22, Rule IV of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations:** Defines grave misconduct and its corresponding penalty of dismissal.
*   **Dadulo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 175451, April 13, 2007, 521 SCRA 357:** For the rule that the uniform findings of fact by the CSC and Court of Appeals are conclusive.
*   **Civil Service Commission v. Ledesma, G.R. No. 154521, September 30, 2005.:** Defines misconduct.
*   **Igoy v. Soraino, A.M. No. 2001-9-SC, July 14, 2005, 495 SCRA 1.:** Defines the penalties of dismissal from service, including what will be forfeited.

**Ambiguities & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Petitioner's "Good Faith" Defense:** The petitioner claimed good faith in approving disbursement vouchers, despite the absence of necessary certifications. The courts rejected this, emphasizing his duty to verify compliance and the apparent pattern of disregard.
*   **Countermanding Orders:** The Court relied heavily on the fact that Roque issued memorandums countermanding directives to his subordinates to stop or hold in abeyance compliance with the order from his superior.

**Note:** The outcome hinges on the substantial evidence presented against the petitioner. The failure to adhere to established rules and procedures in procurement, coupled with the attempts to suppress the investigation, were key factors.
