**Case Summary: *Ambagan v. People***

**Citation:** G.R. Nos. 233443-44, November 28, 2018 (844 Phil. 270)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Issue:** Whether Mayor Ambagan is guilty of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for causing undue injury to landowners by ordering construction on their properties for the Balite Falls eco-tourism project.

**Ruling:**  Partially Meritorious. SC affirmed guilty verdict but modified the Sandiganbayan's decision to reflect *one* count of violation, rather than two. The Court awarded temperate damages to each property owner.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Prohibits public officers from causing undue injury to any party or giving unwarranted benefits through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence in the discharge of official functions.
*   **Elements of Section 3(e) Violation:**
    1.  Accused is a public officer.
    2.  Acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence.
    3.  Action caused undue injury or gave unwarranted benefit.
*   **Obligation:** Public officers have a duty to respect private property rights and to ensure that actions taken for public projects comply with legal requirements, including expropriation proceedings when necessary.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Ambagan found guilty of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
    *   **Penalty:** Imprisonment of 6 years and 1 month (minimum) to 10 years (maximum), perpetual disqualification from public office.
*   **Civil Liability:** Payment of temperate damages of Php 400,000.00 to each property owner (Heirs of Simplicia Lumandas and Calixto Lumandas) with 6% interest per annum from finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delito Continuado (Continuous Crime):**  The Court ruled that the actions, although impacting two landowners, constituted a single continuing crime due to the singularity of purpose (Balite Falls project) and the proximity in time and manner of commission. *Santiago v. Garchitorena* is cited to define and illustrate this concept. *Gamboa v CA* distinguishes this from complex crimes. This determination significantly reduced the potential sentencing exposure.
*   **Evident Bad Faith:** The court found evident bad faith by the mayor in proceeding with construction despite landowners objections and without proper expropriation.
*   **Undue Injury:**  Established through the "taking" of portions of the landowners' properties for the Balite Falls project, even though the landowners allegedly received some benefit from the development. *Roberto P. Fuentes v. People* reiterates that proof of the extent of damage is not essential.
*   **Lack of Expropriation:**  Failure to initiate expropriation proceedings before commencing construction was a critical factor in establishing the violation of RA 3019. The SB resolution approving guidelines for the ecotourism area does not substitute for proper expropriation.
*   **Damages:** While compensatory damages were not awarded due to lack of valuation proof, the Supreme Court *motu proprio* awarded temperate damages, invoking the principle that an appeal in a criminal case opens the entire case for review.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Revised Penal Code Article 48:** Complex Crimes
*   **Gamboa v. CA:** Definition of "delito continuado" and its distinction from complex crimes.
*   **Santiago v. Hon. Justice Garchitorena:** Detailed discussion of "delito continuado" and examples.
*   **People v. Tumlos, People v. Jaranillo, People v. De Leon, People v. Sabbun, People v. Lawas:** Examples cited in *Santiago v. Garchitorena* where *delito continuado* was applied
*   **People v. Dichupa, People v. Cid, People v. Ledesma, Gamboa v. Court of Appeals:** Examples cited in *Santiago v. Garchitorena* where *delito continuado* was *not* applied
*   **Roberto P. Fuentes v. People of the Philippines:**  Proof of extent of damage not essential.
*   **Act No. 4103:** The Indeterminate Sentence Law

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Informations only alleged the mayor was "acting in relation to his office." This was challenged as insufficiently alleging the act was "in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions," but the court found the allegation sufficient.
*   The definition of "undue injury" and the need for proof of actual pecuniary loss was a point of contention.  The court clarified that substantial injury, not merely negligible, is sufficient.

**Legal Advice Implications:**

*   This case highlights the risks associated with proceeding with public projects on private land without proper legal process, particularly expropriation.
*   The *delito continuado* ruling could be relevant in future cases involving similar fact patterns, potentially limiting the number of charges and the overall severity of sentencing.
*   The award of temperate damages *motu proprio* demonstrates the Supreme Court's willingness to address perceived injustices even when the parties have not fully presented their case on damages.
