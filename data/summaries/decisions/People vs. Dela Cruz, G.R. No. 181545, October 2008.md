## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Dela Cruz*, G.R. No. 181545 (2008)

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Mark Dela Cruz for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (illegal sale of *shabu*). The Court acquitted Dela Cruz due to reasonable doubt stemming from a compromised chain of custody of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Illegal sale of 0.08 grams of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer (PO2 Amoyo).
*   **Defense:** Alibi, denial, and questioning the integrity/identity of the *shabu*.
*   **Core Issue:** Whether the prosecution established an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, specifically regarding marking, handling, and laboratory examination.
*   **Section 21 of R.A. 9165 Compliance:** The main point of contention. The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove compliance with the procedural requirements concerning the handling and disposition of confiscated drugs (inventory, photography, presence of required witnesses).
*   **Chain of Custody Breakdown:** The Court noted inconsistencies in the testimony regarding when and where the markings were placed on the sachets. A gap existed between the receipt of the evidence by SPO4 Tabayag from PO2 Amoyo and the delivery to the PNP Crime Laboratory, and SPO4 Tabayag was not questioned about markings.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** To prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, including the integrity and identity of the corpus delicti (the seized drugs), as required by Section 21 of R.A. 9165.
*   **Potential Liability of Police Officers:** While not explicitly stated, the Court's criticism of the handling of evidence implies a potential liability for failure to follow proper procedures under R.A. 9165, impacting the integrity of evidence.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Insufficient Compliance with Section 21:** Failure to immediately mark, inventory, and photograph the seized drugs in the presence of the accused and required witnesses creates a significant risk of reasonable doubt.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The court clarifies that the presumption of regularity afforded to police officers in the performance of their duties *cannot* override the constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent, particularly when irregularities are present in the handling of evidence.
*   **"Corpus Delicti" Determination:** The court cites instances where the integrity of the *corpus delicti* was compromised in similar cases because of lapses in handling procedures. This calls into question the validity of evidence obtained from the Defendant.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II:** The substantive law violated, prohibiting illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21:** The procedural law governing the custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   ***Lopez v. People***: Discussed chain of custody rule, emphasizing unbroken chain of custody is essential, especially with evidence easily altered or tampered.
*   ***People v. Orteza, People v. Laxa, People v. Kimura, Zarraga v. People***: Failure to comply with procedures in custody of seized drugs raises doubt as to origins.
*   ***People v. Nazareno***: Equivalent failure to present PO that made markings means failure to prove existence of *corpus delicti*.
*   ***People v. Santos , Jr.***: Failure to observe procedure negates the presumption of regularity.
*   ***People v. Ca√±ete***: The presumption of regularity cannot prevail over the constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent.

**Legal Advice:**

This case highlights the critical importance of meticulously adhering to Section 21 of R.A. 9165 in drug cases. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures, especially regarding the immediate marking, inventory, and witnessing of the seizure, can create reasonable doubt and lead to acquittal, regardless of the apparent strength of the prosecution's case. Law enforcement agencies and prosecutors must ensure strict compliance with these requirements to secure convictions.
