## Legal Document Summary: *Eduardo M. Tomada, Sr. vs. RFM Corporation-Bakery Flour Division and Jose Maria Concepcion III* (G.R. No. 163270, September 11, 2009)

**Case Summary:**

This Supreme Court case affirms the validity of Eduardo M. Tomada, Sr.'s (Petitioner) dismissal by RFM Corporation-Bakery Flour Division (Respondent) for serious misconduct. The court reverses the Court of Appeals' decision to grant separation pay, holding that Tomada's actions demonstrated a lack of loyalty and disregard for company rules.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Just Cause for Termination:** The Court found just cause for termination under Article 282 of the Labor Code due to "serious misconduct."
*   **Misconduct Defined:** Tomada's act of sleeping on the job and being away from his assigned post without authorization constituted a serious transgression of company rules, a dereliction of duty, and showed him unfit to continue working.
*   **Factual Basis:** Based on findings by the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and Court of Appeals, the Court affirmed that Tomada was found sleeping during his shift in an area outside his assigned post while a fire broke out in his assigned area. He did not effectively rebut the findings and was not authorized to troubleshoot in the areas he claimed to have been working in.
*   **Denial of Separation Pay:** The Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision granting separation pay, holding that Tomada's serious misconduct demonstrated a lack of concern for his employer and did not warrant financial assistance.
*   **Corporate Liability:** The case clarifies corporate liability, affirming the principle that a corporate officer cannot be held jointly and severally liable with the corporation without a showing of malice or bad faith. (RFM Corporation held liable instead of Jose Maria Concepcion III).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employee Duty:** Employees have a duty to adhere to company rules and act with loyalty and diligence.
*   **Employer Right to Discipline:** Employers have the right to discipline employees for serious misconduct related to their duties.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Serious Misconduct":** While the Court upheld the finding of serious misconduct based on specific facts, the determination of what constitutes "serious misconduct" can be subjective and fact-dependent. *Stanford Microsystems, Inc. v. NLRC, 241 Phil. 426 (1988)*
*   **Mitigation of Penalty based on Length of Service:** The Court rejected the argument that length of service should mitigate the penalty, but length of service can sometimes be a factor considered by lower courts. *Aromin v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 164824, 30 April 2008, 553 SCRA 273.*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The burden of proof in labor cases generally rests on the employer to prove the validity of the dismissal.
