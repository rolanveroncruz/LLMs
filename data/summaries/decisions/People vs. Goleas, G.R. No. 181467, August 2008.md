**Case Summary: *People v. Goleas and Lacaba*, G.R. No. 181467 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Ambrosio Goleas and Alvin Lacaba for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:** Appellants Goleas and Lacaba were charged with murder for the stabbing death of Jerry Lobos. Prosecution's key witness, Javier, testified he saw Lacaba hold Lobos while Goleas stabbed him. The victim, before dying, identified "Leo" (later clarified as Goleas) as an assailant. The defense presented alibis, which were rejected by the trial court.

**RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Murder, sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*, and ordered to pay damages.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision *in toto*.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines Murder and its corresponding penalties.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The central qualifying circumstance that elevates the killing to murder. The CA and RTC found treachery present, satisfying the two-pronged test: (1) employment of means ensuring execution without risk to the offender and (2) deliberate choice of said means. Specifically, Lacaba holding Lobosâ€™s arms constituted treachery. The defense argued against treachery, claiming the crime was in broad daylight and the victim saw the attackers, but the SC rejected this.
*   **Evident Premeditation & Abuse of Superior Strength:** Alleged in the information, but the Court properly disregarded both. The Court correctly found that evident premeditation could not be appreciated as there was no proof of: (1) the time when the offender was determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to his resolve; and (3) a sufficient interval of time between the determination or conception and the execution of the crime. Abuse of superior strength was deemed absorbed by treachery.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The defense challenged the credibility of eyewitness Javier. The Court upheld the trial court's assessment, citing settled principles: deference to trial court findings, opportunity to observe demeanor, and clear and positive testimony. *People v. Galido* (2004) is cited.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** A single, credible witness's testimony can support a conviction, even for murder. *Mendoza v. People* (2007) cited.
*   **Damages:** The court upheld the awarding of P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, P21,000 as actual damages, and P25,000 as exemplary damages.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision. Goleas and Lacaba were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellants are obligated to serve their sentences of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellants are jointly and severally liable for P21,000 actual damages, P50,000 moral damages, P50,000 civil indemnity, and P25,000 exemplary damages to the heirs of Jerry Lobos.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for murder.
*   Civil liability for damages resulting from the crime.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main risk for the appellants is the affirmed conviction and continued incarceration.
*   While the decision is seemingly sound, future legal challenges may arise if new evidence surfaces or if a different interpretation of existing evidence can be argued effectively.
*   There are no overtly ambiguous clauses in the original court decisions.
