**Case Summary: Alejandrino v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 114151, September 17, 1998**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a trial court's order for segregation of property after a judgment for quieting of title had become final.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Alejandrino died, leaving a 219 sqm lot (Lot No. 2798) to their six children.
*   Heirs did not formally settle the estate.
*   Petitioner Mauricia Alejandrino allegedly purchased shares of Gregorio, Ciriaco, and Abundio, totaling 97.43 sqm including her own share.
*   Private respondent Licerio Nique purchased shares from Laurencia, Gregorio (through Laurencia), Abundio (through Laurencia), and Marcelino, totaling 121.67 sqm.
*   Laurencia filed an action for quieting of title (Civil Case No. CEB-7038) against Nique, which was decided in favor of Nique, declaring him the owner of Laurencia's, Marcelino's, Gregorio's, and Abundio's shares (totaling 146 sqm). Laurencia withdrew her appeal, making the decision final.
*   Mauricia then filed an action for redemption and recovery of properties (Civil Case No. CEB-11673) against Nique, asserting her right to redeem Nique's purchased shares.
*   Nique moved for the segregation of the 146 sqm declared his in Civil Case No. CEB-7038. The trial court granted the motion.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s order for segregation.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 1078, Civil Code:**  Estate owned in common by heirs before partition.
*   **Article 493, Civil Code:** Co-owner's right to alienate their pro-indiviso share, limited to the portion allotted in the final division.
*   **Article 1088, Civil Code:** Right of co-heirs to be subrogated to a stranger's purchase of hereditary rights within one month of written notification of sale by the vendor, by reimbursing the price of the sale.
*   **Rule 74, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Requirements for extrajudicial settlement of estate (public instrument, filing with Register of Deeds, publication).
*   **Article 1082, Civil Code:** Any act intended to end indivision among co-heirs is deemed a partition, regardless of the form.
*   **Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement:** An unnotarized deed between Mauricia and Laurencia dividing the land, with Laurencia owning 146 sqm in the frontage and Mauricia 73 sqm in the back.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Risk of Invalid Partition:** The Court acknowledges that the property was not formally partitioned according to the Rules of Court.
*   **Challenge to Extrajudicial Settlement:**  Petitioner challenged the validity of the extrajudicial settlement due to lack of notarization and publication.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Bailon-Casilao vs. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 78178, April 15, 1988, 160 SCRA 738, 745):**  Sale of entire property by one co-owner without consent only transfers the seller's rights, making the buyer a co-owner. The proper action is division of the common property.
*   **Mercado v. Court of Appeals, 310 Phil. 684, 690 (1995):** Reiterates the principle of Bailon-Casilao.

**Ambiguous and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Extrajudicial Settlement:**  The document was not notarized or published, which are typical requirements. However, the Court held that these are not essential for validity *between the parties*, citing the intent to partition as sufficient.
*   **Trial Court's Order for Segregation:**  The trial court ordered segregation based on the extrajudicial settlement in an action for quieting of title, which typically does not involve partition. The Court rationalized this as clarification of the prior judgment and recognition of the existing partition between Mauricia and Laurencia.

**Key Holdings:**

*   Co-owner can alienate their pro-indiviso share of the inherited property.
*   Despite the lack of formal partition, the extrajudicial settlement between Mauricia and Laurencia, even if unnotarized, evidenced their intent to partition and validly transferred ownership of specific portions.
*   The trial court's order for segregation was upheld as a clarification of the prior judgment and a recognition of the existing partition.
*   No forum shopping was found because the parties and causes of action were not identical between the quieting of title case and the action for redemption.

**Potential Issues for Future Litigation:**

*   **Rights of other heirs:**  The validity of the sale only affects the rights of those who sold their rights to Licerio. What about the others that never sold their rights?
*   **Validity of the unnotarized extrajudicial settlement against third parties:**  The Court held the extrajudicial settlement was valid as to the parties (Mauricia and Laurencia) but did not explicitly address its enforceability against other third parties who may have an interest in the property.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court upheld the segregation order, effectively recognizing a partition based on an unnotarized extrajudicial settlement between two heirs. This decision emphasizes substance over form in recognizing the intent to partition, potentially impacting future disputes involving informal estate settlements. Future litigation might arise regarding the rights of other heirs or the enforceability of the unnotarized settlement against third parties not privy to the agreement.
