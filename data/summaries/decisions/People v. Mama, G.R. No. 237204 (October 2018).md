Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Saidamen Olimpain Mama*, G.R. No. 237204, October 1, 2018

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Saidamen Olimpain Mama for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Mama was charged with selling 4.57 grams and possessing 49.89 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in Muntinlupa City.
*   **Buy-bust Operation:** Police officers conducted a buy-bust operation based on information from an asset. SPO2 de Lima acted as the poseur-buyer. Mama allegedly sold shabu to de Lima, and a subsequent search revealed additional sachets of shabu in his possession.
*   **Defense:** Mama denied the charges, claiming armed men barged into his house, demanded money, and planted evidence.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Mama guilty, sentencing him to life imprisonment and fines for both charges. The court believed the prosecution established the elements of the crimes and that the integrity of the *corpus delicti* was maintained.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC conviction. It found the prosecution's witnesses credible and held that the absence of required witnesses during inventory wasn't fatal if the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.

**Issue:** Whether Mama is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11 of RA 9165.

**Court's Ruling:**  Appeal GRANTED; CA decision REVERSED; Mama ACQUITTED.

**Rationale:**

*   **Chain of Custody Failure:** The Court found unjustified deviations from the prescribed chain of custody rule outlined in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, which compromises the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   **Witness Requirement Non-Compliance:**  The inventory lacked signatures of required witnesses (elected public official, DOJ representative, media representative). The police officer's testimony revealed a lax attitude toward complying with Section 21, particularly the witness requirement.
*   **Lack of Justification:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with the witness requirement or to demonstrate earnest efforts to secure the presence of those witnesses. Citing *People v. Umipang*, a "flimsy excuse" such as mere statements of unavailability is not sufficient.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court emphasized that the State bears the burden of proving compliance with Section 21 and the integrity of the *corpus delicti*. Failure to do so results in the accused's acquittal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002): Illegal Sale & Possession.
*   RA 10640: Amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165.

*   *People v. Almorfe*, 631 Phil. 51 (2010): Prosecution must explain procedural lapses and demonstrate that the integrity of the seized evidence was preserved.
*   *People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637 (2010): Justifiable grounds for non-compliance must be proven as a fact.
*   *People v. Umipang*, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012): Prosecution must show "earnest efforts" to contact required witnesses.
*   *People v. Crispo*, G.R. No. 230065, March 14, 2018: Reiterates police officers must convince the Court they exerted earnest efforts to comply with Section 21.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The primary risk is the acquittal of a drug offender due to procedural lapses in handling evidence.
*   The vagueness of what constitutes "justifiable grounds" for non-compliance with Section 21 continues to be a source of litigation. Courts are increasingly requiring significant evidence of effort to comply.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Law enforcement has a strict obligation to comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 (as amended) to maintain the chain of custody and integrity of drug evidence.
*   Prosecutors have a positive duty to prove compliance with Section 21 and justify any deviations.  Failure to do so can lead to acquittal.

This case reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases. The Court's emphasis on the witness requirement and the need for "earnest efforts" to secure the presence of witnesses serves as a strong warning against procedural shortcuts.
