## Legal Document Summary: *Eusebio v. Luis*, G.R. No. 162474

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's decision affirming the RTC judgment regarding taking of private property for public use without proper expropriation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Taking:** The City of Pasig took possession of respondents' land in 1980 for a municipal road (A. Sandoval Avenue) without expropriation proceedings.
*   **Resolution No. 15 & 93-13:** City council authorized payments (Res. No. 15), but the Appraisal Committee assessed a low value (P150/sqm, Res. No. 93-13).
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Respondents demanded P5,000/sqm as just compensation based on prior payments for similar properties.
*   **RTC Decision:** Declared the taking illegal, ordering return of property with rentals, or, if impossible, payment of P7,930,000 (P5,000/sqm) plus rental, plus attorney's fees.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC.
*   **SC Ruling:** Partially granted the petition, modifying the CA decision.

**Obligations:**

*   **City of Pasig:** Obligated to institute expropriation proceedings for the land within 15 days of finality of the SC decision.
*   **City of Pasig:** Obligated to pay just compensation to respondents based on the fair market value *at the time of the taking (1980)*, plus legal interest (6% per annum) from taking until full payment. (See *Manila International Airport Authority v. Rodriguez*).
*   **City of Pasig:** Obligated to pay exemplary damages (P200,000) and attorney's fees (P200,000).

**Liabilities:**

*   **City of Pasig:** Primarily liable for the taking and damages.
*   **Individual Petitioners (Eusebio, Bernardo, Endriga):**  Not held personally liable due to lack of evidence of involvement in the initial taking or that they were in office at the time.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Date:** The valuation *must* be determined as of 1980, when the land was taken.  The record lacks evidence on this value, requiring further fact-finding during the expropriation proceedings.  The City has a significant incentive to argue for a low valuation, given the lengthy delay.
*   **Expropriation Proceeding Timeline:**  The SC sets a 15-day deadline for the City to initiate expropriation, but delays are likely.  Respondents should actively monitor and enforce compliance.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The interest calculation begins "from the time of taking". Accurately documenting the precise date of the taking is essential for calculation purposes.
*   **"Just Compensation" Definition:** The determination of "just compensation" is subjective and contentious, requiring appointment of commissioners as stated in Forfom to assess the value of the land in 1980. (*Forfom Development Corporation v. Philippine National Railways*; *National Power Corporation v. Dela Cruz*).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 9, Article III, Constitution:**  Guarantees just compensation for private property taken for public use.
*   **Rule 67, Sections 5 & 6, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Procedure for eminent domain and appointment of commissioners to determine just compensation.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals:** Addresses prescription in land recovery and importance of just compensation.
*   **Forfom Development Corporation v. Philippine National Railways:** Addresses estoppel for prolonged silence, valuation guidelines and procedure for just compensation.
*   **Manila International Airport Authority v. Rodriguez:** Addresses the valuation date and remedies for illegal takings, particularly interest and exemplary damages.  This is central to the damage award.
*   **Republic v. Lara; Ansaldo v. Tantuico, Jr.; Republic v. Garcellano:** Reinforces valuation date and proper compensation forms.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact date of the "taking" in 1980 is not precisely defined.
*   The criteria the commissioners use to determine land value from 1980 is not defined, therefore leaving a door open to be argued.

**Overall Analysis:**

The ruling is a partial victory for the landowners. While they will not recover the land itself, they are entitled to just compensation, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. The City is ordered to commence expropriation proceedings to determine just compensation, with emphasis on valuation *at the time of the taking* (1980). The key battleground will be the valuation process. Respondents need to be prepared to present strong evidence of land values in that specific location in 1980 and advocate for a fair application of expropriation law.
