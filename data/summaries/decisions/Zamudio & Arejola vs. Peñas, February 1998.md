## Summary of *Zamudio vs. Peñas, Jr.* (A.M. No. RTJ-95-1332 & A.M. No. RTJ-98-1398)

This Supreme Court decision consolidates two administrative matters against former Judge Jose S. Peñas, Jr. The Court retains jurisdiction despite the Judge's retirement, addressing both his conduct as a judge and as a member of the bar.

**A.M. No. RTJ-95-1332 (Illegitimate Children Support):**

*   **Key Provision:** Judge Peñas fathered two illegitimate children, Regina and Cherry Zamudio, while married and prior to his judicial appointment. He initially provided support but later ceased.
*   **Obligation:** The Court orders Judge Peñas to provide support to Cherry Zamudio (currently a student) in the amount of Php 5,000.00 monthly, to be deducted from his retirement benefits.
*   **Liability:** While the complaint against him as a judge is dismissed due to retirement, his obligation to support his illegitimate children remains. His conduct is criticized for failing to meet the moral standards expected of a member of the bar.
*   **Potential Risks:**  Regina Zamudio (married and with a child) may pursue separate legal action to claim support in arrears if her husband cannot provide, invoking Articles 195 and 199 of the Family Code. Both Regina and Cherry can pursue actions in the "appropriate proceedings and the proper forum" for arrears and additional support claims.

**A.M. No. RTJ-98-1398 (Bias and Insubordination):**

*   **Key Issue:** Allegations of bias and partiality in Civil Case No. 270 (mandamus re: road closure) brought by Benjamin R. Arejola.
*   **Finding:** The Court dismisses the charge of bias and partiality due to lack of substantiating evidence (citing *Abad vs. Belen, A.M. No. RTJ-92-813, January 30, 1995*). It emphasizes that bias cannot be presumed and requires convincing proof (*People vs. Serrano, etc., et al., G.R. No. 44712, October 28, 1991*).
*   **Liability:** Judge Peñas is found guilty of serious misconduct and insubordination for failing to comply with multiple Court orders to file a comment.
*   **Penalty:** A fine of Php 5,000.00 is imposed, to be deducted from his retirement benefits. The Court warns of more severe penalties for future similar conduct.
*   **Statutory/Case Law:** The decision references Canon 1 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, requiring judges to uphold the integrity of the judiciary and cited *Guintu vs. Lucero, A.M. No. MTJ-93-794, August 23, 1996* and *Longboan vs. Polig, A.M. No. R-704-RTJ, June 14, 1990* re: disobeying Court orders.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Legal Arguments:**

*   The statement that Regina is no longer entitled to present and future support as the duty devolves primarily on her husband is qualified by the phrase "unless it shall be proven in the proper proceedings that recourse may be had against the other persons provided by law to be successively liable to support her." This leaves open the possibility of future litigation if the husband cannot provide sufficient support.
*   The decision does not define the 'appropriate proceedings' or 'proper forum' for the recovery of support in arrears or enforcement of other rights. It is important to determine if it is a civil action, and if so, the appropriate venue.
*   The penalty of Php 5,000 is only a warning; however, a further failure to comply with the decisions of the court could result in harsher penalties or a disbarment proceeding.
