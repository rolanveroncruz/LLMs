## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 186196

**Case:** *Benedicto V. Yujuico v. Far East Bank and Trust Company (now Bank of the Philippine Islands), substituted by Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.*

**Citation:** 838 Phil. 688; 115 OG No. 19, 4775 (May 13, 2019)

**Core Issue:** Whether the restructuring of a peso-denominated loan to a US dollar-denominated loan constituted a novation, thereby releasing the surety (Yujuico) from liability.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, holding that there was no total or extinctive novation, and Yujuico remained liable as surety.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Omnibus Credit Line (OCL):** Original credit line granted by FEBTC (now BPI) to GTI Sportswear Corporation, secured by a Comprehensive Surety Agreement from Yujuico.
*   **Loan Restructuring Agreement (LRA):** Restructured GTI's outstanding OCL balance. Expressly stated that the restructured loan continues to be secured by the Comprehensive Surety Agreement.
*   **Comprehensive Surety Agreement:** Agreement executed by Yujuico guaranteeing all indebtedness of GTI to FEBTC.
*   **Alleged Agreement to Convert to USD:** GTI claimed FEBTC assured conversion to a USD loan, leading to lower interest payments. FEBTC denied this assurance was unconditional.

**Liabilities:**

*   **GTI Sportswear Corporation:** Liable for the outstanding debt under the Loan Restructuring Agreement (amount specified in statement of account), now in USD.
*   **Benedicto V. Yujuico:** Liable as surety under the Comprehensive Surety Agreement for GTI's debt.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Unequivocal Agreement on Conversion:** The alleged agreement for conversion to USD was not expressly documented, leading to disputes about the terms and conditions. This is crucial for establishing an express novation.
*   **Interpretation of "Comprehensive" Surety Agreement:** The Court emphasized the broad wording of the surety agreement, encompassing future indebtedness. However, arguments could be made regarding the scope of "indebtedness" if fundamental changes were made to the loan structure beyond currency denomination.
*   **Calculation of USD Conversion:** The statement of account reflects a peso-dollar rate of exchange, highlighting a potential area of contention if the rate is disputed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1291 & 1292:** Governs novation, requiring either an express declaration of extinguishment or complete incompatibility between the old and new obligations.
*   **Civil Code Article 1215:** Pertains to solidary obligations and the effect of novation on co-debtors.
*   ***Verches v. Rios, 48 Phil. 16 (1925)***: Discusses the principle of estoppel when a party partially executes a judgment, preventing them from appealing. Distinguished by the Court as there was no execution of judgement here.
*   ***Zapanta v. De Rotaeche, 21 Phil. 154 (1912)***: Explains that for an obligation to be extinguished by novation the extinguishment shall be expressly declared or that the old and new obligations shall be absolutely incompatible.
*    ***Sandico, Sr. v. Piguing, 149 Phil. 422 (1971)***: States that novation requires a declaration in unequivocal terms - clearly and unmistakably shown by the express agreement of the parties or by acts of equivalent import - or that there is complete and substantial incompatibility between the two obligations.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of FEBTC's communications regarding the USD conversion. GTI claimed an assurance; FEBTC denied this assurance was unconditional. This ambiguity fueled the initial lawsuit.
*   The precise scope of the Comprehensive Surety Agreement's coverage of "any and all indebtedness," particularly in light of the restructured loan.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   The case hinges on proving a total or extinctive novation under Article 1292 of the Civil Code. The absence of an express agreement is a major hurdle.
*   Future litigation might focus on challenging the USD conversion rate used by BPI.
*   Further arguments regarding "material alteration" of the underlying loan, which might impact the surety's obligations, could be explored, although the courts may consider this precluded by the comprehensive nature of the agreement.
