## Legal Document Summary: *Angeles v. People*, G.R. No. 172744

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Incident:** Shooting of Cesar Calma (Calma) by Marvin Angeles (Angeles) at a videoke bar after an altercation. Prosecution alleges Angeles initiated the fight. Defense claims Calma's group attacked first, and Zu単iga shot Calma accidentally.
*   **Charge:** Information filed for Frustrated Murder, later convicted of Frustrated Homicide by RTC.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Angeles guilty beyond reasonable doubt based on the positive testimonies of Calma, Zu単iga and Marquez which was corroborated by the medico-legal certificate of Dr. Celestino which states the injuries which Calma had sustained. Attempt to blame Zu単iga deemed not credible. Sentenced Angeles to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of prision correccional as minimum to eight (8) years and one (1) day of prision mayor as maximum and further required to pay Cesar Y. Calma, the sum of P5,935.55 as actual damages and P30,000.00 as moral damages plus the costs.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC, upholding its assessment of witness credibility and factual findings. Found no material inconsistencies in prosecution witnesses' testimonies.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the CA decision.

**Obligations:**

*   Angeles: Served the indeterminate sentence by the RTC and affirmed by the CA and Supreme Court, and is obligated to pay Calma P5,935.55 for medical expenses and P30,000 for moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Angeles: Criminally liable for Frustrated Homicide. Civilly liable for damages to Calma.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The core issue revolved around witness credibility. The lower courts and the Supreme Court gave weight to the prosecution's witnesses due to the lack of ill-motive on their part and consistency in their testimonies. Defense's attempt to blame Zu単iga was deemed an afterthought.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Specifically articles concerning Homicide (consummated, frustrated, attempted), and penalties thereof.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Properly applied to determine Angeles' sentence.
*   **Rules on Evidence (Credibility of Witnesses):** The Supreme Court cited established jurisprudence regarding the high respect given to trial courts' evaluation of witness testimonies.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 388 Phil. 279, 288 (2000):** Absent any reason or motive for a prosecution witness to perjure, the logical conclusion is that no such motive exists and his testimony is thus worthy of full faith and credit.
*   **People v. Salamat, G.R. No. 103295, 20 August 1993, 225 SCRA 499, 507:** Inconsistencies and discrepancies in the testimony referringto minor details, and not on the basic aspects of the crime, do not impair the witness' credibility.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Intent to Kill (animus interficiendi):** While initially charged with Frustrated Murder (requiring proof of evident premeditation and treachery), the conviction was for Frustrated Homicide, indicating the court found intent to kill (an element of homicide) but not the qualifying circumstances for murder. The level of proof for intent could be argued.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The conflicting accounts of the incident hinged entirely on witness credibility. Any weakness in the prosecution's case could have been exploited had the defense been able to demonstrate bias or inconsistencies on material points.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions based on the established principles of witness credibility assessment and the prosecution's successful establishment of guilt beyond reasonable doubt for Frustrated Homicide. The defense's arguments were deemed insufficient to overturn the factual findings.
