## Legal Document Summary: *Mabanto v. Coliflores* (A.M. No. MTJ-04-1533)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Mamerto Y. Coliflores (MTCC, Cebu City) for Serious Misconduct, Inefficiency, Gross Ignorance of the Law, and violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) relating to a supersedeas bond.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Ejectment case (Civil Case No. R-35618) where Mabanto (defendant) appealed to the RTC and posted a P45,000 supersedeas bond to stay execution. RTC remanded the case to MTCC for re-trial.
*   **Alleged Misconduct:** Judge Coliflores granted the plaintiff's ex-parte motion to withdraw the rental deposit under the supersedeas bond *without notice to Mabanto or her counsel*.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Claims notice was given to counsel and the bond withdrawal was for back rentals. P15,000 was allegedly returned.
*   **Complainant's Argument:** No notice was received; supersedeas bond should have remained intact pending final disposition (performance of the judgment appealed from).
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Fine of P2,000.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Coliflores' Obligation:** Ensure proper notice to adverse parties regarding motions affecting their interests, specifically concerning the supersedeas bond. Rule 13, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Liability:** Found GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Notice:** Critical issue is the lack of notice to Mabanto regarding the motion to withdraw the supersedeas bond. This violates fundamental due process. Case law like *Cui v. Madayag* (314 Phil. 846 (1995)) confirms motions without proof of service are not entitled to cognizance.
*   **Ex-Parte Order:** Granting an ex-parte motion affecting a supersedeas bond without notice is highly questionable, especially given the bond's purpose is to secure the performance of the judgment if affirmed.
*   **Rationale for Withdrawal:** The justification for releasing the bond for "back rentals" is problematic because the RTC had remanded the case, meaning the original judgment was not yet final and executory.
*   **Remand Impact:**  The remand by the RTC significantly alters the circumstances, potentially negating the original basis for the supersedeas bond. This raises questions about the propriety of releasing the funds.
*   **Amount Returned:** Discrepancy regarding the P15,000 allegedly returned to the court needs clarification. What was this used for?

**Statutory References:**

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the critical importance of procedural due process, specifically the requirement of notice in legal proceedings. Judge Coliflores' failure to ensure notice to Mabanto before allowing the withdrawal of the supersedeas bond constitutes gross ignorance of the law. The fine imposed reflects the gravity of the offense, even though mitigating circumstances (lack of malicious intent and pre-amendment penalties) were considered. The remand order is a key point of contention, calling into question the original purpose of the bond and the judge's authority to order the withdrawal.
