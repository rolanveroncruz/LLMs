## Legal Document Summary: *Chailese Development Company, Inc. v. Monico Dizon, et al.* (G.R. No. 206788)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision ordering referral of a recovery of possession case to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over parcels of land in Floridablanca, Pampanga owned by Chailese Development Company, Inc. (Petitioner) and occupied by Monico Dizon, et al. (Respondents). Petitioner claims illegal occupation; Respondents assert tenancy rights and argue for DAR jurisdiction.
*   **R.A. No. 6657 (CARL) and R.A. No. 9700 (Amendments):** This is the central statutory framework. R.A. 9700 added Section 50-A, mandating automatic referral to DAR if a party alleges the case is agrarian and involves a farmer, farmworker, or tenant. The court analyzes whether the case should be referred to DAR based on this provision.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** Whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or the DAR has jurisdiction over the case. Petitioner asserts RTC jurisdiction based on recovery of possession; Respondents claim agrarian dispute requiring DAR's primary jurisdiction.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Chailese Development):** Obligation to prove ownership and right to possession. Potential liability for disturbance compensation if Respondents are proven to be tenants.
*   **Respondents (Dizon, et al.):** Obligation to prove tenancy status to invoke DAR jurisdiction. If tenancy is not established, they remain liable as illegal occupants.

**Key Arguments & Holding:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The regular courts has jurisdiction over the case considering that the nature of the controversy is one for recovery of possession.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** The Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter and the nature of the action. Verily, the allegations of the complaint would show that this involves the implementation of Agrarian Reform law hence beyond the pale of jurisdiction of this Court.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition and reversed the CA decision. The SC held that while an allegation that the case is agrarian is sufficient for the first requisite to trigger automatic referral to the DAR under Sec. 50-A of R.A. 9700,  the second requisite - that *one of the parties is a farmer, farmworker, or tenant* - requires *proof*, not mere allegation. Since Respondents failed to adequately prove their tenancy status, the case should *not* be automatically referred to the DAR, and the RTC retains jurisdiction.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   **Sindico v. Hon. Diaz:** On determination of jurisdiction based on allegations in the complaint.
*   **Arzaga v. Copias:** Similar to Sindico on determination of jurisdiction.
*   **Chico v. CA:** Emphasizes that adequate proof of tenancy is required to divest regular courts of jurisdiction and vest it in the DAR. Self-serving statements are insufficient.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "allegation" in Section 50-A R.A. 9700:** The core issue revolves around the interpretation of the word "allegation" within Section 50-A of R.A. No. 9700. The Supreme Court interpreted the "allegation" to only qualify the immediately subsequent statement that the case is agrarian in nature.
*   **Proof of Tenancy:** Adequacy of evidence required to establish tenancy relationship.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Petitioner:** Risk of later challenges to title or further proceedings before DAR if respondents are later able to present sufficient evidence of tenancy.
*   **For Respondents:** Risk of eviction if unable to establish tenancy.

**Next Steps:**

*   The case is remanded to the RTC for further proceedings.
*   Respondents could potentially file a separate action with the DAR to establish tenancy rights, although this ruling would likely be persuasive authority against them.
