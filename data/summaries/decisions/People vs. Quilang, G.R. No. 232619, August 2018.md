**Case Summary: People v. Quilang, G.R. No. 232619 (August 29, 2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs). The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) guilty verdict.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 9165, Sec. 5, Art. II:**  Penalizes the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody Rule:**  Establishes the procedure for handling seized drugs to ensure integrity and evidentiary value. Cites *People v. Tumulak, 791 Phil. 148, 160-161 (2016)*; *People v. Rollo, 757 Phil. 346, 357 (2015)*. Specifically, Section 21 (a), Article II of the IRR of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640 allows for marking and inventory at the place of arrest, the nearest police station or the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in instances of warrantless seizures.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Elements of Illegal Sale Proven:** The RTC and CA correctly found all the elements of illegal sale were present: identity of buyer and seller, object (shabu), consideration (payment), delivery of the shabu, and payment. Cites *People v. Sumili, 753 Phil. 342, 348 (2015)*.
*   **Chain of Custody Sufficiently Complied With:** Despite the marking and inventory not being done immediately at the place of arrest, the SC held that the chain of custody was sufficiently complied with because the marking, inventory, and photography were conducted at the PDEA Region 2 Office in the presence of required witnesses (Barangay Captain, DOJ representative, media representative). Cites *People v. Mamalumpon, 167 Phil. 845, 855 (2015)*.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC deferred to the RTC's assessment of witness credibility, noting the trial court was in the best position to evaluate their testimonies. Cites *Cahulogan v. People, G.R. No. 225695, March 21, 2018*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:**  Has the burden to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, including establishing the elements of the crime and the integrity of the corpus delicti (dangerous drug).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Jomar Quilang:** Found guilty of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Deviation from strict compliance with the chain of custody rule:**  While the SC affirmed the conviction, the case highlights the importance of strictly adhering to the chain of custody rule.  Any significant deviation, even if arguably justifiable under Section 21 (a), can be grounds for challenging the admissibility of evidence and potentially lead to acquittal.
*   **Defense of Denial:** The accused's defense relied on denial and alleged frame-up.  This highlights the importance of thoroughly investigating and documenting the buy-bust operation to rebut such defenses, including strong witness testimony and meticulous documentation of the chain of custody.
