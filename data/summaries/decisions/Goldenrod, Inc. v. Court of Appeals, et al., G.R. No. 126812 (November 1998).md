## Legal Document Summary - *Goldenrod, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.*

**Case:** *Goldenrod, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, Pio Barretto & Sons, Inc., Pio Barretto Realty Development, Inc., and Anthony Que*, G.R. No. 126812, November 24, 1998.

**Subject Matter:** Determination of whether a seller can retain earnest money when a sale fails due to the buyer's default in the absence of a specific forfeiture clause.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Goldenrod (Buyer) and Pio Barretto & Sons/Pio Barretto Realty (Seller) entered into an agreement for the sale of real property. Goldenrod gave P1,000,000 as earnest money, intended as part of the purchase price.
*   **Buyer's Default:** Goldenrod failed to secure financing to pay the outstanding mortgage on the property by the deadline, despite extensions.
*   **Extrajudicial Rescission:** Goldenrod informed the Seller it could not proceed and demanded the return of the earnest money.
*   **Seller's Actions:** The Seller did not object to the rescission and sold the property to a third party (Asiaworld).
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Ordered the return of earnest money, finding no forfeiture agreement and unjust enrichment.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Reversed, dismissing the complaint.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the Court of Appeals, ordering the return of the earnest money with legal interest.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Seller's Obligation:** Upon extrajudicial rescission without objection and subsequent sale to a third party, the Seller (Pio Barretto Realty) has the obligation to return the earnest money to the Buyer (Goldenrod) as per Article 1385 of the Civil Code.
*   **Liability for Interest:** The Seller is liable for legal interest on the earnest money from the date it received notice of rescission (August 30, 1988) until full payment.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Forfeiture Clause:** The absence of a specific clause in the agreement explicitly stating that the earnest money would be forfeited in case of the buyer's default is the central contentious issue. The Court emphasized that the parties did not intend to forfeit the money, especially with no express agreement.
*   **Implied Consent to Rescission:** The Seller's silence and subsequent sale to a third party were interpreted as implied consent to the rescission of the contract, thus triggering the obligation to return the earnest money.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1482, Civil Code:** Earnest money is considered part of the purchase price and proof of the contract's perfection.
*   **Art. 1385, Civil Code:** Rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of the contract together with their fruits and interest.
*   **Art. 22 and 23, Civil Code:** Prohibition of unjust enrichment.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***University of the Philippines v. de los Angeles*, 35 SCRA 102 (1970):** Rescission is subject to judicial scrutiny.
*   ***Adelfa Properties, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 240 SCRA 565 (1995):** Extrajudicial rescission of reciprocal contracts is permissible unless successfully challenged in court.
*   ***Halili v. Doret*, 95 Phil 78 (1954):** Vendor is obligated to return the purchase price if the buyer rescinds.
*   ***Palay Inc. v. Clave*, 124 SCRA 638 (1983):** Vendor must return purchase price when the transaction is called off and the property has already been sold to a third party.

**Legal Analysis:**

The case highlights the importance of clearly defining the treatment of earnest money in a contract to sell. The Supreme Court emphasizes that in the absence of a clear forfeiture clause, the earnest money is considered part of the purchase price and must be returned if the sale falls through, especially when the seller does not object to the rescission and subsequently sells the property to another party. This decision clarifies the application of Art. 1482 and Art. 1385 of the Civil Code in situations involving earnest money and rescission.
