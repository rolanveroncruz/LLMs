Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc. v. Leonisa M. Delgado* (G.R. No. 168210, June 17, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the NLRC's award of death benefits to the respondent, wife of a deceased seafarer, Jerry M. Delgado.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Jerry M. Delgado was hired by Coastal Safeway Marine Services, Inc. (Coastal) as a Chief Engineer.
*   **Death:** Jerry died during the term of his employment in Saudi Arabia due to "acute cessation of blood circulation and respiration."
*   **Claim for Benefits:** Leonisa M. Delgado, Jerry's wife, filed a claim for death benefits, which Coastal denied.
*   **Governing Law:** The central issue is which POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC) applies: the one in effect based on DOLE Department Order No. 4 and POEA Memorandum Circular No. 9, Series of 2000 (which Coastal argues applies), or the earlier version based on POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055, Series of 1996 (which the CA and NLRC held applies). The SC ruled that the applicable SEC is POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055, Series of 1996, due to the Supreme Courtâ€™s Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the implementation of the later SEC at the time Jerry boarded the ship.
*   **Validity of Waiver:** Coastal presented a notarized affidavit of waiver purportedly executed by Jerry, releasing Coastal from liability. The NLRC and the SC disregarded the waiver, deeming it against public policy and potentially spurious, as it was only introduced on appeal.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Court upheld the award of attorney's fees to Leonisa, citing Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code and relevant jurisprudence in labor cases.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Based on POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055, Series of 1996, the employer is liable for death benefits if the seafarer dies during the term of their employment, regardless of whether the death is work-related.
*   Coastal is obligated to pay death benefits of US$50,000 plus US$7,000 for each of the four children under 21.
*   Coastal is also liable for attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** The decision reaffirms the solidary liability of the principal (Arabian Marine) and the local agent (Coastal) under Section 10 of R.A. No. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act).
*   **Waiver Invalidity:** The decision reinforces the principle that waivers and quitclaims in labor cases are often viewed skeptically and may be deemed invalid, especially if they are not demonstrably voluntary and entered into with full understanding of rights. The court noted that the employee brought possible infirmities with him, and in issuing a fit-to-work certification, the employer assumed the risk of liability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):**  Establishes solidary liability between the principal and local agent.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2208(2):** Basis for awarding attorney's fees when the defendant's act or omission compels the plaintiff to litigate.
*   **POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC) [specifically POEA Memorandum Circular No. 055, Series of 1996]:**  Defines the terms and conditions of employment for Filipino seafarers.
*   **NYK-Fil Ship Management, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 161104, September 27, 2006, 503 SCRA 595, 603-604; Pentagon International Shipping, Inc. v. Adelantar, G.R. No. 157373, July 27, 2004, 435 SCRA 342, 348:** Governed by the contracts they sign every time they are hired or rehired; and as long as the stipulations therein are not contrary to law, morals, public order or public policy, they have the force of law between the parties.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central ambiguity revolved around which version of the POEA SEC applied. The Supreme Court clarified this, solidifying the application of the earlier version due to the TRO.
*   The validity of the waiver is also contentious, as waivers are carefully scrutinized in labor cases.
