**Case Summary: Uy v. Chua, G.R. No. 183965, September 18, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the RTC's grant of a Demurrer to Evidence, dismissing the Petition for Issuance of a Decree of Illegitimate Filiation.

**Key Issue:** Whether a prior Compromise Agreement, judicially approved, barring claims of filiation constitutes res judicata in a subsequent action for the same relief.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Joanie Surposa Uy filed a petition for illegitimate filiation against Respondent Jose Ngo Chua.
*   Prior to this, a similar petition was filed by Petitioner (Special Proceeding No. 8830-CEB) which ended in a Compromise Agreement.
*   The Compromise Agreement, judicially approved, stipulated that Petitioner (and her brother) acknowledged no blood relationship with Respondent in exchange for monetary compensation. They also waived all future claims.
*   Respondent filed a Demurrer to Evidence in the current case (Special Proceeding No. 12562-CEB), arguing res judicata.
*   RTC granted the Demurrer.

**Ruling:**

*   **Res Judicata Inapplicable:** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC, holding that the doctrine of res judicata did not apply because the Compromise Agreement was void ab initio.
*   **Compromise Agreement Violates Art. 2035, Civil Code:** The Court cited Article 2035 of the Civil Code, which prohibits compromises on civil status, future support, and future legitime. The Compromise Agreement, in effect, settled the question of petitioner's filiation and waived her rights to future support and legitime, rendering it invalid.
*   **Court's Lack of Jurisdiction:** The initial RTC (Branch 9) lacked the jurisdiction to approve a compromise that was contrary to law and public policy. *Francisco v. Zandueta*, 61 Phil. 752 (1935) cited to emphasize lack of jurisdiction. A void judgement is no judgement at all and cannot be the basis of any right. *Galicia v. Manliquez Vda. de Mindo*, G.R. No. 155785.
*   **Admission in Compromise Agreement:** While the Compromise Agreement is void, the admission by the Petitioner may still be appreciated as evidence. This is supported by precedent in De Asis v. Court of Appeals.
*   **Remand for Further Proceedings:** The case was remanded to the RTC for continuation of hearing, allowing Respondent to present evidence. Demurrer to evidence was considered more appropriately a Motion to Dismiss, not an adjudication on the merits. *Condes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 161304 cited for Demurrer to Evidence.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2035, Civil Code:** Prohibition on compromises regarding civil status, future support, and future legitime.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Basis for appeal on pure questions of law.
*   **Articles 2028, 1318, Civil Code** Compromise is a contract. All contracts should comply with consent, subject matter, and cause of obligation and must not be contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy and public order.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's Continued Litigation:** Respondent will now have to present evidence in the RTC to contest the claim of illegitimate filiation.
*   **Evidentiary Value of Admission:** The petitioner's admission in the Compromise Agreement could be used against her in the re-opened proceedings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's initial approval of the Compromise Agreement, later deemed void, raises questions about the enforceability of judicially sanctioned settlements that conflict with public policy.
