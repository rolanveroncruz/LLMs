**Case:** *Rizza Lao @ Nerissa Laping v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 159404, June 27, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, seeking reversal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(a) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions and Factual Background:**

*   **Charge:** Accused (Lao) and co-accused (Acapulco) induced the complainant (Juinio) to invest sums of money (₱86,000.00 and US$20,000.00) based on false pretenses of having influence to secure him a government position (General Manager of LLDA) and engaging in brokerage/vehicle importation businesses.
*   **False Pretenses:** Representations about influence with Mrs. Ramos (stepmother of then President Ramos), the existence of business ventures with Mrs. Ramos and Acapulco, and the intended use of funds.
*   **Reliance and Damage:** Complainant parted with money based on these representations, suffering financial loss when the promised benefits did not materialize, and ventures turned out to be non-existent.

**Obligations:**

*   The Accused had the obligation to deliver on their promise regarding the complainant's application to the General Manager of the LLDA.
*   The Accused had the obligation to use the funds contributed by the complainant for the benefit of the business venture they both agreed to form.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Lao found guilty of Estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(a), RPC.
*   **Civil Liability:** Lao ordered to indemnify the complainant's heirs (Elmer Juinio had passed) for the amounts defrauded (₱86,000.00 and US$19,970.00).
*   The court rules that In cases of estafa falling under paragraph 2(a) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, inability to benefit from the money obtained from the private complainant does not relieve the accused of criminal responsibility.
*   *United States v. Umali, 15 Phil. 33, 38 (1910).*

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Memorandum Decision" Argument:** Lao argued CA decision was merely a reiteration of the RTC's findings and thus defective. The Court rejected this, citing jurisprudence allowing the Supreme Court to resolve disputes based on the records, especially when the case has been pending for years.
*   **Disputed Facts:** Lao attempted to introduce conflicting evidence regarding the purpose of the funds and her role in the transactions. The Court gave credence to the prosecution's version and the complainant's testimony.
*   **Application of Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The Court modified the penalty imposed by the trial court based on *People of the Philippines v. Gabres, 335 Phil. 242, 257 (1997); People of the Philippines v. Fajardo, 399 Phil. 109, 128-129 (2000); Jose v.
