**Legal Document Summary: *Gutierrez v. Mendoza-Plaza*, G.R. No. 185477, December 4, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 89555, which affirmed the RTC's decision in Civil Case No. 06-04-2929 (accion reivindicatoria, publiciana, and quieting of title).

**Key Issue:** Ownership of unregistered land in Barangay Sta. Clara, Sto. Tomas, Batangas.  Dispute between descendants of Ignacio Mendoza (first marriage: Dominador & Victoria; second marriage: Crisostomo, Flora, Felisa, Mercedes & Constancia).  Petitioners (descendants of Victoria) claim ownership by succession and acquisitive possession. Respondents (descendants of Ignacio's second marriage) claim ownership based on a 1940 Deed of Donation Inter Vivos (Exhibit "B").

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA's Amended Decision.  Respondents are the rightful owners.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Deed of Donation Inter Vivos (Exhibit "B"):** Ignacio Mendoza donated the subject property to his children from his second marriage.  The deed was notarized but *not* registered. This is the crux of the dispute.
*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Succession and adverse possession. Petitioners claim the document is not valid.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** They were assigned ownership of the property by Ignacio's Deed of Donation, and have taken possession since then.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Ordered to cease disturbing respondents' ownership and possession. Ordered to demolish structures built on the property in bad faith and restore possession to the respondents.
*   **Respondents:** No explicit obligations outlined in the decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Liable for moral damages (P50,000 to Ponciano Hernandez) and attorney's fees (P20,000 to both respondents), plus costs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement:** Petitioners may resist demolition and eviction, leading to further legal action.
*   **Damages:** The monetary award might be subject to execution if petitioners fail to pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 194 of Act No. 2711 (as amended by Act Nos. 2837 & 3344) and Section 113 of Presidential Decree No. 1529:** These govern the recording of instruments relating to unregistered lands. The court emphasizes that the non-registration of the deed does not invalidate the contract between the parties and their heirs.
*   **Section 30, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the admissibility of notarized documents. The SC found that the petitioners failed to overcome the presumption of authenticity of the Deed of Donation Inter Vivos.
*   **Article 1119 of the Civil Code:** Acts of possession by tolerance of the owner do not give rise to a claim of ownership by prescription.
*   **Heirs of Eduardo Manlapat v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125585, 8 June 2005, 459 SCRA 412, 426**: Validates the Court of Appeal's use of this reference, for the point that conveyance of unregistered land shall not be valid against any person unless registered, except (1) the grantor, (2) his heirs and devisees, and (3) third persons having actual notice or knowledge thereof.
*   **Pasco v. Pison-Arceo Agricultural and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 165501, 28 March 2006, 485 SCRA 514, 523**: Validates the SC's citation, affirming that points of law, theories, issues, and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time at such late stage.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The most contentious aspect is the non-registration of the Deed of Donation Inter Vivos and its effect on third parties. While the court acknowledged the lack of registration, it ruled that the petitioners, as heirs of the grantor (Ignacio), are bound by the deed. This hinges on the interpretation of "heirs" as extensions of the grantor.
*   The exclusion of petitioners from sharing in the property. However, the court did not rule on this issue because it was raised for the first time on appeal.

**Legal Analysis:**

The court relied heavily on the presumption of validity of the notarized deed and the fact that petitioners are heirs of the grantor, thus binding them to the deed despite its non-registration. The court rejected the petitioners' claims of acquisitive prescription due to the permissive nature of their possession. The failure to raise the issue of legitime impairment in the lower courts also proved fatal to their case.
