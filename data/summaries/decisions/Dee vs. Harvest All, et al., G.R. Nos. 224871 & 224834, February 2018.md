Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court Resolution in *Dee v. Harvest All Investment Limited*, G.R. Nos. 224834 & 224871, February 28, 2018:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court denied with finality multiple motions for reconsideration of its March 15, 2017 Decision, which affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, remanding COMM'L CASE NO. 15-234 to the RTC Pasig for further proceedings. The core issue revolves around whether Harvest All, et al. (minority shareholders) paid insufficient filing fees for their complaint concerning the 2015 Annual Stockholders' Meeting (ASM) and Stock Rights Offering (SRO) of Alliance Select Foods International, Inc. (ASFII).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Filing Fees:** The primary legal question is whether Harvest All, et al., paid the correct filing fees for their complaint in the RTC. The central argument is whether the filing fees should have been based on the P1 Billion value of the SRO.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:** The Court is focusing on whether the RTC validly acquired jurisdiction over the case given the concerns about the filing fees.
*   **Mootness:** Several movants argue the case is moot because the 2015 ASM, the 2016 ASM, and the SRO have already occurred without any injunctive relief. They contend remanding the case is a waste of judicial resources. Harvest All et al., counter that they cannot be allowed to render the case moot by their own actions.
*   **Supervening Events:** The court acknowledges the alleged supervening events (completion of SRO and holding of ASMs). However, the Court holds that the RTC is in the best position to determine whether these events render the case moot.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Harvest All et al.:** Obligation to pay correct filing fees. Potential liability for deficiency in filing fees if found to be insufficient and made in bad faith.
*   **RTC Pasig:** Obligation to determine the sufficiency of filing fees and whether the alleged supervening events render the case moot.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** If the RTC determines that insufficient filing fees were paid in bad faith, the court may lack jurisdiction, potentially invalidating any prior or future orders.
*   **Protracted Litigation:** Even if the Court of Appeals' decision remanding the case is not reconsidered, the factual issue regarding mootness must still be litigated in the RTC, potentially leading to further appeals and delays.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   The resolution makes no explicit case law or statutory references. However, the implicit reliance on procedural rules concerning jurisdiction based on proper payment of filing fees suggests familiarity with relevant Rules of Court.
*   **Corporation Code of the Philippines (implied):** The underlying dispute concerns corporate governance issues, implying the applicability of provisions related to stockholders' rights, annual meetings, and stock issuances.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith":** The issue of whether the alleged underpayment of filing fees was made in "good faith" is critical. This determination is inherently fact-sensitive and could be subject to differing interpretations.
*   **Causation/Mootness:** The determination of whether Harvest All, et al. actions, if any, caused the case to become moot and whether they should be allowed to benefit from those actions is a contentious issue.
