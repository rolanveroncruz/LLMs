**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses De Leon vs. Court of Appeals, et al.*, G.R. No. 104796**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the correct docket fees for an action for annulment or rescission of a contract of sale of real property.

**Key Issue:** Whether docket fees for an action for annulment/rescission of a contract of sale of real property should be based on the property's value or treated as an action "where the value of the subject matter cannot be estimated" under Rule 141, §7(b)(1) of the Rules of Court.

**Ruling:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.  The Supreme Court held that an action for annulment or rescission of a contract is not susceptible of pecuniary estimation and, therefore, the docket fees should not be based on the value of the real property, subject matter of the contract sought to be annulled or rescinded.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 141, §7, Rules of Court:** Specifies the fees for filing actions, differentiating between those with a specific sum claimed/property value and those "where the value of the subject matter cannot be estimated."
*   **Last paragraph of §7(b) of Rule 141:**  States that in a real action, the assessed value of the property, or if there is none, the estimated value thereof shall be alleged by the claimant and shall be the basis in computing the fees. The petitioners argued that this applied.
*   **Relief Sought in Original Complaint:** Annulment/rescission of contract, declaration of absolute sale as simulated, and attorney's fees. The absence of a prayer for recovery of money and/or the value of the transaction influenced the court.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Incorrect Assessment of Docket Fees:** The trial court initially required fees based on the property's value, which the Supreme Court deemed incorrect.
*   **Dismissal for Non-Payment of Correct Fees:**  The petitioners initially moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the full docket fees were not paid. This risk is mitigated by the court's final decision.
*   **Splitting a Cause of Action:** The Court references the need to include a prayer for damages in the main action for rescission to avoid later preclusion. This indirectly highlights the need for comprehensive pleading.
*   **Delayed Adjudication:** Disputes over docket fees can lead to delays in resolving the substantive issues of the case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 141, §7, Rules of Court:**  Central to the dispute.
*   **Article 886 of the Civil Code:** Referenced in the original complaint but not substantively addressed in the decision.
*   **Lapitan v. Scandia, Inc., 24 SCRA 479 (1968):**  Provides the criterion for determining if an action is capable of pecuniary estimation – based on the nature of the principal action or remedy sought, and whether the money claim is purely incidental to, or a consequence of, the principal relief sought.
*   **Bautista v. Lim, 88 SCRA 479 (1979):**  Explicitly held that an action for rescission of contract is one which cannot be estimated.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Real Action":** The petitioners argued that the action for annulment/rescission was essentially a real action because it involved real property. The Court rejected this, focusing on the *nature* of the action as being one for rescission.
*   **"Value of the Subject Matter Cannot Be Estimated":** The Court reiterated established jurisprudence that rescission/annulment actions fall under this category, even if the ultimate effect might involve the transfer of property.

**Legal Analysis for Attorney:**

The Supreme Court strongly adheres to the precedent set in *Lapitan* and *Bautista*. This case confirms that an action for annulment or rescission of a contract, even if it concerns real property, is *not* a real action for the purpose of calculating docket fees. The critical factor is the *primary relief sought*: if it's the annulment/rescission itself (and any monetary claim is secondary), then the flat rate applies. When filing similar actions, ensure that prayers are consistent with seeking primarily the annulment or rescission, with any monetary damages clearly subordinate. Be prepared to argue against any attempt to equate the action with a "real action" based solely on the property's value. Be sure to always follow the prevailing case law and double check the prevailing filing fees with the appropriate clerk of court.
