**Legal Document Summary: G.G. Sportswear Manufacturing Corp. v. NLRC (G.R. No. 175406)**

**Case Overview:** Petition for review on certiorari of a CA decision affirming the NLRC's ruling that G.G. Sportswear Manufacturing Corp. (GGSMC) and its President, Nari K. Gidwani (collectively, Petitioners) illegally dismissed several employees (Respondents) and ordering reinstatement and payment of backwages and other monetary claims.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Labor Arbiter found, and the CA affirmed, that the Respondents were illegally dismissed.
*   **Reinstatement:** The NLRC ordered the reinstatement of the illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Monetary Awards:** The NLRC ordered GGSMC and Gidwani, jointly and severally, to pay backwages, attorney's fees, and 13th-month pay to the Respondents, totaling PHP 3,109,869.14.

**Liabilities:**

*   GGSMC and Gidwani are jointly and severally liable for the monetary awards to the illegally dismissed employees.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Service of Decision:** Petitioners argued they did not receive the Labor Arbiter's decision, claiming service was made at their old Mandaluyong address. However, the Court found that the Labor Arbiter was not notified of the change of address, and the decision was deemed properly served at the registered address. This creates a risk for corporations to maintain a proper registry of their current registered address.
*   **Withdrawal of Counsel:** The withdrawal of the Petitioners' former counsel, Atty. Vitales, without the engagement of new counsel, prejudiced their case. The court emphasized the failure of the petitioners to secure new counsel after the withdrawal of Atty. Vitales contributed to their unfavorable outcome.
*   **Pendency of SEC Petition:** Petitioners claimed that the pending petition for suspension of payments before the SEC should have stayed the execution of the NLRC decision. The CA and Supreme Court correctly pointed out that the filing of a suspension of payments petition does not automatically suspend all actions against the corporation.
*   **Lack of Diligence:** The court noted the Petitioners' lack of diligence in failing to file a position paper, inform the Labor Arbiter of their change of address, and promptly appeal the Labor Arbiter's decision.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 902-A:** Initially governed suspension of payments cases (jurisdiction now with Regional Trial Courts per RA 8799).
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Transferred jurisdiction over cases under PD No. 902-A, Sec. 5 to the appropriate Regional Trial Court.
*   **Article 224 of the Labor Code:** Addresses service of decisions to the parties.
*   **2005 Revised Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission, Rule II, Section 8(f)** Addresses change or withdrawal of counsel.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Motion to Withdraw of Atty. Vitales was not set for hearing. However, the court emphasized that the motion to withdraw was still binding.
*   The main contention was regarding the service of decision, as Petitioner claimed that they did not receive the Labor Arbiter's decision.
*   A contentious issue revolves around whether the mere filing of a petition for suspension of payment automatically suspends all actions for claims against the petitioning corporation

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the CA and NLRC rulings. The Court emphasized the Petitioners' lack of diligence, proper notification, and adherence to legal procedures, ultimately leading to the affirmation of the illegal dismissal claims and the monetary awards against GGSMC and Gidwani. The fact that the petition for declaration of suspension of payments was moot due to the fact that it was dismissed in another case was considered. This case highlights the importance of proper service, timely engagement of counsel, and diligently pursuing legal remedies.
