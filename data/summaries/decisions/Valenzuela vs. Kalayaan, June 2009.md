## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Valenzuela v. Kalayaan Development & Industrial Corporation* (G.R. No. 163244)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's rescission of a Contract to Sell and order for petitioners to vacate.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Spouses Valenzuela (Petitioners) entered a Contract to Sell with Kalayaan (Respondent) to purchase 236 sqm of land for P1,416,000.00. Petitioners paid P500,000.00 upon signing and agreed to pay the balance in 12 monthly installments.
*   **Default:** Petitioners defaulted after paying an additional P208,000.00, requesting a deed of sale for half the property (118 sqm). Respondent demanded payment of the outstanding balance.
*   **Alleged Novation:** Petitioners' sister, Juliet, began making monthly payments of P10,000.00, which Respondent accepted. Petitioners claim this constituted novation.
*   **Respondent's Action:** Respondent filed a Complaint for Rescission of Contract and Damages.
*   **RTC Decision:** Rescinded the contract, ordered petitioners to vacate, and awarded attorney's fees.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligation to pay the full purchase price as per the Contract to Sell.
*   **Respondent:** Obligation to execute a deed of absolute sale upon *full* payment of the purchase price.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Found liable for failure to fulfill their obligation to pay the full purchase price. Original contract provides for a 3% monthly compounded penalty which was found iniquitous and reduced to 1% per month.
*   **Respondent:** Ordered to refund the amount paid by the petitioners after deducting the reduced penalty interest. Liable for unjust enrichment if no refund is made.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Rescission vs. Cancellation:** The Court clarifies that the action is more accurately described as *cancellation* due to the nature of a Contract to Sell where full payment is a positive suspensive condition. Failure to pay doesn't breach the contract, but prevents the obligation to convey title from arising. *Rayos v. Court of Appeals* is cited.
*   **Novation Argument:** The Court rejected the novation argument, finding no express agreement to extinguish the old contract. Acceptance of Juliet's payments was deemed mere tolerance, not a modification of the original contract.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** The stipulated 3% monthly penalty interest was deemed unconscionable and reduced to 1% per month (12% per annum) by the Supreme Court, invoking Article 2227 and 1229 of the Civil Code.
*   **Demand:** Petitioners argued lack of valid demand, but the Court impliedly found the demand sufficient, given the communications about the unpaid balance.
*   **Substantial Performance (Art. 1234 Civil Code):** Court did not find substantial performance to apply due to the failure to meet the primary condition of full payment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1191 (Rescission of reciprocal obligations):** Held inapplicable as the obligation to sell didn't arise due to non-payment.
*   **Article 1234 (Substantial Performance):** Not applicable because the primary obligation (full payment) was not substantially performed.
*   **Article 1292 (Novation):** Used to analyze the validity of the alleged novation.
*   **Article 2227 & 1229 (Liquidated Damages):** Used to justify the reduction of the penalty interest.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Rayos v. Court of Appeals*:** Cited to distinguish a contract to sell from a contract of sale and the proper remedy.
*   ***Leano v. Court of Appeals*:** Reinforces the principle that failure to pay in a contract to sell prevents the seller's obligation to convey title from arising.
*    Numerous others mentioned.

**Ambiguities:**

*   While the Court states the action is one for "cancellation", rather than "rescission", the practical outcome is the same: the Contract to Sell is terminated and the petitioners are required to vacate.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the cancellation of the Contract to Sell due to the petitioners' failure to fully pay the purchase price. While the Court reduced the stipulated penalty interest and ordered a refund of payments (less interest), the petitioners ultimately lost their right to acquire the property. The Court emphasized the distinction between a Contract of Sale and a Contract to Sell.
