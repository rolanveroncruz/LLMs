**Legal Document Summary: *Nympha S. Odiamar vs. Linda Odiamar Valencia*, G.R. No. 213582**

**Case Summary:** This is a Resolution on a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Respondent Linda Odiamar Valencia, appealing a previous Decision that ordered Petitioner Nympha Odiamar to pay Respondent P1,010,049.00 (remaining balance of a P1,400,000.00 debt). The Resolution addresses the imposition of legal interest and Respondent's claim that the original debt was P2,100,000.00, not P1,400,000.00.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Principal Obligation:** Petitioner owes Respondent P1,010,049.00 representing the unpaid balance of the loan.
*   **Monetary Interest:** No monetary interest is applicable as there was no express written agreement stipulating such. (Referencing Article 1956 of the Civil Code: No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.)
*   **Compensatory Interest:**
    *   12% per annum from the date of judicial demand (August 20, 2003) until June 30, 2013.
    *   6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until the finality of the ruling.
*   **Post-Judgment Interest:** All monetary awards (including the principal debt, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs of suit) will earn legal interest at 6% per annum from the finality of the ruling until fully paid.
* **Interest on Interest:** The interest due will itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for the principal debt, compensatory interest calculated as detailed above, and the awards for attorney's fees, litigation expenses and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Determination of 'Finality':** The exact date of "finality" of the ruling is crucial for accurate interest calculation. This needs to be clearly documented.
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Successfully collecting the debt and interest may require further legal action (e.g., writ of execution, garnishment).
*   **Respondent's Claim of Higher Debt:** The court rejects the respondent's claim that the initial debt was 2,100,000.00
*   **Ambiguous claim by respondent:** The court determines her claims as reiterations of grounds already evaluated and passed upon in the Assailed Decision, therefore no modification or reversal of the same.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1956 of the Civil Code:** Regarding the requirement of written stipulation for monetary interest.
*   **Title XVIII of the Civil Code:** On Damages
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Provides the guidelines for applying legal interest rates (6% and 12%) based on BSP-MB Circular No. 799.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78:** Modified by Nacar v. Gallery Frames, regarding the application of legal interest.
*   **Article 1169 of the Civil Code:** Regarding delay.
*   **Pen v. Santos, 776 Phil. 50, 62 (2016).** The right to recover interest arises only either by virtue of a contract (monetary interest) or as damages for the delay or failure to pay the principal loan on which the interest is demanded (compensatory interest).

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious area was the disagreement over the total debt and entitlement to interest which the court addressed and resolved against the respondent's favour by determining her claims as reiterations of grounds already evaluated and passed upon in the Assailed Decision.

**Next Steps:**

*   Determine the exact date the Resolution becomes final and executory.
*   Calculate the precise amount due, including principal, interest, attorney's fees, and other costs, considering the varying interest rates over time.
*   Consider initiating enforcement proceedings if the Petitioner does not voluntarily comply with the judgment.
