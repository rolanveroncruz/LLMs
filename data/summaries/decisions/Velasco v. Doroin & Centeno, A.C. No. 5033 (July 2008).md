**Legal Document Summary: *Velasco v. Doroin and Centeno*, A.C. No. 5033**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision in a disbarment case.

**Parties:**
*   Complainant: Mary Jane D. Velasco
*   Respondents: Atty. Charlie Doroin and Atty. Hector Centeno

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Forgery and Falsification:** Velasco alleges that Attys. Doroin and Centeno committed forgery and falsification related to the estate of her deceased father, Eduardo Doroin. Specifically, Atty. Doroin allegedly deceived Velasco into signing an unfavorable Extra-Judicial Settlement and Deed of Partition and forged her late father's signature on a Deed of Absolute Sale.
*   **Notarial Impropriety:** Atty. Centeno, a notary public, allegedly notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale, falsely stating that Eduardo Doroin appeared before him *after* Doroin's death. A criminal case for falsification of a public document was filed against Centeno, but he absconded after arraignment.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility Violations:** The IBP found that respondents violated Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility ("A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct").
*   **Failure to Respond/Cooperate:** Both attorneys repeatedly failed to file comments, attend hearings, or comply with court orders.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Uphold the Law:** The respondents failed to uphold the law.
*   **Obligation to Respond:** Lawyers have an obligation to respond to complaints filed against them and to cooperate with investigations. *Ngayan v. Tugade* is cited in support of this.
*   **Professional Liability:** Lawyers can be disciplined (including suspension or disbarment) for conduct that violates the Code of Professional Responsibility. *Marcelo v. Javier* is referenced regarding the integrity required of legal professionals.
*   **Criminal Liability:** The decision notes that Atty. Centeno faced criminal charges for falsification of a public document.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof Required for Disbarment:** The document highlights the requirement for "clear, convincing and satisfactory proof" in disbarment proceedings. However, due to the respondents' failure to participate, the complainant's allegations were essentially uncontroverted.
*   **Disbarment vs. Suspension:** While the IBP recommended indefinite suspension for both lawyers, the Supreme Court disagreed as to Atty. Centeno, opting for disbarment due to the added element of the criminal conduct for which he had absconded after posting bail.
*   **Ibp Responsibility:** The Supreme Court reminded IBP and regional/city chapters to maintain updated records of members.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Rule 1.01, Canon 1.
*   **Rules of Court:** Section 3, Rule 138 (re: lawyer's oath).
*   **Civil Code:** Art. 887 (re: compulsory heirs); Art. 19 (re: giving every man his due).
*   **Jurisprudence:**
    *   *Ngayan v. Tugade*, A.C. No. 2490 (failure to answer complaint is flouting resistance to lawful orders).
    *   *Marcelo v. Javier*, A.C. No. 3248 (high standards required of attorneys).
    *   *Santos v. Dichoso*, A.C. No. 1825 (burden of proof in disbarment).

**Outcome:**

*   Atty. Charlie Doroin: Indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.
*   Atty. Hector Centeno: Disbarred.

**Legal Significance:** This case highlights the importance of professional responsibility and the consequences of failing to uphold the law, cooperate with disciplinary proceedings, and maintain the integrity expected of legal professionals.
