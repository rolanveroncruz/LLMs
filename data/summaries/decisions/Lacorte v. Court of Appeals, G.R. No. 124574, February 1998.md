**Legal Document Summary - *Lacorte v. Lacorte*, G.R. No. 124574, February 2, 1998**

**Nature:** Appeal by certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision dismissing a complaint for rescission and/or annulment of a Deed of Reconveyance.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Simon Lacorte, Rosario Lacorte, Severino Lacorte, Jerosalina Lacorte-Fernandez, and Cirila Lacorte-Angeles (heirs of Maria Lacorte).
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Peregrino and Adela Lacorte, and Jose Icaca.  Peregrino is a sibling to the petitioners.

**Key Facts:**

*   Maria Lacorte owned land foreclosed by a bank, then sold to Icaca.
*   Icaca (per Agreement with Simon Lacorte acting for the heirs) authorized to purchase the property, granting heirs a right to repurchase (P33,090) within one year (extended to March 1987).
*   Adela Lacorte paid Icaca P26,000 as a deposit.
*   Without the knowledge of all heirs, Peregrino and Adela Lacorte purchased the land in their names via a Deed of Reconveyance from Icaca (February 3, 1987).
*   Petitioners sued to annul the reconveyance, alleging bad faith and violation of prior agreements. Icaca agreed to rescission because he believed the spouses were buying for the benefit of all heirs.
*   Trial court ordered rescission and sale to all heirs and respondent spouses but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding petitioners lacked a cause of action.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agreements (October 17, 1983 & October 16, 1984):** Granted the heirs of Maria Lacorte the right to repurchase the property from Icaca within a specified timeframe. The Court deemed these as creating an equitable mortgage. Cites Art. 1602 of Civil Code regarding equitable mortgages and retention of possession by original owner.
*   **Deed of Reconveyance (February 3, 1987):** Purported transfer of land *solely* to Peregrino and Adela Lacorte.  Central point of contention.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Spouses Lacorte:** Potentially liable for bad faith purchase, unjust enrichment, and breaching the understanding with Icaca and the rights of the other heirs.
*   **Icaca:** Initial potential liability for breach of agreement to allow all heirs to repurchase, which was resolved by his consent to rescission.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether the initial agreements constituted a binding promise to sell to all heirs, or merely an option granted to *any* of them, or even if they were merely for benefit of Simon and not for the benefit of all the petitioners and heirs.
*   The intent behind the Deed of Reconveyance â€“ was it intended to benefit only the spouses, or all the heirs?
*   What "Agreements" were there between Icaca and the Lacorte family, and if they were binding.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Civil Code:**
    *   **Article 1359:** Reformation of instruments due to mistake, fraud, etc.
    *   **Article 1362:** Reformation of instruments for fradulent purposes
    *   **Article 1371:** Interpreting intention of contracting parties.
    *   **Article 1479:** Promises to buy and sell.
    *   **Article 1602:** Equitable Mortgage
*   **Court determined there was a prior equitable mortgage between Icaca and Maria Lacorte's Heirs based on the agreement of October 17, 1983, extension on October 16, 1984 and continued posession by the heirs to the land as lessees.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals, reinstating the trial court's decision (with modifications). It held that the Agreements created an equitable mortgage, and Adela Lacorte's payment inured to the benefit of *all* the heirs. Petitioners were prejudiced by the Deed of Reconveyance and are entitled to its reformation to include their names as parties. Petitioners must contribute pro rata to the payments and expenses.

**Key Legal Arguments & Reasoning:**

*   **Equitable Mortgage:** The Court found the Agreements constituted an equitable mortgage, giving the heirs a right to redeem. Cites various points.
*   **Reconveyance Implies Prior Agreement:** The use of "reconveyance" inherently means bringing it back to the original owner (Maria Lacorte, then her heirs).
*   **Adela's Actions Show Knowledge & Implicit Agreement:** Adela Lacorte's actions (requesting assistance from other heirs, allowing them to remain in possession) demonstrated awareness of the pre-existing agreements and an implied understanding that the property was being repurchased for all the heirs.
*   **Icaca's Intent:** Icaca's testimony clearly indicated his intention to sell the property to all the heirs who could afford to repurchase.
*   **Reformation as Remedy:** The Court found that the Deed of Reconveyance should be reformed to include all the heirs as parties, as there was a meeting of the minds, but fraud by Adela Lacorte resulted in misrepresentation. Art. 1359 applicable.
*   **All the Heirs are in Possession of the Land** all the heirs are therefore prejudiced if excluded from ownership.

**Potential Issues & Further Considerations:**

*   **Accounting:** The trial court will need to conduct an accounting to determine the pro rata contributions required from the petitioners.
*   **Enforcement:** Potential disputes could arise during the enforcement of the decision if any of the parties fail to cooperate.
*   **Good Faith Purchase:** The Court rejected the claim that the spouses were good faith purchasers for value.
