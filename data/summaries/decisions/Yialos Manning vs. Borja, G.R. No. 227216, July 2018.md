**Case Summary: *Yialos Manning Services, Inc. v. Borja* (G.R. No. 227216)**

**Key Issue:** Entitlement to permanent total disability benefits for a seafarer.

**Facts:** Respondent seafarer Borja, employed by Petitioners, claimed permanent total disability due to a back injury sustained on board the vessel. The company-designated physician initially diagnosed lumbar strain and later gave a Grade 11 disability rating (slight rigidity). Borja consulted his own doctor, who declared him permanently unfit. The Labor Arbiter (LA) and National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) awarded total permanent disability, affirmed by the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, granting the petition and reducing the disability award.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC Sec. 20(B)(3):** Requires seafarer to submit to a company-designated physician upon repatriation.  If the seafarer's doctor disagrees, a third, jointly agreed upon doctor's decision is final and binding. This conflict resolution mechanism is central.
*   **POEA-SEC Sec. 32:** Disability shall be based on the schedule provided therein and not on the duration of the seafarer's treatment.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** To provide medical examination and assessment within 120 days, extendable to 240 if needed. To pay disability benefits based on the assessment.
*   **Seafarer's Obligation:** To report to the company-designated physician within three days of arrival. To signify intent to refer to a third doctor to challenge the company doctor's assessment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** Yialos Manning Services and Overseas Shipmanagement are held solidarily liable for the disability benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflict Resolution Procedure (Third Doctor):** The Court emphasizes strict adherence to the POEA-SEC's third-doctor provision. Failure of the seafarer to initiate this process after disputing the company doctor's assessment is fatal to the claim for total and permanent disability. Here, Borja's refusal to submit to a third doctor, after initially agreeing to it, was critical.
*   **120/240 Day Rule:** The SC clarifies that lapse of the 120/240-day period *does not automatically* equate to total and permanent disability. The company-designated physician *must* issue an assessment. If no assessment is made after 240 days, then a conclusive presumption of total and permanent disability arises.
*   **Disability Grading:** The assessment of the *degree* of disability by the company-designated physician is paramount, provided it's timely and not successfully challenged through the third-doctor process. The court will not automatically grant permanent total disability benefits simply based on the seafarer not working for over 120 days.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract):** Considered the law between the parties.
*   ***Kestrel Shipping Co. v. Munar***: Distinguished. The CA misapplied this, as the SC stressed the absence of a third-doctor opinion invalidated the challenge to the company doctor's assessment.
*   ***Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias***: Reiterated the mandatory nature of third-doctor referral.
*   ***Bahia Shipping Services, Inc. v. Constantino***: The seafarer bears the burden of initiating the third-doctor process.
*   ***Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc.***: Clarifies the 120/240-day rule and the company-designated physician's role in determining disability.  Emphasized the importance of the process and consequences of not availing of the procedure
*   ***INC Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Rosales***: Reinforces the importance of medical expertise in disability assessment and warns against manipulating treatment to secure higher benefits.

**Ambiguities & Points of Contention:** The initial agreement to seek a third opinion followed by Borja's refusal became a central point. The Court saw this as a waiver of the right to challenge the company doctor's assessment, ultimately upholding the Grade 11 disability rating and reduced compensation.

**Conclusion:** This case reinforces the importance of strictly adhering to the conflict resolution procedures outlined in the POEA-SEC, particularly the third-doctor provision. The employer's obligation to provide a timely medical assessment is balanced by the seafarer's responsibility to actively challenge that assessment through the agreed-upon mechanism. The Court made it clear that it is the findings from the agreed upon mechanisms and the professional evaluation of medical staff not the duration of medical needs alone that are the ultimate determinant of degree of disability.
