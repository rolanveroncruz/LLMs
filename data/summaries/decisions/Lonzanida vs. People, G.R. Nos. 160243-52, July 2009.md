## Legal Document Summary: *Lonzanida v. People* (G.R. Nos. 160243-52)

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari challenging the Sandiganbayan's decision convicting Romeo Lonzanida, former Municipal Mayor of San Antonio, Zambales, of ten (10) counts of Falsification of Public Document under Article 171, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The charges stemmed from the notarization of false Affidavits of Ownership and Joint Affidavits related to applications for Tax Declarations over public land.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Violation:** Article 171(2) and (4) RPC - Falsification of Public Document. Specifically, the accused (Lonzanida) caused it to appear that persons participated in acts/proceedings when they did not, and made untruthful statements.
*   **Falsified Documents:** 13 Affidavits of Ownership for Lot No. 5504, and 13 identically worded Joint Affidavits, all notarized by Lonzanida.
*   **False Representation:** The Affidavits of Ownership contained false information, including minors falsely represented as owners and occupants of the land for 30+ years and some affiants denied signing these documents. The Joint Affidavits were supposedly executed by a deceased person and an illiterate person who could not have signed them.
*   **Official Position:** Lonzanida, as mayor, abused his authority to administer oaths under Sections 41 and 42 of the Administrative Code of 1987, as amended by R.A. No. 6733. He notarized documents not related to "matters of official business".
*   **Motivation:** The falsified documents enabled the acquisition of Tax Declarations over the land, which the applicant (Madarang) sought to sell.
*   **Recantation:** Witnesses (Elsie de Dios, Leopoldo Cacho, and Rene Abad) recanted their initial testimonies. The Sandiganbayan rejected these recantations.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Public Officer's Duty:** As a mayor, Lonzanida had a duty to properly administer oaths and ensure the accuracy of information in notarized documents.
*   **Liability for Falsification:** Lonzanida was found guilty of falsifying public documents because he used his official position to attest to false information, violating the public faith and destroying the truth (Lumancas v. Intas).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Sandiganbayan relied heavily on circumstantial evidence ( People v. Modesto). Lonzanida argued that the evidence was insufficient for conviction, but the court determined there was enough.
*   **Lack of Direct Proof:**  Lonzanida argued the lack of direct proof of his participation in the forgery. The court held that it wasn't necessary given his role in notarizing the false documents.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 171, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes falsification of public documents.
*   **Sections 41 & 42, Administrative Code of 1987 (as amended by R.A. No. 6733):** Outlines the authority and duties of officers authorized to administer oaths.
*   ***Lumancas v. Intas*:**  Establishes that the intent to gain or injure a third party is not necessary for conviction of falsifying public documents.
*   ***People v. Modesto*:** Discusses standards for appreciating circumstantial evidence.
*   ***People v. Genobia***: Addressed conviction based on the quality and the inferences derived from the evidence.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the Sandiganbayan's conviction, finding that all elements of falsification of public documents were met. Lonzanida abused his official position to notarize false documents, and circumstantial evidence sufficiently proved his guilt. The case emphasizes the responsibility of public officers in administering oaths and the consequences of violating the public trust.
