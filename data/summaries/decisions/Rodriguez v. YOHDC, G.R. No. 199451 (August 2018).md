**Case:** *Iris Rodriguez v. Your Own Home Development Corporation (YOHDC)*, G.R. No. 199451, August 15, 2018.

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute arising from alleged misappropriation of funds in a low-cost housing project.  YOHDC hired Tarcisius Rodriguez (petitioner Iris Rodriguez's husband) as project manager. Tarcisius allegedly misrepresented the purchase price of land and requested checks from YOHDC, purportedly for the land owner (Rosillas) and surveyor (Delos Reyes).  Instead of delivering the checks, Tarcisius and Iris deposited them into their personal accounts. YOHDC discovered the irregularities and sought reimbursement from the banks, eventually recovering the funds.  The Rodriguez Spouses then sued YOHDC, claiming that Delos Reyes had received a portion of the payment (P424,000), leading to the claim that YOHDC was unjustly enriched by receiving this amount. The RTC initially ruled for Rodriguez, ordering YOHDC to pay back P424,000. The CA reversed, and the Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Employment (implied):** Tarcisius was obligated to manage the project honestly and remit funds properly.  Breach of this duty created liability for the Rodriguez Spouses.
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law/Commercial Law:** The case hinges on forged endorsements, liabilities of drawee and collecting banks, and warranties of endorsers. See *Associated Bank v. CA*, 322 Phil. 677 (1996).
*   **Article 22, Civil Code (Unjust Enrichment):** Petitioner argued YOHDC was unjustly enriched by retaining the P424,000, which she claims Delos Reyes already received as payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Tarcisius Rodriguez:** Liable for breach of fiduciary duty as project manager and potentially for fraud/estafa. Now deceased.
*   **Iris Rodriguez:** Liable for depositing checks with forged endorsements into her account and potential liability for fraud/estafa as well.
*   **Metrobank (Drawee Bank):** Initially liable for paying on forged endorsements but ultimately reimbursed by BPI.
*   **BPI (Collecting Bank):** Liable for accepting checks with forged endorsements. They reimbursed Metrobank.
*   **YOHDC:** No liability to Rodriguez. The recovery of the misappropriated funds by YOHDC was lawful.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The core dispute revolves around whether Delos Reyes actually received P424,000 and whether YOHDC was properly credited by the payments made for land survey. The SC stressed that this was a factual issue, inappropriate for a Rule 45 petition.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The main issue is whether Delos Reyes ever received that money.
*   **Conflicting Documents:** Delos Reyes' Affidavit stating he didn't receive the checks versus his Answer acknowledging receipt of P424,000 (and citing the problematic Acknowledgement).
*   **Reliability of Retractions:** The Answer, potentially construed as a retraction of the Affidavit, is viewed with suspicion under established jurisprudence *People v. Deauna* G.R. Nos. 143200-01, August 1, 2002.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 22, Civil Code:** Basis for the unjust enrichment claim.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 20:**  Proof of private documents; importance of authentication to have documents be admissible in court.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Procedure of the court regarding the filing of a petition.

**Case Law References:**

*   ***Associated Bank v. Court of Appeals,*** 322 Phil. 677 (1996) regarding the liabilities of the banks in this case and endorsements.
*   ***People v. Deauna,*** G.R. Nos. 143200-01, August 1, 2002 concerning the reliability of witnesses in court and credibility of retractions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Delos Reyes' Answer:** The limited admission in his Answer (only the existence of the Acknowledgement, not its veracity or the source of funds) is a point of contention. The SC ruled this wasn't a categorical admission of the facts within the private document.

**Recommendations (for further legal action, if applicable):**

*   Given the SC's finding that the main issue is factual, no legal claim is appropriate.
*   If there is evidence that the Rodriguez Spouses paid for the services, that claim should be against Delos Reyes as the authorized payment had come from the company they worked for.
