## Legal Document Summary: *Team Energy Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*

**Case:** G.R. Nos. 197663 & 197770, March 14, 2018

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on *Certiorari* regarding a claim for refund of unutilized input Value Added Tax (VAT) attributable to zero-rated sales.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 112(D) of the 1997 NIRC (now 112(C)):** Establishes the 120+30 day period for VAT refund claims. CIR has 120 days to act on the claim; if denied (expressly or by inaction), the taxpayer has 30 days to appeal to the CTA.
*   **Sections 110(A) and 113 of the 1997 NIRC:**  Substantiation requirements for input VAT claims, requiring VAT invoices or official receipts with specific information (VAT registration, TIN, etc.).
*   **Section 108(B)(3) of the 1997 NIRC:** Services rendered to entities exempt under special laws or international agreements can be zero-rated. (This is tied to NPC's tax exemption under its charter).
*   **Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 (Consolidated Value Added Tax Regulations):**  Details invoicing requirements.
*   **Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-03:** Reinforces the distinct requirement of VAT invoices for goods and VAT official receipts for services.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** Failure to comply with the 120+30-day period is fatal to the claim (jurisdictional). *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc.*, 646 Phil. 710 (2010) and *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation*, 703 Phil. 310 (2013).
*   **Substantiation:** Failure to properly substantiate input VAT with correct VAT invoices or official receipts will lead to disallowance. *AT&T Communications Services Phils., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 747 Phil. 337 (2014) highlights the distinct requirement of invoices for goods and official receipts for services.
*   **Reliance on Outdated Rulings:**  Taxpayer's reliance on Revenue Regulations No. 7-95 is weak, given Section 291 of the Tax Code, which dictates that any rules contrary to the NIRC will be automatically modified. The CIR is only estopped from asserting the non-zero rating based on their *prior approval* of it, but *not from ensuring* that the taxpayer complied with the *substantive* requirements.
*   **Changing legal interpretation:** This case demonstrates the constant and evolving nature of the law. What might be considered a justifiable reliance on a ruling at one point in time might no longer be the case after a new ruling.
*   **Belated raising of issues:** While the State is generally not bound by the errors of its agents, issues raised for the first time on appeal may not be considered, especially if they contradict prior stipulations of fact.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interchangeability of Invoices and Official Receipts (pre-RA 9337):** While *AT&T Communications Services Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 640 Phil. 613 (2010) initially allowed sales invoices for services if requirements were met, *AT&T Communications Services Phils., Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 747 Phil. 337 (2014) clarified a distinction.  The Court ultimately upheld the stricter interpretation requiring *official receipts* for services.

**Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (NIRC):** Sections 106, 108, 110, 112(D) (now 112(C)), 113, 237, 291
*   **Republic Act No. 1125:** As amended by Rep. Act No. 9282
*   **Republic Act No. 9136 (EPIRA Law)**
*   **Republic Act No. 6395 (NPC Charter)**
*   **Republic Act No. 9337**

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *denied* both petitions, *affirming* the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc decision. Team Energy was only entitled to the reduced refund of P11,161,392.67 for the *first quarter* of 2003 due to prescription issues for subsequent quarters and disallowance of input VAT for failing to meet substantiation requirements. The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of the 120+30-day rule and the strict compliance required for VAT refund claims.
