**Legal Document Summary: *Argallon-Jocson v. Court of Appeals*, 611 Phil. 730 (2009)**

**Case Overview:**

This is a petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a trial court order that nullified an execution sale. The underlying case concerns a complaint for reconveyance and damages filed by Jocson against Marcelo Steel Corporation and MCFC.

**Key Provisions and Rulings:**

*   **Nature of Obligation:** The central legal issue is whether the judgment debt against Marcelo Steel and MCFC is joint or solidary. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling that, due to the lack of explicit indication of solidary liability in the original trial court decision, the obligation is *joint*. Cites *PH Credit Corporation v. Court of Appeals* as precedent, that it would be inequitable to allow judgment obligors to shoulder entire monetary judgments when their legal liabilities are limited only to their proportionate shares in the entire obligation.

*   **Execution Sale Nullified:** The trial court nullified the execution sale of Marcelo Steel's properties because it was held that Marcelo Steel was being compelled to pay the entire debt, not just its joint share.

*   **Procedural Defect - Lack of Proper Verification and Certification:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition for review based on critical procedural defects:
    *   **Unsigned Pleading:** Jocson's counsel did not sign the petition for review, rendering it legally ineffective as per Rule 7, Section 3 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
    *   **Defective Verification/Non-Forum Shopping:** Jocson did not sign the Verification and Certification for Non-Forum Shopping. The certification must be made by *all* petitioners, not just one. *Athena Computers, Inc. v. Reyes* is cited for the requirement of verification and non-forum shopping to be signed by all co-petitioners. Subsequent submission of a Special Power of Attorney was deemed insufficient, as it was filed late without proper explanation.
    *   **Incompatible Remedy:** Jocson filed a Motion for Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution to execute the judgment against MCFC, which is inherently inconsistent with challenging the CA's ruling that the obligation was joint.
    *   **Writ of execution vs. Maria Christina Fertilizer corporation** The Supreme Court acknowledged the need to execute the decision as against the other defendant Maria Christina Fertilizer Corporation

**Obligations:**

*   **Marcelo Steel and MCFC:** Jointly liable for the original judgment debt. Marcelo Steel has already paid the debt proportional to its share in the joint liability. Jocson has been granted an Alias writ of execution to implement the remainder of the judgment against MCFC.
*   **Jocson**: Obligated to pursue the judgment only against each party for their respective joint shares.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriffs:** The Court of Appeals found that the Sheriffs disregarded the trial court's 24 February 1999 Decision, and deviated from the trial court's Order dated 9 December 2002 and the writ of execution dated 20 December 2002, which directed them to execute the writ in accordance with the tenor of the decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Joint vs. Solidary Interpretation:** The interpretation of the dispositive portion of the original trial court decision regarding the nature of liability. The lack of explicit language specifying solidary liability has been detrimental to Jocson's case.
*   **Remedies vs. MCFC:** Jocson's success in executing the remaining judgment against MCFC may depend on MCFC's available assets and the enforcement efforts.
*   **Third-Party Claims (Midas Corp.):** Although initially a factor, Midas Corp.'s claim regarding a mortgage on levied properties is no longer central to the ruling, but the indemnity bond posted by Jocson could potentially be an issue if Midas Corp. were to pursue a claim.

*   *Athena Computers, Inc. v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 156905, 5 September 2007, 532 SCRA 343.
*   *Docena v. Lapesura*
*   *Altres v. Empleo, G.R. No. 180986, 10 December 2008; Tible & Tible Company, Inc. v. Royal Savings and Loan Association, G.R. No. 155806, 8 April 2008, 550 SCRA 562; Clavecilla v. Quitain, G.R. No. 147989, 20 February 2006, 482 SCRA 623.*
*   *People v. De Grano , G.R. No. 167710, 5 June 2009.*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision due to fatal procedural errors in the petition. The substantive issue of joint vs. solidary liability was decided against Jocson. Her current recourse is limited to pursuing the remaining judgment amount against MCFC only.
