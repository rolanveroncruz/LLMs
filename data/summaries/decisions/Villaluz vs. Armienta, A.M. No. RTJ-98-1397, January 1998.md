**Legal Document Summary: *Villaluz v. Armienta***

**Case:** A.M. No. RTJ-98-1397

**Parties:**

*   **Complainants:** Spouses Deogracias and Belma Villaluz Jr. (Clients of Atty. Villaluz)
*   **Respondents:** Judge Wenifredo Armenta (RTC Judge) and Atty. Pio L. Villaluz (Lawyer for the Villaluz spouses)

**Subject Matter:** Administrative complaint against a Judge for "Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Judgment" and disciplinary action against the lawyer who filed the complaint.

**Facts:**

*   Judge Armenta ruled against the Villaluz spouses in Civil Case No. 5628, granting an easement of right of way over their property per Articles 650 and 652 of the Civil Code.  The decision ordered the removal of a fence and part of their house, and payment of moral damages.
*   No appeal was filed from the decision, which became final and executory.
*   Atty. Villaluz, on behalf of the Villaluz spouses, filed an administrative complaint against Judge Armenta alleging that the judgment was unjust, and a criminal complaint for violation of Article 204 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   The Court dismissed the administrative complaint and ordered Atty. Villaluz to show cause why he should not be disciplined for filing a baseless complaint.  The Prosecutor also dismissed the criminal complaint, finding no evidentiary basis.
*   Atty. Villaluz delayed compliance with the Court's order and provided conflicting explanations for his actions (or inaction).
*   The Villaluz spouses claimed Atty. Villaluz failed to inform them of the decision, that filing the complaints were Atty. Villaluz's idea, and that they had to hire another counsel.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 650 and 652:**  Relating to the establishment of easements of right of way. The judgment enforces the easement by ordering the removal of obstructions on the Villaluz's property.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 204:**  Possibly, the crime of rendering an unjust judgment.
*   **Rules of Court (Appeal Period):**  Atty. Villaluz failed to perfect an appeal from the RTC decision within the prescribed period.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 18.03:** A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence shall render him liable.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Atty. Villaluz's Liability:** Suspended from the practice of law for six months due to negligence in failing to appeal the adverse judgment and filing a baseless administrative complaint against Judge Armenta.
*   **Clients' Loss of Remedy:** The Villaluz spouses are bound by the final and executory judgment and must grant the easement.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   Atty. Villaluz's explanation for his failure to appeal and for filing the complaints is inconsistent and not credible to the Court. There is a credibility issue surrounding the instructions given by the clients to counsel.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Guiang v. Antonio, 218 SCRA 381:** Cited to support the imposition of a six-month suspension for a lawyer's failure to perfect an appeal.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 650 and 652:** Easement of Right of Way
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 204:** Rendering Unjust Judgments.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 18.03**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court focused on Atty. Villaluz's professional negligence and abuse of administrative process in his attempt to overturn the adverse ruling on his clients. His failure to appeal the judgment and subsequent filing of the administrative case demonstrate a lack of diligence and respect for judicial processes, warranting disciplinary action.
