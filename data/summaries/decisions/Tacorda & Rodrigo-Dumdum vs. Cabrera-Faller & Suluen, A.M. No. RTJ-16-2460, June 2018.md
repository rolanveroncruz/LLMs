**Case Summary: *Atty. Jerome Norman L. Tacorda and Leticia Rodrigo-Dumdum v. Judge Perla V. Cabrera-Faller and Ophelia G. Suluen***

**Citation:** A.M. No. RTJ-16-2460, June 27, 2018 (834 Phil. 211)

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Judge Cabrera-Faller (Branch 90, RTC, Dasmari√±as City, Cavite) and her OIC/Legal Researcher Suluen, for Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Inefficiency, Delay in the Administration of Justice, and Impropriety, arising from delayed action on a Motion to Expunge a Pre-Trial Brief in Civil Case No. 398810.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law and Impropriety:** Dismissed. Complainants failed to demonstrate bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or corruption, or any gross and patent ignorance of the law. *See Ora v. Judge Almajar, 509 Phil. 595 (2005); Monticalbo v. Judge Maraya, Jr., 664 Phil. 1 (2011)*.
*   **Gross Inefficiency and Delay in the Administration of Justice (Judge Cabrera-Faller):**  Sustained. Judge Cabrera-Faller's failure to act on the Motion to Expunge for almost two years (from May 22, 2013, to July 31, 2015) constitutes unreasonable delay and a violation of the Constitution (Article VIII, Section 15) and the New Code of Judicial Conduct (Section 5, Canon 6). This failure directly relates to the principle that "justice delayed is justice denied" *See Section 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness*
*   **Liability of OIC/Legal Researcher Suluen:** Dismissed. The responsibility for resolving motions rests primarily with the judge, not the OIC/Legal Researcher.
*   **Sanction:** Judge Cabrera-Faller found guilty of Gross Inefficiency and Delay in the Administration of Justice and fined P20,000.00, to be deducted from any amounts due to her. (Note: The Court acknowledged Judge Cabrera-Faller had already been dismissed in prior cases: *Marcos v. Cabrera-Faller, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2472; Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabrera-Faller, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301*. Suluen had also been previously sanctioned in *Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabrera-Faller, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2301*.)

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to act promptly on motions and interlocutory matters. *Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1-88, 28 January 1988*.
*   Lower courts must decide cases or matters within three months from submission. *Article VIII, Section 15, Constitution*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Undue delay in rendering a decision or order constitutes a less serious offense under Section 9, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court.
*   Sanctions include suspension or a fine (Section 11, Rule 140, Revised Rules of Court).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigation of Liability:** Judge Cabrera-Faller's defense of re-raffling and mediation was deemed insufficient justification for the significant delay.  Defense counsel should be prepared to present compelling, documented extenuating circumstances beyond routine court processes.
*   **Consistency of Application:** The OCA's recommendation and the Court's ruling emphasize the judge's primary responsibility, but future cases may explore the extent to which legal researchers can be held accountable for failing to flag delayed matters, particularly if a clear directive or supervisory duty exists.
*   **Prior Offenses:** The Court took into account Judge Cabrera-Faller's prior dismissals and fines.  This highlights the importance of judicial officers maintaining ethical conduct and addressing previous disciplinary issues promptly.
*  **Impact of Delay:** Delay in the disposition of cases amounts to a denial of justice *See In Re: Compliance of Judge Maxwel S. Rosete, 479 Phil. 255 (2004)*
