## Legal Document Summary - *Cadalin, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 168923, November 28, 2008 (593 Phil. 170)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA decision in labor dispute.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** 2,019 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) listed by name in the document.
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Brown & Root International, Inc. (now Kellogg Brown & Root), Asia International Builders Corp., National Labor Relations Commission.

**Background:** Consolidated labor cases originating in 1984 involving money claims of OFWs recruited by AIBC and employed by BRII in Bahrain, specifically seeking benefits under Amiri Decree No. 23.  A prior Supreme Court decision ( *Cadalin v. POEA's Administrator*, 238 SCRA 721) affirmed an NLRC resolution, which, in part, remanded certain claims for further proceedings. The NLRC reversed its later decision that initially granted a significant monetary award (US$609,695,262.42) to a large group of claimants, leading to this petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Amiri Decree No. 23 (Bahrain):** Basis for some of the OFWs' claims. Specific benefits not detailed, but crucial for eligibility.
*   **NLRC Resolution of September 2, 1991:** Divides claimants into Annexes A, B, C, D, and E, each receiving a different treatment. Annex B claimants were ordered to be paid their claims. Annexes D & E were remanded for further proceedings.
*   **Compromise Agreements:** Many claimants entered into settlement agreements with AIBC and BRII. Validity of these agreements is a central issue.
*   **Article 291 of the Labor Code:** Statute of limitations for money claims (3 years).

**Liabilities & Monetary Awards:**

*   The NLRC's December 3, 2002, decision initially awarded a total of **US$609,695,262.42**, including:
    *   US$123,389,048.48 (Annex A: 665 Complainants)
    *   US$110,164,456.32 (Annex B: 558 Complainants)
    *   US$3,532,005.00 (Annex C: 1,975 Complainants - retirement pay benefits)
    *   US$256,032,910.58 (Legal Interest)
    *   US$61,150,000.00 (Moral and exemplary damages)
    *   US$55,426,842.04 (Attorney's Fees)
*   **The Supreme Court ultimately upheld only the claims of the 149 claimants listed in Annex "B" of the September 2, 1991, NLRC Resolution**. The amounts they received under the compromise agreements are to be deducted from their Annex B awards.
*    Also, the claims of 4 individuals (Serra, Diaz, Robles, and Macaraig) were awarded similar benefits granted to the Complainants in Annex "B".

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Prescription (Statute of Limitations):** Claims of many petitioners are barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Article 291 of the Labor Code. The 1,077 first-time claimants are most vulnerable on this issue. *See Cadalin v. POEA's Administrator*, 238 SCRA 721.
*   **Validity of Waivers/Quitclaims:** The validity of the compromise agreements, particularly those providing significantly lower settlements, is a major point of contention. *See Periquet v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 186 SCRA 724, for guidelines. Waivers from the 149 Annex "B" claimants with insufficient consideration are deemed void.
*   **"Similarly Situated" Claimants:** Attempts to include new claimants during the implementation phase by arguing they are "similarly situated" are largely rejected due to the lack of evidence and the res judicata effect of prior rulings.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** Claims of many petitioners are unsupported by sufficient evidence.  The burden of proof lies on the claimants.
*   **Attorneys Fees:** While the lower courts had ordered the respondents to pay attorneys fees, this matter was not reiterated in the Supreme Court's final decision.
*   **Duplication and Misspellings in List of Petitioners**- This opens up to questions of who is an actual complainant in this action.

**Outcome:**

*   Petition denied except as to the 149 Annex B claimants.
*   Compromise agreements and waivers deemed void *only* for Annex B claimants if the consideration was inadequate.
*   Unpaid amounts due to Annex B claimants and 4 individuals to be paid directly, with interest: 6% per annum from finality of prior Cadalin decision (December 5, 1994) to finality of this decision, then 12% per annum until actual payment.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Cadalin v. POEA's Administrator*, 238 SCRA 721 (prior SC decision on the same case)
*   *Surigao del Norte Electric Cooperative v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 368 Phil. 537 (1999) (NLRC can be liberal)
*   *Periquet v. National Labor Relations Commission*, 186 SCRA 724 (validity of quitclaims)
*   *Kathy-O Enterprises v. National Labor Relations Commission, 286 SCRA 729, 738-739 (1998).

**Legal Strategy Implication:** the lawyer should contact all 149 Annex B claimants to determine: (1) What was the total amount received? and (2) Calculate the legal interest.
