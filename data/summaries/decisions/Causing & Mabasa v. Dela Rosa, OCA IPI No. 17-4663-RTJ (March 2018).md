**Case Summary: *Atty. Berteni C. Causing and Percival Carag Mabasa v. Presiding Judge Jose Lorenzo R. Dela Rosa***

**Citation:** 827 Phil. 261 (OCA IPI No.17-4663-RTJ, March 07, 2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint filed by Atty. Causing and Percival Mabasa (Complainants) against Judge Dela Rosa for gross ignorance of the law, gross misconduct, and gross incompetence. The complaint stemmed from Judge Dela Rosa's reversal of a dismissal of libel cases against Mabasa.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Initial Dismissal & Reversal:** The libel cases were initially dismissed by Judge Disalo for violation of the accused's right to speedy trial. Judge Dela Rosa, upon motion for reconsideration by the prosecution, reversed this dismissal.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** Complainants allege that Judge Dela Rosa's reversal violated Mabasa's right against double jeopardy, as a dismissal for violation of the right to speedy trial is considered a dismissal on the merits.
*   **Facebook Posts/Sub Judice:** Complainants criticized Judge Dela Rosa's referral of Atty. Causing's Facebook and blogspot posts about the case to the IBP, arguing it violated the sub judice rule.
*   **Judge's Defense:** Judge Dela Rosa claimed he reversed his resolution prior to the complaint. Further, he argued Mabasa contributed to the delays, and his initial resolution was in good faith to allow the civil aspect of the libel cases to proceed.

**Legal Analysis and Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Double Jeopardy (Section 7, Rule 117, Rules of Court):** Complainants argue that the dismissal based on speedy trial violation is equivalent to an acquittal, barring further prosecution due to double jeopardy.
*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law:** The Court defines this as disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence (*Department of Justice v. Mislang*). Liability requires not only an erroneous order but also bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or corruption. (*Salvador v. Limsiaco, Jr.*).
*   **Power to Punish Contempt:** Judges are urged to exercise the power to punish contempt judiciously and sparingly, with utmost restraint, for the correction and preservation of the dignity of the Court, not for retaliation or vindictiveness. (*Lorenzo Shipping Corporation v. Distribution Management Association of the Philippines*)
*   **Motion for Reconsideration** The general rule states that the purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to grant an opportunity for the court to rectify any actual or perceived error attributed to it by re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case. (*Republic of the Philippines v. Abdulwahab A. Bayao, et al.*)

**Holding/Outcome:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the administrative complaint against Judge Dela Rosa.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Rectification of Error:** The Court agreed with the OCA that Judge Dela Rosa's subsequent reversal of his initial resolution negated the charge of gross ignorance.
*   **Lack of Bad Faith:** The Court found no evidence of bad faith, fraud, dishonesty, or corruption on Judge Dela Rosa's part.
*   **Proper Referral to IBP:** The Court upheld Judge Dela Rosa's referral of the Facebook posts to the IBP as a prudent and proper action.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Speedy Trial":** The core issue relies on whether the initial dismissal for violation of the right to speedy trial was indeed warranted. A more detailed investigation into the reasons for delay might have altered the outcome.
*   **Balancing Public Discourse and Sub Judice:** The Court's decision seems to favor judicial discretion in referring potential violations of the sub judice rule to the IBP, even without a formal show-cause order. This could potentially chill legitimate public discourse on legal issues.
*   **Reliance on Judge's Admission:** The court gives weight to the respondent Judge's admission that he had erred in issuing the November 23, 2015 Order, and to him rectifying such mistake.
