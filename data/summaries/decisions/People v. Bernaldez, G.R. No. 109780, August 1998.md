## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bernaldez, G.R. No. 109780 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting the accused, Rodolfo Bernaldez, of rape.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, committed against the accused's 10-year-old niece, Maria Teresa Bernaldez, on August 29, 1990.
*   **Evidence:** The RTC and the Supreme Court heavily relied on the positive identification and direct testimony of the victim, Maria Teresa.
*   **Defense:** The accused presented an alibi, claiming he was at work at the time of the crime. He also alleged the victim fabricated the charges to avoid punishment and to cover up an alleged affair of her mother. The Supreme Court found the alibi and the allegations against the victim incredible and unsubstantiated.
*   **Medical Certificate:** The RTC erroneously gave weight to a medical certificate without the testimony of the issuing physician (Dr. De la Paz). The Supreme Court correctly stated this was error.
*   **Materiality of Time:** The defense argued the date of the crime was essential. The Supreme Court correctly stated that precise time is not an essential element of rape, citing Rule 110, Section 11 of the Rules of Court and *People v. Molero*, 144 SCRA 397 (1986)

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The accused, Rodolfo Bernaldez, is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   He is liable to pay the victim, Maria Teresa, P50,000 in civil indemnity and P50,000 in moral damages. The Supreme Court modified the RTC decision by removing the exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence:** The trial court's initial reliance on the medical certificate without expert testimony presents a potential issue, although the Supreme Court deemed it harmless error as a medical examination is not indispensable in rape cases (*People v. Saldivia*, 203 SCRA 461 (1991)).
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** While the trial court initially imposed exemplary damages, the Supreme Court correctly reversed this.
*   **Age of victim:** The Supreme Court used the age of the victim to justify the lack of need for proof of force.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Alibi is always difficult to defend, and it was done ineffectively here.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape, especially relevant is paragraph 3 concerning victims under 12 years of age, rendering consent irrelevant.
*   **Rule 110, Section 11 of the Rules of Court:** Addresses the materiality of the time of commission of the offense.
*   **Article 2219 and Article 2230 of the Civil Code:** Pertain to the recovery of moral and exemplary damages, respectively.
*   **U.S. v. Dichao, 27 Phil. 421 (1914):** Cited by the appellant but distinguished by the Court, highlighting that the date must be certain enough to allow for the accused to prepare a defense.
*   **People v. Molero, 144 SCRA 397 (1986)**
*   **People v. Saldivia, 203 SCRA 461 (1991)**
*   **People v. Esquila, 254 SCRA 140 (1996):** Clarified the importance of the victim's positive identification of the accused.
*   **People v. Victor, G.R. No. 127903, 9 July 1998**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent. The facts are fairly straightforward, and the application of law is generally in accordance with established jurisprudence. The issues raised by the defense were adequately addressed and rejected by the Court.
