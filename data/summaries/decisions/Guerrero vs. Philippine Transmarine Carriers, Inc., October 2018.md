**Case Summary: Guerrero v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. (G.R. No. 222523)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the CA's decision affirming the NLRC's dismissal of Guerrero's complaint for permanent and total disability benefits against PTCI and Celebrity Cruises.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Claimant:** Jose John C. Guerrero, seafarer (Casino Dealer).
*   **Respondents:** Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. (PTCI), Celebrity Cruises (CC), and Carlos C. Salinas (PTCI President).
*   **Contract:** POEA Standard Employment Contract, providing terms and conditions for Filipino seafarers.
*   **Alleged Injury:** Lumbar Spondylosis diagnosed after MRI in the Caribbean. Guerrero claims it resulted from assisting an elderly passenger off the vessel in a wheelchair during heavy seas.
*   **Company's Position:** Injury resulted from a gym workout. They presented a "Crew Injury Statement" signed by Guerrero admitting to the gym incident.
*   **Medical Evaluations:**
    *   *Company-Designated Physician*: Dr. Catbagan performed surgery.
    *   *Seafarer's Physician*: Dr. Garcia declared Guerrero "UNFIT for further sea service" after a single consultation.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   *Labor Arbiter (LA)*: Ruled in favor of Guerrero, awarding disability benefits.
    *   *National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)*: Reversed the LA's decision, dismissing the case.
    *   *Court of Appeals (CA)*: Affirmed the NLRC's decision.
    *   *Supreme Court (SC)*: Affirmed the CA's and NLRC's decisions.

**Obligations:**

*   Under the POEA Standard Employment Contract, the employer (PTCI and CC) has the obligation to provide disability benefits for work-related injuries or illnesses sustained during the term of the employment contract.

**Liabilities:**

*   Guerrero sought to hold PTCI and CC jointly and severally liable for permanent and total disability benefits, compensatory, exemplary, and moral damages, and attorney's fees. The SC ultimately found no liability on the part of the respondents for disability benefits.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Work-Relatedness:** The core dispute revolves around whether Guerrero's injury was "work-related." The SC emphasized that Guerrero failed to provide substantial evidence linking his casino dealer duties to the lumbar disc injury.
*   **Inconsistent Statements:** Guerrero's changing versions of how he sustained the injury (wheelchair incident vs. gym incident) significantly undermined his credibility and case. This was a primary factor in the SC's decision.
*   **Medical Evidence:** The SC questioned the validity of Dr. Garcia's opinion, citing a lack of supporting diagnostic tests and procedures. The quick assessment (same-day consultation) raised concerns about its thoroughness.
*   **Belated Arguments:** Guerrero attempted to introduce new arguments (failure of the company-designated physician to issue a timely medical assessment) on appeal, which the SC disregarded as barred by estoppel.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **POEA Standard Terms and Conditions:** The SC relies heavily on this contract, impliedly incorporated into Guerrero's employment agreement, to define the scope of compensable disabilities.
*   **Substantial Evidence Rule:** The SC reinforces the requirement that the claimant must prove their claim with "substantial evidence," defined as relevant evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate. Ceriola v. NAESS Shipping Philippines, Inc., 758 Phil. 321, 337 (2015).
*   **Work-Related Injury:** Defined as injury resulting in disability or death "arising out of, and in the course of, employment," NYK-Fil Ship Management, Inc. v. Talavera, 591 Phil. 786, 800 (2008).
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC reiterates that certiorari is appropriate only when a lower tribunal acts with grave abuse of discretion, meaning a capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the dismissal of Guerrero's claim, primarily because he failed to prove that his injury was work-related. His inconsistent statements and the lack of credible medical evidence were detrimental to his case. The SC also emphasized that a claim for disability benefits must be supported by substantial evidence. This case underscores the importance of accurately documenting the cause of injuries and maintaining consistent narratives when pursuing compensation claims under the POEA contract.
