Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court Decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Philippine International Trading Corporation v. Threshold Pacific Corporation and Edgar Rey A. Cuales*, G.R. No. 209119, October 3, 2018 (841 Phil. 256)

**Facts:**

*   PITC (Petitioner), a government-owned corporation created under PD No. 252 and amended by PD No. 1071, sued TPC (Respondent) and Cuales (Respondent), its Managing Director, for sum of money based on an Import Financing Agreement (IFA) and its two addenda.
*   The IFA (July 5, 1993) involved PITC providing P50,000,000 to TPC to finance the latter's importation of urea fertilizer for resale to Allied Sugarcane Planters Association, Inc. (ASPAI). Security included ASPAI post-dated checks, land titles, and assignment of ASPAI's sugar quedans.
*   The 1st Addendum (July 6, 1993) allowed PITC to disburse an initial P6,000,000 for TPC to purchase fertilizer locally due to importation delays. PITC opened a Letter of Credit to La Filipina Uy Gongco Corp.
*   The 2nd Addendum (November 4, 1993) allowed a second disbursement of P5,000,000 for domestic fertilizer purchase. PITC issued a check directly to TPC, who issued a promissory note solidarily with Cuales.
*   ASPAI's checks bounced. PITC sued TPC and Cuales, alleging breach of contract, failure to submit the Noah's Ark Sugar Holding's conforme and failure to pay.

**Procedural History:**

*   RTC: Ruled in favor of PITC, holding TPC liable for the first tranche and TPC & Cuales solidarily liable for the second, plus attorney's fees. The RTC rejected the agency defense.
*   CA: Reversed the RTC, finding the IFA and addenda were simulated. The CA held that TPC and Cuales were mere agents of ASPAI and not liable for ASPAI's default.

**Issues:**

1.  Was the transaction between PITC and TPC?
2.  Was the IFA and its addenda simulated?
3.  Is PITC entitled to attorney's fees?

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA decision and reinstated the RTC's ruling. The transaction was between PITC and TPC, and the IFA was *not* simulated. PITC is entitled to attorney's fees, as modified by the RTC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **IFA:** Establishes a loan agreement between PITC and TPC. TPC obligated to repay the P50,000,000 loan with interest. Security provided by TPC included checks from ASPAI, land titles, and assigned sugar quedans.
*   **Addenda:** Modifications to the disbursement schedule, allowing local purchases of fertilizer instead of importation. The 2nd Addendum includes a promissory note from TPC (signed by Cuales) for solidary liability.
*   **Default Clause (IFA):** Failure of ASPAI checks to clear, failure to perform the agreement, or failure to repay the loan triggers immediate demandability.
*   **Attorney's Fees (IFA):** Clause stipulates 25% of the total sum claimed, but reduced by the RTC.

**Liabilities:**

*   TPC: Primary liability for the loan based on the IFA and addenda.
*   Cuales: Solidary liability for the P5,000,000 second disbursement per the promissory note.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Contract Interpretation:** The SC applies the parol evidence rule, acknowledging an exception if the written agreement fails to express the true intent. However, respondents failed to prove simulation.
*   **No Agency:** There was no express agency agreement in the document. The Court required a special power of attorney to prove agency and said it must be direct, categorical and cannot be lightly implied.
*   **Burden of Proof:** TPC and Cuales failed to overcome the presumption of regularity and validity of a notarized loan agreement with clear and convincing evidence.
*   **Parol Evidence Insufficiency:** Contemporaneous and subsequent acts (ASPAI issuing checks, mortgages, etc.) do not establish agency. Cuales's testimony was deemed self-serving. Respondents TPC & Cuales failed to adduce a special power of attorney to prove that they had an agency relation with ASPAI.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Enforceable based on the contractual stipulation, but the RTC's reduction to a fixed amount was upheld because PITC didn't appeal the amount.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Recovering the debt from TPC may be difficult if TPC lacks assets.
*   **Third-Party Claims:** ASPAI may have claims related to the fertilizer delivery or quality, potentially leading to further litigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree Nos. 252 & 1071:** Creation and powers of PITC.
*   **Civil Code Articles 1159, 1305, 1306, 1370, 1371, 1869, 1878, 1953:** Governs contracts, agency, and loans.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 9:** Parol Evidence Rule and its exceptions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 3:** Legal Presumptions.
*   *Strong v. Repide*, 6 Phil. 680 (1906); *Lim Pin v. Liao Tan*, 200 Phil. 685 (1982) (express and implied agency).
*   *Patrimonio v. Gutierrez*, 735 Phil. 146 (2014) (verbal grant of authority for a specific act).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The 2nd Addendum, which included a promissory note solidarily with Cuales may be contentious, the SC held him personally liable.

**Conclusion:**

This case emphasizes the importance of clear contractual language and the heavy burden of proof required to overcome the written terms of a valid, notarized agreement. TPC is bound by the terms of the IFA and its addenda, and Cuales is solidarily liable for the second disbursement per the promissory note. PITC is entitled to attorney's fees, but subject to the RTC's reduced amount.
