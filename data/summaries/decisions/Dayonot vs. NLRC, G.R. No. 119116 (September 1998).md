**Case:** *Crisanto Dayonot vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Autographics Inc., Paul Y. Rodriguez and Eugene L. Topacio* G.R. No. 119116, September 03, 1998 (356 Phil. 427)

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute over the execution of a final and executory judgment in an illegal dismissal case. Petitioner Dayonot, the prevailing party, sought to enforce the judgment by levying and selling a property belonging to the private respondents (Autographics Inc. et al.).  The validity of the auction sale and subsequent certificate of sale is the central issue.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Final Judgment:** A prior decision in favor of the Petitioner for illegal dismissal, including backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, had become final and executory.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** Writs of execution were issued to satisfy the judgment. Sheriff Tolo levied property and conducted an auction sale.
*   **Certificate of Sale:** Sheriff Tolo issued a Certificate of Auction Sale to the Petitioner. Petitioner then sought a Certificate of Definite Deed of Sale.
*   **Redemption Period:** The Petitioner argued the one-year redemption period had lapsed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Original Debtors (Autographics Inc. et al.):** Initially liable for the monetary judgment in the illegal dismissal case.
*   **Potential Liability of Sheriff Tolo:** If he acted improperly and harmed the Respondents, a legal suit may exist for the same.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Auction Sale:**  The primary risk is the invalidity of the auction sale. The NLRC annulled the Certificate of Sale, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court.
*   **Sheriff's Authority:** The dispositive issue is that Sheriff Tolo was no longer a sheriff at the time of the auction sale, issuance of the certificate, and notarization. This renders his actions *void ab initio*.
*   **Petitioner's Failure to Follow Procedure:** The SC noted that the petitioner failed to provide crucial dates per SC Circular No. 1-88, providing an independent basis for dismissal.
*   **Finality of Judgment (Procedural Issue):** The SC noted that the NLRC decision had become final and executory, potentially barring the petition.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Manila Bay Club Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, et. al. (G.R. No. 110015, October 13, 1995):** Cited regarding the adverse inference created by a party's failure to rebut an allegation. This was used against Dayonot for not refuting Tolo's absence.
*   **SC Circular No. 1-88:** Mandates the inclusion of specific dates in petitions for certiorari; failure is grounds for dismissal.
*   **NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment:**  The NLRC decision ordered the Sheriff of the Regional Arbitration Branch to take appropriate action according to this manual.
*   **Rules of Court** (implicitly referenced regarding execution of judgments and redemption periods).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There is no clause per se, but the core contention is the *legal effect* of an auction sale conducted by someone without legal authority. Specifically, can this failure to comply with the law be cured retroactively.

**Analysis/Recommendations:**

*   **Validity of the Sale:** The sale is likely invalid due to the unauthorized actions of the sheriff.  *Nemo dat quod non habet* - one cannot give what one does not have.
*   **Potential Remedies:**
    *   The Labor Arbiter must issue a *valid* writ of execution and a qualified sheriff must properly re-levy and re-sell the property.
    *   Petitioner may have a claim against Sheriff Tolo for acting without authority.
*   **Risk Mitigation:** Ensure strict compliance with procedural rules (SC Circular No. 1-88) and the NLRC manual on the re-execution of the judgment. Focus on securing the appointment of an authorized sheriff.
