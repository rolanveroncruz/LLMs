**Case Summary: *Florencio R. Bernabe v. Zenaida C. Grimaldo*, A.M. No. P-08-2453, February 2, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Zenaida C. Grimaldo, a Court Stenographer III, for acts prejudicial to the best interest of public service.

**Key Facts:**

*   Grimaldo received P130,000.00 from complainant Florencio Bernabe and his sister, Susana Bernabe Fuentes, to facilitate the transfer and subdivision of inherited properties. She provided receipts.
*   She failed to complete the transfer, leading to a demand letter and a promissory note that she also failed to honor.
*   Grimaldo admitted receiving the money but claimed inability to repay due to her husband's medical emergency and death.
*   Previously disciplined for (1) willful failure to pay a debt in *Rural Bank of Balagtas v. Grimaldo*, A.M. No. P-91-591 and (2) for asking money to facilitate the reconstitution of land titles in *Pedro Roque et al. v. Grimaldo*, A.M. Nos. P-95-1148 and 1149 where she was fined one-month's salary and warned.

**Holding:** Grimaldo was found GUILTY of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of public service and DISMISSED from service. She was also ordered to return P115,000.00 to the complainants.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Obligation:** Grimaldo had an obligation to maintain a hands-off attitude regarding matters outside her official duties as a court stenographer. (*Roque v. Grimaldo*, citing the Investigating Judge's report).
*   **Obligation:** Judiciary employees must exercise prudence and avoid conduct that could diminish public faith in the judiciary.
*   **Obligation:** The Court found her actions in offering to facilitate the transfers and accepting the money a violation of established norms, creating the impression she could leverage her position for personal gain.
*   **Obligation:**  Return the balance of P115,000.00 to the complainant and his sister.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Dismissal from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits.
*   **Monetary Liability:** Obligation to repay P115,000.00 (P65,000 to Florencio R. Bernabe and P50,000 to Susana Bernabe Fuentes). Failure to comply could lead to contempt of court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** Failure to return the money as ordered.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule IV, Section 52(A)(20) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Defines "conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service" and the corresponding penalties.
*   **Section 52(B)(2) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Specifies dismissal for a second offense of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   ***Rural Bank of Balagtas v. Grimaldo*, A.M. No. P-91-591:** Prior administrative case where Grimaldo was found guilty of willful failure to pay a debt.
*   ***Pedro Roque et al. v. Grimaldo*, A.M. Nos. P-95-1148 and 1149:** Prior administrative case where Grimaldo was charged with asking money to facilitate the reconstitution of land titles.
*   ***Vilar v. Angeles, A.M. No. P-06-2276*** reinforces the court's duty to discipline errant employees.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The admission and circumstances surrounding Grimaldo's acceptance of money "to facilitate" the transfer of titles is a key contentious point, as it suggests an abuse of her position.  The phrase "facilitate the transfer" is critical as the Court interpreted this as implying influence peddling due to her court position.

**Legally Precise Concerns:**

*   The Court relied heavily on the precedent set by *Roque v. Grimaldo*, highlighting the importance of consistency in disciplinary actions.
*   The penalty imposed (dismissal) is significant and reflects the Court's strict stance against any conduct that may erode public trust.
* The previous disciplinary actions played a significant role in the court's decision to dismiss Grimaldo, indicating the importance of prior warnings and offenses.
