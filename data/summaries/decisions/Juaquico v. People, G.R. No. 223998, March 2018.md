**Case Summary: *Juaquico v. People*, G.R. No. 223998 (2018)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether Petitioner is guilty of Estafa under Article 315(2)(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for issuing checks that were later dishonored due to insufficient funds.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and acquitted the Petitioner on the ground of reasonable doubt, but held him civilly liable for the amount of the dishonored checks.

**Key Provisions and Elements of Estafa under Art. 315(2)(d) RPC:**

*   Issuance of a check in payment of an obligation.
*   Lack of or insufficiency of funds.
*   **Crucially:** Payee not informed, and unaware, of the insufficient funds.

**Reasoning:**

*   The Prosecution failed to prove that the Petitioner *knew* the drawer (Ham) had insufficient funds when he endorsed the checks to the private complainant. This is a key element per *Ilagan v. People*, 550 Phil. 791 (2007).
*   The long-standing business relationship between the parties and the complainant's practice of accepting checks from the petitioner's clients, even without personally knowing them, negated any fraudulent intent on the part of the petitioner. The complainant was not deceived, per *Lim v. People*, 748 Phil. 649 (2014).
*   While acquitted, the Petitioner was found to have unjustly benefited and is thus liable for the value of the dishonored checks in the amount of P329,000 as actual damages.

**Civil Liability:**

*   P329,000 actual damages.
*   Legal interest of 12% per annum from October 17, 1991 (date of demand letter) until June 30, 2013.
*   Legal interest of 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction, based on *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013) and BSP Resolution No. 796.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Scienter:** The core of the acquittal rests on the prosecution's failure to prove the *mens rea* element - that Juaquico *knew* the checks were bad when he passed them. The fact that he tried to locate Ham after the checks bounced bolsters his defense.
*   **Civil Liability Calculation:** The calculation of interest is crucial. Ensure compliance with *Nacar* and BSP guidelines for proper computation.
*   **Collection:** Enforceability of the civil judgment might present challenges depending on Juaquico's assets and financial situation.
