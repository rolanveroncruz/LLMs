**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 227388, *Republic v. Manahan-Jazmines***

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari seeking reversal of CA decision affirming RTC grant of land registration application under P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1) and C.A. No. 141, Sections 11(4) and 48(b).

**Key Provisions:**
*   **P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1):** Original registration of title for those in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a *bona fide* claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.
*   **C.A. No. 141, Sections 11(4) and 48(b):**  Confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles via judicial legalization. Specifically, Section 48(b) echoes the P.D. 1529 requirement of possession since June 12, 1945 or earlier.

**Obligations:**
*   Applicant (Manahan-Jazmines) must prove: (1) land is alienable and disposable; (2) open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession by applicant/predecessors-in-interest under *bona fide* claim of ownership; (3) such possession since June 12, 1945 or earlier.

**Liabilities:**
*   Failure to prove the elements under P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1) and C.A. 141, Sections 11(4) and 48(b) will result in denial of the land registration application.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Insufficient Proof of Possession:** The Supreme Court found that the applicant did not adequately demonstrate open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945.  Testimonial evidence was deemed self-serving and unsubstantiated.
*   **Intermittent Residency:**  Applicantâ€™s move to Sampaloc, Manila in 1954 and infrequent visits to the land were interpreted as a lack of continuous possession.
*   **Sporadic Tax Declarations:** Tax declarations dating back only to 1965 and infrequent payment of taxes weakens claim.  Absence of explanation for the lack of earlier tax declarations.
*   **Lack of Improvement/Cultivation:** Lack of evidence showing continuous cultivation or presence of permanent structures. MARO Certification stating land as idle further undermined the claim.
*   **CENRO Certification:** While the CA relied on the CENRO certification that land is alienable and disposable and judicially noted Proclamation No. 1637, the Supreme Court focused primarily on the lack of continuous possession as the basis for the denial.
*   **Estoppel:** The applicant argued that the Republic was estopped from assailing the CENRO certification as it was admitted by the public prosecutor. The Supreme Court did not address this argument as it relied on the lack of continuous possession in denying the registration.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14(1)**
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141, Sections 11(4) and 48(b).**
*   **Republic v. T.A.N. Properties, Inc. (578 Phil. 441 (2008)):** Cited by the CA regarding alienable and disposable lands, judicial notice of Proclamation No. 1637.
*   **Wee v. Republic (622 Phil. 944 (2009)):** Mere casual cultivation does not amount to exclusive and notorious possession.
*   **Republic v. Lualhati (757 Phil. 119 (2015)):** Testimony of mere casual cultivation, without any specific detail regarding the manner of cultivating cannot establish the bona fide claim of ownership.
*   **Republic v. Estate of Santos (G.R. No. 218345, December 7, 2016):** incomplete tax declarations; earliest of these tax declarations dated back to 1949 only, short of the requirement that possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership should be from June 12, 1945 or even earlier.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, denying the land registration application due to the applicant's failure to adequately prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the subject lots since June 12, 1945, as required by P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1) and C.A. No. 141, Sections 11(4) and 48(b). Key factors included the applicant's move from the property, sporadic tax declarations, and a lack of evidence of consistent cultivation or improvement.
