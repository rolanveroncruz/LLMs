**Case Summary: *Lee Tek Sheng v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115402, July 15, 1998***

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the trial court's denial of a motion to cancel a notice of lis pendens.

**Facts:** Petitioner (son) filed suit against private respondent (father) for partition of alleged conjugal properties. Respondent counterclaimed that certain properties registered solely in Petitioner's name were actually conjugal properties held in trust by Petitioner for the conjugal partnership. Respondent annotated a notice of lis pendens on the titles of those properties. Petitioner moved to cancel the lis pendens, arguing it constituted a collateral attack on his title.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Main Issue:** Propriety of denying the motion to cancel the notice of lis pendens.
*   **Collateral Attack Doctrine (PD 1529, Sec. 48):** Petitioner argued the notice of lis pendens was an impermissible collateral attack on his Torrens title. The Court clarifies that the prohibition is against attacking the *certificate* of title, not the *title* (ownership) itself. The TCT is only the *best evidence* of ownership, not conclusive proof.
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens:** The Court reiterates the purpose of a notice of lis pendens is to inform the public that the property is subject to litigation, warning potential buyers. *Sajonas v. CA, 258 SCRA 79*.
*   **Cancellation of Lis Pendens (PD 1529, Sec. 77; Rule 13, Sec. 14, Rules of Civil Procedure):** The Court states that cancellation is only proper if the annotation was for the purpose of molesting the adverse party, or when the annotation is not necessary to protect the rights of the party who caused it to be recorded. Neither ground was established.
*   **Partition Suit (Rule 69, Sec. 1, Rules of Civil Procedure):** The Court held the issue of ownership must be resolved *before* partition can be effected. The court in a partition case has the power and duty to inquire into the nature and extent of the parties' title. Evidence of ownership is admissible, *Catapusan v. CA, 264 SCRA 534*.
*   **Reconveyance:** Respondent's counterclaim for reconveyance puts ownership directly in issue.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent has the obligation to prove that the properties registered under Petitioner's name are actually conjugal properties.
*   Any party dealing with the property is bound by the outcome of the litigation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Petitioner risks losing sole ownership of the properties if Respondent successfully proves the properties are conjugal.
*   Third parties acquiring interest in the property risk losing their investment if the Respondent prevails.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   PD 1529, Sec. 32: Incontrovertibility of title after one year (though the court qualifies this in terms of questioning actual ownership).
*   PD 1529, Sec. 48: Prohibition against collateral attacks on certificates of title.
*   PD 1529, Sec. 77: Grounds for cancellation of notice of lis pendens.
*   Rule 13, Sec. 14, Rules of Civil Procedure: Similar to Sec. 77 PD 1529 regarding lis pendens cancellation.
*   Rule 69, Sec. 1, Rules of Civil Procedure: Complaint in action for partition of real estate.
*   *Halili v. NLRC, 257 SCRA 174*: Certificate of title cannot be collaterally attacked.
*   *Catapusan v. CA, 264 SCRA 534*: Ownership must be resolved prior to partition.
* *Sajonas v. CA, 258 SCRA 79*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None explicitly stated, but the dispute centers around the interpretation of "collateral attack" and whether a challenge to *ownership* constitutes an attack on the *certificate* of title.
*   The ambiguity is the scope of what the courts can decide in a partition case. The Petitioner argues that ownership cannot be decided, but the Respondent's counterclaim effectively requires the Court to decide on it.
* **Pre-trial agreement**: The issue of what properties were acquired during marriage was a pre-trial issue, so deciding on it would not be going beyond the case.

**Conclusion:** The Court upheld the denial of the motion to cancel the notice of lis pendens, emphasizing that the core issue is ownership which *can* be determined in a partition case. The annotation serves its purpose of notifying the public of the pending litigation. The petitioner's argument regarding collateral attack is misplaced as it concerns the *certificate* of title, not the *title* (ownership).
