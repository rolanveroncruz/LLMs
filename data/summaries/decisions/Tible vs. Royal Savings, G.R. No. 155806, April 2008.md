**Case Summary: Tible & Tible Company, Inc. vs. Royal Savings and Loan Association (G.R. No. 155806, April 8, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45) of a Court of Appeals (CA) Resolution dismissing a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) on procedural grounds. The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan Agreement & Mortgages:** Tible & Tible (TTCI) obtained a loan (P1,500,080.00) from Royal Savings & Loan Association (RSLA), secured by chattel mortgages on logging equipment and logs.
*   **Default & Compromise Agreement:** TTCI defaulted, leading to a court-approved compromise agreement (Civil Case No. 2893) where TTCI admitted indebtedness of P2,428,290.20, to be paid in installments.
*   **Execution:** TTCI again defaulted, and RSLA obtained a writ of execution (and later an alias writ).  RSLA purchased 23 parcels of land at public auction for P950,000.00.
*   **Subsequent Actions:**  Years later, Comsavings Bank (successor to RSLA) obtained an order for the Register of Deeds to cancel existing titles and issue new ones in its name. TTCI filed an action for Annulment of Execution Sale/Reconveyance (Civil Case No. RTC-96-3626 in Naga, later Civil Case No. N-6619 in Cavite). The Naga RTC dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  The Cavite RTC also dismissed, prompting the failed CA Certiorari petition.

**Issues & Ruling:**

1.  **Propriety of Remedy:** The SC affirmed that the proper remedy for challenging the RTC decision was an ordinary appeal (Rule 41), not a petition for certiorari (Rule 65).  Certiorari is only appropriate when there is no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and where a tribunal acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. The errors alleged were not jurisdictional.
2.  **Procedural Defects in Certiorari Petition:**  Even if certiorari *were* the correct remedy, the petition filed was defective because:
    *   **Verification & Non-Forum Shopping:** The Verification Affidavit of Non-Forum Shopping was signed by only one petitioner (Almabella Menla Vda. de Tible) without proper authorization (Special Power of Attorney, Board Resolution, or Secretary's Certificate) to represent the other petitioners.
    *   **Service by Mail:**  The petition was served by mail without a written explanation justifying the failure to effect personal service.
    *   **Subsequent Compliance:**  Late submission of the required documentation did not cure the initial defects. *Athena Computers, Inc. v. Reyes, G.R. No. 156905, September 5, 2007* and *Digital Microwave Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128550, March 16, 2000* were cited to highlight the need for strict compliance with rules on certification against forum shopping.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **TTCI:** Obligation to repay the loan amount as stipulated in the compromise agreement.  Potential loss of property due to foreclosure and execution.
*   **Comsavings Bank:**  Obligation to comply with all legal procedures in the execution and foreclosure process.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **TTCI:** Foreclosure of mortgages remains valid due to the SC decision. They are likely to lose ownership of the auctioned properties.  Potential for further legal action to collect any remaining deficiency balance on the loan.
*   **Comsavings Bank:**  Risk of future challenges to the execution sale if procedural irregularities exist (beyond the scope of this case).  Risk of challenges related to the fairness of the auction process or the valuation of the properties.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 41 (Appeals), Rule 46, Section 3 (Verification and Non-Forum Shopping), Rule 13, Section 11 (Service of Pleadings). *Madrigal Transport, Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation, G.R. No. 156067, August 11, 2004*: Distinguished Certiorari from Appeal

No. 156905, September 5, 2007* *Digital Microwave Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128550, March 16, 2000* *Solar Team Entertainment v. Ricafort, G.R. No. 132007, August 5, 1998*. *Batoy v. Regional Trial Court, Br. 50, Loay, Bohol, G.R. No. 126833, February 17, 2003* *Suzuki v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 146979, July 27, 2006*. *Ortiz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127393, December 4, 1998* *Pet Plans, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 148287, November 23, 2004*

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The fairness and regularity of the original execution sale are implicitly questioned, given the delay in issuing the final deed of sale. However, the SC did not delve into the factual validity, only the procedural impropriety of the *certiorari* petition. The fact that the properties are in various locations adds to the complexity of the case.
*   TTCI claimed that the compromise agreement should be considered null due to the original loan not going through proper channels.

**Conclusion:**

The SC upheld the dismissal of the Certiorari petition due to TTCI's failure to pursue the proper remedy (appeal) and non-compliance with procedural requirements. The ruling reinforces the importance of adhering to the Rules of Court and highlights the limited scope of certiorari as an extraordinary remedy.
