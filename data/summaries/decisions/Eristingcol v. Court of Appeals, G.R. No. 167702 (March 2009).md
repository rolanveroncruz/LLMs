**Case Summary: *Eristingcol v. Court of Appeals and Limjoco*, G.R. No. 167702, March 20, 2009**

**Facts:**

*   Eristingcol, a homeowner in Urdaneta Village, filed suit in the RTC against UVAI (Urdaneta Village Association, Inc.) and its officers, including Limjoco, challenging UVAI's Construction Rules and Regulations (CRR), specifically regarding setback lines and a P400,000 penalty imposed for alleged violations related to a canopy extension. Eristingcol claimed the penalty was unwarranted and the CRR contrary to law, seeking its declaration of nullity.
*   UVAI moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing the Home Insurance Guaranty Corporation (HIGC), now the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), had jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes involving homeowners associations per E.O. 535 and E.O. 90.
*   RTC denied the motion, invoking *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* based on UVAI's alleged estoppel due to its initial appearance and agreement to an Undertaking.
*   CA reversed, holding the RTC lacked jurisdiction and dismissing Eristingcol's complaint.

**Issue:**

*   Whether the RTC or the HLURB has jurisdiction over Eristingcol's complaint.

**Holding:**

*   HLURB has jurisdiction. CA affirmed.

**Rationale:**

*   **Nature of the Action:** While nominally a "declaration of nullity," the core issue is the *interpretation and application* of UVAI's CRR, specifically the setback line rules, to Eristingcol's property. This implicates the internal rules and regulations of a homeowners association concerning a member.
*   **Intra-Corporate Dispute:** The controversy arose because Eristingcol, as a member of UVAI, sought exemption from the CRR.
*   **HIGC/HLURB Jurisdiction:** E.O. 535 and RA 8763 vested the HIGC (now HLURB) with jurisdiction over disputes involving homeowners associations, including those arising from intra-corporate relations. *China Banking Corp. v. CA* provides that the interpretation of a corporation's bylaws falls within the SEC's (and subsequently the HLURB's) special competence.
*   **Distinction from *Sta. Clara Homeowners' Association v. Sps. Gaston***: In *Sta. Clara*, jurisdiction rested with the regular courts because there was no privity of contract between the parties, as the homeowners were not members of the association.  Here, the court found a privity of contract.
*   ***Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* Inapplicable:** UVAI's appearance and signing of the Undertaking did not constitute laches barring their jurisdictional challenge. The motion to dismiss was filed relatively soon after the temporary settlement was reached. The actions that were alleged to constitute estoppel where insufficient to meet the high bar set for estoppel to block a valid challenge for subject matter jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **UVAI's Construction Rules and Regulations (CRR):** Specifically, the provisions regarding setback lines and the power to impose penalties for violations.
*   **E.O. 535 and RA 8763:** These laws transfer regulatory and administrative functions over homeowners associations from the SEC to the HIGC/HLURB, including jurisdiction over intra-corporate disputes.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Impact of Non-Joinder:** The Court nearly dismissed the appeal due to Eristingcol's failure to implead all parties from the CA case. The decision to proceed on the merits might be viewed as discretionary and not setting a firm precedent.
*   **"Declaration of Nullity" Misnomer:** Litigants should be cautious about framing cases as "declarations of nullity" when the true substance involves internal rules of homeowners associations. Courts will look beyond the label to determine jurisdiction.

**Case Law Cited:**

*   *Viray v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 92481, November 9, 1990, 191 SCRA 308, 323*
*   *Citibank v. CA, 359 Phil. 719 (1998).*
*   *Bokingo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 161739, May 4, 2006, 489 SCRA 521, 530*
*   *China Banking Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 337 Phil. 223 (1997)*.
*   *Sta. Clara Homeowners' Association v. Sps. Gaston, 425 Phil. 221 (2002)*.
*   *Tijam, et al. v. Sibonghanoy, et al., 131 Phil. 556 (1968)*.

**Statutory References:**

*   **E.O. 535:** Amends Republic Act No. 580, transferring regulatory powers over homeowners associations to the HIGC.
*   **RA 8763:** Transfers powers and responsibilities vested in the HIGC with respect to homeowners' associations, to the HLURB.
*   **Presidential Decree 902-A, Sec. 5(b).**
*   **Article 19 of the Civil Code**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court definitively holds that the HLURB, not the RTC, has jurisdiction over disputes arising from the application of homeowners association rules to its members. Attempting to frame such disputes as "declarations of nullity" will not circumvent the jurisdictional mandate of the HLURB.
