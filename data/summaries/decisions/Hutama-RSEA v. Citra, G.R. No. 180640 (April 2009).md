## Legal Document Summary: *HUTAMA-RSEA Joint Operations, Inc. v. Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corporation* (G.R. No. 180640)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting a Court of Appeals (CA) decision annulling an Order of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) and enjoining CIAC from proceeding with CIAC Case No. 17-2005.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** HUTAMA-RSEA Joint Operations, Inc. (Sub-contractor)
*   **Respondent:** Citra Metro Manila Tollways Corporation (General Contractor/Operator)

**Key Provision:** Engineering Procurement Construction Contract (EPCC) between Petitioner and Respondent for the South Metro Manila Skyway Project. The EPCC contains an arbitration clause (Clause 20.6) and a clause requiring initial referral of disputes to a Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) (Clause 20.4).

**Issue:** Does the CIAC have jurisdiction over the dispute, given the arbitration clause in the EPCC and despite the petitioner's failure to first refer the dispute to the DAB as stipulated in Clause 20.4?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the Petition, reversed the CA decision, and remanded the case to CIAC, holding that CIAC *does* have jurisdiction, irrespective of prior referral to the DAB.

**Reasoning:**

*   **CIAC Jurisdiction:** Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) No. 1008 (Construction Industry Arbitration Law) and Section 1, Article III of the CIAC Rules of Procedure confer original and exclusive jurisdiction on CIAC over construction contract disputes where the contract contains an arbitration clause.
*   **Arbitration Clause Trumps DAB Referral:**  The presence of an arbitration clause in a construction contract automatically vests CIAC with jurisdiction.  This is true *notwithstanding* any reference in the contract to a different arbitration institution or arbitral body (as stated in Section 1, Article III, CIAC Rules).
*   **DAB Referral Not a Condition Precedent:** Non-compliance with Clause 20.4 (DAB referral) does not negate CIAC's jurisdiction. To require it would conflict with the intent of EO 1008 to expedite construction dispute resolution. The Supreme Court held that the arbitration clause in a construction contract ipso facto vested the CIAC with jurisdiction, which cannot be subjected to any condition.
*   **Case Law:** The SC cites *China Chang Jiang Energy Corporation (Philippines) v. Rosal Infrastructure Builders* and *National Irrigation Administration v. Court of Appeals* to support the principle that agreeing to voluntary arbitration is sufficient for CIAC jurisdiction, regardless of any specific forum chosen in the contract.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Waiver:** While the SC holds that the arbitration clause grants CIAC jurisdiction, a dissenting argument could be that the petitioner implicitly waived its right to directly access CIAC by agreeing to the EPCC's dispute resolution process (DAB first). However, the SC expressly rejects this argument by stating CIAC jurisdiction "cannot be subjected to any condition; nor can it be waived or diminished by the stipulation, act or omission of the parties."
*   **Enforceability of DAB Decision (Hypothetical):** The SC does not address the hypothetical situation where a DAB *was* constituted and rendered a decision, but one party refused to comply. Clause 20.7 suggests a separate arbitration could be commenced solely on the issue of non-compliance, raising potential procedural complications that are not addressed by this decision.
*   **Counterclaims:** While CIAC now has jurisdiction, the respondent's potential counterclaims for liquidated damages (as outlined in the Terms of Reference) still need to be considered by CIAC.

**Conclusion:**

This case affirms the broad jurisdiction of CIAC over construction disputes in the Philippines. The SC prioritizes efficiency and the intent of EO 1008 by holding that a standard arbitration clause in a construction contract grants CIAC jurisdiction, and overrides clauses requiring initial referral of disputes to a Dispute Adjudication Board. This ruling may impact contract drafting strategy, as parties seeking to mandate DAB referral may need to explicitly waive CIAC jurisdiction, the validity of which is potentially questionable given the SC's pronouncements.
