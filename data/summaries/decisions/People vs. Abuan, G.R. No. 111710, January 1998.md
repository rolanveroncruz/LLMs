## Legal Document Summary: People v. Abuan, G.R. No. 111710 (1998)

**Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision finding Rogelio Abuan guilty of rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**
*   Accused-Appellant Rogelio Abuan was charged with raping Rosita Villanueva, a 13-year-old girl, on April 8, 1992.
*   The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimony of the victim, Rosita, alleging force and intimidation.

**Defense:**
*   Accused-appellant raised an alibi, claiming he was in Baguio City at the time of the alleged rape.
*   The defense also questioned the credibility of the victim's testimony, pointing out inconsistencies and delay in reporting.
*   Delia, the victim's sister and daughter-in-law of the accused, testified that the victim was in their parentâ€™s house with her on the night of the alleged rape.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**
*   The RTC initially found Abuan guilty and liable for civil indemnity (P40,000) and expenses/costs (P7,000)
*   However, on appeal, the Supreme Court **reversed** the RTC decision and acquitted Abuan due to reasonable doubt.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** Discrepancies between the victim's affidavit and court testimony regarding how she ended up at the accused's house, raising questions about the use of force and intimidation.
*   **Delayed Reporting:** The three-month delay between the alleged rape and the formal complaint raised concerns about the veracity of the claim, similar to issues raised in *People v. Teves, 246 SCRA 237 (1995)*, in which the court scrutinized the testimony of the complaining witness due to delay.
*   **Medical Evidence:** While healed hymenal lacerations were found, a vaginal smear was negative for spermatozoa, failing to provide conclusive evidence of recent sexual intercourse.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Conflicting testimonies between victim, Delia, Lorina, and Rogelio.
*   **Alibi Evidence:** Corroborating testimonies for alibi of the accused-appellant were only from relatives, which were considered by the court to be not entirely satisfactory.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Art. 335, Revised Penal Code:** Defines the crime of rape and its penalties.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The Supreme Court emphasizes the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases, referencing *People v. Godoy, 250 SCRA 676 (1995)*, stating that the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.
*   **Credibility of Complainant's Testimony:** The Court cites that the crime of rape conviction depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony, referencing *People v. Teves, 246 SCRA 237 (1995)*.
*   **Reaction to Crime:** *People v. Sinatao, 249 SCRA 554 (1995)*: the SC cited the unreasonable action of the complianant to flee only within the 30 meter proximity of the crime scene.

**Potential Risks:**
*   The original RTC decision resulted in a conviction and significant penalties.
*   However, the Supreme Court's reversal demonstrates the importance of credible and consistent evidence in rape cases.
*   The case highlights the potential for wrongful convictions based on unreliable testimony.
