**Case:** *Maycel Balucero Nanzan v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 262084, April 03, 2024)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Maycel Balucero Nanzan (Nanzan) guilty of "other deceits" under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), stemming from a bridge financing loan obtained from Oaña Credit Solutions, Inc. The original charge was Estafa under Art. 315, 2(a) of the RPC.  The CA modified the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision. Nanzan misrepresented that the loan would be repaid from a pre-approved PS Bank loan. The loan was granted based on this representation, but the PS Bank proceeds were never remitted to Oaña Credit. Nanzan waived her right to present evidence arguing that the real estate mortgage should negate her criminal liability.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 318, RPC (Other Deceits):** Penalizes fraud or damage caused by deceit not mentioned in Articles 315-317 of the RPC. The elements are: (1) false pretense, (2) made prior to or simultaneously with the fraud, and (3) resulting in damage or prejudice.
*   **Loan Agreement:**  Established the terms of the bridge financing loan, specifically linking repayment to the PS Bank loan proceeds, which created an express obligation to remit those funds.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of "other deceits" under Article 318, RPC. Penalty is *arresto mayor* (2 months and 1 day to 4 months) in its medium period and a fine equal to the amount of the damage: PHP 2,565,325.00. Subsidiary imprisonment if the fine is not paid.
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay Oaña Credit Solutions, Inc. actual damages of PHP 2,565,325.00 plus compensatory interest at 6% per annum from the date of extrajudicial demand (September 24, 2013) until full payment. This is separate from the criminal fine.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Excessive Penalty:** The Court noted the potential harshness of imposing both imprisonment and a fine equal to the damages, effectively requiring Nanzan to pay twice. The Court recommended executive clemency to remove the fine.
*   **Unproven Claim of Reliance:** Court notes the importance of the burden of evidence and how Nanzan waived her right to show that the lender was induced by the R.E. Mortgage not the pre-approved loan.
*   **Enforcement of Civil Liabilities**: While the amount of Civil Indemnity is set, in the event Nanzan's assets do not fully cover this amount and the fine, the Decision specifies that "the payment of the fine and civil indemnity imposed in this Decision shall follow the order of preference under Article 38 of the Revised Penal Code."

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Articles 318, 315(2)(a), 39, 5, 36, 23, 38, 100, 104, 112**
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 120, Section 4 (Variance Rule):** Allows conviction for an offense necessarily included in the charged offense, even if not explicitly charged (Art. 318 as included in Art. 315(2)(a)).
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence, Rule 132, Section 34**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45**
*   **Osorio v. People, 834 Phil. 768 (2018):** Confirms Art. 318 is necessarily included in a charge of Art. 315.
*   **Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. v. Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc., G.R. No. 225433, September 20, 2022**
*   **Corpuz v. People, 734 Phil. 353 (2014)**

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The strict interpretation of Article 318, RPC, leading to what the court considers an excessive penalty (imprisonment *and* a fine equal to the damages).  The court acknowledged the potential for overcompensation and recommended executive clemency to mitigate the fine, indicating a concern with the justness of the mandated penalty in this specific context.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision hinges on Nanzan's misrepresentation and failure to present evidence supporting her claim of reliance on the real estate mortgage. It's a relatively straightforward application of Art. 318 but raises concerns about the proportionality of the penalty.
