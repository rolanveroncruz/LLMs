## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Magno*, G.R. No. 126049 (1998)

**Case Summary:**

This is an appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Accused-Appellant Ramon Magno of violating Section 4, Article II of R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended by B.P. Blg. 179, for selling marijuana. The Supreme Court (SC) *affirms* the conviction but *modifies* the penalty based on evidentiary issues regarding the quantity of drugs involved and applying the amended penalties under R.A. 7659.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Illegal sale of marijuana (22 sticks) under R.A. 6425, as amended.
*   **Evidence:** Buy-bust operation; marked money; testimony of poseur-buyer (SPO1 Agdalipe) and back-up officer (SP03 Arboleda); one stick of marijuana submitted for forensic examination; testimony of arresting officers; denial by accused.
*   **RTC Decision:** Conviction and sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of P20,000.00.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Initially found liable for illegal sale of 22 marijuana sticks. SC modified it to the sale of *one* marijuana stick, due to lack of forensic evidence for the remaining 21.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Insufficient Evidence:** The central contentious issue is the lack of forensic examination for all 22 marijuana sticks. The RTC erroneously held that testing one stick was sufficient.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** SC emphasized the crucial need to establish the identity of the marijuana (corpus delicti) with certainty and conclusiveness. The testimony of a non-expert police officer (SP03 Arellano) that all 22 sticks were marijuana was deemed incompetent and inadmissible.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies in Testimony:** The defense raised minor inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers to challenge their credibility. The SC correctly ruled that these inconsistencies did not impact the essential elements of the offense.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), Section 4, Article II:** Original law violated.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 179:** Amended R.A. 6425.
*   **R.A. 7659:** Amended penalties under R.A. 6425 and applied retroactively in this case due to being favorable to the accused. Section 4 and 20 relevant.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied by SC to determine the appropriate sentence.
*   **People vs. Simon, G.R. No. 93028:** Cited for the principle that the commission of the offense of illegal sale of prohibited drugs requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction.
*   **People vs. Pacleb, G.R. No. 90602 & People vs. Flores, G.R. No. 80914:** Cited for the principle that the identity of the marijuana, which constitutes the corpus delicti, must be established with certainty and conclusiveness.
*   **People vs. Enrique, Jr., G.R. No. 90738:** Cited for the need for sufficient knowledge for the identification of the marijuana.

**Outcome:**

The SC **affirms** the conviction of Ramon Magno but **modifies** the penalty. The accused is found guilty of selling *one* stick of marijuana and sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of six (6) months of *arresto mayor* in its maximum period, as the minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional* in its medium period, as the maximum. Because he had been detained since July 29, 1993, beyond the maximum range of his indeterminate sentence, his immediate release from custody was ordered.

**Potential Arguments for Future Cases:**

*   This case underscores the critical importance of proper chain of custody and forensic analysis of seized drugs, *especially* when dealing with multiple items. Failure to test each item individually may lead to reduced charges or acquittal.
*   The decision highlights the weight given to the testimonies of law enforcement officers and their presumption of regularity.
*   The case serves as precedent for the retroactive application of R.A. 7659 if favorable to the accused.
