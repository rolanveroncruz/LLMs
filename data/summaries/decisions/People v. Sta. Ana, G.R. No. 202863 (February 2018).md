## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sta. Ana* (G.R. No. 202863)

**Case Overview:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Isidro Ragasa Sta. Ana for Rape under Articles 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. The accused was found guilty of raping a 13-year-old victim through force and intimidation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 266-A, RPC (as amended by RA 8353):** Defines rape and elements of crime. Key element is carnal knowledge through force, threat, or intimidation, or under circumstances specified (e.g., victim deprived of reason, unconscious, or under 12).
*   **Art. 266-B, RPC (as amended by RA 8353):** Prescribes the penalty for rape, which is reclusion perpetua. The penalty increases to *reclusion perpetua* to death when a deadly weapon is used, or when the crime is committed by two or more persons.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines.
*   **Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code:** When there are neither mitigating nor aggravating circumstances in the commission of the deed, the lesser penalty shall be applied.
*   **R.A. No. 8353 [27]** Entitled "An Act Expanding the Definition of the Crime of Rape, Reclassifying the same as a Crime Against Persons, Amending for the Purpose Act Np. 3815, as Amended, otherwise known as the Revised Penal Code, and for Other Purposes" and dated 30 September 1997.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-Appellant: To serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*, to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Conviction of Rape under Art. 266-A and 266-B of the RPC.
*   Civil Liability: Payment of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages to the victim. 6% interest p.a. on all monetary awards from finality of the decision.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Victim's Age:**  The Information alleged the victim was a minor (13 years old). While the Birth Certificate was attached to the records, it was not formally presented during trial. This raises a potential risk that a stronger penalty might have been imposed if minority was proven. *R.A. 8353 Art. 266 A(1)(d)* states that even if no threat was involved if the offended party is under twelve years of age that will count as rape.
*   **Number of Rape Incidents:** The victim claimed to have been raped multiple times. However, the prosecution only charged the accused with a single count of rape. While this doesn't affect the current conviction, it raises concerns about whether the victim received full justice.

**Summary of Findings:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape. They upheld the lower courts' assessment of witness credibility, particularly the victim's testimony, and found the accused's alibi weak and uncorroborated. The Court also highlighted the prosecution's failure to present the victim's birth certificate and the potential impact of that failure in future cases. The Court emphasizes that for a charge of rape under Article 266-A(1) to prosper, it must be proven that: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman, and (2) he accomplished such act through force or intimidation, or when she was deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or when she was under 12 years of age or was demented.
