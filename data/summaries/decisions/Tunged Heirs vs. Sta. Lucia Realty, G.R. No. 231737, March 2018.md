**Case:** Heirs of Tunged vs. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc. and Baguio Properties, Inc. G.R. No. 231737, March 06, 2018 (827 Phil. 231; 114 OG No. 49, 8191 (December 3, 2018))

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over ancestral land rights and alleged environmental violations. The Heirs of Tunged (Petitioners), claiming to be Indigenous People (IP) of the Ibaloi tribe, filed a complaint against Sta. Lucia Realty and Baguio Properties, Inc. (Respondents) for violations of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA, RA 8371), Presidential Decree (PD) 1586, and the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) issued to the Respondents. The Petitioners alleged that Respondents' earthmoving activities on their ancestral land destroyed resources and posed environmental risks. The RTC dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, stating that the NCIP has exclusive jurisdiction over IP rights recognition. The Supreme Court reversed the RTC's decision, finding that the RTC had jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Petitioners' Claims:** Claimed ancestral land ownership by virtue of native title and IPRA; Respondents' earthmoving activities violated IPRA, PD 1586, and ECC. Petitioners sought: (1) an Environmental Protection Order (EPO); (2) recognition of their rights as IPs to their ancestral land; and (3) restoration of the damaged areas and compensation.

*   **Respondents' Defense:** Claimed ownership over the subject land and argued that the petitioners' complaint is a collateral attack to its Torrens Titles.

*   **RTC Ruling:** Dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, stating that the recognition of IP rights falls under the NCIP's exclusive jurisdiction.

*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the RTC decision.

**Key Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The primary issue is whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC), sitting as a special environmental court, or the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) has jurisdiction over the dispute. The Supreme Court held that the RTC has jurisdiction because the dispute involves alleged violations of environmental laws (PD 1586) and the IPRA, and the Respondents are not members of the same ICC/IP as the Petitioners ( Unduran, et al. v. Aberasturi, et al., 771 Phil. 536 (2015))
*   **NCIP Jurisdiction (Section 66, IPRA):**  The Supreme Court clarified that the NCIP's jurisdiction is limited to disputes *between* members of the same ICC/IP involving rights of ICCs/IPs; non-ICCs/IPs cannot be subjected to the special and limited jurisdiction of the NCIP even if the dispute involves rights of ICCs/IPs since the NCIP has no power and authority to decide on a controversy involving rights of non-ICCs/IPs which should be brought before the courts of general jurisdiction within the legal bounds of rights and remedies ( Engr. Lim, et al. v. Hon. Gamosa, et al., 774 Phil. 31, 61-62 (2015))
*   **Nature of Action:**  The Court emphasized that the nature of the action is determined by the allegations in the complaint.  The Supreme Court found that the case at bar is not an action for the claim of ownership, much less, an application for the issuance of CALTs/CADTs
*   **Legal Standing:** The RTC erred in finding the petitioners lacked legal standing. The NCIP report ( Rollo, pp. 53-60) (although not a final determination of title) presented by Petitioners provided sufficient basis to establish their *locus standi* to bring the action.
*   **Environmental Case:**  The action also involves alleged violations of environmental laws (PD 1586) and the ECC, falling under the jurisdiction of the RTC designated as a special environmental court (AO No. 23-2008 in relation to BP 129 and A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC).
*   **Referral, not Dismissal:** Even if the action were deemed not an environmental case, the proper course would have been referral to the executive judge for re-raffle to a regular court (Section 3, Rule 2 of A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC), not outright dismissal.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents:** Potential liability for environmental violations under PD 1586 and the ECC, as well as potential liability under the IPRA if the petitioners' ancestral land rights are ultimately proven and violated. Obligation to comply with environmental laws and the terms of any ECC issued to them.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Protracted Litigation:** The case will now proceed to trial at the RTC level, potentially involving lengthy proceedings and appeals.
*   **Proof of Ancestral Land Rights:**  The petitioners bear the burden of proving their ancestral land rights under the IPRA, which may be a complex and challenging task.
*   **Conflicting Property Rights:** Respondents claim ownership based on Torrens titles, creating a potential conflict with the Petitioners' claim of ancestral land rights.  The validity and priority of these competing claims will need to be adjudicated.
*   **Environmental Remediation:**  If environmental violations are proven, Respondents may be required to undertake costly remediation measures.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA, RA 8371), Section 66
*   Presidential Decree (PD) 1586
*   Administrative Order (AO) No. 23-2008

*   The interpretation of the ECC and whether the Respondents' activities violated its terms.
*   The validity and effect of Respondents' Torrens titles in relation to Petitioners' claim of ancestral land rights.
