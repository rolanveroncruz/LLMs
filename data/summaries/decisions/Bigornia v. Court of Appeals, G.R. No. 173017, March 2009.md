## Legal Document Summary: Bigornia v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 173017

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the petitioners' appeal due to late filing of their Appellant's Brief.

**Facts:**
*   Private respondent Melchor Aroma filed a case of replevin with damages against petitioners in the RTC.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Aroma, ordering petitioners to pay damages.
*   Petitioners appealed to the CA but filed their Appellant's Brief 14 days late.
*   CA dismissed the appeal pursuant to Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **Section 1(e), Rule 50, Rules of Court:** Allows the CA to dismiss an appeal for failure to file the Appellant's Brief within the prescribed time.
*   **Obligation to File Appellant's Brief on Time:** Petitioners were obligated to file their Appellant's Brief within 45 days from notice.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** The RTC decision held the petitioners jointly and severally liable for significant damages (P350,000 actual/compensatory, P100,000 moral/exemplary, P20,000 attorney's fees).  Dismissal of the appeal would solidify this liability.
*   **Risk of Enforcement:** If the CA decision stands, Aroma could pursue enforcement of the RTC judgment against the petitioners, potentially leading to asset seizure or wage garnishment.

**Reasoning & Holding:**
*   **Discretionary vs. Mandatory Dismissal:** The Supreme Court acknowledged that while Rule 50, Sec. 1(e) allows for dismissal, it is discretionary, not mandatory.
*   **Substantial Justice Argument:** The Court emphasized the importance of substantial justice, citing *United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v. Munsingwear Creation Manufacturing Company* and *Aguam v. Court of Appeals*, and deemed that the relatively substantial damages and the fact that petitioners are public officers with "meager salaries" warranted a hearing on the merits.
*   **Counsel's Excuse:** While not explicitly condoning the late filing, the Court impliedly considered the counsel's explanation of being busy campaigning for political office (though not a strong legal justification) in light of the broader pursuit of justice. The Court cited *Acme Shoe, Rubber & Plastic Corp. v. Court of Appeals* that procedural rules should ensure, not suppress, substantial justice.

**Outcome:**
*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the Petition for Certiorari.
*   The CA Resolutions dismissing the appeal were **SET ASIDE.**
*   The appeal was **REINSTATED** and **REMANDED** to the CA for further proceedings.

**Statutory References:**
*   Rule 50, Section 1(e), Rules of Court

**Case Law References:**
*   United Feature Syndicate, Inc. v. Munsingwear Creation Manufacturing Company, G.R. No. 76193
*   Aguam v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 137672
*   Acme Shoe, Rubber & Plastic Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 103576
*   Tamayo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 147070
*   Sapad v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 132153

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**
*   **Justification for Delay:** While the Court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners, the explanation for the delayed filing (counsel's political campaign) is a weak legal excuse. Reliance on this could set a problematic precedent.
*   **"Meager Salaries" Argument:** The Court's emphasis on the petitioners' salaries as police officers seems potentially prejudicial and not a sound basis for overriding procedural rules. This can raise questions of equality before the law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The CA, upon remand, could still rule against the petitioners on the merits of the replevin/damages case. This case only addressed the procedural issue of the appeal's dismissal.
*   The ruling could be construed as prioritizing sympathetic parties over strict adherence to procedural rules, weakening the application of rules of court.
