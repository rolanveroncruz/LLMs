**Legal Document Summary: Caminos, Jr. v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 147437, May 8, 2009**

**Case Overview:**

This is a petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Larry Caminos, Jr. for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property. The case stems from a vehicular collision between Caminos' Mitsubishi and Arnold Litonjua's Volkswagen at an intersection.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Reckless Imprudence Defined:** The Court reiterates the definition of reckless imprudence under the Revised Penal Code, emphasizing the "inexcusable lack of precaution" as the core element supplying criminal intent.

*   **Proximate Cause:** The Court found Caminos' negligence to be the proximate cause of the accident. His excessive speed and failure to observe due care at the intersection were paramount. (See: _Gabriel v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128474, 6 October 2004, 440 SCRA 136, 148-149_). Also cited Section 35 of RA 4136.

*   **"Right of Way" Clarification:** The Court clarified the "right of way" rule under Section 42 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 4136, stating that right of way is not absolute. And whether one of the drivers has the right of way is a question that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely to occur. The Court emphasizes that Arnold Litonjua's alleged lack of "right of way" does not automatically equate to negligence. The Court cited (Adzuara v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125134, 22 January 1999, 301 SCRA 657).

*   **Contributory Negligence (Rejected Argument):** The Court rejects Caminos' argument that Litonjua's contributory negligence should lead to acquittal, citing that it does not absolve him of criminal liability, at best contributory negligence will only determine the applicability of several other rules governing situations where concurring negligence exists and only for the purpose of arriving at a proper assessment of the award of damages in favor of the private offended party. (State v. Blake, 255 N.W. 108).

*   **Damage Assessment:** The Court affirmed the trial court's award of damages due to the cost of repairs to Litonjua's car, as Caminos failed to rebut the presented evidence of the damage.

**Obligations:**

*   **Motorists' Duty:** The Court reiterates the duty of motorists to exercise reasonable care and caution while driving, commensurate with the conditions encountered on the road, with Section 35 of R.A. No. 4136.
*   This restriction on speed assumes more importance where the motorist is approaching an intersection. Ordinary or reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle at an intersection would naturally require more precaution than is necessary when driving elsewhere in a street or highway (Roberts v. Leahy, 214 P.2d 673).

**Liabilities:**

*   Caminos is held liable for reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property.

*   Required to pay a fine of One Hundred Thirty[-nine] Thousand Two Hundred Ninety[-four (P139,294.00) Pesos which is [the] amount equal to the damage to property resulting from said Reckless Imprudence. On the civil aspect, the accused is hereby ordered to indemnify Antonio Litonjua the similar amount of One Hundred Thirty[-nine] Thousand Two Hundred Ninety[-four] (P139,294.00) Pesos for the damages sustained by his motor vehicle, with costs de officio.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Application of "Last Clear Chance":** Caminos argued that the Court of Appeals misapplied the principle of last clear chance. However, the Court did not explicitly address this issue in detail, suggesting a potential area for further argumentation if similar facts arise.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determining Negligence:** The line between simple negligence and "inexcusable lack of precaution" can be subjective and fact-dependent, making this a potentially contentious area in similar cases.
*   **The extent to which negligence is "incipient"**: The issue of "incipient" negligence on Arnold's part may require deeper analysis in future cases to ascertain the degree to which negligence is present in various road accident scenarios.

**Conclusion:**

The Court upheld the conviction, emphasizing the importance of adhering to traffic laws and exercising reasonable care while driving, particularly at intersections.
