## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bambico, G.R. No. 238617

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a drug case appeal involving violations of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, *acquitting* accused-appellant Alvin Bambico due to a break in the chain of custody rule concerning mandatory witnesses.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody Rule:** Emphasizes the critical importance of establishing the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty as part of the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Witness Requirement (RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):** Inventory and photography of seized drugs must be conducted in the presence of the accused (or their representative/counsel) *and* (1) an elected public official *and* (2) a representative of the National Prosecution Service *OR* the media.  Prior to RA 10640, the requirement was a representative from the media *AND* the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official.
*   **Deviation from Witness Requirement:** The inventory and photography were only witnessed by a Barangay Chairman, with no DOJ or media representative present.
*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution *failed* to provide justifiable reasons for the absence of the DOJ and media representatives and also failed to provide evidence of genuine efforts to secure their presence.  This failure to justify the deviation from the chain of custody rule was fatal to the prosecution's case. The Court specifically noted PO1 Nombre's admission he did not coordinate with the DOJ representative.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a), IRR of RA 9165, adopted by RA 10640):** While non-compliance with the chain of custody is not *ipso facto* fatal if justifiable grounds exist and the integrity of the evidence is preserved, the prosecution bears the burden of proving both elements.  The court emphasizes that justifiable grounds must be *proven as fact*.
*   **Prosecutorial Duty (People v. Miranda):** The State has a positive duty to account for *any* lapses in the chain of custody, even if the defense doesn't raise the issue during trial.
*   **Defense:** Bambico raised a denial defense, which the lower courts found to be self-serving and uncorroborated. However, this became moot due to the prosecution's failure to prove compliance with the chain of custody rule.

**Liabilities:**

*   The primary liability lies with the apprehending officers and prosecution for failing to adhere to the mandatory chain of custody procedures, jeopardizing the case against Bambico.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidence Suppression:** Evidence obtained in violation of the chain of custody rule is inadmissible, leading to acquittal.
*   **Civil Liability:** While not explicitly mentioned, the possibility of a civil action against the officers for wrongful arrest/detention exists if the court finds bad faith or gross negligence in the conduct of the buy-bust operation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 (Sections 5 & 11, Article II)
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to RA 9165 (modifying witness requirements)

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Miranda:** Reinforces the State's burden to account for chain of custody lapses.
*   Cites numerous cases emphasizing the importance of establishing the identity of the dangerous drug as the *corpus delicti* and the mandatory nature of the chain of custody rule (e.g., People v. Crispo, People v. Sanchez, People v. Magsano, People v. Manansala, People v. Mamangon, People v. Viterbo, People v. Gamboa, People v. Umipang, People v. AÃ±o, People v. Mamalumpon, People v. Imson, People v. Ocfemia, People v. Resurreccion, People v. Tumulak, People v. Rollo, People v. Almorfe, People v. De Guzman, People v. Segundo, People v. Macapundag).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in the saving clause is a frequent point of contention. This case highlights the importance of *proving* these grounds, not merely asserting them. The burden rests squarely on the prosecution.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a strong reminder of the necessity for strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases, particularly the mandatory witness requirements.  Failure to adequately justify deviations from this rule can lead to the suppression of evidence and acquittal of the accused, even if evidence suggests guilt. The *People v. Miranda* pronouncement emphasizes that this is a *positive duty* of the prosecution, regardless of whether the defense raises the issue.
