Okay, here's a legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Banco de Oro-EPCI, Inc. v. John Tansipek*, G.R. No. 181235, July 22, 2009 (611 Phil. 90)

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court reversing the Court of Appeals and reinstating the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Banco de Oro-EPCI, Inc. (formerly Equitable PCI Bank, successor-in-interest to PCIB).
*   **Respondent:** John Tansipek (third-party defendant in the RTC).

**Background:**

J.O. Construction, Inc. (JOCI) sued PCIB (now BDO) in the RTC for allowing John Tansipek (JOCI's authorized collector) to deposit a crossed check payable to JOCI into Tansipek's personal account, despite the check being marked "for payee's account only." PCIB filed a third-party complaint against Tansipek, alleging he presented documents suggesting authorization to deposit the check into his account. Tansipek was declared in default in the RTC. The RTC ruled in favor of JOCI against PCIB, and ordered Tansipek to indemnify PCIB. Tansipek appealed only the decision against him to the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Underlying Claim:** JOCI's claim against PCIB is based on the bank's alleged negligence in allowing the deposit of a crossed check into an account other than the payee's. This relates to a bank's duty of care to ensure funds are properly directed when dealing with restrictive endorsements.
*   **Third-Party Complaint:** PCIB sought indemnity from Tansipek based on alleged misrepresentation and/or authorization provided by Tansipek that led PCIB to allow the deposit. The third-party complaint is crucial because PCIB's liability hinges on whether Tansipek had actual or apparent authority to deposit the check.
*   **Default Order:** The critical issue is the validity of the RTC's default order against Tansipek. Tansipek failed to file an answer to PCIB's third-party complaint and was declared in default. The CA reversed the RTC's decision related to the third-party complaint due to the perceived invalidity of the default order against Tansipek.
*   **Doctrine of the Law of the Case:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, holding that the CA's previous dismissal of Tansipek's Petition for Certiorari (challenging the denial of his motion for reconsideration of the default order) constitutes the "law of the case."  The SC ruled that the CA should not have revisited the issue of the default order in Tansipek's appeal from the RTC's final judgment.
*   **Procedural Errors in Challenging Default:** The SC highlighted that Tansipek should have filed a verified "Motion to Lift Order of Default" demonstrating fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable neglect *and* a meritorious defense, rather than just a Motion for Reconsideration.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Rule 9, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court:** Defines the requirements for a motion to set aside a default order.
*   **People v. Pinuila, 103 Phil. 992, 999 (1958):**  SC case defining and applying the Doctrine of the Law of the Case.
*   **Buenviaje v. Court of Appeals, 440 Phil. 84 (2002):** Application of the Doctrine of the Law of the Case in the context of a Petition for Certiorari.
*   **Lina v. Court of Appeals, 220 Phil. 311, 317 (1985); Cerezo v. Tuazon, 469 Phil. 1020, 1036-1037 (2004):**  Established that a party declared in default is not barred from appealing the judgment on the main case, but the appeal must be based on the merits of the evidence presented, not the validity of the default order.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PCIB/BDO's Liability to JOCI:** BDO is liable to JOCI for allowing the improper deposit of the crossed check. The exact legal basis could be negligence, breach of contract (implied duty to the depositor), or conversion.
*   **Tansipek's Liability to PCIB/BDO:** Tansipek is liable to indemnify BDO for the amount BDO has to pay to JOCI. This is based on the RTC's decision, now reinstated by the SC. This liability is significantly impacted by the default order, limiting Tansipek's ability to present defenses.
*   **Risk for Tansipek:** Tansipek's biggest risk is the judgment against him in the third-party complaint, which was entered without him having the opportunity to present a defense. He is bound by the indemnity obligation. The SC's decision severely limits his options for challenging this liability.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The crucial question of whether Tansipek had the authority to deposit the check is not fully litigated due to the default. The "board resolution" and Articles of Incorporation presented by PCIB/BDO are central to this issue, but their validity and applicability are difficult to assess on the current record given that Tansipek was defaulted.
*   The issue of laches was raised, indicating the bank tried to establish that JOCI delayed their claim, implying acceptance of the irregular banking practices.

**Concise Summary:**

The SC reversed the CA and reinstated the RTC ruling, holding Tansipek liable to indemnify BDO (formerly PCIB) for damages BDO owes JOCI.  The core of the SC's ruling is the application of the Doctrine of the Law of the Case, preventing Tansipek from relitigating the validity of the default order against him. Key statutory reference is Rule 9, Section 3(b) of the Rules of Court, detailing requirements for relief from default. The decision raises issues regarding the extent of Tansipek's actual authority and the bank's duty of care regarding crossed checks.  Tansipek bears significant risk due to the binding default judgment.
