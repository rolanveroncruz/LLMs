**Case Summary: OCA v. Inmenzo, A.M. No. P-16-3617 (June 06, 2018)**

**Nature:** Administrative matter concerning misconduct of a Clerk of Court III.

**Facts:** Gilbert T. Inmenzo, Clerk of Court III, MTC Caloocan, was found responsible for the loss of a firearm (evidence in a criminal case) which was in his *custodia legis*. Inmenzo acknowledged receiving the firearm via a signed receipt. He later claimed he signed the receipt inadvertently due to workload, which was refuted by recanted testimonies of co-employees. He resigned during the investigation.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court found Inmenzo GUILTY of SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Safekeeping of Court Records (Manual for Clerks of Court; Rule 136, Sec. 7, Rules of Court):** Clerks of Court have a primary duty to safely keep all records, papers, files, exhibits, and public property committed to their charge.  This is a critical obligation derived from their role as custodians of evidence.
*   **Diligence in Duty (Canon IV, Sec. 1, Code of Conduct for Court Personnel):** Court personnel must perform official duties properly and diligently at all times.
*   **Accountability for Lost Evidence:**  Failure to account for evidence under their custody constitutes neglect.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Simple Neglect of Duty, categorized as a less grave offense under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Rule 10, Section 46 D (1)).
*   **Penalty:** A fine of P20,000, to be deducted from separation benefits.  Originally a suspension was recommended, but a fine was imposed due to his resignation.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Recanted Affidavits:** The initial defense relied on affidavits from co-employees which they later recanted. This raises concerns about potential coercion or undue influence.
*   **Sufficiency of Due Process:** While a formal investigation was conducted, Inmenzo may argue insufficient due process given the changed testimonies.
*   **Assessment of Penalty:** Inmenzo's defense of heavy workload and dilapidated facilities, although rejected, might be revisited in a motion for reconsideration, arguing mitigating circumstances and disparity with penalties in similar cases. The Court relied on his previous administrative offense (violation of Circular No. 62-97) to increase the penalty.
*   **Deduction from Separation Benefits:** Inmenzo might contest the deduction from separation benefits, particularly if he believes he was unjustly penalized or the penalty is disproportionate.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Tandinco, Jr., 773 Phil. 141 (2015):**  Affirms the Clerk of Court's duty to safekeep court records.
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Ramirez, 489 Phil. 262 (2005):**  Discusses liability for neglect leading to loss of evidence due to dilapidated facilities.
*   **Bongalos v. Monungolh, 416 Phil. 695 (2001):**  Illustrates gross neglect for entrusting evidence to another party, leading to its loss.
*   **Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule 10, Section 46 D (1):** Classifies simple neglect of duty as a less grave offense.
*   **Rule 136, Section 7, Rules of Court:** Duty to safekeep all records, papers, files, exhibits and public property.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Areas:**

*   **Causation:**  While Inmenzo's negligence is established, the precise causal link between his negligence and the *actual* loss of the firearm might be argued.
*   **Proportionality of Penalty:** Given the nature of "simple neglect," Inmenzo might argue the P20,000 fine is excessive, particularly if he had significant years of otherwise unblemished service.  This is strengthened if the "dilapidated" condition of the evidence storage contributed.
