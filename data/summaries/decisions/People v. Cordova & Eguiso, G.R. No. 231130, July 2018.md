## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cordova & Eguiso*, G.R. No. 231130

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Cordova for illegal sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165) and illegal possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165) of *shabu*, and of Eguiso for illegal possession (Sec. 11, RA 9165). The Supreme Court *reverses* the conviction and acquits both accused.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Cordova: Illegal sale and possession of *shabu*. Eguiso: Illegal possession of *shabu*. Based on a buy-bust operation.
*   **Prosecution's Argument:** Buy-bust operation led to the sale and subsequent discovery of *shabu* on Cordova and Eguiso.
*   **Defense's Argument:** Denial and frame-up. Claimed police planted evidence.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of all charges based on prosecution's evidence.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC decision, finding unbroken chain of custody.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed, acquitting both accused.

**Obligations Violated & Liabilities:**

*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, which is essential to establish the corpus delicti and secure a conviction.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21, RA 9165:** The Supreme Court heavily relied on the numerous violations of Section 21 of RA 9165.
    *   **Lack of Required Witnesses:** Absence of DOJ and media representatives during inventory and photography was not justified.  The "oversight" in failing to photograph Eguiso at all was deemed insufficient justification.
    *   **Delay in Delivery:** Three-day delay in delivering seized items to the crime lab (April 8 to April 11) was not adequately explained, especially given the policy to promptly notify lab personnel about Friday apprehensions, as noted in Justice Peralta's Concurring Opinion. The court considered whether such deviation exposes the items to a higher probability of being handled and altered.
*   **Compromised Integrity of Evidence:** The multiple procedural breaches raised serious doubts about the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, leading to acquittal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The core statute under which the accused were charged. Section 5 (Illegal Sale), Section 11 (Illegal Possession), and Section 21 (Chain of Custody) are central to the legal analysis.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165):**  While not directly applicable (as the case occurred before its enactment), the Court indirectly addressed the difficulties in strict compliance as noted by the legislative history of the amended law, Justice Peralta's Concurring Opinion, and previous case law that was cited.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of media/DOJ representatives to prevent evidence planting.
*   **People v. Abetong, 735 Phil. 476 (2014):** Acquitted due to unexplained delay in drug delivery, highlighting the increased risk of tampering.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671 (2018):** Stresses the prosecutor's duty to prove compliance with Section 21, even if the issue isn't raised below, and to justify any deviations. Justice Peralta cited *People v. Teng Moner y Adam*, (G.R. No. 202206, March 5, 2018)
*   **Chain of Custody Jurisprudence:** The court cites numerous cases emphasizing the importance of establishing a clear and unbroken chain of custody, ensuring proper handling and preservation of the seized drugs.
*   **Art. 125, Revised Penal Code, Delay in delivery of detained persons to the proper judicial authorities (cited in Justice Peralta's Concurring Opinion)**

**Legal Analysis and Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court prioritized strict adherence to the chain of custody rule, as outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165. The prosecution's failure to adequately justify deviations from this rule, particularly regarding the absence of required witnesses and the unexplained delay in delivering the seized items to the crime laboratory, led to a reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the evidence. Therefore, the accused were acquitted.
