## Legal Document Summary: *De Vera v. De Vera*, G.R. No. 172832

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmance of the RTC's decision in a bigamy case.

**Facts:**

*   Geren de Vera (Respondent) was charged with Bigamy for marrying Josephine Juliano while still married to Rosario de Vera (Petitioner).
*   Respondent initially pleaded "Guilty" but later moved to withdraw the plea to present the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.
*   RTC granted the motion and considered both plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, sentencing Respondent to 6 months *arresto mayor* to 4 years, 2 months *prision correccional*.
*   Petitioner sought partial reconsideration, arguing against the application of voluntary surrender, but was denied.
*   Petitioner then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the CA, which was also denied.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstance of Voluntary Surrender:** The primary issue is whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's appreciation of voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance under Article 349 in relation to paragraph 5, Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Propriety of Petitioner's Action:** The Supreme Court questioned the procedural propriety of Petitioner's motion for reconsideration and petition for certiorari seeking a harsher penalty.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Supreme Court raised concerns about violating Respondent's right against double jeopardy.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent:** Convicted of Bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **RTC:** Had the obligation to correctly apply the law regarding mitigating circumstances and modification of judgments.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** Modifying the judgment to increase the penalty could violate Respondent's right against double jeopardy. *People v. Court of Appeals*, 405 Phil. 247 (2001).
*   **Procedural Impropriety:** The Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was filed by the private complainant, rather than the accused, violating Section 7, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court cited *People v. Viernes*, 423 Phil. 463 (2001), which highlights the rule that only the accused can move to modify a judgement of conviction, to avoid the potential of the prosecution to seek a harsher penalty after a ruling.
*   **Certiorari Review Limitations:** Certiorari is only proper where there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. *People v. Veneracion*, 319 Phil. 364 (1995).

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 349 (Bigamy):** Defines the crime and penalty.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 64 (Rules for application of penalties):** Refers to mitigating and aggravating circumstances.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 120, Section 7 (Modification of judgment):** Governs the modification of judgments of conviction.
*   *People v. Cagas*, G.R. No. 145504, June 30, 2004, 433 SCRA 290: Discusses the requisites of voluntary surrender.

*   *People v. Oco*, 458 Phil. 815 (2003): Illustrates that a warrant alone is not enough to make a surrender involuntary.
*    *People v. Astudillo, 449 Phil. 778 (2003)* Indicates that the accused must be the one to move for modification of the judgment
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applicable in determining the penalty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Voluntary Surrender Requisites:** While the basic requisites (not arrested, surrender to authority, voluntary) are clear, the application of these, especially considering a pending warrant of arrest, remains fact-dependent and open to interpretation. The existence and validity of the warrant at the precise moment of surrender and the accused's knowledge is critical. The degree of *imminence* of arrest given the existence of a warrant is key.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately *denied* the petition, upholding the CA decision. The Court emphasized that the RTC did not gravely abuse its discretion in appreciating voluntary surrender and that the Petitioner's attempt to increase the penalty through a motion for reconsideration was procedurally improper and could potentially violate Respondent's right against double jeopardy. The Court found the voluntary surrender to be adequately proven given the respondent surrendered himself to the court immediately after finding out he was being charged, but before a warrant for his arrest could be served. The decision reinforces the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in criminal cases and highlights the limitations on the prosecution's ability to modify judgments of conviction.
