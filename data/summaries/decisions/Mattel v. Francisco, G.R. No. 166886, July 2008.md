Here's a legal summary of *Mattel, Inc. v. Emma Francisco*, G.R. No. 166886, July 30, 2008:

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed Mattel's Petition for Review on Certiorari, finding the case moot and academic. The dispute involved Mattel's opposition to Jimmy Uy's trademark application for "BARBIE" on confectionery products, claiming confusing similarity to Mattel's "BARBIE" trademark on dolls and related items. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Intellectual Property Office (IPO)'s decision allowing Uy's registration.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Trademark Dispute:** Mattel opposed Uy's trademark application based on Section 123.1(d) of R.A. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code), arguing likely confusion. Key issue was whether "dolls, doll clothes, etc." were related goods to "confectionery products."
*   **Declaration of Actual Use (DAU):** Crucially, Uy admitted to *not* filing the mandatory DAU under Section 124.2 of R.A. 8293 and Rule 204 of the Rules and Regulations on Trademarks and Memorandum Circular No. BT 2K1-3-04. Failure to file the DAU within 3 years of filing date should result in deemed abandonment of the trademark application.
*   **Mootness:** The SC held that Uy's admission of non-compliance with the DAU requirement rendered the case moot, as he had effectively abandoned his trademark application. No actual controversy remained.
*   **Newly Discovered Evidence:** Mattel attempted to introduce its own trademark application for "BARBIE" on confectionery. This argument was rendered irrelevant due to the Mootness.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Uy:** Obligation to file DAU under R.A. 8293 and implementing regulations. Failure resulted in abandonment.
*   **Mattel:** Burden to prove likelihood of confusion under trademark law. This was not reached as the issue of abandonment by Uy took precedence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Related Goods:** The initial contention revolved around whether dolls and confectionery products were "related goods" under trademark law, a fact-intensive inquiry with legal consequences regarding likelihood of confusion (citing Section 123.1(d) of R.A. 8293). Had the case not been moot, this would have been the central legal battle.
*   **Retroactive Application of R.A. 8293:** The transition from the old BPTTT rules to the new IPO rules under R.A. 8293 could have presented issues regarding the applicability of the DAU requirement to applications filed before the law's enactment, but the relevant regulations clarify this issue.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code):** Primarily Sections 123.1(d) and 124.2 regarding likelihood of confusion and DAU requirements, respectively.
*   **Rules and Regulations on Trademarks (Rule 204):** Details the DAU requirement.
*   **Memorandum Circular No. BT 2K1-3-04:** Further clarifies DAU requirements for applications pending under R.A. 166 (the prior trademark law).
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 26:** Regarding admissions against interest.
*   **Jurisprudence:** Cited cases define the limits of judicial review (actual cases and controversies) and exceptions to the mootness doctrine (e.g., grave constitutional violations, public interest, capable of repetition yet evading review as seen in *Constantino v. Sandiganbayan*, *Public Interest Center, Inc. v. Elma*, *David v. Arroyo*, and similar cases cited).

**Legal Significance**

The case reinforces the principle of mootness and the importance of adhering to statutory requirements, particularly the DAU provision in trademark law. It illustrates that a party's admission against interest can be decisive in resolving a legal dispute, even if broader issues of trademark similarity remain unaddressed.
