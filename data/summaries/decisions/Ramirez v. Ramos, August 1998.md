**Case:** *Aniceta Ramirez, et al. vs. Court of Appeals and Spouses Benedicto and Evangeline Ramos* (G.R. No. 96412, August 24, 1998)

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership of a parcel of land stemming from two deeds of sale and a claim of equitable mortgage.

**Key Provisions and Timeline:**

1.  **First Deed of Sale (Dec 18, 1965):** Spouses Agustin and Aniceta Ramirez sold land to Maria vda. de Ramos for P28,000. Maria took possession, but title was not transferred.
2.  **Death of Maria vda. de Ramos (Apr 7, 1974):** Benedicto Ramos (son) inherited the land.
3.  **Second Deed of Sale (Mar 25, 1977):** Benedicto Ramos sold the land to Vicente Aniñon for P20,000 in a document titled "Settlement and Extrajudicial Adjudication of the Estate of Maria vda. de Ramos by a Sole Heir with Simultaneous Sale of Inheritance".
4.  **Death of Agustin Ramirez (Dec 29, 1982):** His heirs (including Aniceta) adjudicated the land to themselves.
5.  **Third Deed of Sale (Dec 20, 1984):** Heirs of Agustin Ramirez sold the same property to Spouses Aniñon for P95,000. Aniñons then conveyed the property to the spouses, Elmer Sunbanum and Beng Tee Sunbanum.
6.  **Quieting of Title Suit (May 14, 1985):** Spouses Benedicto and Evangeline Ramos sued to quiet title, annul the third sale, and cancel TCTs. They argued the second sale to Aniñon was an equitable mortgage.

**Court of Appeals Decision:** Reversed the trial court. Declared the second sale (Ramos to Aniñon) to be an equitable mortgage; declared the third sale (Heirs to Aniñon) null and void; ordered cancellation of titles derived from third sale, and restoration of original title in the name of Benedicto Ramos.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** *Affirmed* the Court of Appeals.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Ramos:** Obligated to pay Aniñon the principal amount of P20,000 (loan) with legal interest from the date of the CA judgment.
*   **Aniñon:** Obligated to reconvey the property to Ramos upon payment of the debt.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Heirs of Ramirez:** Liable for selling property they no longer owned. The sale to the Aniñons was deemed void.
*   **Aniñon:**  Faces the risk of losing the property upon Ramos' payment of the debt. Aniñon also faces potential liability for damages to Sunbanum.

**Statutory References and Case Law:**

*   **Article 1602, New Civil Code:** Used to determine that the second sale (Ramos to Aniñon) was actually an equitable mortgage due to inadequate price and continued possession by the vendor.
*   **Article 1191, New Civil Code:** Reference to rescission as a remedy for non-payment, used to argue that the failure of the Ramirezes to rescind the first sale suggested the full purchase price was paid.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Bautista v. Sioson, 39 Phil. 615; Lichauco v. Berenguer, 39 Phil. 643; Cruz v. Cabana, 129 SCRA 656* - cited for the principle that the third sale from Ramirez heirs was invalid because they no longer owned the property.
    *   *Republic vs. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 721, 722; Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 313* - cited to say that Supreme Court doesn't review facts made by Court of Appeals.
    *   *Olea vs. Court of Appeals, 247 SCRA 274; Lazatin vs. Court of Appeals, 211 SCRA 129; Capulong vs. Court of Appeals, 130 SCRA 245* - cited for the doctrine that where vendor remains in possession, contract should be treated as an equitable mortgage.
    *   *Camus vs. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 612; Capulong vs. Court of Appeals, 130 SCRA 245* - cited to say that the real intention of the parties is determinative of the true nature of the transaction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Consideration of the First Sale:** The issue of whether the full purchase price was paid in the first sale was highly contested. The petitioners' claim of non-payment and alleged refund were rejected due to lack of evidence.
*   **Nature of the Second Sale:** Crucial point of contention was whether the sale from Benedicto Ramos to Vicente Aniñon was an absolute sale or an equitable mortgage.

**Key Arguments and Findings:**

*   **Petitioners (Ramirez heirs, Aniñon, Sunbanum):** Argued the first sale was flawed due to non-payment of the full purchase price, and that the second sale was an absolute sale, giving Aniñon valid title.
*   **Respondents (Ramos Spouses):** Maintained that the first sale was valid; that the second sale was an equitable mortgage; and that the Ramirez heirs had no right to sell the property a second time.
*   **Supreme Court:** Found that the first sale was valid. The Court of Appeals correctly determined the second sale to be an equitable mortgage based on inadequate price, continued possession by the vendor (Ramos), and the subsequent purchase by Aniñon from the Ramirez heirs.

This case highlights the importance of thoroughly documenting real estate transactions and ensuring clarity in the intent of the parties. The Court's finding of an equitable mortgage demonstrates its willingness to look beyond the literal terms of a contract to ascertain the true intentions of the parties, particularly when issues of fairness and equity are involved.
