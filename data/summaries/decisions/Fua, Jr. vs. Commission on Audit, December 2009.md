**Summary of *Fua, Jr. v. Commission on Audit***

**Case:** *Fua, Jr. v. Commission on Audit*, G.R. No. 175803, December 4, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 64, questioning the COA's disallowance of extra Christmas bonuses granted by the Province of Siquijor to its employees.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Bonus Grant:** The Sangguniang Panlalawigan authorized and appropriated funds (P8,600,000.00) for an extra Christmas bonus of P20,000.00 per employee.
*   **Presidential "No Objection":** Governor Fua requested presidential authority for the bonus. The President wrote "No Objection" on the letter.
*   **COA Disallowance:** The Audit Team Leader issued AOMs questioning the bonus's legality, citing Budget Circular No. 2003-7 (limiting extra bonuses to P5,000.00) and Section 325(a) of the Local Government Code (55% Personal Services expenditure limit).
*   **Grounds for Disallowance:**
    *   Violation of Budget Circular No. 2002-A (prohibition on unauthorized compensation increases under the Salary Standardization Law (SSL) and R.A. No. 6686). The President's "No Objection" was not considered an approval.
    *   Exceeding the 55% Personal Services expenditure limit under the Local Government Code.
*   **Procedural Issue:** Petitioner appealed the disallowance to the COA-Legal and Adjudication Office-Local (COA-LAO-Local) but then filed a Petition for Certiorari directly to the Supreme Court without appealing to the COA Proper.

**COA Decision:** The COA-LAO-Local affirmed the disallowance.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition due to the failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** The Province of Siquijor was obligated to appeal the COA-LAO-Local's decision to the COA Proper before seeking judicial review. Failure to do so rendered the COA-LAO-Local decision final and executory.
*   **Liability for Disallowed Funds:** Implicitly, the officials responsible for authorizing the illegal disbursement are potentially liable for the P6,345,000.00 disallowed, subject to further COA enforcement actions.
*   **Compliance with Budget Circulars and Local Government Code:** The Province is obligated to comply with budgetary limitations on personal services expenditures as outlined in Section 325(a) of the Local Government Code. They must also adhere to the limits placed on bonuses as set out in the relevant circulars.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Personal Liability:** Individuals responsible for authorizing the illegal disbursement may be held personally liable to return the disallowed funds.
*   **Future Disallowances:** Similar disbursements in the future will likely be disallowed, and the province will be subject to closer scrutiny.
*   **Lack of Presidential Authority:** The Supreme Court did not deem the President's marginal note sufficient approval for the bonus, raising the risk that similar "No Objection" notes might not be considered sufficient for other deviations from standard compensation rules.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 64 & 65:** Used as basis for the petition for certiorari.
*   **Local Government Code, Section 325(a):** 55% limitation on Personal Services expenditure.

*   **The President's Marginal Note:** Whether the President's "No Objection" on the letter-request constituted a valid approval for the extra bonus, especially in light of conflicting budget circulars.
*   **Purely Legal Question:** The petitioner argued the case involved a purely legal question, which could excuse failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The court disagreed.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Compliance:** Ensure strict compliance with all COA regulations and budget circulars regarding compensation and benefits.
*   **Formal Approval:** Obtain formal, written approval from the President for any compensation-related deviations from standard regulations.
*   **Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** Always exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.
*   **Review Budget Allocation:** Review the province's budget allocation to ensure compliance with the personal services cap in the Local Government Code.
