## Legal Document Summary: *P/SUPT. RENE MACALING ORBE v. MARCOS U. DIGANDANG*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-09-2685 [OCA-IPI No. 08-2839-P]

**Court:** Supreme Court (En Banc)

**Date:** September 03, 2009

**Issue:** Whether respondent Marcos U. Digandang, Process Server, is guilty of Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service for illegally releasing detainees charged with a non-bailable offense.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Illegal Release:** Digandang, a process server, released Abdulsalam Indag and Baida Manabilang, accused of violating R.A. 9165 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), from detention based solely on a Custody Receipt he signed.
*   **Non-Bailable Offense:** The accused were charged with a non-bailable offense, making their release improper without a court order or bail.
*   **Respondent's Justification:** Digandang claimed the release was for medical attention for his relatives and asserted he couldn't secure legal services to file a motion for temporary release.
*   **OIC-Provincial Warden's Admission:** Warden Laman P. Malikol admitted to relinquishing custody for "humanitarian reasons."
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Digandang guilty and recommended dismissal.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Rule 114, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Explicitly requires a court order or bail for the release of detainees under legal process.
*   **Duty of a Court Employee:** Digandang, as a court employee, had a duty to uphold the law and court procedures.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Grave Misconduct:** The Court found Digandang guilty of Grave Misconduct, justifying dismissal.
*   **Dismissal:** The penalty imposed was dismissal from service, forfeiture of benefits (except accrued leave credits), and disqualification from re-employment in government service.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Humanitarian Reasons" Argument:** The Court rejected the "humanitarian reasons" defense due to a lack of supporting medical documentation. This highlights the need for concrete evidence when claiming emergency situations to justify deviations from established legal procedures.
*   **Warden's Liability:** While Digandang was dismissed, the Warden was merely referred to the Department of Justice for further action. This indicates a potential secondary liability for the Warden, though the extent of the penalty is undetermined in this document.
*   **PAO Availability:** The Court's assertion that a PAO lawyer would have been available at 3:00 p.m. on a Friday might be a point of contention, depending on the specific circumstances and PAO's workload.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Offense that detained were charge with.
*   **Section 3, Rule 114, Rules of Court:** Key provision requiring a court order or bail for the release of detainees.
*   *Implicit reference to case law regarding grave misconduct:* The Court's decision implicitly relies on existing jurisprudence defining grave misconduct and its consequences.

**Contention Points:**

*   The respondent attempted to offer the defense that the release was for humanitarian reasons, a defense that did not hold up.
*   The Court found the respondent's admission of lacking of access to legal counsel as dubious.
