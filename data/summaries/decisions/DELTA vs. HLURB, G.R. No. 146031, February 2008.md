## Legal Document Summary: *Delta Development & Management Services, Inc. v. The Housing and Land Regulatory Board*

**Case:** G.R. No. 146031, February 19, 2008

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Resolutions dismissing a Petition for Prohibition against HLURB.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Delta Development & Management Services, Inc. (Delta), a real estate developer.
*   **Respondent:** Housing and Land Regulatory Board (HLURB), a government regulatory body for housing and land development.

**Facts:**

*   Delta Homes, developed by Delta, faced multiple complaints filed by lot buyers with the HLURB for violations of PD 957 and BP 220.
*   Delta alleged an HLURB employee, Jun Labapi, prepared the complaints against them, compromising impartiality.
*   Delta filed a Petition for Prohibition with the Court of Appeals to stop HLURB proceedings.
*   The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to implead the complainants.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **HLURB's Regulatory Authority:** The HLURB has quasi-judicial authority to hear and resolve complaints related to real estate development under PD 957 and BP 220.
*   **Developer's Obligations:** Delta has obligations under PD 957 and BP 220 related to developing and selling lots, including delivery of titles free of liens upon full payment.

**HLURB Case No. RIV-071399-1083 Ruling:** The court ordered the complainant to pay balance on selling price of P375,000, ordered Delta to deliver title upon full payment, pay moral damages, exemplary damages, costs of suit, and administrative fine.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability for Delta:** Damages and fines as determined by the HLURB for violating PD 957 and BP 220, as exemplified by the arbiter's decision.
*   **Administrative Fines:** The HLURB can impose administrative fines for non-compliance.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Further HLURB Proceedings:** If complaints are legitimate, Delta faces continued legal battles and potential liabilities.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Multiple complaints could negatively affect Delta's reputation.
*   **Enforcement of HLURB Orders:** HLURB orders can be enforced through judicial proceedings.

**Key Legal Issues and Case Law:**

*   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** The court ruled Delta failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising the issue of HLURB employee bias with the HLURB Arbiter first. *Esquivel v. Ombudsman, 437 Phil. 702, 714-715 (2002)* is cited for the principle that prohibition is inappropriate when other remedies are available.
*   **Due Process:** Delta claimed denial of due process, but the court held that the failure to raise concerns with the Arbiter weakens this argument. Delta needed to use remedies for disqualification of the arbiter.
*   **Prohibition:** The court stated prohibition is an extraordinary remedy and not applicable because the ordinary remedies provided by law are adequate.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957 and Batas Pambansa Blg. 220:** These statutes govern real estate development and provide the basis for the complaints against Delta.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):** Regulates the sale of subdivision lots and condominium units.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 220 (Economic and Socialized Housing Projects):** Addresses the development of economic and socialized housing.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Allegations of HLURB Bias:** The central contention rests on the alleged impropriety of the HLURB employee's actions. Proving this bias would be crucial but Delta failed to do so procedurally.
*   **Adequacy of HLURB Internal Remedies:** The efficacy of internal remedies within the HLURB to address bias is a potential point of contention.

**Advice/Further Actions:**

*   **Procedural Compliance:** Delta must strictly adhere to HLURB rules of procedure, particularly regarding challenging alleged bias.
*   **Potential Settlement:** Attempting to settle with the complainants could mitigate risks and damages.
*   **Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** Make sure you exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.
