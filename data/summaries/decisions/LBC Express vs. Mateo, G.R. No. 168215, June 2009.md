**Case:** LBC Express - Metro Manila, Inc. v. James Mateo, G.R. No. 168215 (2009)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that James Mateo, a regular employee of LBC, was validly dismissed for just cause (gross negligence) and that procedural due process was observed.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Employee Role:** James Mateo was a customer associate responsible for package delivery and pick-up, assigned a company motorcycle.
*   **Incident:** Mateo parked the motorcycle unlocked in front of the LBC office. It was stolen within 3-5 minutes.
*   **Termination:** LBC terminated Mateo's employment for gross negligence.
*   **Legal Issue:** Whether Mateo's dismissal was valid (just cause and due process).

**Obligations:**

*   **Employee (Mateo):** Duty of care to protect company property, specifically the motorcycle, as instructed by LBC.
*   **Employer (LBC):** Obligation to observe substantive and procedural due process in terminating employment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employee (Mateo):** Found liable for gross negligence due to failure to lock the motorcycle, resulting in its loss (book value P46,000).
*   **Employer (LBC):** Initially found liable for illegal dismissal by the CA but exonerated by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Employee (Mateo):** Loss of job, potential for liability for damages to the company.
*   **Employer (LBC):** Potential for illegal dismissal charges if due process is not followed or just cause is lacking.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 282(b) of the Labor Code:** Grounds for termination; specifically, gross and habitual negligence.
*   **Tres Reyes v. Maxim's Tea House:** Defines gross negligence as want of even slight care.
*   **Fuentes v. NLRC:** Addresses the employer's right to terminate employment when the employee's continued tenure is inimical to the employer's interest due to gross negligence.
*   **Amadeo Fishing Corp. v. Nierra:** Regarding the requirements for procedural due process in termination cases, specifically the content of the notice of termination.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** Requirement of two notices: (1) Notice of intent to dismiss stating grounds; (2) Notice of termination after opportunity to be heard.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Habituality Requirement:** While the Labor Code mentions "gross and habitual" negligence, the Court dispensed with the habituality requirement, focusing on the substantial damage caused to the company due to the single act of negligence. This creates potential uncertainty as to when a single act of gross negligence is sufficient for termination.
*   **Sufficiency of First Notice:** The CA found the initial notice of investigation lacking in specificity regarding the grounds for termination. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, finding that the mention of "alleged carnapping" and "alleged pilferage" was sufficient to inform Mateo of the reasons for investigation.  This highlights the importance of clearly articulating the grounds for investigation and potential termination in the initial notice.
*   **Proportionality of Penalty:** One could argue if dismissal was the appropriate penalty, considering the length of service and potential mitigating circumstances. However, the court emphasized the responsibility entrusted to Mateo and the substantial loss incurred by LBC.
