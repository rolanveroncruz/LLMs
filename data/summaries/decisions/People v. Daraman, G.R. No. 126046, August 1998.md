Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Robert Daraman*, G.R. No. 126046 (28 August 1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction of robbery with homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Facts:** Robert Daraman was convicted as a co-principal in a robbery with homicide. The victim, Lina Labrador, was shot and killed during the robbery. Co-accused Edgardo Lumenarias pleaded guilty. The conviction was primarily based on the testimonies of Fausto Labrador (the victim's husband) and Bienvenido Piamonte (an admitted participant who became a witness).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Article 294(1), RPC:** Defines and penalizes robbery with homicide (reclusion perpetua to death).
*   **Indemnification:** Obligation to indemnify the victim's heirs for death, moral damages, exemplary damages, and actual expenses.

**Liabilities:**

*   Robert Daraman was found liable as a co-principal and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   He was ordered to pay P50,000 indemnity for the death of Lina Labrador, P20,000 for moral damages, P10,000 for exemplary damages, and P19,000 for actual burial expenses, plus restitution of the stolen money and articles.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The judge who penned the decision was not the judge who heard most of the witness testimonies, potentially affecting the weight given to credibility assessments. However, the Supreme Court found no reason to differ from the trial court’s conclusions after meticulously reviewing the records.
*   **Witness Immunity/Motivation:** The testimony of Bienvenido Piamonte, an admitted participant, is crucial but potentially compromised due to his possible motive to shift blame to reduce his own liability. The Court acknowledges Piamonte’s testimony came from a “polluted source,” but found it admissible and competent because it corroborated key points of the victim’s husband’s testimony.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Daraman presented an alibi, claiming he was working elsewhere at the time of the crime. However, this was rejected due to the positive identification by Fausto Labrador.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Basis for the charge and penalty.
*   **Doctrine of Single Credible Witness:** Testimony of a single credible witness, particularly if unbiased, is sufficient for conviction. *People v. Nulla*, *People v. Nimo*.
*   **Assessment of Witness Credibility by Trial Judge:** General rule of deference, not applicable as the trial judge didn't observe all witnesses.
*   **Identification by Strangers:** Identification is valid even if the witness didn't previously know the accused. *People v. Bracamonte*.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Dwelling was deemed an aggravating circumstance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The ambiguity lies in the reliance on Piamonte's testimony due to his potential bias and motivation to testify falsely. However, the Court upheld its admissibility due to its corroborative nature with other witness testimonies.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court upheld Daraman's conviction for robbery with homicide, finding the prosecution's evidence, particularly the testimony of Fausto Labrador, sufficient for conviction, despite alibi defense and concerns regarding the credibility of a state witness. The imposed damages were affirmed.
