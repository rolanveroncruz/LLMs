## Legal Document Summary: *Facilities, Inc. v. Lopez* (G.R. Nos. 208642 & 208883)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision concerning probable cause for criminal charges.

**Parties:**
*   **Facilities, Inc. (Facilities):** Owner of condominium units; Complainant.
*   **Ralph Lito W. Lopez:** President and CEO of Primelink Properties and Development Corporation (PPDC); Respondent/Accused.
*   **Primelink Properties and Development Corporation (PPDC):** Developer of Tagaytay Woodsborough Residential Estate.

**Key Provisions & Agreements:**
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):** "Swap arrangement" where Facilities would lease condominium units to PPDC for 4 years, with the first 21 months' rent serving as consideration for PPDC to execute a deed of absolute sale of three lots in favor of Facilities, and deliver TCTs within 360 days.
*   **Contract to Sell:** Corresponds with MOA regarding the sale of the lots.
*   **Contract of Lease:** Corresponds with MOA regarding the lease of the condominium.
*   **Remedial Measure Clause (MOA & Contract to Sell):** Facilities could demand cancellation and receive P2,384,985.60 if PPDC failed to comply.

**Obligations:**
*   **PPDC (Lopez):** Transfer title of lots to Facilities and deliver TCTs within 360 days; Ensure lots are free from encumbrances; Issue certificate of ownership pending TCT issuance.
*   **Facilities:** Allow PPDC to occupy the condominium units and to pay notarial fees, documentary stamps, transfer and registration fees once sales tax is paid by PPDC.

**Breaches & Allegations:**
*   **PPDC (Lopez):** Failed to deliver TCTs, even after Facilities allowed use of condominium units for more than the stipulated 21 months. Title remained in the name of Primo Erni. PPDC vacated leased premises without notice.
*   **Facilities:** Alleged violation of Section 25 and 39 of PD 957 and Estafa under Art 316(1) of the RPC due to Lopez's misrepresentation of PPDC's ownership and failure to deliver titles.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**
*   **Lopez:** Potential criminal liability under Section 25 of PD 957 (failure to deliver title upon full payment) and Article 316(1) of the RPC (Estafa by misrepresenting ownership).
*   **PPDC:** Potential breach of contract liability for failure to deliver TCTs.
*   **Facilities:** Risk of not obtaining title and potentially losing the opportunity cost of leasing the condominium units.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):** Specifically Sections 25 (Issuance of Title) and 39 (Penalties) - Key statutory basis for the criminal charges.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 316(1):** Estafa by misrepresenting ownership of real property.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 112, Sec. 1:** Defines Preliminary Investigation and probable cause.
*   **DOJ Circular 70:** Procedures for review of Prosecutor’s decisions.
*   **Relevant Case Law:** *Villanueva, et al. v. Caparas*, *Atty. Allan S. Hilbero v. Florencio A. Morales, Jr.*, *Morla v. Belmonte, et al.* and *Pan Pacific Service Contractors, Inc., et al. v. Equitable PCI Bank* are cited regarding probable cause determination, contractual obligations, and remedies available.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Full Payment:** Lopez argued Facilities did not pay notarial fees, stamps, etc., but court noted these are only due *after* sales taxes are paid by PPDC. This reveals a disagreement on *when* "full payment" is deemed to occur. The lack of clarity in contract about payment of those fees.
*   **PPDC's Ownership:** While PPDC held a Deed of Absolute Sale from Primo Erni’s heirs, the failure to transfer title raises questions of good faith and control over the property, relevant to the Estafa charge.

**Key Issue:** Whether there is probable cause to indict Lopez for violation of Section 25, P.D. No. 957 and for the crime of estafa under paragraph 1, Article 316 of the RPC.

**Court Ruling (Supreme Court):**
*   **Granted** Facilities’ petition in G.R. No. 208642.
*   **Denied** Lopez’s petition in G.R. No. 208883.
*   **Affirmed** CA decision with **modification**: City Prosecutor to file information against Lopez for Estafa under Art. 316(1) RPC, in addition to the violation of Section 25 of P.D. No. 957 (as affirmed by the CA). The Court found probable cause to warrant charges for both PD 957 violation and Estafa.

**Potential Legal Strategies/Points for Consideration:**
*   **Defense:** Argue that the MOA/Contract to Sell did not clearly establish a firm timeline for PPDC's obligation to transfer the title.
*   **Prosecution:** Focus on the misrepresentation of PPDC's ownership and the lack of diligent effort to transfer title.
*   **Civil Action:** Consider a separate action for specific performance to compel PPDC to transfer the title.
