## Legal Document Summary: PNB vs. Velasco (G.R. No. 166096)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a CA decision that reversed the NLRC and Labor Arbiter, finding illegal dismissal.

**Key Facts:**

*   Ramon Brigido L. Velasco (Respondent), a PNB audit officer, made a US$15,000 withdrawal from his dollar account at an off-line PNB branch without his passbook ("no-book" transaction).
*   The withdrawal wasn't posted by PNB Escolta Branch, resulting in an overstatement of his account.
*   Respondent allegedly knew of the error but did not report it.
*   Respondent later made withdrawals, depleting the overstated balance.
*   Upon discovery, Respondent initially claimed a "no-book" transaction but later changed his story, producing a passbook with a seemingly falsified entry.
*   PNB charged Respondent with dishonesty, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
*   Respondent was placed under preventive suspension and eventually forced to resign with benefits after administrative investigation.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 1216 of the Manual of Regulations for Banks and Other Financial Intermediaries:** Prohibits withdrawals without passbook presentation.
*   **General Circular 3-72/92:** Requires a letter of introduction for out-of-town withdrawals.
*   **PNB Internal Control Procedures:** Demand a Letter of Introduction and passbook to be presented by the depositor before a withdrawal is allowed. This procedure is required in order for the negotiating branch to determine or ascertain the available balance and the specimen signature of the withdrawing party. Moreover, the maintaining branch upon issuance of the LOI shall place a "hold" on the account in the computer as an internal control procedure.
*   **Article 282 of the Labor Code:** Outlines just causes for employee termination, including serious misconduct, fraud, and breach of trust.
*   Employee's obligation of good conduct, diligence, and work.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondent (Velasco):**
    *   **Serious Misconduct:** Violation of bank regulations, making a no-book withdrawal (confirmed by PNB Ligao staff), and changing his sworn statement.
    *   **Breach of Trust:** Failure to report the overstated account balance.
    *   **Dishonesty:** Likely falsification of passbook entry, with the purpose of concealing the "no-book" withdrawal and profiting from the error.
    *   Risk of criminal prosecution for falsification and/or estafa.
*   **PNB:**
    *   Potential for liability for illegal dismissal if the misconduct was not proven serious or work-related. Mitigation: The Supreme Court found that a managerial employee can be terminated for a first offense.
    *   **Procedural Risk:** Initial appeal to the CA was via Rule 43 (Petition for Review) instead of Rule 65 (Certiorari), but the Supreme Court did not consider that it was necessary to dismiss the appeal.
    *   **Potential Exposure:** Unpaid wages during preventive suspension beyond statutory limit.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282 (Just Causes for Termination):** Crucial for determining the legality of the dismissal.
*   **Austria v. NLRC (G.R. No. 124382):** Defines misconduct as "improper and wrongful conduct" implying "wrongful intent".
*   **Philippine Aeolus Automotive United Corporation v. NLRC (G.R. No. 124617):** Sets the standard for serious misconduct: serious, work-related, and rendering employee unfit.
*   **Pure Foods Corporation v. NLRC (G.R. No. 78591, March 21, 1989, 171 SCRA 415.):** Clarifies the availability of certiorari as a recourse when tribunals exceed their jurisdiction.
*   **St. Martin Funeral Homes v. NLRC (G.R. No. 130866):** Establishes certiorari under Rule 65 as the proper mode of appeal from NLRC decisions.
*    **Perez v. People (G.R. No. 164763, February 12, 2008):** Illustrates how conflicting statements affect credibility.
*   **Equitable PCIBank v. Caguioa (G.R. No. 159170, August 12, 2005, 466 SCRA 686.):**  States leniency cannot offset dishonesty, even if the employee had years of service.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The applicability of General Circular 3-72/92 (requiring letters of introduction) specifically to dollar savings accounts was debated. The Supreme Court resolved this by applying the spirit of the law to dollar accounts, to prevent circumvention of the rules.
*   The CA argued that PNB shared the blame due to failing to post the withdrawal, but the SC said it was within PNB's prerogative to decide whom to charge.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA, finding that Velasco's "no-book" transaction, coupled with his failure to report the account overstatement, constituted serious misconduct justifying his termination. The SC emphasized that banking institutions thrive on public trust. The Court upheld the NLRC's decision, reinstating the forced resignation and ordering payment only of unpaid wages during the portion of the preventive suspension that violated the 30-day period mandated by the Labor Code. The bank was not insensitive to his plight.
