**Legal Document Summary: *David C. Lao and Jose C. Lao vs. Dionisio C. Lao*, G.R. No. 170585 (2008)**

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari concerning an intra-corporate dispute regarding the ownership of shares in Pacific Foundry Shop Corporation (PFSC). Petitioners David and Jose Lao claimed to be stockholders, seeking recognition as such, issuance of stock certificates, and the right to inspect corporate books. Respondent Dionisio Lao, president of PFSC, denied their claims.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Share Ownership:** The core issue is whether David and Jose Lao are validly recognized shareholders of PFSC. Section 63 of the Corporation Code is directly relevant, addressing certificate of stock issuance and transfer of shares.
*   **Stock Transfer Requirements (Sec. 63, Corporation Code):** The Supreme Court emphasizes the requirements for valid stock transfer, including:
    *   Delivery of the stock certificate endorsed by the owner.
    *   Recordation of the transfer in the corporation's stock and transfer book.
*   **Corporate Record Keeping:** Implies PFSC has an obligation to maintain accurate records of share ownership and transfers.
*   **General Information Sheet (GIS):** A key point of contention. The SC affirms that mere inclusion in the GIS isn't conclusive proof of share ownership. This is further explored in light of conflicting data with the corporate books of PFSC.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Dionisio Lao's Potential Liability:**  If petitioners could prove that Dionisio Lao illegally appropriated shares or misrepresented facts to their detriment, he could be exposed to liability for damages.
*   **Corporate Liability:** If PFSC improperly denied the petitioners their rights as shareholders, they could be held liable for damages.
*   **Risk of Future Litigation:** The dispute has already involved multiple levels of court, indicating an ingrained conflict that may necessitate future judicial or administrative intervention.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 63:** Governing the transfer of shares and stock certificates.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 137, Section 1**: addressed the voluntary inhibition of judges.
*   **_Uson vs. Diosomito, 61 Phil. 535_: ** An unregistered transfer is not valid as against the corporation.
*   **_Price & Sulu Development Corp. vs. Martin, 58 Phil. 707_: ** The cases reiterated the need for registration in the Stock and Transfer Book of the corporation.
*   **_Rivera vs. Florendo, G.R. No. L-57586, October 8, 1986_: ** An unregistered transfer is not valid as against the corporation.
*   **_Tan v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 206 SCRA 740_: ** Discussed the importance of the Stock and Transfer Book of the corporation.
*   **_Webb, et al. v. People of the Philippines, 276 SCRA 243 [1997]_: ** Regarding the basis for disqualification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points:**

*   **Sufficiency of GIS as Proof:** The central ambiguity lies in the weight given to the General Information Sheet versus the stock and transfer book in establishing shareholder status. The court clearly favors the latter, but this could be challenged if the corporate books are suspected of being inaccurate or fraudulent.
*   **Validity of Share Transfers:** Petitioners' claims rest on the assertion that they acquired shares from others (Lao Pong Bao and Dionisio Lao). The lack of documentation is a critical weakness. The court's presumption of regularity in private transactions benefits the respondent.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA's Amended Decision and the RTC decision. They held that the petitioners failed to prove they were shareholders of PFSC, emphasizing the lack of stock certificates in their names and the absence of registered transfers in the corporate books. The court also upheld the appellate justice's right to inhibit himself from the case.

**Potential Risks:**

* The petition's failure has placed the petitioners in a difficult position. Unless additional evidence materializes, it will be difficult to challenge their status as non-shareholders.
