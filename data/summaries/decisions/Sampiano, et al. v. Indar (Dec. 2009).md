## Legal Document Summary: *Mayor Hadji Amer R. Sampiano, et al. v. Judge Cader P. Indar* (A.M. No. RTJ-05-1953)

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Cader P. Indar for gross ignorance of the law, grave abuse of authority, manifest partiality, and impropriety.

**Facts:** The case stems from Judge Indar's issuance of an Order in SCA No. 12-173, a case for Prohibition and Injunction filed by Sumulong Sampiano Ogka (Ogka) against Mayor Hadji Amer R. Sampiano (Sampiano), PNB, and others, seeking to prevent the release of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) to Sampiano due to a disputed mayoral election. Judge Indar, *ex parte*, ordered PNB to hold the release of the IRA pending resolution of the case.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Court confirms RTC jurisdiction over injunction petitions under BP 129 Section 21, as the issue involved entitlement to TRO/injunction, not enforcement of election laws, despite the underlying election dispute.
*   **Section 286 LGC and automatic release of IRA:** The Court clarified that the automatic release of the IRA from the national treasury does not prevent the court from deferring or suspending the release to local officials when a legal question arises.
*   **Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) & Preliminary Injunction:** The Court determined that Judge Indar's Order was essentially a TRO. He violated Rule 58, Section 5 of the Rules of Court by issuing it *ex parte* without proper notice and hearing. An *ex parte* TRO has a limited validity that he exceeded.
*   **Bad Faith:** The Court found that there was no evidence of bad faith, dishonesty, or ill motive on the part of Judge Indar in issuing the Order. His actions were attributed to a cautious approach given the volatile political climate and family tensions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **BP 129, Section 21:** RTC's original jurisdiction over injunctions.
*   **Rule 58, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Requirements for issuing preliminary injunctions and TROs.
*   **Section 286, Local Government Code:** Automatic release of shares to LGUs.
*   **Dandoy v. Maglangit, G.R. No. 144652, December 16, 2005, 478 SCRA 195:** Jurisdiction over the subject matter.
*   **Columbres v. Madronio, A.M. No. MTJ-02-1461, March 31, 2005, 454 SCRA 185:** Nature of TROs.
*   **Planas v. Reyes, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1905, February 23, 2005, 452 SCRA 146:** Definition of bad faith.

**Obligations:** Respondent Judge violated his professional responsibility to know and apply the law, especially Rule 58, Section 5.

**Liabilities:** Respondent Judge was found guilty of ignorance of the law for violating Rule 58, Section 5 and was penalized with a fine of PHP 10,000.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ignorance as Defense:** Reliance on the absence of bad faith to mitigate the violation of explicit procedural rules.
*   **Subjective Interpretation:** The characterization of the Judge's order as essentially a TRO despite his assertion otherwise could be viewed as subjective.

**Conclusion:** Judge Indar was penalized for procedural lapses in issuing a de facto TRO without following Rule 58. However, mitigating factors such as the absence of bad faith and the tense local climate led to a fine rather than more severe sanctions. The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's jurisdiction over the matter while clarifying the scope of LGC Section 286 regarding IRA release.
