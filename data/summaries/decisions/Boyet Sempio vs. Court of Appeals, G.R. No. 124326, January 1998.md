## Legal Document Summary - *Sempio v. Court of Appeals and Tuazon* (G.R. No. 124326)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to reverse the Court of Appeals' decision remanding a case for injunction and damages (Civil Case No. 681-M-90) to the trial court. The central issue is whether the dismissal of the injunction case on grounds of *litis pendentia* or *res judicata* was proper, considering two other cases involving the same land (Civil Case No. P-1787-89 and Civil Case No. 181-M-90).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Land Ownership:**  Land originally owned by Sempio spouses and mortgaged to DBP. DBP foreclosed due to non-payment.
*   **Conflicting Claims:**
    *   **Sempio Spouses:**  Claimed lack of notice of foreclosure (Civil Case No. 181-M-90: Annulment of Foreclosure).
    *   **DBP:** Sought writ of possession (Civil Case No. P-1787-89).
    *   **Tuazon:** Purchased the property from DBP, intervened in the writ of possession case, and filed a separate injunction suit against Sempio's son (Civil Case No. 681-M-90: Injunction and Damages).
*   **Prior Judgments & their Impact:**
    *   RTC initially nullified the extrajudicial foreclosure in Civil Case No. 181-M-90. This was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.
    *   DBP's petition for a writ of possession (Civil Case No. P-1787-89) was denied.
    *   RTC dismissed Tuazon's injunction case (Civil Case No. 681-M-90) based on *lis pendens*, given the pending writ of possession case.
    *   Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the injunction case, leading to this petition.

**Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Lis Pendens & Res Judicata:**  The Supreme Court determined that *lis pendens* (and ultimately *res judicata* due to the resolution of Civil Case 181-M-90) **did** apply.  The court found the three elements of *lis pendens* were met:
    1.  **Identity of Parties:** Court found *substantial* identity, not absolute. Tuazon's interests were intertwined with DBP's (as a purchaser from DBP), thus a community of interest existed.
    2.  **Identity of Rights Asserted & Reliefs Prayed For:**  Despite differing forms of action, the core issue was Tuazon's claim to exclusive possession and enjoyment of the land based on her purchase from DBP. This right was dependent on the validity of the foreclosure proceedings.
    3.  **Judgment as Res Judicata:**  The Supreme Court's prior decision upholding the nullification of the foreclosure effectively extinguished DBP's (and, consequently, Tuazon's) claim to the land.  Therefore, re-litigating the ownership issue in the injunction case was barred.
*   **Purchaser in Good Faith:** The Court explicitly found that Tuazon was NOT a purchaser in good faith, since she bought the land knowing DBP wasn't the registered owner and failed to inquire about the rights of the Sempios who were in possession. *Claverias v. Quingco, 207 SCRA 66, 82 [1992]* and *Bautista v. Court of Appeals, 230 SCRA 446, 450 [1994]* are cited here concerning diligence of buyers.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Tuazon's Claim Extinguished:** The Supreme Court reinstated the RTC's dismissal of Tuazon's injunction and damages claim. Tuazon has no basis to prevent the Sempios from using the land or to claim damages. She likely has a claim against DBP for breach of contract, warranty, or unjust enrichment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main point of contention was whether Tuazon was a purchaser in good faith and whether *lis pendens* applied. The Court resolved this against Tuazon, but her potential claims against DBP remain unexplored.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and upheld the dismissal of Tuazon's injunction claim. This case reinforces the importance of due diligence in land transactions and the application of *lis pendens* (and now *res judicata*) to prevent re-litigation of settled issues. Tuazon, deemed a purchaser in bad faith, is bound by the outcome of prior litigation concerning the validity of DBP's foreclosure.
