**Legal Document Summary: *Armando Lagon v. Hon. Dennis A. Velasco and Gabriel Dizon* G.R. No. 208424 (2018)**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Issue:** Whether Section 2 of the Judicial Affidavit Rule (JAR) violates the right to due process by requiring a defendant to submit judicial affidavits *before* the plaintiff presents their case, allegedly infringing on the right to demur to evidence.

**Background:**

*   Dizon sued Lagon for Sum of Money based on a dishonored check issued for a Php 300,000 loan.
*   Lagon moved to dismiss based on prescription; Dizon amended the complaint.
*   Trial court (Judge Velasco) ordered both parties to submit judicial affidavits 5 days *before* trial under the JAR.
*   Lagon filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration, arguing that this requirement forced him to present evidence before the plaintiff rested, violating his right to due process and the rule on Demurrer to Evidence.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *denied* Lagon's Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 2, Judicial Affidavit Rule (JAR):** Mandates parties to file judicial affidavits of their witnesses and documentary evidence with the court and serve on the adverse party at least 5 days *before* pre-trial/preliminary conference or scheduled hearing (motion/incidents). Failure to comply results in waiver, subject to court's discretion and penalties.
*   **Order of Trial:** Lagon argued the JAR contravenes the standard order of trial and the rule on Demurrer to Evidence.
*   **Due Process:** Lagon asserted his right to due process was violated as he was forced to present his case prematurely.

**Liabilities:**

*   Lagon was liable to comply with the trial court's order to submit judicial affidavits. Failure to do so may result in the exclusion of his evidence.  He was fined Php 3,000.00 and ordered to reimburse Php 5,000.00 to Dizon for expenses.
*   Lagon was deemed *not* to have shown grave abuse of discretion on the part of Judge Velasco.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court *rejected* the argument that the JAR conflicts with the rule on Demurrer to Evidence. The Court held that a defendant can still file a demurrer to evidence if they believe the plaintiff hasn't established their case, based *solely* on the plaintiff's evidence.
*   Ambiguity may arise in practice regarding the application of the demurrer to evidence in conjunction with the JAR. While theoretically separate, a practical challenge may be the perception that submitting a defense via judicial affidavit could prejudice a subsequent demurrer.  The court states that the Judicial Affidavit and Demurrer to Evidence can coexist harmoniously, but the interplay can be nuanced.
*   The decision emphasizes the procedural efficiency goals of the JAR, potentially prioritizing speed over traditional adversarial procedures.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the 1987 Constitution:** Grants the Supreme Court the power to promulgate rules of procedure.
*   **A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC (Judicial Affidavit Rule):** The core regulation at issue.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 18, Section 6:** Pertains to the contents of pre-trial briefs, highlighting the early-stage requirement for defendants to formulate their defense.
*   *Tan v. Spouses Antazo, 659 Phil. 400, 403 (2011)*: Regarding the standard of grave abuse of discretion in certiorari petitions.
*   Numerous cases cited regarding the nature and purpose of demurrer to evidence.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case *upholds* the validity of the Judicial Affidavit Rule and its application in requiring defendants to submit judicial affidavits *before* the plaintiff presents their full case. The Court emphasizes the JAR's purpose of streamlining litigation and does not find it inherently violative of due process or in conflict with the right to demur. A lawyer advising a defendant must be aware of the JAR's requirements and ensure timely compliance. While the right to demur is theoretically preserved, the practical implications of submitting a detailed defense via judicial affidavit *before* knowing the full strength of the plaintiff's case should be carefully considered.
