**Case:** *Rodolfo A. Dela Cruz and Celerino A. Dela Cruz vs. Jesusa Y. Cailles, represented by Alicia Y. Yacat* (G.R. No. 257980, June 26, 2024)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the Petition for Review on Certiorari, reversing the CA's decision and reinstating the DARAB's decision, which ordered the dismissal of the Complaint for recovery of possession filed by Cailles (landowner) against Dela Cruz (agricultural lessees).  The dispute concerns a parcel of land in Gapan City where Dela Cruz were tenants. The SC determined that the Dela Cruz had not abandoned the land, despite executing a *Sinumpaang Salaysay* (Voluntary Surrender) seemingly relinquishing their rights.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Subject Deed (Voluntary Surrender):** The core issue revolves around the interpretation and effect of the *Sinumpaang Salaysay* executed by Dela Cruz. While facially appearing as a voluntary surrender of *pamomosisyon* (possession) and *karapatan na gawain* (tilling rights), the SC looked beyond the document's literal meaning. The SC acknowledged that it was a notarized document, entitling it to full faith and credit.
*   **Abandonment:**  The central legal issue is whether the Dela Cruz abandoned their leasehold rights under Section 8(1) of RA 3844. The Court elucidated the requisites for abandonment: (a) clear and absolute intention to renounce a right or claim; and (b) an external act expressing such intention. Case law cited: *Verde v. Macapagal* (571 Phil. 250 (2008)); *Corpuz v. Grospe,* 388 Phil. 1100 (2000).
*   **Continuous Cultivation:** The SC found substantial evidence that Dela Cruz continued active cultivation and were paying lease rentals. The acceptance of rentals by Yacat (landowner's representative), even from a third party (Carlito's wife) was found to create estoppel, implying consent to the transaction.
*   **Return of Possession:** Carlito had returned possession of the land within two years. The SC held that since the relinquishment of possession did not last for at least two years, there was no lawful cause to eject Dela Cruz.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Landowner (Cailles):**  The landowner has the obligation to respect the Dela Cruz's peaceful possession and cultivation of the subject land. The SC implies potential liability for attempting to unlawfully dispossess the tenants.
*   **Agricultural Lessees (Dela Cruz):**  Originally, the Dela Cruz had potential liability for violating Section 36(2) and (7) of RA 3844 (failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract or employing a sub-lessee), but this was negated by the DARAB's factual findings and upheld by SC decision that they continued active cultivation and that there was implied consent from the landowner.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity of the Deed:** The main point of contention was whether the *Sinumpaang Salaysay* genuinely reflected Dela Cruz's intent, given their claimed lack of education and alleged deception. While the SC held that the document was clear on its face, it ultimately sided with the DARAB's findings of fact.
*   **Estoppel:** The acceptance of lease payments becomes a contentious issue regarding whether the landowner knowingly consented to the transactions between the Dela Cruz and Carlito, leading to an estoppel.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Conflicting factual findings among the PARAD, DARAB, and CA required the SC to re-evaluate the evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):** Specifically Section 8(1) (extinguishment of agricultural leasehold relation by abandonment) and Section 36 (possession of landholding).

**Case Law:**

*   *Grossman v. North Sea Marine Services Corp.*
*   *Lozano v. Fernandez*
*   *Mata v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Malate Construction Development Corp. v. Extraordinary Realty Agents & Brokers Cooperative*
*   *Verde v. Macapagal*:  Relied upon by the Cailles but distinguished by the Court.
*   *Corpuz v. Grospe*: Cited for the elements of abandonment.
*   *Maylem v. Ellano*

**Legally Precise Note:** The SC emphasized that it is not a trier of facts, but relaxed this rule due to conflicting findings among the lower tribunals. The decision highlights the importance of "contemporaneous acts" in interpreting contracts, particularly in agrarian disputes. The estoppel argument was critical in negating any implication of wrongdoing of tenant sub-leasing.
