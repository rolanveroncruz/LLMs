**Legal Document Summary: *Obieta v. Cheok*, G.R. No. 170072 (2009)**

**Nature:** Intra-corporate dispute involving a request for stock certificate issuance (based on street certificates) and subsequent enforcement of a money judgment.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RTC Decision (Final & Executory):** The RTC initially held Joaquin P. Obieta (corporate secretary of REDECO) jointly and severally liable with REDECO for P695,873 plus interest, attorney's fees (25%), and costs of suit due to negligence in refusing Edward Cheok's stock certificate request. The underlying claim stems from Cheok's ownership of REDECO street certificates. The RTC found the street certificates to be genuine due to REDECO's admission of their issuance to the broker.
*   **Execution & Contempt:** The RTC ordered Obieta to surrender his VGCC stock certificate for public auction. Obieta's refusal led to a contempt citation.
*   **CA Decision (Reversed on Reconsideration):** The CA initially reversed the RTC, finding no bad faith or gross negligence to justify piercing the corporate veil. However, on reconsideration, the CA reversed itself, reinstating Obieta's solidary liability because the RTC decision had become final and executory despite potential errors of law.

**Obligations:**

*   **Obieta's Obligation:** Obieta is obligated to satisfy the judgment amount solidarily with REDECO, including the principal, interest, attorney's fees, and costs. His assets are subject to execution to satisfy the judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Obieta's Liability:**  Based on the now final RTC judgment, Obieta is held jointly and severally liable for damages arising from his alleged negligent acts.
*   **REDECO's Liability:** REDECO remains liable for the same judgment amount.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Judgment:** Obieta faces the risk of losing personal assets, including the VGCC stock certificate, to satisfy the judgment.
*   **Contempt Sanctions:** While the contempt citation was initially challenged, non-compliance with the execution orders could lead to renewed contempt proceedings.
*   **Limited Recourse:**  Given the finality of the RTC decision, any attempts to challenge the underlying finding of negligence are unlikely to succeed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Finality of Judgments:** Emphasizes the principle that a final and executory judgment is immutable and unalterable, even if erroneous. *Coloso v. Garilao, G.R. No. 129165, 30 October 2006*
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** Although initially discussed by the CA, the issue of piercing the corporate veil is no longer relevant due to the finality of the judgment against Obieta in his personal capacity.
*   **Rule 39, Sec. 9(b) of the Rules of Court:** Governs the execution of money judgments, specifically the levy on properties of the judgment obligor.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Basis for Negligence Finding:** The specific acts constituting "negligence" on Obieta's part are not fully elaborated upon in the summary but appears to stem from the failure to issue the shares of stock after the presentation of the certificates.
*   **Finality vs. Correctness:** The core issue is the tension between the legal principle of finality and the potential injustice of enforcing an erroneous judgment. The Court acknowledges the potential error in the RTC decision but prioritizes finality.

**Legal Advice:**

Given the Supreme Court's denial of the petition based on the finality of the RTC judgment, Obieta has limited options. He should focus on negotiating a settlement with Cheok to minimize further losses and avoid additional contempt sanctions. Further attempts to reopen the case are unlikely to succeed. A strategy involving REDECO's contribution to the settlement should also be explored, given its underlying corporate liability.
