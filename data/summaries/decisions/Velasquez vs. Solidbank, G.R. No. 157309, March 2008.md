## Legal Document Summary: Velasquez vs. Solidbank Corporation, G.R. No. 157309

**Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court, affirming the CA's decision holding Petitioner liable under a letter of undertaking.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Marlou L. Velasquez (Wilderness Trading) - Exporter
*   **Respondent:** Solidbank Corporation - Bank

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Letter of Credit (LC):** Goldwell Trading opened a letter of credit in favor of Wilderness Trading with the Bank of Seoul.
*   **Credit Accommodation:** Petitioner obtained pre-shipment financing from Respondent.
*   **Documentary Sight Draft:** Petitioner negotiated a sight draft drawn on the LC, payable by Bank of Seoul.
*   **Letter of Undertaking:** As a condition for the sight draft issuance, Petitioner executed a letter of undertaking in favor of Respondent, warranting the genuineness of documents and guaranteeing acceptance and payment of the sight draft. The letter included a hold-harmless clause and agreement to pay the full amount of the draft, with interest and charges, on demand.
*   **Dishonor & Stop Payment:** Bank of Seoul dishonored the sight draft (late shipment, forged inspection certificate, etc.). Goldwell Trading issued a stop payment order due to discrepancies (sea cucumber bags contained soil).
*   **Demand & Lawsuit:** Respondent demanded restitution. Petitioner failed to pay, leading to a suit for recovery of a sum of money.

**Core Legal Issue:** Whether Petitioner is liable under the sight draft (principal contract) or the letter of undertaking (accessory contract) despite the lack of protest of non-acceptance of the sight draft.

**Court's Holding:**

*   **No Liability Under Sight Draft:** The Court acknowledged that the failure to protest the non-acceptance of the foreign bill (sight draft) discharged Petitioner's liability *under the sight draft* as per Section 152 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL).
*   **Liability Under Letter of Undertaking:** The Court held that the letter of undertaking is a *separate and independent contract* from the sight draft. Petitioner's liability under the letter is direct, primary, and exists regardless of the dishonor of the sight draft. The consideration for the letter was the promise to pay upon dishonor.
*   **Guarantor Argument Rejected:** The court rejected the Petitioner's argument that he was merely a guarantor.
*   **No Proof of Violation Required:** Respondent did not need to prove a violation of the letter of credit to enforce the letter of undertaking; non-acceptance alone triggered liability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), Section 152:**  Cited regarding the necessity of protest for foreign bills of exchange.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1159:** Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 19 & 22** Unjust enrichment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Broad Scope of Undertaking:** The letter of undertaking includes broad language ("any other discrepancy or reason whatever") which exposes Petitioner to liability for various issues, even those potentially unrelated to his direct control.
*   **Unfairness:** The decision emphasizes good faith and avoiding unjust enrichment.
*   **Discrepancies:** The discrepancy regarding the sea cucumber potentially opens the door to another claim outside the letter of undertaking.
*   **Interest Rate:** The courts modified the original rate of 20% interest rate down to 12%.
