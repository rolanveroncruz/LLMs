**Legal Document Summary: La Campana Development Corporation v. Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)**

**Case:** G.R. No. 146157, February 13, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision to grant DBP's petition for certiorari and set aside the RTC's orders that suspended the execution of a prior CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **Originating Loan & Foreclosure:** La Campana obtained a foreign currency loan guaranteed by DBP, secured by a real estate mortgage. La Campana defaulted, DBP paid the creditor under the guaranty, and initiated extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Prior Litigation:** This case is rooted in a series of legal actions:
    *   La Campana initially filed a case to stay foreclosure, which reached the Supreme Court and was decided in favor of DBP.
    *   La Campana then filed another complaint to cancel the real estate mortgage due to DBP's failure to register the Certificates of Sale within 10 years (citing Arts. 1142 and 1144 of the Civil Code regarding prescription of mortgage actions).
    *   The RTC initially ruled in favor of DBP, ordering La Campana to surrender possession and pay unlawfully collected rentals.  This was reversed on motion for reconsideration. The CA then reversed this, ordering La Campana to surrender possession and pay rentals.
    *   La Campana's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied.
*   **Current Dispute (Execution):** DBP sought a writ of execution for the CA's ruling (CA-G.R. CV No. 34856), compelling La Campana to surrender possession and account for unlawfully collected rentals. La Campana opposed, arguing the decision was incomplete because it didn't specify the amount of unlawfully collected rentals or the period covered.
*   **RTC Orders:** The RTC initially granted the writ but then modified it, suspending execution of the rental payment aspect pending clarification from the CA regarding the exact amount due.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **La Campana:**
    *   **Obligation to surrender possession** of the properties covered by TCT Nos. 33035, 33036, 45869, 45870, 45871, 42868, and 23617.
    *   **Obligation to pay DBP** the sums of money unlawfully collected as rentals. The CA determined the period to be from May 1, 1976 (calculated based on the registration of sale).
*   **DBP:**  None explicitly stated in this document. Entitled to receive possession and rental payments.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Specificity:** While the CA determined the start date for rental collection, the *exact amount* due is not specified. This relies on La Campana's accounting, which could be disputed.
*   **Accounting Disputes:** The accounting process could lead to further litigation if DBP contests the figures provided by La Campana.  Evidence will need to be presented to establish what rentals were actually collected.
*   **Delayed Execution:** The extended litigation history poses a risk of further delays.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Arts. 1142 and 1144 of the New Civil Code:** Cited by La Campana in prior litigation regarding prescription of mortgage actions.
*   **Doctrine of Res Judicata:**  The Supreme Court emphasizes the need for finality in litigation.
*   **Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 65):**  Addressed the timeliness of DBP's petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Relevant Cases:**
    *   *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. L-65338, 3 December 1985, 140 SCRA 338, 345.* Regarding the Discretionary Clause found in the Mortgage Agreement.
    * *Policarpio v. Philippine Veterans Board,* Regarding the true intent and meaning of a decision.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **"Unlawfully collected rentals":**  The core dispute revolves around the lack of a specific amount in the CA decision.  La Campana argues the "unlawful" period needs to be determined. DBP and the SC say the period is determinable from the decision itself (May 1, 1977).
*   **Interpretation of Dispositive Portion:**  The RTC initially refused to conduct hearings to determine the amount, arguing it couldn't modify the CA's dispositive portion. The CA and SC disagreed, stating the RTC had inherent authority to receive evidence to implement the decision and that the start date of rental obligation could be gleaned from the judgement.

**Outcome & Implications:**

*   The Supreme Court denied La Campana's petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision.
*   The case was remanded to the RTC, which is now directed to conduct hearings to ascertain the exact amount of rentals/income collected by La Campana from the subject properties, from May 1, 1976, until possession is surrendered to DBP.
*   The ruling reinforces the principle that lower courts have the authority and, in some cases, the duty to conduct proceedings necessary to implement a final and executory judgment, even if the dispositive portion requires clarification by reference to the body of the decision.
