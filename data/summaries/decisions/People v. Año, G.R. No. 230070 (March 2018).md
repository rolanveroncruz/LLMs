## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Año* (G.R. No. 230070)

**Nature:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Holding:** Accused-appellant Nestor Año y Del Remedios acquitted. CA decision reversed and set aside.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or "Shabu") under RA 9165.
*   **Elements of the Crime:** The prosecution must prove (a) the identity of buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (b) delivery and payment.  Critical is the establishment of the *corpus delicti* (the drugs), and its identity established with moral certainty through an unbroken chain of custody. See *People v. Sumili* (753 Phil. 342).
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165):** The core issue is a failure to comply with the chain of custody requirements, specifically regarding mandatory witnesses. Section 21 (1) requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items in the presence of (a) the accused or his representative/counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the DOJ.  See *People v. Mendoza* (736 Phil. 749).
*   **Non-compliance Justification:** The prosecution failed to provide a credible explanation justifying the absence of media and DOJ representatives during the inventory and photography. *People v. Almorfe* (631 Phil. 51) states that the prosecution bears the burden to explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses. *People v. De Guzman* (630 Phil. 637) emphasizes that these justifiable grounds must be proven as fact.
*   **RA 10640 Amendment:** While RA 10640 amended Section 21, the original provisions apply to this case as the incident occurred prior to its effectivity.  The Court notes that RA 10640 incorporates the "saving clause" from the IRR into statutory law, but the prosecution still failed to demonstrate justifiable grounds for non-compliance.

**Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution:** Has the positive duty to prove compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 and to justify any deviations.  The failure to raise the issue below does not preclude appellate review.
*   **Apprehending Team:** Strictly adhere to the chain of custody requirements to ensure the integrity and evidentiary value of seized items.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:**  Was originally found guilty by the RTC and CA but acquitted by the Supreme Court due to the failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The "saving clause" in the IRR (and now RA 10640) regarding justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 is subject to interpretation.  The prosecution must convincingly demonstrate a valid reason for any procedural lapses.
*   The court underscores that Section 21 is a matter of substantive law, not merely procedural technicality and failure to comply results in doubt on integrity of evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5, Article II, Section 21

**Conclusion:** The court emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional rights, even for those accused of crimes, and cautions against sacrificing individual liberty in the name of order. The systematic non-compliance with chain of custody requirements leads to the acquittal of the accused due to reasonable doubt.
