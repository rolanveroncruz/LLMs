## Legal Document Summary: Calamba Medical Center, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Ronaldo Lanzanas and Merceditha Lanzanas, G.R. No. 176484

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari of the Court of Appeals' Amended Decision affirming with modification the NLRC's decision finding illegal dismissal of medical doctors-spouses Ronaldo and Merceditha Lanzanas.

**Key Provisions and Factual Background:**

*   **Employment Status:** Calamba Medical Center (CMC) engaged Drs. Ronaldo and Merceditha Lanzanas as resident physicians. They worked twice a week on 24-hour shifts, receiving a monthly retainer and a percentage of certain fees.
*   **Control Test:** The court focused on the "control test" to determine if an employer-employee relationship existed. Crucial elements: fixed work schedule set by CMC’s medical director (Dr. Desipeda), monitoring through nursing staff, and requirement for hospital approval for operations.
*   **Termination of Employment:** Dr. Ronaldo Lanzanas was suspended and subsequently terminated for alleged acts "inimical to the hospital's interest" and participation in a union strike (violating the return to work order). Dr. Merceditha was effectively terminated by not being given a work schedule, allegedly due to cost-cutting measures, but the court found it was due to her marriage to Dr. Ronaldo. A "watchlist" containing their names was allegedly circulated to other hospitals, hindering their future employment.
*   **Labor Dispute:** A strike by the rank-and-file employees union occurred. The Secretary of Labor issued a return-to-work order.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Dr. Ronaldo filed an initial complaint for illegal suspension, later amended to illegal dismissal. Dr. Merceditha filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. The Labor Arbiter initially dismissed for lack of jurisdiction (no employer-employee relationship), but the NLRC reversed. The CA initially granted CMC’s petition, but on motion for reconsideration, reinstated the NLRC decision with modified damages.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer Obligations:** CMC had the obligation to observe due process in terminating employees (notice and hearing). This includes informing the employee of the reason for dismissal and providing an opportunity to explain. The hospital is responsible for failure to comply with the Return to Work Order.
*   **Employee Obligations:** The employees are responsible for complying with the Retrun to Work Order.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misclassification of Employees:** The potential risk of CMC classifying doctors as independent contractors when an employer-employee relationship exists based on control and economic dependence.
*   **Unfair Labor Practices:** The circulation of a "watchlist" to prevent future employment could be deemed an unfair labor practice under Article 28 of the Civil Code, as found by the SC.
*   **Lack of Substantial Evidence:** Insufficient evidence to prove Dr. Ronaldo's actual participation in the strike was raised as a key issue in the appellate decision.
*   **Conjugal Attribution:** The dismissal of Dr. Merceditha based on her marriage to Dr. Ronaldo and presumed sympathy constitutes illegal discrimination and an unfounded basis for termination.
*   **Due Process Violations:** The lack of prior notice and hearing for both doctors, particularly Dr. Merceditha, creates procedural defects in the termination process.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **"Control Test" (Nogales v. Capitol Medical Center, G.R. No. 142625, December 19, 2006):** Used to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship.
*   **Article 97(f) of the Labor Code:** Defines "wage," potentially including the percentage of fees received by the doctors.
*   **Section 15, Rule X of Book III of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code:** Addresses employer-employee relationship between resident physicians and training hospitals.
*   **Article 263(g) of the Labor Code:** Addresses strikes affecting hospitals and the duty to maintain a skeletal workforce.
*   **Article 282 of the Labor Code:** Enumerates grounds for termination by an employer (cited regarding the lack of valid cause for Dr. Merceditha's dismissal).
*   **Article 28 of the Civil Code:** Provides a right of action for unfair competition in labor through unjust methods.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Addresses the recovery of attorney's fees.
*   **REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8282: Governs coverage under the SSS.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "managerial nature" of employee duties:** This was a point of contention related to the labor union activities.
*   **The sharing arrangement between the employer and employee is not the issue, it is that the respondents are not managerial or supervisory employee but are part of the rank and file employees**

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision with a modification reinstating the award of attorney's fees. It upheld the finding of illegal dismissal for both doctors and emphasized the lack of due process and substantial evidence supporting the termination.
