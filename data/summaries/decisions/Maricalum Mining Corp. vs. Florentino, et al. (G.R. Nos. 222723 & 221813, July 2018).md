**Case:** Maricalum Mining Corporation vs. Ely G. Florentino, et al., G.R. No. 221813 & Ely Florentino, et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. No. 222723 (July 23, 2018)

**Summary:**
These consolidated petitions involve a labor dispute concerning unpaid wages and other monetary claims filed by former employees (Respondents/Petitioners in G.R. No. 222723) of Maricalum Mining Corporation ("MMC", Petitioner in G.R. No. 221813) against MMC and G Holdings, Inc. ("GHI"). The core legal issue is whether GHI can be held liable for MMC's labor obligations, requiring consideration of piercing the corporate veil.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Separate Corporate Personality:** The Supreme Court ("SC") affirmed the principle that a corporation possesses a separate legal personality from its stockholders, but this veil can be pierced under certain circumstances. The SC acknowledged that the validity of the PSA between APT and G Holdings, thus establishing substantial control of G Holdings over Maricalum Mining
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil (Alter Ego):** The SC discussed the conditions under which the corporate veil can be pierced, focusing on: (1) Control - not merely stock control, but complete domination; (2) Use of control to commit fraud or wrong; (3) Proximate causation of injury. All three elements must be met.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting:** The court found MMC guilty of labor-only contracting with the manpower cooperatives and therefore solidarily liable.
*   **No Fraud:** SC found no fraud on the part of GHI. The transfer of assets from MMC to GHI was in line with valid privatization measures.
*   **Intervention:** SC affirmed the NLRC's decision to allow MMC to intervene on appeal.
*   **Liability:** The SC ultimately held MMC liable for the monetary claims. It held that the petitioners/Respondents failed to prove fraud or gross negligence on the part of G Holdings.
*   **Sipalay Hospital:** Separate entity. No affiliation proven with G Holdings. Employees' claims against G Holdings dismissed.

**Obligations:**

*   MMC is obligated to pay the monetary awards, but SC did not remand the case for recalculation of monetary awards.

**Liabilities:**

*   MMC is primarily liable for the unpaid wages and other monetary claims to the employees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Limited Asset Base of MMC:** The effectiveness of the judgment depends on MMC's ability to satisfy the monetary awards. The employees face the risk of MMC lacking sufficient assets.
*   **Future Claims:** If MMC is unable to satisfy all claims, future legal action against GHI might be pursued, potentially renewing the debate on piercing the corporate veil if new evidence arises.
*   **Statute of Limitations:**  Maricalum Mining contended some monetary awards were improperly computed because prescribed claims have been granted, as provided pursuant to Article 291 of the Labor Code.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic v. "G" Holdings, Inc.:** Affirmed the validity of the purchase of Maricalum Mining by G Holdings.
*   **DOLE Philippines, Inc. v. Esteva, et al.:** Established indicators of a labor-only contracting arrangement.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Hydro Resources Contractors Corporation:**  Outlines the elements for piercing the corporate veil based on the alter ego theory.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alter Ego/Control:** The level of control GHI exercised over MMC's labor practices remains a point of contention.
*   **Employee Status in Relation to G Holdings:**  The employees contend they were de facto employees of GHI due to its control over MMC's operations and the transfer of assets.
