Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Wilfredo Cawaling*, G.R. No. 157147, April 17, 2009.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Wilfredo Cawaling guilty of Murder for the death of Leodegario Capispisan. This case revolves around conflicting testimonies regarding the commission of the crime.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Cawaling was charged with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, alleging conspiracy with Palti Umambong (whose case was previously dismissed).
*   **Conflicting Testimonies:**
    *   **Prosecution:** Witness Rommel Brigido testified that he saw Cawaling shoot Leodegario. Gloria Capispisan corroborated this account.
    *   **Defense:** Palti Umambong, initially charged with Cawaling, testified that he alone shot the victim, citing a dispute over gambling winnings. Cawaling denied shooting the victim.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**
    *   **RTC:** Initially convicted Cawaling as an accomplice to Homicide, questioning Brigido's credibility due to delayed affidavit execution and conflicting details (e.g., the gun being covered by a handkerchief and the presence of Palti with a gun).
    *   **CA:** Reversed the RTC decision, finding the eyewitness testimony of Brigido and Capispisan credible and convicting Cawaling of Murder, citing treachery.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision. The Court favored the prosecution's eyewitness testimony, highlighting that the RTC judge did not personally hear the key prosecution witnesses and therefore had no better position to assess credibility.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Cawaling is liable for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Cawaling is obligated to pay P50,000 as indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages to the victim's heirs.
*   Bondsman Margarita Cruz is obligated to produce Cawaling or provide proof of death or face forfeiture of the property bond.

**Key Legal Principles & Case Law:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court reiterates the principle that the trial court's assessment of witness credibility is generally given deference. *People v. Vasquez, People v. Pacuancuan*.  However, this deference is lessened when the judge rendering the decision did not hear the primary evidence.
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** The Court reaffirms that the flight of an accused is indicative of guilt. *People v. Ambrocio, People v. Del Mundo*.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The Court upheld the CA's appreciation of treachery, stating that even a frontal attack can be treacherous if sudden and unexpected, precluding the victim from defending themselves. *People v. De Castro, People v. Valdez*.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Court implied that Palti Umambong was able to falsely confess as the case against him had been dismissed due to double jeopardy.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses** conflicting and belated testimonies were central to the case and could have been a point of contention.
*   **Double Jeopardy** The Court suggests that Palti Umambong's testimony was false due to being able to confess to a crime he could no longer be held accountable for.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 248 (Murder)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 114, Sections 1, 22 (Bail)
*   Philippine Constitution, Article III, Section 21 (Double Jeopardy)

**Outcome:**

Wilfredo Cawaling was found guilty of Murder, as well as, ordered to pay indemnity and moral damages. The Motion of Movant Cruz was denied.
