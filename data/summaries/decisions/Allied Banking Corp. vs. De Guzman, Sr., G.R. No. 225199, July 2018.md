**Case:** *Allied Banking Corporation (now Philippine National Bank) v. Eduardo De Guzman, Sr.* G.R. No. 225199, July 9, 2018 (835 Phil. 985)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, which upheld the RTC's dismissal of PNB's complaint against De Guzman based on the finding that De Guzman effectively revoked his Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety prior to the obligations arising.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety (Feb. 14, 1990):** De Guzman, along with other incorporators of Yeson International Philippines, Inc., jointly and severally guaranteed the company's obligations to Allied Bank (now PNB). Clause stipulating agreement remains valid until written revocation received by PNB.
*   **Trust Receipts (1992):** Yeson International executed several trust receipts with Allied Bank.
*   **Promissory Note (April 30, 1993):** Yeson International's obligation was consolidated into a promissory note.
*   **Second Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety (June 23, 1993):** New surety agreement executed *without* De Guzman's participation after company failed to pay obligations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PNB's Claim:** PNB sought to hold De Guzman liable as surety for Yeson International's unpaid loan and trust receipt obligations.
*   **De Guzman's Defense:** De Guzman argued that he validly revoked the initial surety agreement before the trust receipts were executed and before the execution of the promissory note.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Revocation of Guaranty:** The core dispute revolves around whether De Guzman's alleged revocation letter (sent Sept. 4, 1991) was properly sent and received by PNB. Ambiguity exists due to the post office's inability to certify receipt due to record disposal.
*   **Superseding Agreement:** Whether the second surety agreement superseded the first, effectively releasing De Guzman from liability. PNB contends that the second surety agreement doesn't negate the first.
*   **Pleading Amendment:** PNB argues that the RTC and CA erred in considering De Guzman's defense of revocation because it wasn't initially pleaded. The court ruled this was permissible due to PNB's implied consent during trial.
*   **Proof of Mailing/Receipt:** The case hinges on the presumption of receipt of a mailed letter and the evidence needed to establish mailing and overcome that presumption.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law.
*   **Section 3(v), Rule 131, 1997 Rules of Court:** Establishes the disputable presumption that a duly directed and mailed letter was received.
*   *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Metro Star Superama, Inc.*, 652 Phil. 172 (2010): Outlines requirements for proving mailing (registry receipt or return card).
*   *Mangahas v. CA*, 588 Phil. 61 (2008): Emphasizes the importance of the original registry receipt as evidence of mailing.
*   **Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court:** Allows amendment of pleadings to conform to evidence presented with the express or implied consent of the parties.
*   *Barcelon, Roxas Securities, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 529 Phil. 785 (2006).*
*  *Republic vs. Court of Appeals, 149 SCRA 351.*
*  *Gonzalo P. Nava vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 13 SCRA 104.*
* *Palecpec, Jr. v. Hon. Davis, etc., 555 Phil. 675, 694-695 (2007).*

**Analysis for Lawyer:**

The case presents a factual dispute regarding the revocation of a surety agreement. Key elements for review are the evidence presented by De Guzman to prove mailing and the weight given to the presumption of receipt. PNB's failure to object to the revocation defense during trial weakens its argument against its consideration. The strength of De Guzman's defense rests on the court's acceptance of the registry receipt as sufficient proof of mailing, despite the lack of a post office certification of receipt. PNB's appeal is likely to fail given the Supreme Court's deference to factual findings of lower courts. This is especially the case where a question of fact involves only the assessment of the evidence submitted by the parties.
