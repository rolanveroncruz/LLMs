## Legal Document Summary: *Limkaichong vs. COMELEC* (G.R. NOS. 178831-32, 179120, 179132-33, 179240-41)

This is a Resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Louis C. Biraogo regarding the Supreme Court's April 1, 2009 Decision which reversed the COMELEC's disqualification of Jocelyn Sy Limkaichong from running for Congress in Negros Oriental's First District due to alleged lack of natural-born citizenship.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Citizenship Requirement:** The core issue is Limkaichong's qualification as a natural-born citizen under Section 6, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution for House of Representatives membership.
*   **Denaturalization Proceedings:** The Court reiterates that challenging a naturalized citizen's status (in this case, Limkaichong's father) requires proper denaturalization proceedings initiated by the Solicitor General or their representative under Section 18 of Commonwealth Act No. 473.  Private individuals cannot raise this issue collaterally in an election case (citing *Queto v. Catolico*).
*   **COMELEC Jurisdiction:**  The Court reaffirms that once a winning candidate is proclaimed, takes their oath, and assumes office, COMELEC's jurisdiction over election contests relating to their election, returns, and qualifications ceases, and the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) gains sole jurisdiction (Section 17, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, Section 250 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) and *Vinzons-Chato v. COMELEC*). Alleged irregularities in the proclamation do not divest HRET of jurisdiction.
*   **HRET Rules & Prescriptive Period:**  The ten-day prescriptive period under the HRET Rules does *not* apply to disqualification based on citizenship as this is a continuous requirement (citing *Frivaldo v. COMELEC*).  The proper petition can be filed before HRET at any time during incumbency.
*   **Unpromulgated Decision:** An unpromulgated decision (referring to a prior draft decision by Justice Reyes) has no legal effect and remains confidential. Only signed and promulgated decisions are binding (citing *Belac v. COMELEC*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Those seeking to challenge Limkaichong's citizenship must do so via a proper petition before the HRET.
*   The State, through the Solicitor General or their representative, has the obligation to initiate denaturalization proceedings if the father's citizenship is challenged.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The primary risk is the continued challenge to Limkaichong's citizenship, which could lead to her removal from office if a successful petition is filed with the HRET.
*   The scope of "at any time during her incumbency" is not explicitly defined and could be subject to interpretation by the HRET.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution:** Section 6, Article VI; Section 17, Article VI
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 473:** Section 18
*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Section 250
*   **Queto v. Catolico:**  Regarding proper denaturalization proceedings.
*   **Aquino v. COMELEC:** On citizenship being a mandatory requirement to hold public office.
*   **Vinzons-Chato v. COMELEC:** Regarding the jurisdiction of the HRET post-proclamation.
*   **Frivaldo v. COMELEC:**  Regarding citizenship as a continuing requirement.
*   **Belac v. COMELEC:** On the validity of promulgated versus unpromulgated court decisions.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The statement "at any time during her incumbency" is potentially contentious and subject to interpretation by the HRET.
