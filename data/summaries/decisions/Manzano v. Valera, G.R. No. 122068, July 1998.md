**Legal Document Summary: Manzano v. Valera, G.R. No. 122068**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging the Municipal Trial Court's (MTC) jurisdiction over a criminal libel case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) or MTC has original jurisdiction over libel cases, particularly in light of Republic Act (RA) 7691.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in favor of the Petitioner, holding that the RTC, not the MTC, has exclusive original jurisdiction over libel cases, notwithstanding RA 7691.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Explicitly vests jurisdiction over libel cases with the Courts of First Instance (now RTC).
*   **RA 7691:** Amended Section 32 of Batas Pambansa (BP) 129, expanding the jurisdiction of first-level courts (MTCs) to include offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding six (6) years. The respondent Judge erroneously reasoned that since the penalty for libel falls within this range, the MTC has jurisdiction.
*   **SC Rejection of MTC Jurisdiction:** The SC relied on the principle that a special law (Art. 360 RPC) prevails over a general law (RA 7691) regardless of enactment dates. Precedent cases of *People v. MTC of Quezon City* (265 SCRA 645) and *Caro v. CA* (G.R. No. 122126) were cited, affirming the RTC's exclusive jurisdiction. RA 7691 specifically excludes cases falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC and the Sandiganbayan.
*   **Implied Repeal:** The SC emphasized that RA 7691 did not expressly repeal or alter the jurisdiction over libel cases, and implied repeals are disfavored. An implied repeal requires an irreconcilable inconsistency between the laws, which was deemed absent.
*   **Administrative Order No. 104-96:** This administrative order issued by the SC definitively states that libel cases shall be tried by the RTCs.

**Obligations:**

*   The MTC of Bangued, Abra is ordered to forward Criminal Case No. 5728 to the Executive Judge of the RTC of Abra for proper disposition.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent Judge's orders dated August 2 and 30, 1995, were declared null and void for lack of jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Incorrect Interpretation:** The initial misinterpretation of RA 7691 by the lower court highlights the risk of applying general jurisdictional statutes without considering specific provisions and established case law regarding particular offenses like libel.
*   **Filing in Improper Venue:** Filing a libel case in the incorrect court (MTC instead of RTC) will result in dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, causing delays and potentially barring the action due to prescription.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 360**
*   **Republic Act No. 7691**
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 32**

*   **Berces, Sr. vs. Guingona, Jr., 241 SCRA 539**
*   **Administrative Order No. 104-96**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Section 6 of RA 7691 regarding inconsistencies with existing laws was a point of contention. The Solicitor General incorrectly argued that no existing law expressly confers exclusive original jurisdiction over libel cases to the RTC, a view rejected by the SC.
