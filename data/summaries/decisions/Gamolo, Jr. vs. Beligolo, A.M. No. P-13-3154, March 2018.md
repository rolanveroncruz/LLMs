**Case Summary: _Rube K. Gamolo, Jr. v. Reba A. Beligolo_ (A.M. No. P-13-3154, March 07, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Administrative complaint against Reba A. Beligolo, a Court Stenographer II, for gross neglect of duty/inefficiency (failure to timely transcribe stenographic notes) and habitual absenteeism/tardiness.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 24-90:** Mandates stenographers to transcribe notes and attach them to case records within 20 days of taking them. This is the core obligation at issue.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 02-2007 (Reiteration of AC No. 2-99):** Strict observance of working hours and disciplinary action for absenteeism and tardiness.
*   **Respondent's Duty:** To timely transcribe and submit stenographic notes (TSNs) and orders and maintain regular attendance and punctuality.

**Findings & Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty (Violation of AC 24-90):** Found guilty. While respondent eventually submitted TSNs/orders, she failed to prove timely submission. Memoranda from the Acting Presiding Judge and complainant confirm the delays. Cites *Absin v. Montalla* regarding the importance of timely submissions.
*   **Habitual Tardiness (Violation of AC 02-2007):** While respondent admitted tardiness, it did not meet the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 23, series of 1998 definition of habitual tardiness, and was therefore admonished.
*   **Unauthorized Absences:** Charges dismissed as the leave applications were eventually approved.

**Penalties:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** Fine of P5,000.00, with a warning about more severe penalties for future similar acts.  Cites *Seangio v. Parce* regarding the possibility of imposing a fine in lieu of suspension for simple neglect, particularly when no ill or malicious motive is proven.
*   **Habitual Tardiness:** Admonishment and stern reminder to observe working hours.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Clear Intent:** The decision emphasizes the absence of bad faith or fraud in the delay, mitigating the penalty. Future delays, even without demonstrable intent, could lead to harsher penalties.
*   **Documentation of Compliance:** The case highlights the importance of meticulously documenting the date of transcription and submission of TSNs.
*   **Definition of "Timely":** The decision focuses on non-compliance. There is no discussion of what constitutes a legitimate excuse for delays.
*   **Precedent Setting:** The case acts as a reminder of the importance of timely submission of transcriptions. Future violations could lead to harsher penalties.
