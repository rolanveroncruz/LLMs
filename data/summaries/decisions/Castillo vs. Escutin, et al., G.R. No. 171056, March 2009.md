## Legal Document Summary: *Castillo v. Escutin, et al.*, G.R. No. 171056

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the Ombudsman's dismissal of administrative (grave misconduct) and criminal (violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019) complaints against public officials and private individuals.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Dispute Origin:** Petitioner, a judgment creditor, levied on execution a 1/3 pro-indiviso share of a parcel of land (Lot 13713) owned by judgment debtor Raquel Moratilla.
*   **Conflicting Claims:** Lot 13713 was later claimed to be encompassed within a larger parcel (Lot 1-B) covered by a Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT No. 129642) in the name of Francisco Catigbac, later transferred to Summit Realty.
*   **Alleged Irregularities:** Petitioner alleges irregularities in the transfer of title to Summit Realty, including a possibly invalid Special Power of Attorney (SPA), the prior death of Catigbac, and the rapid issuance of a new TCT (T-134609) to Summit Realty.
*   **Ombudsman Dismissal:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaints, finding no substantial evidence of grave misconduct or probable cause for violation of RA 3019. The Ombudsman deferred to the Register of Deeds' (Escutin) ministerial duty to register documents seemingly in order.
*   **Cancellation of Tax Declaration:** Petitioner's tax declaration (TD No. 00942-A) for her share of Lot 13713 was cancelled based on the TCT in Catigbac's name (TCT No. 129642), later transferred to Summit Realty, leading to the complaints.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The core issue revolves around whether respondent public officials violated their duties by improperly facilitating the transfer of title to Summit Realty, thereby causing injury to the petitioner.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Collateral Attack on Title:** The Supreme Court emphasizes that a certificate of title (TCT) cannot be collaterally attacked. Petitioner's allegations regarding the validity of the SPA and the sale to Summit Realty constitute such a collateral attack, and are outside the scope of the administrative proceeding before the Ombudsman.
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The Register of Deeds argued and the Ombudsman accepted that his duty to register the Deed of Absolute Sale was ministerial. This hinges on whether the documents presented were "legal and in due form" (citing Section 56 of PD 1529).
*   **Substantial Evidence Standard:** The Court reiterates that the Ombudsman's findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, deferring to the Ombudsman's and CA's judgment of the evidence.
*   **Tax Declaration vs. Title:** The court emphasizes that a tax declaration does not constitute conclusive evidence of ownership, as compared to the certificate of title. *Cervantes v. Court of Appeals, 404 Phil. 651, 659 (2001).*

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 48 (Collateral Attack), Section 56 (Primary Entry Book and Registration), and Section 109 (Lost Duplicate Certificate).
*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Section 3(e).
*   **Act No. 3344:** Recording of instruments on unregistered lands.
*   **Domingo v. Quimson (A.M. No. P-1518, 19 August 1982):** Defines misconduct and serious misconduct in administrative law context.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Legal and Due Form" of Documents:** The definition of "legal and due form" regarding the Deed of Absolute Sale becomes contentious.  Petitioner alleges that the deed was defective due to the absence of Summit Realty's signature, lack of Tax Identification Numbers (TIN), questionable Board Resolution, and Catigbac's death. However, the court found this insufficient to overturn the registration.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the charges against the public officials and private individuals, deferring to the Ombudsman's finding that there was no substantial evidence of grave misconduct or violation of RA 3019. The decision stresses the indefeasibility of a Torrens title and the limited role of the Register of Deeds in a ministerial registration process, effectively blocking the Petitioner's claim. *Barrera v. Court of Appeals, 423 Phil. 559, 569-570 (2001).*
