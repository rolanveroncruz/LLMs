## Legal Document Summary: People v. Roy, G.R. No. 225604 (2018)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Dionesio Roy y Peralta (Appellant) for statutory rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Statutory Rape:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the conviction, emphasizing the elements of statutory rape: (1) victim under 12 years of age; (2) carnal knowledge, irrespective of force, threat, intimidation, or grave abuse of authority. *People v. Ronquillo, G.R. No. 214762, September 20, 2017; People v. Cadano, Jr., 729 Phil. 576, 584 (2014)* cited. Consent is irrelevant due to the victim's age.
*   **Credibility of the Victim:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' finding that the testimony of the victim (AAA), a 9-year-old girl, was credible, consistent, and corroborated by the eyewitness testimony of Bartulay, the medical findings of Dr. Tan (diagnostic of blunt force trauma), and the Medico-Legal Report. *People v. Vergara, 724 Phil. 702, 709 (2014)* cited re: giving full weight and credit to testimonies of child victims.
*   **Defense of Insanity/Imbecility:** The SC rejected the appellant's defense of imbecility (moderate mental retardation) under Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code, which requires *complete* deprivation of rationality at the time of the crime. *People v. Legaspi, 409 Phil. 254, 268 (2001)* cited. The appellant failed to overcome the presumption of sanity. Dr. Domingo's report was deemed inconclusive regarding the appellant's mental state at the time of the rape. The Appellant's awareness of the act (covering the victim's mouth and isolating her) contradicted a claim of complete lack of mental capacity.
*   **Damages:** The SC modified the CA decision regarding damages to align with *People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 848 (2016)*. The Appellant was ordered to pay the victim (AAA):
    *   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P75,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00
    *   All damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. Nacar v. Gallery Frames, 716 Phil. 267, 282 (2013) cited.
    *   R.A. No. 7610, R.A. No. 9262, and Section 40 of A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC used to withhold identifying information.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The acceptance of the eyewitness testimony, while deemed credible by the court, hinges on the witness's account and recollection, which could be subject to challenge given the passage of time and potential for memory distortion.
*   Dr. Domingo's report was inconclusive and didn't establish the appellant's insanity at the time of the rape. However, there could still be arguments regarding diminished capacity, potentially relevant for mitigation in sentencing.
* The reliance on *People v. Jugueta* for the determination of damages.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Appellant is obligated to pay the victim the specified amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, subject to interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant is criminally liable for statutory rape under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Appellant is civilly liable for the damages awarded to the victim.
