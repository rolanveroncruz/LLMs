## Legal Document Summary: Valley Golf & Country Club, Inc. vs. Rosa O. Vda. de Caram (G.R. No. 158805)

**Case Summary:** This case concerns Valley Golf & Country Club's (VGCC), a non-stock corporation, sale of a fully-paid membership share owned by the late Fermin Z. Caram, Jr. due to unpaid dues, authorized by the corporate by-laws. The respondent, Caram's widow, challenged the validity of the sale.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Validity of By-law Allowing Sale:** Central issue is whether VGCC could sell Caram's share based on its by-laws when the Articles of Incorporation (AOI) didn't authorize a lien for unpaid dues.
*   **Section 91 of the Corporation Code:** The court holds this section to be the governing rule as it deals with the termination of membership in Non-Stock corporations, explicitly allowing causes for termination (and by extension forfeiture of the Golf Share) to be established in the by-laws alone.
*   **Notice & Due Process:** Whether Caram and his estate were properly notified of the delinquencies and the impending sale, given his death. The Court emphasized that a "final notice" sent to the deceased Caram, knowing of his death, constituted bad faith.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The by-laws did not require the Club to refund the remainder of the proceeds of the sale after the outstanding obligation is extinguished.
*   **Applicability of Corporation Code Sections:**
    *   VGCC conceded that Section 67 of the Corporation Code (delinquent subscription sales) is inapplicable.
    *   The SEC and CA incorrectly relied on Section 6 of the Corporation Code (restrictions on shares must be in the Articles of Incorporation); Court held Section 91 is the proper rule.
*   **Human Relations:** The Court invoked Articles 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code due to the bad faith exhibited by VGCC, citing the general obligation for fair dealing.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **VGCC's Obligation:** The Court finds VGCC acted in bad faith, and is liable for moral and exemplary damages for besmirching the reputation of the Plaintiff.
*   **Compliance with Substantial Justice:** The Court notes that termination of membership must be done in accordance with substantial justice.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **By-law Enforcement:** The by-law provisions on termination of membership, while facially valid, lack specificity regarding notice procedures, creating potential for abuse and unfair deprivation of property rights.
*   **No refund mechanism**: The absence of a provision in the by-laws requiring a refund to the discharged member may disquiet concerns of undue loss of property rights corresponding to termination of membership.
*   **Interplay of Corporation Code and Civil Code:** When membership involves a property right (the Golf Share), the Court implies that termination must also comply with the Civil Code.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code (BP 68):** Sections 6, 67, 91, 98, 109.
*   **Civil Code:** Articles 19, 20, 21, 414, 2085, 2093, 2095, 2124, 2217, 2229.
*   **Chattel Mortgage Law (Act No. 1508):** Section 5.
*   **Long v. Basa (G.R. Nos. 134693-94):** Distinguished due to the property right associated with the membership.

**Conclusion:**

The Court DENIED the petition, affirming the CA and SEC decisions. The sale of the Golf Share was deemed invalid due to VGCC's bad faith and the lack of substantial justice in the termination process, even though the by-laws seemingly authorized the sale. This case highlights the need for non-stock corporations to ensure fair and transparent procedures for membership termination, especially when property rights are involved.
