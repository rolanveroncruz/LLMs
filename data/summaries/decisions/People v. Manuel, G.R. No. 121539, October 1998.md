## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Manuel*, G.R. No. 121539 (1998)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Honesto Manuel y Padilla*

**Nature:** Appeal from a trial court decision finding the accused-appellant, Honesto Manuel, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:** The accused-appellant, acting as a caretaker for his 11-year-old cousin-in-law, Nestcel Marzo, allegedly had carnal knowledge of her while his wife was hospitalized. The victim testified to the act, corroborated by medical findings of recent loss of virginity. The accused denied the allegations, claiming he desisted after removing her panty, then masturbated.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding the accused guilty of rape.

**Key Provisions & Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Statutory Rape (Art. 335 RPC):** The court emphasized that since the victim was under 12, no proof of involuntariness was necessary, and only the fact of intercourse needed to be proven. *Ignacio* (G.R. No. 114849).
*   **Penetration Requirement:** Full penetration is not required for rape; penile entry into the labia of the pudendum suffices. *Evangelista* (G.R. No. 121627), *Tabugoca* (G.R. No. 125334).
*   **Lack of Semen:** The absence of semen in the victim's vagina did not negate the rape because penetration up to the hymen was proven and ejaculation is not an element of the crime. *Oliva* (G.R. No. 108505).
*   **Victim's Credibility:**  The court relied on the trial court's assessment of the victim's credibility as a naive 11-year-old and the lack of any ill-motive to falsely accuse the defendant. The testimony of child-victims are given full weight and credit.
*   **Inconsistencies:** The court addressed minor inconsistencies in the victim's testimony regarding the accused's position, deeming them immaterial considering her age and the consistent assertion of penetration.
*   **Moral Damages**: The court also ruled that the Accused is ordered to pay â‚±50,000.00 in Moral Damages. *Prades* (G.R. No. 127569).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  The accused is found guilty of rape and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** The accused is ordered to pay the victim P50,000 as indemnity and P50,000 in moral damages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Conviction largely rested on the victim's testimony and medical evidence showing a recent loss of virginity. The lack of corroborating evidence beyond this could present challenges to the prosecution's case if scrutinized under a stricter evidentiary standard.
