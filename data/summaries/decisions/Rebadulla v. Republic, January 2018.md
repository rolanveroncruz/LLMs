## Legal Document Summary: Rebadulla v. Republic (G.R. Nos. 222159 & 222171)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision regarding just compensation for land taken by the DPWH for the SWIM Project.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Taking:** DPWH took parcels of land in 1997 for the SWIM Project without formal expropriation proceedings.
*   **Just Compensation:** Dispute over the amount of just compensation. Landowners (Rebadullas) rejected the DPWH's initial offer.
*   **Action Filed:** Landowners filed a complaint for mandamus and damages seeking just compensation.  The RTC and CA correctly construed the action as one for recovery of just compensation, as return of the property was not feasible.
*   **Valuation:** RTC initially based just compensation on BIR zonal valuation (P7.00/sqm). CA affirmed this valuation but modified the interest rate. The Supreme Court found the use of Zonal valuation as insufficient alone.
*   **Interest:** Initially 6% per annum from filing of the complaint (RTC), increased to 12% by the CA. The Supreme Court modified interest rate to 12% from the taking in 1997 until June 30, 2013, then 6% until finality, compounding from judicial demand (2002). Furthermore 6% on the entire judgment amount until it's completely paid.
*   **Area Taken:** Affirmed CA's finding that 154,521.49 sqm were taken, despite conflicting claims.
*   **Damages/Attorney's Fees:** CA reversed RTC award of attorney's fees and denial of damages, finding no proof of malice or bad faith by the government actors. SC upheld this decision.

**Obligations:**

*   **Republic (DPWH):** Obligated to pay just compensation for the land taken.
*   **Landowners:** Obligated to pay any deficiency in docket fees, which will be a lien on the judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Republic (DPWH):** Liable for just compensation, compounded interest from 1997 (date of taking), legal fees for initiating litigation. No one individual was held liable.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Valuation Uncertainty:** The value of just compensation must still be determined by the RTC on remand.  The actual amount could be higher or lower than the initial zonal valuation used. This also means the land owners will incur further legal expenses, and it's unclear how to fund that until the resolution of the case.
*   **Docket Fees:** Deficiency in docket fees will be a lien on the judgment, potentially reducing the net recovery for the landowners.
*   **Appeal:** Any new decisions could once again be appealed by either party.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 9:**  "No private property shall be taken for public use without just compensation."
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 9, Section 1:** Defenses not pleaded are waived, but lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any time.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 67:** (On expropriation) held inapplicable as the Republic never filed for eminent domain
*   **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Circular No. 799:** Amended interest rates (6% legal interest).
*   **Civil Code, Article 2212:** (Compounding Interest).
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals and Nacar v. Gallery Frames:** Legal Principles for computing interest.
*   **Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways v. Tecson (713 Phil. 55 (2013)):** Established taking must be calculated as of the date taken, not the date of the filing of the Complaint.
*   **Republic v. Asia Pacific Integrated Steel Corporation (729 Phil. 402, 415, (2014)):** Case law on valuation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Determination of Just Compensation:** The primary contentious issue remains the determination of "just compensation." The SC rejected the sole reliance on zonal valuation, requiring the RTC to consider other factors, but without specific guidance. The phrase is subject to interpretation and further litigation. The evidence presented was insufficient and new supporting information is needed.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Prepare for Valuation Hearing:**  Thoroughly prepare for the valuation hearing on remand.  Gather expert appraisal reports, comparable sales data, and other evidence to support a favorable valuation.
*   **Re-assess Docket Fees:** Conduct a detailed review of the docket fees paid and potential deficiencies.
*   **Monitor Interest Calculation:** Carefully monitor the interest calculation to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling.
*   **Counsel with Experts:** Consult with legal counsel specializing in eminent domain and real estate appraisal to maximize recovery.
