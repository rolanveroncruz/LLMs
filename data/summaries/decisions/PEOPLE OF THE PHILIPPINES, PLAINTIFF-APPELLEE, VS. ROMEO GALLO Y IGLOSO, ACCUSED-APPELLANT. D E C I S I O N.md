**Case Summary: *People v. Gallo***

**Citation:** 348 Phil. 640 (G.R. No. 124736, January 22, 1998)

**Parties:** People of the Philippines (Plaintiff-Appellee) v. Romeo Gallo y Igloso (Accused-Appellant)

**Subject Matter:** Automatic review of a death penalty conviction for rape under Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 22 of Republic Act No. 7659.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** The Accused-Appellant, Romeo Gallo, was charged with rape under the Revised Penal Code for an incident alleged to have occurred in May 1994 against Marites Gallo y Segovia, his daughter, then 13 years old. The information stated the act was "with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation"
*   **Facts:** The Accused-Appellant, Romeo Gallo, was convicted of raping his 13-year-old daughter.  The court heard testimony from the victim, detailing repeated instances of sexual abuse starting when she was 10 years old. The last instance of rape was in 1994 where there was the insertion of the penis into the vagina of the daughter and where the daughter was threatened with death. A medical examination confirmed the victim's non-virginity.
*   **Defense:** The defense presented Romeo Gallo as a provider for his family.
*   **Statutory Basis:** Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659.  The Court referenced the law which dictates the penalties for rape. Due to the Accused-Appellant being the parent of the victim, the law calls for the mandatory imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Ratio Decidendi:** The Court affirmed the trial court's reliance on the victim's testimony, finding it credible and coherent despite cross-examination.  The court reiterated the cautious approach to rape cases but emphasized that a credible lone testimony from the complainant is sufficient for conviction.  The court recognized the typical delay in reporting rape due to fear and shame and how the victim in this case was only 10 years of age when the first act occurred.
*   **Holding:** The Court affirmed the conviction for rape and the imposition of the death penalty. The civil indemnity was increased to P50,000.00.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Romeo Gallo is criminally liable for rape and faces the death penalty. He is also obligated to pay civil indemnity of P50,000.00 to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constitutionality of Death Penalty:** The decision notes dissent from two members of the Court who favored a *reclusion perpetua* sentence on constitutional grounds. This indicates potential vulnerability to future challenges based on evolving jurisprudence regarding capital punishment.
*   **Factual Disputes and Witness Credibility:** The case hinges heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony.  Any future challenges might focus on attacking this credibility, potentially through character evidence or highlighting inconsistencies.
*   **Pardoning Power:** The Court directs that records be forwarded to the Office of the President for a possible exercise of the pardoning power, indicating some awareness of the severity of the penalty and potential for executive clemency.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People vs. Malagar* (238 SCRA 512): Used to illustrate the disturbing nature of incestuous rape.
*   *People vs. Galera* (G.R. No. 115938, 10 October 1997): Emphasizes the extreme circumspection used in death penalty reviews.
*   Cited cases regarding witness credibility in rape cases, including *People vs. Tacipit*, *People vs. Rivera*, etc.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The decision does not delve into the specific nature of the "force and intimidation" used beyond the victim's testimony of a death threat.
