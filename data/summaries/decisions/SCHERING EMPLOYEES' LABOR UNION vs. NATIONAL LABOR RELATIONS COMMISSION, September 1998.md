## Legal Document Summary: *Schering Employeesâ€™ Labor Union v. NLRC, Schering-Plough Corp., and Titong* (G.R. No. 118586)

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65, seeking to annul the NLRC's resolution affirming the Labor Arbiter's order that amended a prior order dismissing a case based on a motion to withdraw.

**Key Issue:** Whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in upholding the Labor Arbiter's amendment of a final and executory order.

**Facts:**

*   SELU filed a complaint against SPC for violation of a CBA provision regarding improvement of the retirement plan.
*   SELU filed a Motion to Withdraw the complaint based on an alleged agreement improving the plan to 155%/160% per year of service "without vesting schedules."
*   The Labor Arbiter granted the withdrawal motion and dismissed the case on July 14, 1992, including the phrase "without vesting schedules" in the order.
*   SPC filed a Motion to Amend the order, claiming no agreement to remove vesting schedules, only to improve the salary credit formula.
*   The Labor Arbiter granted the motion, deleting "without vesting schedules."
*   NLRC affirmed this amendment, stating the initial order didn't rule on vesting schedules.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion. The Labor Arbiter's Order dated July 14, 1992 dismissing the case was considered a *final and executory* order despite not being an adjudication on the merits because it terminated the litigation, as established in *Investments, Inc. vs. CA, 147 SCRA 334, at 339*.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement):** Obligation for SPC and SELU to jointly improve the retirement plan within 9 months.
*   **Retirement Plan:** Initially provided for graduated retirement benefits (vesting schedule) and a salary credit formula of 1.5.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **NLRC's Action:** The NLRC committed a grave abuse of discretion, this being a violation of Section 17, Rule V of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC, and an unpermissible circumvention of the ten-day period. *Ramones vs. NLRC, 219 SCRA 62, at 68* stipulates the ten-day period for appeal under Art. 223 of the Labor Code which is "not only mandatory but also jurisdictional."

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Investments, Inc. vs. CA, 147 SCRA 334, at 339:** defines a "final judgment or order."
*   **Marcopper Mining Corporation vs. Liwanag Paras Briones, et al., 165 SCRA 464:** invoked by respondents; addresses amendment of final/executory judgments (cited in the comment by the SolGen, which was in favor of the petition).
*   **Turgueza vs. Hernando, 97 SCRA 483; First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Hernando, 199 SCRA 706, at 804; Villanueva vs. CFI of Oriental Mindoro, 119 SCRA 288, at 297; Garcia vs. Echiverri, 132 SCRA 639:** once a decision or order becomes final and executory, it is removed from the power or jurisdiction of the court which rendered it to further alter or amend
*   **Ramones vs. NLRC, 219 SCRA 62, at 68; Lucero vs. NLRC, 203 SCRA 218, at 224; Narag vs. NLRC, 155 SCRA 199:** the ten-day period for appeal under Art. 223 of the Labor Code is "not only mandatory but also jurisdictional."

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 (Rules of Court):** Basis for the petition for certiorari.
*   **Art. 223 (Labor Code):** Sets the 10-day period for appealing Labor Arbiter decisions.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Without vesting schedules"**: Inclusion in the initial dismissal order caused the dispute. SPC argued it never agreed to its removal, which was the main point of contention.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the vesting schedule issue was moot and academic. The vesting schedules were maintained in the new CBA entered into by petitioner SELU and SPC on August 16, 1993.

**Analysis for a Lawyer:**

This case highlights the importance of precision in legal documentation and the finality of orders. While the ultimate issue was rendered moot, the procedural errors of the Labor Arbiter and NLRC could have had serious consequences. The case underscores that the ten-day appeal period under the Labor Code is jurisdictional, and failing to adhere to it can have detrimental effects. Furthermore, It may also be used in subsequent CBA negotiations.
