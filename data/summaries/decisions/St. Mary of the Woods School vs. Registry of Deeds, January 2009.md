Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *St. Mary of the Woods School, Inc. vs. Office of the Registry of Deeds of Makati City*, G.R. Nos. 174290 and 176116.

**Case Summary: St. Mary of the Woods School, Inc. vs. Office of the Registry of Deeds of Makati City**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated special civil actions for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 challenging Court of Appeals (CA) Resolutions regarding the reinstatement of a Notice of Lis Pendens and the denial of a Motion to Dismiss Appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 85561.

**Facts:**

*   **Underlying Dispute:** Hilario Soriano (Respondent) filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 03-954) in the RTC Makati against St. Mary of the Woods School, Inc. (SMWSI) and others, seeking the nullification of a Deed of Assignment and subsequent Deeds of Sale that transferred properties originally owned by his deceased father, Tomas Soriano, to Oro Development Corporation (ODC), and eventually to SMWSI (Petitioner). Respondent alleged forgery of his father's signature on the initial Deed of Assignment.
*   **Lis Pendens:** A Notice of Lis Pendens was initially annotated on the TCTs.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC dismissed the complaint due to failure to state a cause of action, failure to comply with Article 222 of the Civil Code (family compromise), and estoppel (based on Respondent's prior acknowledgment of the Deed). The RTC also ordered the cancellation of the Notice of Lis Pendens.
*   **CA Proceedings:** Respondent appealed to the CA. While the appeal was pending, the CA granted Respondent's Motion to Reinstate/Re-annotate the Notice of Lis Pendens and denied the Petitioners' Motion to Dismiss the Appeal. The CA also ordered the Register of Deeds to submit original documents for NBI signature analysis.
*   **Petition to SC:** Petitioners (SMWSI and Marcial Soriano) filed petitions for Certiorari with the Supreme Court (SC), arguing grave abuse of discretion by the CA.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The SC addressed whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the reinstatement of the Notice of Lis Pendens and denying the Motion to Dismiss the Appeal.
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens (Sec. 14, Rule 13, Rules of Civil Procedure; Sec. 77, PD 1529):**  The Court discussed the purpose of lis pendens and the grounds for cancellation (molestation or unnecessary to protect rights).  The CA reinstated the notice, noting that the property remained the subject of litigation.
*   **Failure to State a Cause of Action:** The RTC dismissed the complaint based partly on this ground, leading to the appeal and the question of whether the appellate jurisdiction rested with the Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court.
*   **Questions of Law vs. Questions of Fact:** The Court addressed the distinction between these questions in determining the proper venue for the appeal.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The Petitioners alleged the Respondent was forum shopping by raising the motion of Lis Pendens, simultaneously with the initial appeal.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The Registry of Deeds is obligated to follow court orders regarding annotation/cancellation of the Notice of Lis Pendens.
*   Parties acquiring interest in the property after the Notice of Lis Pendens are bound by the outcome of the litigation.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Allegation:** The allegation of forgery of Tomas Soriano's signature remains a central factual issue. The CA's order for NBI analysis suggests the court is still investigating this aspect, despite the RTC's initial dismissal.
*   **Estoppel Defense:** The SC decision highlights the prior acknowledgment by Hilario (Respondent) of the Deed of Assignment as the basis for Estoppel, as a central issue on the dismissal of the case.

**Holding:** The SC DISMISSED the Petitions for Certiorari. The SC held that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion, justifying its decision on the following basis:

*   The Petitioners failed to file a Motion for Reconsideration with the CA before filing the Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 174290, failing to meet the conditions precedent for filing such a petition.
*   As the case was appealed to the CA, the appellate court was correct in determining it had jurisdiction over the lis pendens issue.
*   The dismissal of the initial appeal did not constitute forum shopping.
*   The RTC made a determination on the record of the question of forgery, which meant it fell within the jurisdiction of the CA to determine that the analysis of signatures was necessary.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure (Certiorari and Prohibition)
*   Section 14, Rule 13 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (Notice of Lis Pendens)
*   Section 77, Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) (Cancellation of Lis Pendens)
*   Article 222 of the Civil Code of the Philippines (family compromise)

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The decision cites several cases on grave abuse of discretion, forum shopping, and the purpose of lis pendens.
