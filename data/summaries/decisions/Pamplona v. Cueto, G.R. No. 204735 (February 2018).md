**Case Summary: *Spouses Cipriano Pamplona and Bibiana Intac v. Spouses Lilia I. Cueto and Vedasto Cueto*, G.R. No. 204735, February 19, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Specific performance, conveyance, consignation, and damages arising from a dispute over an alleged oral contract to sell real property.

**Facts:**

*   Sps. Cueto (Respondents) claimed an oral contract to purchase property from Sps. Pamplona (Petitioners) for US$25,000, payable in monthly installments of US$300.
*   Respondents asserted partial performance through remittances totaling US$14,000, possession via their son Rolando, and tax payments.
*   Petitioners denied the sale, claiming the remittances were repayment of a previous loan and asserting ownership based on TCT No. RT-1504 (34558).
*   Petitioners initiated an unlawful detainer action against Rolando, resulting in his eviction.
*   Respondents then tendered the remaining balance and filed this action.
*   RTC ruled for Petitioners; CA reversed, ordering specific performance and cancellation of Petitioners' TCT.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Alleged Oral Contract to Sell:** Respondents bear the burden of proving the existence and terms of this agreement. The alleged agreement is for US$25,000 payable in monthly installments of US$300.
*   **Obligation to Convey:**  CA ordered Petitioners to execute a Deed of Absolute Sale upon release of the consigned amount.
*   **Title Transfer:**  CA ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel Petitioners' title and issue a new one to Respondents.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Specific Performance:** Petitioners are compelled to transfer property ownership.
*   **Costs of Suit:** Petitioners are ordered to pay the costs.
*   **Potential Liability for Damages:** Though not explicitly awarded, the original complaint sought damages. The risk of such an award remains should the legal basis for damages claims can be proven.
*   **Challenges to Title:** The ruling creates a cloud on the Petitioners' title and potentially jeopardizes any subsequent transactions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Statute of Frauds (Art. 1405, New Civil Code):** Petitioners argued the oral agreement violated the Statute of Frauds.  The CA held that partial performance removed the contract from its application.
*   **Contracts to Sell vs. Contracts of Sale:**  The Court cites *Serrano v. Caguiat* (G.R. No. 139173, February 28, 2007) and *Sing Yee v. Santos* (1951) to distinguish between the two types of contracts, emphasizing that in a contract to sell, ownership remains with the vendor until full payment. This distinction is critical to understanding why Roilan and Vedasto's admissions regarding Petitioners' ownership were not necessarily inconsistent with the Respondents' claims.
*   **Article 1491 of the Civil Code:** The CA voided the transfer of rights from Petitioners to Redima, due to the conflict of interest, involving Petitionersâ€™ counsel, Atty Dimayacyac. The Supreme Court declined to resolve this issue due to due process concerns for Redima and Atty. Dimayacyac.
*   **Rule 130, Section 32 of the Rules of Court:** Discussed admission by silence and the rule that one party is not prejudiced by the act, declaration, or omission of another party.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Terms of the Alleged Oral Agreement:** The precise terms of the oral agreement (specifically regarding payment schedule, default provisions, etc.) are not documented, making enforcement reliant on witness testimony and circumstantial evidence.
*   **Nature of Remittances:**  The fundamental dispute is whether the remittances were loan repayments or installment payments on the purchase price. The lack of clear documentation leaves this open to interpretation.
*   **Validity of Transfer to Redima:** While not directly addressed by the Supreme Court, the potential violation of Art. 1491 poses a significant risk. The corporate veil argument requires further examination of the relationship between Atty. Dimayacyac and Redima.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   The Supreme Court has affirmed the lower courts, finding partial performance of the oral contract.
*   The Statute of Frauds is no longer a viable defense.
*   Challenging the transfer of rights to Redima could be pursued in a separate action involving Redima and Atty. Dimayacyac, addressing due process concerns.
*   Focus should be on mitigating damages and ensuring compliance with the specific performance order.
