## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Banal na Pag-aaral, Inc. (G.R. No. 193305)

**Nature:** Land Registration Case Appeal.

**Key Issue:** Admissibility of evidence (DENR Certification declaring land alienable and disposable) submitted for the first time on appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Decision:** CA Amended Decision reversed, case REMANDED to the CA for further proceedings to determine the authenticity and due execution of the DENR Certification.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Banal na Pag-aaral's Obligation:** To prove the land sought for registration is alienable and disposable land of the public domain, a fundamental requirement in land registration cases.
*   **CA's Authority (Limited):** Section 9 of Batas Blg. 129 (as amended by RA 7902) grants the CA the power to receive evidence, but this power is generally limited to cases where a new trial has been granted. The CA's admission of the DENR Certification on appeal, without granting a new trial, was deemed procedurally incorrect.
*   **Evidence Submission Rules:** Evidence must be formally offered (Rule 132, Sec. 34, Revised Rules on Evidence) to be considered.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Banal na Pag-aaral's Risk:** Failure to convincingly prove the authenticity and due execution of the DENR Certification on remand could lead to denial of land registration. Risk of incurring further legal expenses.
*   **Republic's Risk:** Possible loss of government land if Banal na Pag-aaral successfully demonstrates alienability and disposability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Blg. 129, Sec. 9 (as amended by RA 7902):** Defines the CA's power to receive evidence.
*   **Rule 132, Sec. 34, Revised Rules on Evidence:** Requires formal offer of evidence.
*   **Crispino et al., v. Tansay, G.R. No. 184466, December 05, 2016:** Cited to support the limited scope of the CA's power to receive evidence on appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   The CAâ€™s authority to admit evidence not previously offered is a contentious issue, with the Supreme Court citing Crispino v. Tansay to emphasize its limited application.
*   The authenticity and due execution of the DENR Certification is crucial, especially since it was submitted belatedly. The Supreme Court did not explicitly endorse the document's admissibility, but remanded for further proceedings, suggesting a willingness to consider it if properly authenticated.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **For Banal na Pag-aaral:** Focus on gathering compelling evidence to establish the authenticity and due execution of the DENR Certification. Be prepared for rigorous scrutiny by the CA.
*   **For the Republic:** Thoroughly investigate the DENR Certification's origins and challenge its authenticity and due execution if discrepancies are found. Ensure proper procedural compliance during the remand proceedings to protect the government's interest.
