## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Gajo*, G.R. No. 217026

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Holding:** Appeal GRANTED. Accused-Appellants Lawrence and Rico Gajo acquitted due to reasonable doubt. CA decision reversed and set aside.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charges:** Illegal sale and illegal possession of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) under RA 9165.
*   **Conviction Below:** RTC found accused guilty based on buy-bust operation testimony and physical evidence. CA affirmed, stating the chain of custody was substantially complied with.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling Rationale:** The Court found significant breaches in the chain of custody of the seized drugs, creating reasonable doubt as to the *corpus delicti*.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 Compliance:** The Court emphasized strict compliance with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) regarding chain of custody, physical inventory, and photographing of seized items.

**Critical Chain of Custody Failures:**

1.  **Improper Marking:** Marking of the seized *shabu* was not done "immediately upon seizure" as per best practice, but later at the police station. The marking also did not occur in the presence of the accused, a failure that potentially compromises the integrity of the evidence. *Cites People v. Ismael* regarding immediate marking and presence of the accused.
2.  **Missing Witness Testimony:** The investigating officer (PC/Insp. Benzon) did not testify. *Also, P02 Cruz* who submitted the evidence to the crime laboratory did not testify either, creating critical gaps in accounting for the evidenceâ€™s movement and handling.
3.  **Inventory & Photographing:** No physical inventory or photographs were taken in the presence of the accused, their counsel, a media representative, and a DOJ representative or elected public official as mandated by RA 9165. No justifiable explanation for this non-compliance was provided.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Charges for illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21 (as amended by RA 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   ***People v. Ismael*:** Emphasizes the importance of immediate marking of seized drugs and presence of the accused, holding that failure to do so casts doubt and can warrant acquittal.
*   ***People v. Barte*:** This case is noted to have similar issues with reliance on civilian informants and the potential for abuse in buy-bust operations.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The Court stressed that the accused's constitutional right to the presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption of regularity of police duties when there is evidence of non-compliance with RA 9165.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The prosecution's attempted reliance on "substantial compliance" with the chain of custody was rejected due to the significant and unremedied gaps.
*   The conflicting testimonies of PO3 Justo and PO1 San Pedro regarding whether there was a commotion at the time of the arrest further undermined the credibility of the prosecution's account.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Civil Actions:** The acquitted accused may have grounds for civil actions against the involved police officers and the state for illegal arrest, detention, and potential violations of constitutional rights.
*   **Administrative Sanctions:** The police officers involved may be subject to administrative disciplinary actions for failure to follow proper procedures in handling drug evidence.
*   **Loss of Evidence Integrity:** This case highlights the potential for mishandling of evidence in drug cases and the need for rigorous adherence to chain of custody protocols.

**Overall:** The Supreme Court prioritized strict adherence to procedural safeguards under RA 9165 to protect against potential abuses in drug enforcement, ultimately leading to the acquittal of the accused. The decision emphasizes the importance of documenting every link in the chain of custody and the consequences of failing to do so.
