**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ang*** (G.R. No. 181245, August 6, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction for illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Sec. 6(l) and (m) of RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act): illegal recruitment. Specific acts include excessive fees, failure to deploy without valid reason, and failure to reimburse expenses.

*   **Elements of Illegal Recruitment:** The court clarifies that for violations under Sec. 6(l) and (m) of RA 8042, proof of being a non-licensee or non-holder of authority is *not* required as an element of the crime.  The enumerated acts are unlawful regardless of license status.

*   **Large Scale Illegal Recruitment:** Defined as committed against three (3) or more persons (RA 8042).  Triggers economic sabotage penalties.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Defendant (Jimmy Ang):**  Convicted of illegal recruitment in large scale. Liable for:
    *   Life Imprisonment
    *   Fine: Increased from P100,000 to P500,000 by the Supreme Court.
    *   Actual Damages: Ordered to pay back complainants' amounts of P20,000.00, P115,000.00, P150,000.00 and P50,000.00, to the respective complainants.
    *   Legal Interest: Obligation to pay legal interest on the actual damages from the filing of the Information until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Argument & Rejection:** Ang argued that lack of proof he was unlicensed was fatal to the prosecution's case. Court rejected this citing the specific sections he was charged under (Sec. 6(l) and (m)), for which his licencing status was not relevant. This highlights the importance of understanding *which* specific provision of RA 8042 is invoked.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):**  Central statute; specifically Sec. 6(l) and (m) defining illegal recruitment.
*   **PD 442 (Labor Code):** Referenced in RA 8042 regarding licensing requirements, though its precise relevance to the ultimate holding is diminished because Sec. 6(l) and (m) does not require proof of not possessing one.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, emphasizing that for violations of RA 8042 Sec. 6(l) and (m), lack of a license is not an element of the crime. This decision reinforces the strict liability associated with certain illegal recruitment activities and the severe penalties for large-scale offenses categorized as economic sabotage.
