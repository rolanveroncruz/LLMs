## Legal Document Summary: *Renita del Rosario, et al. vs. Makati Cinema Square Corporation* (G.R. No. 170014)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging CA decision upholding NLRC's reversal of the Labor Arbiter's ruling on illegal suspension and dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the dismissal of petitioners (ticket sellers/portresses) on the ground of loss of trust and confidence due to alleged involvement in a ticket recycling scheme.

**Holding:** Petition denied. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the dismissal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 282 (c) of the Labor Code:** Allows termination for "fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer."
*   **Loss of Trust and Confidence:** Requires a willful breach of trust, done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse. A reasonable ground to believe in the employee's responsibility for the misconduct is sufficient.
*   **CBA Renegotiation:** Union proposed amendments to the CBA on the grounds for renegotiation of the economic provisions for the remaining two years of the CBA.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:** To present substantial evidence proving the employee's involvement in the alleged misconduct to justify dismissal based on loss of trust and confidence.
*   **Employee's Potential Liability:** Termination for cause (fraud/breach of trust) if evidence of involvement in misconduct is established.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Wrongful Termination Claim:** If the employer fails to provide substantial evidence of employee misconduct, they risk an illegal dismissal finding and associated back pay and reinstatement orders (or separation pay if reinstatement is not feasible).
*   **ULP Claims:**  Employees alleged ULP based on union-busting, discrimination, coercion, illegal suspension, and dismissal because the respondent ceased operation shortly after the union informed respondent of its intention to renegotiate the economic provisions.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 282 of the Labor Code:** Basis for termination by employer for cause, including loss of trust and confidence.
*   ***Easycall Communications Phils., Inc. v. King*, G.R. No. 145901, 15 December 2005:** Defines "loss of confidence" and the requirement of willful breach.
*   ***National Bookstore, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 428 Phil. 235 (2002):** Defines "willful breach" and the requirement of intentional, knowing, and purposeful action without justification.
*   ***Ca√±eda v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 152232, 26 February 2007:** Emphasizes that the employer only needs a "reasonable ground to believe" in the employee's culpability, based on clearly established facts.
*   ***Schering Employees Labor Union (SELU) et al. v. Schering Plough Corporation*, G.R. No. 142506, 17 February 2005:** Addresses ULP claims related to CBA renegotiation and the burden of proof.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The weight given to the affidavits of the employer's witnesses (Gimena, Welsh, and Derupe) versus the dismissed criminal case (originally dismissed for insufficiency, then reversed on reconsideration, then leading to an acquittal for failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt). The standard of proof differs between criminal and labor cases (proof beyond a reasonable doubt vs. substantial evidence).
*   The timing of the dismissals in relation to the CBA renegotiations and the cessation of theater operations raises questions regarding the employer's motives, though the court found no substantiation of ULP.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court prioritized the employer's right to protect its assets and maintain employee integrity over the employees' claims of ULP and wrongful termination. The Court found substantial evidence, even in the absence of a criminal conviction, to support the employer's loss of trust and confidence.
