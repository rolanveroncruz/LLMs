## Legal Document Summary: *Administrator vs. Batongbacal & Roxas* (A.M. No. P-06-2190)

**Nature:** Administrative case involving former court personnel for gross dishonesty, gross misconduct, malversation of public funds, and related violations of Supreme Court circulars.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Administrator (presumably the Office of the Court Administrator - OCA)
*   **Respondents:**
    *   Arturo Batongbacal (former Clerk of Court, MTC Pulilan, Bulacan): Already found guilty in a prior resolution and dismissed. Current issue concerns his Motion for Reconsideration and restitution obligations.
    *   Remedios Roxas (Court Stenographer I, and former Officer-in-Charge, MTC Pulilan, Bulacan): Newly included respondent.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Batongbacal's Prior Findings:** Found guilty of gross dishonesty, gross misconduct and malversation of public funds. Dismissed, salary withheld, disqualified from government re-employment. His Motion for Reconsideration is pending compliance with directives regarding restitution and document submission.
*   **Batongbacal's Obligations (Unfulfilled):**
    *   Restitution of shortages: General Fund (P26,919.00), Judiciary Development Fund (P57,467.00), Fiduciary Fund (P298,179.00).
    *   Submission of documentation supporting withdrawals of cash bonds totaling P600,800.00.  Failure to provide documents results in obligation to restitute the entire P600,800.00.
*   **Roxas's Findings:** Guilty of gross neglect of duty, dishonesty, grave misconduct and malversation of public funds related to mishandling of court funds in her capacity as OIC.  Key evidence includes failure to deposit collections on time, unauthorized withdrawals of cash bonds, and failure to file accurate monthly reports.
*   **Roxas's Obligations:**
    *   Restitution of shortages: Philippine Mediation Center Trust Fund (P1,000.00) and Fiduciary Fund (P276,000.00) + an additional fiduciary fund shortage of P491,500.00 due to unauthorized withdrawals.
    *   Submission of missing documentation to support cash bond withdrawals totaling P499,500.00, otherwise, she must restitute this entire amount.
*   **Penalties for Roxas:** Dismissal from service, forfeiture of retirement benefits (including withheld salaries and leave credits), disqualification from government re-employment.  OCA directed to file criminal charges.
*   **OCA Direction:** OCA to submit its evaluation, report and recommendation on Arturo S. Batongbacal's Motion for Reconsideration within 10 days.
*   **SC Circular Violations:** The Court extensively cites violations of SC Circular Nos. 13-92, 50-95, 32-93, and Administrative Circular No. 5-93, emphasizing the stringent requirements for handling and reporting court funds.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Batongbacal:** Continued liability for outstanding shortages and potential liability for P600,800.00 if documentation for cash bonds is not provided.
*   **Roxas:** Solidary or joint and several liability (to be determined in separate proceedings) for shortages and unauthorized withdrawals. Potential criminal liability for malversation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Batongbacal's Motion for Reconsideration:**  The outcome hinges on the OCA's upcoming report.  The court has not ruled out the possibility that his prior dismissal could be upheld or even worsened based on any new evidence.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The burden of proof is shifted to both respondents to provide documentation justifying withdrawals.  Failure to do so equates to admission of malversation. *Vilar v. Angeles* is cited regarding *prima facie* evidence.
*   **Roxas's Defense:** Her defense of being a "victim of circumstances" due to the actions of the presiding Judge and Batongbacal was rejected. The court emphasized her duty as an accountable officer, regardless of her temporary status.
*   **Solidary vs. Several Liability:** The document does not explicitly state whether liabilities are joint or several. This will likely need clarification in subsequent proceedings or the corresponding criminal cases. Given the nature of the offense and the possible conspiracy, solidary liability is a strong possibility.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** Roxas faces imminent criminal prosecution for malversation.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Vilar v. Angeles* (A.M. No. P-06-2276, February 5, 2007, 514 SCRA 147): Cites failure to remit funds as *prima facie* evidence of personal use.
*   *Concerned Citizen v. Gabral, Jr.* (A. M. No. P-05-2098, December 15, 2005, 478 SCRA 13): Outlines the elements of malversation.
*   *In Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted in the MTCC-OCC, Angeles City* (A.M. No. P-06-2140, June 26, 2006, 492 SCRA 469): Emphasizes the high ethical standards required of judiciary employees.
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Fueconcillo* (A.M. No. P-06-2208, August 26, 2008, 563 SCRA 276)
*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Varela* (A.M. No. P-06-2113, February 6, 2008, 544 SCRA 10, 21)

**Next Steps:**

*   Await the OCA's report and recommendation on Batongbacal's Motion for Reconsideration.
*   Prepare defense for Roxas in the criminal case, focusing on mitigating circumstances and challenging evidence.
*   Investigate potential solidary liability and assess the possibility of cross-claims against Batongbacal and the former Presiding Judge to allocate responsibility.
*   Attempt to locate and present any missing documentation regarding the cash bond withdrawals.
*   Calculate the precise amounts owed by Roxas, taking into account forfeited salaries and leave credits, and explore options for settlement or payment plans.
