## Legal Document Summary: *Union Bank v. CA, et al.* (G.R. No. 131729, May 19, 1998)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari filed by Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank) challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which dismissed Union Bank's Petition for Certiorari against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The core issue revolves around the SEC's jurisdiction over a petition for suspension of payments filed by EYCO Group of Companies (EYCO) *and* its controlling stockholders (Yutingcos). Union Bank also raised issues of forum-shopping and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 902-A, Sec. 5(d):** Grants the SEC "original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving... Petitions of corporations, partnerships or associations to be declared in the state of suspension of payments". This is the central statutory provision at issue.
*   **Revised Rules of Procedure in the Securities and Exchange Commission, Section 1, Rule XXIII:** Provisions of the Rules of Court apply suppletorily to those Rules of the SEC, unless inconsistent.

**Key Issues & Court Holding:**

1.  **Jurisdiction of SEC:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirms prior case law (***Chung Ka Bio v. Intermediate Appellate Court***, ***Traders Royal Bank v. Court of Appeals***, ***Modern Paper Products, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***) establishing that the SEC's jurisdiction over suspension of payments is limited to petitions filed by corporations, partnerships, or associations. The SC finds that the SEC **lacks jurisdiction over individual petitioners (Yutingcos)** when they are joined as co-petitioners with a corporation. The court, referencing ***Section 11, Rule 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure*** on misjoinder of parties as read with ***Revised Rules of Procedure in the Securities and Exchange Commission, Section 1, Rule XXIII*** held that misjoinder is not a ground for dismissal. The Court ordered to drop the Yutingcos from the petition filed before the SEC. The EYCO corporation is not barred from filing a suspension of payment petition before the SEC.

2.  **Non-Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies & Forum Shopping:** The SC agrees with the CA that Union Bank failed to exhaust administrative remedies by directly appealing to the CA without first appealing the SEC Hearing Panel's decision to the SEC *en banc* (as provided for in *PD 902-A, Sec. 6(m)*). The SC finds no valid justification for bypassing the administrative process. The SC also found that the issues raised by Union Bank in the Motion to Dismiss before the SEC and in its Petition for Certiorari are identical.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Union Bank:** Union Bank is liable for costs.
*   **EYCO:** EYCO remains subject to the SEC's jurisdiction regarding its suspension of payments petition, provided it complies with the requirements for suspension.
*   **Yutingcos:** Yutingcos will have to pursue remedies in the regular courts since the SC affirmed that SEC does not have jurisdiction over individuals.
*   **Risk of Insolvency Proceedings:** The underlying financial difficulties of EYCO remain a significant risk, potentially leading to insolvency proceedings if suspension of payments is not granted.
* **Doctrine of Piercing the Veil of Corporate Fiction -** the SC held that the Yutingcos and the corporate entities making up the EYCO Group should not be considered as mere individuals on the basis of the footnote that the former were filing the petition because they bound themselves as surety to the corporate obligations. The SC found that there is no legal ground which should lead one to such conclusion. The doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction heavily relied upon by the petitioner is entirely misplaced, as said doctrine only applies when such corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Sufficient Property to Cover Debts" Requirement:** The ruling emphasizes the allegations in the petition determine jurisdiction. The determination of whether EYCO *actually* possesses sufficient property to cover all debts or is already insolvent is crucial but remains to be proven on the merits.

**Overall:**

This case clarifies the scope of the SEC's jurisdiction regarding petitions for suspension of payments under PD 902-A, emphasizing its limitation to corporations, partnerships, and associations. It also underscores the importance of exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention and the prohibition against forum-shopping. The case underscores the critical distinction between a corporation and its individual stockholders and the principle that they are distinct and separate entities. The Supreme Courtâ€™s decision emphasized the separate legal identities of EYCO and Yutingcos.
