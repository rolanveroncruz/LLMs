## Legal Document Summary: Silkair (Singapore) Pte, Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue

**Case:** Silkair (Singapore) Pte, Ltd. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 173594, February 6, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc decision dismissing Silkair's petition for review of a CTA Second Division decision denying its claim for refund of excise taxes paid on jet fuel purchases.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Tax Refund Claim:** Silkair seeks a refund of excise taxes paid on jet fuel purchased from Petron Corporation between January and June 2000.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The Supreme Court (SC) addresses whether Silkair's Petition for Review before the CTA En Banc was timely filed.
*   **Proper Party for Refund:** The core issue is whether Silkair is the proper party to claim the excise tax refund, or whether Petron Corporation, as the manufacturer/producer of the jet fuel, is the only party with standing.
*   **Indirect Tax Exemption:** Silkair argues it is exempt from excise taxes based on Section 135(b) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 and Article 4(2) of the Air Transport Agreement between the Philippines (RP) and Singapore, claiming exemption from "all taxes" similar to the argument made by the National Power Corporation in *Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr.*

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Untimely Appeal:** The SC upheld the CTA En Banc's dismissal, finding the Petition for Review was filed out of time. Notice to Silkair's counsel of record, Jimenez Gonzales Liwanag Bello Valdez Caluya & Fernandez Law Offices (JGLaw), on October 3, 2005, was deemed notice to Silkair, even though Silkair argued it had terminated JGLaw and engaged the Bengzon Law Firm before then. The SC stressed that the law firm was the counsel of record until its offical withdrawal in court.
*   **Proper Party:** The SC affirmed the CTA's ruling that Petron Corporation, as the statutory taxpayer and the party who paid the excise tax, is the proper party to claim the refund, citing Section 130(A)(2) of the NIRC. Even if the tax burden was shifted to Silkair, the added amount became part of the purchase price, not a tax itself.
*   **No Indirect Tax Exemption:** The Court rejected Silkair's "all taxes" argument, distinguishing *Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr.*, and citing *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.* The SC held that Section 135(b) and Article 4(2) do not explicitly exempt Silkair from indirect taxes. Tax exemptions are construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 130(A)(2), 135(b) of the NIRC of 1997
*   Article 4(2) of the Air Transport Agreement between RP and Singapore
*   Section 26, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court

**Case Law:**

*   Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Victorias Milling Co., Inc., et al.
*   Damasco vs. Arrieta
*   Dolores De Mesa Abad v. Court of Appeals
*   Maceda v. Macaraig, Jr.
*   Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Notice to Counsel of Record:** Strict adherence to the Rules of Court regarding withdrawal and substitution of counsel is crucial. Failure to properly withdraw as counsel can result in adverse consequences, like the untimely filing of this claim.
*   **Indirect vs. Direct Tax:** The distinction between direct and indirect taxes and the interpretation of tax exemption clauses remains a potential area of dispute. Clear legislative intent is required to exempt entities from indirect taxes.
*   **Shifting of Tax Burden:** While the burden of tax can be shifted, the statutory taxpayer remains the proper party for claiming refunds, unless specifically provided otherwise.
