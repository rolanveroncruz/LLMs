## Legal Document Summary: Jose v. Suarez, G.R. No. 176795 (2008)

**Nature:** Supreme Court decision on a petition challenging the CA's affirmation of an RTC order enjoining MTCC criminal proceedings for B.P. Blg. 22 violations.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Background:** Spouses Suarez (Respondents) borrowed money from Spouses Jose (Petitioners) at a high daily interest rate. Suarez issued postdated checks to Jose. When the checks bounced, Jose filed B.P. Blg. 22 cases. Suarez then filed a civil case seeking nullification of the interest and the checks.
*   **Issue:** Does the pending civil case for nullification of interest and the checks constitute a prejudicial question warranting the suspension of the B.P. Blg. 22 criminal proceedings?
*   **Ruling:** No. The Supreme Court (SC) held that the validity of the interest rate or the checks is *not* determinative of guilt under B.P. Blg. 22. The act of issuing a bouncing check is *malum prohibitum*.  The SC found the RTC and CA in error.
*   **B.P. Blg. 22:** Emphasizes the stability of checks in commerce and punishes the issuance of a worthless check regardless of the underlying transaction.
*   **Forum Shopping:** SC found Suarez guilty of forum shopping. They first tried to suspend the criminal proceedings in the MTCC, and when that failed, they filed for a preliminary injunction in the RTC based on the same grounds.
*   **Prejudicial Question (Failure):** No prejudicial question exists. The validity of the interest rate does not negate the issuance of a bouncing check.
* **Art. 1956 of the Civil Code:** No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Purita Suarez:** Liable for violating B.P. Blg. 22 if the elements of the offense are proven, regardless of the underlying debt's validity or interest rate.
*   **Carolina & Reynaldo Jose:** Potentially liable for usurious interest, subject to the outcome of the civil case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Usury:**  The 5% daily interest rate is highly suspect and could be declared *contra bonos mores* in the civil case (citing *Medel v. CA*).  However, this will not affect the B.P. 22 violation. Art. 1956 states, "No interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing."
*   **Forum Shopping:** The SC's finding of forum shopping by Suarez could impact her credibility in the civil case.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Meriz v. People:**  Establishes B.P. Blg. 22 as *malum prohibitum*, focusing on the act of issuing a bad check.
*   **Abarquez v. Court of Appeals, Ong v. People, Caras v. CA:** reiterate that the purpose of the check is inconsequential in determining B.P. Blg. 22 culpability.
*   **Medel v. CA:**  Nullified an interest rate of 5.5% per month as iniquitous and contrary to morals. (Used by Respondent, but not pertinent to this case.)
*   **Danao v. Court of Appeals:** (Used by Respondent, but not pertinent to this case.)

**Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (B.P. Blg. 22):**  The central law regarding bouncing checks.
*   **Civil Code:**  Specifically cited are Article 1956 (interest must be stipulated in writing) and Article 1422 (contract from illegal contract is void).
*   **Rules on Criminal Procedure, Sec. 6, Rule 111:** Provides that a petition to suspend proceedings on the ground of prejudicial question should be filed in the same criminal action.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document describes an oral agreement to pay interest. There's no documentation. Thus, there could be an appeal for the repayment of all interest paid under Art. 1956 of the Civil Code.
