**Case Summary: *Tamano v. Ortiz*, G.R. No. 126603 (June 29, 1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' affirmance of the RTC's denial of a motion to dismiss a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage based on bigamy and lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Facts:**

*   Senator Tamano married Zorayda in civil rites.
*   Subsequently, Tamano married Estrellita in civil rites while his marriage to Zorayda was allegedly subsisting.
*   Zorayda and her son, Adib, filed a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage against Estrellita, alleging bigamy because Tamano was still married to Zorayda, and Estrellita misrepresented herself as single.
*   Estrellita moved to dismiss, arguing lack of jurisdiction in the RTC (Quezon City), claiming Shari'a courts have exclusive jurisdiction since Tamano and Zorayda are Muslims and the parties allegedly also married in Muslim rites. Estrellita argued only a party to the marriage could bring the action (i.e., Tamano).

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Jurisdiction (Main Issue):**
    *   Estrellita argued that the Shari'a court has exclusive jurisdiction under Art. 155 of the Code of Muslim Personal Laws (PD 1083), especially in places where there are Shari'a courts. She cited Art. 13, PD 1083, arguing it covers marriages between Muslims or where the male party is Muslim and the marriage is solemnized under Muslim law.
    *   Zorayda argued that since she filed in Quezon City, where no Shari'a court exists, the RTC has jurisdiction.
    *   The court resolved that the RTC has jurisdiction because the Complaint alleged a civil marriage between Tamano and Estrellita. Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint. The court stated the defendant cannot determine jurisdiction by raising the defense that they were married in Muslim rites.
    *   The court also pointed out that Section 19 of BP Blg. 129 provides the RTCs exercise original jurisdiction: (6) In all cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
*   **Standing:**
    *   Estrellita also argued that only Tamano could bring an action for annulment against her. However, because the proceeding was to declare the nullity of the subsequent marriage due to its being bigamous, this argument was not persuasive.
*   **Applicable Law:** The court held that where the complaint alleges marriage according to the Civil Code, the Civil Code applies, regardless of any subsequent claim of a separate Muslim marriage.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the CA decision, ruling that the RTC of Quezon City has jurisdiction over the case because the complaint alleged a civil marriage. It also stated that jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint, not by the defenses raised by the defendant.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Rites:** The decision doesn't fully address the legal effect of *simultaneous* valid marriages under both civil and Muslim laws. If both marriages are valid, the legal ramifications regarding spousal rights, inheritance, and legitimacy of children become complex and were not decided by this case. The court does not delve into which law would apply to these rights.
*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** If the RTC decision declares the second marriage void, the issue of bigamy will be settled. However, this ruling would potentially impact any subsequent proceedings in a Shari'a court relating to the same marital relationship, and that possibility and how it would be resolved is not discussed.
*   **Ambiguity in Application of PD 1083:** The Court did not provide a clear interpretation of how PD 1083 applies when parties contract marriage under both Civil and Muslim rites. This could lead to future disputes in similar scenarios.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **BP Blg. 129, Sec. 19:** Jurisdiction of Regional Trial Courts
*   **PD No. 1083 (Code of Muslim Personal Laws), Arts. 13 and 155:** Applicability of Muslim law and jurisdiction of Shari'a courts.
