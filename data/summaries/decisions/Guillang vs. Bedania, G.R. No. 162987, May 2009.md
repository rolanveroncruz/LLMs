## Legal Document Summary - *Guillang vs. Bedania & De Silva*, G.R. No. 162987

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision in a quasi-delict case stemming from a vehicular accident.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Sofia M. Guillang (represented by heirs), Genaro Guillang, Jose Dignadice, and Alvin Llanillo (Victims)
*   **Respondents:** Rodolfo Bedania (Truck Driver) and Rodolfo de Silva (Truck Owner)

**Facts:**

A collision occurred between Genaro Guillang's car and Rodolfo Bedania's truck (owned by Rodolfo de Silva) on Emilio Aguinaldo Highway. Bedania was executing a U-turn.  Antero Guillang, a passenger in the car, died from injuries sustained in the accident. The RTC found Bedania negligent, and de Silva vicariously liable. The CA reversed this decision, finding Genaro Guillang negligent.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code (Quasi-Delict):** Establishes liability for damages caused by fault or negligence.
*   **Article 2180, Civil Code (Vicarious Liability):** Employers are liable for the tortious acts of their employees acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, unless they can prove due diligence in selection and supervision.
*   **Article 2185, Civil Code (Presumption of Negligence):** A driver violating traffic regulations at the time of an accident is presumed negligent.
*   **Sections 45(b), 48, and 54 of Republic Act No. 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code):** Address turning at intersections, reckless driving, and obstruction of traffic, respectively.
*   **Section 55 of Republic Act No. 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code):** Duty of driver in case of accident.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Rodolfo Bedania (Truck Driver):** Liable for damages due to negligence in executing a U-turn without signaling and in violating traffic regulations.
*   **Rodolfo de Silva (Truck Owner):** Vicariously liable for Bedania's negligence under Article 2180 of the Civil Code, as he failed to prove due diligence in the selection and supervision of his driver.

**Damages Awarded (Ordered by Supreme Court, modifying RTC decision):**

*   **Heirs of Antero Guillang:** P50,000 civil indemnity for death, P50,000 moral damages, P135,000 funeral and burial expenses, P27,000.98 hospitalization expenses.
*   **Genaro Guillang:** P508,566.03 for car repair, P300 hospitalization expenses, P30,000 moral damages.
*   **Jose Dignadice:** P5,436.77 hospitalization expenses, P30,000 moral damages.
*   **Alvin Llanillo:** P10,881.60 hospitalization expenses, P30,000 moral damages.
*   All plaintiffs: P50,000 exemplary damages, P100,000 attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The core dispute revolves around the sequence of events leading to the collision and the determination of which party was negligent. The CA and RTC disagreed on the interpretation of the evidence, particularly the police report and witness testimonies.
*   **Causation:** Establishing proximate cause is crucial.  Respondents could argue that Genaro Guillang's alleged speed or inattention were intervening causes, breaking the chain of causation between Bedania's negligence and the resulting damages.
*   **Due Diligence Defense:** De Silva attempted to avoid vicarious liability by claiming due diligence in the selection and supervision of Bedania. The court found this defense unproven.
* **Inconsistent Testimony:** Discrepancies and contradictions in the police traffic investigator's testimony weakened his credibility.
**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*    *Picart v. Smith,* (37 Phil. 809 (1918))
*   *Thermochem Incorporated v. Naval,* (397 Phil. 934 (2000))
*   *Lambert v. Heirs of Castillon* (G.R. No. 160709, 23 February 2005, 452 SCRA 285)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Intersection:** Dispute existed over whether the accident occurred at an intersection. The court found that there wasn't an intersection.
**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision and reinstated the RTC decision with modifications.  The SC found that the CA erred in its factual findings and that Bedania's negligence (making a sudden U-turn without signaling) was the proximate cause of the accident.  The SC affirmed the vicarious liability of de Silva due to his failure to prove due diligence. The SC modified the damages awarded.

**In Conclusion**

This case highlights the importance of proper execution of U-turns, adherence to traffic regulations, and the vicarious liability of employers for the negligence of their employees. The Supreme Court's decision underscores the weight given to the presumption of negligence under Article 2185 of the Civil Code when a traffic violation occurs.
