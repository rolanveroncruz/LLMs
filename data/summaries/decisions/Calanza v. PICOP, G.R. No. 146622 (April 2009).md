**Legal Document Summary: Calanza v. PICOP, G.R. No. 146622**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) injunction against PICOP preventing petitioners from entering a disputed mining site.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Boundary Dispute:** The core issue is the location of the mining site (Barangay Catihan/Pagtilaan) and whether it falls within Davao Oriental or Surigao del Sur. The CA correctly held that the RTC lacked jurisdiction to resolve the boundary dispute *ab initio*, as primary jurisdiction lies with the *sangguniang panlalawigans* of the respective provinces per Section 118 of the Local Government Code (RA 7160) and Article 17 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991. The RTC can only exercise *appellate* jurisdiction after the *sangguniang panlalawigans* render a decision. This aligns with established case law that a court lacking jurisdiction renders a null and void judgment, attackable at any time (e.g., *Leonor v. Court of Appeals*).

*   **Validity of Mining Permits:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding that the mining permits issued to Petitioners by the Governor of Davao Oriental were invalid. The approval of small-scale mining permits, as of August 23, 1991 (when the applications were filed), was the responsibility of the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board pursuant to the People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 (RA 7076), which took effect on July 18, 1991. The governor had no authority.

*   **PICOP's Rights:** PICOP argued it had exclusive rights to the area by way of Timber License Agreements (TLAs). While the Supreme Court didn't directly address this, the invalidity of the permits effectively prevents petitioners from asserting rights against PICOP.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Have no legal right to conduct mining operations under the invalid permits.
*   **Respondents:** Had no liability for preventing the Petitioners from entering the area given the lack of valid mining permits and the lack of RTC jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Overlapping Jurisdictions:** The case highlights potential conflicts between local government authority (issuing permits) and national policies (TLA rights).
*   **Ambiguity:** The exact location of the mining site remains a contentious issue, even though the procedural issue of jurisdiction over the boundary dispute was the deciding factor.
*   **TLA conflict:** It seems PICOP's rights under the TLA were not examined thoroughly and there is a possibility that the Petitioners could attempt to question the TLA at a later point.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Sections 118 & 119 concerning boundary dispute resolution. Article 15 and 17 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing The Local Government Code of 1991.
*   **Republic Act No. 7076 (People's Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991):** Section 9 concerning the jurisdiction of the Provincial/City Mining Regulatory Board.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1899**
*   **Leonor v. Court of Appeals, 326 Phil. 74 (1996):**  Doctrine of nullity for judgments by courts lacking jurisdiction.
*   **Arevalo v. Benedicto, 157 Phil. 175 (1974):** Reinforces that a void judgment creates no rights or obligations.
*   **Hilado v. Chavez, G.R. No. 134742, 22 September 2004, 438 SCRA 623**

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court correctly denied the petition based on the lack of jurisdiction of the RTC to resolve the boundary dispute *ab initio* and the invalidity of the mining permits. The case emphasizes the importance of proper venue and adherence to statutory procedures.
