**Legal Document Summary: MWSS vs. Quezon City**

**Case:** *Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System vs. The Local Government of Quezon City* (G.R. No. 194388, November 7, 2018)

**Issue:** Whether Quezon City can levy real property taxes (RPT) on properties owned by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that MWSS, as a government instrumentality exercising corporate powers (GICP) or government corporate entity (GCE), is **exempt** from real property taxes, unless beneficial use of its properties has been extended to a taxable person.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's (MWSS) Argument:**
    *   Government instrumentality under Section 133(o) of the Local Government Code (LGC).
    *   RA 6234, Sec 18 (as amended by PD 425) expressly exempts MWSS from RPT (initially).
    *   Properties are held in trust for the Republic and intended for public use.
    *   Relies on *MIAA v. CA* (528 Phil. 181 (2006)) and *PFDA v. CBAA* (560 Phil. 738 (2007)) characterizing it as a government instrumentality, not a GOCC.
    *   Executive Order No. 596 and Republic Act No. 10149 (GOCC Governance Act of 2011) explicitly lists MWSS as a GICP, like MIAA and PFDA.

*   **Respondent's (Quezon City) Argument:**
    *   MWSS holds properties in a proprietary capacity, making them taxable.
    *   Tax exemption under RA 6234 was repealed by Section 234 of the LGC.
    *   MWSS acknowledged tax liabilities through partial payments.

**SC Analysis & Holding:**

*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** SC acknowledged the principle but upheld the CA's decision to hear the case as it involved a pure question of law.
*   **Government Instrumentality vs. GOCC:** Applying *MIAA v. CA* parameters, the SC found that while MWSS exercises corporate powers, it's not a GOCC because:
    *   Its capital is not divided into shares.
    *   Its property is held in trust for the Republic.
    *   The Executive and Legislative branches classify it as a GICP.

*   **Tax Exemption:**  As a government instrumentality, MWSS's RPT exemption under RA 6234 remains valid. Section 234 of the LGC withdraws exemptions only for government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs).
*   **Exception:**  If MWSS extends the "beneficial use" of its properties "for consideration or otherwise" to a "taxable person", those portions become taxable.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Local Government of Quezon City bears the burden to allege and prove beneficial use of the properties has been granted to a taxable person.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6234** (MWSS Charter)
*   **PD 425** (Amending MWSS Charter to Authorize Capital Stock)
*   **Local Government Code (LGC), Sections 133(o) & 234** (Taxing Powers and Exemptions)
*   **Administrative Code, Sections 2(10) & 2(13)** (Definitions of "Instrumentality" & "GOCC")

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Beneficial Use" Definition:**  The legal meaning of "beneficial use" granted to a "taxable person" could be a future point of contention.  Are concession agreements equivalent to granting "beneficial use?"
*   **Factual Disputes:**  The Court's decision hinges on whether *any* portion of MWSS properties are leased to taxable persons. This invites factual disputes and future litigation.
*   **Enforcement:** The SC declared the tax assessments void but reserved the right of Quezon City to assess taxes on portions leased to private parties. This necessitates clear delineation of leased areas and their lessees.

**Conclusion:**

The SC favored MWSS, establishing its tax-exempt status as a government instrumentality. However, Quezon City retains the ability to tax portions of MWSS property leased to private entities, potentially leading to future conflicts over the interpretation of "beneficial use" and factual determinations of lease agreements.
