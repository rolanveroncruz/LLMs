**Legal Document Summary: A.C. No. 12062**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Raymund P. Guzman for violation of Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), lawyer's oath, and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Notarization of Deed:** Atty. Guzman notarized a Deed of Self Adjudication with Sale executed by Jose Unite Torrices, who claimed to be the sole heir of Herminigildo A. Unite. Florentino S. Unite, the actual heir of Herminigildo, filed the complaint.
*   **Identification Issue:** Atty. Guzman accepted Torrices's Community Tax Certificate (CTC) as sufficient identification for notarization.
*   **Complainant's Argument:** CTC is not competent evidence of identity under the Notarial Rules as amended by A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC. Deed was thus recorded in the Registry of Deeds, resulting in the cancellation of the complainant's father's title and issuance of a new one to the buyer, Francisco U. Tamayo.

**Obligations:**

*   **Notary Public's Duty of Verification:**  Atty. Guzman had an obligation to verify the identity of the signatory (Torrices) using "competent evidence of identity" as defined in Section 12, Rule II of the Notarial Rules.
*   **Compliance with CPR Canon 1 Rule 1.01:** A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Violation of Notarial Rules:** Failure to properly identify Torrices constituted a violation of the Notarial Rules.
*   **Violation of CPR:** Act considered unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct under Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the CPR.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense of Personal Knowledge:** Atty. Guzman claimed he knew the affiant, which the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) initially found sufficient to excuse strict compliance. The Supreme Court rejected this, noting the Deed lacked an explicit statement of personal knowledge and that "personally known" requires pre-existing knowledge, not mere representation during notarization.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:** Respondent's claim to have requested other current government IDs at the time of notarization but the Deed itself contradicted such claim.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Section 12 & Rule IV, Section 2(b):** Defines "competent evidence of identity" and outlines requirements for notarization. Specifically highlights the need for "at least one current identification document issued by an official agency bearing the photograph and signature of the individual".
*   **A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC:** Amendment to the Notarial Rules further clarifying competent evidence of identity.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 1, Rule 1.01:** Prohibits lawyers from engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Gaddi v. Velasco, 742 Phil. 810, 815 (2014):** Re-iterated the principle that notarization converts a private document to a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity.

**Ruling:**

*   Atty. Guzman found guilty of violating the Notarial Rules and the CPR.
*   **Penalty:**
    *   Suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months.
    *   Revocation of incumbent notarial commission (if any).
    *   Disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public for two (2) years.
    *   Warning against repetition of similar offenses.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the IBP's findings with modifications, emphasizing the importance of a notary public's duty to verify identity. The SC rejected the argument that personal knowledge, absent a clear statement in the Deed, could excuse the requirement of competent identification. The ruling highlights the seriousness with which the SC views breaches of the Notarial Rules and the CPR, particularly when they undermine the integrity of the notarial process. The SC also considered jurisprudence on "competent evidence of identity," reiterating that a CTC is insufficient.
