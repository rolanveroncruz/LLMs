Okay, here's a summary of the document, designed to be concise and legally precise for a lawyer:

**Case Name:**  *Congressman Hermilando I. Mandanas, et al. v. Executive Secretary Paquito N. Ochoa, Jr., et al.* (G.R. No. 199802) and *Honorable Enrique T. Garcia, Jr. v. Honorable [Paquito] N. Ochoa, Jr., et al.* (G.R. No. 208488), 835 Phil. 97 (2018)

**Summary:**

These consolidated cases involve challenges to the computation of the "just share" of Local Government Units (LGUs) in national taxes under Section 6, Article X of the 1987 Constitution and Section 284 of the Local Government Code (LGC), R.A. No. 7160.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 6, Article X, 1987 Constitution:** Mandates LGUs to have a "just share, as determined by law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released to them."
*   **Section 284, LGC:**  Provides for a share in "national internal revenue taxes" (NIRTs) based on collections of the third preceding fiscal year. Petitioners argue this is unconstitutional, asserting that the correct base should be *all* national taxes.
*   **Section 12(A), NIRC:** States that Customs Commissioner acts as an agent of the BIR with respect to collecting national internal revenue taxes on imported goods

**Issues:**

*   Whether *mandamus* is a proper remedy. Held: No, but treated as certiorari due to grave abuse of discretion allegation.
*   Whether Section 284 of the LGC unconstitutionally limits the base for the LGUs' share. Held: Yes, the phrase "internal revenue" is unconstitutional.
*   Whether certain exclusions from the NIRT base are valid. Held: Partially valid, depending on the specific tax and the constitutional basis for exclusion.
*   Whether petitioners are entitled to arrears. Held: No, application of the operative fact doctrine limits the ruling to prospective effect.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court PARTIALLY GRANTS the petitions. It declares the phrase "internal revenue" in Section 284 of the LGC UNCONSTITUTIONAL. The Court ORDERS the inclusion of ALL COLLECTIONS OF NATIONAL TAXES in the computation of the base of the just share of the Local Government Units according to the ratio provided in the now-modified Section 284 of Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code) except those accruing to special purpose funds and special allotments for the utilization and development of the national wealth.The claims of the Local Government Units for the settlement by the National Government of arrears in the just share on the ground that this decision shall have PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Respondents (DOF, DBM, BIR, BOC, National Treasurer) are obligated to include *all* national tax collections in the base for computing the LGUs' "just share," including those collected by the BOC.
*   Automatic release of just shares to LGUs on a quarterly basis is commanded.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Special Purpose Funds":**  The ruling excludes "special purpose funds," but this term is not explicitly defined, potentially leading to future disputes regarding which funds qualify. 
*   **Enforcement Challenges:** Ensuring the BOC properly reports and transfers all national tax collections to the BIR for IRA computation may require enhanced oversight and auditing.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Dillon's Rule:** Addresses the limited powers of municipal corporations.
*   *Magtajas v. Pryce Properties Corporation, Inc.*
*   *ACORD v. Zamora*, GR No. 144256 (2005) - Highlights the constitutional infirmity of conditioning IRA releases.
*   *Republic v. COCOFED,* G.R. No. 147062-64 - Defines the elements of a tax.
*   *Garcia v. Executive Secretary*, G.R. No. 101273 (1992) - Discusses the nature of customs duties as taxes.
*   *CIVIL CODE, Art. 7; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation* -Addresses the operative fact doctrine, as well as the test for applicability.
*   NIRC, sec. 21, which defines national internal revenue taxes, particularly VAT, Excise taxes, and DST.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contentious clause is Section 284 of the LGC. The phrase "internal revenue" is declared unconstitutional and is struck down from the text. The phrase "internal revenue" is likewise hereby DELETED from the related sections of Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code), specifically Section 285, Section 287, and Section 290, which provisions shall henceforth read as follows:

**Overall Assessment:**

This decision significantly expands the base for computing the LGUs' "just share" of national taxes, potentially increasing their financial resources. However, the lack of precise definitions regarding excluded funds and the prospective application limit the immediate practical impact. This ruling will likely prompt legislative action to address the funding implications and could lead to further litigation regarding the definition of "special purpose funds."
