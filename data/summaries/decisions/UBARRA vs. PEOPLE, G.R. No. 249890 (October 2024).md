## Legal Document Summary: Ubarra v. People (G.R. No. 249890)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision regarding a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision to set aside a Regional Trial Court (RTC) acquittal in a perjury case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA violated the Petitioner's (Ubarra) right against double jeopardy when it reversed the RTC's judgment of acquittal and remanded the case for further proceedings.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied Ubarra's petition, affirming the CA's decision. The Court held that the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion, violating the State's right to due process, thereby rendering the acquittal void.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Perjury Charge:** Ubarra was charged with perjury for allegedly making untruthful statements under oath in a verified complaint-affidavit filed before the Office of the Ombudsman against Atty. Casanova.
*   **Due Process for the State:** The Decision emphasizes that both the accused *and* the State have a constitutional right to due process in criminal proceedings.
*   **Double Jeopardy Exception:** The Court reiterates the exception to the double jeopardy rule: it does not apply when the initial acquittal was obtained through grave abuse of discretion by the trial court, resulting in a denial of the State's right to due process.
*   **Duty of the RTC:** The RTC was directed to resolve the criminal case with utmost dispatch, after the Supreme Court determined grave abuse of discretion by the initial RTC judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Ubarra:** Remains liable for the charge of perjury. The case is remanded to the RTC for a proper determination of guilt.
*   **Attorneys (Custodio Acorda Sicam De Castro & Panganiban Law Offices):** While the initial RTC ruling ordered the attorneys to explain their statement regarding the filing of judicial affidavit, this was effectively superseded by the CA and Supreme Court decisions.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion Standard:** The determination of "grave abuse of discretion" is a fact-specific inquiry. The RTC's error, as determined by the appellate courts, hinged on disregarding evidence available and failing to allow the prosecution to explain the missing judicial affidavit, coupled with the perceived error in acquitting based on courtroom identification.
*   **Missing Judicial Affidavit:** The central issue revolved around the RTC's failure to account for Atty. Casanova's judicial affidavit, which was allegedly filed with the MeTC but was absent from the records transmitted to the RTC. This created a risk of incomplete and potentially prejudicial evaluation of evidence.
*   **Ambiguity in Identification:** The Supreme Court found fault with the RTC's requirement of in-court identification despite Ubarra's own admission of executing the affidavit in question. This point emphasizes the need for thorough analysis of the elements of perjury.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 21:** Guarantees against double jeopardy.
*   **Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Perjury.
*   **Republic Act No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
*   **Republic Act No. 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees

*   **Saldana v. Court of Appeals (268 Phil. 424 (1990)):** Premature termination of evidence by the trial court.
*   **Portugal v. Reantaso (249 Phil. 671 (1988)):** Lack of notice deprived the state of the opportunity to present evidence.
*   **People v. Pablo (187 Phil. 190 (1980)):** Grave abuse of discretion in ordering a dismissal.
*   **People v. Pimentel (823 Phil. 684, 694 (2018)):** Court's cannot change a judgment of acquittal.
*   **Argel v. Judge Pascua (415 Phil. 608 (2001)):** Judgement of acquittal is not appealable.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the importance of due process for both the accused *and* the State in criminal proceedings. It serves as a reminder that an acquittal can be overturned if the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion that deprived the State of a fair opportunity to present its case. The core of the matter rests on the proper handling and consideration of evidence, especially when a key piece of evidence goes missing, and on the proper application of the identification requirements for establishing a case. This decision clarifies the narrow exception to double jeopardy and serves as a warning against procedural errors that can prejudice the State's right to a fair trial.
