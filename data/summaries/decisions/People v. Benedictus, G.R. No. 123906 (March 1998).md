**Case Summary: *People v. Benedictus*, G.R. No. 123906 (1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for illegal recruitment in large scale under Article 38, in relation to Articles 34 and 39, of the Labor Code.

**Facts:** Accused-Appellant Rowena Hermoso Benedictus was convicted of illegally recruiting five complainants (Napoleon dela Cruz, Crisanta Vasquez, Evelyn de Dios, Mercy Magpayo, and Evangeline Magpayo) for overseas employment in Taiwan.  The prosecution presented evidence that the appellant, without a license or authority from the POEA, promised the complainants jobs in Taiwan, collected fees (placement, processing, passport), and failed to deploy them as promised.  The prosecution presented a POEA certification confirming the lack of a license and the complainants. The defense argued they only borrowed money.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Art. 38, Labor Code):** The court defined illegal recruitment as any recruitment activity undertaken by non-licensees or non-holders of authority (Art. 38(a)).  It also covered any prohibited practices under Art. 34.
*   **Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale (Art. 38(b)):** The court confirmed that illegal recruitment is deemed in large scale if committed against three or more persons individually or as a group. Under Article 39, it constitutes economic sabotage, punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.
*   **Definition of "Recruitment and Placement" (Art. 13(b), Labor Code):** The Court reiterates the definition of "recruitment and placement" as encompassing any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, including referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not; importantly, it is considered recruitment and placement when two or more persons is promised a paid employment.
*   **POEA Certification:** The POEA certification, stating that the appellant was not licensed to recruit, was considered prima facie evidence of that fact, citing Section 23 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. The court pointed out that the appellant admitted this fact in open court.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The Affidavit of Desistance executed by the complainants was given little weight because it was executed *after* they testified and received payment from the appellant. The court also noted that the affidavit did not expressly repudiate their testimony about recruitment activities. Citing *Castillo v. Calanog*, 199 SCRA 75, 81 [1991] and *People v. Ballabare*, 264 SCRA 350, 363 [1996], the Court disavowed the Affidavit.
*   **Credibility:** The trial courtâ€™s assessment of the witnesses' credibility was upheld.
*   **Evidentiary Matters:**  The prosecution adequately established that the appellant promised jobs, collected fees, and lacked the necessary license.

**Obligations:**

*   The appellant had a legal obligation to obtain the proper license/authority from the POEA before engaging in recruitment activities.
*   The appellant had the obligation to deploy the complainants to Taiwan as promised, failing which, to return the fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for illegal recruitment in large scale, resulting in the sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Complainant Testimony:** The conviction hinges heavily on the testimony of the complainants. Any successful challenge to their credibility could weaken the case. However, the Affidavit of Desistance was presented only after the case began, indicating a lack of trustworthiness.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The defense failed to adequately rebut the prosecution's evidence, including the POEA certification.
*   **Economic Sabotage Designation:** While the large-scale nature of the recruitment triggers the "economic sabotage" designation, the evidence did not show broader economic disruption beyond the individual harm to the complainants.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Payment amounts to specific complainant:** The court accepts the complainants word as to the amount that they each paid Benedictus. The amounts were listed, but there was no official receipt.
*   **Definition of "Recruitment and Placement:"** The Court reiterated the definition of recruitment and placement that it stated in Art. 13(b). But the proviso "any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement," lacks specificity as the term "fee" can be vague.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 13(b), 34, 38, and 39:** These articles form the core of the legal framework for illegal recruitment and the associated penalties.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 132, Section 23:** Addresses the probative value of public documents.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2034** Addresses the validity of compromises in settling civil liabilities vs. the separate nature of criminal liability.
*   ***Castillo v. Calanog, 199 SCRA 75, 81 [1991]; People v. Ballabare, 264 SCRA 350, 363 [1996]***: Established precedent for dismissing Affidavits of Desistance.
*   ***People v. Mangulabnan, 200 SCRA 611, 623 [1991]; People v. Romero, 224 SCRA 749, 757 [1993]; People v. Agbayani, G.R. No. 122770, 16 January 1998***: Additional precedents to consider for similar fact patterns.
*   ***People v. Comia, 236 SCRA 185, 193 [1994]; People v. Benemerito, 264 SCRA 677, 691-692 [1996]; People v. Buemio, 265 SCRA 582, 597 [1996]***: Cited for the definition of illegal recruitment in large scale.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed the conviction based on the evidence presented, which established the elements of illegal recruitment in large scale beyond a reasonable doubt. The Affidavit of Desistance was deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction, and the POEA certification was accepted as prima facie evidence.
