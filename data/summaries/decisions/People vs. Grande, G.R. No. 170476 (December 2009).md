**Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines vs. Ricardo Grande***

**Case:** G.R. No. 170476, December 23, 2009

**Court:** First Division, Supreme Court (affirming CA's affirmation of RTC)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of Rape conviction

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant Ricardo Grande was charged with rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (pre-RA 8353, the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, effective Oct 22, 1997, after the commission of this crime).
*   The victim, AAA, was a 15-year-old minor at the time of the incident (August 21, 1997).
*   The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of AAA, a neighbor, and the medico-legal officer who confirmed a healed hymenal laceration. The defense presented only the accused, asserting a "sweetheart theory."
*   The RTC and CA found the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, rejecting the "sweetheart theory" due to a lack of corroborating evidence (no love letters, photos, or witness testimony).
*   The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings, emphasizing the credibility of AAA's testimony, corroborated by medical evidence.
*   The Supreme Court notes that the trial court is in a better position to judge the credibility of witnesses.
*   Accused admitted to the act of sexual intercourse but stated that it was a consensual act, as they were sweethearts.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused is obligated to pay the victim P50,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P25,000 as exemplary damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Civil liability for damages arising from the crime.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sweetheart Theory:** The defense's reliance on the "sweetheart theory" was deemed unconvincing due to the lack of corroborating evidence. Such a defense is often rejected unless substantiated.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** While dwelling was proven, the SC found that the prosecution failed to prove the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity. Note, that the CA failed to award exemplary damages in this case.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The case hinged heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony. The appellate courts deferred to the trial court's assessment of credibility.
*   **Minor Victim:** The victim's status as a minor strengthens the prosecution's case, making consent a non-issue due to the child's lack of legal capacity to consent.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** A challenge based on double jeopardy would likely fail since the case involved a direct appeal after conviction.
