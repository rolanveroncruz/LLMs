**Case Summary: B. D. Long Span Builders, Inc. v. R. S. Ampeloquio Realty Development, Inc., G.R. No. 169919, September 11, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC decision, which declared contracts rescinded and awarded damages due to respondent's failure to fulfill contractual obligations.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that there was invalid service of summons upon respondent, thereby depriving the trial court of jurisdiction.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner and Respondent entered into two agreements for construction services ("rip rapping") totaling P80 million.
*   Petitioner deposited an P800,000 cash bond.
*   Respondent allegedly failed to fulfill obligations, leading to project cancellation.
*   Petitioner sued for rescission and damages after respondent refused to return the cash bond.
*   Respondent was declared in default by the RTC after failing to answer the complaint. RTC ruled in favor of the petitioner.
*   CA reversed, holding the trial court lacked jurisdiction due to improper service of summons.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the respondent due to invalid service of summons.  The case was remanded to the RTC for further proceedings upon valid service of summons.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Jurisdiction:**  Citing established jurisprudence, the Court reiterated that jurisdiction over a defendant is acquired via service of summons or voluntary appearance.
*   **Rule 14, Section 11 (Service upon Domestic Private Juridical Entity):** Service must be made on specific officers (President, Managing Partner, General Manager, Corporate Secretary, Treasurer, or In-House Counsel). *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Sps. Santiago, G.R. No. 169116, 28 March 2007.*
*   **Rule 14, Section 7 (Substituted Service):**  Permitted only if personal service is impossible after diligent efforts. Impossibility must be documented. *Ang Ping v. Court of Appeals, 369 Phil. 607 (1999)*.
*   **Invalid Service:** Service was made on a staff member, Romel Dolahoy, without prior attempts at personal service on authorized officers. No showing of a relationship of confidence existed between Dolahoy and the respondent.
*   *   Cites *Orion Security Corporation v. Kalfam Enterprises, Inc., G.R. No. 163287, 27 April 2007* (requiring a relation of confidence for effective substituted service).
*   **Default Remedy:**  The court affirms the options of defaulted parties according to Talsan Enterprises, Inc. v. Baliwag Transit, Inc., 369 Phil. 409, 421 (1999).
*   **Jurisdictional Defect:**  Filing a Notice of Appeal did not cure the jurisdictional defect arising from improper service of summons.

**Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Compliance with Summons Service:**  The case underscores the crucial importance of strict adherence to Rule 14 regarding service of summons, especially for corporations. Failure to comply can lead to a dismissal of the case and re-filing if the statute of limitations has not lapsed.
*   **Ambiguity regarding "Reasonable Time" for Personal Service:** The determination of what constitutes a "reasonable time" to attempt personal service before resorting to substituted service is fact-dependent and can be a point of contention. The Process Server's return should provide detailed documentation of efforts.
*   **Relationship of Confidence in Substituted Service:**  The requirement of a "relation of confidence" for substituted service, as highlighted in *Orion*, adds another layer of complexity. Litigants must present evidence to demonstrate such a relationship exists, something the court found lacking in this case.
**Potential Liabilities and Obligations:**

*   **B. D. Long Span Builders, Inc.:** B. D. Long Span Builders, Inc. would need to ensure proper service on the respondent in the re-filed case, complying strictly with Rule 14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **R. S. Ampeloquio Realty Development, Inc.:**  The company must ensure compliance with any new summons issued by the court and diligently defend against any claims brought by B. D. Long Span Builders, Inc.
