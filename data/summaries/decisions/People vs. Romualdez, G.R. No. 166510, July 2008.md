## Legal Document Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Benjamin "Kokoy" T. Romualdez and the Sandiganbayan (First Division)*, G.R. No. 166510

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the Sandiganbayan's Resolutions granting a motion to quash an Information charging Romualdez with violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).

**Key Issue:** Whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the motion to quash, arguing that the facts alleged in the Information do not constitute an offense.

**Facts Alleged in the Information:** Romualdez, while Governor of Leyte, used his influence as brother-in-law of then President Marcos to get appointed as Ambassador to multiple countries (China, Saudi Arabia, USA) simultaneously without abandoning his position as Governor. This enabled him to collect dual compensation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Provincial Government of Leyte, causing undue injury to the government.

**Sandiganbayan's Reasoning for Quashing:** The SB reasoned that the information didn't prove accused did not render service for the two concurrent positions. Receiving Compensation for actual service rendered, it said, doesn't equate to improper/illegal use of funds nor cause unjust enrichment tantamount to damage and prejudice of the government. The SB also held that Romualdez could not be criminally liable for merely entering into the appointment for the appointment is something that can only be imputed to the appointing authority.

**Supreme Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, annulling the Sandiganbayan's Resolutions.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Prohibits public officers from causing undue injury to the government through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **Motion to Quash (Rule 117, Section 3(a)):** Standard for granting is whether the facts alleged in the information, if hypothetically admitted, would establish the essential elements of the offense. Only requires the stating of ultimate facts.
*   **SC Argument:** The Court held the Sandiganbayan improperly considered evidentiary matters and defenses instead of solely focusing on the allegations within the Information, which sufficiently stated the elements of Section 3(e).
    *   The Sandiganbayan required allegation that the accused did not render service in the two positions. That he could not legally receive compensation for both positions are matters of detail that the prosecution should adduce at the trial to flesh out the ultimate facts alleged in the Information.
    *   The Court points to Article XII(B), Section 4 of the 1973 Constitution and Presidential Decree No. 807 as prohibitions of an elective official's eligibility for appointment to any office or position during their term of office. The 1973 Constitution also prohibits double compensation unless specifically authorized by law.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Potential Criminal Liability for Romualdez:** By ordering the Sandiganbayan to proceed with the trial, Romualdez remains subject to potential criminal liability under RA 3019, Section 3(e).
*   **Reversal of Legal Precedent:** The SC emphasizes the limited circumstances under which a Rule 65 petition can be used to review a Sandiganbayan decision, particularly when an appeal under Rule 45 is the proper remedy.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The SC acknowledges the spirit of liberality that pervades the Rules of Court and the interest of substantial justice, and that the Court has deviated from the strict application of procedural rules. This leaves open the possibility of future cases involving similar circumstances being subject to discretionary treatment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(e)**
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 65 (Certiorari)**
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 45 (Appeal by Certiorari)**
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 117 (Motion to Quash)**
*   **PD 1606, Section 7 (Sandiganbayan jurisdiction and appeals)**
*   **1973 Constitution: Article XII (B), Section 4; Article XV, Section 5**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 807**

*   *Republic v. Sandiganbayan*
*   *People v. Sandiganbayan*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found that the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the motion to quash because the Sandiganbayan considered evidentiary matters that are only appropriate at trial. The Court further found that a violation of Section 3(e), R.A. 3019 involves the causing of undue injury to the government at the core. The court also highlighted the lack of allegations of "giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to any party" appears in the Information. The Sandiganbayan is now ordered to proceed with the trial based on the filed Information.
