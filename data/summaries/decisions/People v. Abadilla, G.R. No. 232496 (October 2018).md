Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided *People v. Abadilla* decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Nestor Abadilla y Vergara*, G.R. No. 232496, October 8, 2018.

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 ("Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002").

**Facts:** Accused-appellant Abadilla was convicted by the RTC and CA for selling two sachets of methamphetamine hydrochloride ("shabu") to a police poseur-buyer (PO2 Ganir) in a buy-bust operation. Abadilla claimed illegal arrest and denial of the charge, but was then confirmed as guilty until the appeal to the Supreme Court.

**Issue:** Whether Abadilla is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.

**Holding:** Accused acquitted based on reasonable doubt due to a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of identity of buyer/seller, object, consideration, delivery, and payment.
*   **Section 21, Article II, R.A. 9165 (as amended by R.A. 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for the seizure and custody of dangerous drugs.
    *   **Pre-Amendment (applicable in this case):** Requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized drugs in the presence of the accused (or representative), a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official. All should sign the inventory.
    *   **Amendment Introduced by R.A. 10640:** Reduces the number of required witnesses to two: an elected public official AND a representative of the National Prosecution Service (DOJ) OR the media.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The prosecution must prove an unbroken chain of custody to establish the *corpus delicti* and obviate doubt about the identity and integrity of the drugs.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:**  The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (Constitution, Article III, Section 14(2)).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction:** If the prosecution proves the elements of Section 5 and adheres to Section 21, the accused faces life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
*   **Exclusion of Evidence:** Failure to comply with Section 21 can lead to the exclusion of the seized drugs as evidence ("fruit of the poisonous tree").
*   **Presumption of Regularity Overcome:** Gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of procedural safeguards negates the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties.
*   **Acquittal:** Failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt mandates acquittal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **R.A. No. 10640 (Amendment to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165)**
*   ***People v. Ismael*** **(G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017):**  Elements of illegal sale.
*   ***People v. Paz*** **(G.R. No. 229512, January 31, 2018):** Chain of custody requirements.
*   ***People v. Agulay*** **(588 Phil. 247 (2008)):** Buy-bust operations.
*   ***People v. Mendoza*** **(736 Phil. 749 (2014)):** Insulating presence of required witnesses.
*   ***People v. Sipin*** **(G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018):** Burden of proving a valid cause for non-compliance with Section 21 lies with the prosecution.
*   ***People v. Umipang*** **(686 Phil. 1024 (2012)):** Effect of procedural lapses on presumption of regularity.
*   ***People v. Hilario*** **(G.R. No. 210610, January 11, 2018):** Prosecution bears the burden to overcome the presumption of innocence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Key Points for Litigation:**

*   **Saving Clause (IRR of R.A. 9165 and R.A. 10640):** The "justifiable grounds" exception for non-compliance with Section 21 is a major point of contention.  The prosecution must convincingly explain the non-compliance *and* prove preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items. The court found the provided reasoning questionable.
*   **Strict adherence when quantity is miniscule:** Where quantity is small, higher scrutiny should be given to drug operations as tampering is more likely. *People v. Sipin*

**Potential Risks**

*   The failure to establish the *corpus delicti* and the failure to follow safeguards outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 would lead to issues with admissibility and credibility of the evidence.
*   The Supreme Court heavily considered the lack of justifiable grounds in the failure to comply with the procedural requirements, indicating a stricter approach to compliance with Section 21.
