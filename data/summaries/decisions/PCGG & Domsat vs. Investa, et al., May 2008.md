## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 135466, May 07, 2008 (Republic v. Investa)

**Case:** Petition for Review of Sandiganbayan Order dismissing Civil Case No. 0182 for lack of jurisdiction.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Republic of the Philippines (represented by PCGG) and Domestic Satellite Philippines, Inc. (Domsat).
*   **Respondents:** Investa Corporation, et al.

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over dilution of the Republic's shareholdings in Domsat due to a Management Contract between Domsat and Investa Corporation. The PCGG sequestered Domsat shares of Benedicto, Africa, and Nieto as part of the Marcos ill-gotten wealth recovery efforts.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Sequestration:** PCGG sequestered Domsat in 1986 pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 1 and 2, aiming to prevent dissipation of assets allegedly part of Marcos' ill-gotten wealth.
*   **Management Contract:** In 1989, Domsat, under a new Board of Directors, entered into a Management Contract with Investa Corporation. Investa was compensated with Domsat shares, diluting the Republic's shareholdings.
*   **Dilution of Shares:** Republic's shareholdings allegedly decreased from 32.79% to 15.998% while Investa's share increased to 75% at the time of the suit.
*   **Sandiganbayan's Ruling:** Dismissed the case, holding it was an intra-corporate dispute within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under PD 902-A, Section 5(a) and (b), not involving ill-gotten wealth directly.

**Issue:** Does the Sandiganbayan have jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 0182?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the Sandiganbayan *does* have jurisdiction.

**Reasoning:**

*   **PCGG Jurisdiction:** Under Executive Order No. 14, the Sandiganbayan has exclusive and original jurisdiction over cases regarding funds, moneys, assets, and properties illegally acquired by Ferdinand Marcos, his family, cronies, etc.
*   **Conservator Role:** PCGG acts as a conservator of sequestered shares, tasked with preventing their dissipation. _Bataan Shipyard & Engineering Co., Inc. v. PCGG_ (150 SCRA 181) establishes the PCGG's role in conserving sequestered assets.
*   **San Miguel Distinction:** _San Miguel Corporation v. Kahn_ (176 SCRA 447) is distinguished.  While *San Miguel* involved an intra-corporate dispute, here the core issue is the dilution of *sequestered* shares that allegedly constitute ill-gotten wealth. The PCGG's questioning of the dilution is tied to its duty to conserve the sequestered property.
*   **Property at issue** The Domsat shares are at the heart of the case, and the case thus is within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.

**Disposition:** The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, *set aside* the Sandiganbayan's Order and Resolution, and *directed* the Sandiganbayan to take cognizance of Civil Case No. 0182.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Sandiganbayan must now rule on the propriety of the management contract and consider issues raised by Investa.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Propriety of Management Contract:** The legality and validity of the Management Contract itself, and whether it was an arms-length transaction.  Investa's role and potential good faith in increasing capital are also factors.
*   **Characterization of Domsat Shares:** Whether the Domsat shares indeed constitute "ill-gotten wealth" subject to PCGG's control.
*   **Valuation:** Valuation of Domsat shares and the extent of dilution will be key.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14, and 14-A (PCGG's powers)
*   PD 902-A, Section 5(a) and (b) (Jurisdiction of the SEC)
*   _Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Pe√±a_, 159 SCRA 556 (Sandiganbayan's jurisdiction over PCGG)
*   _San Miguel Corporation v. Kahn_, 176 SCRA 447 (Intra-corporate disputes)
*   _Bataan Shipyard & Engineering Co., Inc. v. PCGG_, 150 SCRA 181 (PCGG's power to sequester and conserve)
