**Case:** *Review Center Association of the Philippines vs. Executive Secretary Ermita and CHED* (G.R. No. 180046, April 2, 2009)

**Summary:** This case concerns the constitutionality of Executive Order (EO) 566 and Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Memorandum Order No. 30, series of 2007 (Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations - RIRR), which directed the CHED to regulate the establishment and operation of review centers and similar entities in the Philippines. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled EO 566 and the RIRR are unconstitutional.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **EO 566:** Directed the CHED to formulate a framework for regulating review centers, including policies, standards, guidelines, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms. Required CHED indorsement and permits for operation.
*   **RIRR (CMO 30, s. 2007):** Restricted authorization to establish/operate review centers to CHED-recognized Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) or consortia. Required existing review centers to "tie-up" with HEIs, consortia, or PRC-recognized professional associations or convert into schools within a grace period. Penalties for non-compliance included being barred from operating.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **EO 566's Expansion of CHED's Jurisdiction:** RA 7722 (Higher Education Act) limits CHED's coverage to higher education institutions and degree-granting programs. EO 566 and RIRR expand this to include non-degree-granting review centers, tutorial services, etc., exceeding CHED's statutory mandate.
*   **Usurpation of Legislative Power:** The President, via EO 566, effectively amended RA 7722 without legislative authorization. The President does not have the legislative power to unilaterally alter CHED's functions, violating the principle of separation of powers. *Ople v. Torres* (creating national ID system by administrative order without enabling legislation held unconstitutional) is cited.
*   **Improper Delegation of Authority:** The court notes that while the President has control over the executive branch, it cannot transfer powers delegated to a specific agency (PRC) under one law (RA 8981) to a different agency (CHED) via executive order, since delegation is already statutory. 

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7722:** The Higher Education Act of 1994, defining CHED's mandate.
*   **EO 292:** The Administrative Code of 1987; Section 20 discusses residual powers, requiring legislation.
*   **RA 8981:** The Philippine Regulation Commission Modernization Act of 2000; section 5 establishes PRC primary mandate and safeguard the integrity of all licensure examinations
*   **Ople v. Torres:** Relevant for its holding that an administrative order cannot substitute for legislative action.
*   **People v. Cuaresma:** Discusses the principle of hierarchy of courts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Tie-up/be integrated with HEI":** The RIRR's requirement for independent review centers to tie-up with HEIs lacks clear definition, creating uncertainty and potential for arbitrary enforcement. (However, the Court notes CHED defined "tie-up/be integrated" as simply being a partner with an HEI.)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ruled EO 566 and the RIRR are unconstitutional because they: (1) expand the CHED's jurisdiction beyond that defined in RA 7722; (2) constitute an invalid exercise of legislative power by the Executive; and (3) lack a valid delegation of police power. In this case, the Court asserts that the President's powers under EO 292 do not authorize amending existing legislation (RA 7722) through executive order, and an existing law to regulate review centers is R.A. 8981, otherwise known as the PRC Modernization Act of 2000.
