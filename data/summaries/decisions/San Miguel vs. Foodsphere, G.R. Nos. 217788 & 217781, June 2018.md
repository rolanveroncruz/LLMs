**Case Summary: *San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. vs. Foodsphere, Inc.* (G.R. No. 217781 & 217788, June 20, 2018)**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari concerning unfair competition under Section 168 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8293, the Intellectual Property Code (IP Code).

**Parties:**

*   **San Miguel Pure Foods Company, Inc. (SMPFCI):** Owner of the "PUREFOODS FIESTA HAM" trademark and claiming unfair competition.
*   **Foodsphere, Inc.:** Manufacturer of "CDO PISTA HAM," accused of unfair competition.

**Facts:** SMPFCI sued Foodsphere before the Bureau of Legal Affairs (BLA) of the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) for trademark infringement and unfair competition, alleging confusingly similar marks and trade dress. The BLA initially dismissed the complaint. The Director General partially granted SMPFCI's appeal, finding Foodsphere liable for unfair competition but not trademark infringement. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the Director General's finding of unfair competition, awarded nominal damages and attorney's fees but later deleted exemplary damages.

**Issues:**

1.  **(G.R. No. 217781, SMPFCI):** Whether the CA erred in deleting the award of exemplary damages.
2.  **(G.R. No. 217788, Foodsphere):** Whether the CA committed grave abuse of discretion in finding Foodsphere guilty of unfair competition.

**Held:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Unfair Competition (Sec. 168, IP Code):** The SC upheld the finding of unfair competition based on the general appearance of Foodsphere's packaging and inferred intent to deceive, focusing on the shift in packaging style mirroring SMPFCI's, supporting the elements of (1) confusing similarity in the general appearance of the goods; and (2) intent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor. The true test for unfair competition is whether the acts of the defendant have the intent of deceiving or are calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the ordinary conditions of the particular trade to which the controversy relates.
*   **Exemplary Damages (Art. 2233, Civil Code):** The SC affirmed the deletion of exemplary damages because SMPFCI failed to sufficiently prove its entitlement to moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages. Exemplary damages require a showing of bad faith or wanton, fraudulent, oppressive, or malevolent conduct.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Foodsphere:** Liable for nominal damages (P100,000) and attorney's fees (P300,000) for unfair competition.
*   **Foodsphere:** Obligated to cease and desist from using the infringing labels, signs, prints, packages, etc., and seizure/disposal of such materials.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Confusing Similarity":** While the SC emphasized the *overall* similarity of packaging (layout, colors, images), the threshold for what constitutes "confusing similarity" remains fact-specific. This creates some uncertainty for businesses redesigning packaging.
*   **Proof of Damages:** SMPFCI's failure to provide sufficient evidence of lost profits/sales highlights the importance of meticulous record-keeping in intellectual property litigation.
*   **Registered Trademark vs. Unfair Competition:** Foodsphere's registered "PISTA" trademark didn't shield it from unfair competition liability. This illustrates that trademark registration offers *some*, but not *complete*, protection against related claims like unfair competition.
*   **Applicable Case Law:** The ruling references *In-N-Out Burger, Inc. v. Sehwani* (595 Phil. 1119 (2008) and *Shang Properties Realty Corporation, et al. v. St. Francis Development Corporation* (739 Phil. 244, 256 (2014)), highlighting the principle that the key to a finding of unfair competition is whether the acts of the defendant have the intent of deceiving or are calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the ordinary conditions of the particular trade to which the controversy relates.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 8293 (Intellectual Property Code), Section 168:** Unfair Competition
*   **Civil Code, Articles 2221, 2233, 2234:** Nominal and Exemplary Damages
