## Legal Document Summary - People v. Lumumba

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Danny Lumumba y Made*, G.R. No. 232354, August 29, 2018

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act) - illegal sale of 0.64 gram of marijuana.

**Holding:** Supreme Court **GRANTS** the appeal and **ACQUITS** the accused based on reasonable doubt. The CA decision is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Violation of Section 5, Art. II, RA 9165:** Illegal sale of dangerous drugs (marijuana).
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165):** The central issue revolves around significant breaches of the chain of custody rule and its implementing regulations, particularly regarding the mandatory presence of insulating witnesses (elected public official and representative from DOJ and media).
*   **Inventory and Photographing:** Specifically:
    *   Accused not asked to sign inventory.
    *   Lack of Barangay official/DOJ representative at inventory and no sufficient explanation for this absence (Sec 21 Requirements)
    *   Discrepancies in testimonies of PO1 Gadia and PO1 Bautista regarding where the photographing took place.

**Obligations of Apprehending Team:**

*   Conduct physical inventory and photograph seized items immediately after seizure/confiscation.
*   Ensure presence of accused (or representative), elected public official, DOJ representative, and media representative during inventory and photography. All are required to sign inventory copies.
*   Submit seized items to PDEA Forensic Laboratory within 24 hours of confiscation.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Defective Chain of Custody:** Failure to adhere strictly to Section 21 renders the corpus delicti questionable and jeopardizes the prosecution's case. *People v. Año, G.R. No. 230070, March 14, 2018*
*   **Unexplained Lapses:** Absence of justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 undermines the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Inconsistent Testimony:** Discrepancies in witness testimonies, particularly on material facts, weaken the prosecution's case. *People v. Rashid Binasing, G.R. No. 221439, July 4, 2018.*

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)**
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody)**, amended by RA 10640.
*   **People v. Mendoza:** Stresses the importance of the insulating presence of witnesses to prevent evidence tampering.
*   **People v. Año:** Outlines the procedure for handling seized drugs.
*   **People v. Almorfe & People v. De Guzman:** Emphasizes that justifiable ground for noncompliance with Section 21 must be proven as fact. Court cannot presume existence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "saving clause" of Section 21 (non-compliance excused if integrity preserved) is not applicable here due to the unexplained lapses and inconsistencies. The prosecution failed to demonstrate both justifiable grounds for non-compliance and preserved integrity/evidentiary value of the seized items.

**Legal Advice:**
The prosecution's failure to establish a clear chain of custody, coupled with procedural lapses and inconsistent witness testimony, led to the acquittal. Law Enforcement should ensure strict compliance with section 21 of RA 9165 or the prosecution risks having their evidence inadmissible.
