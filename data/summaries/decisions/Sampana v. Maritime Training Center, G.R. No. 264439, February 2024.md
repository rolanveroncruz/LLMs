Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Ramon O. Sampana v. The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines, et al.* (G.R. No. 264439, February 26, 2024)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that Ramon O. Sampana was a *regular employee* of The Maritime Training Center of the Philippines (TMTCP), was *illegally dismissed*, and is *entitled to backwages, retirement benefits, and attorney's fees*.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Employment Status:**
    *   The Court applied the *four-fold test* (selection/engagement, wages, power of dismissal, control) to determine the existence of employer-employee relationship. The court particularly emphasized the **control test**.
    *   It rejected TMTCP's characterization of Sampana's initial engagement as a "consultancy" and subsequent engagements as "fixed-term" employment contracts. The Court found that based on the actual duties and responsibilities Sampana held, the agreements were **employment contracts** disguised to avoid regular employment status.
    *   The Court cited *Article 295 [280] of the Labor Code* regarding regular employment.
    *   The Court reiterated the Brent School's criteria of valid fixed-term employment, pointing out that the contract was clearly a guise and there was unequal footing between Sampana and TMTCP and a moral dominance exerted by the latter on the former. The Court also cited *GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga (722 Phil. 161 (2013))* to further emphasize these criteria.
    * The Court cited *Samonte, et al. v. La Salle Greenhills, Inc. (780 Phil. 778 (2016))* to illustrate that being a professional does not automatically establish that he and TMTCP dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance exercised by TMTCP.

*   **Illegal Dismissal:**
    *   Because the court found Sampana to be a regular employee, he had the right to security of tenure, and thus couldn't be dismissed without just or authorized cause per *Article 294 of the Labor Code.*
    *   TMTCP's claim of "unsatisfactory service" as the reason for non-renewal was deemed insufficient, particularly in the absence of due process. The Court required the two-notice rule and hearing which had not been served to Sampana.
    *   The legal consequences of illegal dismissal were applied: reinstatement (or separation pay in lieu thereof) and full backwages. Since Sampana reached compulsory retirement age (65) during the litigation, reinstatement was impossible, so backwages were awarded from the date of illegal dismissal (December 21, 2016) until the date of retirement (February 16, 2021).
*   **Retirement Benefits:**
    *   The Court held that Sampana was entitled to retirement benefits under *Article 302 [287] of the Labor Code*, based on his age and tenure.
    *   The computation would be equivalent to 1/2 month salary for every year of service, computed at 22.5 days.
*   **Attorney's Fees:**
    *   Awarded at 10% of the total monetary award under *Article 111 of the Labor Code*, and to be remitted to the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) for their special allowances.
*   **Interest:**
    *   The total monetary award will earn legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid, as per *Nacar v. Gallery Frames (716 Phil. 267, 283 (2013)).*

**Obligations of TMTCP:**

*   Pay full backwages (Dec. 21, 2016 - Feb. 16, 2021).
*   Pay retirement benefits under Article 302 [287] of the Labor Code from February 16, 2021.
*   Pay attorney's fees (10% of total award) to PAO.
*   Pay legal interest (6% per annum) on the total monetary award from finality of the decision.

**Liabilities of TMTCP:**

*   Liability for illegal dismissal.
*   Monetary liability for backwages, retirement benefits, attorney's fees, and interest.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of Monetary Award:** Remand to the Labor Arbiter is necessary for computation which could lead to further disputes regarding the specific amounts.
*   **Concurring Opinion:** The concurring opinion by Justice Leonen suggests that damages should have been awarded in addition to the other monetary awards. This could be a point of contention or a basis for further legal action if Sampana pursues it.
