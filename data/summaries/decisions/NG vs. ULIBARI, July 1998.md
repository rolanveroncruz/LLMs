## Legal Document Summary: *A.M. No. MTJ-98-1158, July 30, 1998*

This Supreme Court decision concerns an administrative complaint filed by Atty. Nelson Y. Ng against Judge Leticia Q. Ulibari of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati, Branch 67, alleging "sheer ignorance of the law," gross incompetence, and neglect of duty. The Court found Judge Ulibari guilty of gross inefficiency and imposed a fine of P5,000.00 with a warning against future similar conduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Failure to Resolve Motions Promptly:** The core of the complaint centers on Judge Ulibari's alleged inaction or delayed action on pending motions in several civil cases. Specific instances include delayed resolution of:
    *   Motion to recall a witness (Civil Case No. 45497)
    *   Motion to declare defendants in default (Civil Case No. 49740)
    *   Motion to consolidate cases (Civil Cases Nos. 51902, 51916, 51923, and 51930)

*   **Erroneous Denial of Motion to Amend Complaint:** Complainant alleged "sheer ignorance of the law" regarding the denial of a motion to amend the complaint (Civil Case No. 49499) to implead another surety.

*   **Management Inefficiency:** Allegations include poor docket management, inability to delegate, and late arrival to court.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Requires judges to dispose of court business promptly and within prescribed periods.
*   **Canon 3, Rules 3.08 and 3.09 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Mandates diligent administrative responsibilities, competent court management, and efficient supervision of court personnel.
*   **Sec. 5 of the Interim Rules implementing B.P. Blg. 129:** Prescribes court session hours.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Gross Inefficiency:** Judge Ulibari was found guilty of this charge due to the documented delays in resolving motions and failing to properly manage her docket.
*   **Fine:** A fine of P5,000.00 was imposed.
*   **Warning:** A stern warning was issued against future repetition of similar acts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Guillermo vs. Reyes, Jr. 240 SCRA 154:** Cited regarding administrative accountability for erroneous orders, requiring gross or patent error, fraud, or gross ignorance for administrative sanctions.
*   **Marcelino vs. Singson, Jr., 243 SCRA 685:** Affirms that complainant's desistance doesn't automatically warrant dismissal of administrative cases.
*   **Dysico v. Dacumos, 262 SCRA 275 (1996); Guintu v. Lucero, 261 SCRA 1 (1996):** Cited regarding a judges obligation to promptly dispose of business.
*   **Sec. 5 of the Interim Rules implementing B.P. Blg. 129.**

**Potential Risks & Contentious Points:**

*   **Defense of Lack of Stenographer:** While acknowledged, the Court did not fully accept this as a complete excuse for the delays. The Court emphasized the 90-day period for resolving incidents applies regardless of stenographic notes.
*   **Docket Management:** Judge Ulibari's explanations regarding motions not brought to her attention reveal potential deficiencies in internal office procedures.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The court applied the standard of proof applicable to administrative cases, not requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt but instead relying on substantial evidence.
*   **Administrative vs. Judicial Error:**  The Court distinguished between administrative infractions and mere errors of judgment. The former is actionable, the latter correctable through ordinary judicial remedies.
