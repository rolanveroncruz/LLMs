**Case Summary: *Quasha Ancheta Pe√±a & Nolasco Law Office and Legend International Resorts, Limited vs. The Special Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals, Khoo Boo Boon and The Law Firm of Picazo Buyco Tan Fider & Santos***

**G.R. No. 182013, December 4, 2009 (Third Division)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to reverse a Court of Appeals (CA) resolution refusing to recognize the Entry of Appearance of Quasha Law Office as counsel for Legend International Resorts, Limited (LIRL).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Parties:**
    *   Petitioners: Quasha Law Office (new counsel) and LIRL (foreign corporation operating in Subic).
    *   Respondents: CA Special Sixth Division, Khoo Boo Boon (former CEO of LIRL-Subic), and Picazo Law Office (former counsel).
*   **Underlying Dispute:** LIRL filed a case (Civil Case No. 219-0-2004) against PAGCOR and SBMA regarding amendments to their agreement.  PAGCOR appealed (CA-G.R. CV No. 87281).
*   **Hong Kong Liquidation Orders:** The Hong Kong Court appointed liquidators for LIRL, granting them powers to manage the business, including in the Philippines, and to appoint counsel.
*   **Termination and Substitution of Counsel:** Liquidators terminated Picazo Law Office and engaged Quasha Law Office.
*   **CA's Refusal to Recognize Quasha:** The CA Special Sixth Division initially refused to recognize Quasha, arguing insufficient proof of liquidators' authority (requiring recognition of the foreign judgment).
*   **Conflicting CA Decisions:** A different CA division (Special Tenth Division) recognized Quasha's authority in a related case (CA-G.R. SP No. 96717).  That decision was appealed but the appeal was dismissed by the SC for being filed out of time and reversible error.
*   **Withdrawal of Quasha Appearance:** Quasha Law Office withdrew its appearance during the proceedings.

**Issues:**

1.  Did the CA gravely abuse its discretion by not deferring to the prior decision of a co-equal division of the CA?
2.  Did the CA gravely abuse its discretion by considering the Hong Kong liquidation orders as requiring enforcement of a foreign judgment?

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the Petition for Certiorari.
It held there was no Grave Abuse of Discretion amounting to Lack of Jurisdiction.
SC HELD: Res judicata, specifically conclusiveness of judgment, applies. Prior decisions held that the Hong Kong Court's order did not require enforcement of a foreign judgment. The act of terminating the old counsel and engaging the new counsel was an internal affair of LIRL. The previous decision of the Tenth Division of the CA had already been affirmed by the SC.

**Legal Principles & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Certiorari.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.  Cited *Suliguin v. COMELEC*.
*   **Res Judicata (Conclusiveness of Judgment):** A fact or question judicially passed upon is conclusively settled between the parties, barring relitigation. Cited *Heirs of Clemencia Parasac v. Republic of the Philippines*.
*   **Legarda v. Savellano:** Rationale for res judicata.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure):** Although the SC determined that the Hong Kong orders did not constitute a foreign judgment requiring enforcement in this case, this was a key point of contention.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Decisions of one CA division are not binding on other divisions (unless affirmed by the Supreme Court).
*   The SC upheld a broad interpretation of corporate power, allowing liquidators appointed by a foreign court to manage affairs and appoint counsel in the Philippines without requiring recognition of the foreign order as a foreign judgment requiring enforcement in the Philippines.
*   Res judicata (conclusiveness of judgment) can bar relitigation of specific issues, even if the cause of action differs.
