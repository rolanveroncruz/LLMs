**Legal Document Summary: *Republic vs. Cote***

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 challenging CA decision affirming RTC's recognition of a foreign divorce decree.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Art. 26, par. 2 of the Family Code:** Grants capacity to remarry to a Filipino spouse when the alien spouse validly obtains a divorce abroad.
*   **Rule 108 of the Rules of Court:** Governs special proceedings for cancellation or correction of entries in the civil registry. This is the appropriate mechanism for implementing Article 26.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:** (Rule on Nullity of Marriage) Held *not* applicable to recognition of foreign divorce decrees.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Filipino Spouse (Florie Cote):**  Obligation to prove the foreign divorce decree's validity and the alien spouse's capacity to remarry under their national law in the foreign jurisdiction. Must comply with Rule 108 requirements (notice, publication, impleading necessary parties).
*   **State (Republic):** Represented by OSG; has standing to participate in proceedings involving recognition of foreign divorce decrees and their impact on civil registry records.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Foreign Law:** Requires competent evidence of the foreign law allowing divorce and proof of the divorce decree's validity under that law (authentication). *Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas* and *Republic v. Orbecido III* are the controlling cases.
*   **Citizenship at Time of Divorce:** The key issue is whether Rhomel (the husband) was a citizen of the foreign jurisdiction at the time the divorce was obtained, not at the time of the marriage. This must be established through evidence.
*   **Rule 108 Compliance:** Strict compliance with Rule 108's procedural requirements is critical.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Republic v. Orbecido III, 509 Phil. 108 (2005):** Clarified that Article 26 applies if the alien spouse is a citizen of a foreign country when the divorce is obtained, regardless of prior citizenship.
*   **Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas, 642 Phil. 420 (2010):** Emphasized that recognition of a foreign divorce can be done within a Rule 108 proceeding and requires proof of foreign law and the foreign judgment's validity.
*   **A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC:**  This Rule governs proceedings to declare the Nullity of a marriage and has no bearing in Foreign Divorce decrees.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention was the incorrect application of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC by the RTC. The Supreme Court clarified that it does *not* apply to these cases. The key requirements relate to proof of the foreign divorce and the foreign spouse's citizenship at the time of divorce.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding that the RTC erred in applying A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC but that this error did not amount to grave abuse of discretion. The court reiterated the process for recognizing foreign divorce decrees involving a Filipino spouse and a foreign citizen as outlined in *Corpuz* and *Orbecido*, emphasizing the need to prove the foreign law and the alien spouse's citizenship at the time of divorce. The case is important because it highlights the correct procedure for recognizing foreign divorce decrees and clarifies the inapplicability of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC.
