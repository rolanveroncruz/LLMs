## Legal Document Summary: Olillesca v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 258449)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Certiorari under Rule 65)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Juan Juan Olila Ollesca (Candidate for President)
*   **Respondent:** Commission on Elections (COMELEC)

**Issue:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring Ollesca a nuisance candidate and denying his Motion for Reconsideration.

**Holding:**  Petition GRANTED. COMELEC Resolutions declaring Ollesca a nuisance candidate are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Nuisance Candidate Definition:** The Court reiterates that a nuisance candidate is one whose candidacy is lodged to create confusion, mocks the election process, or demonstrates no bona fide intention to run for office (Sec. 69, Omnibus Election Code).
*   **COMELEC's Actions:**
    *   COMELEC Law Department petitioned to declare Ollesca a nuisance candidate based on his purported lack of nationwide recognition and financial capacity to wage a campaign.
    *   COMELEC Second Division granted the petition, canceling Ollesca's Certificate of Candidacy.
    *   COMELEC En Banc denied Ollesca's Motion for Reconsideration as out of time (filed late) and for failing to pay assessed fees on time.
*   **Ollesca's Arguments:**
    *   Motion for Reconsideration was timely filed via email.
    *   COMELEC Law Department failed to meet the burden of proof demonstrating his lack of bona fide intent.
    *   COMELEC improperly imposed a property qualification by considering financial capacity.
    *   Ollesca asserts he had evidence of financial capacity and support for his candidacy.
*   **Court's Rationale:**
    *   **Timeliness of Motion:** COMELEC erred in calculating the filing date for the Motion for Reconsideration. The correct date is the date of electronic transmission (Rule 2, Sec. 9 of COMELEC Resolution No. 10673). Ollesca's filing was timely.
    *   **Belated Payment of Fees:** COMELEC's outright denial of the motion for reconsideration because of belated payment of the fee was capricious (Lloren v. COMELEC, 695 Phil. 288).
    *   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Court held that the COMELEC conflated financial capacity with bona fide intention to run, and such capacity cannot be used to create a "property qualification", which violates the constitution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code, Sec. 69:** Defines nuisance candidate.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 19, Section 2:** Governs the filing period for Motions for Reconsideration.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 10673, Rule 2, Section 9:** Pertains to electronic filing and service.
*   **Pamatong v. COMELEC, 470 Phil. 711 (2004):** Rationale behind prohibiting nuisance candidates.
*   **Maquera v. Borra, 122 Phil. 412 (1965):** Reiterates the prohibition of property qualifications for electoral candidates.
*   **Marquez v. COMELEC, 861 Phil. 667 (2019):** Prohibits conditioning the right to run for office on financial capacity.  COMELEC cannot conflate bona fide intent to run with financial capacity.
*   **De Alban v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 243968, March 22, 2022:** Reiteration of the requirement for the COMELEC Law Department to identify factual bases for showing a lack of bona fide intention.
*   **Marquez v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 258435, June 28, 2022:** Reiterates no law requiring membership in a political party as proof of intent.
*   **Lloren v. COMELEC, 695 Phil. 288 (2012):** COMELEC should not outright deny a motion for non-payment of fees but can refuse action until paid.

**Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC:** Must not impose property qualifications for running for public office. Must present evidence of a lack of bona fide intent to run, not simply a lack of financial capacity or nationwide recognition.  Must follow procedural rules regarding electronic filing and timeliness of motions.

**Liabilities:**

*   COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion; its resolutions were annulled.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Mootness:** While the 2022 elections are over, the Court ruled on the issue as it is "capable of repetition, yet evading review" and a recurring issue each election cycle.
*   **"Cookie Cutter" Motions:** The Court criticizes the COMELEC Law Department's propensity to file generic petitions alleging a lack of financial capacity, shifting the burden of proof to the candidate.
*   **Proof of Bona Fide Intent:** The Court emphasizes that a candidate needs to show "a significant modicum of support," but the threshold for this remains somewhat undefined. What constitutes sufficient evidence beyond a mere declaration of intent?  Further litigation is likely to explore this issue.
*   **Determining Bona Fide Intent:** The Court suggests that the COMELEC may consider the candidate's inability to organize a campaign, whether they have a nomination or lack a record of service to determine the lack of bona fide intent.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the COMELEC's decision to declare Ollesca a nuisance candidate. The ruling underscores the importance of protecting the right to run for public office and prohibits the COMELEC from using financial capacity as a proxy for bona fide intent. It also highlights the COMELEC's procedural errors in calculating the filing date of the Motion for Reconsideration. While the specific case is moot, the Court's decision provides valuable guidance on defining "nuisance candidates" and the limitations of COMELEC's power to restrict access to the ballot.
