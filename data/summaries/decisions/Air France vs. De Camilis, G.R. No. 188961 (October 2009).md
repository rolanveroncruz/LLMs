**Legal Document Summary: *Air France Philippines/KLM Air France v. John Anthony de Camilis, G.R. No. 188961 (2009)***

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming with modifications the RTC decision regarding breach of contract of carriage, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** The RTC and CA found Air France (AF) liable for breach of contract due to poor service, verbal abuse, and lack of respect by AF agents towards the respondent.
*   **Damages:**
    *   *Moral Damages:* Award of P1,000,000 affirmed by the CA.
    *   *Exemplary Damages:* Reduced by the CA from P1,000,000 to P300,000.
    *   *Actual Damages:* Reduced by the CA to US$906 (or its peso equivalent) representing expenses incurred from being unable to join the pilgrimage group until the dishonored flight reservation. Expenses related to the Moscow incident were deemed respondent's responsibility.
    *   *Attorney's Fees:* Award of P300,000 affirmed by the CA.
*   **Interest:** Legal interest of 6% p.a. from the date of the RTC judgment (April 25, 2007), increasing to 12% p.a. from the date the Supreme Court decision becomes final and executory until full satisfaction. *Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Estrella* and *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA* were cited for the determination of interest rates and commencement dates.

**Obligations:**

*   AF is obligated to pay the respondent moral damages, exemplary damages, actual damages, attorney's fees, and associated legal interest as determined by the CA and affirmed by the Supreme Court.

**Liabilities:**

*   AF is liable for the actions of its agents and representatives that resulted in the breach of contract and the damages suffered by the respondent.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Issues:** AF's argument hinges on factual issues which are generally outside the purview of a Rule 45 petition. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' factual findings.
*   **Damages Assessment:** AF argues that the awarded damages are exorbitant; however, the courts found justification for the award based on the evidence of the poor service, verbal abuse, and lack of respect demonstrated by AF's agents.
*   **Interest Calculation:** Failure to accurately calculate and pay the legal interest from the RTC judgment date (6%) and from the date of finality of the Supreme Court decision (12%) could result in further legal complications.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Limits the Supreme Court's review to questions of law.
*   *Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Estrella, G.R. No. 147791 (2006)* and *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. CA, 379 Phil. 84 (2000)*: Established the guidelines for the imposition of legal interest in cases involving breach of obligation and awards of damages.
*   **Articles 1169 of the Civil Code.**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA's apportionment of responsibility regarding the Moscow incident, holding the respondent responsible for securing the transit visa, while simultaneously holding AF liable for other aspects of the respondent's mistreatment, could be viewed as inconsistent. However, this was not successfully challenged before the Supreme Court.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied Air France's petition, upholding the CA's ruling (with modifications to interest) and solidifying AF's liability for the respondent's damages arising from the breach of contract of carriage. AF is obligated to pay the specified damages along with legal interest.
