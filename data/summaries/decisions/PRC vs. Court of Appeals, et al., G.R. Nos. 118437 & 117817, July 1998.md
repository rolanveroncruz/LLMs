## Legal Document Summary: PRC vs. CA, De Guzman et al. (G.R. Nos. 117817 & 118437)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari concerning the PRC's refusal to administer oaths and issue licenses to medical graduates from Fatima College of Medicine.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **G.R. No. 117817:** Focuses on whether the Court of Appeals erred in *not* ordering the dismissal of the mandamus petition filed by the medical graduates (De Guzman et al.) seeking to compel the PRC to administer their oaths and issue licenses after passing the board exams. The core question is whether the issuance of licenses is a purely ministerial function or if the PRC has discretionary power to withhold them based on doubts regarding an examinee's qualifications.
*   **G.R. No. 118437:** Concerns the trial judge's refusal to inhibit himself from hearing the mandamus case. Petitioners alleged bias due to the judge's perceived partiality toward the medical graduates.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The central obligation is the PRC's duty to administer oaths and issue licenses to qualified medical professionals. The issue is whether the PRC's perceived irregularities in the examinees' performance allow them to refuse to perform these obligations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Discretion vs. Ministerial Duty:** The core legal issue revolves around interpreting the extent of the PRC's discretion. Relevant case law (not explicitly cited but implied) would need to be examined to determine the boundaries of this discretion regarding professional licensing. Relevant statutes related to the powers and functions of PRC should also be examined.
*   **Allegations of Immorality/Fraud:** The underlying administrative case (Adm. Case No. 1687) alleging immorality, dishonest conduct, fraud, and deceit in connection with the examinations in Biochemistry and Obstetrics and Gynecology presents significant risks. The outcome of this case could impact the validity of the licenses, even if issued.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The court found that filing an appeal and a petition for certiorari simultaneously regarding the same decision comes very close to what constitutes forum shopping. The court did not hold it to the standard of forum shopping because the "issues in their appeal before the Court of Appeals are different from those in this petition."

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   The decision implicitly refers to statutes governing the Professional Regulation Commission's powers and duties, specifically those related to administering professional examinations and issuing licenses. These statutes must be analyzed.
*   *Lansang Jr. v. Court of Appeals* is cited regarding the exception to the rule on appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive, but held inapplicable in this case.
*   *Oriental Media, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* regarding mutually exclusive remedies of appeal and certiorari.

**Court Findings:**

*   **G.R. No. 117817:** Dismissed as moot because the trial court had already rendered a judgment ordering the PRC to issue the licenses, which was then appealed. The Supreme Court held that the issue was therefore moot.
*   **G.R. No. 118437:** Dismissed because the petitioners had already filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals and they are mutually exclusive remedies. The trial court already granted the mandamus petition and, instead of directly appealing, petitioners filed the petition against Judge Nitafan. The court found "a distinct possibility that the appellate court may reverse the lower court. In such event, its action could collide with a ruling finding no merit in petitioners' arguments before this Court. Such a situation would lead to absurdity and confusion in the ultimate disposition of the case."

**Overall Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed both petitions, finding G.R. No. 117817 moot and G.R. No. 118437 inappropriate due to the pending appeal in the Court of Appeals. The court admonished the Assistant Solicitor General for borderline forum shopping. However, the underlying issues regarding the PRC's discretionary power and the allegations against the medical graduates remain unresolved and subject to the outcome of the appeal. The appeal could determine the validity of licenses if issued.
