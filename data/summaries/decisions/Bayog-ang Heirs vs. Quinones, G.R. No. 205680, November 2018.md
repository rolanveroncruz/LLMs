## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Ciriaco Bayog-Ang v. Florence Quinones* (G.R. No. 205680)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision reversing RTC ruling in a Specific Performance with Damages case.

**Core Issue:** Conflicting claims over a parcel of land: Buyer (Quinones, now substituted by heirs) with unregistered Deed of Absolute Sale *versus* Heirs of the vendor (Bayog-Ang) who extrajudicially settled the estate and obtained a TCT in their names.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Ownership Transfer:** Court held that the notarized Deed of Absolute Sale (1964) between Bayog-Ang and Quinones effectively transferred ownership to Quinones upon execution, per Art. 1498, NCC. Delivery occurred via public instrument, absent contrary intention.
*   **Double Sale (Art. 1544, NCC) Inapplicability:** The Court correctly finds that Art. 1544 does not apply because the second transaction, as argued by the RTC, is not a sale but the extrajudicial settlement of estate. Thus, the proper question to ask is whether or not Bayog-Ang was able to prove that Bayog-Ang sold and transferred the property to Florence.
*   **Validity of Deed of Absolute Sale:** The Deed, being a public document (acknowledged before a notary public), enjoys the presumption of regularity (Spouses Santos v. Spouses Lumbao, 548 Phil. 332 (2007)). The petitioners failed to overcome this presumption.
*   **Succession:** Heirs cannot inherit property already sold by the decedent. Art. 776, NCC.
*   **Prescription/Laches:** Action is not barred by prescription or laches.
    *   The RTC considered the action as one for quieting of title, which does not prescribe.
    *   Complaint was timely filed after TCT issuance in Heirs' names (1997), disturbing prior possession.
    *   Heirs were aware of Quinones' claim and tenancy, negating laches defense.
*   **Registration:** Registration is *not* a mode of acquiring ownership, only confirms existing rights (Bollozos v. Yu Tieng Su, 239 Phil. 475). Registration by the Heirs is irrelevant as Bayog-Ang had already sold the land.
*   **Heirs Bound by Contract:** Heirs are bound by the contracts of their predecessor (Art. 1311, NCC).
*   **Tenant (Gasparillo):** The fact that Quinones had installed a tenant (Gasparillo) on the subject land indicates that Quinones was in possession of the same under claim of ownership.

**Obligations:**

*   **Heirs of Bayog-Ang:** Must present TCT No. T-91543 for annotation of the Deed of Absolute Sale.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Must annotate Deed of Absolute Sale on the TCT.
*   **Parties/Counsel:**  Must cause the subdivision survey of the 10,848 square meter lot to be conveyed to Quinones' heirs at their expense.

**Liabilities:** Heirs are liable to convey the property to Quinones' heirs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Survey Costs:** The burden of subdivision survey costs falls solely on the Quinones heirs.
*   **Good Faith of Heirs:** The good faith of the Heirs in executing the extrajudicial settlement is irrelevant, since they inherited nothing.
*   **Ambiguity:** There seems to be no specific amount of damages awarded to respondents despite filing a case for Specific Performance with Damages.
*   **Lack of Registration by Quinones:** While the court found that the rights to the land was properly transferred, the fact that the original buyer did not register the transfer of title created the legal ambiguity that made this lawsuit possible.

**Statutory References:**

*   **New Civil Code (NCC):** Art. 712 (Modes of acquiring ownership), Art. 774 (Succession definition), Art. 776 (Inheritance content), Art. 777 (Transmission of succession rights), Art. 1311 (Contract effectivity), Art. 1496 (Ownership via delivery), Art. 1497 (Delivery by placing in control), Art. 1498 (Delivery via public instrument), Art. 1544 (Double Sales).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 132, Sections 19 & 30 (Public Documents).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Spouses Santos v. Spouses Lumbao, 548 Phil. 332 (2007):** Presumption of regularity for notarized documents.
*   **Consolidated Rural Bank (Cagayan Valley), Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 489 Phil. 320 (2005):** On double sales.
*   **Sapto, et al. v. Fabiana, 103 Phil. 683 (1958):** Action to quiet title and prescription.
*   **Go Chi Gun v. Co Cho, 96 Phil. 622 (1955):** Elements of Laches.
*   **Bollozos v. Yu Tieng Su, 239 Phil. 475 (1987):** Nature of registration.
*   **DKC Holdings Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 386 Phil. 107 (2000):** Heirs are bound by contracts of predecessors in interest.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, ruling in favor of Quinones' heirs. The key takeaway is the effectivity of a duly executed Deed of Absolute Sale in transferring ownership, even without registration, and its impact on subsequent estate settlements. The Heirs' claim based on the extrajudicial settlement fails because the land no longer belonged to their predecessor at the time of his death. The risks are minimal assuming timely execution of the survey and transfer. However, there is a slight risk given the time that has passed, that there are now other occupants of the land that were not considered in the decision.
