**Case Summary: *People v. Ahmad*, G.R. No. 228955, March 14, 2018**

This Supreme Court case involves Al Shierav Ahmad's appeal of his conviction for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act). The RTC and CA both found him guilty. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction and acquitted Ahmad due to reasonable doubt, focusing on deficiencies in the chain of custody of the seized drugs and the arresting officers' non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sections 5 & 11:** Defines and penalizes illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. Prosecution must prove identity of buyer/seller, object/consideration, delivery/payment (sale); possession, lack of authority, and knowledge of possession (possession). The *corpus delicti* is the dangerous drug itself.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21 (as amended by R.A. 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs. Requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items *at the place of seizure* (or nearest police station/office if warrantless seizure) in the presence of:
    *   The accused or their representative/counsel
    *   An elected public official
    *   A representative from the National Prosecution Service (formerly DOJ) or the media
    *   All parties must sign the inventory and receive a copy.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused was potentially liable for life imprisonment and a fine for illegal sale (Section 5) and 12 years and 1 day to 12 years and 2 days imprisonment and a fine for illegal possession (Section 11).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The court found the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody. Specifically problematic:
    *   Delay in marking and inventory of seized items until after arriving at the PDEA office.
    *   Uncertainty regarding handling of drugs from seizure until marking. Potential for tampering/contamination.
    *   Inconsistent testimony from prosecution witnesses regarding location of operation and when the media representative was contacted.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21 R.A. 9165:**
    *   Inventory and photography not conducted *immediately* at the place of arrest (or nearest office) nor in the presence of all required witnesses.
    *   Justification for deviation (dangerous area) was deemed insufficient and unsubstantiated.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties does not apply when evidence suggests that the officers deviated from the law.
*   **Prosecution Reliance on Unsupported Allegations:** Court refused to presume justifiable grounds for non-compliance or accept bare allegations of dangerousness.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002)**
*   **R.A. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. 9165, Section 21)**
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes importance of marking seized drugs immediately and timing in proving chain of custody.
*   **People v. Barte, G.R. No. 179749, March 1, 2017:** Prosecution must provide credible justification for failure to comply with Section 21.
*   **Mallilin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008):** Limits presumption of regularity in police conduct when evidence of deviation from procedure exists.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "dangerous area" justification for delaying the inventory/marking. The Court found the prosecution's explanation vague and unsubstantiated, highlighting the need for concrete evidence to support such claims.
* The conflicting accounts as to why the inventory was not done at the place of the operation.

**Legal Precision:**

The decision emphasizes that Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is a matter of substantive law, not a mere procedural technicality. Strict compliance is crucial to safeguard the integrity of the evidence and protect the rights of the accused. The prosecution bears the heavy burden of proving an unbroken chain of custody and providing justifiable grounds for any deviation from the prescribed procedures. Failure to meet these standards can lead to acquittal based on reasonable doubt.
