**Case Summary: Lagatic v. NLRC, Cityland Development Corporation, et al. (G.R. No. 121004, January 28, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking reversal of NLRC resolution affirming Labor Arbiter's decision upholding the validity of employee dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Whether Romeo Lagatic (Petitioner) was illegally dismissed by Cityland Development Corporation (Respondent).  Specifically, whether the dismissal was for a valid cause and with due process.

**Facts:** Lagatic was dismissed for failure to submit required "cold call" reports despite previous reprimands and suspension. He also wrote a defiant statement ("TO HELL WITH COLD CALLS!") displayed to colleagues. He filed a complaint alleging illegal dismissal and various wage-related claims.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *affirmed* the NLRC decision, finding the dismissal valid.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Company Policy:** Cityland required marketing specialists to make cold calls and submit daily progress reports.  Court upheld employer's right to make reasonable rules/regulations (citing *Manila Electric Co. vs. NLRC, 263 SCRA 531 (1996)*).
*   **Employee Duty:** Lagatic had a duty to comply with Cityland's reasonable policies.
*   **Grounds for Dismissal:**  Willful disobedience of reasonable and lawful employer orders, considered just cause (Article 297 of the Labor Code)
*   **Due Process:** Employer must provide two written notices: (1) notice of charges, and (2) notice of dismissal. Employee must be given an opportunity to be heard. (citing *Pono vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 118860, July 17, 1997.*).  Formal hearing is not required if the employee has the opportunity to present a defense.
*   **Commissions:** Computation method for commissions was at company discretion (citing a DOLE letter-opinion). The court rejected the non-diminution argument.  Sales commisions can be reduced if the sales quota is not met.

**Liabilities:**
* Employee liable for the cost of litigation.
* Employer has no liability since the employee was found to be dismissed for just cause.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Willful Disobedience":** The definition of "willful" (characterized by a wrongful and perverse attitude) can be subjective. However, the court considered 28 instances of non-compliance as strong evidence of willfulness.
*   **Sufficiency of Opportunity to be Heard:** The court found the employee had adequate opportunity to be heard despite lack of a formal hearing. This may be contentious if the employee can demonstrate that the opportunity to present evidence was limited or unfairly restricted.
*   **Overtime Pay Issue:** The court acknowledged that Cityland's practice of offsetting rest day/holiday work with time off on regular days was improper. But the claim was dismissed because the employee failed to submit sufficient evidence as to the number of days and hours he rendered overtime and rest day work
*   **Admissibility of Co-employee Affidavits:** The court gave weight to affidavits from co-employees attesting to the employee's defiant statement. The lack of confrontation could be a point of contention.
