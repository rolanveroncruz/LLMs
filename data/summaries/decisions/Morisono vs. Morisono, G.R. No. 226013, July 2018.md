## Legal Document Summary: *Morisono v. Morisono* (G.R. No. 226013)

**Case:** *Luzviminda Dela Cruz Morisono v. Ryoji Morisono and Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City*

**Issue:** Whether a Philippine court can recognize a foreign divorce decree procured by a Filipino citizen against their alien spouse, allowing the Filipino citizen to remarry.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court, applying *Republic v. Manalo* (G.R No. 221029, April 24, 2018), held that foreign divorce decrees obtained to nullify marriages between a Filipino and an alien citizen *may* be recognized in the Philippines, *regardless of who initiated the divorce.* The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings to establish (1) the fact of the divorce and (2) its conformity with Japanese law.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 26(2) of the Family Code:** This provision allows a Filipino spouse to remarry if a valid divorce is obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating them to remarry. *Manalo* expanded this to apply even when the Filipino spouse initiated the divorce.
*   **Obligation on Filipino Spouse:**  The Filipino spouse seeking recognition of the foreign divorce has the burden to prove (a) a valid marriage with the alien, (b) the fact of the divorce decree, and (c) that the divorce is valid under the foreign law.  Citing *Garcia v. Recio* (418 Phil. 723, 731 (2001)).
*   **Comity:** The principle of comity allows Philippine courts to recognize valid foreign judgments, including divorce decrees.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Foreign Law:** The petition will be denied if Luzviminda fails to adequately prove that the "Divorce by Agreement" and its recording were valid under Japanese law. This requires evidence of Japanese divorce laws (e.g., expert testimony or official publications).
*   **Property Implications:** The decision acknowledges that while the divorce itself may be recognized, the legal effects (custody, support, property relations) are subject to determination by Philippine courts.  This could create uncertainty and require further litigation.
*   **Misinterpretation of *Manalo***: *Manalo* removes the *nationality* barrier to recognizing foreign divorces.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code, Article 26(2):** The core provision governing remarriage after foreign divorce.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 15 & 17:** Relate to the nationality principle (laws bind citizens even abroad) and the law of the place of execution, respectively.
*   ***Republic v. Manalo* (G.R No. 221029, April 24, 2018):**  Extended Article 26(2) to cases where the Filipino spouse initiated the divorce.
*   ***Republic v. Orbecido III* (509 Phil. 108 (2005)):**  Established initial requirements for applying Article 26(2).
*   ***Van Dorn v. Judge Romillo, Jr.* (223 Phil. 357 (1985)):** Established that an alien could obtain a divorce recognized in the Philippines.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Japanese Law:** The level of proof required to establish the validity of the Japanese divorce law is not explicitly defined. *Garcia v. Recio* suggests the need for official publications or expert testimony.

**Overall Assessment:**

This decision overturns a previous denial of recognition based solely on the fact that the Filipino spouse initiated the divorce. However, it remands the case for proof of the divorce decree's validity under Japanese law. The Filipino spouse now bears the burden of providing sufficient evidence of Japanese divorce laws and the specific procedures followed in obtaining the "Divorce by Agreement." The long-term implications on property division and other related issues remain subject to future litigation.
