## Legal Document Summary: De La Salle Montessori International of Malolos, Inc. vs. De La Salle Brothers, Inc., et al. (G.R. No. 205548)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the CA's decision affirming the SEC's order for the Petitioner to change its corporate name.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in not applying the doctrine in *Lyceum of the Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 101897) regarding exclusivity of the term "Lyceum."

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, affirming the CA's decision. The SC upheld the SEC's order directing De La Salle Montessori International of Malolos, Inc. to change its corporate name.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 18 of the Corporation Code:** Prohibits the SEC from allowing a corporate name that is identical or deceptively or confusingly similar to that of an existing corporation or any name already protected by law.
*   **Right to Corporate Name:** The right to exclusive use of a corporate name is a property right determined by priority of adoption (citing *Western Equipment and Supply Co. v. Reyes*).
*   The Court states that each corporation must have a name by which it is to sue and be sued and do all legal acts (citing *Philips Export B.V. v. Court of Appeals*).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Infringement on Corporate Name:** De La Salle Montessori International of Malolos, Inc.'s use of "De La Salle" creates a confusing similarity with the Respondents' established corporate names, violating Section 18 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Likelihood of Confusion:** The SC found that the similarity in names, coupled with the similar business of providing pre-elementary, elementary, and secondary education, creates a probability of confusion. The court states that proof of actual confusion need not be shown and it suffices that confusion is probable or likely to occur.
*   **Power of SEC:** The SEC has exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the protection accorded to corporate names under Section 18 and prevent confusion in their use.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 18:** Restriction on corporate names.
*   ***Western Equipment and Supply Co. v. Reyes***: Affirms the proprietary right to a corporate name.
*   ***Philips Export B.V. v. Court of Appeals***:  Establishes the two requisites for infringement of corporate name: (1) prior right and (2) confusing similarity, identifiability, or deceptiveness.
*   ***Lyceum of the Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Petitioner argued that the facts are the same and this ruling should apply. The Court found that case to be dissimilar and held that the phrase "De La Salle" is not generic in relation to respondents.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court**: The Petition was framed as a Petition for Review on Certiorari, where grave abuse of discretion is not an allowable ground.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Petitioner's argument on the meaning of "De La Salle":** Petitioner argued that it derived the phrase from the French word for "classroom," while Respondents derived it from Saint Jean Baptiste de La Salle. The court rejected this argument, finding the phrase not to be generic.
*   **Petitioner's argument of no actual confusion:** The court disregarded Petitioner's argument that its clients were aware it was not affiliated with the Respondents, stating that proof of actual confusion is not required.
*   **The erroneous wording of the issue by Petitioner:** The court noted that the Petitioner used a Petition for Review on Certiorari but claimed grave abuse of discretion while attributing error of judgment on the part of the CA in not applying a certain doctrine.

**Potential Risks for De La Salle Montessori International of Malolos, Inc.:**

*   **Non-Compliance:** Failure to comply with the SEC's order to change its corporate name could result in penalties or further legal action.
*   **Loss of Goodwill:** Changing its name might negatively impact its existing goodwill and brand recognition.
*   **Further Litigation:** Respondents might pursue additional claims for damages related to the past use of the infringing name.
