## Legal Document Summary: People v. Reyes and Santa Maria, G.R. No. 219953

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.

**Parties:**

*   **Plaintiff-Appellee:** People of the Philippines
*   **Accused-Appellants:** Angelita Reyes y Ginove and Josephine Santa Maria y Sanchez (Reyes' appeal was dispensed with due to death)

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Police conducted a buy-bust operation based on a confidential informant's report. PO2 Talosig acted as poseur-buyer, purchasing 0.02 grams of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (Shabu) from Reyes and Santa Maria.
*   **Arrest and Seizure:** Appellants were arrested, and the marked money was recovered.  The seized evidence was marked "DT-AR-JS" at the police station, inventoried, and photographed. Request for laboratory examination was prepared.
*   **Chain of Custody:** PO2 Talosig delivered the seized evidence and request to the crime laboratory. Forensic Chemist P/Insp. Ma. Shirlee M. Ballete found the specimen positive for Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride in Chemistry Report No. D-381-2006, incidentally marking the plastic sachet itself as "D-381" to correspond to the number of the Chemistry Report.
*   **Defense:** Appellants denied the allegations, claiming they were victims of a frame-up.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and sentenced them to Life Imprisonment and pay a fine in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) PESOS.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Legal Issues and Analysis:**

*   **Validity of Warrantless Arrest:** The Court finds that the buy-bust operation constituted a valid warrantless arrest. Citing *People v. Rebotazo, 711 Phil. 150, 162 (2013).* and *People v. Manlangits, 654 Phil. 427, 437 (2011).*
*   **Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** The Supreme Court held that the prosecution failed to prove the appellants' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The identity of the seized item was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The Court cited *People v. Ismael y Radang, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017*
*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, R.A. 9165):** The Court found a significant breach in the chain of custody under the *old* provisions of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). Citing *People v. Gatlabayan, 699 Phil. 240. 252 (2011).*
*  **Non-compliance with Sec. 21, R.A. 9165:**  The Court held that the lack of a media representative and a representative from the National Prosecution Service during the inventory and photography of the seized items, as required under Section 21 of R.A. 9165, was a fatal flaw. The prosecution failed to provide a justifiable ground for this non-compliance.
*   **Rationale for Sec. 21 Compliance:** The Court acknowledges the rationale behind Section 21, emphasizing its purpose of safeguarding the integrity of evidence and preventing planting. Citing *People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018*

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Josephine Santa Maria due to the prosecution's failure to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on a breach in the chain of custody.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Section 21:** The decision reinforces a strict interpretation of the chain of custody rule under R.A. 9165, highlighting the importance of full compliance with the presence of required witnesses (media and DOJ/NPS representatives). Failure to provide *justifiable grounds* for deviations from the procedures could lead to acquittal.
*   **Miniscule Amount of Drugs:**  The Court alludes to a stricter adherence to Section 21 being required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is miniscule since it is highly susceptible to planting, tampering, or alteration.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sec. 5, Art. II
*   R.A. No. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. 9165)
*   Revised Penal Code, Article 125.
*   *People v. Rebotazo, 711 Phil. 150, 162 (2013).*
*   *People v. Manlangits, 654 Phil. 427, 437 (2011).*
*   *People v. Ismael y Radang, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017*
*   *People v. Gatlabayan, 699 Phil. 240. 252 (2011).*
*   *People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018*

**Recommendations:**

*   For similar cases, meticulously document compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.
*   If strict compliance is impossible, clearly and convincingly articulate and prove "justifiable grounds" for any deviations in the apprehending officer's sworn affidavit.
*   Pay stricter attention to the chain of custody procedure when a miniscule amount of drugs has been seized.
