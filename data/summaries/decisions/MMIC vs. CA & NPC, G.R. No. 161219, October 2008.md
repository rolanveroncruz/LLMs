## Legal Document Summary: Marinduque Mining vs. NAPOCOR (G.R. No. 161219)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing CA decision reinstating NAPOCOR's appeal in an expropriation case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in finding the RTC abused its discretion by denying NAPOCOR's appeal for improper service (registered mail instead of personal service) and whether NAPOCOR's appeal should be dismissed for failure to file a record on appeal.

**Background:** NAPOCOR filed an expropriation suit against Marinduque Mining for land needed for a transmission line project. The RTC determined the value of the expropriated land and also awarded consequential damages for a "dangling area" rendered unusable by the project. NAPOCOR appealed the supplemental decision regarding the "dangling area" but served the notice of appeal via registered mail. The RTC denied the appeal, citing a violation of Rule 13, Section 11 (requiring personal service when practicable). The CA reversed, ordering the RTC to give due course to the appeal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 13, Section 11, Rules of Court:** Mandates personal service of pleadings when practicable, with a written explanation required for alternative service methods (e.g., registered mail). Failure to comply may result in the pleading being considered not filed.
*   **Expropriation Proceedings (Eminent Domain):** Establishes NAPOCOR's right to exercise eminent domain for public purpose, subject to payment of just compensation.
*   **Determination of Just Compensation:** The RTC determines the fair market value of the expropriated property and any consequential damages.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NAPOCOR:** Risk of higher compensation if the appeal is unsuccessful. Potential liability for consequential damages to the "dangling area." Risk of the project being delayed if expropriation is contested.
*   **Marinduque Mining:** Risk of receiving less compensation than desired if NAPOCOR's appeal is successful. Risk of further project delay if NAPOCOR appeal unsuccessful.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 13, Section 11, Rules of Court:**  Governs service of pleadings.
*   **Expropriation Law:** Governs the state's right to take private property for public use with just compensation.
*   **Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. v. Ricafort, 355 Phil. 404 (1998):** Clarifies the application of Rule 13, Section 11, emphasizing personal service as the general rule and requiring a valid explanation for resorting to alternative methods.
*   **Municipality of Bi√±an v. Garcia, G.R. No. 69260, 22 December 1989, 180 SCRA 576:** Two-stage expropriation cases are considered in this.
*   **Tan v. Republic, G.R. No. 170740, 25 May 2007, 523 SCRA 203:** Separate appeals allowed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Practicability" of Personal Service:** The interpretation of "practicable" in Rule 13, Section 11 is contentious.  The RTC initially found NAPOCOR's explanation (lack of manpower) insufficient, while the CA considered it acceptable. This is resolved in favor of NAPOCOR due to the public interest.
*   **Necessity of Record on Appeal:** When should it be required.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court DENIED Marinduque Mining's petition and AFFIRMED the CA decision. The Court held that:

1.  NAPOCOR sufficiently explained its use of registered mail for service of the notice of appeal.
2.  A record on appeal was not required because the trial court had already fully resolved all issues, including the issue on consequential damages.

**Legal Significance:**

The ruling reinforces the liberal interpretation of procedural rules, particularly Rule 13, Section 11, when substantial justice and public interest are at stake. It also clarifies when a record on appeal is necessary in expropriation cases, limiting it to instances where the trial court's decision does not fully resolve all issues.
