Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) vs. Manila Electric Company (Meralco)*, G.R. No. 239829, May 29, 2024

**Subject Matter:**  Interpretation of Section 8 of the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA) regarding the sale and transfer of sub-transmission assets (STAs) and the mandatory requirement of a consortium between connected distribution utilities.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** TRANSCO (now succeeded by PSALM Corp.) entered into a Contract to Sell certain STAs (Dasmariñas-Abubot-Rosario 115 kV Line and Rosario Substation Equipment – "DAR Assets," Tayabas 115 kV Switchyard, and Ternate Substation Equipment) to Meralco.

*   **ERC Approval:** The ERC partially approved the sale, disapproving the sale of the DAR Assets, finding that CEZ (Cavite Economic Zone), another distribution utility, was connected to them, requiring a consortium.

*   **Section 8, EPIRA Interpretation:** The core issue is the interpretation of Section 8, paragraph 6, of EPIRA, which states that where two or more distribution utilities are connected to a STA, a "consortium or juridical entity *shall* be formed" and granted a franchise by the ERC.

*   **PEZA's Waiver:** PEZA (Philippine Economic Zone Authority), the entity managing CEZ, waived its right to purchase the DAR Assets in favor of Meralco. Meralco argued this waived the need for a consortium.

*   **CA Amended Decision:** The Court of Appeals (CA), in its Amended Decision, reversed the ERC, holding that PEZA's waiver dispensed with the consortium requirement and approved the sale of the DAR assets to Meralco. It reasoned that the law does not impose upon a qualified distribution utility the obligation to acquire the STAs connected to it.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **CA Reversed:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, reinstating the original CA Decision and ERC Orders. It held that Section 8, paragraph 6, of EPIRA is *clear and mandatory*. The word "shall" necessitates the formation of a consortium.

*   **No Waiver Exception:** The Court found that the law provides no exception for waivers. It rejected Meralco's argument that special circumstances (legal impediment to PEZA to form consortium) justified relaxing the consortium requirement.  To rule that the subject Section 8, paragraph 6 of the EPIRA be construed as "permissive" rather than mandatory would undoubtedly set a dangerous precedent.

*   **Statutory Construction:** The Court applied the plain meaning rule (*verba legis*). When a statute is clear and unambiguous, it must be applied literally without interpretation.

*   **ERC's Expertise:** The Court gave great weight to the ERC's findings of fact and technical expertise, which the CA did not give sufficient weight to.

*   **DAR Assets Reclassification:** The ERC had also determined that the DAR Assets "should be reclassified as transmission asset, and can no longer be subject of sale" because of the connection of a generator.

**Obligations:**

*   **Meralco:** Must form a consortium with PEZA to acquire the DAR Assets if still considered a STA. If DAR assets are transmission assets, Meralco is prohibited from acquiring the same pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 and 8 of the EPIRA, as well as Rule 6 of its IRR,
*   **PEZA:** Has the option to enter into a consortium with Meralco, potentially with limited subscription rights or participation in operations outside the CEZ.
*   **TRANSCO (now PSALM Corp.):** Obligated to divest STAs to qualified distribution utilities, but relieved of this obligation if no qualified utility agrees to form a consortium.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Meralco:** Risk of not acquiring the DAR Assets if it cannot form a consortium with PEZA.
*   **Potential rate changes:** If the DAR 115 kV Line is reclassified from a subtransmission asset to a transmission asset, this would affect Meralco's financial interest.
*   **NGCP:** Could be held liable for damages if they fail to provide open and non-discriminatory access to its transmission system.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (EPIRA), Section 8:** Crucial statutory provision being interpreted.
*   **Republic Act No. 7916, Section 12(c)** The Special Economic Zones Act (1995).
*   **ERC Resolution No. 15, Series of 2011 Article III, Section 2:** Amended Guidelines Covering the Sale & Transfer of Subtransmission Assets and Franchising of Qualified Consortiums.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The potential for a distribution utility to waive its right to form a consortium when there are two or more connected distribution utilities. The Supreme Court rules no exception to form a consortium even if a distribution utility has a legal impediment to form the same.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The decision reinforces the mandatory nature of the consortium requirement under Section 8 of EPIRA.
*   It emphasizes the importance of following the plain meaning of statutes and deferring to the expertise of administrative agencies like the ERC.
*   It clarifies that waivers from connected distribution utilities do not automatically negate the consortium requirement.
*   Subtransmission Guidelines and Amended Rules states that the final sale and transfer of STAs by TRANSCO to a qualified distribution utility must be approved by the ERC.
