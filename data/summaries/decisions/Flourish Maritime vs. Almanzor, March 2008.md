## Legal Document Summary: Flourish Maritime Shipping v. Almanzor

**Case:** Flourish Maritime Shipping and Lolita Uy v. Donato A. Almanzor, G.R. No. 177948, March 14, 2008 (572 Phil. 476)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming with modification the NLRC's decision, which affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision finding illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Two-year employment contract as fisherman with Flourish Maritime Shipping (agency) with a monthly salary of NT15,840.00, free meals, and suitable accommodations.
*   **Section 10, RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):**  Governs monetary claims for illegal termination of overseas employment.  Specifically, compensation for unexpired portion of the employment contract, or three months' salary for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is less.
*   **Petitioners' Defense:**  Alleged voluntary resignation by the Respondent and failure to comply with grievance machinery.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Flourish Maritime Shipping):** Fulfill the terms of the employment contract, including salary, provision of meals and accommodation.  Legal and just basis for termination of employment.
*   **Employee (Almanzor):**  Fulfill duties as fisherman according to the contract.
*   **Agency (Lolita Uy):** responsible for ensuring that the terms of the employment contract are upheld.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Flourish Maritime Shipping and Lolita Uy (jointly and solidarily):** Liable for illegal dismissal and monetary compensation due to the failure to redeploy respondent after repatriation, which was not caused by his voluntary resignation.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Resignation" Letters/Quitclaims:**  Petitioners presented these to prove voluntary resignation, but the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA found them insufficient to overcome the evidence of illegal dismissal. Could be argued as invalid quitclaims due to lack of informed consent or consideration.
*   **Grievance Machinery:** Petitioners argued that the Respondent did not exhaust the contractually stipulated grievance procedures; however, the Labor Arbiter and NLRC found that petitioners failed to prove a provision for such procedure.
*   **Compensation Calculation:** Section 10 of RA 8042 is the center of the issue. The proper calculation is not full compensation for the entire remainder of the contract if less than one year remained.
* **Factual Findings:** The Petitioners are arguing questions of fact which is not the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

**Case Law:**

*   **Marsaman Manning Agency Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission (371 Phil. 827 (1999)):** Establishes the interpretation of Section 10 of RA 8042, specifying when the "three-month salary rule" applies.
*   **Olarte v. Nayona (461 Phil. 429 (2003)) and JSS Indochina Corporation v. Ferrer (G.R. No. 156381, October 14, 2005):**  Cited as precedent for applying the three-month salary rule.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995):** Primarily Section 10, governing money claims in illegal dismissal cases of OFWs.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court granted the petition in part. They affirmed the illegal dismissal finding but MODIFIED the monetary award. The Court awards the amount equivalent to six months' salary, calculated under the "three months for every year of unexpired term" rule of Section 10 of RA 8042, because the term of the contract covered a 2 year period.
