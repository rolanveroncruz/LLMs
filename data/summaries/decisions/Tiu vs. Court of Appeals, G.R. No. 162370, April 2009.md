**Case:** *David Tiu vs. Court of Appeals and Edgardo Postanes* G.R. No. 162370, April 21, 2009

**Summary:**
This case involves a petition for review assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision which annulled the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision. The RTC had declared void the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC) acquittal of Respondent Edgardo Postanes for grave threats. The CA reversed the RTC, holding that the RTC improperly granted the State a right to appeal an acquittal, violating Postanes' right against double jeopardy. The Supreme Court (SC) denied Tiu's petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The central issue revolves around double jeopardy. The SC found all elements of double jeopardy present: a sufficient Information, MeTC jurisdiction, Postanes' arraignment and plea, and dismissal of the case based on insufficiency of evidence, amounting to acquittal. This triggers the constitutional protection against being tried twice for the same offense. *Statutory Reference:* Section 21, Article III of the Constitution; Rule 117, Section 7 of the Rules of Court. *Case Law:* *People v. Hernandez, G.R. Nos. 154218 and 154372, 28 August 2006*; *Heirs of Tito Rillorta v. Firme, L-54904, 29 January 1988.*
*   **Appeal of Acquittal:** The CA correctly noted that the prosecution cannot appeal an acquittal. *Statutory Reference:* Section 1, Rule 122 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Consolidation of Cases:** The MeTC did not err in considering evidence from the consolidated case for slight physical injuries (Criminal Case No. 96-412) when deciding the grave threats case (Criminal Case No. 96-413). *Statutory Reference:* Revised Rules on Summary Procedure.
*   **Formal Offer of Evidence:** While Postanesâ€™ counsel belatedly submitted a formal offer of evidence in Criminal Case No. 96-413, testimonial evidence from Postanes, Aynaga, and Samson supporting Postanes' defense was properly offered when the witnesses were called to testify under Section 35 of Rule 132.

**Obligations:**

*   The State is obligated to respect the accused's constitutional right against double jeopardy.
*   The MeTC is obligated to hear and decide cases fairly, considering all admissible evidence.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly stated, but the RTC's initial judgment exposed the judicial system to criticism for violating fundamental constitutional rights.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Erroneous Interpretation of Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Risk of an RTC improperly invoking "grave abuse of discretion" to overturn acquittals, thereby undermining double jeopardy protections.
*   **Procedural Lapses:** The defense's failure to properly submit a formal offer of evidence created a potential argument for lack of due process; the prosecution may raise this issue on remand of similar cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The RTC's rationale for finding grave abuse of discretion based on the MeTC's consideration of evidence from the consolidated case is weak. This highlights the potential for subjective interpretation of "grave abuse of discretion."

**Relevant Case Law (Besides those cited in the document):**

*   Consider cases defining the limits of certiorari in criminal cases, particularly where the prosecution alleges grave abuse of discretion. *e.g.*, *People v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128986, December 4, 1998*
*   Review cases discussing what constitutes a "valid" acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.
*   Cases discussing the SolGen's exclusive power to represent the State, especially its exceptions.
