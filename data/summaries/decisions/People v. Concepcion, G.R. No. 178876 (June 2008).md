## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Concepcion*, G.R. No. 178876

**Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Alfredo and Henry Concepcion for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 - Illegal Sale, Trading, Delivery of Dangerous Drugs (Shabu).
*   **Penalty:** Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00, sustained despite R.A. 9346 (prohibiting death penalty)
*   **Facts:** A buy-bust operation conducted by PDEA based on a confidential informant's tip. Alfredo Concepcion allegedly sold two sachets of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer (PO2 Sistemio). Henry Concepcion participated in the transaction. A third sachet was found in the vehicle's glove compartment.

**Obligations:**

*   Alfredo and Henry Concepcion have an obligation to serve their sentence of life imprisonment and pay the fine.
*   The Branch Clerk of Court is directed to turn over the seized drugs to the Dangerous Drugs Board for disposal.

**Liabilities:**

*   Alfredo Concepcion is liable for selling/delivering dangerous drugs.
*   Henry Concepcion is liable for conspiracy in the sale/delivery.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The integrity of the chain of custody was questioned, but the Court found it intact. Risk of challenge regarding the handling of the evidence, if the chain of custody is deemed questionable.
*   **Sec. 21 R.A. 9165 non-compliance:** Initial physical inventory and photograph of the seized items were not followed immediately after the seizure and confiscation, and in the presence of the accused persons from whom such items were confiscated.
*   **Coordination with PDEA:** The defense raised the argument that the buy-bust operation was not coordinated with the PDEA
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** While the Court found the buy-bust operation valid, there's potential for challenging whether the actions of the poseur-buyer constituted entrapment or illegal instigation, although the ruling favors the legality of the operation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines the crime of illegal sale, trading, delivery, etc., of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Presumption of Regularity in Performance of Official Duty:** Applied to the PDEA agents, shifting the burden to the defense to prove improper motive or irregularity.
*   ***People v. Del Monte, G.R. No. 179940, 23 April 2008:*** Non-compliance with Sec. 21 is not fatal and will not render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible.
*   ***People v. Yang, 467 Phil. 492, 509 (2004):*** Arresting officers' alleged failure to inform them of their Miranda rights or the nature of their arrest should have been raised before arraignment.
*  ***People v. Cabugatan, G.R. No. 172019, 12 February 2007, 515 SCRA 537, 552:*** In this jurisdiction, the conduct of a buy-bust operation is a common and accepted mode of apprehending those involved in the illegal sale of prohibited or regulated drugs.
*   ***People v. Cadley, 469 Phil. 515, 525 (2004):*** Flexibility is a trait of good police work

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Lack of physical inventory & photograph:** The defense argued the buy-bust operation was of doubtful legitimacy because of the failure of the prosecution to present in evidence the physical inventory and the photograph of the evidence confiscated as required by Section 21. The Court found that non-compliance with said section is not fatal.
*   **Alleged frame-up:** Appellants denied the existence of the buy-bust operation and claimed they were framed. The court considered this to be a standard line of defense and gave it little weight, upholding the presumption of regularity.
*   **Conspiracy:** Appellant Henry Concepcion's liability hinged on proving conspiracy with Alfredo. The court found his statement ("*Mura pa yan, direkta kasi kami*") sufficient evidence of participation. This could be argued as circumstantial and potentially ambiguous.
