**Legal Document Summary: *Dr. Salome U. Jorge vs. Carlos P. Diaz, Deputy Sheriff***

**Case:** A.M. No. P-07-2332

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Dr. Salome U. Jorge
*   **Respondent:** Carlos P. Diaz, Deputy Sheriff

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Judgment Debt:** Complainant and her late husband were jointly and severally liable for a judgment debt in Civil Case No. 356 to spouses Antonio and Elena dela Cruz, including principal (P100,000), interest (accruing from January 8, 1993), exemplary damages (P20,000), attorney's fees (P20,000), and costs of the suit.
*   **Garnishment:** Respondent, as Deputy Sheriff, garnished Complainant's bonuses to satisfy the judgment.
*   **Failure to Submit Return:** The central issue is the respondent’s failure to properly and timely submit a return of writ following his garnishment of complainant's mid-year bonus.

**Obligations:**

*   **Deputy Sheriff's Duty:** Respondent had a statutory obligation under Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court to make periodic reports regarding the enforcement of the writ of execution every thirty days to the court, including the proceedings taken and promptly furnishing the parties.
*   **Judgment Debtor's Obligation:** Complainant was obligated to satisfy the judgment debt.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Deputy Sheriff's Liability:** Found guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty for failing to submit a return of the writ.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** While the Court calculated the total debt including interest, the exact interest rate and compounding frequency from 1993 could be subject to further scrutiny and potentially affect the total amount due. *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78, 95-97 details how the obligation is breached and the differing forms of interest.
*   **Payments Made vs. Debt:** Complainant claimed overpayment. However, the court considered the fact that itemized amounts included some checks dated 1995, which could not have been in settlement of the 2003 judgment debt.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 14 of the Rules of Court:** Mandates the return of the writ of execution and periodic reporting obligations of the executing officer.
*   **Rule IV, Section 52 (B) (1) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Prescribes the penalty for simple neglect of duty.
*   **Article 1169 of the Civil Code**: Determines when default occurs.

**Conclusion:**

The Deputy Sheriff was found administratively liable for simple neglect of duty for failing to properly document and report garnishment activities. The Court found the Sheriff’s actions did not result in overpayment of the underlying judgment debt, but his administrative lapse merited suspension.
