**Case:** *Herminio Mariano, Jr. v. Ildefonso C. Callejas and Edgar de Borja* (G.R. No. 166640, July 31, 2009)

**Summary:**

This case concerns a claim for damages arising from the death of Dr. Frelinda Mariano, a passenger on a Celyrosa Express bus owned by Ildefonso Callejas and driven by Edgar de Borja. The bus collided with an Isuzu truck owned by Liong Chio Chang (La Perla Sugar Supply) and driven by Arcadio Arcilla.  The RTC initially found Callejas, De Borja, and Chang jointly and severally liable to Mariano for breach of contract of carriage. The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC decision, absolving Callejas and De Borja.  The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, denying Mariano's petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 1733, Civil Code:**  Common carriers are bound to observe extraordinary diligence for passenger safety.
*   **Art. 1755, Civil Code:** Common carriers must carry passengers safely as far as human care and foresight can provide, using utmost diligence.
*   **Art. 1756, Civil Code:**  In case of passenger death or injury, common carriers are presumed negligent.
*   **Duty of Extraordinary Diligence:**  Celyrosa Express, as a common carrier, has a duty to transport passengers safely using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons, per Art. 1755, Civil Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial RTC Ruling:**  Callejas (owner), De Borja (driver), and Chang (truck owner) were held jointly and severally liable for damages.
*   **Appellate Court & Supreme Court Ruling:** Callejas and De Borja are *not* liable. The proximate cause of the accident was determined to be the negligence of the truck driver.
* **Driver of Isuzu truck:** Was convicted of reckless imprudence resulting to homicide, multiple slight physical injuries and damage to property.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Presumption of Negligence (Art. 1756):** The initial presumption of negligence against the common carrier existed, potentially exposing them to liability. However, the respondents successfully rebutted this presumption.
*   **Causation:**  The central issue revolved around proximate cause.  The respondents successfully argued that the truck driver's negligence (faulty brakes, speeding, swerving) was the sole proximate cause of the accident, not any negligence on their part.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Pilapil v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 52159, December 22, 1989, 180 SCRA 546):**  This case clarifies that while common carriers have a high duty of care, they are not insurers of absolute safety.  Liability is based on negligence, not strict liability. This was the core jurisprudence relied on by the Court in reversing the lower court decision.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1733, 1755, 1756:**  These articles form the basis of the obligations and presumptions against common carriers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention was whether the respondents successfully demonstrated that they exercised extraordinary diligence and whether the accident was solely due to the negligence of a third party. The factual findings, especially the testimony of PO3 De Villa and the truck driver's guilty plea in the criminal case, proved decisive.
