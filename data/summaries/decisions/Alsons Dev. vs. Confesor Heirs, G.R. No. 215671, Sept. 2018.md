**Case:** *Alsons Development and Investment Corporation vs. Heirs of Romeo D. Confesor*, G.R. No. 215671, September 19, 2018

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA's decision affirming the Office of the President's (OP) order to cancel Industrial Forest Plantation Management Agreement (IFPMA) No. 21 between Alsons Development and Investment Corporation (Alsons) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The Court ruled that the pending action for annulment of title and reversion (Civil Case No. 8374) filed by the Republic against the Heirs of Romeo D. Confesor (Heirs) in the RTC constitutes a prejudicial question.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **IFPMA No. 21:** Leasehold agreement granted to Alsons by DENR for 25 years over a parcel of land.

*   **Heirs' Claim:** The Heirs claim ownership of a portion of the land covered by IFPMA No. 21, based on Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. V-1344 (P-144) P-2252, arguing the DENR lacked jurisdiction to enter the leasehold agreement as the land was private.

*   **Republic's Action (Civil Case No. 8374):**  A pending lawsuit to annul the Heirs' title, alleging it's fake/spurious. The Republic claims the land remains public domain.

*   **Alsons' Argument:** The IFPMA's cancellation depends on the validity of the Heirs' title, which is the subject of Civil Case No. 8374. Resolving Civil Case 8374 is needed to resolve the propriety of the IFPMA.

**Ruling & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court held that the pending Civil Case No. 8374 before the RTC is a prejudicial question.

*   While not strictly a civil-criminal context for prejudicial question, the *ratio decidendi* of avoiding conflicting decisions applies (citing *Abacan, Jr. v. Northwestern University, Inc.*).

*   The court referenced *Quiambao v. Hon. Osorio*, drawing a parallel between administrative and civil cases and the impact on property rights.

*   The court stated: If the RTC declares the Heirs' TCT valid, they can demand cancellation. Conversely, If found fake, then they have no such right. Upholding the validity of the IFPMA does not limit the rights of the heirs to proceed with other claims for damages as may be allowed by law.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Alsons: Remains bound by the terms of IFPMA No. 21, pending the outcome of Civil Case No. 8374.
*   Heirs:  Their ability to enforce any ownership claim is contingent on the RTC's decision in Civil Case No. 8374.
*   RTC (General Santos City, Branch 35): Ordered to proceed with Civil Case No. 8374 with dispatch.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Decisions:** A major risk highlighted by the Court is the potential for conflicting decisions if the IFPMA is cancelled, but the Heirs' title is later invalidated.
*   **Factual Issues:** The Court avoided ruling directly on the validity of the Heirs' title, deferring that to the RTC in Civil Case No. 8374.
*   **Delay:** The litigation is prolonged, dependent on the progress of the Civil Case.
