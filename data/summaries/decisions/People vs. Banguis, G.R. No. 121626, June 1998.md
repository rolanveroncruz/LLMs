**Nature:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Rolando Banguis of rape.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rolando Banguis (Appellant) was charged with rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, with allegations of conspiracy and use of force and intimidation.
*   **Defense:** Appellant pleaded not guilty and presented an alibi, claiming he was elsewhere when the crime occurred.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC found Rolando Banguis and Romel Francisco guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt, sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering them to pay P50,000 in moral damages to the victim, Chelly Caliso.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case hinges heavily on the credibility of the victim's testimony and the weakness of the appellant's alibi and defense witnesses.
*   **Inconsistencies:** The defense attempted to exploit inconsistencies between the victim's affidavit and her testimony, a common defense tactic in rape cases.
*   **Affidavit vs. Testimony:** Court has ruled that affidavits are generally subordinate in importance to open court declarations. People vs. Villanueva, 215 SCRA 22, October 21, 1992.
*   **Minority Defense:** The Supreme Court considered the appellant's age (17) at the time of the offense as a privileged mitigating circumstance.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** The alibi provided was not strong enough to prove it was physically impossible for the appellant to have been at the scene of the crime.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The main argument on appeal was the insufficiency of evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancies in testimony:** Discrepancies between victim's affidavit and testimony regarding who pulled the knife initially was contested.
*   **Witness credibility:** Trial court deemed prosecution witness credible due to her natural, spontaneous and straightforward manner while defendant witnesses were deemed as fabricated and rehearsed.
*   **Alibi defense:** Alibi defense was contested due to the short distance between appellant's location and the crime scene, and conflicting statements in defense's witness testimonies.

**Outcome of Appeal:** The Supreme Court *AFFIRMED* the RTC decision but *MODIFIED* the penalty, taking into account the appellant's minority. The sentence was reduced to 9 years, 4 months and 1 day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum.
