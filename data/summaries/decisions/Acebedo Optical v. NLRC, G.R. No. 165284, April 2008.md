## Legal Document Summary: *MP Acebedo Optical Shops/ Acebedo Optical Co., Inc. v. NLRC and Rodrigo C. Santiago* (G.R. No. 165284)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the NLRC's dismissal of the petitioner's appeal for being filed out of time.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Respondent Rodrigo C. Santiago filed a complaint for illegal dismissal after being terminated by the petitioner, Acebedo Optical.
*   **Labor Arbiter's Decision:** The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of the respondent, ordering reinstatement with backwages.
*   **Appeal Period:**  Article 223 of the Labor Code and Section 1, Rule VI of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure requires appeal to the NLRC within 10 calendar days from receipt of the Labor Arbiter's decision.
*   **Late Appeal:** Acebedo Optical's appeal to the NLRC was filed approximately 11 months after their counsel allegedly received the Labor Arbiter's decision.
*   **Main Issue:** Whether the petitioner's appeal to the NLRC was perfected within the reglementary period.

**Obligations:**

*   Obligation to file appeal with NLRC within 10 calendar days of receiving the Labor Arbiter's decision (Art. 223, Labor Code).
*   Obligation of party-litigants to maintain contact with their counsel and inform themselves of the progress of their case.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is liable for respondent's reinstatement with full backwages from dismissal until actual reinstatement if NLRC decision is affirmed.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Final and Executory Judgment:** Failure to perfect the appeal within the prescribed period renders the Labor Arbiter's decision final and executory, obligating the petitioner to comply with the reinstatement order and payment of backwages.
*   **Loss of Appeal:** The primary risk is the loss of the ability to contest the Labor Arbiter's decision on the merits, regardless of any potential substantive defenses.
*   **Estoppel:** The court may invoke the doctrine of estoppel against a party that fails to exercise due diligence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code:** Governing the appeal period for decisions of the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Section 1, Rule VI of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure:** Reinforces the 10-day appeal period.
*   **Corporate Inn Hotel v. Lizo, G.R. No. 148279:** Reinforces that the right to appeal is a statutory right that must be followed.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The discrepancy in the petitioner's claim that they were unaware of the Labor Arbiter's decision versus the NLRC's record showing their counsel receiving it. This is crucial, as the appeal period is triggered by receipt of the decision.
*   Petitioners claims the court committed grave, palpable, and patent errors in upholding the decision.

**Summary Judgment:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Court of Appeals' decision. The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the statutory appeal period outlined in Article 223 of the Labor Code and Section 1, Rule VI of the NLRC New Rules of Procedure.  The core issue was the late filing of the appeal, which the court found was not excused by the petitioner's claim of lack of knowledge or negligence of their former counsel. This is a significant loss for Acebedo Optical.
