## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System vs. Genaro C. Bautista, et al.* (G.R. No. 171351, March 14, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision ordering MWSS to pay its employees Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) from November 16, 1989, to March 16, 1999.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Entitlement to COLA (1989-1999):** MWSS is *obligated* to pay its employees (incumbent and former) the 95% balance of their COLA from Nov 1989 to March 16, 1999. This obligation arises from the ineffectiveness of DBM Corporate Circular No. 10 (DBM CCC No. 10) due to lack of publication, as established in *De Jesus v. Commission on Audit* (294 SCRA 152) and affirmed in *Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 v. Commission on Audit* (469 SCRA 397). The Court reiterated that COLA during this period was not effectively integrated into standardized salaries and is a legally demandable right.
*   **Agreement on Attorney's Fees & Litigation Expenses:** The agreement between respondent Genaro Bautista and other respondents to segregate ten percent (10%) of the amount payable to each of respondents, as and by way of litigation expenses and attorney's fees, is declared valid and binding, and is based on the special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed by the respondents.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Monetary Liability:** MWSS is liable for significant back payments of COLA, plus potential interest from the finality of the decision until satisfaction.
*   **Enforcement:** Mandamus is a proper remedy to compel MWSS to perform its ministerial duty to pay the COLA balance.
*   **Limited Scope of Attorney's Fees Agreement:** The agreement regarding the 10% deduction for legal fees *only applies* to employees who signed the agreement with Bautista. Other employees who have made similar agreements with other attorneys are bound by their own contracts. *Res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet*.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6758 (Salary Standardization Law):** Addressed, but interpreted in light of *De Jesus* and *PPA Employees*.
*   **De Jesus v. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 109023):** DBM Circular No. 10 declared ineffective due to lack of publication.
*   **Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 v. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 160396):** Affirmed *De Jesus* and clarified the status of COLA during the period of DBM Circular No. 10's ineffectiveness.
*   **Article 1311 of the Civil Code:** The principle of relativity of contracts dictates that only the parties and their successors are bound by the contract.
*   **Article 111 of the Labor Code of the Philippines**

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Identification of "Similarly Situated" Employees:** The ruling extends to "other employees who are similarly situated." The criteria for determining who qualifies as "similarly situated" need to be clearly defined to avoid future disputes.
*   **Attorney's fees/litigation expenses:** The Supreme Court affirmed the 10% agreement as valid only for those respondents who signed it, but any future agreements with other employees who were not part of this case may be subject to dispute.

**Conclusion:**

The document confirms MWSS's obligation to pay the COLA balance from 1989-1999, citing established jurisprudence. The main area for potential risk lies in determining the employees covered by the ruling and in potential disputes regarding any other agreements made between lawyers and employees.
