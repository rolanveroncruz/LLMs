## Legal Document Summary: *Catores v. Afidchao*, G.R. No. 151240 (2009)

**Nature of Document:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which in turn affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment in favor of Mary Afidchao (Respondent) in an *accion publiciana* case against Angeline Catores (Petitioner).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Ownership & Encroachment:** The RTC and CA found that the Petitioner encroached on the Respondent's land, covered by TCT No. T-27839. This was based on survey results from the Bureau of Lands and corroborated by engineers.
*   **Order to Vacate:** The Petitioner was ordered to vacate the encroached portion (approx. 2,138 sq. meters) and remove her improvements (house, etc.).
*   **Title Validity:** The Court emphasizes that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. Petitioner’s defense of a defective technical description is deemed a collateral attack on Respondent's title, impermissible in an *accion publiciana* case.
*   **Ocular Inspection:** The Court acknowledges the validity of the Report from the Clerk of Court after ocular inspection of the disputed property.
*   **No Damages:** The original claim for exemplary damages and attorney's fees was dismissed.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner:** To vacate the portion of land belonging to respondent.
*   **Petitioner:** Remove her house and other structures within 30 days of final judgment, if possible without damaging Respondent's land.
*   **Petitioner:** Cease and desist from disturbing Respondent's ownership and possession.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Subject to eviction and required to remove improvements.
*   **Petitioner:** Liable for costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Litigation:** While this decision appears to be final, the court does not preclude the petitioner from filing an independent legal action for the alteration, correction or modification of TCT No. T-27839.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   ***Accion Publiciana:*** Emphasized as the relevant action for recovery of possession, distinct from *accion reivindicatoria* (ownership) and forcible entry (summary possession).
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Section 48 states that a certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. Section 103 (formerly Section 122 of the Land Registration Act) protects Torrens titles.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Limits the Supreme Court's jurisdiction to errors of law in CA decisions, not factual reviews, with specific exceptions.
*   **Lorenzana Food Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 231 SCRA 713:** Distinguished based on its involvement of a quieting of title action rather than *accion publiciana*. The Supreme Court stresses the importance of identifying property precisely.
*   **Misa v. Court of Appeals, 212 SCRA 217:**  Distinguished based on its involvement of unregistered land and partition proceedings.
*   **De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation, 452 SCRA 564:** Reiterates the principle against collateral attacks on Torrens titles.
*   **Caraan v. Court of Appeals, 474 SCRA 543:** Defines "collateral attack" on a title.
*   **Ybañez v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 194 SCRA 743:** Further explains and affirms the principle against collateral attacks on Torrens titles.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Technical Description Discrepancy:** While the courts acknowledge a potential discrepancy in the technical description of the Respondent's title, they don't deem it sufficient to invalidate the title or warrant dismissal of the case.
*   **Removal of Improvements:** The judgment states that Petitioner must remove her house and other structures provided that the same can be done without damage to the plaintiff's titled land within 30 days from the time this Judgment becomes final and executory. This clause may be contentious, depending on the difficulty and cost of removing the structures without damaging Respondent's property.
* **Integrity of Survey Monuments**: The CA's reliance on the survey monuments for location is problematic, as the petitioner contested their accuracy and reliability.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Petitioner's Options:** While the Supreme Court denied the instant appeal, the petitioner still has the option of pursuing a direct action to correct the alleged errors in the technical description of the title. This might involve challenging the validity of the original survey or the registration decree.
*   **Respondent's Enforcement:** The Respondent can proceed with enforcing the judgment and evicting the Petitioner. However, the Respondent should exercise caution to avoid causing undue damage to Petitioner's property during the removal of the improvements, to mitigate the risk of future legal challenges.
