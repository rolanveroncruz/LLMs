**Case:** *Wilfredo M. Catu vs. Atty. Vicente G. Rellosa*, A.C. No. 5738, February 19, 2008 (569 Phil. 539)

**Summary:** This is a disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Vicente G. Rellosa, a *punong barangay*, for representing defendants (Elizabeth C. Diaz-Catu and Antonio Pastor) in an ejectment case after having presided over conciliation proceedings regarding the same matter in his capacity as *punong barangay*.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Complainant:** Wilfredo M. Catu, co-owner of the property in dispute, filed the complaint against Atty. Rellosa.
*   **Respondent:** Atty. Vicente G. Rellosa, *punong barangay* and lawyer, is found guilty of professional misconduct.
*   **Violation of Lawyer's Oath:** The Court found that Atty. Rellosa violated his oath as a lawyer and Canons 1 and 7 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility by:
    *   Failing to secure prior written permission from the Secretary of Interior and Local Government before appearing as counsel for Elizabeth and Pastor.
    *   Engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, violating civil service rules, and breaching Rule 1.01 of the CPR (unlawful conduct).
    *   Failing to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.
*   **Sanction:** Suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 6.03, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Initially cited by the IBP, but the Supreme Court clarifies this rule applies only to *former* government lawyers.
    *   **PCGG v. Sandiganbayan**, G.R. Nos. 151809-12, 12 April 2005, 455 SCRA 526 (clarifying Rule 6.03).
*   **Section 7(b)(2) of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):** IBP cites this. Court holds Section 90 of RA 7160 applies instead.
*   **Section 90, RA 7160 (Local Government Code of 1992):** Special law regarding practice of profession by elective local officials. Court uses the principle of *Lex specialibus derogat generalibus* holding that this special law governs.
*   **Section 12, Rule XVIII, Revised Civil Service Rules:** Requires written permission from the head of the department to engage in private practice if the official's time is not fully at the disposal of the government. This is the critical provision that Rellosa violated.
*   **Canon 1, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Uphold the Constitution and obey the laws.
*   **Canon 7, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.
*   **Rule 1.01, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Avoid unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Grounds for disbarment/suspension.
*   **Ducat v. Villalon, 392 Phil. 394 (2000):** On public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession.
*   **Ramos v. Rada, A.M. No. P-202, 22 July 1975, 65 SCRA 179; Zeta v. Malinao, A.M. No. P-220, 20 December 1978, 87 SCRA 303.:**  Related to necessity of head of department authorization.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Potential Risks:**

*   The application of Rule 6.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility was initially contentious, but the Supreme Court clarified its inapplicability to incumbent, only to *former*, government lawyers.
*   The interpretation and application of RA 6713 versus RA 7160 were crucial to the outcome. The Court's reliance on *lex specialis* is significant.
*   The key point of contention is whether Atty. Rellosa's actions constituted a conflict of interest, even if not explicitly prohibited by all the initially cited regulations.  While not directly prohibited, his presiding over the conciliation could give the appearance of impropriety and potentially influence his representation of the defendants.

**Legal Precision:**

The Court focuses on the specific violation of Section 12, Rule XVIII of the Revised Civil Service Rules, combined with the lawyer's oath and relevant canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility, to justify the disciplinary action. The decision hinges on the requirement for prior authorization for practicing law while holding a government position.
