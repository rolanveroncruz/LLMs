**Legal Document Summary: *De Leon v. Geronimo*, A.C. No. 10441 (2018)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a disbarment case.

**Parties:**

*   Complainant: Susan T. De Leon (Client)
*   Respondent: Atty. Antonio A. Geronimo (Lawyer)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Engagement:** Atty. Geronimo was engaged by De Leon to represent her in a labor case.
*   **Duty of Diligence & Competence (CPR Canons 17 & 18, Rules 18.03 & 18.04):** Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) require lawyers to diligently represent clients, keep them informed, and respond to inquiries promptly. Specifically, lawyers are expected to maintain at all times a high standard of legal proficiency, and to devote his full attention, skill, and competence to the case, regardless of its importance and whether he accepts it for a fee or for free
*   **Failure to Inform:** Atty. Geronimo failed to inform De Leon about the adverse NLRC Resolution denying her Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **Failure to Appeal:** Atty. Geronimo did not file a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals despite the adverse NLRC ruling.
*   **Abandonment/Withdrawal:** While Atty. Geronimo claims he was relieved of his duties, he failed to formally withdraw as counsel until after the events in question, and continued to take actions on behalf of De Leon like filing the Motion for Reconsideration at the NLRC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Negligence (Violation of CPR Canons 17 & 18):** Atty. Geronimo's failure to inform De Leon and to pursue an appeal constituted negligence and a breach of his fiduciary duty.
*   **Suspension:** Atty. Geronimo was suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months, although the IBP initially recommended only three (3) months.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Malpractice Claims:** This decision could open Atty. Geronimo to a potential malpractice claim by De Leon, seeking damages resulting from the lost labor case appeal.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The disciplinary action will likely damage Atty. Geronimo's professional reputation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The timing and validity of Atty. Geronimo's alleged termination by De Leon are disputed. The Court seemingly discredits Atty. Geronimo's claim that De Leon told him she would get another lawyer and that this relieved him of his duties, as it was contradicted by his subsequent actions of preparing a motion for reconsideration.
*   The Court rejected Atty. Geronimo's assertion that De Leon's alleged lack of funds justified his inaction. His comment "Wala ka naman pera" was construed negatively.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Canons 17 and 18, Rules 18.03 and 18.04, are cited extensively.
*   **Jurisprudence on Negligence:** The Court cites *Ramirez v. Atty. Buhayang-Margallo*, 752 Phil. 473 (2015), to emphasize a lawyer's duty of competence and diligence.  It also cites *Spouses Aranda v. Atty. Elayda*, *The Heirs of Tiburcio F. Ballesteros, Sr. v. Atty. Apiag*, and *Abiero v. Atty. Juanino* to set a precedent for the penalty of 6 month suspension.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the suspension of Atty. Geronimo for failing to diligently represent his client, Ms. De Leon, in a labor case. Atty. Geronimo neglected to inform her of an adverse NLRC ruling and failed to file a timely appeal, thus violating Canons 17 and 18 of the CPR and his fiduciary duty. The court rejected his arguments that De Leonâ€™s lack of funds or indication she may seek another lawyer excused his professional obligations. The case highlights the importance of lawyer-client communication and the lawyer's obligation to diligently pursue a client's interests, irrespective of perceived financial constraints. The ruling serves as a warning to attorneys regarding potential disciplinary actions for negligence and failure to uphold their ethical responsibilities.
