**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Alex Bartolome*, G.R. No. 129054, September 29, 1998

**Summary:** Automatic review of a death penalty conviction by the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City for rape. The accused, Alex Bartolome, was convicted of raping his 16-year-old daughter, Elena Bartolome. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction with modifications on damages.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Crime:** Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659. Specifically, rape committed by a parent against a victim under 18 years of age, a circumstance qualifying the crime for the death penalty.
*   **Penalty:** Death penalty upheld. The Court acknowledged differing views on the constitutionality of the death penalty but deferred to the majority.
*   **Financial Obligations:** Indemnification to the victim increased to P75,000.00 as civil liability ex delicto and P50,000.00 as moral damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused, Alex Bartolome, is liable for the criminal act of rape.
*   He is liable to pay the indemnification and moral damages awarded to the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Issues:**

*   **Consent vs. Coercion:** The primary defense was that the sexual relations were consensual. The Court rejected this, finding that force and intimidation were present, or that even absent those, the moral ascendancy of the father over the daughter substitutes for the required violence.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The defense argued that the delay in reporting the abuse casts doubt on the victim's credibility. The Court countered that such delay is common in rape cases, especially incestuous rape due to fear and dependency on the abuser. Cites *People vs. Gallo*, G.R. No. 124736, January 22, 1998
*   **Constitutionality of Death Penalty:** While the majority upheld the death penalty, the decision notes that four justices maintained their position that R.A. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty. This presents a potential avenue for future appeals or challenges.
*   **Lack of Resistance:** Accused argues the lack of struggle/outcry indicates consent, but the Court emphasizes that resistance is not required when intimidation is present, citing *People vs. Bayani*, G.R. No. 120894, October 3, 1996, 262 SCRA 660, and *People vs. Pada. G.R. No. 117641. September 16, 1996, 261 SCRA 773.
*    **Implied Admission of Guilt:** The victim's claim that the accused asked for forgiveness was interpreted as an implied admission of guilt by the court. Cites *People vs. Taneo*, G.R. No. 117683, January 16, 1998 citing People vs. de Guzman, G.R. No. 117217, December 2, 1996, 265 SCRA 229.
*   **Potential for Executive Clemency:** The decision directs that certified true copies be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of executive clemency under Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.
