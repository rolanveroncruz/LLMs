## Legal Document Summary: *Erwin H. Reyes vs. NLRC, Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., and/or Rotaida Taguibao* (G.R. No. 180551)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to reverse CA resolutions dismissing Reyes's Petition for Certiorari due to procedural defects (failure to properly serve petition). The underlying case is for illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that Reyes was illegally dismissed by Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines (CCBP). The initial Labor Arbiter (LA) decision favoring Reyes was affirmed with modifications by the NLRC, but the SC ultimately reinstated the LA's original decision. CCBP argued that Reyes was a fixed-term employee.
*   **Fixed-Term Employment:** The SC, echoing the LA's findings, determined that CCBP failed to adequately prove Reyes's employment was for a fixed term. No contract was presented, and Taguibao's (HR Manager) affidavit was deemed insufficient. This implicates Art. 279 of the Labor Code on security of tenure.
*   **Backwages (Art. 279, Labor Code):** The NLRC erred in computing backwages only from the date of the complaint's filing, not from the date of illegal dismissal. The SC reinstated the LA's award of full backwages from the date of illegal dismissal (September 15, 2001) up to actual reinstatement (March 1, 2006), citing *Pheschem Industrial Corporation v. Moldez* and *Philippine Industrial Security Agency Corporation v. Dapiton*. The SC rejects the NLRC's rationale that Reyes's delay in filing suit warranted reduced backwages, finding it discriminatory and violative of equal protection.
*   **Reinstatement (Art. 279, Labor Code):** The NLRC wrongly deleted the reinstatement order, arguing "strained relations" and the confidential nature of the Route Salesman position. The SC held that the "strained relations" doctrine must be strictly applied, citing *Quijano v. Mercury Drug Corporation,* and that being a Route Salesman does not make one a confidential employee under the definition established in *San Miguel Corp. Supervisors and Exempt Union v. Laguesma*. The SC highlights that since the employee has already been reinstated, there is no reason to reverse the previous order.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The NLRC's deletion of attorney's fees was reversed. The SC found Reyes entitled to attorney's fees under Article 2208(2) of the Civil Code due to the unjustified and unlawful termination that compelled him to litigate.
*   **Procedural Lapses (Rule 13, Section 11, Revised Rules of Court):** Reyes's initial failure to provide a written explanation for not personally serving the petition on the adverse parties, as required by Rule 13, Section 11, of the Revised Rules of Court, was initially fatal. However, the SC invoked a liberal construction of the rules to prevent injustice, citing *Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. v. Ricafort*, *Fulgencio v. National Labor Relations Commission* and Rule 1, Section 6 of the Revised Rules of Court.
*   **Negligence of Counsel:** The SC excused Reyes's procedural errors due to his former counsel's gross negligence, applying the exception to the general rule that the negligence of counsel binds the client, citing *Escudero v. Dulay*. The negligence resulted in the foreclosure of remedies and effectively deprived Reyes of his day in court.
*   **Prescriptive Period:** The SC confirms the Complaint was filed within the four-year prescriptive period for illegal dismissal cases under Article 1146 of the New Civil Code, citing *Callanta v. Carnation Philippines, Inc.* and *Ramos v. Our Lady of Peace School*.

**Obligations:**

*   **CCBP:** Obligated to reinstate Reyes to his former position or a substantially equivalent one.
*   **CCBP:** Obligated to pay Reyes full backwages from September 15, 2001, to March 1, 2006, inclusive of allowances and benefits.
*   **CCBP:** Obligated to pay Reyes attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total judgment sum.

**Liabilities:**

*   CCBP is liable for illegally dismissing Reyes.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Implementation Issues:**  Calculation of backwages and benefits may be complex and lead to further disputes during the implementation phase.
*   **Future Litigation:** While the core issue is resolved, future disputes regarding the specific terms and conditions of reinstatement are possible.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Art. 279 (Security of Tenure)
*   **Civil Code:** Art. 2208(2) (Attorney's Fees)
*   **Revised Rules of Court:** Rule 13, Section 11 (Service of Pleadings); Rule 1, Section 6 (Liberal Construction of Rules)
*   **Case Law:** *Pheschem Industrial Corporation v. Moldez*, *Philippine Industrial Security Agency Corporation v. Dapiton*, *Quijano v. Mercury Drug Corporation*, *San Miguel Corp. Supervisors and Exempt Union v. Laguesma*, *Solar Team Entertainment, Inc. v. Ricafort*, *Fulgencio v. National Labor Relations Commission*, *Escudero v. Dulay*, *Callanta v. Carnation Philippines, Inc.*, *Ramos v. Our Lady of Peace School*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The computation of backwages might be a source of contention, requiring careful documentation and potential further clarification from the Labor Arbiter.
*   The definition of "substantially equivalent position" in the reinstatement order could lead to disagreement.
