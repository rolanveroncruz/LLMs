**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Willy Manalili y Bolisay and Danilo Reyes y Mamnila, G.R. No. 121671, August 14, 1998 (355 Phil. 652)

**Summary for Legal Counsel**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision on appeal, modifying the lower court's judgment in a criminal case involving attempted robbery, multiple murder, and frustrated murder.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Constitutional Right to Information:**  The accused have a constitutional right to be informed of the nature of the charges against them before trial. Conviction requires the offense to be charged or necessarily included in the information. *US v. Karelsen, Santos v. People.*
*   **Duplicitous Information and Waiver:** An accused who fails to object to a duplicitous information before arraignment waives the objection and may be convicted of any or all crimes alleged and proven. *People v. Conte, People v. Ferrer*.
*   **Appeal Opens Case for Review:** Appeal from a conviction for a capital offense opens the whole case for review, allowing the appellate court to correct errors even if unassigned. *People v. Sol, People v. Llaguno*.
*   **Attempted Robbery and Lack of Consummation:** Appellants were convicted of attempted robbery (Crim. Case No. 21-1156). While a prosecution witness saw one of the malefactors take money from a woman passenger, the said victim never took the witness stand. In any event, appellants cannot be held liable for consummated robbery, for the said Information merely charged them with attempted robbery.
*   **Multiple Murder Conviction (Crim. Case No. 21-1157):** Appellants were found guilty as principals in the double murder of Alfredo Tango and Sonny Quintua, attended by treachery.  *People v. Maalat* Sentenced to two terms of *reclusion perpetua*. *People v. Legaspi*

    *   **Treachery:** Treachery exists because the means employed gave the victims no opportunity to defend themselves and the means were deliberately adopted by the accused without danger to themselves. The shootings of the victims by Danilo Reyes were sudden and unprovoked.
    *   **Evident Premeditation:** Not proven because evidence to the crime itself, of the following elements: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the offender clung to his or her determination; and (3) a lapse of time between the determination and the execution sufficient to allow the offender to reflect upon the consequences of the act
*   **Acquittal on Frustrated Murder (Crim. Case No. 21-1158):** Insufficient evidence to convict on the charge of multiple frustrated murder. The prosecution presented little to no evidence of the gravity of the wounds allegedly sustained, or to the fact that they were sustained at all during said event.
*   **Rejection of Alibi:** The defense of alibi was rejected due to positive identification by prosecution witnesses. *People v. Vasquez*.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellants are jointly and severally liable for P50,000 in civil indemnity to the heirs of each victim (Alfredo Tango and Sonny Quintua).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Double Murder:** Conviction for double murder carries significant penal liability.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Duplicity of Charges:** Potential for claims regarding the duplicity of charging multiple offenses in a single information which has been deemed waived because the defense did not object prior to arraignment.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Articles 6, 294, 296, 297 (attempted robbery, robbery, complex crime of attempted robbery with homicide)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rules 110, 117, and 120 (criminal procedure)
* Act No. 4103, Section 2 (The Indeterminate Sentence Law)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* The ruling does not contain any ambiguous or contentious clauses. The court provides clear reasoning for its holdings based on the established facts and precedent.
