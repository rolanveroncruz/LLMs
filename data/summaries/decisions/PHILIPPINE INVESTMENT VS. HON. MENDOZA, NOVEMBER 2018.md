**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-18-2538**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Judge Bernabe B. Mendoza for Gross Ignorance of the Law and Knowingly Rendering an Unjust Judgment.

**Complainant:** Philippine Investment Two (SPV-AMC), Incorporated (PI TWO)

**Respondent:** Judge Bernabe B. Mendoza, RTC, Roxas, Isabela

**Factual Background:**

*   PI TWO, an SPV under RA 9182, acquired property covered by TCT No. T-374946.
*   PI TWO obtained a Writ of Possession.
*   Heirs of Wilson Nuesa filed a Quieting of Title case challenging PI TWO's title.
*   Judge Mendoza issued a 72-hour TRO, extended it, and granted a motion to substitute a bond, all allegedly with procedural irregularities.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 58, Sections 4 & 5, Rules of Court:** Governs the issuance of Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) and Preliminary Injunctions.  Mandates service of summons, summary hearings, and limits the duration of TROs.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 20-95:** Special Rules for TROs and Preliminary Injunctions, reiterating the 72-hour/20-day limits and requirements for summary hearings.
*   **RA 9182 (Special Purpose Vehicle Act of 2002):** Establishes PI TWO as a legal entity with specific powers.

**Alleged Breaches & Liabilities:**

*   **Improper Issuance and Extension of TRO:** Judge Mendoza allegedly failed to properly serve summons, conduct a summary hearing within the required 72-hour period, and extended the TRO beyond the permissible 20-day limit.
*   **Granting Motion to Substitute Bond without Hearing:**  Procedural lapse by granting a motion before the scheduled hearing.
*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law:** Failure to adhere to basic rules and jurisprudence regarding TROs and preliminary injunctions.
*    **Section 8(9), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Classifies gross ignorance as a serious charge with a penalty of dismissal, suspension, or a fine.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The Heirs of Nuesa challenged PI TWO's title. If their Quieting of Title case succeeds, PI TWO could lose the subject property, potentially leading to financial loss.
*   Judge Mendoza's defense of "honest belief" is insufficient. He failed to understand the application of law.

*   **RA 9182:** Special Purpose Vehicle Act of 2002.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 58, Sections 4 & 5:** Requirements for TROs and preliminary injunctions.
