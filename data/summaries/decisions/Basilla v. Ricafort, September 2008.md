**Legal Document Summary**

**Case:** *Judge Henry B. Basilla v. Yolanda L. Ricafort* (A.M. No. P-06-2233, Sept. 26, 2008, 588 Phil. 110)

**Nature:** Administrative matter regarding dishonesty.

**Parties:**
*   Complainant: Judge Henry B. Basilla, RTC Branch 3, Legazpi City.
*   Respondent: Yolanda L. Ricafort, former Legal Researcher, RTC Branch 3, Legazpi City.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Dishonesty/Serious Misconduct - Respondent punched out the bundy card of her brother, a Clerk III, to falsely reflect his presence at work. This occurred at least twice (July 15, 2005, and previously on October 26, 2004).
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Initially claimed she was uncertain of her brother's whereabouts, and later claimed she mistakenly punched his card; multiple inconsistent explanations.
*   **Evidence:** Eyewitness testimony contradicted the respondent's explanations. Respondent admitted to the act.
*   **Investigating Judge Findings:** The investigation concluded that respondent intentionally punched the card. Act violates Supreme Court Memorandum Order No. 49-2003 re: Bundy clocks and constitutes dishonesty.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Guilty of dishonesty. Considering 40 years of service, suspension recommended but ultimately not possible due to retirement.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the finding of guilt for dishonesty. Imposed a fine instead of suspension due to respondent's retirement.

**Obligations:**

*   Court personnel have an obligation to uphold honesty and integrity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent Ricafort found liable for dishonesty.
*   A fine of Php 20,000.00 was imposed, to be deducted from retirement benefits.  (The OCA originally recommended Php 30,000).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The respondent's long service (40 years) was considered a mitigating factor in determining the penalty, but the gravity of the offense warranted a financial penalty nonetheless.
*   **Inconsistent Statements:** The inconsistent statements made by the respondent proved fatal to her defense.
*   **Impact of Retirement:** The fact of retirement impacted the penalty imposed, shifting it from suspension to a fine.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 52(A)(1) of the Revised Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases of the Civil Service:** Classifies dishonesty as a grave offense punishable by dismissal.
*   **Sec. 53(j) of the Revised Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases of the Civil Service:** Length of service as a mitigating circumstance.
*   **Supreme Court Memorandum Order No. 49-2003:** Enjoins the use of bundy clocks in all Courts.
*   **Aquino vs. The General Manager of GSIS, 133 Phil. 492, as reiterated in Sevilla vs. Gocon, 423 SCRA 98:** Definition of dishonesty.
*   **Romero v. Castillano, A.M. No. P-93-960, November 18, 2002, 392 SCRA 1:** Example of gross dishonesty and grave misconduct by a court employee.
*   **Philippine Law Dictionary, by Federico B. Moreno:** Definition of dishonesty
**Legal Strategy Considerations**

*   Defense would need to argue against factual determination of intentional dishonesty to negate any administrative liability.
*   The amount of the fine is a point that could have been argued by the respondent since the OCA originally recommended Php 30,000 and SC opted to impose a Php 20,000 fine only.
