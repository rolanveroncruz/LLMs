**Legal Document Summary: GSIS vs. City Treasurer and City Assessor of Manila (G.R. No. 186242)**

**Case Overview:**

This case involves a petition by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) against the City Treasurer and City Assessor of Manila, seeking to nullify real property tax assessments on two properties: the Katigbak property (leased to Manila Hotel Corporation or MHC) and the Concepcion-Arroceros property (occupied by GSIS and a Metropolitan Trial Court). The City of Manila assessed unpaid real property taxes from 1992 to 2002. The RTC dismissed GSIS's petition, upholding the validity of the assessments. The Supreme Court reversed in part.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Tax Exemption:**
    *   GSIS was initially tax-exempt under Presidential Decree (PD) 1146.
    *   The Local Government Code (LGC), Republic Act (RA) 7160, effective January 1, 1992, withdrew this exemption based on Sections 193 and 234, mirroring the holding in *Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos*.
    *   RA 8291 (GSIS Act of 1997) restored the tax exemption under Section 39, effective June 24, 1997. Section 39 also includes a provision considering as paid "any assessment against the GSIS as of the approval of this Act."
    * The Supreme Court held, based on *Manila International Airport Authority v. Court of Appeals,* that GSIS is an instrumentality of the national government, similar to MIAA, rather than a GOCC and the subject properties under GSIS's name are owned by the Republic making GSIS a mere trustee of the subject properties.

*   **Beneficial Use Doctrine & Lease to MHC:**
    *   The Katigbak property is subject to the "beneficial use" principle under Section 234(a) of the LGC. This principle states that property owned by the Republic is not tax-exempt if its beneficial use is granted, for consideration, to a taxable person.
    *   Since GSIS leased the Katigbak property to Manila Hotel Corporation (MHC), a taxable entity, the Katigbak property is subject to real property tax.
    *   MHC is liable for the real property taxes on the Katigbak property under *Testate Estate of Concordia T. Lim*, *Manila Electric Company v. Barlis* and *Republic v. City of Kidapawan* and also contractually obligated to pay based on Stipulation 18 of the Lease Agreement.

*   **Exemption from Levy:**
    *   Despite potential tax liability on the Katigbak property, RA 8291, Section 39, explicitly exempts GSIS properties from attachment, garnishment, execution, levy, or other legal processes. This applies even to the leased Katigbak property, meaning it cannot be sold at a public auction sale.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **MHC:**  Liable for real property taxes on the Katigbak property from 1992-2002 due to beneficial use, pursuant to Section 234(a) of the LGC and Stipulation 18 of the Lease Agreement.
*   **City of Manila:**  Restrained from levying or selling GSIS properties (including Katigbak) at public auction. Must pursue tax collection from MHC via other legal means.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement Against MHC:** The City of Manila needs to ensure that MHC is properly served with the assessment and takes the appropriate steps to pursue the claim against MHC.
*   **Future Tax Law Changes:** While RA 8291 attempts to protect the tax exemption, future legislation could expressly revoke or amend it, potentially subjecting GSIS properties to taxation. Any future legislative changes would need to meet the stringent conditions set forth in Section 39 of RA 8291, which would require the repealing clause must expressly, specifically, and categorically revoke or repeal Sec. 39; and a provision is enacted to substitute or replace the exemption referred to herein as an essential factor to maintain or protect the solvency of the fund.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Commonwealth Act (CA) 186:** GSIS's original charter.
*   **Presidential Decree (PD) 1146:** Revised GSIS charter.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 7160 (Local Government Code):** Sections 133, 193, and 234.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 8291 (GSIS Act of 1997):** Section 39.
*   *Mactan Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos, G.R. No. 120082*
*   *City of Davao v. RTC, Branch XII, Davao City, G.R. No. 127383*
*   *Manila International Airport Authority v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 155650*
*   *Testate Estate of Concordia T. Lim*
*   *Manila Electric Company v. Barlis, G.R. No. 114231*
*   *Republic v. City of Kidapawan, G.R. No. 166651*
*   **Corporation Code, Sec. 87:**
*   **Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended)**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1455**
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 48**

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of GSIS by reversing the RTC's decision. GSIS is generally tax-exempt as an instrumentality of the national government, which is codified in RA 8291, except regarding real property taxes for the Katigbak property where those taxes would be assessed to Manila Hotel Corporation as the taxable beneficial user of the property.
