**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Rashid Binasing y Disalungan*, G.R. No. 221439 (2018)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Rashid Binasing of violating Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs). The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to non-compliance with the procedural safeguards under Section 21 of RA 9165 and conflicting testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Accused was charged with selling 0.03 grams of *shabu* in a buy-bust operation.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** The core issue revolves around the apprehending team's failure to comply with Section 21's requirements for preserving the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs. This section dictates that inventory and photographing of seized items must occur immediately after seizure and confiscation, *in the presence of the accused (or their representative), an elected public official, and a representative from the National Prosecution Service or the media*.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:**
    *   The physical inventory, marking, and photographing of the seized items were *not* done in the presence of insulating witnesses (elected public official and representative from the National Prosecution Service or media) as mandated by RA 9165.
    *   The prosecution failed to provide a *justifiable explanation* for the lack of compliance, which is necessary to excuse non-compliance under the proviso to Section 21.
*   **Conflicting Testimonies:**
    *   **Place of Inventory:** SPO3 Payla testified inventory and marking occurred at the police office, while SPO1 Sabaldana stated it happened at the accused's residence. This discrepancy affects the credibility of the chain of custody.
    *   **Pre-arranged Signal:** Discrepancies existed between SPO1 Sabaldana and PI Labor regarding the pre-arranged signal from the CI.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The primary law governing the case.  Specifically, Section 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and Section 21 (custody and disposition of confiscated drugs).
*   **RA 10640:** The amendment to Section 21 of RA 9165, further strengthening the requirements.
*   ***People v. Jaafar, G.R. No. 219829, January 18, 2017, 815 SCRA 19, 33****:* Cited regarding non-compliance with Section 21 creating reasonable doubt.
*   ***People v. Bintaib, G.R. No. 217805, April 2, 2018****: Cited regarding the purpose of insulating witnesses to deter possible planting of evidence.
*   ***People v. Geronimo, G.R. No. 225500, September 11, 2017****: Cited regarding the requirements for the prosecution to explain reasons behind procedural lapses and that the integrity and value of the seized evidence had nonetheless been preserved.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Integrity of *Corpus Delicti*:** The lack of compliance with Section 21 and the conflicting testimonies raised doubts about the integrity of the *corpus delicti* (the seized drugs). The Court emphasized that the prosecution failed to demonstrate that the substance presented in court was the same substance seized from the accused.
*   **Planting of Evidence:** The Court emphasized that the insulating witnesses are important to deter possible planting of evidence.
*   **Justifiable Ground for Non-Compliance:** The failure to offer a justifiable explanation for the non-compliance with Section 21 was fatal to the prosecution's case. The Court held that the prosecution had the burden of explaining the reasons behind the lapses, and the Court could not presume these grounds.
*   **Safety Concerns:**  The police's claim of "Muslim area" being unsafe as justification is weak and could raise issues of profiling.

**Conclusion:**

The prosecution's failure to adhere to the strict requirements of Section 21, coupled with conflicting testimonies regarding material facts, resulted in a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and the accused's acquittal. The ruling underscores the critical importance of meticulous adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases.
