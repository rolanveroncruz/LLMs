Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *People v. Ubungen*, G.R. No. 225497, focusing on the critical aspects for a legal professional.

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Marciano Ubungen y Pulido*
**G.R. No.:** 225497
**Date:** July 23, 2018
**Ponente:** Martires, J.
**Holding:**  Accused-Appellant Marciano Ubungen was ACQUITTED for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) due to failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, specifically regarding the Chain of Custody of the seized drug. The Court REVERSED the Court of Appeals' decision which had affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs â€“ specifically, methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu").
*   **Core Issue:** The prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, thus failing to establish the *corpus delicti* beyond reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized that in drug cases, establishing an unbroken chain of custody is essential.
*   **Elements of Illegal Sale:** The Court reiterates the elements necessary for a conviction under Sec. 5, Art. II of RA 9165: (1) Identity of the buyer and seller, object of sale, and consideration; (2) Delivery of the thing sold and payment. Critical is proving the accused peddled illicit drugs and presenting the *corpus delicti* in court.
*   **Chain of Custody (Critical Deficiency):** The Court emphasizes the necessity of establishing every link in the chain of custody to ensure the integrity and identity of the seized drugs. Citing precedent, the Court lays out the links that must be established. Prosecution failed in multiple links.

**Chain of Custody Lapses (Critical Deficiencies):**
*   **Second Link (Investigating Officer):** The prosecution failed to show the transfer of the seized drug from the arresting officer (PO1 Abubo) to the investigating officer.  Testimony was silent on the identity of the investigating officer and whether the item was transmitted to one. The Certificate of Inventory and Request for Laboratory Examination lacked crucial recipient information, creating uncertainty in custody. Even assuming PSI Rebujio as the IO, there was no evidence presented regarding how PSI Rebujio handled the item.
*   **Third Link (Forensic Chemist):** A material inconsistency existed between the marking made by PO1 Abubo on the sachet ("JA") and the marking recorded in the Chemistry Report ("A JA"). The prosecution failed to explain this discrepancy, creating reasonable doubt as to whether the sachet tested was the same one seized.
*   **Fourth Link (Court Presentation):** The forensic chemist's testimony was dispensed with via stipulation, but the stipulation failed to include the necessary agreements outlined in *People v. Pajarin*, 654 Phil. 461 (2011), specifically that the chemist would have testified to precautionary steps taken to preserve the item's integrity. The stipulation failed to cover the handling of the specimen before and after the possession of the forensic chemist.

**Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** The primary statute under which Ubungen was charged (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21, Article II:** The provision concerning the chain of custody rule, although not explicitly mentioned in the body, its essence is discussed and used as basis of the ruling.

**Case Law:**

*   **People v. Alberto, 625 Phil. 545, 554 (2010):** Outlines the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **People vs. Chua Tan Lee, 457 Phil. 443, 449 (2003):** Highlighted the importance of the corpus delicti.
*   **People v. Ismael, G.R. No. 208093, 20 February 2017:** Defines the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Nandi, 639 Phil. 134, 144-145 (2010):** Illustrates the specific links that should be established in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Pajarin, 654 Phil. 461 (2011):** Sets out the necessary stipulations when dispensing with the testimony of a forensic chemist.
*   **People v. Sanchez, 590 Phil. 214, 237-238 (2008):** Case law on the stipulations that refer to the handling of the specimen.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Stipulation Deficiencies:** The failure to ensure proper stipulations when waiving the forensic chemist's testimony creates a significant risk. The *Pajarin* requirements are critical.
*   **Inconsistent Marking:** The discrepancy in the markings on the seized item raises serious doubts about the evidence's integrity. The prosecution's silence on this point is a weakness.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** The absence of clear documentation showing the transfer of custody between law enforcement personnel is a recurring problem in drug cases and a potential ground for acquittal.

**Summary for Litigation or Case Assessment:**

This case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of meticulous adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases under R.A. 9165. The prosecution's failure to document and account for each transfer of the seized drugs, compounded by the inconsistent markings and deficient stipulations, fatally undermined their case.  Defense counsel should scrutinize the chain of custody evidence for similar lapses, particularly regarding the investigating officer and forensic chemist links. This case highlights the potential for acquittal where procedural safeguards are not strictly observed, reinforcing the constitutional presumption of innocence.
