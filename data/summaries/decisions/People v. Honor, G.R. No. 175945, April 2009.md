## Legal Document Summary: People v. Honor, G.R. No. 175945

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for two counts of Murder.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellants Lolito Honor and Alberto Garjas were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of Murder (Article 248, RPC) for the deaths of Nestor Nodalo and Henry Argallon. The RTC acquitted them of Frustrated Murder.
*   **Treachery:** The killings were qualified by treachery, as the victims were unarmed and suddenly attacked, preventing self-defense (People v. Sades).
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The Court gave credence to the testimony of the prosecution eyewitness, Rey Panlubasan, citing the trial court's superior position to assess witness credibility (People v. Malejana). Minor inconsistencies were deemed badges of truth.
*   **Defense:** The defense of alibi and denial was deemed weak and insufficient to overcome positive identification (People v. Sades).
*   **Conspiracy:** The actions of all accused contributed to the commission of the crime (People v. Honor).
*   **Damages:** The Supreme Court imposed joint and several liability on the appellants for civil indemnity *ex delicto* (P75,000) and moral damages (P50,000) for each victim, plus legal interest from the date of the decision.

**Obligations:**

*   **Appellants:** Serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count of murder. Jointly and severally liable for paying civil indemnity *ex delicto* and moral damages to the heirs of each victim (Nestor Nodalo and Henry Argallon), plus interest.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for two counts of Murder.
*   Civil liability for civil indemnity ex delicto of P75,000.00 and moral damages of P50,000.00 to the heirs of both victims.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Duplicity of Offense:** The Information charged two offenses of murder in a single information, a violation of Sec. 13, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court. The Supreme Court ruled that the accused waived their right to be tried for only one crime, one information, pursuant to Sec. 9, Rule 117 due to their failure to file a motion to quash before pleading.
*   **Increased Penalty on Appeal:** The Supreme Court increased the penalty to two counts of murder upon appeal.
*   **Credibility Assessment:** Weight given to the testimony of a single eyewitness (Rey Panlubasan), despite claims of inconsistencies.
