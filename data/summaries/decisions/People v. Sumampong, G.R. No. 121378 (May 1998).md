## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sumampong*, G.R. No. 121378 (1998)

This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the conviction of Ronald Sumampong, Donald Te, and Jovy Orello for the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code. Aurelio Rivas remains at large.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, allegedly committed on February 25, 1992.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found the accused acted in conspiracy based on their conduct before, during, and after the commission of the crime, demonstrating a common purpose and design.
*   **Evidence:** Conviction primarily based on the victim's testimony and the medico-legal officer's findings of spermatozoa in her vagina, despite no external signs of violence.
*   **Defense:** Accused presented alibi, which the court rejected as weak and insufficient to overcome the positive identification by the victim.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Ronald Sumampong and Donald Te:** Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua* and ordered to pay P50,000.00 each as indemnity and P50,000.00 each as moral damages. The SC deleted the award of moral damages for want of legal and factual basis.
*   **Jovy Orello (minor):** Given the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *Prision Mayor* to 14 years and 8 months and 1 day of *Reclusion Temporal*, and ordered to pay P50,000.00 as indemnity.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** By finding a conspiracy, the act of one accused is the act of all, making them jointly liable for the damages.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Victim's Testimony:** The defense challenged the victim's narrative, particularly regarding the existence of the second story in Rivas' house. The court addressed this, highlighting the trial court's ocular inspection findings and witness testimony confirming its existence at the time of the crime.
*   **Alibi as Defense:** The reliance on alibi as the sole defense is inherently weak. *People v. Alcantara, 254 SCRA 384 (1996)* and *People v. Ligotan, 262 SCRA 602 (1996)* were cited to show the standard required for alibi to be credible.
*   **Conspiracy:** The finding of conspiracy hinges on the circumstantial evidence of the accused's actions. The ruling cites *People v. Bergonia, et al., G.R. No. 89369, June 9, 1997* and *People v. Gundran, 228 SCRA 583 (1993)* to support its finding and legal consequences.
*   **Lack of External Injuries:** The absence of external signs of violence was a potential weakness in the prosecution's case, but the court gave weight to the presence of spermatozoa as proof of penetration, combined with the victim's testimony.
*   **Moral Damages:** The Supreme Court deleted the award of moral damages, meaning the lower court made an error in this decision

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes the crime of rape.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape based on the victim's testimony, physical evidence of spermatozoa, and the finding of conspiracy among the accused. The deletion of the moral damages shows that the lower court was not entirely correct in its decision. The alibi defense was deemed insufficient, highlighting the importance of overcoming positive identification by the victim.
