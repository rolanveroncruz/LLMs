## Legal Document Summary: People v. Perez, G.R. No. 189303

**Nature:** Resolution affirming a Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Felix Casas Perez guilty of two counts of simple rape of his daughter, AAA. The CA downgraded the charges from qualified rape due to the Information's omission of AAA's age.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Affirmation of Guilt:** Perez found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two counts of simple rape under Article of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua for each count of rape.
*   **Monetary Damages:** Perez ordered to pay AAA for each rape count:
    *   P50,000 civil indemnity ex delicto
    *   P50,000 moral damages
    *   P30,000 exemplary damages
*   **Costs:** Perez bears the costs of the suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape, resulting in imprisonment.
*   Financial liability for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appellate Review:** While the Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, further appeal avenues may be explored, though unlikely to succeed.
*   **Enforcement of Damages:** Enforcing payment of the awarded damages may present practical challenges.
*   **Information's Omission:** The initial charge of qualified rape failed due to the absence of the victim's age in the information. Future prosecutions must ensure proper drafting to avoid similar issues.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code:** Impliedly refers to the provisions defining rape and its penalties.
*   **People v. Mallari, G.R. No. 179051:** Cited for the award of civil indemnity ex delicto and moral damages.
*   **People v. Abellera, G.R. No. 166617:** Cited for the award of exemplary damages.
*   **Criminal Procedure:** Relevant rules on information drafting (specifically the inclusion of all essential elements of the crime) impacted the initial charge of qualified rape.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The resolution itself contains no ambiguity. However, the downgrade from qualified rape due to the omission in the Information raises a potential contentious point regarding prosecutorial diligence and the impact on sentencing. The initial RTC decision sentenced the defendant to death which was later revised to life imprisonment.
*  The ambiguity lies in the lack of age of the offended party in the information, causing a huge shift from a higher crime to a lesser one.
