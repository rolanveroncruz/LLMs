## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Carullo*, G.R. No. 82351, April 24, 1998 (352 Phil. 315)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court decision finding Romulo Carullo and Jose Taule guilty of robbery with homicide and sentencing them to three penalties of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Confessions:** The Court *affirms* the trial court's decision but *reverses* the trial court's reliance on extrajudicial confessions by the accused. The Court held the confessions inadmissible because they were obtained without the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation, violating *Morales v. Enrile* (121 SCRA 538 (1983)) and *People v. Galit* (135 SCRA 465 (1985)). The Court emphasizes that this rule applies even though the case occured prior to the 1987 constitution because *Morales* had already been decided.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The Court *affirms* the trial court's reliance on the eyewitness testimony of Aileen Maclang, a child witness. The Court rejected the appellant's arguments that due to her age (4 at the time of the incident, 6 at trial), the testimony should not be deemed credible.
*   **Alibi:** The Court rejected the defense of alibi presented by both accused, finding that they failed to establish that they were so far from the scene of the crime that they could not have committed it (*People v. Pija*, 245 SCRA 80 (1995)). The Court also stated that alibi is a weak defense and should not be held against positive identification of the accused.
*   **Robbery with Homicide:** The Court found the accused guilty of robbery with homicide, defined under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code. The Court found that all the elements of robbery were present (personal property belonging to another, was unlawfully taken, with intent to gain, and with the use of force upon things) and that the killing was committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The court found the presence of treachery, dwelling and rape which would have required the imposition of the death penalty. However, in view of the 1987 Constitution, which suspended the imposition of the death penalty, the only penalty which could be imposed was *reclusion perpetua*.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused found guilty of robbery with homicide.
*   Each sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (modified from three penalties).
*   Jointly and severally liable to indemnify the heirs of the victim, Carolina Coronel, for P50,000 (increased from P30,000 by the appellate court).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Child Witness Credibility:** The reliance on the testimony of a child witness, while upheld here, could be challenged based on capacity for accurate perception, recall, and truthful narration.
*   **Application of *Morales v. Enrile*:** The application of *Morales v. Enrile* retroactively is a key point.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The Court recognized treachery, dwelling and rape as aggravating circumstances which would have imposed the death penalty had it not been suspended.
