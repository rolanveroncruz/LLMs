**Legal Document Summary: SEC vs. GMA Network, Inc. (G.R. No. 164026)**

**Core Issue:** Validity of SEC's assessed filing fee for GMA Network, Inc.'s (GMA) application to extend its corporate term.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that SEC Memorandum Circular No. 2, Series of 1994, used to assess the filing fee, is invalid due to lack of publication in the Official Gazette or a newspaper of general circulation, and failure to file with the National Administrative Register as required by EO 200 and the Administrative Code of 1987.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3531:** Amends Corporation Law, stating the SEC collects the same fees for filing original articles of incorporation as for amendments extending corporate term.  This is the underlying statutory authority for the SEC's fee collection.
*   **SEC Memorandum Circular No. 1, Series of 1986:** Sets a lower filing fee (1/10 of 1% of authorized capital stock, but not less than P300.00 nor more than P100,000.00) for amended articles extending corporate life.
*   **SEC Memorandum Circular No. 2, Series of 1994:** Imposes new fees (1/10 of 1% of authorized capital stock plus 20% thereof, but not less than P500.00) for the filing of articles of incorporation; deletes maximum cap in Circular 1. This is the contentious Circular.
*   **Executive Order No. 200:** Requires publication of laws (including administrative rules implementing a law) in the Official Gazette or a newspaper of general circulation for effectivity.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292):** Requires filing of agency rules with the University of the Philippines Law Center (National Administrative Register).

**Obligations:**

*   SEC is obligated to comply with publication and filing requirements for administrative rules that affect the public.

**Liabilities:**

*   SEC is potentially liable for improperly assessed fees based on an invalid memorandum circular.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Future challenges to other SEC regulations based on similar procedural deficiencies (lack of publication/filing).
*   Disruptions to the SEC's fee collection process.

**Case Law:**

*   **Ta√±ada v. Tuvera (230 Phil. 528 (1986)):** Establishes the publication requirement for laws and administrative rules.  Specifically requires publication of administrative rules and regulations if their purpose is to enforce or implement existing law pursuant also to a valid delegation.
*   **Philsa International Placement and Services Corp. v. Secretary of Labor and Employment (408 Phil. 270 (2001)):**  Cited to underscore the importance of publishing or filing rules with the National Administrative Register
*   **National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms (NASECORE) v. Energy Regulatory Commission, G.R. No. 163935, February 2, 2006, 481 SCRA 480, 520.**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Nature of MC No. 2, Series of 1994:** SEC argued it was merely interpretative and thus did not require publication. The Court rejected this, holding it was implementary and affected the public.
*   **Reasonableness of the Fee:** The court highlighted that the assessment of P1,212,200.00 was exceedingly unreasonable and amounts to an imposition.

**Legal Precision Points:**

*   The Court distinguishes between interpretative rules (not requiring publication) and implementary rules (requiring publication and filing).
*   The SEC's delegated legislative power to fix fees is acknowledged but must be exercised reasonably and within the bounds of due process.
*   R.A. 3531 provides a clear directive for fee structure, but the procedural flaw of non-publication overrides this substantive authority.

**Note:**  The ruling does not question the SEC's overall authority to collect fees, but specifically addresses the validity of the particular memorandum circular used to assess the fees in this case.  The SEC must ensure future regulations are properly published and filed.
