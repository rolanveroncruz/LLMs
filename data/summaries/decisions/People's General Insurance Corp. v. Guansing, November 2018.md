**Case:** *People's General Insurance Corporation vs. Edgardo Guansing and Eduardo Lizaso* (G.R. No. 204759, November 14, 2018)

**Issue:** Did the Regional Trial Court (RTC) acquire jurisdiction over respondent Edgardo Guansing (Guansing) through service of summons or voluntary appearance?

**Facts:**

*   People's General Insurance Corp. (PGIC) paid its insured, Yokohama, for damages caused by Guansing's employee (Lizaso).
*   PGIC, as subrogee, sued Guansing and Lizaso for reimbursement.
*   Summons for Guansing was served on his brother, Reynaldo. Sheriff's return lacked details justifying substituted service.
*   Guansing filed a Motion to Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, denied by the RTC.
*   Guansing subsequently filed an Answer (general denial, reasserting lack of jurisdiction) and other pleadings including a pre-trial brief and motions for reconsideration and appeal.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of PGIC. The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed, holding that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction due to improper service of summons.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted PGIC's petition, reversed the CA decision, and affirmed the RTC ruling, ordering Guansing to pay PGIC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Service of Summons (Rules of Court, Rule 14, Secs. 6 & 7):** Personal service is the preferred mode; substituted service requires a detailed return showing diligent but unsuccessful attempts at personal service.
*   **Voluntary Appearance (Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sec. 20):** A defendant's voluntary appearance is equivalent to service of summons.
*   **Obligation to Reimburse:** Guansing has an obligation to reimburse PGIC for the damages caused by his employee and for which the insurance company indemnified their insured.

**Liabilities:**

*   Guansing is liable for the remaining cost of the Isuzu Crosswind, interest (12% per annum from August 28, 2006, to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until fully paid), attorney's fees, and costs of the suit.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Defective Service of Summons:** The SC agreed that the initial service of summons on Guansing was defective due to the lack of detail in the Sheriff's Return justifying substituted service. Cites *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals* regarding requirements for proper substituted service and detailed Sheriff's Return.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:** Despite the defective service, Guansing voluntarily submitted to the RTC's jurisdiction by filing an Answer and other pleadings seeking affirmative relief (e.g., Urgent Ex-Parte Motion for Postponement, Notice of Appeal).  Cites *Navale et al. v. Court of Appeals et al.* and *G.V. Florida Transport, Inc. v. Tiara Commercial Corporation*.
*   **Distinguishes *Garcia v. Sandiganbayan*:**  The SC distinguished the CA's reliance on *Garcia v. Sandiganbayan*, noting that *Garcia* involved a motion to dismiss, while Guansing filed pleadings beyond such motion that sought affirmative relief.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on *Garcia v. Sandiganbayan*:** The SC criticizes the CA's reliance on *Garcia*, highlighting that *Garcia* erroneously expanded the meaning of "voluntary appearance" as defined in the Rules of Court.
*   **Technical vs. Substantial Justice:** The SC emphasized that technicalities should not undermine substantial justice, advocating for resolving cases on their merits, not procedural errors.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Sections 6, 7, and 20:** Service of Summons and Voluntary Appearance.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(m):** Presumption that official duty has been regularly performed (disputable presumption).
*   ***De Pedro v. Romasan Development Corporation*:** Rules on service of summons.
*   ***Interlink Movie Houses Inc. et al. v. Court of Appeals et al.*:**  Jurisdiction over the defendant.
*   ***Manotoc v. Court of Appeals*:**  Requirements for substituted service and Sheriff's Return.
*   ***Navale et al. v. Court of Appeals et al.*:** Defects of summons are cured by voluntary appearance.
*   ***G.V. Florida Transport, Inc. v. Tiara Commercial Corporation*:** Definition of voluntary appearance
*   ***Rapid City Realty Development Corporation v. Villa*:** rules on voluntary appearance
*   ***Garcia v. Sandiganbayan*:** (Distinguished) Voluntary appearance in relation to a motion to dismiss.
*   ***Oaminal v. Castillo*:** The filing of Motions seeking affirmative relief.
