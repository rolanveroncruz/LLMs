## Legal Document Summary: *Briones v. People* (G.R. No. 156009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision finding Briones guilty of robbery.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Briones was charged with robbery under Article 293, in relation to Article 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), for taking a firearm from a security guard (Molina) through force, violence, and intimidation.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC convicted Briones of *theft*, not robbery, finding insufficient evidence of violence or intimidation. The RTC gave weight to the testimony of SG Gual who stated that Briones merely grabbed the firearm.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA reversed in part, finding Briones guilty of *robbery*, concluding that force and intimidation were present.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) *partly* granted the petition. The SC upheld Briones' conviction but *modified* the crime to *theft* under Article 308 of the RPC. The SC agreed with the RTC on the lack of violence and intimidation.

**Obligations:**

*   Briones is obligated to serve the sentence imposed for theft.

**Liabilities:**

*   Briones is criminally liable for theft.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The conflicting factual findings between the RTC and CA regarding the presence of violence and intimidation led to the SC re-evaluation. This highlights the importance of establishing the exact manner of taking in theft vs. robbery cases.
*   **Change of Defense:** Briones' attempt to introduce a new defense (self-defense or defense of a relative) on appeal was rejected by the SC. This underscores the importance of consistently maintaining a legal theory throughout the proceedings. *People v. Mercado* (G.R. No. 143676) was cited, holding that a client is generally bound by their counsel's actions.
*   **Newly Discovered Evidence:** Briones' motion for a new trial based on the discovery of the firearm and affidavits was denied. The SC highlighted that the evidence was not truly "newly discovered" as Briones knew of the firearm's location. Further, even with the new affidavits, the SC determined it was unable to negate commission of the crime charge. The conditions for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence were not met *Lorenzo Jose v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. L-38581).
*   **Variance Between Information and Proof:** While Briones was charged with robbery, he was convicted of theft. The SC upheld the conviction, stating that the crime is determined by the *facts* alleged in the Information, not the label.
*   **Valuation of Stolen Property:** The lack of concrete evidence regarding the firearm's value resulted in the SC imposing the minimum penalty for theft. In the absence of proof of value, doubt is resolved in favor of the accused.
