## Legal Document Summary: People v. Garchitorena, et al. (G.R. No. 175605)

**Nature of the Document:**  Decision of the Supreme Court affirming the conviction of Arnold Garchitorena, Joey Pamplona, and Jessie Garcia for Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659. The original RTC decision and the Court of Appeals decision affirming it are also referenced.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Accused-appellants found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder based on eyewitness testimony of Dulce Borero.
*   **Qualifying Circumstance:** Abuse of superior strength present, elevating the crime to murder.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found conspiracy existed between the accused-appellants, establishing joint liability.
*   **Defenses Rejected:** Alibi (Garcia) and Insanity (Garchitorena) were rejected by the lower courts and affirmed by the SC. Dr. Belen testified that accused Garchitorena was experiencing remission and was even aware of his murder case in court.
*   **Penalty:** Original Death penalty was reduced to Reclusion Perpetua, with the ineligibility of parole due to R.A. 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law).
*   **Damages:** Awards granted to the heirs of the victim Mauro Biay, including civil indemnity, moral damages, exemplary damages, actual damages, and loss of earning capacity.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellants are jointly and severally obligated to pay the victim's heirs.
*   Accused-appellants are obligated to serve Reclusion Perpetua without the chance of parole.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal Liability: Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Civil Liability: Payment of damages as ordered by the court.
*  Civil indemnity: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity
*   Moral Damages: P75,000.00 as moral damages
*   Exemplary Damages: P30,000.00 as exemplary damages
*   Temperate Damages: P25,000.00 as temperate damages in lieu of actual damages;
*   Loss of Earning Capacity: P408,000.00 for loss of earning capacity
*   Interest: 6% interest on all damages awarded from the date of the decision until fully paid

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Factual Issues:** The accused raised factual issues concerning the credibility of witnesses which were disregarded by the court due to the absence of cogent arguments showing that the trial court erred in appreciating the evidence.
*   **Defense of Insanity:** The court ruled that Garchitorena was not totally deprived of reason and freedom of will during and after the stabbing incident, as he even instructed his co-accused-appellants to run away from the scene of the crime
*   **Appeal Potential:** The denial of the above-mentioned errors by the accused-appellants show that an appeal is unlikely.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (Art. 248):** Defines Murder and its penalties.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Art. 63):** Rules for applying penalties when aggravating circumstances are present.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amended Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346 (Anti-Death Penalty Law):** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, leading to the reduction to Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **People v. Sadiangabay (G.R. No. 87214):** Ruling that a judge can render a valid decision even without hearing all the testimonies.
*   **People v. Cardel, 336 SCRA 144:** Trial Court has the best opportunity to observe witnesses on the stand to determine if they are telling the truth or not.
*   **People vs. Pendatun, 434 SCRA 148 & People vs. Sicad, et al., 391 SCRA 19:** Conspiracy can be deduced from the manner in which the offense was perpetrated or inferred from the acts of the accused.
*   **People of the Phils. vs. Parreno, 433 SCRA 591:** While it is true that superiority in number does not per se mean superiority in strength, the appellants in this case did not only enjoy superiority in number, but were armed with a weapon, while the victim had no means with which to defend himself.
*   **People of the Philippines vs. Aspuria, 391 SCRA 404:** The Court accepts that there is no standard behavior when one is confronted with a shocking incident.
*   **People of the Phils. vs. Cadampog, 428 SCRA 336:** Alibi is an inherently weak defense which cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by the victim.
*   **People of the Philippines vs. Galigao, 395 SCRA 195:** The Court held that the defense of insanity cannot be given merit when the expert witness herself, Dr. Belen, attested that accused Arnold Garchitorena was experiencing remission and was even aware of his murder case in court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Dulce Borero:** Initially, accused-appellant Pamplona capitalized on Dulce Borero's inaction at the time when she had supposedly witnessed the slaying of her younger brother. He argued that if she really witnessed the crime, she would have had readily helped her brother Mauro instead of fleeing. In the end, the Court did not find reason to overturn the ruling of the trial court and upheld the trial court's giving credence to prosecution witness Dulce Borero.
*   **Defenses of Alibi and Insanity:** The lower courts rejected these and the Supreme Court affirmed the rejections, finding the evidence insufficient to support them.
*   **Loss of earning capacity:** The Court allowed for the award of damages for loss of earning capacity despite the absence of documentary evidence when (1) the deceased is self-employed and earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws, in which case judicial notice may be taken of the fact that in the deceased's line of work no documentary evidence is available; or (2) the deceased is employed as a daily wage worker earning less than the minimum wage under current labor laws.
