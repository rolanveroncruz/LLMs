**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-11-2959 & P-14-3230**

**Case:** Office of the Court Administrator v. Alma P. Licay, Clerk of Court II, MCTC, San Juan-San Gabriel, La Union

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases against a Clerk of Court for (1) shortages in judiciary collections and undocumented withdrawal of cash bonds (A.M. No. P-11-2959) and (2) continuous failure to submit Monthly Financial Reports (A.M. No. P-14-3230).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **A.M. No. P-14-3230 (Non-Submission of Reports):**  Licay repeatedly failed to submit JDF, SAJ, FF, STF, and General Fund Monthly Financial Reports despite multiple directives from the OCA and the Court, violating Administrative Circulars No. 3-2000, 35-2004, 50-95, and 113-2004.
*   **Finding:** The Court found Licay guilty of Grave Misconduct (defiance of Court directives) and Gross Neglect of Duty (non-submission of reports). This is supported by *Office of the Court Administrator v. Ganzan* (616 Phil. 15, 23 (2009)), *Alday v. Cruz, Jr.* (426 Phil. 385, 390 (2002)), *Office of the Court Administrator v. Reyes* (635 Phil. 490, 496, 502 (2010)), *Grefaldeo v. Lacson* (355 Phil. 266, 272-273 (1998)), and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Viesca* (758 Phil. 16, 26 (2015)). Court also cited Administrative Circular 3-2000, 35-2004, and OCA Circular 50-95, and 113-2004. *Bascos v. Ramirez* (700 Phil. 120, 128 (2012)).
*   **A.M. No. P-11-2959 (Shortages & Undocumented Withdrawals):** Audit revealed shortages in judiciary collections. Licay was previously suspended for six months without pay and fined P5,000 for delayed remittances. Restitution of shortages ordered.  The main remaining issue is the failure to fully document withdrawals of cash bonds totaling P872,175.00.
*   **Partial Compliance:** Licay partially complied by restituting certain shortages and submitting some documentation for the cash bond withdrawals.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Licay claimed illness (stroke, diabetes, asthma) and lost files due to court transfers as reasons for non-compliance. She proposed deducting the amount of P413,500 from her withheld salary to cover the missing fiduciary fund documents.
*   **Court's Rejection of Defense:** The Court dismissed the health defense, stating it did not excuse prior omissions (citing *Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Lopez*, 723 Phil. 256, 268 (2013)).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Restitution:** Licay is obligated to restitute the remaining undocumented withdrawn cash bonds (amount to be precisely determined) in A.M. No. P-11-2959.
*   **Legal Office Action:**  The OCA's Legal Office is directed to file civil and criminal cases if restitution fails.
*   **Dismissal:** Licay is dismissed from service in A.M. No. P-14-3230, forfeiting all employment benefits except accrued leave. Re-employment in government is barred.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Quantification of Restitution Amount:**  The exact amount of undocumented withdrawn cash bonds remains to be definitively calculated by the Fiscal Monitoring Division, introducing a potential point of contention. The failure to clearly define what will be sufficient documentation may also be problematic.
*   **Civil and Criminal Liability:** The OCA Legal Office is mandated to pursue civil and criminal charges if restitution fails, creating significant legal exposure for Licay. The nature of these charges needs to be clarified. Potential charges include but are not limited to malversation, estafa, or other crimes related to mishandling public funds.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances (Illness):** The Court acknowledges the respondent's health but finds it does not excuse her prior administrative lapses. This may be a potential ground for appeal based on a violation of her right to due process and equal protection under the law.
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Deductions:** While Licay proposed deductions, there is no order to do so.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Administrative Circular No. 3-2000
*   Administrative Circular No. 35-2004
*   OCA Circular No. 50-95

**Conclusion:**

This decision is unfavorable to Licay. She faces dismissal, potential criminal prosecution, and a significant financial obligation. An appeal focusing on the quantification of the amount, due process regarding her health, and potential disproportionate penalties should be considered.
