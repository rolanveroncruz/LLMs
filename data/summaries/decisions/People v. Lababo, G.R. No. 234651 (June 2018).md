## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Lababo*, G.R. No. 234651 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for Murder and Frustrated Murder.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Murder (Art. 248, RPC):** Affirmed conviction for Benito Lababo, Wenefredo Lababo, and FFF. Established through circumstantial evidence (no eyewitness).  The court relied on the circumstances enumerated within the decision to sustain the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. Found that the attack on AAA exhibited treachery.
*   **Frustrated Murder:** Affirmed conviction for Benito Lababo and Wenefredo Lababo.  BBB sustained multiple gunshot wounds (eight) that would have been fatal absent medical intervention. *Cirera v. People* cited re: frustrated murder elements.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence due to lack of eyewitnesses.  The Court emphasizes that such evidence is sufficient for conviction if it meets the criteria outlined in *People v. Evangelio*.
*   **Conspiracy (Art. 8, RPC):** Affirmed finding of conspiracy amongst all accused. Wenefredo and FFF, despite only holding bolos, provided moral support and prevented intervention. *Bahilidad v. People* cited for conspiracy principles. Presence, while armed, at the scene was sufficient to demonstrate a common criminal design. The Court states "one who participates in the material execution of the crime by standing guard or lending moral support to the actual perpetration thereof is criminally responsible to the same extent as the actual perpetrator, especially if they did nothing to prevent the commission of the crime."
*   **Minority of FFF:** CA correctly modified FFF's sentence due to his age (17) at the time of the crime, applying Art. 68(2) of the RPC and RA No. 9346. Reduced penalty from *reclusion perpetua* to *prision mayor* as minimum to *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
*   **Suspended Sentence for FFF:** Under Sec. 38 of RA 9344 (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006), FFF is entitled to automatic suspension of sentence, regardless of the imposable penalty. Case remanded to the court of origin for appropriate disposition (confinement in an agricultural camp/training facility per Sec. 51 of RA 9344). *People v. Sarcia* cited. This applies even if the child is over the age of 18 at the time of the promulgation of the judgment of conviction.
*   **Damages:** Damages modified to conform with *People v. Jugueta*: Civil Indemnity, Moral Damages, and Exemplary Damages are increased.

**Obligations:**

*   Benito and Wenefredo Lababo: Serve sentences for Murder and Frustrated Murder.
*   FFF: Case remanded for disposition under RA 9344. Subject to rehabilitation and reintegration program.
*   All Accused (Benito, Wenefredo, and FFF): Jointly and severally liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the victims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Murder and Frustrated Murder.
*   Civil liability for damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Reliance on circumstantial evidence always carries some risk of factual error. Although the appellate courts affirmed the trial court, the lack of a direct eyewitness is a potential weakness.
*   **Conspiracy Finding:** The finding of conspiracy based solely on presence while armed could be contested, as the evidence of specific agreement to commit the crime relies on inference. Defense could argue lack of *mens rea* for participation in the murder.
*   **Discretion in Remand:** The court of origin has discretion in determining the appropriate disposition for FFF under RA 9344. The severity of the crime may influence the selection of disposition measures.
