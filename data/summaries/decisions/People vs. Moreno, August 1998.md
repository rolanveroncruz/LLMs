## Legal Document Summary: People v. Moreno

**Case:** G.R. No. 126921, August 28, 1998 (356 Phil. 231)

**Nature:** Appeal of a rape conviction.

**Facts:** The accused, Jose Moreno, was convicted of rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code for having carnal knowledge of Jocelyn Bansagales, a mental retardate (mental age of six), by means of force and intimidation.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Art. 335, Revised Penal Code (Rape):** The case revolves around the interpretation of the different circumstances under which rape is committed, particularly:
    *   (1) By using force or intimidation;
    *   (2) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and
    *   (3) When the woman is under twelve years of age.

*   **Information:** The Information charged the accused with rape *by means of force and intimidation* (paragraph 1 of Art. 335).
*   **Victim's Competency:** The victim was a 26-year-old woman with a mental age of six. The court had to address whether she was a competent witness, given her mental capacity.
*   **Mens Rea:** The defense argued a lack of *mens rea* (criminal intent), claiming the accused was unaware of the victim's mental deficiency.

**Ruling and Rationale:**

*   **Affirmed conviction under Art. 335(1):** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for rape under Art. 335(1), finding sufficient evidence of *force and intimidation*, given the victim's reduced mental capacity.
*   **Force and Intimidation Standard:** The Court clarified that the force necessary for rape is relative to the victim's age, size, and strength. Less force is required to overcome a mentally retarded individual.
*   **Victim as Witness:** The Court determined that the victim was competent to testify, as she could perceive events and communicate her perceptions. Her low IQ did not automatically disqualify her.
    *   Cited *People v. Salomon*, *People v. Gerones*, and *People v. Antonio*.
*   **Mens Rea:** The Court rejected the lack of *mens rea* argument, finding that the accused, as a long-time neighbor, was likely aware of the victim's obvious mental deficiency.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** The Court modified the judgment to include civil indemnity and moral damages of P50,000 each (totaling P100,000) for the victim.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conviction on a Ground Not Alleged in the Information (Dissenting Opinion):** Justice Davide Jr.'s dissenting opinion argues that the accused could be validly convicted of rape under either the second or third circumstance of Article 335, even if the information charged him only with rape under the first circumstance due to the waiver of the constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation due to the appelants failure to object the evidence.
    *   This raises a potential due process issue (right to be informed of the charges).
    *   The majority, however, found conviction under 335(1) proper, avoiding this issue.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Pailano:** Cited by the appellant to argue against conviction on grounds not alleged in the Information. Distinguishes this case by affirming conviction for original charge, rape by force and intimidation.
*   **US v. Karelsen:** Addresses purpose of written accusation.
*   **People v. Mabag y Labado:** Court sustained the conviction of the accused under Article 335 although he was charged with having violated Article 293 in relation to Paragraph 2 of Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **People v. Salomon, People v. Gerones, People v. Antonio:** Regarding the competency of mental retardates as witnesses.
*   **People v. Rosare:** Regarding the issue of imbecility, mental retardation, and statutory rape and conviction under paragraph 2 of article 335.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 335, Revised Penal Code:** Definition of rape and its different modes of commission.
*   **Sec. 18, Rule 130, Rules of Court:** Qualifications of a witness.
*   **Art. 29, Revised Penal Code:** Preventive imprisonment

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The relationship between the victim and perpetrator can be considered ambiguous or contentious since, if they had a relationship where the victim had a mental age below that of a woman less than 12 years of age, the pronouncement to bring carnal knowledge of her within the first circumstance of Article 335 was that forwarded in People v. Gallano (supra, at 413), to wit:

Her mental condition was such that she would not resist sexual advances because she was so deprived of reason to make any effective resistance. Hence, by her being so deprived, the act is made possible in the same way when there is active resistance but [the] same is overcome by force or threat, which is the essence of the crime of rape.
