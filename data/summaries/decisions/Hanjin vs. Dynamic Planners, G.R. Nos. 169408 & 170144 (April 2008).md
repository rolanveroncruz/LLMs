Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Co., Ltd. v. Dynamic Planners and Construction Corp.*, G.R. Nos. 169408 & 170144, April 30, 2008.

**Nature of Dispute:** Construction dispute arising from a Subcontract Agreement between Hanjin (contractor) and Dynamic (subcontractor) for a portion of the Davao International Airport Project. Hanjin alleges Dynamic abandoned the project, while Dynamic claims Hanjin withheld payments. The CIAC rendered a decision awarding most of Dynamic's claims, which was appealed to the CA. The CA issued two decisions with modifications.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Subcontract Agreement:**  Unit price agreement, incorporating by reference the Main Contract between DOTC and Hanjin. Includes provisions on down payment (Art. 6.1), progress billing (Art. 6.2), retention money (Art. 7), and defects liability (Art. 8.3).
*   **Hanjin's Obligations:**  To provide down payment within 20 days of contract signing (breached), pay progress billings within 7 days of DOTC payment, and ensure Dynamic receives 35% of the contract price in USD as per the main contract (back-to-back arrangement).
*   **Dynamic's Obligations:** Completion of the subcontracted works, and repair and make good all defects in the Subcontract Works at his own cost (Art. 8.3).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Hanjin's Liability:** Liable for failure to comply with the back-to-back arrangement, including payment in foreign currency and price adjustments. Also liable for bad faith in handling payments and attempting to pass on retrofitting costs.
*   **Dynamic's Liability:** Initially responsible for completing subcontract works but found not liable for abandonment or associated costs due to Hanjin's actions.

**Key Awards & Amounts:**

*   **Original Subcontract Price**: PhP 714,868,129.00
*   **Retention Money**: PhP 58,210,336.00 (owed to Dynamic)
*   **Foreign Currency Adjustment**:  PhP 131,338,674.80 (owed to Dynamic)
*   **Price Escalation**:  PhP 53,744,697.39 (owed to Dynamic)
*   **Net Award**:  PhP 293,952,273.36 (owed to Dynamic)
*   **Attorney's Fees**:  PhP 500,000.00 (owed to Dynamic)
*   **Interest**: Imposed on awarded amounts, starting at 6% from November 20, 2003 (date of extrajudicial demand) until the award becomes final and executory, then 12% per annum from finality until satisfaction.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Back-to-Back" Interpretation:**  Hanjin contested the full extent of the "back-to-back" arrangement, specifically regarding foreign currency payments and price escalation.  The court upheld the CA and CIAC's broader interpretation benefiting Dynamic.
*   **Abandonment Claim:** Hanjin's claim of abandonment was rejected by both CIAC and CA. This rejection significantly impacted cost recovery and retention money.
*   **Computation of Awards:** Complex calculations related to price escalation, variation orders, and "Net Cost to Complete" were heavily contested. Accuracy of documentation became crucial.
*   **Supplementary Agreement**: Modification of the original agreement and its effect on the responsibility of procuring material
*   **Design Deficiency Liability**: Responsibility for the retrofitting of the cracked beams which was passed on to Dynamic from Hanjin

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1169 (Civil Code):**  Regarding reciprocal obligations and delay.  Cited in relation to Hanjin's failure to pay progress billings.
*   **Article 1186 (Civil Code):** Condition deemed fulfilled when obligor prevents its fulfillment; relevant to Hanjin preventing Dynamic from completing the project.
*   **Article 1235 (Civil Code):** Obligation deemed complied with when obligee accepts the performance thereof knowing its incompleteness or irregularity, and without expressing any protest or objection.
*   **Article 1374 (Civil Code):** Stipulations in a contract and other contract documents should be interpreted together with the end in view of giving effect to all.
*   **Article 2208 (Civil Code):** Conditions for awarding attorney's fees.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines v. CA***: Establishes rules for interest calculations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The lack of clarity in the subcontract agreement regarding the precise application of the "back-to-back" arrangement led to significant disputes.
*   The absence of a "Taking Over Certificate" created a barrier to the release of retention money.

**Overall:**

The Supreme Court largely affirmed the CA's findings, holding Hanjin liable for breach of contract, bad faith, and attempts to improperly shift costs. Key to the decision was the interpretation of the "back-to-back" clause, the finding of no abandonment by Dynamic, and the detailed analysis of the contested calculations. The Court modified the CA ruling solely with respect to the interest calculation, aligning it with prevailing jurisprudence.
