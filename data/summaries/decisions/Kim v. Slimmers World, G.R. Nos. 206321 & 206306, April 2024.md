## Legal Document Summary: Miguel Kim vs. Slimmers World International, et al.

**Case:** Consolidated petitions (G.R. No. 206306 and G.R. No. 206321) concerning the liability of Slimmers World International (SWI) for the death of a client, Adelaida Kim, following a workout.

**Key Issue:** Whether SWI, its managing director (Quinto), and trainer (Cuesta) are liable for damages resulting from Adelaida Kim's death based on either contractual negligence (culpa contractual) or quasi-delict (culpa aquiliana).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision and dismissed Miguel Kim's complaint for damages, finding *no merit* to either negligence claim.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Contractual Negligence (Art. 1172, Civil Code):**
    *   The Court found no *breach of contract* by SWI because the Member's Handout, constituting the contract, did *not* explicitly obligate SWI to take Adelaida's blood pressure before every workout or have a doctor on site at all times.
    *   The CA erred in relying on a newspaper advertisement, which the Court deemed a *mere invitation to offer*, not a binding term of the contract. *Swedish Match, AB v. Court of Appeals, 483 Phil. 735 (2004)*
    *   There was evidence showing medical supervision in the form of Registered Nurses and Physical Therapists.
    *   Plaintiff failed to properly authenticate submitted documents.

*   **Quasi-Delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code):**
    *   While damage (Adelaida's death) was established, Miguel Kim *failed* to prove *negligence* by SWI and *proximate causation* between any alleged negligence and Adelaida's death.
    *   The court notes inconsistencies in testimony and the fact that Adelaida stated she was ok before the workout.
    *   Adelaida Kim had expressly declared on her application that she was *not* hypertensive or suffering from other relevant medical conditions. Estoppel bars changing said declaration to hold the fitness center accountable. *Rule 131 Section 2(a), 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence*
    *   Expert testimony (Dr. Quilala) indicated SWI's personnel acted according to standards of care in emergency situations.
    *   The Court states that proximate cause requires a direct and foreseeable link between negligence and the harm. The SC stated the gym staff acted promptly. *VDM Trading, Inc. v. Carungcong, 846 Phil. 425 (2019)* *Dr. Dela Llana v. Biong, 722 Phil. 743 (2013)*

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The document clarifies that fitness centers are *not* mandated to guarantee safety from all risks, but they have a duty not to engage in reckless or gross negligence. They are bound by the "standard of care congruent with the nature of their business"
*   Parties are bound by the terms of the signed contracts.
*   The court states that expert testimonies are needed to help determine proximate cause between the actions of the defendant and the plaintiff's ailments.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   Reliance on self-reported health information: Fitness centers are not necessarily responsible for verifying client health, but may face liability if ignoring obvious signs of distress.
*   Lack of standardized emergency protocols: The case implies that having trained personnel and a reasonable response plan (summoning medical assistance) can mitigate liability.
*   Evidentiary Burden: Establishing negligence and proximate cause remains a significant challenge, particularly in quasi-delict cases.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Orient Freight International, Inc. v. Keihin-Everett Forwarding Co., Inc., 816 Phil. 163 (2017)* (Differences between culpa aquiliana and contractual negligence)
*   *Dr. Huang v. Philippine Hoteliers, Inc., 700 Phil. 327 (2012)* (Distinctions between quasi-delict and breach of contract)
*   *VDM Trading, Inc. v. Carungcong, 846 Phil. 425 (2019)* (Proximate cause in negligence claims)

**Statutory References:**

*   Art. 1172, Civil Code (Contractual Negligence)
*   Art. 2176, Civil Code (Quasi-Delict)
*   Rule 132, Section 20, 2019 Amendments to the 1989 Revised Rules on Evidence (Authentication of Private Documents)
*   Rule 131 Section 2(a), 2019 Revised Rules on Evidence (Estoppel)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The issue of "medical supervision" as advertised by SWI was contentious, but the Court ruled that it was clarified in the contract.
