## Legal Document Summary: *NPC v. Heirs of Casionan*, G.R. No. 165969

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Summary:** This case concerns the liability of the National Power Corporation (NPC) for the death of Noble Casionan, who was electrocuted by sagging high-tension wires owned and maintained by the NPC. The NPC argues for mitigation of damages based on contributory negligence.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Negligence of NPC:** The RTC and CA found NPC negligent due to its failure to maintain its high-tension wires at a safe height (18-20 feet), as evidenced by repeated prior warnings from the community. The wires were hanging at only 8-10 feet.
*   **Lack of Contributory Negligence:** Both lower courts, and upheld by the Supreme Court, found no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. He was using a regularly used trail with no adequate warning signs.  Simply carrying bamboo poles, absent warnings or obvious danger, did not constitute negligence.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The Court held that NPC's negligence in maintaining the wires was the proximate cause of the electrocution.  The victim's pocket mining activity (even if unlicensed) was not directly causative of the electrocution, and the lack of a permit does not justify the NPC’s negligence.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Indemnity for death:** P50,000.00
    *   **Moral damages:** Reduced by CA to P50,000.00
    *   **Exemplary damages:** P50,000.00 (justified by gross negligence)
    *   **Actual damages:** P52,277.50 (burial expenses)
    *   **Loss of unearned income:** P720,000.00 (calculated using the formula outlined in the decision)
    *   **Attorney's fees:** Disallowed by CA due to lack of explanation in the RTC decision body.

**Obligations:**

*   **NPC's Duty of Care:** The NPC has a duty to maintain its high-tension wires to ensure public safety, including maintaining proper height and providing adequate warnings.
*   **Compliance with Standards:** The NPC must adhere to industry standards for the height of power lines above ground.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Liability for Quasi-Delict (Art. 2176, Civil Code):** The NPC is liable for damages arising from its negligence (quasi-delict) that caused the death of Noble Casionan.
*   **Vicarious Liability:** No explicit discussion, but the NPC is responsible for the actions and omissions of its employees related to maintenance and safety.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** NPC challenged the facts, particularly the lack of contributory negligence. The SC emphasized that factual findings of the lower courts are generally binding on appeal.
*   **Calculation of Damages:** The calculation of unearned income relies on assumptions about the deceased's future earnings and life expectancy. Though standard in tort claims, this can be contested based on individual circumstances.
*   **"Gross Negligence" Finding:** This finding exposes the NPC to exemplary damages, which are meant to deter future egregious conduct. The standard for "gross negligence" is the absence of even slight care.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code (Philippines):**
    *   Art. 2176 (Quasi-Delict)
    *   Art. 2179 (Contributory Negligence)
    *   Art. 2231 (Exemplary Damages)
*   **Relevant Cases:**
    *   *Ma-ao Sugar Central Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 83491 (1990): Discusses the duty to maintain equipment and the lack of contributory negligence in the absence of warnings.
    *   *Añonuevo v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 130003 (2004): Violation of a statute is not sufficient to establish causation unless the violation was the proximate cause of the injury.
    *   *Lambert v. Heirs of Ray Castillon*, G.R. No. 160709 (2005) and *Pleyto v. Lomboy, G.R. No. 148737 (2004): Provided formula for calculating loss of earning capacity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   There are no obviously ambiguous clauses within the decision. However, the factual assessment of negligence and contributory negligence are areas where reasonable minds could differ, as evidenced by the NPC's continued arguments.

**Overall Assessment:**

The NPC faces significant liability due to its failure to maintain its power lines properly and respond to repeated warnings. The finding of gross negligence and the assessment of damages create a substantial financial exposure. The case highlights the importance of proactive maintenance and adherence to safety standards in industries dealing with hazardous infrastructure.
