Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 221199):

**Case Summary: *Geminiano S. Murillo v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc. et al.***

**Subject:**  Dispute over disability benefits for a seafarer, specifically addressing the mandatory nature of the "third doctor" provision in the POEA-SEC (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC, Section 20(B)(3):**  Governs compensation for injury or illness. Mandates a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within 3 days of repatriation. Crucially, it provides that if the seafarer's physician disagrees with the company physician's assessment, a third doctor, jointly agreed upon, makes a final and binding decision.
*   **Seafarer's Obligation:**  To submit to the company physician for examination; If disagreeing with the company doctor's assessment, the seafarer must initiate the process of selecting a third doctor.
*   **Employer's Obligation:**  To provide medical attention until the seafarer is declared fit or the degree of disability is established by the company-designated physician. Should disagreement arise in medical findings, employer must participate in the process of selecting a third doctor.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:**  The Court found Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., Norwegian Crew Management A/S, and Carlos C. Salinas jointly and severally liable for the seafarer's disability benefits, albeit at a reduced amount (US$20,150.00) compared to the initial Labor Arbiter decision (US$90,000.00).
*   **Seafarer's Liability:** Ordered to return any excess amounts received.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Failure to Follow Third Doctor Procedure:** The *Murillo* case reinforces the mandatory nature of the "third doctor" rule as established in *Formerly INC Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Rosales* (744 Phil. 774 (2014)) and *Silagan vs. Southfield Agencies, Inc.* (793 Phil. 751, 764 (2016)). Failure to initiate this process constitutes a breach of the POEA-SEC and renders the company-designated physician's assessment final and binding (see *Philippine Hammonia Ship Agency, Inc. vs. Dumagdag*, 712 Phil. 507 (2013)).
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:**  The case highlights the potential for disagreement between the company-designated physician and the seafarer's chosen physician.
*   **Disability Assessment Discrepancy:**  The CA erred in dismissing the complaint entirely when it gave credence to the medical assessment of the company-designated physician over that of the petitioner's personal physician. The Court awarded the petitioner with compensation equivalent to the injury which the latter sustained and which was assessed by the company-designated physician.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (2000 Amended Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers on Board Ocean-Going Vessels), Section 20(B)(3).**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45**
*   ***Andrada vs. Agemar Manning Agency, Inc.*, 698 Phil. 170, 181 (2012)**
*   ***Philippine Hammonia Ship Agency, Inc. vs. Dumagdag*, 712 Phil. 507 (2013)**
*   ***Formerly INC Shipmanagement, Inc. vs. Rosales*, 744 Phil. 774 (2014)**
*   ***Silagan vs. Southfield Agencies, Inc.*, 793 Phil. 751, 764 (2016)**
*   **Section 32 of the POEA-SEC**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**  None specifically identified, but the consistent litigation surrounding the "third doctor" provision indicates ongoing dispute on the interpretation and application of that clause.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court **PARTLY GRANTED** the petition.  The CA decision was modified. The seafarer was awarded US$20,150.00 (or its peso equivalent) based on the disability grading assigned by the company-designated physician, despite his failure to initiate the "third doctor" procedure.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   This case clarifies that while a seafarer can seek a second medical opinion, failing to adhere to the mandated third-doctor conflict resolution procedure in Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC is a breach of contract.
*   The case balances the seafarer's right to seek a second opinion with the need for an orderly and binding resolution mechanism for disability claims.
