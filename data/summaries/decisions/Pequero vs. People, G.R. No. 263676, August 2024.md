**Case:** *Pedro Pequero y Nollora vs. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 263676, August 7, 2024

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) partially granted Pedro Pequero y Nollora's petition, affirming his conviction for (1) use of illegal alias under Commonwealth Act No. 142, as amended by Republic Act No. 6085, and (2) use of fictitious name under Article 178 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 10951. However, the Court acquitted him of usurpation of authority or official functions under Article 177 of the RPC.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Use of Illegal Alias (CA 142):** The SC affirmed the lower courts' finding that Pedro used "Atty. Epafrodito Nollora" without legal authorization, violating CA 142.
*   **Use of Fictitious Name (Art. 178, RPC):** The SC found that Pedro publicly used a fictitious name by assuming the identity of a deceased lawyer, causing damage. The penalty was adjusted retroactively based on RA 10951, which is more favorable to the accused.
*   **Usurpation of Authority/Official Functions (Art. 177, RPC):** The SC reversed the conviction. While Pedro represented himself as a lawyer, the Court clarified that lawyers are not considered "persons in authority" within the meaning of Article 177, read in conjunction with Article 152 of the RPC, except for purposes of Articles 148 (Direct Assault) and 151 (Resistance and Disobedience). *Tiongco v. People, 843 Phil. 225, 243 (2018)* was cited regarding the elements of the crime.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Pedro is obligated to serve the sentence for use of illegal alias and use of fictitious name. The sentence for the latter will have to be adjusted as mentioned above.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Factual Determination:** The SC emphasized its limited jurisdiction under Rule 45 to review only errors of law, not to re-evaluate facts already established by the lower courts.
*   **Retroactivity of RA 10951:** The Court applied RA 10951 retroactively because its provision is more favorable to the accused. Section 100 of RA 10951 provides for its retroactive effect.
*   **Definition of "Person in Authority":** The crucial point leading to acquittal on usurpation hinges on the interpretation of "person in authority" under Article 152 of the RPC, specifically as it relates to Article 177. The Court strictly construed the definition against the accused. *Judge Ramos v. Atty. Lazo, 883 Phil. 318, 324 (2020)* was cited in relation to Lawyers.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of Article 152 of the RPC in defining "person in authority" for purposes of Article 177 was a key contentious point. The Court's interpretation is crucial for similar cases involving usurpation charges against individuals falsely representing professions.
