## Legal Document Summary: Morales vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126196

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which set aside the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision in an ejectment (forcible entry) case and remanded it to the Municipal Trial Court (MTC).

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Central Issue:** Whether the RTC, on appeal from an MTC decision dismissing the ejectment case for lack of jurisdiction but after receiving evidence on the merits, could rule on the merits, or whether it should have remanded the case to the MTC for further proceedings.
*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision and reinstated the RTC's decision. The SC held that the RTC acted correctly in resolving the ejectment suit on its merits.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **No Need for Remand:** Remand is only required when the MTC rules on a question of law without a trial on the merits. In this case, the MTC received evidence and made factual findings, although it erroneously concluded it lacked jurisdiction. Remanding would be a superfluous and wasteful exercise.
    *   **Efficiency:** Based on Rule 1, Section 2 (now 6) of the Rules of Court, liberal construction of the Rules to attain just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of any action or proceeding is allowed.
    *   **Finality of Judgment:** Respondent failed to appeal the RTC decision within the reglementary period, making it final and executory. Certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal.
    *   **Evidence Supported RTC:** The RTC's factual findings, based on evidence presented before the MTC, supported the claim of forcible entry. The private respondent's entry was considered to have been done through stealth and strategy.

**Obligations:**

*   Defendant/Respondent: Obligation to vacate the premises, deliver possession to the plaintiffs, and pay P50,000 as reasonable compensation and P50,000 as attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   Defendant/Respondent: Liable for illegal occupation and use of the property, including the value of crops unlawfully planted and harvested.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Issues:** The respondent may resist complying with the order to vacate and pay damages, potentially necessitating further legal action for enforcement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 40, Section 10 (Old Rules of Court):**  Governing appellate powers of the then Court of First Instance (now RTC) when the inferior court (now MTC) did not try the action on its merits.
*   **Rule 40, Section 8 (Amended Rules of Court, now in effect):** Same as above, the RTC, if it has jurisdiction, shall try the case on the merits as if the case was originally filed with it.
*   **Rule 1, Section 2 (now 6) Rules of Court:** mandate for liberal construction of the Rules to attain just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of any action or proceeding.
*   **R.A. 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), which the MTC erroneously believed vested jurisdiction in the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB). The SC clarified that the land was reclassified as residential and thus not under the purview of CARP.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The MTC initially dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction (erroneously based on agrarian dispute), but the RTC correctly ruled that the land was classified as residential land and not agricultural.
*   **Forcible Entry:** The MTC's conclusion that there was no forcible entry because the parties were related was contradicted by the RTC's finding, based on the same evidence, that stealth and strategy were used to gain possession.
*   **Procedural Lapse:** Failure of the Respondent to file an appeal on time from the RTC decision, which made the decision final and executory.
