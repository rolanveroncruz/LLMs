**Legal Document Summary: *Retazo v. Verdon* (A.M. No. P-04-1807) and *Office of the Court Administrator v. Verdon* (A.M. No. P-02-1653)**

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases against Lorna A. Verdon, Clerk of Court, MCTC, Don Carlos, Bukidnon, for shortages in cash collections and malversation of public funds.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Finding:** Verdon found GUILTY of DISHONESTY and GRAVE MISCONDUCT.
*   **Penalty:** DISMISSED from service with forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from government re-employment.  Criminal prosecution not precluded.
*   **Restitution:** Financial Management Office (OCA) directed to deduct P268,220.00 from withheld salaries:
    *   P238,220.00 to be deposited to the MCTC's fiduciary account to cover shortages identified in the COA audit.
    *   P30,000.00 to be returned to Teresita Retazo representing the cancelled bail bond in Criminal Case No. 10586-2000 upon proper documentation.
*   **Fine:** P1,000.00 to be deducted from withheld salaries, corresponding to a previous contempt fine.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Verdon's Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** As Clerk of Court, Verdon had a fiduciary duty to safeguard court funds.  Her failure to account for P238,220.00 and P30,000.00 constitutes a breach of this duty. Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court specifies record keeping requirements for the clerk.
*   **Restitutionary Obligation:**  Verdon has an obligation to make restitution for the misappropriated funds and to pay the contempt fine, now enforced through deductions from her withheld salaries.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The decision expressly states that the dismissal is *without prejudice* to criminal charges. A criminal complaint for malversation under the Revised Penal Code (Art. 217) is a potential risk. *Navallo v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 97214) is cited, reinforcing the principle that a shortage in accounts, unexplained by the accountable officer, can lead to a malversation conviction even without direct proof of misappropriation.
*   **Documentation for Bail Bond Return:**  The order to return P30,000 to Teresita Retazo is contingent on "showing of proper documentation."  This clause is ambiguous and creates a potential point of contention if there is disagreement about what constitutes "proper documentation."  Verification of the acquittal order and bail posting are critical.
* **Accrued leave Credits:** The phrase "except accrued leave credits, if any" is conditional, and the exact amount of leave credits needs to be determined and calculated.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **1987 Constitution, Art. XI, Sec. 1:** Cites the constitutional provision stating that public office is a public trust.
*   **Section 7, Rule 136 of the Rules of Court:**  Sets out the duties of the Clerk of Court.
*   **Section 23, Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of E.O No. 292:** Defines dishonesty and grave misconduct as grave offenses warranting dismissal.
*   **Section 9 of the said Rule:** Details additional penalties attached to dismissal such as ineligibility for government re-employment.
*   **Navallo v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 97214:**  Establishes that an unexplained shortage in accounts can be sufficient for a malversation conviction.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

* The clause "upon showing of proper documentation" when requesting a refund for the bail money can create a potential point of contention if there is disagreement about what constitutes "proper documentation".

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court has affirmed the OCA's findings of dishonesty and grave misconduct, imposing a severe penalty on Verdon. The primary concern is the potential for criminal prosecution and the need to diligently handle the restitution process, particularly regarding the documentation for the bail bond return. Due diligence is required to calculate accrued leave credits to mitigate the potential points of contention.
