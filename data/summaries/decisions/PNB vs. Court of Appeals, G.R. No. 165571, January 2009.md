## Legal Document Summary: PNB and Equitable PCI Bank v. CA, SEC, ASB Holdings, et al.

**Case:** G.R. No. 165571, January 20, 2009 (596 Phil. 586)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Philippine National Bank (PNB) and Equitable PCI Bank (creditor banks). PNB's interest was later sold to Golden Dragon Star Equities, Inc. and assigned to Opal Portfolio Investments, Inc. (Opal).
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals (CA), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and ASB Group (ASB Holdings, Inc., ASB Realty Corporation, ASB Development Corporation, ASB Land Inc., ASB Finance, Inc., Makati Hope Christian School, Inc., Bel-Air Holdings Corporation, Winchester Trading, Inc., VYL Development Corporation, Gerick Holdings Corporation, and Neighborhood Holdings, Inc.).

**Subject Matter:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's decision upholding the SEC's approval of the ASB Group's Rehabilitation Plan and appointment of a rehabilitation receiver under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 902-A.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Mortgage Trust Indenture (MTI):** Loan agreement between the consortium of creditor banks (including Petitioners) and ASB Development Corporation (ASBDC) for PhP 1,081,000,000, secured by a mortgage on ASBDC's properties.
*   **Rehabilitation Plan:** Proposed plan by ASB Group to address its financial difficulties and meet its obligations to creditors. Approved by the SEC Hearing Panel and affirmed by SEC En Banc and CA.
*   **Suspension Order:** Order issued by SEC suspending all actions for claims against the ASB Group, prohibiting the disposal of properties (except in the ordinary course of business) and payments of outstanding liabilities.
*   **Appointment of Receiver:** Appointment of Atty. Fortunato Cruz as Rehabilitation Receiver.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential Impairment of Contract (MTI):** Petitioners alleged that the Rehabilitation Plan (specifically the proposed *dacion en pago* and waiver of interests/penalties) impairs the MTI and infringes on the constitutional right against non-impairment of contracts. The Court held that the provisions of the loan agreements are merely suspended during rehabilitation, and secured creditors retain their preference upon liquidation. *See Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. ASB Holdings, Inc.* The creditors are not forced to accept the terms of the rehabilitation plan.
*   **Loss of Control over Collateral:** The Rehabilitation Plan potentially restricts the creditors' ability to foreclose on mortgaged properties.
*   **Possible Delay in Recovery:** The rehabilitation process could prolong the time it takes for the creditor banks to recover their investment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. (PD) 902-A (as amended):** Law governing corporate rehabilitation and receivership.
*   **Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery:** Implementing rules for PD 902-A. Specifically references Rules III (Suspension of Payments) and IV (Rehabilitation).
*   ***Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. ASB Holdings, Inc. (G.R. No. 166197):*** This case (decided by the First Division) involved similar issues concerning the same Rehabilitation Plan, and the Supreme Court decision in this case was relied upon in the present case.  Specifically, the Court adopted the First Division's ruling that approval of the Rehabilitation Plan does not impair the bank's liens over mortgaged properties but merely suspends actions for claims.
*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court (G.R. No. 74851):** This case was cited regarding the limited effect of the suspension of payments.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Technical Insolvency vs. Actual Insolvency:**  Petitioners argued that ASB Group was not "technically insolvent" under Section 3-12 of the Rules of Procedure on Corporate Recovery, as they had not first filed a petition for suspension of payments. The Supreme Court rejected this interpretation, clarifying that a corporation may directly file a petition for rehabilitation if it foresees an inability to meet obligations for longer than one year.
*   **Motion to Override Creditors' Objections:** Section 4-20 of the Rules requires a "motion" to override creditors' objections to a Rehabilitation Plan. While the ASB Group did not file a formal motion, they filed a "reply" to the opposition. The Court deemed this reply as sufficient compliance, considering the liberal interpretation of procedural rules.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** The Petitioners alleged a denial of due process due to the SEC's actions and delays. However, the Court found that the Petitioners had been given sufficient opportunity to be heard.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **denied** the petition and affirmed the CA's decision upholding the SEC's approval of the ASB Group's Rehabilitation Plan.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   A technically insolvent corporation (one that has sufficient assets but foresees an inability to pay obligations for >1 year) can directly file for rehabilitation without first filing for suspension of payments.
*   The approval of a Rehabilitation Plan does not necessarily constitute an impairment of contract, as it may merely suspend the enforcement of rights, not extinguish them.
*   While a motion to override creditors' objections is required under Sec. 4-20, substantial compliance with procedural rules may suffice.
