## Legal Document Summary: *Oronce v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125766, October 19, 1998*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision that nullified MTC and RTC decisions in an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Issue:** Jurisdiction of the MTC in ejectment cases where ownership is raised as a defense, specifically concerning a Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage later alleged to be an equitable mortgage.

**Facts:**

*   Private Respondent (PBGDC) mortgaged property to China Banking Corp.
*   PBGDC executed a Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage in favor of Petitioners (Oronce and Flaminiano) for P5.4M (allegedly less than the property's value). The Deed stipulated PBGDC would retain possession for one year.
*   Petitioners paid PBGDC's debt to the bank and obtained a new title.
*   PBGDC failed to deliver possession after one year, leading Petitioners to file an unlawful detainer suit in MTC.
*   PBGDC argued the deed was an equitable mortgage, not a sale, citing inadequate price and continued possession. They also filed a separate action for reformation of instrument.
*   MTC ruled for Petitioners, finding them owners based on the title, bank payments, and tax declarations.
*   RTC affirmed.
*   CA reversed, holding the MTC lacked jurisdiction because the dispute hinged on ownership (citing *General Insurance and Surety Corporation v. Castelo, 13 SCRA 652 (1965)*).  The CA also held that the action for reformation of the instrument was evidence that ownership was the key issue, and that the MTC should have deferred to the reformation action. The CA also rejected the argument that PBGDC was estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of the MTC, citing *La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 78 (1994)*.
*   During the appeal, Petitioners allegedly forcefully entered the property, leading to contempt charges.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage:**  Purported to transfer ownership to Petitioners, with PBGDC obligated to deliver possession after one year. Contained provision for petitioners to assume the mortgage obligation of Vendor.
*   **PBGDC's Obligation:**  To deliver possession and warranty of title.
*   **Petitioners' Obligation:** To pay the mortgage obligation to China Banking Corporation and the sales price of the property.
*   **Civil Code Art. 1602 & 1604:** Presumption of equitable mortgage in certain circumstances, even with an absolute sale.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Held in contempt for forcefully entering the property during litigation and are now legally restrained from entering the property.
*   **Attorney Flaminiano (Petitioner's husband):** Found to have committed acts unbecoming a member of the Philippine Bar and ordered to pay 25k fine for contempt of court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Characterization of the Deed:**  The central issue is whether the Deed of Sale is truly a sale or an equitable mortgage, triggering different legal consequences. The document itself contains indicators of equitable mortgage as described in Article 1602 of the Civil Code (continued possession, retention of part of purchase price).
*   **Impact of Dismissal of Reformation Action:** Although the Reformation Action was dismissed due to private respondent's failure to attend a pre-trial, this dismissal does not address the underlying issues of the validity of the Deed and the intention of the parties involved.
*   **Jurisdictional Issue:**  The CA incorrectly ruled that the MTC lacked jurisdiction. *Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 33* gives the MTC authority to resolve issues of ownership for the *sole purpose* of resolving possession. The Court here points out, that in the instant case, the lower court's duty was to make a provisional ruling on the issue of ownership.
*   **Contempt Charges:** The contempt charges suggest a disregard for court orders and the legal process, which could lead to further sanctions.
*   **Property Rights:**  The ultimate ownership of the property remains unresolved, posing a risk of further litigation (*Hilario v. Court of Appeals* states that judgement in forcible entry or detainer cases are only effective with respect to the possession of the land, and in no way affect the ownership of the property).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Hilario v. Court of Appeals, 329 Phil. 202 (1996):**  Deals with the MTC jurisdiction in ejectment cases involving ownership disputes.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 33:**  Judiciary Reorganization Act, conferring jurisdiction over ejectment cases and the power to resolve ownership for purposes of possession.
*   **Republic Act No. 7691:** Expansion of MTC Jurisdiction
*   **General Insurance and Surety Corporation v. Castelo, 13 SCRA 652 (1965):** CA wrongly cited this case because the court was aware of the pendency of the reformation action.
*   **La Naval Drug Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 236 SCRA 78 (1994):** CA wrongly cited this case because the court was aware of the pendency of the reformation action.
*   **Refugia v. Court of Appeals, 327 Phil. 982 (1996):** Guidelines for inferior courts in resolving ownership in ejectment cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Paragraph (c) of the Deed:**  The stipulation that possession remains with PBGDC for one year could be interpreted in different ways â€“ either as evidence of an equitable mortgage or as a fixed-term leaseback agreement.
*   **Paragraph (f) of the Deed:** "Full title and possession over the above-described property shall vest upon the VENDEES upon the full compliance by them with all the terms and conditions herein set forth." -- This clause casts doubt over the intent of the parties, and implies that the Petitioners had not yet fully complied with the terms of the agreement.

**Holding:** The Court DENIED the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The CA decision was AFFIRMED, upholding its decision in the ejectment case. The court also made the temporary restraining order permanent, held Petitioners in contempt of court and fined them and their council/husband.

**Legal Analysis & Implications:** The Court found that, because two elements of Article 1602 were explicitly listed in the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage, it should be considered as an Equitable Mortgage rather than an actual sale.
