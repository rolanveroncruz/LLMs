Okay, here is a summary of the provided legal document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Enrica Quevada vs. Pomposa Glorioso*, G.R. No. 121270, August 27, 1998, 356 Phil. 105

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership of one-half of a parcel of land (827 sq. m.) originally registered under OCT No. 8204 in the name of Antonio Cerrudo.

**Key Issue:** Validity of a 1948 CFI Order allowing inscription on the title reflecting Gregoria Cerrudo's alleged ownership of half the land based on a 1931 private document.

**Facts:**

*   **Origin:** Antonio Cerrudo registered the land in his name in 1925, after his death. His heirs were his wife, Pomposa Glorioso, and son, Pablo Cerrudo.
*   **1931 Document:** Pablo allegedly ceded ½ of the property to his aunt, Gregoria Cerrudo (Antonio’s sister), via a public instrument.  This document was not immediately registered.
*   **1948 Petition and Order:** Gregoria Cerrudo filed a "Petition for Inscription" in 1948 based on the 1931 document and a "Joint Affidavit" by Pablo's widow (Roberta Nañez) and mother (Pomposa Glorioso). The CFI granted the petition, and an annotation was made on OCT No. 8204.
*   **1978 Sale:** Gregoria Cerrudo sold her alleged share to the Quevadas (Enrica and spouses Cirilo & Angelina).
*   **Cerrudos' Claim:** Estelito, Manolito, and Adorado Cerrudo (Pablo's sons) sued to nullify the 1948 CFI Order, the 1931 document, and the 1978 sale, claiming the order was issued without jurisdiction.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** Ruled in favor of the Cerrudos, declaring the 1948 Order and the 1978 sale void.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the trial court, except for directing the Register of Deeds to cancel entries (since the Register of Deeds was not a party). Held that the "Petition for Inscription" was an improper remedy, and that an action for reconveyance would have been prescribed.
* The Supreme Court affirmed Court of Appeals decision

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **OCT No. 8204:** Original Certificate of Title is central to determining ownership. The validity of annotations to this title is the core dispute.
*   **1931 Public Instrument:**  The legal effect and admissibility of this document is questionable. The Supreme Court found it did not validly transfer title.
*   **1948 CFI Order:** The core determination is whether the CFI had jurisdiction to order the inscription based on the "Petition for Inscription" under what is now Section 108 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (formerly Section 112 of the Land Registration Act).
*   **1978 Deed of Sale:** Dependent on the validity of Gregoria's title.

**Liabilities:**

*   Quevadas ordered to vacate the land and pay rent from June 1978.
*   Quevadas ordered to pay attorney's fees and litigation costs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses/Contentious Points:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The main issue is the CFI's jurisdiction to act on the "Petition for Inscription." The Supreme Court found the petition was an improper remedy because it involved a substantial controversy over ownership, which cannot be resolved in a summary Section 108/112 proceeding.
*   **Lack of Due Process:** The Cerrudo brothers (Pablo's heirs) were minors at the time of the 1948 proceedings and were not properly represented. This raises due process concerns.
*   **Laches:** While the Court of Appeals raised laches as a potential bar to Gregoria's claim, the Supreme Court focused on the jurisdictional defect of the 1948 Order and lack of consent from all parties.
*   **Possession:**  The Quevadas' possession was initially tolerated, which prevented prescription from running against the Cerrudos.  The point at which tolerance ended is critical for determining the start of the rental obligation.
*   **Nature of Claim:** Gregoria's claim was based on alleged co-inheritance, which requires a more formal proceeding than a simple inscription under Section 108/112.
*   **Ambiguity:** The exact location of the boundary between the one-half ownership is not properly laid out in the original document.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 108:** (Formerly Land Registration Act, Section 112) Governs alterations and amendments to certificates of title. The case hinges on whether the CFI's action fell within the scope of this section.
*   **Faja vs. Court of Appeals:** Distinguished because it involved an action to quiet title based on possession, unlike the "Petition for Inscription" in this case.
*   **Article 526, Civil Code:** possessor in bad faith
*   **Article 549, Civil Code:** Reimbursement of the fruits received by the possessor in bad faith
*   **Bishop vs. Court of Appeals:** Re: tolerance and demand of property.

**Legal Analysis and Risks for Quevada:**

The core risk for the Quevadas is the invalidity of the 1948 CFI Order. Because the order was deemed to be issued without jurisdiction due to the nature of the land ownership dispute, the 1978 Deed of Sale from Gregoria is rendered void because Gregoria held no right to the property.  Their possession is deemed to have been merely tolerated, which prevents them from claiming ownership by prescription. The Quevadas are liable for rent and must vacate the property.
