Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Rolando De Roca vs. Eduardo C. Dabuyan, et al.*, G.R. No. 215281, March 05, 2018 (827 Phil. 98)

**Summary:**

This case involves a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by private respondents (Dabuyan, et al.) against petitioner Rolando De Roca, Victoriano Ewayan, and RAF Mansion Hotel (both old and new management).  The central issue is whether De Roca, the owner of the building where the hotel was located, was the employer of the respondents. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, finding that De Roca was *not* the employer and therefore not liable for illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Lack of Employer-Employee Relationship:** The SC held that there was no employer-employee relationship between De Roca and the respondents. De Roca merely leased the RAF Mansion Hotel building to Victoriano Ewayan's Oceanic Travel and Tour Agency.
*   **Contract of Lease:** The presence of a lease agreement between De Roca and Oceanic was crucial evidence demonstrating that Oceanic (Ewayan) operated the hotel as a lessee, independent of De Roca's ownership of the property.
*   **Amendment to Complaint:** The fact that De Roca was not originally named as a respondent and was only impleaded later, under the pretense of being the "new management," suggested that the respondents realized later that their true employer has absconded.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The Court noted that holding De Roca liable would result in unjust enrichment for the respondents as he was not a party to the employment contracts and did not receive any benefit from the employees' services.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **No Liability for De Roca:** The SC expressly absolved De Roca of any liability for the illegal dismissal claims.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents' Claims Against Ewayan/Oceanic:** The decision does not preclude the respondents from pursuing their claims against their actual employer, Victoriano Ewayan and Oceanic Travel and Tour Agency.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1311 of the Civil Code:**  Emphasizes that contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns, and heirs, and not third parties like De Roca.
*   **Principle of Unjust Enrichment:** Prevent one person from unfairly benefitting at another's expense, which would occur here if De Roca were forced to pay claims arising from Ewayan's employment of the respondents.
*   **Relaxation of procedural rules in Labor Cases**: Referencing jurisprudence that prioritizes substance over technicalities, especially when strict application of procedural rules would result in a miscarriage of justice.  *Coronel v. Hon. Desierto, 448 Phil. 894, 903 (2003).*
*   **Saldana v. Court of Appeals, 268 Phil. 424, 432 (1990). and Imperial v. Armes, G.R. Nos. 178842 & 195509, January 30, 2017** Discusses the nature of Void Judgments and legal effect on such nature.
*   **2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, Rule V, Section 2, and Rule VII, Section 10** - Emphasized on proceedings before the Labor Arbiter shall be non-litigious in nature and technical rules not binding.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"New Management" Designation:** The respondents' designation of De Roca as the "new management" was contentious. The SC rejected this argument, finding that De Roca's mere ownership of the building did not make him the successor-employer liable for the obligations of the previous lessee.

**Conclusion:**

The SC's decision hinged on the absence of an employer-employee relationship between De Roca and the respondents. The existence of the lease agreement, coupled with the respondents' initial failure to implead De Roca, strongly supported the conclusion that De Roca was merely the lessor and not responsible for the labor obligations of the hotel's operator, Ewayan.
