    *   Interest at 6% per annum from the date of judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Alibi Defense:**  The Court rejected Balais' alibi due to its inherent weakness and the physical possibility of him being at the crime scene. The alibi did not preclude his presence at the locus criminis.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The Court upheld treachery as the qualifying circumstance, emphasizing the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, rendering the victim unable to defend himself. The numerous wounds indicate deliberate means to ensure the victim could not retaliate.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** While the RTC initially considered nighttime and conspiracy as aggravating circumstances, both the CA and SC correctly discarded these. There was no evidence that the accused deliberately sought nighttime. Also, the Court mentioned that nocturnity is absorbed by alevosia.

**Analysis for Legal Professionals:**

This case affirms settled principles regarding alibi, treachery, and the imposition of penalties for murder. The rejection of the alibi reinforces the importance of credible eyewitness testimony and the need to establish the physical impossibility of the accused's presence at the crime scene. The Court's analysis of treachery highlights the focus on the manner of attack and the victim's inability to defend themselves, regardless of whether the attack was frontal.  The case clarifies that nighttime is not an aggravating circumstance per se, unless deliberately sought to facilitate the crime. The awards for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages are consistent with prevailing jurisprudence and aim to compensate the victim's heirs for the loss and suffering caused by the crime.
