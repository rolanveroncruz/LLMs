**Summary of *Irene Rayos-Ombac v. Atty. Orlando A. Rayos*, A.C. No. 2884, January 28, 1998**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Entrustment of Funds:** Complainant (Ombac), an 85-year-old woman, entrusted P588,000.00 to her nephew, Respondent (Atty. Rayos), for safekeeping based on his advice regarding her deceased husband's estate.
*   **Deposit Arrangement:** Respondent deposited the funds in a Union Bank time deposit in his wife's name, in trust for multiple beneficiaries.
*   **Repayment Agreement:** Respondent initially promised repayment with interest but later defaulted. A Memorandum of Agreement was executed where respondent agreed to repay only P400,000.00 in installments and acknowledged the balance of P188,000.00 as his indebtedness.
*   **Dishonored Checks:** Checks issued by Respondent to satisfy the P400,000.00 repayment were repeatedly dishonored due to insufficient funds.
*   **Subsequent Legal Actions:** Respondent initiated various legal actions against Complainant, including estafa and falsification charges, and intervention in the settlement of the estate of the Complainant's husband.
*   **Disbarment Complaint:** Complainant filed a disbarment complaint based on deceit and harassment.
*  **Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP):** The IBP initially recommended a two-year suspension, which the Supreme Court found too lenient given the offense.
*   **Withdrawal Affidavit:** Complainant executed an affidavit attempting to withdraw the disbarment complaint, which the Court deemed irrelevant.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's Obligation:** Respondent had a fiduciary duty to Complainant regarding the entrusted funds, which he violated by failing to return the money as promised and engaging in deceitful conduct. He also has a financial obligation to pay the P188,000 still owed.
*   **Professional Responsibility:** The central issue is Respondent's violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically Rule 1.01 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct) and Rule 1.03 (corrupt motive to encourage or delay suits).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Memorandum of Agreement:** The enforceability of the Memorandum of Agreement is questionable, particularly Paragraph 3 regarding the P188,000.00 debt, given the circumstances surrounding its execution and the power imbalance between the parties. Duress/Undue Influence arguments could be raised.
*   **Impact of Criminal Charges:** The dismissed estafa charges and the numerous suits against Complainant could have a bearing on the court's perception of Respondent's character and intentions.
*   **Withdrawal Affidavit:** The Court correctly deemed the withdrawal affidavit as inconsequential to the disbarment proceedings, as they are for public welfare and not private redress.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rule 1.01 and 1.03:** These rules are the foundation for the disbarment action.
*   **Rule 139-B, Section 20:** Governs the transfer of the cases to the IBP for disposition.
*   **Igual v. Javier, 254 SCRA 416 (1996):** Good moral character is a continuous requirement for maintaining good standing in the profession.
*   **Tejada v. Hernando, 208 SCRA 517 (1992):** Disbarment proceedings can continue despite desistance of complainant.
*   **De Vera v. Pineda, 213 SCRA 434 (1992):** Disciplinary proceedings serve the public welfare.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Rayos, finding his actions demonstrated a fundamental lack of the honesty and integrity required of members of the bar. The Court emphasized that the Respondent's misconduct constituted a grave violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, rendering him unfit to continue practicing law. The case underscores the fiduciary duties owed by lawyers to their clients and the severe consequences of abusing that trust. The fact that the complainant tried to withdraw the case holds no bearing to the severity of what occurred.
