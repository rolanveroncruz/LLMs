## Legal Document Summary: *AMA Computer College-Santiago City, Inc. vs. Chelly P. Nacino* (G.R. No. 162739)

**Type:** Resolution regarding procedure for appealing a Voluntary Arbitrator's decision.

**Key Issue:** The central issue is whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in dismissing AMA's Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) contesting a Voluntary Arbitrator's (VA) decision regarding the illegal suspension and termination of Chelly P. Nacino. The CA ruled that the proper remedy was an appeal via Rule 43, not a Petition for Certiorari.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** AMA terminated Nacino's employment. Nacino filed a complaint, and the parties initially agreed to a Compromise Agreement. However, AMA failed to pay the agreed amount. Nacino died, and the VA proceeded to decide the case, ordering reinstatement, backwages, and 13th-month pay. AMA filed a Petition for Certiorari, which the CA dismissed.
*   **Procedural Posture:** AMA filed a Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) to the CA, arguing grave abuse of discretion by the VA. The CA dismissed, stating the proper remedy was an appeal under Rule 43.
*   **Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's dismissal, holding that decisions of Voluntary Arbitrators are appealable to the Court of Appeals under Rule 43, citing *Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees* (249 SCRA 162 (1995)).
*   **Rationale:** The SC reasoned that VA decisions are akin to those of the Regional Trial Court and should be appealed to the CA before being elevated to the SC. The SC also noted AMA's failure to file the Petition for Certiorari within the 15-day reglementary period for Rule 43 appeals.

**Obligations:**

*   AMA had an obligation to appeal the VA's decision to the CA via Rule 43 within the prescribed 15-day period.

**Liabilities:**

*   Because AMA used the wrong procedure for filing the appeal, they are now liable for the VA decision. This could mean reinstating Nacino (which is now impossible since he is deceased) and paying backwages and 13th-month pay to his heirs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Decision:** The SC emphasized that the VA's decision is now final and executory due to AMA's procedural error.
*   **Enforcement of VA Decision:** The heirs of Nacino can enforce the VA's decision, including garnishing AMA's assets.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 43 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Specifies the procedure for appealing decisions of quasi-judicial agencies, including Voluntary Arbitrators.
*   **Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees (249 SCRA 162 (1995)):** Established that decisions of Voluntary Arbitrators are appealable to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. (BP) 129 Section 9:** Provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.
*   **Labor Code of the Philippines**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The text contains several references to filing dates and deadlines. Lawyers should review the precise timing of the events and filings to confirm the accuracy of these dates.

**Recommendations:**

*   Because the deadlines have passed, legal action is unlikely to succeed. It might be best to try to negotiate with the heirs to lower the amount they are demanding.
