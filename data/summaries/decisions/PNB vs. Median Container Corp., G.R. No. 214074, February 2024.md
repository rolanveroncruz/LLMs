**Case:** *Philippine National Bank vs. Median Container Corporation and Eldon Industrial Corporation* G.R. No. 214074, February 5, 2024

**Summary:**

PNB filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision which affirmed the RTC's dismissal (without prejudice) of PNB's counterclaim and denial of its motion to implead Spouses Ley. The core issue is whether PNB's counterclaim for collection of PHP 31,059,616.29, representing respondents' debt under trust receipts, is compulsory or permissive in respondents' action for reformation of those same instruments. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that the counterclaim is permissive, affirming the CA and RTC decisions.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Respondents' Claim:** Reformation of Instrument - Respondents (Median & Eldon) allege that trust receipts were signed under duress and did not reflect their true agreement (a loan) with PNB for a credit line.
*   **PNB's Counterclaim:** Collection of Sum of Money - PNB argues the trust receipts accurately reflect the agreement and seeks payment of the outstanding debt (PHP 31,059,616.29), impleading Spouses Ley (officers of Median) as solidarily liable.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Dismissed PNB's counterclaim without prejudice for failure to pay docket fees and submit a certificate of non-forum shopping, requisites for permissive counterclaims. Also denied the motion to implead.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC, holding the counterclaim was permissive as evidence and issues differ substantially from the reformation action. PNB can file a separate collection suit.
*   **SC Ruling:** Affirmed CA, holding the counterclaim is permissive because the issues of fact and law, and evidence needed for the claim and counterclaim are substantially different. The outcome of the reformation action will not necessarily bar a separate collection suit. Failure to pay docket fees and submit a certificate of non-forum shopping warranted dismissal.

**Legal Analysis & Case Law:**

*   **Compulsory vs. Permissive Counterclaim:** The court applied the tests established in *Lasala v. National Food Authority* and *Korea Exchange Bank v. Gonzales* to determine if the claim arose out of the same transaction or occurrence, if the same evidence would support or refute each claim, and if res judicata would apply. It also uses the "compelling test of compulsoriness".
*   **Docket Fees & Non-Forum Shopping:** Failure to comply with the requirements for initiatory pleadings (payment of docket fees, certificate of non-forum shopping) in a permissive counterclaim deprives the court of jurisdiction (*Southstar Construction and Development Corporation v. Philippine Estates Corporation*).
*   **Reformation of Instrument:** The SC references *Spouses Rosario v. Alvar* in explaining that Reformation is a remedy that allows a written instrument to be reformed to express or conform to the real intention of the parties.
*   **Dissenting Opinion (Lazaro-Javier, J.):** Argues the counterclaim *is* compulsory, citing *Gojo v. Goyala* and *Spouses Abines v. Bank of the Philippine Islands*.  *Gojo* states that the reformation of an instrument is a compulsory counterclaim to a case alleging the fulfillment of conditions in a contract such as the expiration of a right to repurchase because both actions arise out of, or are necessarily connected with, the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the complaint. *Abines* holds that a judgment in a collection case would be res judicata in the reformation case.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Classification of Counterclaim:** The core disagreement hinges on whether PNB's counterclaim is compulsory or permissive. The dissenting justice's reliance on *Gojo* and *Abines* highlights the potential for a different interpretation.
*   **Missed Opportunity to Cure:** PNB argues it was not given a chance to pay docket fees. This argument surfaced late in the proceedings, potentially weakening its position. The ruling does not address whether PNB could still file a separate action to collect, given statutes of limitations and other defenses.
*   **Impleading Spouses Ley:** The denial of the motion to implead hinges directly on the dismissal of the counterclaim. If the counterclaim were deemed compulsory, the motion would likely be granted. Further, even without the RTC motion, PNB can file a complaint against the Spouses Ley on the strength of the alleged solidary obligatino under the Trust Receipts.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Median & Eldon):** Potentially liable for the debt under the trust receipts, the amount of which will be adjudicated in a separate action.
*   **PNB:** Must pursue a separate legal action to collect the debt.
*   **Spouses Ley:** Could be held jointly and severally liable for the obligations under the trust receipts IF PNB files a case against them.

**Further Investigation:**

*   Review the Trust Receipts in full to assess the extent of PNB's security interests and potential remedies.
*   Determine the statute of limitations for a collection action against the respondents and Spouses Ley.
*   Analyze the actual evidence available to both sides for the reformation action and the collection action to assess the strength of each party's position in separate litigation.
