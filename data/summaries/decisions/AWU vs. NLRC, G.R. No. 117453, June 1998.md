**Legal Document Summary: *Autobus Workers’ Union (AWU) and Ricardo Escanlar vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Mr. Robert Ong* (G.R. No. 117453, June 26, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition assailing the NLRC resolution affirming the Labor Arbiter's decision, which upheld the validity of Ricardo Escanlar’s dismissal.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Company Code of Discipline (Sec. 6):** Prohibits insulting, threatening, or disrespectful behavior towards supervisors/company officials. Violation warrants suspension up to termination based on severity.
*   **Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA):** Grants the company the right to transfer employees and make changes in duties.
*   **Labor Code (Art. 282):** Provides for termination of employees for just causes, including gross misconduct.

**Liabilities/Findings:**

*   **Dismissal upheld:** Escanlar's dismissal deemed valid due to gross misconduct (uttering offensive language and threats to a supervisor). Labor Arbiter and NLRC found just cause and procedural due process.
*   **No Unfair Labor Practice:** Allegation of union busting dismissed due to lack of substantial evidence linking Escanlar's dismissal to his union presidency. CBA in place prior to current incident, co-union officers not facing the same discipline, and no clear discriminatory motive.
*  **Financial Assistance:** Although dismissal was found legal, the Labor Arbiter ordered respondent to pay P5,000 as financial assistance.

**Procedural Issues:**

*   **Due Process:** The Court found no violation of procedural due process as Escanlar was notified of the charges, provided a written explanation, and given the opportunity to be heard at a formal hearing with counsel. Formal trial not required.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282:** Basis for termination for just cause, including gross misconduct.
*   **Substantial Evidence Rule:** Factual findings of the NLRC, particularly those aligning with the Labor Arbiter, will not be disturbed if supported by substantial evidence. *Belaunzaran vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 120038, December 23, 1996, 265 SCRA 800, 806*
*   **Management Prerogative:** Employers have the right to transfer and reassign employees according to business requirements. *Manila Electric Company vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 114129, October 24, 1996, 263 SCRA 531, 538*
*   **Due Process:** Notice and opportunity to be heard are essential elements. *China City Restaurant Corporation vs. NLRC, 217 SCRA 443, 449 (1993)*

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*  **"Gross Misconduct" Definition:** While the court found repeated utterances of obscenities constitute gross misconduct, the precise definition of "gross misconduct" can be a point of contention. The case hinges on the interpretation and application of the company's Code of Discipline.
* **Financial Assistance:** The award of financial assistance despite a valid dismissal may be a point of contention.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the validity of Escanlar’s dismissal. The decision emphasizes the importance of company rules, employee conduct, and management prerogative, while also upholding the requirements of procedural due process. However, the specific facts and the emphasis on deference to the NLRC's factual findings may limit the precedential value of this case.
