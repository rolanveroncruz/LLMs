Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Damacen Gabriel Cunanan a.k.a. "Ryan" v. People of the Philippines* G.R. No. 237116 (2018)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division (Perlas-Bernabe, J.)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Sections 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs) and 12 (Illegal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia), Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Facts:**

*   A search warrant (No. 05-2012) was issued based on information from a confidential asset and executed at the petitioner's residence, leading to the seizure of suspected shabu and drug paraphernalia.
*   Petitioner claims the evidence was planted and challenges the legality of the search warrant.
*   RTC convicted the Petitioner and CA affirmed the conviction with modification with respect to the charge of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs by increasing the fine imposed to P500,000.00.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

1.  **Validity of the Search Warrant:**
    *   **Issue:** Whether probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant. The petitioner argued the testimony of SPO4 Balolong relied on hearsay evidence.
    *   **Ruling:** The Court upheld the search warrant's validity. Probable cause was established via the confidential asset's "test buy," corroborating the police officer's testimony. The Court cited *People v. Tee* and *People v. Zen Hua* to support the reliance on informant information corroborated by surveillance. The court also noted that the determination of probable cause is afforded deference absent a showing to the contrary. The court stated that law enforcers cannot themselves be eyewitnesses to every crime.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Section 2, Article III of the Constitution (right against unreasonable searches and seizures); Section 5, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court (examination of complainant for search warrant).

2.  **Implementation of the Search Warrant:**
    *   **Issue:** Whether the manner of implementing the search warrant was proper (announcement of authority, etc.)
    *   **Ruling:** The Court found the implementation valid despite the petitioner's claims of irregularities. The court noted that, there is no precise form of words required.
    *   **Case Law:** The court accorded more probative weight and credence to the testimonies of the police officers who caught petitioner in flagrante delicto in possession of illegal drugs and paraphernalia during the conduct of a valid search, in the absence of evidence that they have been inspired by an improper or ill motive

3.  **Chain of Custody:**
    *   **Issue:** Whether the prosecution adequately established an unbroken chain of custody of the seized items.
    *   **Ruling:** The Court found irregularities compromising the integrity of the corpus delicti.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (chain of custody requirements).
    *   **Case Law:** *People v. Mendoza* (emphasizing the need for insulating presence of media/DOJ representatives during seizure and marking).
    *   **Specific Problems:**
        *   Inconsistencies in the number of plastic sachets allegedly recovered and their location.

**Decision:**

The petition was deemed meritorious.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:**  The inconsistencies regarding the number of sachets, where they were recovered, and the discrepancies in the weights create significant reasonable doubt.
*   **Section 21 Compliance:** The lack of proper documentation and discrepancies in testimonies regarding key steps in the chain of custody expose potential challenges to the admissibility of the seized evidence.

**Note:** This summary focuses on the legal aspects of the document. A full assessment would require examining the complete trial transcripts and evidence.
