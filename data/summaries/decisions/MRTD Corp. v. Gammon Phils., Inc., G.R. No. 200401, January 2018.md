**Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 200401, *Metro Rail Transit Development Corporation v. Gammon Philippines, Inc.* (2018)**

**Nature of the Document:** A Supreme Court decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) decision, awarding Gammon Philippines, Inc. monetary claims for breach of contract.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Perfection of Contract:** The central issue is whether a perfected construction contract existed between MRT (petitioner) and Gammon (respondent) for the MRT-3 North Triangle Podium Structure project. The Court held that a perfected contract existed, finding MRT accepted Gammon's bid through the First Notice to Proceed. The Court rejected MRT's argument that the offer was revoked prior to acceptance, emphasizing Gammon's actions indicating acceptance (signing/returning the notice, mobilizing resources). The Court held that a temporary suspension of the project did not revoke the contract.
*   **Application of *Gammon v. MRT* Law of the Case:** MRT argued that the prior Supreme Court decision (516 Phil. 561) only addressed CIAC jurisdiction and not the contract's existence. The Court disagreed, applying the doctrine of the law of the case. The court deemed that the prior ruling, upholding CIAC's jurisdiction, implicitly affirmed the existence of a construction contract containing an arbitration clause.
*   **Judicial Admission:** MRT admitted in its Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim its willingness to pay Gammon P5,493,639.27 for engineering services, de-watering, and clean-up. MRT argued it was willing to pay *if proven*, implying a need for receipts. The Court held this admission to be binding and not contradicted by palpable mistake, precluding MRT from denying liability for this amount, even without submission of official receipts.
*   **Proof of Damages:** MRT contested CIAC award for both reimbursement of actual cost and lost profits.
    *   Actual Cost: MRT argued that invoices and debit notes are insufficient proof for actual damages claim.
    *   Lost Profit: MRT challenged the award for lost profits (5% of contract value), arguing the lack of expertise by Gammon's witness and the absence of definitive contract.
    The Court affirmed CIAC and Court of Appeals decisions, stating it would not re-examine CIAC factual findings which it has expertise in, and technical rules of evidence do not control arbitral proceedings.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   MRT is obligated to pay Gammon P5,493,639.27 for engineering services, design work, and site de-watering and clean-up, based on the judicial admission in its Answer.
*   MRT is liable for lost profits (P53,149,330.35) due to its breach of contract by awarding the construction to another contractor.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The finding of a perfected contract despite the absence of a fully executed formal contract document is a risk for parties seeking to avoid contractual obligations based on technicalities.
*   Reliance on internal calculations as evidence, as opposed to more formal financial statements, may open to challenge in future cases if the facts differ.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles:** 1305 (definition of contract), 1315 (perfection of contract), 1318 (requisites of contract), 1319 (consent), 2199 (actual damages), 2200 (lost profits).
*   **Construction Industry Arbitration Law (EO 1008):** Establishes CIAC jurisdiction over construction disputes.
*   **Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004 (RA 9285):** Reinforces the role of CIAC in construction arbitration.

*   ***CE Construction v. Araneta*** **(G.R. No. 192725, August 9, 2017):** Limits appeals from CIAC Arbitral Tribunals to questions of law.
*   ***International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. Chua*** **(730 Phil. 475 (2014):** Basic is the rule that to recover actual damages, not only must the amount of loss be capable of proof; it must also be actually proven with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised upon competent proof or the best evidence obtainable.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts, holding that a perfected contract existed, Gammon had proven its damages, and MRT was bound by its prior admission. The decision emphasizes the binding nature of CIAC factual findings, the separate existence of agreement to arbitrate, and provides clarity of when contracts in the construction industry are perfected, particularly within the sphere of bidding contracts.
