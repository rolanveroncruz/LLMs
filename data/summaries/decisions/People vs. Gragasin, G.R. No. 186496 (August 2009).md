## Legal Document Summary: People v. Gragasin, G.R. No. 186496

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Dante Gragasin y Par*, G.R. No. 186496, August 27, 2009

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Dante Gragasin for Rape under Article 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353.

**Facts:** The accused-appellant, Dante Gragasin, was charged with raping AAA, a 9-year-old girl. The RTC convicted him based on AAA's testimony. The CA affirmed but modified the damages awarded.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Rape (Art. 266-A, RPC, as amended):** The court affirms that sexual intercourse occurred. Because AAA was under 12, force and consent are immaterial.
*   **Statutory Rape (Art. 266-A(1)(d), RPC):**  The accused was found guilty of statutory rape because the victim was under 12 years old. Proof of sexual intercourse is the only requirement for conviction.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The courts gave credence to the victim's testimony, emphasizing her directness, consistency, and the inclination of courts to believe young victims due to their vulnerability and the unlikely fabrication of such a serious accusation.
*   **Penetration:** The court emphasizes that penetration, however slight, is sufficient for consummated rape. Hymenal laceration is not an element (citing *People v. Palicte*, G.R. No. 101088). Lack of spermatozoa is not a bar to conviction (citing *People v. Dones*, 325 Phil. 173 (1996)).
*   **Alibi:** The court rejected the accused's alibi because his presence at the grandmother's house, where the crime allegedly occurred, was not physically impossible.
*   **Damages:** CA's award of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P75,000.00 as moral damages were MODIFIED to P50,000.00 each based on *People v. Sambrano*, 446 Phil. 145, as the case involved simple rape with no qualifying aggravating circumstances. Exemplary damages were deleted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Dante Gragasin):** Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dissenting Opinion (Carpio Morales, J.):**  Disagrees with the deletion of exemplary damages, arguing it should be awarded in rape cases involving minors to deter sexual abuse of children, citing *People v. Sia, People v. Wasit, and People v. Cruz*. This highlights a potential area for future appeals or reconsiderations, and shows the court is split on whether exemplary damages should be awarded in statutory rape cases.
