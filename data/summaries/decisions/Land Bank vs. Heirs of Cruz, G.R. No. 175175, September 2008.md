## Legal Document Summary: LBP v. Heirs of Eleuterio Cruz (G.R. No. 175175)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming an RTC/SAC decision on just compensation for land acquisition under agrarian reform.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP)
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Eleuterio Cruz (landowners)

**Subject Matter:** Determination of just compensation for 13.5550 hectares of unirrigated riceland in Cagayan, acquired under Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 27.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Acquisition:** Land was placed under Operation Land Transfer (OLT) program under P.D. No. 27. LBP initially valued the land at P106,935.76 based on P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 formula.
*   **Disagreement on Valuation:** Landowners rejected LBP's valuation, leading to PARAD (Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudicator) fixing compensation at P80,000/hectare.
*   **SAC/RTC Decision:** Affirmed PARAD's valuation, ordering LBP to pay P1,098,560.00. SAC also cited section 17 of RA No. 6657
*   **CA Decision:** Modified the SAC decision regarding the total area, adjusting it from 13.7320 hectares to 13.5550 hectares, but affirmed the P80,000/hectare valuation.
*   **LBP's Argument:** Argued that P.D. No. 27/E.O. No. 228 formula should apply, citing *LBP v. Hon. David C. Naval*, as the land was acquired under P.D. No. 27, with just compensation based on the value at the time of taking (1972). They advocated using the formula: Land Value = (2.5 x AGP x P35) x A.
*   **Court's Ruling:** P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 apply only suppletorily to R.A. No. 6657. Since the just compensation wasn't settled before R.A. No. 6657's enactment, its parameters apply, citing *Paris v. Alfeche* and *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad*.
*   **Application of R.A. 6657:** Emphasized Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and DAR's (Department of Agrarian Reform) rule-making power under Section 49, citing *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada* for the application of DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998.
*   **Remand:** The Supreme Court found that the PARAD's valuation (and its subsequent adoption by the SAC and CA) lacked evidentiary and legal basis. It reversed the CA decision and remanded the case to the RTC/SAC, directing the court to determine just compensation strictly in accordance with DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998.

**Obligations:**

*   LBP: Obligated to pay just compensation as determined by the RTC/SAC in accordance with DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998.
*   RTC/SAC: Obligated to re-determine the just compensation based on DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998, considering factors like Capitalized Net Income, Comparable Sales, and Market Value.

**Liabilities:**

*   LBP: Potential liability for interest on delayed payment of just compensation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The success of re-determination hinges on the availability of credible evidence regarding Capitalized Net Income, Comparable Sales, and Market Value, as required by DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998. Landowners bear the burden of proof.
*   **DAR A.O. 5, Series of 1998:** The application of this administrative order introduces potential disputes regarding its interpretation and application, as well as challenges to the valuation methodologies embedded within.
*   **Delay:** Further delay in the final determination and payment of just compensation is likely, increasing the potential interest liabilities for LBP.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 27:** Presidential Decree No. 27, decrees the emancipation of tenants from the bondage of the soil, transferring to them the ownership of the land they till and providing the instruments and mechanism therefor.
*   **E.O. No. 228:** Executive Order No. 228, declares full land ownership to qualified farmer beneficiaries covered by Presidential Decree No. 27, declaring the value of remaining unvalued rice and corn lands subject to P.D. No. 27.
*   **R.A. No. 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.
*   **Section 17, R.A. No. 6657:** Determination of just compensation factors to be considered.
*   **Section 49, R.A. No. 6657:** DAR's rule-making power.
*   **DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998:** Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Valuation of Lands Voluntarily Offered or Compulsorily Acquired.
*   ***Paris v. Alfeche***:  Jurisprudence clarifying the relationship between P.D. No. 27, E.O. No. 228, and R.A. No. 6657.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad***: Jurisprudence stating RA 6657 is especially imperative considering that just compensation should be the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada***: Case mandating the application of DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Sps. Banal***: Case ruling that the applicable formula in fixing just compensation is DAR A.O. No. 6, series of 1992, as amended by DAR A.O. No. 11, series of 1994.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Lim***: Case mandating the application of DAR A.O. No. 6, series of 1992, as amended by DAR A.O. No. 11, series of 1994.
*   ***Land Bank of the Philippines v. Hon. David C. Naval***: Case used by LBP to defend their use of the formula: Land Value = (2.5 x AGP x P35) x A

**Actionable Items:**

*   Prepare for a retrial before the RTC/SAC, focusing on gathering and presenting robust evidence to support a valuation consistent with DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998.
*   Scrutinize the potential application of other relevant DAR A.O.s.
*   Evaluate potential legal challenges to the application of DAR A.O. No. 5, series of 1998, itself.
