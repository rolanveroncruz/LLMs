**Case Summary: Rongavilla vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 83974, August 17, 1998 (355 Phil. 721)**

**Facts:** Private respondents (aunts) sued petitioners (niece and husband) to declare a Deed of Absolute Sale void, alleging fraud, misrepresentation, lack of consent, and lack of consideration.  Private respondents claimed they signed the document believing it was a receipt for a P2,000 loan.  The trial court and the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the private respondents, finding the deed void ab initio.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (Exh. "I"):** Declared void and inexistent. Petitioners were ordered to reconvey the property to the private respondents, free of liens, pay attorney's fees of P5,000, and costs of suit.
*   **Reconveyance:** Petitioners have an obligation to reconvey the property covered by TCT No. S-28903 to the private respondents.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for reconveying the property.
*   Petitioners are liable for attorney's fees and costs of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Title:**  The ruling effectively clouds the title acquired by the petitioners, potentially leading to further litigation if they fail to comply with the reconveyance order.
*   **Mortgage Implications:** The property was mortgaged to Cavite Development Bank by the petitioners. The status of this mortgage and its impact on the reconveyance is not explicitly addressed.
*   **Criminal Liability:** While not explicitly discussed, the fraud and misrepresentation findings could potentially expose the petitioners to criminal charges related to real estate fraud.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 24, Civil Code:**  Requires courts to be vigilant in protecting disadvantaged parties in contractual relations.
*   **Art. 1275, Old Civil Code (cited in *Ocejo, Perez & Co. vs. Flores, 40 Phil. 921*):** Contracts without cause or consideration are null and void.
*   **Art. 1410, Civil Code:** Action to declare the inexistence of void contracts does not prescribe.
*   ***Rivero v. Court of Appeals, 80 SCRA 411 (1977)***: Affirms nullification of deeds of sale obtained through fraudulent misrepresentation and gross inadequacy of consideration.
*   ***Ocejo, Perez & Co. vs. Flores, 40 Phil. 921 (1920)***:  Sale of land declared void due to lack of consideration.
*   ***Mapalo v. Mapalo, 17 SCRA 114 (1966)***:  Contracts without cause or consideration produce no effect.
*   ***Baranda v. Baranda, 150 SCRA 59 (1987)***:  Affirms that a deed of sale where consent was not given at all and consideration was lacking, the contract is void ab initio

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Consideration:**  The Deed stated P2,000, but petitioners claimed P7,800 was the actual consideration. This inconsistency significantly undermines the validity of the deed.
*   **Fraud and Misrepresentation:** The finding of fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining the private respondents' signatures is crucial to the ruling. The court found the petitioners' claim that the sale was a legitimate transaction as incredible.
*   **Prescription:** The petitioners' claim that the action had prescribed was rejected based on the finding that the contract was void ab initio, making the action imprescriptible under Art. 1410. *Pangadil v. CFI of Cotabato, 116 SCRA 347 (1982)* was distinguished.

**Overall Assessment:**

The court's decision heavily relies on the factual finding of fraud and misrepresentation by the petitioners. The absence of true consent and genuine consideration, coupled with the familial relationship and the private respondents' vulnerability due to age and lack of education, led the court to declare the Deed of Absolute Sale void ab initio. The ruling appears to be well-supported by the evidence and legal precedents cited.
