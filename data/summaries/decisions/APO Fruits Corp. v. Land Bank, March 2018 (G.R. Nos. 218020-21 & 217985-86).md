## Legal Document Summary: *Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines and Department of Agrarian Reform* (G.R. Nos. 217985-86 & 218020-21, March 21, 2018)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari regarding just compensation for land expropriated under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Expropriation:** Apo voluntarily offered land for sale under CARP, but disputed LBP's initial valuation. Despite Apo's rejection, TCT was cancelled and land transferred to the Republic, with CLOAs issued to farmer-beneficiaries.
*   **Just Compensation Dispute:** Apo filed for just compensation determination, initially with DARAB (unresolved for 6 years) then with the RTC (SAC).
*   **RTC Decision:** Adopted Commissioners' Report valuing land at Php 130.00 per sq m (P149,783,000.27 total). Awarded interest, commissioner's fees, attorney's fees.
*   **CA Decision:** Modified RTC, setting just compensation at Php 103.33 per sq m, with 12% interest only until May 9, 2008, and affirmed attorney's fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP):** Obligated to pay Apo Fruits Corporation just compensation for expropriated land. Liable for interest on unpaid balance and attorney's fees.
*   **Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR):** Jointly and severally liable with LBP for attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Dispute:** The core dispute revolves around the land valuation. LBP argues for a lower valuation based on agricultural use and DAR Administrative Order formulas (citing RA 6657, Section 17). Apo and the RTC argue for a higher valuation due to the land's location, potential for residential/industrial conversion, and comparable sales (supported by commissioner's report).
*   **Interest Calculation:** The period for interest accrual is contested.  Apo seeks interest from the date of taking (Dec 9, 1996) until full payment. LBP contests liability for interest citing initial payment of initial valuation for the subject property.
*   **Reliance on *Apo Fruits Corporation v. CA* (G.R. No. 164195):** The CA's reliance on the valuation in G.R. No. 164195 is problematic because it involved different parcels of land.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Award of attorney's fees despite the general rule against it, justified by LBP's unreasonable valuation and DARAB's inaction, potentially opening it up to appeals

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Governs expropriation and just compensation determination. Section 17 specifies factors for determining just compensation.
*   ***Apo Fruits Corporation v. CA* (G.R. No. 164195):** Cited by the CA but held not directly applicable due to different land parcels.

**Summary of the Ruling:**

The Supreme Court upheld just compensation of Php 130.00 per square meter, and imposes legal interest of 12% per annum counted from December 9, 1996, the time of the taking of the subject property, until June 30, 2013. Thereafter, a legal interest of 6% per annum is imposed counted from July 1, 2013 until full payment thereof.
