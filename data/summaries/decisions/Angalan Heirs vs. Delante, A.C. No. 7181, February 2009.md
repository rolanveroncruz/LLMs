## Legal Document Summary: *Maria Angalan, et al. vs. Atty. Leonido C. Delante* (A.C. No. 7181)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a disbarment proceeding against Atty. Leonido C. Delante.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Complaint:** Heirs of Angalan Samal (complainants) allege Atty. Delante (respondent) violated the Code of Professional Responsibility by taking advantage of their illiteracy and financial distress to acquire their land.
*   **Underlying Transaction:** Complainants initially mortgaged land to Spouses Eustaquio. The Spouses fraudulently converted the mortgage into an absolute sale.
*   **Respondent's Involvement:** Complainants hired Atty. Delante to recover the property. Atty. Delante filed a case, but ultimately acquired the title to the land himself, allegedly for a client from New York but failed to substantiate the claim.
*   **Amicable Settlement:** Complainants and Spouses Eustaquio entered into an amicable settlement for repurchase of the property. Atty. Delante advanced the funds for the repurchase but ultimately took title to the property under his name.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Delante denies being hired to recover the property, claims complainants sought only a loan referral, and alleges the purchase was for a client from New York.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 16, Code of Professional Responsibility:**  Lawyers must hold client property in trust.  Atty. Delante failed to return the property to the complainants upon demand.
*   **Canon 17, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Lawyers must be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in them. Atty. Delante took advantage of his clients' vulnerability.
*   **Rule 16.03, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Requires a lawyer to deliver the funds and property of his client when due or upon demand.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:**  Atty. Delante is found guilty of violating Canons 16 and 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and is disbarred. His name is stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Affidavit of Desistance:** The existence of a motion to withdraw the complaint and an affidavit of desistance filed by the complainants. However, the Court correctly notes that these are immaterial and will not interrupt or terminate the investigation, citing Section 5, Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court.
*   **Respondent's Unsubstantiated Client from New York:** Atty. Delante's claim of purchasing the property for a client from New York lacks supporting documentation, which discredits his defense.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canons 16 and 17:** The primary basis for the disbarment.
*   **Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court:** Pertains to disbarment or suspension of attorneys for gross misconduct.
*   **Rule 139-B, Section 5 of the Rules of Court:** No investigation shall be interrupted by reason of desistance, settlement, compromise, restitution, withdrawal of charges, or failure of the complainant to prosecute the same.
*   **Rule 139-B, Section 12(b) of the Rules of Court:**  Dictates the procedure for forwarding the case to the Supreme Court for final action after a recommendation of suspension or disbarment.
*   ***Hernandez v. Go, A.C. No. 1526, 31 January 2005, 450 SCRA 1:***  Cited as precedent for disbarring a lawyer who transferred client property to their name. This case underscores the gravity of the violation and supports the imposition of the ultimate penalty.
