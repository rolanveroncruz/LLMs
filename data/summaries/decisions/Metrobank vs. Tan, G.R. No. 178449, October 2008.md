## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Spouses Elisa Tan and Antonio Tan and Spouses Lilian Tan and Marcial See*, G.R. No. 178449, October 17, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision affirming the RTC's judgment in a case for Specific Performance, Injunction, and Damages related to a foreclosed property.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loans & Mortgages:** Multiple loans secured by a real estate mortgage executed by Spouses See over property under TCT No. 105233.  Initial loans were to Ylang-Ylang Merchandising (later Ajax Marketing), then Ajax Marketing & Development Corporation.  The mortgages secured these loans.
*   **Consolidated Loan:**  Three loans consolidated into Promissory Note (PN) No. BDS-3605 for P1,000,000.00, executed by Ajax Marketing and spouses Tan as solidary co-obligors.
*   **Foreclosure:** Metrobank foreclosed the mortgage due to default on PN No. BDS-3605.  Metrobank was the highest bidder at the public auction (P1,775,040.00).
*   **Annulment Suit (Civil Case No. 85-33933):** Ajax and Spouses See and Spouses Tan sued to annul the foreclosure, arguing novation. SC upheld the foreclosure in *Ajax Marketing & Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118585*. SC noted that the inclusion of an unsecured loan in the bid price was improper but did not invalidate the foreclosure.
*   **Redemption Attempts:** Spouses Tan attempted to redeem after the SC decision, but negotiations stalled over the redemption price. They offered P2MM to be paid in installments.
*   **Specific Performance Suit (Civil Case No. 97-85012):**  Spouses Tan and Spouses See sued for specific performance, seeking to redeem the property for P1,609,334.61. They alleged Metrobank frustrated their redemption attempts and fraudulently sold the property to others (initially referred to as "John and Peter Doe").
*   **Deed of Redemption and Reconveyance:** Spouses See (registered owners) purportedly redeemed the property for P11,500,000.00; however, Spouses Tan contested the validity of this redemption arguing that the said Spouses See and Lilian Tan did not truly sign the document.

**Obligations:**

*   **Mortgagors' (Spouses Tan) obligation:** To pay the loan under PN BDS-3605.
*   **Mortgagees' (Spouses See) obligation:** As registered owners of the property used as security for the loans of Spouses Tan to allow said property to answer for the unpaid debts.
*   **Metrobank's original obligation:** to honor a valid redemption, if tendered timely and for the correct amount. To return any surplus from the foreclosure sale if there was an improper inclusion of PN No. BDS-3583 in the bid price.

**Liabilities/Findings of the SC:**

*   The Court of Appeals erred in declaring that Metrobank must be legally capacitated to surrender possession and title to the subject property in order for it to be able to invoke the legal requirement of the law that there must be an actual tender or delivery of the redemption price for an offer to redeem to be binding.
*   The Court of Appeals erred when it declared that Respondent Spouses Antonio and Elisa Tan's tender and offer of redemption was within the one-year period starting from the registration of the certificate of sale considering that the redemption period was "freezed" when respondents were forced to file Civil Case No. 85-33933 on December 11, 1984 after their tender of the redemption price was refused by Metrobank and that the redemption period remained fresh and unexpired until Civil Case No. 85-33933 was finally adjudicated by the Supreme Court in September 1995.
*   The Court of Appeals erred in declaring that Metrobank is liable to pay respondents attorney's fees.
*   The Court of Appeals erred in declaring that the Trial Court was correct in submitting the case immediately for decision as there was unreasonable delay on the part of Metrobank in the presentation of its evidence.
*   *Spouses Tan failed to validly redeem:* No valid tender of the full redemption price within the one-year redemption period (counted from the registration of the certificate of sale).  The offer to pay in installments was insufficient, and there was no simultaneous tender of payment.
*   *Civil Case No. 85-33933 did not suspend the redemption period:* Actions to annul the foreclosure do not suspend the redemption period. *Conejero v. Court of Appeals*, 123 Phil. 605 (1966), *Daza v. Tomacruz*, 58 Phil. 414 (1933); *Sumerariz v. Development Bank of the Philippines*, 129 Phil. 641 (1967).
*   *The Deed of Redemption and Reconveyance was treated as a sale:* Because Spouses Tan failed to redeem, Metrobank had become the absolute owner and could sell to whomever it liked, under terms it sees fit. The transaction with the Sees was effectively a sale, not a redemption.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity surrounding the intent of the Sees' "redemption":** While the SC treated it as a sale, the initial documentation as a "Deed of Redemption" could create issues regarding intent.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded by lower courts but reversed by the Supreme Court.
*   **Valuation:** It is critical to note that the proceeds from the foreclosure sale should be applied to the outstanding loans plus interest, expenses, and charges related to the sale only, and Metrobank has the burden to return the surplus of the amount to the mortgagors.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Ajax Marketing & Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118585, 248 SCRA 222:* Validates the foreclosure but acknowledges impropriety of including unsecured loan in bid price.
*   *State Investment House, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 99308, 215 SCRA 734:* Discusses redemption principles and installment payments.  Cited by lower courts but distinguished by the SC.
*   *Eastman Chemical Industries v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 76733, 174 SCRA 619:* The one-year redemption period should be counted from the time the certificate of sale is registered with the Registry of Deeds.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law), as amended by RA 4118, Sec. 6:** Defines the redemption period and eligible redemptioners.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 13:** Defines "year" as 365 days.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, finding that Spouses Tan failed to validly redeem the property within the statutory period. The "redemption" by Spouses See was construed as a sale by Metrobank as the absolute owner. The SC emphasized the need for a valid tender of the full redemption price within the one-year period, rejecting the argument that the prior annulment suit tolled the redemption period. Metrobank ultimately prevailed, having properly consolidated ownership after the lapse of the redemption period.
