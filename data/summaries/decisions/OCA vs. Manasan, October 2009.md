## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator v. Alfredo Manasan*

**Case:** A.M. No. P-07-2415, October 19, 2009 (Formerly A.M. No. 07-10-279-MCTC)

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Office of the Court Administrator (OCA)
*   **Respondent:** Alfredo Manasan, Clerk of Court II, MCTC, Orani-Samal, Bataan

**Subject Matter:** Administrative case regarding unremitted court collections and non-compliance with Supreme Court resolutions.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Financial Audit:** The OCA conducted a financial audit of MCTC, Orani-Samal, covering July 1, 1999 to September 24, 2007. The audit revealed that from June 1, 2001 to September 24, 2007, the Respondent, as the Clerk of Court II, had unremitted collections totaling P83,110 across several funds (Judiciary Development Fund, Special Allowance for the Judiciary Fund, Fiduciary Fund, Mediation Fund, and Legal Research Fund).
*   **Explanation and Justifications:** The Respondent initially claimed the money was kept at home due to a past pickpocketing incident where he lost P60,000 of court funds. He eventually deposited the missing amounts but did so late (a week after the audit team left). He also failed to deposit the P2,000 to the Fiduciary Fund in a timely manner.
*   **Failure to Comply with Court Orders:** The Respondent failed to comply with the Supreme Court's Resolution of December 12, 2007, which directed him to submit a copy of the validated deposit slip for P2,000 to the Fiscal Monitoring Division, Court Management Office. His explanation was deemed "completely unsatisfactory" and a "cavalier attitude that mocks the lawful authority of this Court."
*   **OCA Recommendation:** The OCA recommended a fine of P5,000.00 for disobedience and defiance of the Court's Resolution and ordered to submit a copy of the deposit slip of the P2,000 to the Fiduciary Fund.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court adopted the OCA's recommendation, imposing a P5,000 fine and a suspension of one month and one day without pay for simple neglect of duty. The Court emphasized that its orders are not mere requests and must be obeyed promptly.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Remit Funds Promptly:** Clerks of Court are obligated to immediately deposit court funds; they are not authorized to keep the funds in their custody.
*   **Liability for Delayed Remittances:** Delay in depositing funds constitutes simple neglect of duty.
*   **Obligation to Comply with Court Orders:** Court officers and employees are duty-bound to obey court orders and processes.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misinterpretation of facts:** The respondent's explanation for the delay in depositing funds could have been found to be an excuse instead of a reasonable explanation.
*   **Incomplete compliance with court orders:** The partial or inadequate compliance with court resolutions is deemed as disrespectful to the Court.
*   **Escalation of penalties:** A repeat offense could result in more severe penalties, potentially including dismissal.

*   Whether the previous pickpocketing incident was truly a traumatic event that would prevent the individual from depositing money in the bank.
*   Whether the volume of work prevented the respondent from depositing the funds in a timely manner.
