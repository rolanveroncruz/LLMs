**Legal Document Summary: *Engr. Roger F. Borja vs. The People of the Philippines* G.R. No. 164298**

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing Engr. Borja's petition for certiorari, which sought to suspend arraignment in three criminal cases filed against him for violations of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The issue hinges on whether a prejudicial question existed, specifically, the classification of local water districts as private or government-owned or controlled corporations (GOCCs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019:** Borja, as General Manager of San Pablo Water District, is accused of:
    *   Granting unwarranted benefit to Teresita Rivera by retaining her as Division Manager despite revocation of her promotion by the Civil Service Commission (Criminal Case No. 13758-SP (02)).
    *   Using San Pablo City Water District funds to pay back wages to Evelyn Eje and Raquel Tolentino (Criminal Case Nos. 13759-SP (02) and 13760-SP (02)).

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   As a public officer, Borja is subject to the provisions of RA 3019, which prohibits corrupt practices.
*   The prosecution bears the burden of proving Borja acted with evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence, causing undue injury or giving unwarranted benefit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Criminal conviction under RA 3019, leading to imprisonment and other penalties.
*   Damage to reputation and potential disqualification from holding public office.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e):** Basis for the criminal charges against Borja.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 198 ("THE PROVINCIAL WATER UTILITIES ACT OF 1973"):**  Establishes the legal basis for local water districts.
*   **Feliciano v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 147402, 419 SCRA 363 (2004):**  Key case cited by Borja, arguing that the resolution of whether local water districts are GOCCs is a prejudicial question. The Supreme Court (SC) ruled in *Feliciano* that they are GOCCs.
*   **Hagonoy Water District v. NLRC, No. L-81490, August 31, 1988, 165 SCRA 272, 279; Davao City Water District v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. Nos. 95237-38, September 13, 1991, 201 SCRA 593, 606; Tanjay Water District v. Gabaton, G.R. No. 63742, April 17, 1989, 172 SCRA 253, 261:**  Cited by the CA in support of its finding that local water districts are GOCCs.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Evident Bad Faith, Manifest Partiality, or Gross Inexcusable Negligence:**  These elements under Section 3(e) of RA 3019 are subjective and require careful factual analysis. The prosecution must prove these elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Legal Analysis & Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's decision, finding no merit in Borja's argument for a prejudicial question. The SC emphasized that existing jurisprudence, including the *Feliciano* case, already established that local water districts are GOCCs, making Borja a public officer subject to RA 3019. Furthermore, the SC noted that Borja filed his petition after the *Feliciano* case was already decided, removing any basis for his argument.  The key takeaway is that the criminal cases against Borja can proceed based on his status as a public officer. The success of the prosecution hinges on proving the elements of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 in each of the three criminal cases.
