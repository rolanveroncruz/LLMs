## Legal Document Summary: *Monreal v. COMELEC* & *Foronda v. COMELEC* (G.R. Nos. 184935 & 184938)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for *certiorari* challenging COMELEC resolutions disqualifying petitioners from running for Punong Barangay based on the three-term limit rule in R.A. 9164, Sec. 2.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **R.A. 9164, Sec. 2:** Establishes a three-year term for barangay officials and a three-term limit, reckoned from the 1994 barangay elections.
*   **COMELEC Resolutions:** Disqualified Monreal and Foronda based on violation of the three-term limit rule.

**Core Issue:** Whether the pendency of a related case questioning the constitutionality of R.A. 9164, Sec. 2 (specifically the retroactive application of the three-term limit) constitutes a prejudicial question that should have suspended the COMELEC proceedings.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court DISMISSED the petitions, AFFIRMING the COMELEC resolutions.

**Key Arguments and Rationale:**

1.  **Prejudicial Question:** The Court held that the issue of constitutionality *was not* a prejudicial question warranting suspension of the disqualification proceedings. Cites *Quiambao v. Osorio* on the definition of prejudicial question.
2.  **Presumption of Constitutionality:** Laws are presumed constitutional until declared otherwise. Suspending the COMELEC proceedings would have acted as a preliminary injunction against R.A. 9164, Sec. 2. Cites *Macalintal v. COMELEC,* *People v. Leachon,* and *Social Security Commission v. Judge Bayona*.
3.  **Finality of RTC Decision:** The RTC decision declaring R.A. 9164, Sec. 2 unconstitutional was *not yet final* and had no executory order pending appeal, hence, the provision remained in full force.
4.  **Application of R.A. 9164, Sec. 2:** The Court cited *Laceda v. Limena* as a case where R.A. 9164, Sec. 2 was applied, indicating an understanding of its purpose to broaden electoral choice.
5.  **Second Placer Doctrine:** The Court applied the doctrine of rejection of the second placer, stating that since Foronda was a legally recognized candidate on election day, despite subsequent disqualification, the votes cast for him cannot be considered null and void. Cites *Cayat v. COMELEC*. Distinguishes from *Labo v. COMELEC*, which applies to instances where the winning candidate was never eligible in the first place.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners Monreal and Foronda are obligated to vacate their positions.

**Liabilities:**

*   No explicit liabilities beyond vacating office are mentioned.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Continued uncertainty if the RTC decision on constitutionality is ultimately upheld on appeal, though this decision indicates a strong presumption of constitutionality.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9164, Sec. 2** (Three-term limit for barangay officials)
*   **Quiambao v. Osorio** (Prejudicial Question)
*   **Macalintal v. COMELEC, People v. Leachon, Social Security Commission v. Judge Bayona** (Presumption of Constitutionality)
*   **Laceda v. Limena** (Application of R.A. 9164, Sec. 2)
*   **Cayat v. COMELEC** (Candidate Legality on Election Day)
*   **Labo v. COMELEC** (Second Placer Doctrine - distinguished)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The retroactive application of the three-term limit remains a contentious point, as evidenced by the RTC ruling (though ultimately ineffective in this case due to lack of finality). The Supreme Court emphasizes the presumptive validity of the law.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court prioritizes the presumption of constitutionality of R.A. 9164, Sec. 2 over the potentially prejudicial question of its constitutionality, and affirms the COMELEC's disqualification of the petitioners based on the three-term limit rule. The Court reinforces the principle that a lower court's ruling of unconstitutionality does not automatically invalidate a law while under appeal. The Court also clearly distinguished the application of the second placer doctrine, affirming its non-application to this case, reiterating that votes for a legally valid candidate, even if subsequently disqualified, should not be considered nullified.
