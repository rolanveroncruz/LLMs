## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-94-1257

This Supreme Court decision resolves an administrative case against Judge Antonio Mendez and Atty. Vicente Joyas stemming from Civil Case No. 2137-G (Specific Performance and Annulment of Sale with Injunction) filed in the RTC of Gumaca, Quezon. The complainants are Spouses Jose Sy Bang and Iluminada Tan.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Background:**  Dispute over ownership of properties originally owned by DBP, leased to Suarez Agro-Industrial Corporation, and subsequently sold to the Spouses Sy Bang. Prior ejectment suit filed by the spouses in MTC and a related case dismissed by the Court of Appeals for improper venue.
*   **Charge 1:** Failure to lift the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction after the Court of Appeals reversed the order granting it. (Relevant: *Rules of Court* regarding injunctions)
*   **Charge 2:** Failure to resolve the complainant’s motion to dissolve the writ despite the Plaridel Surety and Insurance Co.’s authority to operate as a bonding entity having been suspended. (Relevant: Section 4, Rule 58 *Rules of Court* requiring a valid bond for injunctions.)
*   **Charge 3:** Falsification of public document by inserting a fake bond from Country Bankers' Insurance Corporation into the civil case record to justify the continued effectivity of the injunction.

**Key Findings & Obligations:**

*   **Judge Mendez:** Reprimanded for inexcusable delay in resolving the motion to dissolve the writ of injunction after being notified of the invalidity of the original bond. This delay prejudiced the complainants, as the writ was not covered by a valid bond. (Relevant: *Dysico v. Dacumos, 262 SCRA 275 (1996); Ubarra v. Tecson, 134 SCRA 4 (1985)* regarding the importance of prompt resolution of motions.  Also, *Rule 3.05, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct*.)
*   **Atty. Joyas:** Cleared of liability concerning the fake bond, as there was no evidence to suggest his direct involvement or knowledge of its falsity.  He represented the Suarez Agro-Industrial Corporation.
*   **Investigation Ordered:**  The Office of the Court Administrator is directed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the fake bond, indicating a potential larger scheme of fake bond proliferation.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   Judge Mendez is reprimanded, which is noted in his record.  His retirement from the service doesn't moot the case.
*   Atty. Joyas faces no penalty.
*   Potential criminal liabilities may arise from the ongoing investigation regarding the fake bond.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision highlights the importance of judicial efficiency and promptness in resolving motions, emphasizing the need for a judge to act expeditiously, especially when the validity of court orders (like injunctions) is called into question.
*   The case reveals the potential for fraudulent activities, such as the filing of fake bonds, to undermine the integrity of judicial proceedings.
*   The lack of a clear record of the bond's filing (no accompanying pleading) raises questions about internal court procedures and controls, potentially opening the door to similar fraudulent practices. The absence of any documented filing of pleading or evidence of submission by Atty. Joyas could be ambiguous as to intent or negligence.
*   The ordered investigation may uncover broader implications regarding the prevalence of fake bonds and the involvement of other individuals or entities.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Rules of Court (Rule 58)**: Pertains to injunctions and requirements for valid bonds.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct (Rule 3.05, Canon 3)**: Mandates judges to dispose of court business promptly.
*   **Dysico v. Dacumos, 262 SCRA 275 (1996); Ubarra v. Tecson, 134 SCRA 4 (1985)**: Underscore the importance of timely resolution of pending incidents.
*   **Gallo v. Cordero, 245 SCRA 219 (1995); Zarate v. Romanillos, 242 SCRA 593 (1995); Raval v. Romero, 72 SCRA 172, 174 (1976):** Establishes jurisprudence on the Court's jurisdiction even after retirement of the respondent official.

This summary highlights the administrative liability of Judge Mendez for failing to act on a motion to dissolve an injunction with an invalid bond. The risk of fraudulent bonds is emphasized and further investigation ordered. The dismissal of the charges against Atty. Joyas is also noted.
