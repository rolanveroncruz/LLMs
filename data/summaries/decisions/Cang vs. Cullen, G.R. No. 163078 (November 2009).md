## Legal Document Summary: *Cang vs. Cullen*, G.R. No. 163078

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's reversal of the RTC's decision in a vehicular accident damages case.

**Key Facts:**

*   Taxicab owned by Stephen Cang, driven by George Nardo, involved in an accident with a motorcycle owned by Herminia Cullen, driven by Guillermo Saycon.
*   Conflicting accounts of the accident: Cullen alleges the taxi sideswiped the motorcycle; Cang alleges the motorcycle bumped the taxi.
*   Cullen paid Saycon's medical expenses and wages and is seeking reimbursement.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 2176 of the Civil Code:** Basis for claiming damages due to negligence.
*   **Article 2179 of the Civil Code:** Addresses contributory negligence and its impact on damages.
*   **Article 2180 of the Civil Code:** Addresses employer liability for the negligence of employees.
*   **Article 2185 of the Civil Code:** Creates presumption of negligence when a driver violates traffic regulations.
*   **Section 30 of RA 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code):** Regulations on student-driver permits. Saycon Violated this.

**Ruling of Lower Courts:**

*   **RTC:** Ruled in favor of Cang (defendants), dismissing Cullen's (plaintiff's) complaint and Cang's counterclaims. The RTC did not believe the plaintiff's witness.
*   **CA:** Reversed the RTC, ordering Cang and Nardo to pay Cullen for actual and exemplary damages.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   Grants Cang's Petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the RTC's decision.
*   The Court agreed with the RTC's assessment that Saycon was negligent because he drove alone with a student permit, wasn't wearing a helmet, and was speeding. The driver did not have the diligence required by the nature of the obligation and therefore the Plaintiff's complaint was dismissed.
*   The court emphasized that the CA failed to refute the trial court's detailed analysis of the events leading to the accident.

**Liabilities:**

*   No liability is imposed on Cang or Nardo.
*   Saycon held responsible for the accident due to his negligence.
*   Cullen potentially liable for negligent supervision of her employee.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity stems from the conflicting accounts of the accident. The case hinges on the credibility of witnesses, particularly Aldemita (Cullen's witness) and Nardo.
*   The "clean hands" doctrine argument against Cullen could be contentious.
*   There is no mention of insurance coverage, potentially affecting the collectability of any judgment.
*   The court does not address any potential liability of Nardo to Cang under their lease agreement, only addressing liability to Cullen.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code (Articles 2176, 2179, 2180, 2185):** The cornerstone of the negligence claims and employer liability.
*   **RA 4136 (Section 30):** Establishes the violation of traffic regulations by Saycon.
*   Numerous citations regarding witness credibility and the weight given to trial court findings.
*   Case law regarding the diligence required of employers in selecting and supervising employees (citations 52, 53).
*   Case Law: Estacion v. Bernardo, G.R. No. 144723, February 27, 2006, 483 SCRA 222, 231, citing Yambao v. ZuÂçòiga, 418 SCRA 266, 271 (2003).

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA based on the RTC's superior assessment of witness credibility and the finding that Saycon's negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. The Court further found Cullen negligent in the supervision of her employee.
