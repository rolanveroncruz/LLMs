**Legal Document Summary: *Aluad v. Aluad*, G.R. No. 176943 (2008)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision regarding a dispute over land ownership stemming from a purported *inter vivos* donation.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Disputed Donation:** Matilde Aluad executed a "Deed of Donation of Real Property Inter Vivos" in 1981 in favor of Maria Aluad (petitioners' mother), covering six lots. The deed stipulated the transfer would be effective upon the donor's death but allowed the donor to use, encumber, or dispose of the properties during her lifetime. The donation would also be rescinded if the donee pre-deceased the donor.
*   **Subsequent Disposition:** Matilde later sold one lot (Lot 676) to the respondent, Zenaido Aluad, in 1991 and devised another (Lot 674) to him in her 1992 will.
*   **Legal Challenge:** After Matilde's death, petitioners (Maria's heirs) sued Zenaido, claiming ownership of Lots 674 and 676 based on the 1981 Deed of Donation.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, classifying the Deed of Donation as a *donation mortis causa*, not *inter vivos*.  As such, it had to comply with the formalities of a will, which it did not. The donation was therefore void.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Danilo Aluad et al.):** Had to return possession of Lot 676 to the Respondent. They were also ordered to pay attorney's fees and litigation expenses.
*   **Respondent (Zenaido Aluad):** Retained ownership of Lot 676 (acquired via Deed of Absolute Sale). His ownership of Lot 674 (devised via will) was contingent on the probate of Matilde's will.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Probate of Will:**  The respondent's ownership of Lot 674 is contingent on the successful probate of Matilde's will. Failure to properly probate the will could jeopardize his claim to the property.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription (Dismissed):** Petitioners' attempt to claim Lot 674 via acquisitive prescription was dismissed since the claim was not raised at the lower court.
*   **Ambiguous Language in Deed of Donation:**  The phrase "or anyone of them who should survive" caused some confusion, but was ruled as to be in reference to Matilde only.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Distinction Between *Donation Inter Vivos* and *Mortis Causa*:** The Court relies on established jurisprudence, including *Maglasang v. Heirs of Corazon Cabatingan*, 432 Phil. 548 (2002) and *Reyes v. Mosqueda*, G.R. No. 45262, July 23, 1990, 187 SCRA 661 to distinguish between the two types of donations based on factors like the effective date of transfer, revocability, and survival of the donee.
*   **Formal Requirements of a Will (Article 805, Civil Code):**  Critical failure to comply with the 3-witness requirement and attestation clause invalidates the *donation mortis causa*. Also references Art. 806 concerning acknowledgement of the will.
*   **Property Rights:** Art. 428 of the Civil Code regarding the right to enjoy and dispose of property.
*   **Probate Requirement (Rule 75, Section 1, Rules of Court):** No will shall pass either real or personal estate unless it is proved and allowed.
*   **Acquisitive Prescription (General Rule):** Points of law, theories, and issues not brought to the attention of the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Characterization of the Deed of Donation:**  The central point of contention was whether the Deed of Donation was *inter vivos* or *mortis causa*.
*   **Petitioners' change in legal theory:** Petitioners initially claimed ownership based on inheritance, then amended their complaint to cite the deed of donation. Respondent contested this, arguing that the deed of donation was concocted by the petitioners to support their claim of ownership.

**Legal Advice:**

*   Respondent should immediately initiate probate proceedings for Matilde Aluad's will to solidify his claim to Lot 674.
*   Carefully examine the chain of title for both properties.
*   Address potential claims of prescription of action.
