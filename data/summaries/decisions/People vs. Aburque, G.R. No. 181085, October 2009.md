## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Aburque*, G.R. No. 181085

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Nemesio Aburque*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Second Division)

**Date:** October 23, 2009

**Holding:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Nemesio Aburque for **murder** under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Accusation:** Aburque was charged with murder for the stabbing death of Miguel Ablay, with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation. Dwelling was alleged as an aggravating circumstance.
*   **Defense:** Aburque admitted the killing but claimed **self-defense**, leading to a reverse trial.
*   **Elements of Self-Defense (Art. 11, RPC):** Unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity of the means employed, and lack of sufficient provocation. The court emphasized that *unlawful aggression* is the most crucial element.
*   **Treachery:** The Court found the qualifying circumstance of treachery present, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, depriving the victim of any real chance to defend himself.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant (Aburque):** Convicted of murder and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Ordered to indemnify the heirs of Miguel Ablay PHP 50,000.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The Court reiterated that when an accused admits killing the victim but pleads self-defense, the burden is on the accused to prove self-defense by clear and convincing evidence. (*People v. Aguilar*, G.R. Nos. 120622-23).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Prove Self-Defense:** Aburque's self-defense claim failed due to inconsistencies in his testimony and lack of corroboration.
*   **Credibility Issues:** The Court gave greater weight to the prosecution witnesses' testimonies, finding no improper motive. Appellate courts generally defer to trial court findings on witness credibility (*People v. Dorado*, G.R. No. 122248), though exceptions exist.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 248:** Murder.
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 11, par. 1:** Justifying circumstance of self-defense.
*   **People v. Aguilar, G.R. Nos. 120622-23:** Reiterated the burden of proof for self-defense lies with the accused.
*   **People v. Dorado, G.R. No. 122248:** Affirmed the general rule that appellate courts defer to trial court findings on witness credibility.
*   **People v. Mara, G. R. No. 184050:** Defined and applied the concept of treachery.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Voluntary Surrender vs. Arrest:**  The police blotter indicated a voluntary surrender, while the officer's testimony suggested an arrest. This inconsistency, although noted, did not affect the outcome of the case.
*   **Inconsistencies in Aburque's Testimony:** The discrepancies in Aburque's account of the events leading to the stabbing undermined his credibility and his claim of unlawful aggression, proving fatal to his defense.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for murder due to the failure of Aburque to convincingly prove self-defense. The presence of treachery as a qualifying circumstance was crucial. The inconsistencies in the Appellant's testimony were paramount in the Court's decision to reject his plea of self-defense. This case highlights the importance of a defendant's credibility and the high burden of proof when invoking self-defense.
