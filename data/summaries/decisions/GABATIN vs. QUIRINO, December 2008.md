**Summary of A.M. No. CA-08-23-P (Gabatin vs. Quirino)**

**Nature:** Administrative case against Marilou M. Quirino, a Court Stenographer IV, for conduct unbecoming a court employee.

**Key Facts:**

*   Janette Gabatin (Complainant) paid Quirino (Respondent) P50,000.00 to secure a PUV franchise.
*   Quirino failed to secure the franchise.
*   Quirino failed to return the money despite demands.
*   Transactions occurred during office hours.
*   Quirino initially worked at RTC Mandaluyong but later transferred to the CA without informing Gabatin.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Quirino's Obligation:** Supposedly to secure a PUV franchise for Gabatin. Failure led to an obligation to return P50,000.
*   **Violation of Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Specifically, Canon IV, Section 1: Duty to perform official duties with diligence and commit exclusively to office responsibilities during working hours.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found liable for **Simple Misconduct** under Section 56 B (2) of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Civil Service Commission Circular No. 19, s. 1999).
    *   **Penalty:** Suspension for Two (2) Months Without Pay.
*   **Potential Civil/Criminal Liability:** The decision notes the possibility of Gabatin pursuing civil/criminal actions to recover the money.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Mitigating Factors:** Respondent is a first-time offender and admitted receipt of the money. However, the court emphasized her position as a judiciary employee conducting private transactions during office hours, weighing against a minimum penalty.
*   **Ambiguity in Initial Agreement:** There might be an argument regarding the exact terms of the agreement (guaranteed franchise vs. assistance in applying), although the acknowledgment receipts weigh against Quirino.
*   **Limited Evidence:** The case was submitted based on pleadings; a more comprehensive investigation might have revealed more details.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Canon IV, Section 1 (Duty to perform official duties properly and with diligence).
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Civil Service Commission Circular No. 19, s. 1999):** Section 56 B (2) (Simple Misconduct).
*   **Republic Act No. 6713:** Section 4 (a) (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees, uphold public interest).
*   **Zenaida C. Gutierrez, et al. v. Rodolfo Quitalig:** (Uprightness expected of judiciary employees).
*   **Luz C. Adajar v. Teresita O. Develos, et al.:** (Practice abhorred).

**Legal Analysis & Considerations:**

The court's decision rested primarily on the violation of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel. Quirino's activities during office hours, coupled with the failure to deliver the franchise or return the money, constituted misconduct. The decision emphasizes the high standard of conduct expected of court employees, especially those dealing with the public. The potential civil/criminal liability remains a significant consideration for Gabatin. The imposition of suspension falls within the prescribed range for simple misconduct.
