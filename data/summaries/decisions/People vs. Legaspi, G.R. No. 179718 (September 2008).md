**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Lourdes V. Legaspi*, G.R. No. 179718 (2008)

**Summary:**

This case involves the conviction of Lourdes V. Legaspi for violations of Sections 8 and 16 of R.A. No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as amended, for possession of marijuana (Criminal Case No. 749-M-01) and methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) (Criminal Case No. 750-M-01). The conviction stemmed from a search of Legaspi's house conducted pursuant to a search warrant.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 8, Article II of R.A. No. 6425:**  Prohibits possession or use of prohibited drugs (marijuana). Penalty: Reclusion Perpetua to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos, contingent on the quantity involved, with amounts over 750 grams meriting the maximum penalty.
*   **Section 16, Article III of R.A. No. 6425:** Prohibits possession or use of regulated drugs (shabu) without a license or prescription. Penalty: Reclusion Perpetua to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos contingent on the quantity involved, with amounts over 200 grams meriting the maximum penalty. The sentence in this case was lower due to quantity.
*   **Section 9, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Permits nighttime search if affidavit asserts the property is in the place to be searched.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:**  To abide by the law and refrain from possessing prohibited or regulated drugs without legal authority.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Legaspi:**  Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for possessing 900 grams of marijuana and 8.663 grams of shabu.
    *   **Criminal Case No. 749-M-01 (Marijuana):** Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua* and a fine of P500,000.00.
    *   **Criminal Case No. 750-M-01 (Shabu):** Sentenced to imprisonment ranging from six (6) months of *arresto mayor*, as minimum, to four (4) years and two (2) months of *prision correccional*, as maximum.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Validity of the Search Warrant Execution:**  Appellant argued the search was conducted at an unreasonable time (early morning) and not in her presence.  The Court upheld the validity based on the express directive in the search warrant authorizing search at any time and the factual finding that the search was conducted in her presence with barangay officials as witnesses. The court deferred to lower court findings of fact.
*   **Chain of Custody:** While not explicitly raised in this decision, any challenge to the chain of custody of the seized drugs could potentially impact the admissibility of the evidence.
*   **Application of Penalties:** The Dangerous Drug Act has been subsequently amended by RA 9165, which would impose different penalties and quantity thresholds. The case was decided under RA 6425.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' findings regarding the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, deferring to the trial court's assessment based on observation of demeanor.

**Case Law Considerations:**

*   The Court referenced *People v. Che Chun Ting* and *People v. Romero* regarding deference to trial court findings on witness credibility. *Mendoza v. People* cited regarding lack of improper motive by enforcers.
*   The court cited *Rigor v. The Superintendent, New Bilibid Prison* on sentencing.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), Sections 8 and 16, as amended by R.A. No. 7659.
*   Revised Rules of Court, Rule 126, Section 9.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent based on the provided text. The contentious issues involved the factual circumstances of the search, which were resolved based on the lower courts' findings and deference to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
