## Legal Document Summary: SSC vs. Far S. Alba

**Case:** *Social Security Commission and Apolonio Lamboso vs. Far S. Alba*

**Citation:** 581 Phil. 446 (G.R. No. 165482, July 23, 2008)

**Issue:** Whether Far S. Alba was an "employer" of Apolonio Lamboso under the Social Security Act of 1954 (RA 1161) and liable for unremitted SSS contributions, and whether such claim should have been filed against the estate of Arturo Alba Sr., the original owner of the hacienda.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, holding Far S. Alba liable as an employer and reinstating the Social Security Commission's (SSC) Resolution. The claim was not a money claim requiring presentation in estate proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 1161 (Social Security Act of 1954):** Defines "employer" (Sec. 8(c)) and mandates remittance of contributions.
*   **SSC Resolution:** Ordered Far Alba to pay delinquent contributions, penalties, and damages under Section 24(b) of RA 1161 for Lamboso's employment from 1960 to 1973.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** Court applied the control test to determine Alba's status as an employer, emphasizing his selection and engagement of Lamboso, payment of wages, and power of control.
*   **Section 22 (b) of R.A. No. 8282 (the Social Security Act of 1997):** The Commission asserted that a petition for payment of SS contributions and SS retirement benefit may not be filed before the estate proceedings of the deceased employer as a claim of this nature is not a money claim arising from contract but a claim for taxes which may be enforced against the decedent's executor, administrator or legal heirs within the prescriptive period of twenty (20) years.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Far S. Alba:** Liable for delinquent contributions, penalties (3% per month), and damages as per the SSC Resolution.
*   **Far S. Alba:** Liable for unremitted contributions from 1960 to 1970, contrary to the CA decision.
*   **Ramon S. Benedicto**: originally held liable by the SSC, not at issue in the appeal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Magnitude of Liability:** Penalties and damages significantly increased the total amount owed by Alba, potentially exceeding the original contribution amount.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 1161 (1951), Sec. 8 (c).** Definition of employer.
*   **Article 212 (e) of the Labor Code**: Was cited to note the definitve phrase "directly or indirectly in the interest of the employer" which the CA used in determining whether or not Far Alba was an employer.
*   **Social Security System v. Court of Appeals, 401 Phil. 132, 141 (2000).** Cited as the Supreme Court is able to determine the facts of the case for itself if there is a conflict.
*   **Vera, et al. v. Judge Fernandez,[31] 178 Phil. 154 (1979).** Cited in support of the government claims not being covered by the statute of non-claims.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points:**

*   **Definition of "Employer":** The central point of contention was whether Alba, as administrator and son of the owner, qualified as an "employer" under RA 1161. The Court focused on his control and management of the hacienda.
*   **Estate Claim:** The Court of Appeals reasoned that the claim should have been filed against the estate of the original owner, Arturo Alba Sr. The Supreme Court disagreed, considering this type of claim as akin to tax obligations.
*   **Prescription:** There was a minor issue as to whether the claim had prescribed.
