## Legal Document Summary: *Allan Dizon y Aqui v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 170342)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the Petitioner for one count of simple rape.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner was charged with three counts of rape under three separate Informations, consolidated during trial. He was convicted for the rape occurring on February 20, 1997 (Criminal Case No. 304-97)
*   **Victim:** AAA, a 17-year-old illiterate at the time of the incident, was the complainant. Her testimony was central to the conviction.
*   **Key Evidence:** Prosecution relied primarily on the victim's testimony, corroborated by her mother and a social worker, as well as a medical certificate confirming her pregnancy. Victim stated "Ginalaw po niya ako" which was ruled to mean penetration of the vagina, based on clarifications in her testimony.
*   **Defense:** Petitioner denied the charges and presented an alibi (celebrating his birthday), which the court found weak as he was present at the crime scene. He also claimed an ill motive by the victim's family.
*   **Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the RTC's conviction. The Court emphasized the importance of the victim's credibility and the trial court's opportunity to observe her demeanor. The court found the victimâ€™s testimony was deemed credible, convincing, and consistent.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Damages:** P50,000 as civil indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages to the victim. No exemplary damages were awarded.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioner is obligated to serve the sentence of reclusion perpetua.
*   Petitioner is obligated to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner is criminally liable for rape under Republic Act No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law, Section 11)

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Ginalaw po niya ako" Interpretation:** The interpretation of the vernacular phrase "ginalaw po niya ako" was a key point of contention. The Court had to look at the entirety of the victim's testimony to clarify that she meant penetration.
*   **Defense Weakness:** The denial and alibi presented by the petitioner were weak and easily refuted by the prosecution's evidence.
*   **Retroactive Application of Rules:** The Court retroactively applied the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding the pleading of qualifying and aggravating circumstances. This application, while permissible for procedural rules, can be a point of contention.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:**  The information alleged that AAA was a minor (17 years old) during the incident. Nevertheless, there was no allegation that petitioner was her parent, ascendant or relative. Further, there was no allegation that he raped her with the use of a deadly weapon. Hence, the penalty imposable on petitioner is reclusion perpetua.

**Conclusion:**

The Court upheld the conviction based primarily on the victim's credible testimony, which was corroborated by other witnesses and circumstantial evidence. The weaknesses in the defense's arguments were also a factor. The interpretation of the vernacular phrase and the retroactive application of procedural rules could be areas of further legal scrutiny, although the Court's reasoning appears sound. The lack of pleading of aggravating circumstances prevented the imposition of a higher penalty and exemplary damages.
