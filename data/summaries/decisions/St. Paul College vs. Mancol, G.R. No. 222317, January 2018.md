**Legal Document Summary: *St. Paul College, Pasig vs. Mancol & Valera***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 questioning the CA's finding of constructive dismissal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The main issue revolves around whether Anna Liza Mancol and Jennifer Cecile Valera were constructively dismissed from their employment as pre-school teachers at St. Paul College, Pasig (SPCP). The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal's decision that the two teachers were indeed constructively dismissed.
*   **Reinstatement (Now Separation Pay):** The Labor Arbiter initially ordered reinstatement and payment of monetary awards. The CA reversed NLRC's decision and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision with some modifications. The CA's decision ordered for separation pay, which is computed based on the respondents' years of service.
*   **Monetary Awards:** Initially, the Labor Arbiter awarded backwages, overtime pay, holiday pay, 13th month pay, service incentive leave pay. The Court of Appeals deleted the award of overtime pay, holiday pay, holiday premium, rest day premium and nightshift differential overload pay. Further, the CA ordered for payment of moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The CA held St. Paul College, Pasig, and Sister Teresita Baricaua solidarily liable.
*   **Abandonment:** St. Paul College, Pasig claims that Anna Liza Mancol and Jennifer Cecile Valera abandoned their posts.

**Obligations:**

*   **SPCP:** Obligated to pay Anna Liza Mancol and Jennifer Cecile Valera separation pay (in lieu of reinstatement), backwages, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees and accrued wages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **SPCP and Sister Teresita Baricaua:** Found solidarily liable for the monetary awards due to constructive dismissal. This creates a significant financial burden, as both the institution and the individual are responsible.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Financial Exposure:** The primary risk is the substantial financial burden of backwages, separation pay, moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and accrued wages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Constructive Dismissal Definition:** Referencing *Tan v. National Labor Relations Commission* and *Manalo v. Ateneo de Naga University*, the court defines constructive dismissal as conditions rendering continued employment impossible, unreasonable, or unlikely.
*   **Abandonment Requirements:** Referencing *Ang v. San Joaquin, Jr.*, the court emphasizes the employer's burden to prove both the employee's failure to report for work without valid reason *and* their categorical intent to discontinue employment.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The exact calculation of separation pay** as of the finality of the decision could be a point of contention, requiring careful recomputation by the Labor Arbiter.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals ruling that the teachers were constructively dismissed. The burden of proof for abandonment was not met by the petitioners. The Court heavily relied on the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the CA, which found actions by SPCP and Sister Baricaua rendered continued employment impossible for the teachers.
