**Legal Document Summary: *Legaspi v. SSS*, G.R. No. 160653**

**Core Issue:** Propriety of venue in a collection suit for price adjustment arising from a construction agreement, specifically whether the venue selection clause in the contract is exclusive.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Construction Agreement:** J.D. Legaspi Construction (Contractor) contracted with SSS (Client) for construction of a building in Baguio City.
*   **Contract Price:** Fixed at P88,348,533.74.
*   **"No Escalation" Clause (Article III):** Explicitly prohibits price escalation.
*   **Judicial Remedies Clause (Article XIV):** Specifies that actions arising from the Agreement "may be brought...before the proper courts in Quezon City...the CONTRACTOR hereby expressly waiving any other venue."
*   **Contractor's Claim:** Contractor argues for price adjustment due to the devaluation of the Philippine Peso during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, citing increased costs of imported materials. Alleges basis for claim is Article 1267 of the Civil Code (difficult service beyond contemplation).
*   **SSS's Stance:** SSS argues the "no escalation" clause bars price adjustments and the contract's venue clause mandates actions be brought in Quezon City.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Contractor's Liability:** Bound by "no escalation" clause unless Article 1267 applies. Risk of bearing increased costs if price adjustment is denied. Potential liability for breach of contract if project was abandoned.
*   **SSS's Liability:** Potential liability for price adjustment if the court deems the circumstances fall under Article 1267 and the "no escalation" clause is unenforceable due to unforeseen circumstances.
*   **Venue:**  The Court determined the Contractor improperly filed the suit in Makati, as the Judicial Remedies Clause mandated Quezon City. The phrase "expressly waiving any other venue" was deemed to establish an exclusive venue.
*   **Cause of Action:** SSS initially challenged the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, but the SC upheld CA's holding that the Contractor's complaint adequately alleged facts to form a cause of action for price adjustment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1267 of the Civil Code:** Basis for Contractor's claim of extraordinary difficulty in performance.
*   **Section 2, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court:** General venue rules for personal actions (plaintiff's residence or defendant's residence).
*   **Section 4, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court:** Allows parties to agree in writing on an exclusive venue.
*   **Unimasters Conglomeration, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 335 Phil. 415, 424 (1997):** Interpretation of venue stipulations.
*   **Auction in Malinta, Inc. v. Luyaben , G.R. No. 173979, February 12, 2007, 515 SCRA 569, 572-573:** Strict interpretation of exclusive venue stipulations.
*   **Philippine Bank of Communications v. Trazo, G.R. No. 165500, August 30, 2006, 500 SCRA 242, 256:**  Standards for determining cause of action in a motion to dismiss.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"No Escalation" Clause (Article III) vs. Article 1267:**  Conflict between the express contractual terms and the potential for relief under unforeseen circumstances dictated by statute. Whether the Asian Financial Crisis qualifies as an unforeseen event under Article 1267 is contentious.
*   **Causation and Venue Selection:** The Contractor argued the suit was not "arising from" the agreement, but was a collection suit based on separate facts. This was rejected by the Court.

**Outcome and Significance:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals decision, ordering the dismissal of the Civil Case No. 00-1354 without prejudice to refiling the complaint in the proper court (Quezon City). This case reinforces the importance of clear and unambiguous language in venue selection clauses and demonstrates that an action for price adjustment under Article 1267 of the Civil Code stemming from a construction agreement containing an exclusive venue clause will likely be subject to that clause. This also underscores the limited situations where price increases would be considered an exception due to unforseen circumstances.
