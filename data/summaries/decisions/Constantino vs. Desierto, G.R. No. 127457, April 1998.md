## Legal Document Summary: *Constantino v. Desierto*

**Case:** *Mayor Felipe K. Constantino v. Hon. Ombudsman Aniano Desierto, et al.* G.R. No. 127457, April 13, 1998 (351 Phil. 896)

**Nature:** Special civil action for certiorari challenging the Ombudsman's resolution finding Mayor Constantino guilty of grave misconduct, prejudicial to the best interest of the service, and/or gross neglect of duty, and dismissing him from service.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution No. 21:** Authorized Mayor Constantino to enter into a "negotiated contract" for the "lease/purchase" of heavy equipment. Lacked specific parameters (rental rate, lease period, purchase price).
*   **Contract with Norlovanian Corporation:** Mayor entered into a lease agreement and a separate "Undertaking" for eventual transfer of ownership. The lease agreement was on a standard printed form with no details on term or amount of rent.
*   **SB Resolution No. 38:** Requested the Mayor to operate the "newly acquired heavy equipment leased/purchased from Norlovanian Corporation." This implies SB knowledge and acceptance of the deal.
*   **SB Resolution No. 47:** Stopped unauthorized payments related to the "illegally acquired pool of heavy equipment," citing budget discrepancies and equipment issues. This was initiated after operation of the equipment started.
*   **Ombudsman Charges:** Based on a complaint alleging violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), grave misconduct, conduct prejudicial to the interest of the service, and gross neglect of duty. Specifically, unauthorized lease agreement causing undue injury to the municipality.
*   **Mayor's Defense:** Acted in accordance with SB Resolutions No. 21 and 38. Alleges a "lease/purchase" agreement, SB knowledge, and that the deal was not outside the scope of the resolution, in addition to political motivation by some members of the sangguniang bayan..

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **reversed** the Ombudsman's resolution and **exonerated** Mayor Constantino.

**Key Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Resolution No. 21 Authority:** The Court held that the Mayor acted within the authority granted by Resolution No. 21. The resolution lacked specificity, granting the mayor some discretion.
*   **SB Knowledge and Approval:** SB Resolution No. 38 indicated knowledge and approval of the lease/purchase agreement, especially given Councilors did not object to the resolution nor the initial inspection of the heavy equipment.
*   **Inaccurate Complaint:** The Court criticized the inaccurate representations made in the councilor's complaint regarding the Resolutions that motivated the mayor.
*   **Integrity and Congruity of Documents:** The Court found the resolutions, contract, and delivery certificate to be consistent, not demonstrating any wrongdoing by the Mayor. The two documents, even if embodied in two writings, should be read to eliminate inconsistencies.
*   **Due Process:** the investigator did actually review the challenge order, which was confirmed by the Office of the Ombudsman.

**Potential Risks and Issues:**

*   **Ambiguity of "Lease/Purchase":** The SB resolution and the transaction were ambiguous regarding whether a lease or a purchase was intended. The court interpreted the "lease/purchase" agreement in a way that ultimately sided with the Mayor.
*   **Lack of Specificity in SB Resolution:** The vague terms of Resolution No. 21 created a situation where the Mayor had significant discretion, opening the door to potential abuse.
*   **Political Motivation:** The Court recognized the possibility of a politically motivated attack on the Mayor.
*   **Procedural Irregularities:** The Court noted the flaws in the complaint filed by the dissenting councilors, specifically factual inaccuracies and failure to acknowledge prior resolutions.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, specifically Section 3(e) and (g).
*   **R.A. No. 6770:** The Ombudsman Act of 1989, specifically Section 28 (investigation procedures) and Section 27 (appeal to Supreme Court).
*   **R.A. 7160:** Sec. 44 related to the succession of mayor's duties to the Vice-Mayor

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The term "lease/purchase" in Resolution No. 21 and related documents. The lack of a clear delineation between a lease and a purchase created ambiguity.
*   Resolution No. 21 not setting parameters as to rate of rental, period of lease, purchase price.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the Ombudsman's decision, finding that Mayor Constantino acted within the scope of the ambiguous authority granted by the Sangguniang Bayan. The Court emphasized the SB's subsequent knowledge and tacit approval of the transaction, as well as the inaccuracies in the complaint against the Mayor.
