## Legal Document Summary: *Dimal vs. People*

This case, *Dimal vs. People*, G.R. No. 216922, involves a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of a petition for certiorari regarding the denial of an Omnibus Motion to quash a search warrant (SW No. 10-11) and declare seized items inadmissible as evidence. The SC partly granted the petition.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Validity of Search Warrant:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the validity of Search Warrant No. 10-11, finding that the issuing judge (Judge Ong) properly determined probable cause after a searching examination of the applicant (P/Insp. Malixi) and witnesses (Edison, Shaira Mae, and Villador). The SC deemed the description of the place to be searched (Felix Gumpal Compound) sufficiently particular.
*   **One Specific Offense Rule:**  The SC rejected the argument that the SW was invalid for being issued in connection with two offenses (kidnapping and murder). It clarified that where a person kidnapped is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention, there is only one special complex crime of kidnapping with murder under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 7659, referencing *People v. Larra√±aga* (466 Phil. 324).
*   **Particularity of Items to be Seized:** The SC ruled that the SW only particularly described two items with sufficient particularity: "blood-stained clothes of Gemma Eugenio consisting of faded pink long sleeves jacket and black t-shirt" and a "0.9mm caliber pistol." Only items that matched that description in the return could be admissible.
*   **Inadmissibility of Evidence:** The SC declared most items seized inadmissible because they were not specifically described in the SW, nor were they validly seized under the "plain view doctrine" (citing *People v. Salanguit*, 408 Phil. 817). The prosecution failed to show the plain view doctrine elements (prior justification, inadvertent discovery, immediately apparent incriminating nature) were met beyond the specific items described in the warrant.
*   **Plain View Doctrine Limitations:** The SC emphasized that the "plain view doctrine" cannot justify a general exploratory search (quoting *Salanguit*), extending a search past the original justification. Items recovered in plain view *after* executing the valid portions of the warrant cannot be admitted. The Court reiterated the immediately apparent test from *United Laboratories, Inc. v. Isip* (500 Phil. 342, 363) in their judgement.
*   **Custodia Legis & Return of Items:** The Court ordered the return of Alien Certificates of Registration and a BDO Passbook to the victim's heirs but ordered a live .22 caliber bullet to remain in *custodia legis* pending resolution of a future criminal case against one of the petitioners (relying on *Alih v. Castro*, 235 Phil. 270).
*   **Omnibus Motion Rule:** The Court reminded the petitioners of the relevance of the omnibus motion rule under Section 8 of Rule 15 and that the issue of particularity was considered waived.
*  **US Jurisprudence:** The Court's decision also noted the usage of US Jurisprudence to help guide their interpretation of the Search Warrant requirements.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Plain View Application:** The practical application of the "plain view doctrine" remains fact-specific, creating potential for future litigation on whether an item's incriminating nature was "immediately apparent." The timing of the seizures and the officers' knowledge are crucial.
*   **Defining "Searching Questions":** While the SC deferred to the judge's finding of probable cause, the level of "searching questions" required remains somewhat subjective. This can lead to challenges to SWs based on inadequate judicial examination.
*   **Specificity of Description:** The ruling highlights the importance of precise descriptions in search warrants. Vague or general descriptions can result in the exclusion of evidence. This emphasizes careful drafting of warrant applications.
*   **Future Criminal Case:** The decision leaves open the possibility of a future criminal case against Dimal related to the seized ammunition. The outcome of this potential case is uncertain.
