**Case:** *Peregrina Mistica v. Republic of the Philippines* G.R. No. 165141, September 11, 2009.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision denying Peregrina Mistica's application for registration of title over a parcel of land. The SC ruled that Mistica failed to sufficiently prove open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation of the land since June 12, 1945, or earlier, as required under Section 14(1) of P.D. No. 1529 and Section 48(b) of Commonwealth Act 141, as amended by P.D. No. 1073.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Applicant for land registration has the burden to prove: (1) land is alienable and disposable; and (2) open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.  (Cited *Alfredo, Preciosa, Angelita & Crisostomo, all surnamed Buenaventura v. Amparo Pascual & Republic of the Phil.*, G.R. No. 168819, November 27, 2008).
*   **Possession and Occupation:**  Law requires both possession *and* occupation, emphasizing actual possession and manifestation of acts of dominion (Cited *Ong v. Republic*, G.R. No. 175746, March 12, 2008).
*   **Evidence Required:** Clear, positive, and convincing evidence is needed. Tax declarations are insufficient by themselves but can infer possession (Cited *Republic v. Carrasco*, G.R. No. 143491, December 6, 2006).

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to meet the evidentiary burden results in denial of the application for land registration.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Insufficient documentary evidence demonstrating long-term possession: Tax declarations covering only recent years (1997-1998) were deemed inadequate.
*   Inadmissible Evidence: Presentation of a Spanish document (alleged Deed of Sale from 1921) without translation rendered it useless as evidence.
*   Vague testimony: General statements about ownership and possession without factual details are insufficient. (Cited *The Dir., Lands Management Bureau v. Court of Appeals*, 381 Phil. 761, 770 (2000)).

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529, Section 14(1):** Defines who may apply for land registration.
*   **Commonwealth Act 141, Section 48(b) (as amended by P.D. No. 1073):** Similar provisions to P.D. No. 1529 regarding land registration requirements based on possession since June 12, 1945.
*   ***Republic v. Carrasco*, G.R. No. 143491, December 6, 2006:** Discusses the probative value of tax declarations.
*   ***Ong v. Republic*, G.R. No. 175746, March 12, 2008:** Clarifies the distinction between "possession" and "occupation" in land registration law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The requirement of "open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and occupation" is fact-specific and often leads to disputes over the sufficiency of evidence. The line between bare possession and "occupation" requiring acts of dominion is contentious.
*   The reliance on possession since June 12, 1945, often creates difficulties as older documentation might be unavailable or unreliable.
