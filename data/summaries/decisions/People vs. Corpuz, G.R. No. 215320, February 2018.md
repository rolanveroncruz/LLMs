**Case Summary: *People v. Corpuz*, G.R. No. 215320 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Manuel Corpuz for two counts of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **RPC Article 248 (Murder):** Corpuz was convicted of murder for the hacking deaths of Romana Arcular and Leonila Histo.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Eyewitness Leonilo Bongalan testified he saw Corpuz hacking the victims. Pedro Dejaresco and Teodoro Queri-queri corroborated by placing Corpuz near the scene holding a bolo shortly after the incident. Dr. Gacis's postmortem examinations confirmed fatal hack wounds consistent with a bolo or *sundang*.
*   **Defense Evidence:** Corpuz presented an alibi, claiming he was plowing a field in a different barangay at the time. His wife corroborated this.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Corpuz guilty based on Leonilo's testimony and the presence of abuse of superior strength.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction, finding the eyewitness credible and confirming abuse of superior strength. Modified the damages awarded.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction but modified the CA decision regarding treachery and the phrase "without eligibility for parole". Held that there was insufficient evidence of treachery and ruled that abuse of superior strength was present.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Conviction:** Guilty of two counts of murder.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count. Note: Court removes the clause denying eligibility for parole. Cites *People v. Sibbu*, G.R. No. 214757 (2017), regarding when "without eligibility for parole" is applicable.
*   **Damages:** Ordered to pay the heirs of each victim:
    *   ₱75,000.00 as civil indemnity (Cites *People v. Jugueta*, G.R. No. 202124 (2016)).
    *   ₱75,000.00 as moral damages (*People v. Jugueta*).
    *   ₱75,000.00 as exemplary damages (*People v. Jugueta*).
    *   ₱25,000.00 as temperate damages.
*   **Interest:** All monetary awards to earn interest at 6% per annum from finality until fully paid (Cites *People v. Combate*, 653 Phil. 487 (2010)).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony vs. Police Blotter:** The police blotter's initial report stated the suspect was "unknown," contradicting Leonilo's claim he witnessed the hacking. The court resolved this by stating that police blotters are not evidence of truth and cannot supersede positive testimony. The Court cited several cases including *People v. Gomez*, 357 Phil. 684 (1998); *People v. Ledesma*, 320 Phil. 215 (1995); *People v. Matildo*, 300 Phil. 681 (1994) and *People v. Malazarte*, 330 Phil. 193 (1996).
*   **Alibi:** Corpuz's alibi was weakened by his wife's testimony placing him only 200 meters from the crime scene.  The court cited *People v. Piosang*, 710 Phil. 519 (2013) regarding the requirement of physical impossibility.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** While abuse of superior strength was upheld, the Court reversed the CA's finding of treachery, citing a lack of evidence that Corpuz deliberately adopted a mode of attack to ensure the killing without risk to himself. The Court cited *People v. De Leon*, 428 Phil. 556 (2002), *People v. De Gracia*, 765 Phil. 386 (2015) and *People v. Camilet*, 226 Phil. 316 (1986).
*   **Application of *Reclusion Perpetua***: The Court clarified the correct application of the penalty of *reclusion perpetua*.

*   Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7659 (Amendment to Article 248 of RPC)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial discrepancy between the eyewitness testimony and the police blotter, though resolved by the court, could have been a point of contention.
