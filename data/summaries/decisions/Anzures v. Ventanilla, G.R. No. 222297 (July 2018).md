## Legal Document Summary - *Anzures v. Spouses Ventanilla* (G.R. No. 222297, July 9, 2018)

**Nature:**  Certiorari appeal of a CA decision affirming an RTC decision in an unlawful detainer action filed by Spouses Ventanilla (Respondents) against Fortunato Anzures (Petitioner).

**Key Issue:** Whether Respondents have a cause of action for unlawful detainer against Petitioner, and the validity of a Deed of Donation.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court (SC) **GRANTS** the petition, **REVERSES** the CA and RTC decisions, and **DISMISSES** the unlawful detainer complaint. The SC holds that the parties are co-owners of the subject property, and therefore Respondents cannot maintain an unlawful detainer action against Petitioner. The proper remedy is partition.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Unlawful Detainer:**  The SC held that although the original owner tolerated the occupancy, the co-ownership nature of this case overrides any potential unlawful detainer claim.
*   **Co-ownership:** SC determined that the documentary evidence establishes that Carolina Anzures and Erlinda Ventanilla are co-owners of the land and the house.  This finding is based on the Waiver of Rights and Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the original owners.
*   **Deed of Donation:** The SC addresses Petitioner's argument that the Deed of Donation (Carolina to Erlinda) was forged.  The SC affirms the CA's finding that the Petitioner failed to present sufficient evidence to prove forgery.
*   **"Pagpapamana sa Labas ng Hukuman" Document:** SC recognizes other documents, that the Petitioner also signed, demonstrating co-ownership between Carolina and Erlinda Ventanilla, therefore, estopping him from denying co-ownership based on the fact that he previously signed paperwork indicating co-ownership between his wife and the plaintiffs.
*   **Remedy:** Because the parties are co-owners, an unlawful detainer action is improper. The SC states that the appropriate remedy is an action for partition under Article 494 of the Civil Code.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The dismissal of the unlawful detainer action eliminates any immediate obligation for the Petitioner to vacate the property or pay rent.
*   Neither party can assert exclusive ownership or possession prior to partition.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Partition Suit:** The primary risk is the initiation of a partition suit by either party.  The partition could result in a physical division of the property (if feasible) or a sale of the property and division of the proceeds.
*   **Continued Dispute:** The co-ownership situation without a clear agreement could lead to continued conflict and potentially further litigation.
*   **Costly Litigation:** A partition action can be complex and expensive.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs appeals to the Supreme Court, generally limited to questions of law. *Pascual v. Burgos* (2016) outlines exceptions where factual findings can be reviewed.
*   **Article 494 of the New Civil Code:**  Establishes the right of a co-owner to demand partition.
*   **Unlawful Detainer:**  SC cites *Gov. Looyuko* (2013) regarding the nature of unlawful detainer actions.
*   *Nemo dat quod non habet, Mahilum v. Spouses Ilano* (2015) - Rule stating that "one cannot give what one does not have" applies.
*   *Quijano v. Atty. Amante* (2014) outlines the rights of co-owners of property.
* *Bejar v. Caluag*(2007) - The SC references the 4 remedies available to one who has been deprived of possession of real property.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the Deed of Donation was found to be not definitively forged, its implications on the precise ownership shares remain somewhat unclear without a formal partition or agreement.
*   The exact legal effect of the "Pagkakaloob ng Bahagi ng Lupa na may Kasunduan" (agreement regarding registering the land in Carolina's name while acknowledging co-ownership) needs careful consideration in a partition action.

**Recommendations:**

*   Advise client (Fortunato Anzures) regarding the potential for a partition suit and the implications thereof.
*   Explore the possibility of negotiating a settlement with the respondents to avoid protracted and costly litigation.
*   Review the relevant documentary evidence to determine the best strategy for a potential partition action.
