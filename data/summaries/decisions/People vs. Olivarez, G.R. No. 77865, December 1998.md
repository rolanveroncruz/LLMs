**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Rafael Olivarez, Jr. and Danilo Arellano* (G.R. No. 77865, December 4, 1998)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court reversed the conviction of Rafael Olivarez, Jr. and Danilo Arellano for robbery with double homicide, acquitting them due to inadmissibility of evidence. The case revolves around the death of Tiu Hu and Zie Sing Piu during a robbery.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Robbery with Double Homicide. The Court clarifies that "homicide" in Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code is generic, encompassing murder and other acts causing death. Multiplicity of victims is an aggravating circumstance, not a separate offense.
*   **Warrantless Arrest:** The Court held that the arrest of the appellants was illegal as it didn't fall under any exception to the warrant requirement under the Rules of Criminal Procedure (Rule 113, Section 5; formerly Section 6). *Rationale:* Appellants were arrested two days after the crime, were not committing any crime in flagrante delicto, nor were they escapees.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Evidence obtained due to the illegal arrest, including the stolen items recovered and pointed out by Arellano, were deemed inadmissible under Section 4(2), Article IV of the 1973 Constitution (exclusionary rule, fruit of the poisonous tree). This includes utilizing those illegally obtained evidence to sustain any civil liability.
*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** The extrajudicial confession of Rafael Olivares, Jr. was also deemed inadmissible because it was obtained during custodial investigation without counsel. The Court cited jurisprudence establishing that waivers of the right to counsel must be made in the presence or with the assistance of counsel, even under the 1973 Constitution.
*   **Right to Counsel (Custodial Investigation):** The Court emphasized the importance of providing counsel during custodial investigations to prevent coercion and ensure the suspect's rights are protected.
*   **Hearsay:** The extrajudicial confession of one accused cannot be used against a co-accused (res inter alios acta rule) unless repeated in open court or there is an opportunity for cross-examination.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Without the inadmissible confession and illegally obtained evidence, the remaining circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court reiterates that the prosecution must prove guilt, not rely on the weakness of the defense.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The Court stressed that the presumption of innocence prevails over the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main risk was the wrongful conviction based on improperly obtained evidence. The court addresses this squarely.
*   The reliance on circumstantial evidence hinged entirely on the admissibility of the confession and recovered items. Once these were excluded, the remaining circumstances were insufficient.

**Obligations:**

*   The State has a legal obligation to adhere to constitutional safeguards regarding arrest and custodial investigation.
*   The Public Attorney's Office (PAO) has a responsibility to diligently represent their clients, especially in capital cases.
