## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ramos y Viray*, G.R. No. 180508 (2009)

**Case Overview:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Antonio Ramos y Viray ("Appellant") of illegal sale and possession of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride (shabu) under Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Court found the buy-bust operation conducted by Makati City Police SAID-SOTF to be deficient in complying with the mandatory procedure outlined in Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165, compromising the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sections 5 & 11, Article II of R.A. 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. 9165:** Mandates specific procedures for the seizure and custody of dangerous drugs during buy-bust operations, including immediate inventory and photographing of the seized items in the presence of the accused and representatives from the media, DOJ, and barangay officials.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, Appellant was found liable by the RTC and CA for violating Sections 5 & 11, Article II of R.A. 9165, facing life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000 for illegal sale, and 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months imprisonment and a fine of PHP 300,000 for illegal possession. The Supreme Court overturned this.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The core issue is the failure of the buy-bust team to properly document the inventory and photograph the seized drugs immediately following the arrest, as required by Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165. The testimony of PO2 Aseboque revealed lack of knowledge regarding adherence to photography requirements and uncertainity regarding inventory report.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The central statute governing drug offenses. Specifically, the provisions on illegal sale (Sec. 5), illegal possession (Sec. 11), and chain of custody (Sec. 21).
*   **People v. Tan, 401 Phil. 259 (2000):** Highlights the dangers of abuse inherent in anti-narcotic operations and the need for judicial vigilance in drug cases.
*   **People v. Pringas, G.R. No. 175928 (2007):**  Acknowledges that non-compliance with Section 21 is not always fatal if there's justifiable ground and integrity is preserved. However, this ruling was distinguished as the prosecution failed to substantiate that an inventory was made.
*   **Malillin v. People, G.R. No. 172953 (2008):**  Reiterates that the Supreme Court may disturb lower courtsâ€™ factual findings if facts of weight and substance have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied.
*   **People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832 (2008):** Cites People v. Gireng, 311 Phil. 12 (1995) and People v. Pagaura, 334 Phil. 683 (1997). Highlights the dangers inherent in drug cases of an innocent being made to suffer severe penalties for drug offenses.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Court noted that the records did not clarify whether the pocket where the drugs were found was a shirt or pant pocket, which might raise concerns on the ease of planting evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted the Appellant based on the failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody as mandated by Section 21 of R.A. 9165. The absence of proper documentation (inventory and photographs) created reasonable doubt regarding the integrity and origins of the seized drugs, undermining the presumption of regularity in the police operation. This case highlights the strict requirements for handling drug evidence and the consequences of non-compliance.
