Here's a legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Renante B. Remoticado vs. Typical Construction Trading Corp. and Rommel M. Alignay*, G.R. No. 206529, April 23, 2018

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division (Leonen, J.)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC and Labor Arbiter's dismissal of an illegal dismissal complaint.

**Issue:** Whether Remoticado voluntarily resigned or was illegally dismissed.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision.  The Court found that Remoticado failed to prove he was terminated.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Burden of Proof in Illegal Dismissal:** The Court reiterates that in illegal dismissal cases, the *employer* bears the burden of proving just cause. However, this burden only arises *after* the *employee* has established *prima facie* evidence of termination by the employer.  *Doctor v. NII Enterprises* cited.
*   **Factual Issues:** The Court emphasizes that Rule 45 petitions are limited to questions of law, not fact. The consistent factual findings of the lower tribunals (voluntary resignation) are binding unless an exception applies (e.g., speculation, grave abuse of discretion, misapprehension of facts). The Court found no applicable exception. *Pascual v. Burgos* outlines exceptions to Rule 45.
*   **Quitclaim and Waiver:** Remoticado signed a "Kasulatan ng Pagbawi ng Karapatan at Kawalan ng Paghahabol" (waiver and quitclaim).  The Court acknowledges that waivers and quitclaims are frowned upon if coerced or unconscionable, but are valid if freely executed, with a full understanding and reasonable consideration.  Remoticado didn't disavow the waiver or allege coercion. *Goodrich Manufacturing Corporation v. Ativo* is cited for the requisites of a valid quitclaim.
*   **Lack of Evidence of Dismissal:** The Court found Remoticado's claim of being told to stop reporting for work (due to a canteen debt) unsubstantiated and improbable. He presented no supporting evidence.
*   **No nexus between the debt and termination:** Remoticado's debt was to a canteen not owned by or affiliated with Typical Construction, making it improbable the employer would use this as a ground for termination.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employee's Obligation:** To present substantial evidence of termination to shift the burden to the employer to prove just cause.
*   **Employer's Potential Liability:** If termination is proven and no just cause is established, the employer would be liable for illegal dismissal penalties (backwages, separation pay, etc.).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of Quitclaim:** Although upheld here, quitclaims are always subject to scrutiny. The lack of legal counsel for Remoticado during execution, while not explicitly addressed, is a potential issue. The relatively small amount paid (P5,082.53) *could* raise concerns about the "reasonableness" of the consideration, although the Court apparently didn't find it problematic here.
*   **Factual Findings:** The Court heavily relies on the factual findings of the lower courts. If there were stronger evidence contradicting the finding of voluntary resignation (e.g., witness testimony, documented inconsistencies), the outcome could have been different.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
*   *Doctor v. NII Enterprises*
*   *Pascual v. Burgos*
*   *Goodrich Manufacturing Corporation v. Ativo*

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   This case underscores the importance of *thoroughly documenting* all aspects of employee resignations, including obtaining a properly executed and witnessed quitclaim and waiver.
*   Employees alleging illegal dismissal must present concrete, convincing evidence to establish termination before the employer has to defend its actions.
*   Challenges to quitclaims require clear proof of coercion, fraud, or unconscionability.
