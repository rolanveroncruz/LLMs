## Legal Document Summary: *Melendres v. Catambay*

**Case:** *Narciso Melendres v. Alicia Catambay*, G.R. No. 198026, November 28, 2018.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision dismissing the complaint for annulment of a Deed of Absolute Sale with Reconveyance and Damages.

**Subject Matter:**  Dispute over a 1,622-square-meter property (Lot No. 3302, Cad-393, Tanay Cadastre).  Petitioner Melendres claims ownership via inheritance and long-standing possession. Respondents Benavidez (Sps. Benavidez) claim ownership through a Deed of Absolute Sale from respondent Catambay, whose title derives from a Free Patent (FP No. IV-1-001692) and OCT (OCT No. M-2177) issued to her predecessor-in-interest, Alejandro Catambay.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Melendres):** Claims continuous, open, adverse, and exclusive possession in the concept of owner for over 30 years, predating the issuance of the Free Patent to Alejandro Catambay. Burden to prove prior ownership and invalidity of the patent and subsequent titles.
*   **Respondents (Catambay & Benavidez):**  Assert ownership based on the Torrens title derived from the Free Patent granted to Alejandro Catambay.  Sps. Benavidez have the burden of proving they are innocent purchasers for value.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligated to cancel titles originating from OCT No. M-2177 if declared invalid.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Respondents (Catambay & Benavidez):**  Potential loss of ownership and possession of the subject property. Catambay potentially liable for damages arising from the invalid sale.  Sps. Benavidez could face claims related to their construction and operation of a gasoline station on the property.
*   **Petitioner (Melendres):** Still needs to perfect the imperfect title through proper proceedings in accordance with the Public Land Act

**Decision:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA and RTC decisions.  It declared the Deed of Absolute Sale between Catambay and Sps. Benavidez *null and void* and ordered the Register of Deeds to *cancel* all titles traced from OCT No. M-2177.

**Rationale:**

*   The Court found that the **Free Patent** issued to Alejandro Catambay was *invalid* because:
    *   The evidence showed that Melendres and his predecessors-in-interest had been in continuous, open, adverse, and exclusive possession of the property for over 30 years, predating the issuance of the Free Patent, thus making it private property.
    *   Alejandro Catambay and his heirs were never in actual possession of the property.
*   The Court held that **Sps. Benavidez were *not* innocent purchasers for value** because they had actual knowledge of Melendres' claim to the property *prior* to the sale. This defeats the defense of indefeasibility of a Torrens title.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141, Section 44 & 48):** Governs the issuance of Free Patents and requirements for confirmation of title.  The Court heavily relies on Section 48, arguing that, due to the length and nature of Melendres' occupancy, the petitioner has essentially been in continuous compliance of government land grants under the parameters stated within.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Sec. 32:** Incontestability of Torrens Title after a year.  However, as the land was already deemed private by the SC, the director of lands had no jurisdiction to grant a free patent.
*   ***Agne v. Director of Lands, 261 Phil. 13 (1990)***: The Supreme Court invalidated free patents and certificates of title because the land in question had already been withdrawn from the public domain prior to the subsequent award of the patent.
*   ***Heirs of Santiago v. Heirs of Santiago, 452 Phil. 238 (2003)***: This case establishes the principle that a free patent issued over private land is null and void, producing no legal effect.  The Court here relied heavily on this precedence.
*   ***Benavidez v. CA, 372 Phil. 615 (1999)***: Previously ruled in favor of Melendres regarding a forcible entry action by Benavidez on the same property. That finding was held by this current Supreme Court as having "persuasive effect".

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Determination of "actual possession":** This was a key point. The Court relied on evidence showing Melendres' cultivation and use of the land, as opposed to Catambay's lack of use.
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value Status:** The Court found against Sps. Benavidez due to their pre-existing knowledge of the dispute, undermining their claim of good faith.
*   **Reversion Action:** The CA incorrectly relied on this, believing only the State could bring an action. The Supreme Court clarified that this isn't a reversion case as the property is already private.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Long-standing, open, continuous, and adverse possession of public land *can* create a right of ownership *prior* to the issuance of a Free Patent to another party.
*   Purchasers with *actual knowledge* of a title defect cannot claim the protection of being an innocent purchaser for value.
*   Evidentiary burden shifts to defendants who are purchasers, proving they are innocent purchasers in good faith.
