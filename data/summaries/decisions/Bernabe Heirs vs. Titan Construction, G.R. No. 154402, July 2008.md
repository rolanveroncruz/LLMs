Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Heirs of Antonio F. Bernabe v. Court of Appeals and Titan Construction Corporation*, G.R. No. 154402, July 21, 2008 (581 Phil. 48)

**Nature of Case:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals decision affirming RTC decision for Specific Performance.

**Key Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Heirs of Antonio F. Bernabe (original defendant)
*   **Respondents:** Titan Construction Corporation (plaintiff/vendee)

**Facts:**

*   Titan sued Antonio F. Bernabe, et al. (co-owners of land) for specific performance based on an undated "Deed of Sale of Real Estate" where Bernabe et al. agreed to sell land to Titan for P17.7M.
*   The payment terms involved an initial down payment and a subsequent payment contingent on Titan obtaining a right of way and the vendors fulfilling certain conditions related to Eriberta Development Corporation.
*   Bernabe initially attempted to rescind the deed. Eventually a compromise agreement with 3 parties occurred; Antonio then died and his heirs opposed a subsequent supplemental complaint.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of Titan, ordering the heirs to execute a registerable deed upon payment of the remaining balance. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Agreements:**

*   **Deed of Sale of Real Estate (Original):**  An undated agreement for sale of land, arguably a perfected contract of sale. Contains clauses requiring Titan to procure a right-of-way. The court determined this to be superseded by a latter agreement.
*   **Deeds of Conditional Sale (Subsequent):** Resulting from the aforementioned compromise, the 3 parties including Antonio individually entered into Deeds of Conditional Sale with Titan, with similar terms and conditions but for differing purchase prices.  Identified by the Supreme Court as contracts "to sell." The Supreme Court identified key aspects of the agreement as "to sell" as full payment triggers execution of an absolute deed, not immediate transfer of ownership.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether Titan could compel execution of a registerable deed of sale based on partial payment under a "Deed of Conditional Sale."
2.  Whether the heirs could rescind the contract due to Titan's failure to pay the full consideration.

**Court's Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *denied* the petition. The operative agreement is the Deed of Conditional Sale which is a contract *to sell*.
*   **Extinctive Novation:** Held that the "Deed of Sale of Real Estate" was superseded (extinctive novation per Art. 1292 of the Civil Code) by the "Deeds of Conditional Sale," which were a result of the compromise agreement.
*   **Specific Performance:** Titan has a cause of action for specific performance because they have partially performed (down payments, segregation of the property).
*   **Rescission Denied:** Heirs' demand for rescission was denied.  The conditions precedent to Titan's obligation to pay the balance were *mostly* fulfilled, though were fulfilled during the trial, which the court uses as basis for specific performance.
*   **Reciprocal Obligations (Art. 1191 CC):**  The Court applied principles of reciprocal obligations, noting that rescission is available to the *injured* party. Titan was found ready and willing to perform.
*   **Titan Must Pay Balance:** Titan was ordered to pay the remaining P3,431,058.42 within 60 days of the decision becoming final, upon which the heirs must execute the deed of absolute sale.

**Obligations:**

*   **Titan:** To pay P3,431,058.42 within 60 days of the decision becoming final.
*   **Heirs:** To execute a deed of absolute sale upon Titan's payment.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Titan:** Risk of losing the right to the property if it fails to pay the balance within the prescribed timeframe.
*   **Heirs:** Possible contempt proceedings if they refuse to execute the deed after receiving payment.

**Relevant Law:**

*   **Civil Code (CC):** Articles 1191 (reciprocal obligations/rescission), 1292 (novation), 1356, 1357, and 1358 (form of contracts).
*   **Case Law:** Principles differentiating "contracts of sale" from "contracts to sell" (e.g., *Salazar v. Court of Appeals*).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The conditions in the Deed of Conditional Sale were contentious and not fully met at the time of filing suit, but their later fulfillment became the basis for the court's decision.
*   Validity and effect of the original "Deed of Sale of Real Estate" - whether it constituted a perfected sale was argued, but ultimately deemed superseded.

**Potential Issues for Litigation:**

*   Disputes over the *exact* calculation of the remaining balance.
*   Potential challenges to the validity of the Special Power of Attorney used by the children to act on Antonio's behalf (though seemingly not raised in the case).
*   Legal remedies if either party fails to comply with the Supreme Court's order.
