## Legal Document Summary - *Wilson A. Go v. Harry A. Go* (G.R. No. 183546, September 18, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari (treated as such despite initially filed as Certiorari) assailing a Court of Appeals decision that annulled RTC orders directing the deposit of rental income in an action for partition and accounting.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Wilson A. Go (Plaintiff in the RTC, seeking partition and accounting).
*   **Respondent:** Harry A. Go (Defendant in the RTC, co-owner per title).

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Claim:** Wilson A. Go filed suit for partition and accounting, alleging co-ownership with Harry A. Go of land with warehouses (TCT No. V-44555). He claims Harry A. Go is improperly collecting rent without sharing.
*   **Defense:** Harry A. Go argues the land was purchased by their father, Sio Tong Go, and title was placed in their names according to Chinese custom. He argues a conditional indivision was imposed by their father, the income supports the family, and the issue of *actual* ownership must be resolved first.  He counterclaims for damages.
*   **RTC Order:**  The RTC ordered Harry A. Go to deposit *all* rental income with the court, *sua sponte*, exceeding the scope of Wilson A. Go's motion requesting only his half.
*   **CA Decision:** The Court of Appeals annulled the RTC order, finding it premature before resolving the co-ownership issue.
*   **SC Decision:**  Partially grants the petition. Reverses the CA and RTC orders.  New order directs deposit of *1/12* of rental income, calculated as Wilson A. Go's preliminary presumptive share based on potential inheritance after his father's passing.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Harry A. Go:**  Obligated to deposit 1/12 of monthly rental income with the RTC pending final determination of ownership in the partition action.
*   **Both Parties:** Subject to the final determination of ownership and proportionate shares in the partition action in the RTC.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Co-Ownership Dispute:** Central issue revolves around the nature of ownership. Harry A. Go argues against true co-ownership, citing Sio Tong Go's alleged beneficial ownership and intention to maintain indivision for the family's benefit. This could be interpreted as an implied trust.  Article 1448 of the Civil Code is relevant to arguments regarding implied trusts and potential gifts.
*   **Indispensable Parties:** Harry A. Go raised the lack of jurisdiction due to the failure to implead all heirs of Sio Tong Go (including his wife) as indispensable parties. Rule 69, Section 1 of the Rules of Court governs partition actions and the requirement of including all interested parties. This remains unresolved in the Supreme Court decision but must be addressed in the RTC. This is a significant jurisdictional issue. *Albert v. CFI of Manila* is classic jurisprudence on indispensable parties.
*   **Ambiguous Claims:** Wilson A. Go's shifting legal theories (co-ownership based solely on title, then donation) weaken his position. His admission that his father controlled the property undermines his claim. The Supreme Court notes his lack of candor.
*   **Scope of Order:**  The RTC's original order to deposit the *entire* rental income was problematic as it exceeded the relief requested.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 69 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs actions for partition.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari - incorrectly initially filed.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari - proper remedy.
*   **Rule 135, Sections 5 & 6 of the Rules of Court:**  Inherent powers of courts.
*   **Article 1448 of the Civil Code:** Implied Trust; rebuttable presumption of gift.
*   ***Maglucot-aw v. Maglucot, 385 Phil. 720 (2000):*** Two-stage nature of partition cases: first, determine co-ownership; second, determine the partition's propriety.
*   ***Province of Bataan v. Hon. Villafuerte, Jr., 419 Phil. 907 (2001):***  Court's authority to issue preservatory orders like escrow.
*   ***Bustamante v. Court of Appeals, 430 Phil. 797 (2002):***  Order to deposit rentals pending the resolution of a possessory action.
*   ***Philippine Journalists, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 166421, September 5, 2006:*** Liberal interpretation of rules to treat a petition for certiorari as petition for review on certiorari
*   ***Valarao v. Court of Appeals, 363 Phil. 495, 510 (1999):*** Court of law and court of justice.

**Conclusion:**

The case involves complex issues of ownership arising from familial relationships and potential undocumented agreements. The critical next steps are to ensure all indispensable parties are joined in the RTC action and to thoroughly litigate the true nature of the ownership of the property, taking into account the customs, traditions, and financial contributions of the family. The 1/12 deposit order provides a temporary solution, but the ultimate outcome depends on the RTC's factual findings regarding the underlying ownership claims.
