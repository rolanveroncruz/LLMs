## Legal Document Summary: Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 222428)

**Case Summary:** Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. (CCBPI) petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse the CTA En Banc's decision denying its claim for refund or issuance of tax credit for alleged over/erroneous payment of VAT for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. CCBPI claimed it inadvertently failed to include P123,459,647.70 in input VAT in its VAT return. The CTA denied the claim, and the CTA En Banc affirmed, finding that Section 229 of the NIRC (National Internal Revenue Code) applies only to erroneous payment or illegal collection of taxes, which is not the case here. The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA ruling.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** CCBPI argued that the refund/tax credit claim stems from an inadvertent failure to apply undeclared input tax against output VAT, constituting erroneous payment correctible under Section 229 of the NIRC. They cite *Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. CIR* for the proposition that unreported but substantiated input taxes can be credited.
*   **CTA & Supreme Court Rationale:** Both the CTA and the Supreme Court relied on *CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation* to hold that Section 229 does not apply to unutilized input VAT. The Court reasoned that input VAT is not "excessively collected" because the amount paid was initially correct. If the input tax is considered "excessively collected", then the VAT-registered seller should apply for the tax credit and not the buyer. The Supreme Court also held that the input taxes are not "excessively" collected and should not be considered for tax credit, as understood by Section 229 of the NIRC.
*   **Substantiation Issue:** The CTA found that even if the substantiated input taxes (P48,509,474.01) were declared, they wouldn't offset the output tax liabilities, leaving no balance for refund.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 110(B) NIRC:** Deals with excess output or input tax, allowing carry-over to succeeding quarters or refund/credit for zero-rated sales.
*   **Section 112 NIRC:**  Specifies conditions for refunds or tax credits of input tax, primarily focusing on zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sales and cancellation of VAT registration.
*   **Section 204(C) NIRC:** Commissioner's authority to refund or credit taxes erroneously or illegally received.
*   **Section 229 NIRC:** Recovery of tax erroneously or illegally collected; the main point of contention, deemed inapplicable to CCBPI's claim as it relates to the VAT System under Sec. 110 and 112.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***CIR v. San Roque Power Corporation (703 Phil. 300 (2013)):*** Established the doctrine that Section 229 NIRC is inapplicable to claims for recovery of unutilized input VAT. This case is central to the SC's decision.
*   ***Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. CIR (694 Phil. 7 (2012)):*** CCBPI cites this to support the argument that unreported input taxes can be credited against output tax if properly substantiated. The SC distinguished it by pointing to the fact that the input tax for this case does not offset the output tax.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Construction Against Taxpayer:** The Court emphasized the principle that tax refund claims are construed *strictissimi juris* against the taxpayer. This burdens CCBPI with a high standard of proof.
*   **Factual Findings of the CTA:** The Supreme Court gives high respect to the CTA's factual findings. CCBPI's attempt to re-litigate the factual issue of whether the input taxes would offset output tax was rejected.
*   **Applicability of Sec. 229:** The main risk lies in the interpretation and application of Sec. 229. *San Roque* firmly establishes its inapplicability to VAT refund claims not tied to erroneously or illegally *collected* taxes.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** CCBPI's argument regarding unjust enrichment was dismissed in light of the legal principles and CCBPI's failure to follow prescribed statutory procedures for filing an input VAT refund.

**Conclusion:**

This case reaffirms the strict interpretation of tax refund provisions and the limited scope of Section 229 NIRC in VAT refund claims. CCBPI's attempt to claim a refund for unutilized input VAT, not related to zero-rated sales or VAT registration cancellation, was unsuccessful. The decision highlights the importance of properly substantiating input taxes and complying with procedural requirements for VAT refunds.
