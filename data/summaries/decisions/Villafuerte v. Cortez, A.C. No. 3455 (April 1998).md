## Legal Document Summary: *Villafuerte vs. Cortez*, A.C. No. 3455

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against a lawyer for neglect of duty.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Complainant (Villafuerte) alleges neglect** by Respondent (Atty. Cortez) in handling two cases ("reconveyance" and ejectment), despite paying acceptance and retainer fees (P1,750.00).
*   **Respondent admits receiving payment** but argues non-representation was due to Complainant's failure to provide case records and secure withdrawal of prior counsel.
*   **IBP-CBD found Respondent negligent,** rejecting the excuse of non-receipt of records. IBP initially recommended 3-month suspension.
*   **IBP Board of Governors adopted the recommendation.**
*   **The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed negligence** but reduced the suspension to one month.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent (Atty. Cortez) breached his duty of diligence and competence** to his client (Villafuerte), violating Canons 17, 18 and 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The SC emphasized a lawyer's duty to exert best efforts to protect a client's interests within the bounds of law and to not neglect entrusted legal matters.
*   **Complainant (Villafuerte) has a reciprocal duty to cooperate with counsel** in handling the case.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of Retainer:** The document references that a potential point of contention was whether the payment covered one or both cases, but the court ruled the matter was immaterial because neither case was acted upon by the lawyer. This point could have been stronger if the engagement letter and the receipt for funds were available for review.
*   **Documentation:** The Court's reliance on the IBP-CBD findings highlights the importance of maintaining clear records of client communications, accepted retainers, and any limitations on the scope of representation. If documentation was more thorough, it could have assisted the court in deciding on the issue.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Canons 17, 18, and 18-04:** These canons form the basis for the finding of negligence.
*   **Implied Attorney-Client Relationship:** The Court's ruling suggests that accepting payment, even with reservations, can establish an attorney-client relationship and trigger attendant professional obligations.

**Contention:**

*   **Respondent attempted to disclaim the attorney-client relationship**. The Court rejected this argument.

**Conclusion:**

This case serves as a reminder of a lawyer's ethical obligations of competence and diligence. Even with claimed client non-cooperation, the lawyer must take reasonable steps to pursue the client's case or properly withdraw from representation. The SC's reduction of the suspension demonstrates the importance of client cooperation, but ultimately, the responsibility for diligent representation falls on the lawyer.
