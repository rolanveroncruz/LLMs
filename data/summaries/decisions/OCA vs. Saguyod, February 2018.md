**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. P-17-3705**

**Case Name:** *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Paulino I. Saguyod*

**Date:** February 6, 2018

**Court:** En Banc, Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Issue:**  Whether Branch Clerk of Court (BCC) Saguyod is administratively liable for notarizing documents without proper authorization and in violation of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court found BCC Saguyod GUILTY of inefficiency and incompetence in the performance of official duties and SUSPENDED him from service for one (1) year, with a stern warning against future similar violations.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Violation of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC (Re: 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice):** BCC Saguyod notarized documents submitted to the RTC without complying with Section (f) of the Resolution dated August 15, 2006 of this A.M.  Specifically, he failed to certify that no other notaries public were available in Paniqui, Tarlac.
*   **Section (f) of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC:** Authorizes RTC Clerks of Court to notarize documents (official and private) if notarial fees are for the Judiciary's account *and* they certify the unavailability of other notaries public in the RTC's territorial jurisdiction.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation:** As a Clerk of Court, BCC Saguyod had a duty to adhere strictly to the Rules on Notarial Practice, particularly A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC.
*   **Liability:**  His repeated failure to comply with A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC constitutes inefficiency and incompetence, a grave offense under Section 46 (B) (4) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service.
*   **Defense Rejected:** Saguyod's defenses of good faith, no monetary consideration, and lack of other notaries public were rejected. The Court highlighted the existence of other notarized documents from Paniqui notaries, and stressed that violation of the rule itself establishes liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** While not explicitly raised, the definition of "availability" of other notaries public might be a potential source of ambiguity in future cases.  The court did not define what constitutes "unavailability" in a way that clarifies whether mere inconvenience, cost, or refusal to notarize constitutes unavailability.
*   **Precedent Setting:** Reinforces the strict liability aspect of violating notarial rules for court personnel, emphasizing the responsibility and efficiency expected of public servants.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC (Re: 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice):** The central rule violated.
*   **Section 41, Chapter 10, Book I of the Administrative Code of 1987 (EO 292):** Cited by Saguyod in his defense, but ultimately deemed insufficient to excuse non-compliance with A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC.  This provision grants clerks of court general authority to administer oaths, but does not override the specific requirements of the Notarial Rules.
*   **Section 46 (B) (4) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (Resolution No. 1101502):** Used to determine the penalty.
*   **Sasing v. Gelbolingo, 704 Phil. 251 (2013):** Defines "inefficiency."

**Concise Summary for Lawyer:**

This case confirms administrative liability for an RTC Branch Clerk of Court who repeatedly notarized documents in violation of A.M. No. 02-8-13-SC. The Court held that failure to certify the absence of other notaries public and disregard for completeness of documents constituted inefficiency and incompetence, despite claimed good faith. This case highlights the strict obligation of court personnel to comply with notarial rules and serves as a cautionary precedent. Counsel should be aware of the potential ambiguity surrounding the definition of “availability” of other notaries public.
