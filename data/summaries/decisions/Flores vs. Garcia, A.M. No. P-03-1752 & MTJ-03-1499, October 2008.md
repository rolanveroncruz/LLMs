## Legal Document Summary: Flores v. Garcia

**Case:** A.M. No. MTJ-03-1499 & A.M. No. P-03-1752 (consolidated administrative cases)

**Parties:** Celfred P. Flores (Complainant/Respondent) vs. Judge Rodolfo B. Garcia (Respondent/Complainant)

**Nature:** Administrative complaints and counter-complaint for misconduct and falsification respectively.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   **Flores (A.M. No. MTJ-03-1499):** Alleged oppression, grave misconduct, and violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Code of Judicial Ethics by Judge Garcia. Specifically:
    *   Physical assault (boxing) and threat with a firearm outside RCBC (July 22, 2002).
    *   Physical assault (hitting the back of the head) inside the courtroom (July 24, 2002).
*   **Garcia (A.M. No. P-03-1752):** Counter-charge of falsification against Flores. Specifically:
    *   Falsification of affidavit in his complaint stating that Judge Garcia boxed him in San Carlos City as the Daily Time Record of Flores shows that he was in the court from 12:40 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on July 22, 2002.
    *   Falsifying the Affidavit of Abunda who later on executed an Affidavit of Retraction.

**Findings & Obligations:**

*   **Judge Garcia:** Found **GUILTY of Gross Misconduct** constituting violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct (Section 8(3), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court). The Court cited Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for propriety. Admitted in Pre-Trial Order.
*   **Penalty:** Fine of P20,500.00 to be deducted from withheld retirement benefits based on a previous case (A.M. OCA IPI No. 03-1403-MTJ). Prior sanctions, including fines and reprimands, were considered.
*   **Flores:** Administrative case for falsification is **DISMISSED** for lack of merit. The Court noted that he accompanied Judge Garcia on official business.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Garcia:** Monetary penalty. Although retired, subject to administrative discipline. Liable for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Evidence:** The case hinged on conflicting affidavits and testimonies, including a retraction. Credibility of witnesses was challenged.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** Retirement, length of service, reconciliation, and absence of graft were considered but outweighed by prior sanctions.
*   **Subjectivity in "Gross Misconduct":**  The determination of "gross misconduct" can be subjective and fact-dependent.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, Section 8(3):** Defining Gross Misconduct.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 4:** Concerning propriety.
*   **A.M. OCA IPI No. 03-1403-MTJ:** Prior case where retirement benefits were withheld.
*   **Relevant Cases:** Cited for the principle that a judge's conduct must be above reproach (e.g., *Torcende v. Sardido, Rosales v. Villanueva, Cacatian v. Liwanag*).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Flores's Daily Time Record and whether errands for the judge constitute "reporting for work".
*   The validity and effect of Abunda's Affidavit of Retraction. The court ultimately gave little weight to the retraction.

**Note:** The court emphasizes that reconciliation does not strip the court of its jurisdiction in administrative cases. The focus is on maintaining public trust in the judiciary, not merely resolving personal grievances. The court dismissed the joint manifestation of dismissal filed by the parties.
