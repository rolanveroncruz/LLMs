**Subject Matter:** Liability of a government cashier for the loss of funds due to robbery.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** Hermogina U. Bulilan, Cashier of Visaya State College of Agriculture (VISCA), was responsible for payroll preparation. She withdrew payroll funds, stored them in an unlocked steel cabinet after preparing individual pay envelopes, and a robbery occurred resulting in a significant loss.
*   **COA Decision:** The Commission on Audit (COA) denied Bulilan's request for relief from accountability, finding her negligent in safeguarding the funds.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Bulilan argued that she acted reasonably under the circumstances and the robbery was a fortuitous event. She also contended a concrete vault on site was not fully secure.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the COA decision, finding Bulilan negligent and liable for the loss.

**Obligations:**

*   As a government cashier, Bulilan had a legal and fiduciary duty to exercise reasonable care and diligence in the safekeeping of public funds.
*   Compliance with Joint COA-MOF Circular No. 1-81 regarding frequency of deposits.

**Liabilities:**

*   Bulilan is held liable for the loss of Php 566,468.91 due to negligence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Personal liability:** Bulilan faces personal financial responsibility for the lost funds.
*   **Administrative sanctions:** The decision could lead to further administrative penalties or disciplinary actions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 1445 (Government Auditing Code):** Section 73, concerning credit for loss occurring in transit or due to *force majeure*. The court found that Bulilan did not properly invoke this section due to negligence.
*   **Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Used improperly as it raises question of fact
*   **Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Prescribes the remedy of certiorari when seeking review of COA decision.
*   **Article IX-A, Section 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines:** The Supreme Court reviews the COA decisions under Rule 65 via Certiorari.
*   **Vicente Villaflor vs. Court of Appeals, 280 SCRA 297 [1997]:** The court cited this case as an established rule that findings or conclusions of administrative bodies are generally respected and even given finality.
*   **McKee vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 211 SCRA 517 (539):** The court cited this case to define negligence.
*   **Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 303 (320):** The court cited this case to define negligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition and assessment of "reasonable care" in safeguarding public funds. The Court deferred to the COA's assessment of the existing vault versus the unlocked cabinet.
*   Bulilan argued that the finding by the auditor was false and therefore, the claim that she did not travel to Tacloban City was incorrect.

**Summary for Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COA's decision holding Hermogina Bulilan, a government cashier, liable for the loss of funds due to robbery. The Court found her negligent for storing the funds in an unlocked cabinet despite the availability of a more secure, locked vault/room. The Court emphasized the cashier's fiduciary duty to safeguard public funds and her failure to comply with internal rules and regulations. The petition improperly raised questions of fact. Furthermore, the Court stated that the findings by the administrative body are generally respected, citing **Vicente Villaflor vs. Court of Appeals, 280 SCRA 297 [1997].** The Court also cited **McKee vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 211 SCRA 517 (539)** and **Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 303 (320)** to define what negligence is. The decision reinforces the high standard of care required of government custodians of public funds. Bulilan is now personally liable for the missing funds.
