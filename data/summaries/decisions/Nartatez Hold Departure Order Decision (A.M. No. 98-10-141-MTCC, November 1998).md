**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 98-10-141-MTCC**

**Subject Matter:** This administrative matter concerns a hold departure order (HDO) issued by Judge Juan C. Nartatez of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), Branch 3, Davao City, in Criminal Cases Nos. 68,229-C-98 to 68,231-C-98 for violations of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (Bouncing Checks Law).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation of Supreme Court Circular No. 39-97:** Judge Nartatez issued the HDO despite the circular explicitly limiting the authority to issue HDOs in criminal cases to the Regional Trial Courts (RTCs) in cases within their exclusive jurisdiction. The MTC does not have this authority.
*   **Admission of Error and Rectification:** Judge Nartatez admitted his error and issued an order recalling the HDO.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Judges' Duty of Competence:** The Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 3, Rule 3.01) obligates judges to be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence.  This requires continuous legal education and staying informed of Supreme Court issuances and jurisprudence, as per *Re: Inhibition of Judge Bienvenido R. Estrada, Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, San Carlos City, Pangasinan in Civil Case No. SCC-1822, A.M. No. 98-1-32-RTC, July 29, 1998*.
*   **Sanction:** Judge Nartatez was reprimanded and warned that repetition of similar acts would result in more severe disciplinary action.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **None apparent in the document itself,** as the judge admitted the error and rectified it. The primary risk lies in a future recurrence of similar errors, which would lead to harsher penalties.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 22:** The cases involve violations of this law.
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 39-97:** This circular is central to the issue, as it defines the jurisdiction for issuing HDOs.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 3, Rule 3.01):**  This governs the standard of conduct expected of judges.
*   *Re: Inhibition of Judge Bienvenido R. Estrada, Regional Trial Court, Branch 57, San Carlos City, Pangasinan in Civil Case No. SCC-1822, A.M. No. 98-1-32-RTC, July 29, 1998*: This case highlights the ongoing duty of judges to remain current in legal developments.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **None apparent.** The facts are straightforward, and the legal basis for the reprimand is clear. The judge's admission further simplifies the matter.
