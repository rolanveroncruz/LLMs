Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Gertrudes B. Verzosa* G.R. No. 173525, March 28, 2008 (573 Phil. 503)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's order to reconstitute Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 140606.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Judicial reconstitution of TCT No. 140606, covering a property in Quezon City, after the original was destroyed in a fire and the owner's duplicate was lost.
*   **Basis of Petition:** Sec. 3(f) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 26 (judicial reconstitution based on "any other document which, in the judgment of the court, is sufficient and proper").  Petitioner presented a photocopy of the TCT, certification of destruction, affidavit of loss, approved technical description, and tax documents.
*   **RTC Decision:** Granted the reconstitution petition.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC's decision, finding sufficient basis in the evidence.
* **OSG arguments**: The trial court erred in granting the petition because Verzosa failed to comply with the mandatory requirements under Sections 12 and 13 of RA No. 26 in relation to Section 110 of P.D. No. 1529 and failed to present clear and convincing evidence that she is the owner of said parcel of land.

**Ruling:**

*   Supreme Court **DENIED** the Republic's Petition and **AFFIRMED** the CA's decision.
*   Estoppel does not operate against the government; OSG's initial failure to object to evidence isn't a bar.
*   Even though the photocopy of TCT is secondary evidence, the combination of evidence presented (certification of loss, technical description verified by LRA, tax records) sufficiently proved the existence, execution, and contents of the original TCT.  *Republic v. Mateo* (G.R. No. 148025, 13 August 2004) discussed but distinguished, as respondent presented additional corroborating evidence.
*   Notes that all jurisdictional requirements under R.A. No. 26 were complied with. The LRA report confirmed the plan and technical description were verified and approved.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. No. 26 (Reconstitution of Lost or Destroyed Certificates of Title)
    *   Sec. 3 (Sources for Reconstitution)
    *   Sec. 12 (Requirements for Petition)
*   R.A. No. 6732 (Administrative Reconstitution)
*   Sec. 5, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court (Secondary Evidence Rule)
*   Sec. 110, P.D. No. 1529

**Case Law:**

*   *Republic v. Casimiro* (G.R. No. 166139, 20 June 2006): Importance of original owner's duplicate.
*   *Republic v. Mateo* (G.R. No. 148025, 13 August 2004): Order of presentation of secondary evidence.
*   *Republic v. Holazo* (G.R. No. 146846, 31 August 2004): Caution in reconstitution proceedings due to potential for fraud.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Reliance on Secondary Evidence:**  The core risk revolves around the reliance on secondary evidence (photocopy of title). Although deemed sufficient in this case due to corroborating evidence, future cases with weaker corroboration may face challenges.  Establishment of existence, execution, loss, and contents is crucial when relying on secondary evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the reconstitution based on the totality of evidence presented, even with the absence of the original owner's duplicate or a certified copy. This case provides precedent for admitting secondary evidence under Sec. 3(f) of RA 26 when strong corroborating evidence exists, especially when supported by LRA findings. However, emphasizes the need for strict compliance with RA 26 provisions and the Rules of Court regarding secondary evidence to mitigate potential fraud.
