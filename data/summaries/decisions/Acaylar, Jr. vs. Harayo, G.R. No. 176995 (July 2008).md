## Legal Document Summary: Acaylar, Jr. v. Harayo, G.R. No. 176995 (2008)

**Case:** Pablo D. Acaylar, Jr. v. Danilo G. Harayo, G.R. No. 176995, July 30, 2008.  This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal (on procedural grounds) of Acaylar's petition, effectively affirming the RTC and MTCC decisions awarding possession of a 30,000 sqm parcel of land (Lot 741-B-1) to Harayo.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot 741-B-1 in Dapitan City, 30,000 sqm, previously owned by the spouses Acaylar.
*   **Claim of Harayo:**  Harayo claims he purchased the property from the spouses Acaylar via a Deed of Sale (Sept 14, 2004) and took possession, but Acaylar Jr. forcibly entered the land (Sept 19, 2004). This formed the basis for a forcible entry suit.
*   **Claim of Acaylar, Jr.:**  Acaylar, Jr. contends he has been in possession since 1979 as administrator for his parents, residing on the land. He argues Harayo's claim lacks specific delineation.
*   **Conflicting Affidavits:**  Zoila Acaylar (mother of petitioner) initially executed an affidavit (First Affidavit) stating she sold the property to Harayo and didn't authorize Acaylar, Jr. to administer it. She later recanted with a Second Affidavit.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:**  The MTCC and RTC ruled in favor of Harayo, citing the Deed of Sale as evidence of his right to possession and deemed Acaylar, Jr.'s entry as forcible entry. The Court of Appeals dismissed Acaylarâ€™s petition on technical grounds.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the MTCC ordered Acaylar Jr. to vacate the property and pay attorney's fees.
*   The key determination is the *right to physical possession*.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:**  The Supreme Court notes discrepancies in the lower courts' factual findings regarding prior possession. The SC ultimately finds that Acaylar Jr. was in prior physical possession, making a forcible entry action inappropriate.
*   **Nature of Possession:** Acaylar, Jr.'s possession was arguably tolerated by his parents. The absence of *prior demand* to vacate renders an unlawful detainer action also improper (See *Arcal v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Pending Annulment Case:** A case for annulment of the Deed of Sale is pending before the RTC. The SC decision is without prejudice to the outcome of that case and/or a future action by Harayo to acquire possession.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Defines forcible entry and unlawful detainer, highlighting the different requirements for each.
*   ***Santos v. Ayon***: Outlines the distinctions between forcible entry and unlawful detainer.
*   ***Arcal v. Court of Appeals***: Establishes that possession by tolerance becomes unlawful only upon demand to vacate.
*   ***Sudaria v. Quiambao*** : Reiterates that prior physical possession is a key factor to consider, not ownership
*   ***Manuel v. Court of Appeals***: Courts in ejectment cases determine possession *de facto*, not ownership *de jure*.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The primary contention revolves around *who had prior physical possession* of the property.
*   The validity of the Deed of Sale is not directly at issue in the ejectment case, but it influences arguments related to the right to possess.
*   The recanting affidavit from Zoila Acaylar introduces doubt regarding Acaylar Jr's authority and impacts the interpretation of his possession.

**Supreme Court Ruling & Implications:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTS** the Petition for Review on Certiorari, reverses the Court of Appeals' decision, and **dismisses** Harayo's Complaint for forcible entry.
*   The SC finds that Acaylar Jr. was in prior physical possession, rendering forcible entry an improper remedy.  The absence of a demand to vacate precludes an unlawful detainer action.
*   The dismissal is *without prejudice* to Harayo pursuing other legal remedies (e.g., based on ownership after the Deed of Sale annulment case is resolved).

**Legal Advice:**

Advise Harayo that the ejectment case was dismissed on procedural grounds, not necessarily on the merits of his ownership claim. He should focus on prevailing in the pending case for annulment of the Deed of Sale. If successful in that action, he may need to file a different action to establish his right to possession. Prior to filing any new legal actions, ensure proper demand to vacate is made to perfect an action for unlawful detainer, if appropriate.
