**Case Summary: *Rivera v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 157040 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA Decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of a rescission of contract, recovery of possession, and collection of rent/sum of money case filed by Spouses Pineda against Rivera.

**Facts:** Spouses Pineda and Rivera entered into a "Deed of Mortgage with Irrevocable Option to Buy" concerning a property covered by TCT No. 146291.  Rivera mortgaged the property for P400,000.00 and was granted an option to buy for an additional P500,000.00 payable in installments. Disputes arose regarding Rivera's payment of the installments and the authenticity of a cash voucher presented as proof of full payment.

**RTC Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint, ordering Spouses Pineda to execute an absolute deed of sale and pay damages. The RTC gave credence to NBI reports which stated that the signature on the voucher was genuine, but that entries were intercalated. The Court felt the defendant showed that the document was typed and that defects in the typewriter used were the cause. 

**CA Ruling:** Reversed the RTC, rescinding the contract and ordering Rivera to return the property, pay rent, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit. It declared P83,333.35 forfeited and directed Spouses Pineda to reimburse Rivera P650,000.00 (P400,000.00 downpayment and 75% of paid installments.) The CA did not find that there was full payment of the property.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Mortgage with Irrevocable Option to Buy:** Grants Rivera an option to purchase Spouses Pineda's property for P900,000, inclusive of the mortgage. Key obligations included Rivera's installment payments and Spouses Pineda's potential obligation to convey the property if the option was properly exercised.
*   **Rescission Clause:** Allows Spouses Pineda to rescind the contract if Rivera defaults on installment payments, subject to forfeiture of 25% of prior payments but obligating them to return the mortgage amount.
*   **Mortgage:** Spouses Pineda have an obligation to pay Rivera the P400,000.00 in the even the option to purchase is not executed.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Rivera:** Initially faced potential liability for unpaid rent, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of suit.
*   **Spouses Pineda:** Had a potential liability to convey the property and pay damages, as ordered by the RTC. Ultimately, they were liable to reimburse Rivera for the downpayment and part of the installments, while they had a liability to forfeit P83,333.35.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Cash Voucher:** The core dispute revolves around the authenticity and effect of the cash voucher, raising issues of forgery, intercalation, and burden of proof under the Rules of Evidence. The NBI report's findings of intercalation, despite finding the signature genuine, created significant ambiguity.
*   **Completion of Service:** The CA's reliance on constructive notice of the decision via registered mail, despite it being returned unclaimed and Rivera's claim of lack of actual notice, raises due process concerns, potentially violating his right to appeal. The Court in *Cayetano v. Ceguerra* (1965) suggests a stricter standard of notice is required for laypersons, and the Court reasoned that due to Rivera being represented by counsel this case was to be treated differently.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 13, Section 10 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure:** Governs service by registered mail and the determination of when service is deemed complete.
*   ***Cayetano v. Ceguerra*, 121 Phil. 76 (1965):**  Cited by Rivera regarding the requirements for actual knowledge of a decision.
*   **General Principles on Rescission of Contracts:** Governed by Articles 1191 and 1385 of the Civil Code, addressing the mutual restitution required upon rescission.
*   **Doctrine of Negligence of Counsel:** Holds clients bound by the negligence of their counsel.
*   **Finality of Judgments** This case hinged on the concept of finality of judgments and the Court's reluctance to disturb final rulings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Effect of the Irrevocable Option:**  The relationship between the mortgage and the option to buy is intertwined.  The Deed lacks clarity on how payments made toward the purchase price affect the mortgage obligation if the option is not exercised.
*   **The forfeiture clause** The sixth whereas clause states 25% of payments forfeited to the mortagor but the mortgage payment of 400,000 still must be paid with no interest.

**Legal Analysis and Potential Arguments:**

*   Rivera can argue due process was violated due to ineffective notice.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' ruling.
