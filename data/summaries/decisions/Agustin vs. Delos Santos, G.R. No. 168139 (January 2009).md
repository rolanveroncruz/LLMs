## Legal Document Summary: Agustin v. Sps. Delos Santos (G.R. No. 168139, January 20, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision partly reversing an RTC decision in an ejectment case.

**Key Issue:** Whether the principle of *res judicata* bars the second ejectment suit against Petitioner Agustin.

**Facts:**

*   Respondents Sps. Delos Santos own an apartment unit occupied by Petitioner Agustin since 1990 under a verbal month-to-month lease (Art. 1687, Civil Code).
*   First Ejectment Suit (Civil Case No. 167142-CV): Filed on the ground of personal need of the premises by the respondents' family. Dismissed by the MeTC for lack of cause of action (failure to comply with requirements for ejectment on that ground). Decision became final.
*   Second Ejectment Suit (Civil Case No. 174168): Filed after respondents terminated the verbal lease agreement and gave a 30-day notice to vacate. Ground for ejectment is termination/expiration of lease.
*   MeTC ruled in favor of Respondents.
*   RTC reversed, holding that *res judicata* applied, constituting splitting a cause of action based on unlawful detainer and identity of subject matter.
*   CA partially reversed the RTC, finding that *res judicata* did not apply due to a lack of identity of causes of action. CA ordered Petitioner to vacate.

**Ruling and Key Provisions:**

The Supreme Court (SC) **denied** the petition and **affirmed** the CA decision, finding that *res judicata* did not apply as a bar to the second ejectment suit.

*   ***Res Judicata* Analysis:** The SC held that the requisites for *res judicata* under the concept of "bar by prior judgment" were not met, specifically the **identity of subject matter** and **identity of cause of action**.
    *   **Subject Matter:** Each month-to-month lease constitutes a separate contract; thus, the first and second ejectment cases involve different lease contracts (different 30-day periods). Cites *Baens v. Court of Appeals* and *La Jolla, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* on the nature of month-to-month leases.
    *   **Cause of Action:**  First ejectment suit's cause of action stemmed from violation of Respondents' rights under the Amended Rent Control Act due to "need of premises." Second ejectment suit's cause of action arose from Petitioner's unlawful possession after the termination of the lease and expiration of the 30-day notice.  Petitioner's refusal to vacate after the notice of termination created a new cause of action.  Cites Rule 2, Section 2, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on definition of cause of action.
*   **Tests for Identity of Causes of Action:**
    *   **Absence of Inconsistency Test:** A finding that the lease contract expired is not inconsistent with the earlier finding of lack of cause of action based on "need of premises."
    *   **Same Evidence Test:** The evidence required to prove ejectment based on expiration of lease is different from the evidence required to prove ejectment based on "need of premises."
*   **Conclusiveness of Judgment:** The prior MeTC decision in the first ejectment suit did *not* expressly pronounce on the issue of the expiration of the lease contract; therefore, this issue was not conclusively settled.
*   **Novation:** The acceptance of rental payments by Respondents while the petition was pending does not constitute novation as there was no express agreement or unequivocal act demonstrating *animus novandi* (intent to novate). Cites *California Bus Lines, Inc. v. State Investment House, Inc.*

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Continued Occupation & Damages:** Agustin is ordered to vacate, and faces potential liability for fair rental value (determined by the lower courts) from the date of filing the second complaint.
*   **Ambiguous Clauses:** The document doesn't contain specifically ambiguous clauses, but the interpretation of "month-to-month" leases and the creation of separate causes of action could potentially be litigated in similar situations.
*   **Rent Control Laws:** The amended Rent Control Act (mentioned in the context of the first ejectment suit) could become relevant if future rent increases are disputed.  Its application to the specific premises will need to be independently verified.
*   **Notice Requirements:** The validity and effectiveness of the termination notice are critical. Improper notice could be grounds for challenging the ejectment.
*   **Enforcement:** The decision needs to be properly enforced through appropriate court procedures.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Article 1687:** Governing month-to-month leases.
*   **Rule 2, Section 2, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Definition of cause of action.
*   **Amended Rent Control Act:** Governing rent regulations (unspecified sections).
*   ***Baens v. Court of Appeals*** and ***La Jolla, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:*** On the nature of month-to-month leases as successive, distinct contracts.
*   ***California Bus Lines, Inc. v. State Investment House, Inc.:*** On the requirement of *animus novandi* for novation.
* Other cases are cited throughout to support the application of Res Judicata.
