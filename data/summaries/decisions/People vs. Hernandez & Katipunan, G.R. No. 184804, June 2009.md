## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Hernandez and Katipunan*, G.R. No. 184804 (2009)

**Type:** Criminal Appeal (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs - Shabu)

**Holding:**  Affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, which in turn affirmed the RTC's conviction of accused-appellants Rashamia Hernandez and Grace Katipunan for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).  Appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 each.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Violation:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of *Shabu*).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** PO2 Dimacali acted as poseur-buyer and purchased 0.047 gram of shabu from the appellants. Marked money was used.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found that the actions of Hernandez and Katipunan demonstrated a conspiracy to sell the illegal drug, establishing joint liability.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented testimonial evidence (PO2 Dimacali, PO2 Carandang), documentary evidence (request for lab exam, chemistry report, marked money, affidavit of apprehension, pre-operation sheet), and object evidence (shabu).
*   **Defense:** Appellants claimed denial and frame-up, alleging extortion attempts by the police. Alibi and witness testimony provided, but deemed insufficient to overcome prosecution's evidence.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Prosecution presented the items immediately brought to the police station and marked by PO2 Dimacali as GKC for Grace Katipunan Cruz, the item was then submitted with the buy-bust money to Inspector Tiu. The plastic sachet of shabu was forwarded to the PNP Crime Laboratory of the Western Police District, U.N. Avenue, Ermita, Manila, for laboratory examination. PNP Forensic Chemist Judycel A. Macapagal found the contents thereof to be positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Appellants were found guilty as co-principals in the sale of illegal drugs.
*   Liable for life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 each.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issue (Raised on Appeal):** Appellants argued the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the seized drug and did not comply with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding post-seizure procedures (inventory, photography in presence of accused, etc.). Court ruled this argument was raised too late (on appeal) and that substantial compliance, coupled with preservation of integrity and evidentiary value, was sufficient. The court cited *People v. Sta. Maria*, G.R. No. 171019 (2007) in regards to this.

*   **Non-Presentation of Inspector Tiu:** Appellants argued the prosecution's failure to present Inspector Tiu (who received the drugs at the station) as a witness created doubt.  The Court cited *People v. Zeng Hua Dian*, G.R. No. 145348 (2004) stating that the prosecution has discretion on whom they wish to present as witnesses. The chain of custody was sufficiently established by other witnesses.
*   **Lack of Police Blotter Recording:** Appellants argued that the buy-bust operation and buy-bust money were not recorded in the police blotter, raising doubts about the veracity of the operation. The Court noted that the pre-operation/coordination sheet was made and signed by Inspector Tiu and that neither law nor jurisprudence requires that the buy-bust money be entered in the police blotter.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in the Philippines.
*   **Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165** - Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment
*   **People v. Sta. Maria, G.R. No. 171019 (2007):** Addressed the failure to raise objections at the trial court.
*   **People v. Zeng Hua Dian, G.R. No. 145348 (2004):** Discussed the discretionary right of the prosecution to present witnesses.

**Legal Advice Needed:**

*   Evaluate the strength of the chain of custody argument, given the delayed raising of the issue.
*   Assess the impact of not presenting Inspector Tiu on the overall evidence.
*   Consider potential grounds for a motion for reconsideration or further appeal.
*   Address any non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165.
