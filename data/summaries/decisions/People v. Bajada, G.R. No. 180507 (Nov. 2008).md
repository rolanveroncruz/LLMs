**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Nestor Bajada y Bautista, Victor Calisay y Loyaga, and John Doe*, G.R. No. 180507 (2008)

**Summary:**

This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the conviction of Nestor Bajada and Victor Calisay for robbery with homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended. The RTC originally sentenced them to death, but the CA modified the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* due to the absence of aggravating circumstances specifically alleged in the Information. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294(1), RPC).
*   **Facts:** Appellants Bajada and Calisay were overseers at the victim, Villamayor's farm. The victim, Villamayor and his live-in partner, Asaytono, were robbed in their home by three men, including Bajada and Calisay. Villamayor was stabbed to death and Asaytono was seriously injured. Asaytono identified the accused.
*   **Valuables Taken:** PhP 20,000.00 cash, jewelry (PhP 80,000.00), USD 500 (PhP 20,000.00), pertinent documents (totaling PhP 120,000.00)

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Defendants:** Found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of robbery with homicide and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.  Ordered to pay the heirs of Villamayor death indemnity (P50,000.00) and reasonable expenses (P78,620.00).
*   **Key Witness:** Anabelle Asaytono, provided the primary testimony identifying the accused.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistent Statements:** The defense argued that inconsistencies between Asaytono's sworn statements and her court testimony rendered her unreliable. These inconsistencies related to the identity of the caller, intoxication state, and the details of identification. The SC dismissed this argument, citing *People v. Castillano, Sr.* (2003) and *People v. Alegado* (1993), stating that sworn statements are generally inferior to court testimony and the witness was not given a chance to explain the inconsistencies.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The RTC initially considered dwelling and serious physical injury as aggravating circumstances. The CA correctly held that dwelling could not be considered because it wasn't specifically alleged in the Information. The CA applied *People v. Abdul* (1999), correctly holding that physical injuries are merged in the crime of robbery with homicide.
*   **Alibi:**  The defense presented an alibi, which was dismissed due to proximity and lack of physical impossibility to be present at the crime scene.
*   **Eyewitness Account:** The defendants provided a "Petition" with letters from an alleged eyewitness claiming Asaytono was responsible. This was rejected by the court as belated, uncorroborated, and hearsay evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294(1), Revised Penal Code (Robbery with Homicide):** Defines the crime.
*   **R.A. 7659 (Death Penalty Law):** Amended Art. 294, RPC (at the time of the RTC decision, the Death Penalty was the corresponding penalty, however the SC correctly modified this given the non-inclusion of aggravating circumstances).
*   ***People v. Mateo*:** Jurisprudence at the time mandated intermediate appellate review of death penalty cases.
*   ***People v. Abdul* (1999):** Homicide and physical injuries committed during a robbery are merged in the crime of robbery with homicide.
*   ***People v. Castillano, Sr.* (2003):** Sets forth requirements for impeaching a witness based on prior inconsistent statements (laying the predicate).
*   ***People v. Alegado* (1993):** Sworn statements are generally considered inferior to testimony in open court.
*   **Section 13, Rule 132, Revised Rules of Court:** Procedural rule for impeaching a witness with inconsistent statements.

**Conclusion:**

The SC correctly affirmed the CA decision, modifying the penalty to *reclusion perpetua*. The key factor was the strong identification of the accused by the surviving victim, Asaytono, despite minor inconsistencies in her prior statements. The defense's alibi and belatedly presented evidence were insufficient to overcome the prosecution's case.
