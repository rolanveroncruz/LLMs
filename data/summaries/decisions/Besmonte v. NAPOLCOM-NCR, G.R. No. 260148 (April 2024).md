## Legal Document Summary: *Besmonte v. NAPOLCOM-NCR* (G.R. No. 260148)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the CSC's decision finding Petitioner Besmonte, a police officer, liable for misconduct during a buy-bust operation.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Factual Background:** Besmonte participated in a buy-bust operation against Abenojar for drug offenses and resistance to authority. Abenojar alleged that Besmonte used excessive force during her arrest. The NAPOLCOM initially found Besmonte liable for inflicting unnecessary coercion and violence, ordering a one-rank demotion. The CSC increased the penalty to dismissal for Grave Misconduct, which was affirmed by the CA.
*   **Core Issue:** Did the CA err in affirming the finding of Grave Misconduct and the penalty of dismissal?
*   **Relevant Laws/Rules:**
    *   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
    *   Rule 43 of the Rules of Court (Appeal from Quasi-Judicial Agencies)
    *   Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACS)
    *   Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service
    *   Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act of 2002)
    *   Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code (Resistance and Disobedience to a Person in Authority)
    *   Rule 113 of the Rules of Court (Arrest)
    *   Revised Philippine National Police Operation Procedures (2021)

**Supreme Court Ruling and Analysis:**

*   The Supreme Court found the Petition partly meritorious, **modifying the CA decision**. The Court agreed that Besmonte used excessive force but **reclassified the offense from Grave Misconduct to Simple Misconduct**.
*   **Reasoning:** The Court acknowledged that Besmonte hit and kicked Abenojar. While Besmonte claimed it was reasonable force, he failed to justify how the specific actions were necessary. The CSC and CA focused on the lapse of judgment but failed to show corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule.
*   **PNP Rules on Use of Force:** The Court cited the PNP's rules on the use of necessary and reasonable force, emphasizing the factors a police officer must consider.
*   **Outcome:** Besmonte was found Guilty of Simple Misconduct and suspended for six (6) months.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjective Assessment of Force:** The assessment of "reasonable force" can be highly subjective and fact-dependent. There's a risk of second-guessing split-second decisions made by officers in dynamic situations.
*   **Evidentiary Weight:** The CSC gave more weight to the Medical Certificate from Dr. Eusebio because he testified.
*   **Dissenting Views:** (Not present in this decision).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of adherence to established rules in arrest. It also sets a precedent for applying a stricter scrutiny to findings of "Grave Misconduct," emphasizing the need to prove corruption, intent, or flagrant disregard, rather than a mere error in judgment.
