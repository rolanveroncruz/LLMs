**Case Summary: *People v. Cabilida, Jr.* G.R. No. 222964 (2018)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant, Cajeto Cabilida, Jr., for two counts of rape.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charges:** Two counts of rape under the Revised Penal Code (RPC).  The amended informations allege the rapes were committed with force and intimidation, in the victim's (AAA) home, in the presence of her minor children. Aggravating circumstances alleged include commission in the full view of the victim's minor children and dwelling.
*   **Prosecution's Version:** AAA testified that the appellant, accompanied by another individual, forcibly entered her home and raped her twice. Her minor daughter, BBB, corroborated AAA's account.
*   **Defense's Version:** Appellant claimed consensual sexual relations with AAA ("sweetheart theory"), alleging a pre-existing illicit affair. Denied the use of force or intimidation. Presented witness testimony (Dennis) to suggest a prior relationship.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt on both counts of rape. Rejected the "sweetheart theory."
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Obligation to serve two penalties of *reclusion perpetua* (life imprisonment).
*   **Appellant:** Liable to pay the victim civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. Increased upon review to P100,000.00 each for each count of rape
* **Appellant:** The Court orders that damages earn interest at a rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **"Sweetheart Theory":** The court roundly rejected the defense of consent based on a supposed affair.  Case law establishes that prior relationships do not negate rape if the act is non-consensual (*People v. Magbanua, 576 Phil. 642, 648 (2008)*).
*   **Lack of Medical Evidence:** The court held that a medical certificate is *not* indispensable for a rape conviction.  The victim's testimony, if clear, positive, and convincing, is sufficient (*People v. Balonzo, 560 Phil. 244, 259-260 (2007)*). This shifts the evidentiary burden to the defense to rebut the victim's credibility.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies:** The Court emphasized that minor inconsistencies in witness testimonies do not necessarily undermine credibility, but rather can bolster it. *People v. Hilet, 450 Phil. 481, 490 (2003).*
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The presence of the victim's children and the commission of the crime in her dwelling resulted in the imposition of the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines rape and its penalties.
*   **R.A. No. 7610, R.A. No. 9262, and Section 40 of A.M. No. 04-10-11-SC:**  Shielding the identity of victims.
*   *People v. Domingo, 432 Phil. 590, 607 (2002):* A woman will not expose herself to the humiliation of a trial, with its attendant publicity and the morbid curiosity it would arouse, unless she has been truly wronged and seeks atonement for her abuse.
*   *People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 848 (2016):* prevailing jurisprudence to increase the awards of civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to P100,000.00 each for each count of rape.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** N/A

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, emphasizing the credibility of the victim's testimony, the insufficiency of the "sweetheart theory," and the non-necessity of medical evidence. The key takeaway is the Supreme Court's reliance on the testimony of the victim and corroborating testimony of her daughter as grounds for its decision. The court emphasized the gravity of the circumstances. The judgment is final and executory.
