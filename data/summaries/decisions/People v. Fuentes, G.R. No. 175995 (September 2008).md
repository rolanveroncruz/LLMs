## Legal Document Summary: People v. Fuentes, G.R. No. 175995

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Edwin Fuentes y Carson*, G.R. No. 175995 (2008).

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Edwin Fuentes y Carson for murder.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), alleging deliberate intent to kill with treachery and evident premeditation.
*   **Facts:** The prosecution established that Fuentes stabbed the victim, Manuel Guira, while Guira was alighting from a tricycle. Witness testimony positively identified Fuentes as the perpetrator.
*   **Defense:** Fuentes asserted denial and alibi, claiming he was asleep in a docked pilot boat.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of murder, finding the alibi refuted by positive identification, sentencing Fuentes to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision *in toto*.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied the appeal, affirming the CA decision with modifications to damages.
*   **Treachery:** Both lower courts found that the suddenness of the attack constituted treachery.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua* (as per Article 248, RPC, amended by RA 7659) without eligibility for parole (RA 9346, Section 3).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Fuentes is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* and all associated accessory penalties.
*   Fuentes is liable to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   Civil indemnity: P75,000.00
    *   Moral damages: P50,000.00
    *   Exemplary damages: P25,000.00 (due to the presence of treachery, citing Article 2230 of the Civil Code).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Evident Premeditation:** While the Information alleges evident premeditation, the courts' decisions focus solely on treachery as the qualifying circumstance. The absence of a finding regarding evident premeditation could be argued as an error in the Information, though it did not ultimately impact the conviction given the presence of treachery.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The finding of guilt rests primarily on eyewitness testimony regarding the act, with minimal evidence presented on Fuentes' motive. The defense could argue that the prosecution failed to fully explore motive, though the positive identification significantly weakens this argument.
*   **Review of Factual Findings:**  As an appeal, the Supreme Court generally defers to the factual findings of the lower courts, provided they are supported by substantial evidence. Successfully challenging the factual determination of treachery would be difficult but crucial for appeal.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines murder and prescribes the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* to death.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 7659:** Amended Article 248 of the RPC.
*   **Republic Act (RA) 9346, Section 3:** Prohibits parole for individuals sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Article 2230, Civil Code:** Allows for exemplary damages when a crime is committed with an aggravating circumstance.
*   **People v. Mateo, G.R. Nos. 147678-87 (2004):** Governed the referral of the case to the Court of Appeals.
*   **People v. de la Cruz, G.R. No. 171272 (2007) and People v. Tubongbanua, G.R. No. 171271 (2006):** Cited for the mandatory award of civil indemnity and moral damages, respectively.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed Fuentes' conviction for murder due to the eyewitness testimony and the presence of treachery. The final judgment orders *reclusion perpetua* without parole and requires Fuentes to pay significant damages to the victim's heirs. A potential area of focus for appeal (if possible) would be challenging the established facts supporting treachery.
