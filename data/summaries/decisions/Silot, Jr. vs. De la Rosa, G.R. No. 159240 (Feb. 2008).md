## Legal Document Summary - *Silot v. De la Rosa* (G.R. No. 159240)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals Decision affirming with modification the RTC's Joint Decision in two consolidated civil cases: (1) *De la Rosa v. Silot* for recovery of overpayment and (2) *Silot v. De la Rosa* for insufficient payment in a construction contract.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Construction Contract:** Gregorio Silot, Jr. (Petitioner) and Estrella de la Rosa (Respondent) entered into a contract for the construction of a dormitory-apartment building. Silot supplied the labor, De la Rosa paid 33% of the total value of the materials.
*   **Dispute:** De la Rosa claimed overpayment; Silot countered with insufficient payment claim.
*   **Counsel's Admission:** During trial, Silot's counsel, Atty. San Jose, admitted the substance of the proposed testimony of De la Rosa's witness, Ariel Goingo, which detailed the total cost of materials, payments made, and the resulting overpayment by De la Rosa.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, which ordered Silot to return the overpayment of P191,525.02 to De la Rosa and pay P20,000 in attorney's fees.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Silot:** Obligated to return P191,525.02 to De la Rosa. Liable for P20,000 in attorney's fees.
*   **De la Rosa:** No further obligations. Successfully recovered overpayment.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Binding Nature of Counsel's Admission:** The core issue is whether Atty. San Jose's admission constitutes a binding judicial admission that is conclusive on Silot.
*   **Lack of Special Power of Attorney:** Silot argued that his counsel lacked a special power of attorney to make such a crucial admission, implying the admission was unauthorized and therefore not binding. The court dismissed this argument by saying the actions are performed by the lawyer as an agent of the party
*   **Unjust Enrichment Argument:** Silot argued that De la Rosa would be unjustly enriched if she was not compelled to pay for the additional labor provided. The Court rejected this argument, citing the judicial admission made by Silot's counsel.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129, Section 4:** Judicial admissions do not require proof and may not be contradicted unless made through palpable mistake.
*   **People v. Hernandez (G.R. No. 108028):** Admissions made to dispense with proof are judicial admissions.
*   **Toh v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 140274):** Admission of a witness's proposed testimony renders further examination unnecessary.
*   **Ongson v. People (G.R. No. 156169):** A party is bound by their unqualified admissions.
*   **Republic v. Sarabia (G.R. No. 157847):** Admissions in pleadings are conclusive.
*   **Juani v. Alarcon (G.R. No. 166849):** Clients are generally bound by their counsel's negligence.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The central contentious issue is whether the counsel's admission was a "palpable mistake" warranting its retraction, as per Rule 129, Section 4. The Court found no such mistake.
*   The definition and scope of "additional works" and whether they were already accounted for in the initial 33% agreement is at the heart of the dispute, but this was effectively settled by the judicial admission.
