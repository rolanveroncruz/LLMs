## Legal Document Summary: Favor v. Untalan, A.M. No. RTJ-08-2158

**Nature:** Disciplinary case against Judge Cesar O. Untalan for alleged misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   Complainant Alfredo Favor alleged:
    *   **Illegal Trespass to Dwelling:** Violation of Article 280 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) due to forceful entry (putting foot in door) into Favor's residence.
    *   **Abuse of Office:** Acting as an agent to sell real property and assisting in settling a case for a private individual (Lozada).
    *   **Harassment/Coercion:** Intimidation to vacate the property.
    *   **Violation of Rule 3.09, Code of Judicial Conduct:** Inapplicable, deals with supervision of court personnel.
*   Judge Untalan denied forceful entry, claiming he was invited in. He admitted assisting in settling the property dispute but asserted it was a neighborly act.

**Findings:**

*   **Trespass to Dwelling and Harassment/Coercion:**  Dismissed due to lack of corroborating evidence and complainant's delay in reporting the incident.  Investigating Justice found that the charges were likely concocted to leverage estafa charges filed against the complaint. *Marzalado, Jr. v. People of the Philippines, G.R. No. 152997, November 10, 2004, 441 SCRA 595, 603.* defines elements of trespass.
*   **Abuse of Office/Agency to Sell:** Dismissed; no evidence showed Judge Untalan represented Lozada in selling property.
*   **Assisting a Private Individual to Settle a Case:** Judge Untalan was found guilty of violating Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   Judge Untalan: Violated Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically regarding the use of judicial prestige for private interests.  He has a continuous duty to avoid impropriety per *Miranda v. Judge Mangrohang, A.M. No. RTJ-01-1665, November 29, 2001, 371 SCRA 20, 25.*
*   **Penalty:**  Fine of P5,000.00 with a stern warning.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Appearance of Impropriety":**  The Code of Judicial Conduct's emphasis on avoiding even the appearance of impropriety is broad and can be subjectively interpreted, potentially leading to future disputes.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The delay in reporting the alleged trespass to dwelling and harassment could be construed as an act of the petitioner being a "afterthought" of the petitioner.
*   **The facts of the case are of the petitioner's own admission and not substantially corroborated by any other sources.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 280:** Defines and penalizes trespass to dwelling.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2, Rules 2.01, 2.03:**  Governs judicial behavior, prohibiting impropriety and the use of judicial prestige for private interests.
*   *Santos v. Judge Lacurom, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1823, August 28, 2006, 499 SCRA 639.* - emphasizes the complainant has the burden of proving allegations with substantial evidence in administrative proceedings.
* *Miranda v. Judge Mangrohang, A.M. No. RTJ-01-1665, November 29, 2001, 371 SCRA 20, 25.*

**Conclusion:**

While the more serious allegations of trespass and coercion were dismissed due to lack of evidence, Judge Untalan was found liable for violating the Code of Judicial Conduct by improperly involving himself in a private dispute, creating an appearance of impropriety. The fine and warning serve as a reminder of the high ethical standards expected of judges.
