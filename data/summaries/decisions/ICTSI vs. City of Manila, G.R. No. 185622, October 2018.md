## Legal Document Summary - ICTSI v. City of Manila

**Case:** International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) v. The City of Manila, et al., G.R. No. 185622, October 17, 2018 (842 Phil. 173)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari regarding a local business tax dispute.

**Key Issue:** Whether ICTSI is entitled to a refund of business taxes paid under Section 21(A) of Manila Ordinance No. 7794, as amended, arguing that its imposition constituted direct double taxation, and whether it complied with the procedural requirements under the Local Government Code (LGC) for claiming a refund.

**Factual Background:**

*   ICTSI paid two local business taxes to Manila: one under Section 18 (contractor's tax) and another under Section 21(A) of the Manila Ordinance.
*   ICTSI protested the assessment under Section 21(A) and sought a refund of payments.
*   The City Treasurer did not act on the protest in a timely manner, prompting ICTSI to file a petition for certiorari and prohibition in the RTC.
*   The RTC and subsequently the CTA ruled on the matter, with the CTA ultimately ordering a refund of taxes for the first three quarters of 1999 but denying refunds for subsequent periods due to alleged procedural deficiencies.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 18, Manila Ordinance No. 7794:** Contractor's tax.
*   **Section 21(A), Manila Ordinance No. 7794 (as amended):** The provision imposing the disputed business tax.
*   **Section 195, Local Government Code (RA 7160):** Procedure for protesting tax assessments.  Requires written protest within 60 days of assessment notice, and appeal to court within 30 days of denial or inaction by the treasurer.
*   **Section 196, Local Government Code (RA 7160):** Procedure for claiming a refund of taxes, fees, or charges erroneously or illegally collected.  Requires a written claim for refund with the local treasurer and filing a case in court within two years from payment or entitlement to refund.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **ICTSI's Obligation:** To comply with the procedural requirements of either Section 195 or 196 of the LGC to successfully claim a refund of illegally or erroneously collected taxes.
*   **City of Manila's Liability:** Potential liability to refund taxes illegally collected under Section 21(A), if the Court finds the ordinance to be invalid and that ICTSI complied with procedural requirements.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issue (Docket Fees):** The City argues the RTC lacked jurisdiction over the claims for refund from the fourth quarter of 1999 onwards due to insufficient docket fees paid by ICTSI for its Amended and Supplemental Petition.  *Reference: Manchester Development Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, which states that non-payment of docket fees prevents the court from acquiring jurisdiction. However, the SC applied the *Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion* ruling, finding no deliberate attempt to defraud the court and the possibility of paying the deficiency.
*   **Choice of Remedy (Sections 195 vs. 196):** A major point of contention is whether ICTSI's claim falls under Section 195 (protest of assessment) or Section 196 (claim for refund). The CTA found ICTSI to be limited to Section 195 due to its initial protest of the assessment, but the Supreme Court disagreed.
*   **Compliance with Section 196 (Written Claims for Refund):**  The CTA and the City argue ICTSI failed to make specific written claims for refund for each tax payment *after* the first three quarters of 1999. However, the SC allowed for an exception to the Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies doctrine, citing that it would be a futile action due to previous denials.  *Reference: Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. Central Bank.*
*   **Timeliness:** The City argues that ICTSI did not file its claims for refund within the two-year prescriptive period under Section 196.
*   **Notice of Assessment**: The Supreme Court relied upon CTA Associate Justice Casanova's dissent, finding that the City never issued a notice of assessment, thus, Section 195 does not apply.

**Case Law & Implications:**

*   **Manchester Development Corp. v. Court of Appeals:** Relevant regarding jurisdiction based on payment of correct docket fees.
*   **Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion:** Applied to excuse the deficiencies in the payment of docket fees, due to ICTSI not intending to defraud the court, and a willingness to pay the deficiency once requested.
*   **Central Azucarera Don Pedro v. Central Bank:**  Relied upon regarding exceptions to exhaustion of administrative remedies when it would be an idle ceremony.
*   **City of Manila v. Cosmos Bottling Corp.:** Provides a framework for the difference between Sections 195 and 196 claims.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** ICTSI's petition, reversed the CTA En Banc's decision, and directed the CTA to resolve the merits of ICTSI's claim. The SC found that it had not failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or filed outside the two year claim of refund window.

**Overall Assessment & Advice:**

This case is significant because it clarifies the interplay between Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC and sets a high bar for determining direct double taxation by LGUs. It could provide precedent for others in similar situations.
