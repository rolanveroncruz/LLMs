**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Alberto Crespo Poblete*, G.R. No. 121003 (April 20, 1998)

**Summary:**

This case involves Alberto Crespo Poblete's appeal against his conviction on three counts: (1) illegal possession of ammunition (PD 1866), (2) illegal possession of marijuana (RA 6425, Sec. 8, Art. II), and (3) illegal possession of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) (RA 6425, Sec. 16, Art. III). The evidence against Poblete stemmed from a search conducted at his residence pursuant to valid search warrants. The items seized formed the basis for the charges.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Search Warrants:** The search warrants were deemed validly issued based on prior surveillance and the examination of witnesses (SPO1 Facundo Baricuatro, Jr. and PO2 Fernando Lopez) by the RTC judge.
*   **Witness Testimony:**  The prosecution relied heavily on police officers' testimonies and that of Barangay Captain Tiburcio Luna, who claimed to have witnessed the search. The defense presented conflicting testimony from Barangay Councilor Quirino del Rosario, who disputed the presence of Luna and the circumstances of the discoveries.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The illegal items were confiscated and logged in a Receipt of Properties Seized.
*   **RTC Decision:** The RTC found Poblete guilty on all counts, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* for illegal possession of ammunition and indeterminate sentences plus fines for the drug offenses.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused's primary obligation was to abide by the laws regarding possession of illegal substances and ammunition.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused was found liable for violating Sec. 8, Art. II, and Sec. 16 Art. III of RA 6425, and PD 1866.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Issues Raised on Appeal:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The appeal hinges largely on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses vs. defense witnesses, particularly the conflicting accounts of Luna and Del Rosario regarding the conduct and witnessing of the search.
*   **Circumstances of the Search:** The defense argued that the accused and his family were prevented from properly witnessing the search and that the evidence was planted. This claim was not deemed credible by the Supreme Court.
*   **Penalty for Illegal Possession of Ammunition:** The Supreme Court modified the penalty for illegal possession of ammunition, finding that the RTC erred in imposing *reclusion perpetua* without considering mitigating or aggravating circumstances. The penalty should be within the range of *prision mayor* to *reclusion temporal*.  Note that PD 1866 was later amended by RA 8294 reducing the penalty, but the court stated that amendment did not apply to those already under appeal at the time.
*   **Fines for Drug Offenses:** The Supreme Court removed the fines imposed by the RTC on the illegal possession of drugs, pursuant to an amendment by RA 7659 of the second paragraph in Section 20 of RA 6425.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), Sections 8 and 16 (as amended)**: These sections define the offenses of illegal possession of prohibited and regulated drugs, respectively. RA 7659 amended penalty provisions.
*   **PD 1866 (Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition)**:  This law defines and penalizes the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition and was later amended by RA 8294

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty for illegal possession of ammunition and deleted the fines imposed for the drug offenses.
