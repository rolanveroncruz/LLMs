**Case Summary: *Pedro Perez v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 201414, April 18, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court judgment finding Pedro Perez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) in relation to Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (Acts of Lasciviousness).

**Facts:** Perez was charged with inserting his finger into the vagina and mashing the breasts of a 12-year-old girl (AAA). The prosecution presented AAA's testimony, corroborated by a medico-legal report indicating physical abuse. The defense presented denial and alibi, which were rejected by the lower courts.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of guilt for child abuse under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, modifying only the penalty. The Court emphasized that "lust is no respecter of time and place" and that the victim's attire and the presence of other persons nearby did not preclude the commission of the offense. It also held that the victim's failure to shout or struggle did not negate her testimony, citing behavioral psychology principles.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA 7610, Section 5(b):**  Criminalizes acts of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.  Victim was under 12 years of age, triggering application of this provision.
*   **Elements of the offense under RA 7610 Sec. 5(b):** The accused commits an act of lascivious conduct with a child exploited or subjected to other sexual abuse, and the child is under 18 years of age. The court clarified that coercion of a child is sufficient to establish the second element as they are deemed exploited.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Perez was found guilty of violating RA 7610, Section 5(b).
*   **Civil Liability:** Ordered to pay civil indemnity (P50,000.00), moral damages (P50,000.00), and exemplary damages (P30,000.00), plus costs of suit.  All damages are subject to interest at 6% per annum from the date of finality of the judgment.

**Penalties:**

*   Indeterminate penalty of fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Argument of Impossibility:** The defense argued that the act was improbable given the victim's clothing and proximity to others.  The Court rejected this argument, stating that lust disregards time and place.
*   **Defense argument that the medico-legal report was inconclusive:** The defense highlighted the doctor's statement that the injuries can likewise be inflicted in a consensual relationship.
*   **Element of Exploitation/Abuse:** The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove the element of exploitation or other sexual abuse. The Court held that coercion established this element.
*   **Delay in raising questions about the Information:** The petitioner's late challenge to the nature of the indictment was noted, potentially weakening his arguments.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7610, Section 5(b):** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 336:** Acts of Lasciviousness.
*   **People v. Awas, G.R. No. 203114, June 28, 2017:** Standard of behavior for victims of crimes against chastity.
*   **People v. Barcela, 734 Phil. 332 (2014):** Reaction of a minor when something extremely and unexpectedly dreadful happens.
*    **People v. Villacampa, G.R. No. 216057, January 8, 2018:** Second element of exploitation, coercion and abuse.
*   **People v. Amarela, G.R. Nos. 225642-43, January 17, 2018:** Credibility and reliability of victim's statement.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "subjected to other sexual abuse" under RA 7610, Section 5(b), and whether proof of coercion alone is sufficient to satisfy this element, although the Court's ruling provides clarity here.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, applying RA 7610 broadly to protect children from sexual abuse. The Court's reliance on AAA's testimony, supported by the medico-legal report, was central to the decision. This case affirms that defenses based on supposed impossibility, victim behavior, or the presence of other people are generally insufficient to overturn convictions in child abuse cases when the victim's testimony is credible and corroborated.
