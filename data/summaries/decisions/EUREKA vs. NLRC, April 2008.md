## Legal Document Summary: Eureka Personnel vs. NLRC and Bueno (G.R. No. 163013)

This case involves a petition for review on *certiorari* challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of Eureka Personnel's (Petitioner) special civil action for *certiorari* against the NLRC's decision awarding salary differentials to Apolonio Bueno (Respondent), an OFW.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Respondent was hired as a mechanic but worked as a carpenter for lower pay.
*   **Salary Differential:** The central issue revolves around the difference between the contracted mechanic salary and the carpenter salary actually paid.
*   **Repatriation:** Respondent was repatriated after an injury and refusing to work.
*   **Procedural Deficiency (Crux of the Ruling):** The Court of Appeals dismissed Petitioner's *certiorari* petition due to failure to comply with **Rule 65, Section 1** and **Rule 46, Section 3** of the Rules of Court, specifically the requirement to attach relevant pleadings and documents (complaint, contract, position papers, Labor Arbiter's decision).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Eureka Personnel):** Jointly and severally liable with its principal (Saudi Archirodon) for salary differentials if the underlying labor claim is valid.
*   **Liability for Underpayment:** Potentially liable for the difference between the promised mechanic salary and the actual carpenter salary for the duration of the employment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Affirmation of NLRC Decision:** If the underlying labor claim is valid, the Petitioner remains jointly and severally liable for the awarded salary differential.
*   **Precedential Value:**  The decision reinforces strict adherence to procedural rules in filing *certiorari* petitions, particularly regarding document submission.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Section 1, Rules of Court:**  Governs *certiorari* petitions, including the requirement for attached documents.
*   **Rule 46, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Details the contents of petitions and the effect of non-compliance, leading to dismissal.
*   **Manila Hotel Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143574:** (Cited in the document) addresses when the rules can be liberally construed.
*   **Jose v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 128646:** (Cited in the document) discusses the standard for liberal construction of the rules.
*   **Labor Code:** Impliedly referenced, as it governs the underlying labor dispute.
*   **Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) law:** Impliedly, because the Complainant is an OFW.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reasonableness of Requiring Specific Documents:** Petitioner argued that the documents not submitted were not "material to the issue." However, the Court disagreed, finding them necessary to assess the basis of the salary claim.
*   **Application of Liberal Construction of Rules:** The Court rejected Petitioner's argument for liberal construction, emphasizing the lack of a "cogent reason" to deviate from strict compliance, and faulting them for not rectifying the deficiency when given the chance to do so in their motion for reconsideration.

**In essence, the Court upheld the dismissal due to a procedural defect, emphasizing strict adherence to the Rules of Court, particularly regarding the attachment of essential documents in a *certiorari* petition. This effectively leaves the merits of the underlying labor dispute (salary differential) unresolved by the appellate court and solidifies the NLRC's decision due to lack of recourse.**
