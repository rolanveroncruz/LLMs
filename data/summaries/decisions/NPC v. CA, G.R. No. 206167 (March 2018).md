**Legal Document Summary: NPC v. CA, Muzones (G.R. No. 206167)**

**Case Overview:** This case involves a petition for *certiorari* filed by the National Power Corporation (NPC) challenging a Court of Appeals (CA) decision that dismissed NPC's prior petition for being filed out of time. The core issue concerns attorney's fees claimed by Atty. Muzones (counsel for the Spouses Javellana) in a land dispute with NPC.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contingency Fee Agreement:** A legal services contract between Spouses Javellana and Atty. Muzones stipulated a contingency fee of 12.5% of the "award or monetary consideration realized."
*   **RTC Orders:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) initially ordered NPC and Transco (jointly) to pay Atty. Muzones P52,469,660.00 as attorney's lien, separate from the amount paid to the Spouses Javellana.
*   **Compromise Settlement:** Transco settled with the Spouses Javellana for P80,380,822.00.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA dismissed NPC's petition questioning the RTC orders due to procedural errors and being filed out of time.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **NPC Liability (Overturned):** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA decision and MODIFIED the RTC orders, explicitly DELETING the joint and solidary liability of NPC and Transco for the attorney's fees.  NPC is *not* liable for Atty. Muzones' fees, as the attorney-client relationship exists solely between Atty. Muzones and the Spouses Javellana.
*   **Spouses Javellana Liability:** The SC clarified that the obligation to pay the attorney's fees rests solely with the Spouses Javellana. Atty. Muzones retains the right to pursue a separate action against them for satisfaction of his fees.
*   **Atty. Muzones' Fee Calculation:** The SC determined that the contingency fee should be calculated based on the actual settlement amount received by the Spouses Javellana (P80,380,822.00), resulting in a fee of P10,047,602.75, instead of the amount based on the original award of P419,757,280.00

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  The SC noted that *certiorari* is only proper in the absence of other adequate remedies.  NPC's initial filing under Rule 65 was deemed incorrect because a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 would be proper.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals to the Supreme Court via petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Rayos v. Atty. Hernandez, 544 Phil. 447 (2007):**  Discusses the validity and court supervision of contingent fee agreements.
*   **Atty. Gubat v. National Power Corporation, 627 Phil. 551 (2010):** Affirms a client's right to settle a case without attorney intervention, but emphasizes the lawyer's right to reasonable compensation.
*   **Art. 1311 of the New Civil Code**: principle of relativity of contracts (contracts only bind the parties, their heirs, and assigns).
*   **Malayang Manggagawa ng Stayfast Phils., Inc. v. NLRC, et al., 716 Phil. 500 (2013).** Affirmed the prohibition of certiorari where the remedy of appeal is present.
*   **Sps. Dycoco v. CA, et. al., 715 Phil. 550, 560 (2013).** Defined the parameters in availing a petition for certiorari.
*   **Atty. Agustin, et al. v. Cruz-Herrera, 726 Phil. 533, 549 (2014).** Affirmed the principle that payment of attorney's fees is the personal obligation of the clients.
*   **Ramon R. Villarama v. Atty. Clodualdo C. De Jesus, G.R. No. 217004, April 17, 2017.** Defined when a contingent fee agreement is permitted.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Computation of Contingency Fee:** The main contention revolved around *what* amount the contingency fee should be calculated on. The RTC and Atty. Muzones argued based on the original award, while the SC clarified it should be based on the actual settlement amount.

**Potential Further Actions (for Atty. Muzones):**

*   File a collection suit against the Spouses Javellana to recover the P10,047,602.75 in attorney's fees. The success of this action will depend on the terms of the contract between Atty. Muzones and Spouses Javellana, and whether any defenses, such as unreasonableness or breach of contract, exist.
