**Case Summary: Manila Shipmanagement & Manning, Inc. v. Aninang, G.R. No. 217135 (2018)**

**Core Issue:**  Whether the seafarer (Aninang) is entitled to disability benefits despite failing to comply with the mandatory 3-day post-employment medical examination requirement under the POEA-SEC.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and reinstated the NLRC decision, denying Aninang's disability claim due to non-compliance with the 3-day reporting rule.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC Section 20(A)(3):** Governs compensation for work-related illnesses suffered during the contract term. Includes wages, medical treatment, sickness allowance, and reimbursement of expenses.
*   **Mandatory 3-Day Reporting Requirement:** Seafarer *must* submit to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three (3) working days of arrival in the Philippines (except when physically incapacitated, in which case written notice is required per Section 20(A)(c)). Failure to comply results in forfeiture of disability benefits.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  Seafarer bears the burden to prove compliance with the 3-day rule and the work-relatedness of the illness.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Employer Liability:** Generally liable for disability benefits if the illness is work-related and reported within the 3-day period.  However, strict compliance by the seafarer is a condition precedent.
*   **Seafarer Forfeiture:**  Failure to adhere to the 3-day rule *automatically* results in forfeiture of the right to claim disability benefits.
*   **Risk of Conflicting Factual Findings:** This case highlights the risk of conflicting factual findings between the Labor Arbiter (LA), National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), and Court of Appeals (CA) regarding compliance with the 3-day rule.  The Supreme Court intervened due to these discrepancies.
* Risk of fabricating evidence to prove compliance with POEA-SEC.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (2010 Amended Standard Terms):** The primary contract governing the employment terms and conditions of Filipino seafarers.
*   **Scanmar Maritime Services, Inc. v. De Leon, G.R. No. 199977 (2017):** Reaffirms the mandatory nature of the 3-day reporting requirement.
*   **InterOrient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Creer III, 743 Phil. 164 (2014):**  Non-compliance with the 3-day rule is fatal to the seafarer's claim.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs Petitions for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court, generally limited to questions of law.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Justifiable Cause Exception:** The LA erroneously created an exception for "non-medical repatriation," which the Supreme Court rejected. The only recognized exception is physical incapacity with written notice.
*   **Seafarer's Claimed Attempted Compliance:**  Aninang alleged he reported to the manning agency but was refused referral to a company-designated physician.  The Supreme Court found this assertion unsubstantiated due to lack of evidence (witnesses, specific dates, details of the refusal).
*   **Causation:** While the CA emphasized the work-relatedness of the illness, the Supreme Court did not reach this issue because of the initial failure to comply with the reporting requirement.

**Legal Precision & Key Takeaways:**

*   Strict adherence to the 3-day reporting requirement is paramount for seafarers seeking disability benefits. This is interpreted strictly and is required, regardless of the seafarer's medical condition.
*   Self-serving allegations, without corroborating evidence, are insufficient to prove compliance.
*   The Supreme Court is hesitant to disturb factual findings of labor tribunals, but will intervene when there are conflicting findings or misapprehensions of fact.
