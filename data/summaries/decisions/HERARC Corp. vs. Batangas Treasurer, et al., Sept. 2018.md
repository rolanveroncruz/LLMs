**Legal Document Summary: *Herarc Corporation v. Provincial Treasurer of Batangas***

**Case:** G.R. No. 210736, September 05, 2018 (839 Phil. 848)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the RTC decision holding Herarc Realty Corporation liable for deficiency real property tax (RPT).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Property:** Thirteen parcels of land in Calatagan, Batangas, registered under Herarc's name since 2006.
*   **Tax Years in Dispute:** 2007, 2008, and January to August 12, 2009.
*   **Possession During Relevant Period:** Private respondents (Manalo, Oliva, Yap) were in actual possession as assignees in insolvency proceedings from March 2, 2006 to August 12, 2009. Herarc took possession on August 13, 2009, following a court order.
*   **RPT Assessment:** Provincial Treasurer assessed Herarc for P8,093,256.89, including the disputed RPT, which was paid under protest.
*   **Herarc's Argument:** RPT assessment is illegal because Herarc did not possess the property during the covered period. They cited *Testate Estate of Concordia T. Lim v. City of Manila* and *Government Service Insurance System v. City Treasurer* to argue the tax should be charged to the person with actual/beneficial use (i.e., the private respondents).
*   **RTC Ruling:** Denied Herarc's petition, stating that since Herarc is a taxable juridical person (not tax-exempt), the registered owner is liable for the RPT because the unpaid taxes attach to the land.

**Obligations:**

*   Herarc, as the registered owner, is obligated to pay the RPT. The court did not make the private respondents obligated to pay the RPT.

**Liabilities:**

*   Herarc is liable for the RPT deficiency for the years in question.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Missed Appeal Deadline:** Herarc initially filed directly with the RTC; the court notes the correct venue for appeal should have been the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), pursuant to RA 9282 Sec. 7(a)(3). Failure to properly appeal to the CTA risks the assessment becoming final and unappealable. This issue is Jurisdictional
*   **Unsuccessful Legal Argument:** Herarc's reliance on the "beneficial user" concept was rejected by the RTC because those cases involved tax-exempt entities as the registered owner, whereas Herarc is a taxable entity.
*   **Precedent:** This case affirms the general rule that the owner is primarily liable for RPT, even if another party has beneficial use, *unless* the owner is a tax-exempt entity.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC), RA 7160, Book II, Title II:** Governs RPT.
*   **RA 9282, Section 7(a)(3):**  Jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) over RTC decisions in local tax cases.
*   **LGC Section 234:** Exemptions from RPT.
*   **LGC Section 133(o):** Limitations on taxing powers of local government units regarding the national government.
*   **LGC Section 199(b):** Definition of actual use.

**Case Law:**

*   **Testate Estate of Concordia T. Lim v. City of Manila (261 Phil. 602):** Cited by Herarc, but distinguished by the court as involving a tax-exempt owner.
*   **Government Service Insurance System v. City Treasurer and City Assessor of the City of Manila (623 Phil. 964):** Cited by Herarc, but distinguished similar to *Concordia T. Lim*.
*   **City of Pasig versus Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. 185023, August 24, 2011:** Cited by the RTC as a modification to beneficial user where the owner is responsible to pay if the beneficial user does not.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of "beneficial use" principle is contentious. While RPT attaches to the property, the applicability of this rule to a non-exempt owner vs. a tax-exempt owner has proven to be the main issue in this case. The RTC's interpretation appears to give greater weight to the owner's tax status than to the actual possessor's use of the property during the period for which the tax is assessed. The issue of jurisdiction with the proper venue for appeal is also a major factor.
