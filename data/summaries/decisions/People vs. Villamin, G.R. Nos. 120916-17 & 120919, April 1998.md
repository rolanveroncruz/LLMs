**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **People v. Esquila, G.R. No. 116727, 27 February 1996, 254 SCRA 145, 146.:** Cited to support the credibility of a young victim's testimony despite minor inconsistencies.
*   **People v. Gozum, 135 SCRA 295 [1995]:** Supports the idea that contradictions in testimony might not destroy one's credibility.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **None apparent in the summary of the decision.** The decision focused on factual findings and application of established legal principles.

**Key Points for Lawyer:**

*   The Supreme Court gave considerable weight to the testimony of the young victim.
*   Villamin's alibi was weak and easily dismissed due to proximity to the crime scene.
*   The decision reinforces the principle that minor inconsistencies in a victim's testimony, especially in cases involving young victims, do not necessarily undermine their credibility.
*   The court dismissed the psychological state of mind made by Dr. Roderick Ramos as it was hearsay.
*   The increase in the indemnity award suggests a heightened emphasis on compensating victims of sexual assault.
