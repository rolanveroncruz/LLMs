**Case Summary: *Galero v. Court of Appeals, Deputy Ombudsman (Visayas), and Philippine Ports Authority***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 151121, July 21, 2008 (581 Phil. 9)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Ruben S. Galero, Acting Station Commander, Port Police Division, PPA-PMO
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Deputy Ombudsman (Visayas), Philippine Ports Authority

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the Ombudsman's finding that Petitioner Galero was guilty of Dishonesty, Falsification of Official Documents, and Causing Undue Injury to the Government, warranting dismissal.

**Background:** An anonymous letter alleged that a security guard, Geocadin, was a ghost employee, receiving salary from both Napocor and PPA. Galero, as Geocadin's supervisor, certified Geocadin's DTRs, which were later found to be falsified, indicating Geocadin worked simultaneously for Napocor and PPA. The Ombudsman initially found Galero complicit and ordered his dismissal.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *modified* the Court of Appeals decision. While finding Galero negligent, the Court determined there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove collusion or conspiracy in defrauding the government. Thus, Galero was found *guilty of Simple Neglect of Duty* rather than dishonesty, falsification, and undue injury.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Galero's Duty:** As immediate supervisor, Galero had a duty to verify the truthfulness of employees' DTRs (Civil Service Form No. 48) before certification.
*   **R.A. 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), Sec. 15:** Defines the powers of the Ombudsman, including the authority to direct appropriate action against public officials.
*   **Obligations of Public Servants:** Government employees are obligated to exhibit honesty and dedication to duty. (See citing Concerned Litigants v. Araya)

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Finding (Ombudsman & CA):** Dishonesty, Falsification of Official Documents, Causing Undue Injury to the Government - Warranting Dismissal.
*   **SC Revised Finding:** Simple Neglect of Duty - Warranting Suspension.

*   **Amane v. Atty. Mendoza-Arce (376 Phil. 575 (1999).** Held Branch Clerk of Court, the Presiding Judge and the OIC Philja Director liable because of their acts of tolerating their subordinates' absences

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence of Collusion:** The primary risk to the initial ruling was the lack of concrete evidence linking Galero to a deliberate scheme with Geocadin. This lack of evidence formed the basis for the modification.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Knowledge:** The Ombudsman and CA heavily relied on the presumption that Galero *must* have known about Geocadin's double employment due to his supervisory position. This presumption was weakened by the lack of direct evidence of a collusive agreement.

**Conclusion:** The Court reduced Galero's administrative liability because the initial finding of dishonesty hinged on an unproven conspiracy. Galero was found liable only for failing to adequately verify his subordinate's DTR, constituting simple neglect of duty. This demonstrates the importance of establishing intent and direct involvement when alleging more serious administrative offenses. The penalty was reduced accordingly to a suspension without pay for one month and one day.
