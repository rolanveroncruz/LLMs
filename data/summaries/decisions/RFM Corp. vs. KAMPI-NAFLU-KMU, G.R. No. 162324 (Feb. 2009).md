**Legal Document Summary: RFM Corporation vs. KAMPI-NAFLU-KMU & SUMAPI-NAFLU-KMU (G.R. No. 162324)**

**Case:** RFM Corporation-Flour Division and SFI Feeds Division v. Kasapian ng Manggagawang Pinagkaisa-RFM (KAMPI-NAFLU-KMU) and Sandigan at Ugnayan ng Manggagawang Pinagkaisa-SFI (SUMAPI-NAFLU-KMU)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** February 4, 2009

**Issue:** Whether daily-paid employees are entitled to special holiday pay under a CBA when the holiday falls on a rest day (Sunday). Whether the award of attorney's fees was proper.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling in favor of the respondent unions. Daily-paid employees are entitled to special holiday pay even if the holiday falls on a rest day, based on the clear and unambiguous language of the CBA. The award of attorney's fees was also upheld.

**Key Provisions of CBA (Art. XVI, Sec. 3):**

*   The Company agrees to pay daily paid employees for "Special Holidays with Pay" if declared by the national government, specifically including Black Saturday, November 1, and December 31.
*   Compensation rate is the regular rate. Overtime is paid at the standard ordinary premium.

**Obligations of RFM:**

*   To pay the daily-paid employees their regular rate for December 31, 2000, even though it fell on a Sunday (rest day).

**Liabilities of RFM:**

*   Monetary liability for unpaid holiday pay.
*   Liability for attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Plain Meaning Rule:** The CBA provision is clear and unambiguous, requiring payment for enumerated special holidays regardless of whether they fall on a rest day. _United Kimberly-Clark Employees Union-Philippine Transport General Workers' Organization (UKCEU-PTGWO) v. Kimberly-Clark Philippines, Inc._ supports this interpretation.
*   **Protection of Labor:** Holiday pay is a legislated benefit aimed at protecting workers' income. _Asian Transmission Corp. v. Court of Appeals_ is cited to emphasize that the purpose is to prevent diminution of income due to work interruptions.
*   **CBA as Law:** The CBA is the law between the parties, binding them to its provisions. _TSPIC Corporation v. TSPIC Employees' Union, et al._ is cited.
*   **Interpretation in Favor of Labor:** Any doubt in interpreting labor laws or CBA provisions must be resolved in favor of labor (Article 1702 of the Civil Code; Article 4 of the Labor Code, as cited in _FAMIT v. Court of Appeals_).

**Potential Risks for RFM (and employers generally):**

*   **Strict interpretation of CBA:** Employers must ensure CBA provisions are precisely drafted to reflect the parties' true intentions. Ambiguity will likely be construed against the employer.
*   **Costly litigation:** Failure to comply with CBA provisions can lead to costly litigation and liability for attorney's fees.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **United Kimberly-Clark Employees Union-Philippine Transport General Workers' Organization (UKCEU-PTGWO) v. Kimberly-Clark Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 162957, March 6, 2006:**  Supports the application of the plain meaning rule in interpreting CBAs.
*   **Asian Transmission Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 144664, March 15, 2004, 425 SCRA 478, 484-485:**  Explains the purpose of holiday pay as protecting worker's income.
*   **TSPIC Corporation v. TSPIC Employees' Union, et al., G.R. No. 163419, February 13, 2008, 545 SCRA 215, 225:** Reinforces that CBAs constitute the law between the parties
*   **FAMIT v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 164060, June 15, 2007, 524 SCRA 709, 717:** Highlights the principle of interpreting doubts in favor of labor.
*   **Kimberly Clark Philippines v. Lorredo, G.R. No. 103090, September 21, 1993, 226 SCRA 639:** Distinguished by the CA.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core contentious point revolved around the interpretation of "Special Holidays with Pay" and whether it implicitly excluded holidays falling on rest days. The Court found no ambiguity, however, in the CBA language as written.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code (implied through principles of interpretation)
*   Civil Code (Article 1702, interpreting doubts in favor of labor)
