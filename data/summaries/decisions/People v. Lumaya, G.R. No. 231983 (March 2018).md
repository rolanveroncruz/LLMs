## Legal Document Summary: People v. Crispian Merced Lumaya

**Case:** G.R. No. 231983, March 7, 2018 (827 Phil. 473)

**Parties:** People of the Philippines (Plaintiff-Appellee) v. Crispian Merced Lumaya (Defendant-Appellant) and Derek Joseph Lumaya (Co-Accused)

**Holding:** Crispian Lumaya and Derek Lumaya are acquitted of violations of Sections 5, 11, and 12 of Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) due to breaches in the chain of custody rule.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5, 11, & 12:** Defines and penalizes Illegal Sale, Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, and Illegal Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, respectively.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (pre-RA 10640 amendment):** Outlines the mandatory procedure for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value. Requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items in the presence of the accused, his representative/counsel, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official. Drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Prosecution bears the burden to establish an unbroken chain of custody, accounting for each link from seizure to presentation in court.
*   **Marking:** The first step in chain of custody which requires immediate affixing of the apprehending officer's initials or signature on the dangerous drugs or related items in the presence of the apprehended violator immediately upon arrest.

**Liabilities & Penalties (Reversed):**

*   **Crim. Case No. 21618 (Illegal Sale):** Life imprisonment & P500,000 fine for both Crispian and Derek.
*   **Crim. Case No. 21622 (Illegal Possession):** Life imprisonment & P500,000 fine for Crispian.
*   **Crim. Case No. 21623 (Drug Paraphernalia):** Imprisonment of 6 months and 1 day (min) to 2 years (max) & P10,000 fine for Crispian.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Sachet Count:** A significant discrepancy existed between the number of sachets photographed (18) and the number reflected in the Informations/Inventory Report (11). The prosecution failed to adequately explain this variance, raising serious doubts about the identity and integrity of the seized drugs.
*   **Lack of Paraphernalia Photos:** The absence of photographs of the seized drug paraphernalia called into question whether the items had been lawfully recovered.
*   **Delayed Marking:** Failure to immediately mark the seized items at the scene of the buy-bust or nearest police station violated chain of custody requirements. The Court deemed the provided justification for the delay as insufficient.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5, 11, 12, & 21:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002
*   **RA 10640:** Amendment to RA 9165, while not directly applicable, serves as an informative reference to modern interpretations of chain of custody.
*   **People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010):** Justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 must be proven as a fact.
*   **People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010):** Court cannot presume justifiable grounds for non-compliance.
*   **People v. Ismael, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017:** Defines the first stage in the chain of custody rule, the marking of dangerous drugs or related items, and emphasizes that marking is the affixing on the dangerous drugs or related items by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his initials or signature or other identifying signs, should be made in the presence of the apprehended violator immediately upon arrest.

**Analysis:**

The Court emphasized the mandatory nature of Section 21 of RA 9165 and found the prosecution's failure to adequately explain significant procedural lapses fatally compromised the chain of custody. The discrepancy in sachet count, lack of photographic evidence of paraphernalia, and delayed marking all contributed to reasonable doubt regarding the integrity and identity of the seized evidence. As a result, the Court overturned the CA decision and acquitted Crispian and Derek Lumaya.
