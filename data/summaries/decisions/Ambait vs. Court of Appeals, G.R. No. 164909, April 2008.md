*   **Factual Basis:** Police officers, acting on a tip, conducted an entrapment operation related to illegal gambling.  While on the premises, officers noticed a bulge in Ambait's pocket, leading to the discovery of shabu and an unlicensed .38 caliber revolver with ammunition during a frisk.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Warrantless Search & Seizure:**  The central legal issue revolves around the legality of the warrantless search and seizure. The Court upheld it under two exceptions: plain view and as incident to lawful arrest.  Argue that police did not have legal right to be there.
*   **Inconsistent Testimony:** The defense argued inconsistencies in witness testimonies. The Court deemed these "minor" and not affecting credibility.
*   **Application of R.A. 8294:**  The defense argued for exoneration on the illegal firearms charge based on R.A. 8294.  The Supreme Court did not address this, implying its inapplicability, possibly because the firearm was already in illegal possession when they entered the house.
