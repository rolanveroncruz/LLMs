**Case Summary: *Abadilla, et al. v. PAGCOR*** (G.R. No. 258658, June 19, 2024)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging a Court of Appeals decision regarding the employment status of petitioners (Abadilla, et al.) at PAGCOR.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Employment Status:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's ruling that the petitioners were not regular employees, but rather *contract of service* or *job order* workers.
*   **PAGCOR's Authority:**  PAGCOR, a GOCC created by Presidential Decree No. 1869 (PAGCOR Charter), as amended by Republic Act No. 9487, has the power to hire both regular employees and contract of service/job order workers.  While Section 16 of the PAGCOR Charter initially exempted all positions from Civil Service Law, this exemption has been modified by the 1987 Constitution and Executive Order No. 292.
*   **Not Confidential Employees:** The SC agreed with the petitioners that they were not confidential employees, due to the nature of their functions, their organizational ranking, and their compensation level. Referencing *Civil Service Commission and Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v. Salas* and *Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v. Rilloraza*, confidential employee designations aren't absolutely binding and are subject to judicial review.
*   **Application of CSC Rules:** The SC applied CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series of 1998, CSC Resolution No. 020790, and CSC, COA, and DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017, which govern contract of service/job order employment. The services are not considered government service and are not subject to civil service laws. Petitioners' contracts complied with CSC guidelines for these types of workers.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PAGCOR's Obligations:** While the case was decided in PAGCOR's favor regarding the workers' status, the SC reminded PAGCOR that its authority to contract services should not be used to mistreat or mismanage such workers. This implies a potential for administrative or legal action if PAGCOR engages in exploitative practices regarding its contract of service or job order workers.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Exploitation of Contractual Workers:** While this case establishes that these workers are not covered by Civil Service laws, there is potential legal risk if PAGCOR's actions towards such workers violate labor laws.
*   **Misclassification:**  The SC emphasized the importance of properly classifying employees based on the nature of their work. Misclassification of employees as contract of service or job order workers when they are actually performing functions of regular employees could lead to future legal challenges.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1869 (PAGCOR Charter), as amended by Republic Act No. 9487:** Defines PAGCOR's powers and structure.
*   **Executive Order No. 292 (Administrative Code of 1987):** Relevant regarding Civil Service Law application.
*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 40, series of 1998:** Guidelines for contracts of service and job orders.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 020790:** Details provisions that *cannot* be included in contracts of service or job orders.
*   **CSC, COA, and DBM Joint Circular No. 1, series of 2017:** Clarifies the status of contract of service and job order workers.
*   ***Civil Service Commission and Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v. Salas***:  Addresses the application of Section 16 of the PAGCOR Charter.
*   ***Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v. Rilloraza***: Further clarifies the application of Section 16 and the determination of confidential employees.

**Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Section 16, PAGCOR Charter:** The interpretation of this section regarding exemption from Civil Service Laws has been a source of contention and judicial clarification.
*   **"Regular Function" vs. Contractual Service:** The line between performing a "regular function" (characteristic of a regular employee) and providing contractual services can be a point of dispute.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Focus on Actual Work Performed:** In similar future cases, focus on proving that the work performed by the individuals in fact corresponded to the work of a regular employee despite the contract's designation.
*   **Due Process for Job Order Workers:** Ensure that even job order workers are treated fairly and afforded due process in any termination procedures, to mitigate potential future claims of labor abuse or unfairness.
