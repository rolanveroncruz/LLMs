## Legal Document Summary: Travelaire & Tours Corp. v. NLRC (G.R. No. 131523)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari assailing the NLRC decision awarding separation pay to Nenita Medelyn, a former chief accountant who voluntarily resigned from Travelaire & Tours Corp.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Employee's Claim:** Medelyn argued she's entitled to separation pay due to company practice of granting it to resigning employees.
*   **Employer's Defense:** Travelaire denied a formal policy, claiming payments to prior resigning employees were ex gratia and not separation pay.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** The NLRC found a company policy based on past payments to three resigning employees (Abendan, Cabate, and Loya), despite being labelled "ex gratia" in some instances. It also noted the lack of discriminatory reason for denying separation pay to Medelyn.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:** The NLRC ordered Travelaire to pay Medelyn separation pay in the amount of P55,400.00, based on the perceived company policy.
*   **Liability Basis:** Liability is based on a finding of established company practice, even without a written agreement or CBA provision.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Company Practice" Definition:** The crux of the case rests on defining "company practice." The court accepted three instances as sufficient to establish a practice, raising the risk of similar claims from future resigning employees. There is ambiguity in the sufficiency of evidence for establishing a "company practice."
*   **"Ex Gratia" vs. Separation Pay:** The distinction between "ex gratia" payments and actual separation pay is blurred. The court essentially disregarded the label, focusing on the fact that payments were made upon separation.
*   **Evidence Burden:** The burden shifted to the employer to disprove the "company practice." Failure to provide countervailing evidence (e.g., records of resigned employees not receiving separation pay) was detrimental to Travelaire's case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **General Rule on Separation Pay:** The court reiterates the general rule that voluntarily resigning employees are *not* entitled to separation pay unless stipulated in a contract/CBA or based on established company practice (CJC Trading, Inc. v. NLRC, 248 SCRA 724 (1995)).
*   **Substantial Evidence:** The NLRC's decision was upheld because it was supported by substantial evidence (Eduardo B. Prangan v. NLRC, G.R. 126529, April 15, 1998). Substantial evidence is defined as such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.
*   **Certiorari Review Standard:** The court's review is limited to grave abuse of discretion (Ilocus Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. NLRC, 241 SCRA 36, 50 (1995); PMI Colleges v. NLRC, G.R. No. 121466, August 15, 1997).
*   **Pro-Labor Stance:** The decision invokes the pro-labor principle of resolving doubts in favor of the employee (Prangan v. NLRC, supra; Sarmiento v. Employees Compensation Commission, 144 SCRA 422 (1986)).

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The court's reliance on only three instances of separation pay to establish a "company practice" seems lenient. The frequency, consistency, and explicitness of a stated policy are typically relevant.
*   The decision doesn't adequately address the employer's argument that the payments were acts of generosity, potentially disincentivizing employers from making *any* discretionary payments to departing employees for fear of establishing a binding precedent.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** High risk for employers with even a few instances of discretionary separation-related payments, especially if documentation is unclear.
