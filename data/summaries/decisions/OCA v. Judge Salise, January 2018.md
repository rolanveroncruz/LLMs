**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-18-2514**

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Judge Hector B. Salise.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Multiple Procedural Lapses:** The judicial audit revealed numerous instances of procedural violations across both Branch 6 and Branch 7 of the RTC.
*   **Nullity of Marriage Cases:**
    *   Violations of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages) specifically Section 6, by allowing substituted service of summons improperly.
    *   Premature decisions, proceeding without jurisdiction, lack of mandatory investigation reports, and failure to conduct mandatory pre-trial.
*   **Criminal Cases:**
    *   Granting bail in capital offense cases without mandatory bail hearings (violation of Rule 114, Sections 7 & 8).
    *   Dismissing criminal cases before arraignment or scheduled hearings and based on fabricated grounds.
    *   Improper plea bargaining in drug cases (R.A. 9165 violations, specifically Section 23, Art. II, though subsequent case law *Estipona v. Judge Lobrigo, G.R. No. 226679* changes interpretation).
    *   Delayed issuance of arrest warrants (Rule 112, Section 6 violations).
*   **Delegation of Authority:** Improper delegation of reception of evidence to a non-lawyer clerk of court (violation of Section 9, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court).

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Judge Salise failed to uphold the integrity and dignity of the judiciary by violating established procedural rules and statutes. He had a duty to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice. Canon 3, Section 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct violated.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court found Judge Salise GUILTY of **serious misconduct.**
*   He was **DISMISSED from service**, with forfeiture of retirement benefits (except leave credits), and barred from re-employment in any government branch or instrumentality.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Good Faith" Defense:** Judge Salise's defense of "good faith" and inadvertence was rejected by the Court, which found a pattern of misdeeds.
*   **Subjectivity in "Serious Misconduct":** While misconduct must be "grave, serious, important" etc., the court held the elements of "corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest" to rise to the level of "gross misconduct" to warrant dismissal.
*   **Application of *Estipona v. Judge Lobrigo***: While the Court cites the prohibition of plea-bargaining in drug cases under the old interpretation of R.A. 9165 Sec 23, the subsequent *Estipona* ruling (G.R. No. 226679) changes the landscape. However, this is likely a moot point as the overall pattern of misconduct provided sufficient grounds for dismissal.
*   **Discretion in Forfeiture:** The Court retains discretion in determining what part of the benefits will be forfeited beyond accrued leave credits.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC (Rule on Declaration of Nullity of Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages).

**Conclusion:** The document details a serious case of judicial misconduct, leading to the dismissal of Judge Salise. The primary issues revolve around violations of procedural rules and a pattern of irregular case handling. The Judge's defense of "good faith" did not prevail given the extent and nature of the violations.
