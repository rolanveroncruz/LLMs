**Legal Document Summary: People vs. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision reversing the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the RTC's conviction of Basher Tomawis for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of illegal drugs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:**  Criminalizes the sale, trading, etc., of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (pre-RA 10640 amendment):**  Outlines the mandatory procedure for seizure, initial custody, and handling of confiscated drugs. Emphasizes immediate inventory and photographing at the place of seizure, presence of the accused (or representative), media representative, DOJ representative, and an elected public official.
*   **IRR of RA 9165, Section 21(a):**  Clarifies alternative locations for inventory and photographing if immediate conduct is impracticable (nearest police station or apprehending officer's office). Includes a saving clause for non-compliance under justifiable grounds, provided integrity and evidentiary value are preserved.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Apprehending Team's Obligation:** Strict compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 to establish the *corpus delicti* and the chain of custody. Failure leads to reasonable doubt and potential acquittal. The obligation falls on the Prosecution to prove compliance with the required procedure.
*   **Prosecution's Burden:**  Prove beyond reasonable doubt the identities of the buyer, seller, object, and consideration, the delivery of the thing sold, and that the integrity and identity of the seized drug (the *corpus delicti*) were preserved.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Strict Compliance vs. Saving Clause:**  The document highlights the tension between strict adherence to Section 21 and the allowance for deviation under justifiable circumstances. The prosecution must justify any deviation and demonstrate preservation of integrity and evidentiary value. The court notes, in this instance, the justification was not sufficient.
*   **"Immediately After Seizure and Confiscation":**  The interpretation of this phrase as requiring the presence of the three required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official) *at* the time of the arrest and seizure is a potential point of contention.
*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:**  Unclear transfers of custody between officers, lack of testimony regarding handling from the PDEA office to the laboratory to the court.
*   **Inconsistencies in Descriptions:** The discrepancies in the description of the seized drugs (knot tied plastic vs a maroon pouch) create doubt as to the identity of the recovered item.
*   **Reliance on Presumption of Regularity:**  The document criticizes the lower courts' reliance on the presumption of regularity in performance of official duty when there are clear procedural lapses.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5 and Section 21:** Central statutes to the case.
*   **RA 10640:**  Amendment to RA 9165 (not applicable in this case due to the date of the offense).
*   **People v. Pagaura, People v. Salangga:** Standards for reasonable doubt in criminal cases
*   **People v. Mendoza, Gamboa v. People, People v. Umipang, People v. Cayas, People v. Alviz, Mallillin v. People, People v. Enriquez:**  Jurisprudence related to the requirements of Section 21, chain of custody, and the presumption of regularity in drug cases.
*   **People v. Jugo:**  The Prosecutors' Duty to prove compliance with procedure set forth in Section 21.
*   **People v. Go, People v. Aminnudin:** Law Enforcement and the Protection of Individual Liberty

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The core issue revolves around the buy-bust team's failure to comply with the "three-witness rule" stipulated in Section 21 of RA 9165 and the failure to establish a clear and unbroken chain of custody for the seized drugs.
*   The prosecution's attempt to invoke the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties is rejected due to the numerous procedural lapses.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to the prosecution's failure to prove compliance with the mandatory requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 and the broken chain of custody. The Court emphasized that the prosecution's failure to establish each step in the handling of the seized drugs from seizure to presentation as evidence cast reasonable doubt on the *corpus delicti*, warranting acquittal. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in drug cases to protect individual liberties and the integrity of the evidence.
