## Legal Document Summary: *Manuel Go Cinco vs. Court of Appeals, Ester Servacio, and Maasin Traders Lending Corporation* (G.R. No. 151903, October 9, 2009)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on *certiorari* involving a dispute over a real estate mortgage. Petitioners (spouses Go Cinco) secured a loan from Respondent MTLC, mortgaging their property. They later obtained a second loan from PNB to pay off MTLC. A Special Power of Attorney (SPA) was executed authorizing Respondent Servacio (MTLC President) to collect PNB loan proceeds. Servacio refused to sign a release of mortgage required by PNB, preventing payment. The core issue is whether this refusal constituted payment extinguishing the MTLC debt.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Initial loan of P700,000.00 from MTLC to Manuel Cinco at 3% monthly interest (36% per annum), secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   **PNB Loan:** Approved P1.3M loan from PNB, intended to settle MTLC debt, secured by the same property.
*   **SPA:** Special Power of Attorney granted to Ester Servacio (MTLC President), authorizing her to collect PNB loan proceeds.
*   **Release of Mortgage:** PNB required Servacio to sign a release/cancellation of MTLC mortgage before releasing loan proceeds.

**Liabilities:**

*   **RTC Ruling:** Initially favored spouses Go Cinco, awarding significant damages for abuse of rights, including lost interest savings, unrealized profits, moral and exemplary damages, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees.
*   **CA Reversal:** Reversed RTC, holding that the MTLC loan remained unpaid due to the absence of an explicit agreement for mortgage cancellation and application of PNB loan proceeds. The Court of Appeals found that Ester Servacio was merely authorized to withdraw the proceeds of the loan.
*   **SC Ruling:** Ultimately finds that Respondent Servacio's refusal to accept payment was without justifiable basis, but held that such refusal does not constitute payment. The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and partly reinstated the RTC decision with modifications.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Explicit Agreement:** The CA highlighted the absence of a clear agreement regarding the cancellation of the MTLC mortgage as a condition for the release of PNB funds. This was a significant point of contention and the basis for their reversal.
*   **Interpretation of SPA:** Differing interpretations of the SPA's scope. The CA interpreted it narrowly as simply authorizing collection, while the petitioners argued it impliedly authorized application of funds to the MTLC loan. The Supreme Court recognized the implied authority to apply the proceeds to the MTLC loan.
*   **Refusal to Accept Payment:** The unjustified refusal to accept payment, while not constituting payment itself, triggered potential liability for damages and suspension of interest accrual, as per Article 1256 of the Civil Code regarding tender of payment and consignation. *Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Diaz Realty, Inc.*, 416 Phil. 147 (2001)
*   **Damages:** The amounts and basis for damages awarded were challenged. The Supreme Court deleted awards for loss of savings and unrealized profits due to lack of factual basis and speculative nature, but upheld reduced moral damages and exemplary damages.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 1231 (Modes of Extinguishing Obligations), 1232, 1233, 1235, 1236, 1238, 1244, 1248 (Payment), 1256 (Tender of Payment and Consignation), 2130 (Void Stipulation Prohibiting Alienation), 19 (Abuse of Rights), 2220, 2232 (Damages).

*   *Lucas v. Spouses Royo* 398 Phil. 400 (2000)(Actual Damages)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the scope of the SPA and whether it encompassed the authority to apply PNB loan proceeds to the MTLC loan.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that while the spouses Go Cinco failed to effectuate valid payment through tender and consignation, the unjust refusal of Servacio to accept payment entitled them to relief.  The Court directed MTLC to accept the PNB loan proceeds (if still available) and release the mortgage. The decision highlights the creditor's duty to act in good faith and avoid abusing their rights, while also reinforcing the legal requirements for valid tender of payment and consignation.
