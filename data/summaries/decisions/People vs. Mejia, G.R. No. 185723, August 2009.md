## Legal Document Summary - People v. Mejia, G.R. No. 185723 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Edwin Mejia for Rape (Art. 266-A, RPC) and Acts of Lasciviousness (Art. 336, RPC) against his stepdaughter.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Rape (Crim. Case No. SCC-4081):**  The Supreme Court affirms the CA decision finding Mejia guilty of simple rape. The elements of carnal knowledge through force and intimidation were established by the victim's testimony.
*   **Acts of Lasciviousness (Crim. Case No. SCC-4080):** The SC affirms the conviction for Acts of Lasciviousness as carnal knowledge was not proven. Elements of Art. 336 were satisfied: lewd act (laying on top of victim) + force/intimidation.
*   **Alibi Defense:**  The alibi defense (accused was harvesting mangoes) failed.  It was not physically impossible for the accused to be at the crime scene.
*   **Victim's Credibility:** The victim's testimony was deemed credible despite minor inconsistencies. The Court gives weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Qualifying Circumstances:** The Court of Appeals correctly disregarded the qualifying circumstance of minority (victim under 18) for the Rape charge. Although proven, it was not alleged in the Information, as required by Secs. 8 & 9, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure and applicable case law (e.g., *People v. Tabanggay*). For the qualifying circumstance under Art. 266-B(1) to apply (parent/stepparent relation and minority) both must be alleged and proven.
*   **Damages:** P50,000 civil indemnity and P50,000 moral damages were correctly awarded for Rape. P30,000 in moral damages was awarded for Acts of Lasciviousness. Exemplary damages were denied due to the absence of proven aggravating circumstances.
*   **Denial Defense:** The Court considered the denial defense weak.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:**  To serve the sentences for Rape (Reclusion Perpetua) and Acts of Lasciviousness (indeterminate penalty of 6 months *arresto mayor* to 3 years *prision correccional*).
*   **Accused:** To pay indemnity and damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**  Conviction for Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness.
*   **Civil Liability:**  Obligation to pay civil indemnity and moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Minority Allegation:**  The case highlights the importance of properly pleading all qualifying circumstances in the Information.  Failure to do so can prevent the imposition of a higher penalty, even if the circumstances are proven at trial. The absence of independent proof, such as a birth certificate, proving the victim's age at the time of the crime further weakens the prosecution's case for a higher penalty.
*   **Defense Strategy:** The defense focused on undermining the victim's credibility, arguing that she fabricated the charges out of hatred.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** The alibi defense was weak due to the short travel time between the alibi location and the crime scene.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 266-A, Revised Penal Code (Rape)**
*   **Art. 336, Revised Penal Code (Acts of Lasciviousness)**
*   **Art. 266-B, Revised Penal Code (Qualifying Circumstances for Rape)**
*   **Secs. 8 & 9, Rule 110, Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure (Pleading of Qualifying/Aggravating Circumstances)**
*   **People v. Tabanggay, 390 Phil. 67 (2000) (Re: proof of qualifying circumstances)**

**Summary Judgment:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' conviction for rape, but found the CA should have only sentenced for simple rape due to the failure to include the victims minority in the indictment.
