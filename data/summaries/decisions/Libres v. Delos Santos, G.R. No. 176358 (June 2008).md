**Case Summary: *Libres v. Delos Santos*, G.R. No. 176358 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of a foreclosure suit.

**Facts:** Spouses Delos Santos (Respondents) filed a complaint for foreclosure of mortgage against Bienvenido Libres and Julie Paningbatan (Petitioners) based on three Real Estate Mortgages allegedly executed by Libres to secure loans totaling P150,000. Petitioners denied the loans and the authenticity of Libres' signatures, claiming forgery. The RTC initially dismissed the case, favoring the NBI handwriting expert's opinion. The CA reversed, giving weight to the notarized mortgage deeds and testimonies of the notaries public.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Three separate mortgages securing loans totaling P150,000. Failure to pay triggers foreclosure.
*   **Loan Obligation:** Petitioners alleged to have borrowed P150,000 from Respondents.
*   **Interest:** CA ordered payment with legal interest at 12% per annum from August 18, 1995.
*   **Foreclosure:** If Petitioners fail to pay within 90 days, the mortgaged property will be sold at public auction.
*   **Family Home Determination:** RTC to determine if property is a family home under the Family Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Bienvenido Libres and Julie Paningbatan:** Jointly liable for the P150,000 debt plus interest.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Forgery Claim:** The core issue revolves around the authenticity of Libres' signatures. While the SC ruled against petitioners, the NBI expert testimony creates a lingering risk, especially if further evidence of forgery surfaces.
*   **Family Home Status:** If the property is determined to be a family home, foreclosure may be subject to limitations and protections under Articles 152-162 of the Family Code. The inquiry into the nature, circumstances and value of the same could lead to complications and delay the execution.
*   **Usury:** While not explicitly raised, the 12% legal interest should be reviewed for potential usury issues given the historical context of the loans.
*   **Agency:** No clear documentation exists surrounding the alleged authority of Julie Paningbatan, creating a risk that the transactions were not duly authorized.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Domingo v. Domingo, G.R. No. 150897 (2005):** Emphasizes the presumption of regularity of notarized documents and the high burden of proof to overcome them.
*   **Jimenez v. Commission on Ecumenical Mission and Relations, G.R. No. 140472 (2002):** Clarifies that handwriting expert testimony is not mandatory and is merely persuasive.
*   **Pan Pacific Industrial Sales Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125283 (2006):** Further reinforces the presumption of regularity of notarial documents.
*   **Leyva v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 71939 (1988):** Posits that positive testimony of attesting witnesses outweigh expert opinions, which is also subject to inherent infirmities.
*   **Heirs of Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 117609 (1998):** States forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved by clear, positive and convincing evidence

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 68:** Governs the procedure for foreclosure of mortgage.
*   **Family Code, Articles 152-162:** Governs the concept of the family home and its protection from forced sale.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The entire agreement is contentious due to the forgery allegations. No specific clauses stand out beyond the general terms.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the mortgages based on the presumption of regularity of notarized documents and the failure of Petitioners to convincingly prove forgery. The key risk lies in the determination of whether the property constitutes a family home, which could significantly impact the execution of the foreclosure. Further investigation should be undertaken to confirm the family home status and to explore any potential defenses related to usury or lack of proper agency.
