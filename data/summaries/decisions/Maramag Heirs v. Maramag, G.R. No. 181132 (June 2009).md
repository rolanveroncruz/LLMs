## Legal Document Summary - *Heirs of Maramag v. Maramag et al.* G.R. No. 181132

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Summary:** The Heirs of Loreto Maramag (petitioners), his legitimate wife and children, sued Eva Verna De Guzman Maramag (Loreto's concubine) and her illegitimate children with Loreto, along with Insular Life Assurance Company, Ltd. and Great Pacific Life Assurance Corporation, seeking revocation and/or reduction of life insurance proceeds paid to the illegitimate family.  The Petitioners argued that Eva was disqualified as a beneficiary due to her being a concubine and possibly involved in Loreto's death, and that the illegitimate children were receiving more than their rightful legitime.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Insurance Code, Sec. 53:** Overrides Civil Code re: distribution of proceeds. Proceeds go to named beneficiaries (Insular and Grepalife's main defense).
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2011:** Insurance contracts governed by special laws (Insurance Code primarily).
*   **Civil Code, Art. 739 (Donations):** Prohibition against donations between persons guilty of adultery or concubinage. Initially cited by the RTC in favor of the petitioners as invalidating Eva's designation; however, this was later overturned.
*   **Insurance Code, Sec. 12:** Forfeiture of beneficiary interest if the beneficiary willfully causes the death of the insured. This was alluded to by the Petitioners but not proven.

**Liabilities:**

*   Insurers (Insular & Grepalife): Initially potentially liable to legitimate heirs if Eva remained a beneficiary. This was negated when the illegitimate children remained as valid beneficiaries.
*   Eva Verna De Guzman Maramag: If still a designated beneficiary, could have been liable to return proceeds to legitimate heirs due to concubinage disqualification under Art. 739 of the Civil Code, or to the insurers if disqualified as such under the Insurance Code.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Designation of Beneficiaries:** The validity of the designation of the illegitimate children as beneficiaries was crucial. The Court found this designation valid.
*   **Application of Civil Code vs. Insurance Code:** The petitioners' reliance on Civil Code provisions regarding legitimes and donations was ultimately unsuccessful due to the primacy of the Insurance Code (Sec. 53).
*   **Disqualification under Art. 739:** While the Court acknowledges Art. 739, its effect was nullified because only children remained.
*   **Section 12 of the Insurance Code:** The Petitioners touched on the forfeiture of benefits if Eva brought about the death of Loreto, although the Court did not explore this because it was not proven.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Insurance Code, Sec. 53 & 12**
*   **Civil Code, Art. 2011 & 739**
*   *Enriquez v. Sun Life Assurance Co., 41 Phil. 269* (Insurance Code prevails over Civil Code)
*   *Grecio v. Sunlife Assurance Co. of Canada, 48 Phil. 63* (Beneficiary has a vested right)
*   *Del Val v. Del Val, 29 Phil. 534* (Insurance indemnity not an advance of inheritance)
*   *Southern Luzon Employees' Association v. Juanita Golpeo, et al* (Proceeds belong to beneficiary)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The initial ruling of the RTC focused on whether the donation made through insurance beneficiaries were considered excessive. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the consideration of this argument.
*   The claim that the illegitimate children were only entitled to half of the legitime.
*   The claim that Eva's potential involvement in Loreto's death would cause the proceeds to be forfeited in favor of the Petitioners.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the CA's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction (pure question of law). The insurance proceeds are to be distributed to the designated beneficiaries (the illegitimate children) as per Section 53 of the Insurance Code.

**Legal Implication:** This case reinforces the principle that insurance proceeds are primarily governed by the Insurance Code, and that legitimate heirs have no claim to the proceeds if other beneficiaries are validly designated. This document highlights the importance of carefully designating beneficiaries and understanding the limitations of succession law in the context of insurance contracts.
