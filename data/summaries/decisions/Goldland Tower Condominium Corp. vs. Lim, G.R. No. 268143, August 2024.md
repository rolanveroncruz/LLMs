## Legal Document Summary: *Goldland Tower Condominium Corporation vs. Edward L. Lim and Hsieh Hsiu-Ping*

**Case:** *Goldland Tower Condominium Corporation vs. Edward L. Lim and Hsieh Hsiu-Ping*, G.R. No. 268143, August 12, 2024

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of a judicial foreclosure action.

**Key Issue:** Whether a prior extrajudicial demand is required for a judicial foreclosure action based on unpaid condominium association dues.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, holding that the filing of a judicial foreclosure action itself constitutes sufficient demand, and prior extrajudicial demand is not required.

**Facts:**

*   Hsieh, the original owner, failed to pay condominium association dues to Goldland, resulting in a lien annotated on the CCT.
*   Lim purchased the property at a tax delinquency sale.
*   Goldland filed a judicial foreclosure action against Lim and Hsieh to recover unpaid dues.
*   Lim argued lack of prior demand and the superiority of the tax lien.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Goldland, finding Lim liable for the dues as a prior lien.
*   CA reversed, holding that the action was premature due to lack of prior demand on Lim.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Goldland's Argument:** The annotated lien on the CCT served as constructive notice to Lim, constituting sufficient demand.

*   **Lim's Argument:** Lack of prior extrajudicial demand renders the foreclosure action premature; tax lien is superior.

*   **CA Holding (Reversed):** Prior extrajudicial demand on Lim was required for a valid foreclosure; the filing of the suit was premature.

*   **SC Ruling:**

    *   Distinguishes between "demand" and "notice." Notice (constructive or actual) pertains to knowledge and good faith; demand requires proof of service and receipt.

    *   While constructive notice through annotation on the CCT resulted in Lim assuming Hsieh's obligation, it doesn't substitute for actual demand on Lim.

    *   Crucially, the filing of the judicial foreclosure action itself constitutes sufficient demand.

    *   Cites Article 1169 of the Civil Code: Extrajudicial demand isn't always necessary for judicial action. Absent stipulation, judicial demand (filing suit) is sufficient to put debtor in default.

    *   Legal interest accrues from date of judicial demand (filing of the suit).

    *   Condominium Act allows for judicial foreclosure for unpaid assessments.

    *   RTC Correctly Allowed Foreclosure: Court ordered Lim to pay the amount of PHP 4,362,208.14, plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum computed from finality of the decision until full payment. Also, in case of failure to pay the amount within the time prescribed, the petitioner shall proceed with the sale of the condominium unit through public auction and disposition of the proceeds in accordance with law.

**Relevant Laws and Case Law:**

*   **Article 1169 of the Civil Code:** Defines when a debtor incurs delay and the necessity of demand.
*   **Article 2087 of the Civil Code:** Concerns the alienation of mortgaged property when the principal obligation is due.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (The Property Registration Decree), Section 59:** Carry-over of encumbrances.
*   **Republic Act No. 4726 (The Condominium Act), Section 20:** Provides the right of the management body of condominiums to implement liens in case of failure to pay association dues.
*   **Rule 68 of the Rules of Court:** Governs judicial foreclosure of mortgages.
*   ***BIR v. TICO Insurance Co., Inc.*, G.R. No. 204226, April 18, 2022:** Priority of lien established by prior annotation.
*   ***Pineda v. De Vega*, 851 Phil. 1106 (2019):** Reiterates that the filing of a complaint constitutes judicial demand.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   None apparent. The court's ruling appears decisive and well-reasoned, clarifying the distinction between notice and demand in the context of foreclosure actions. The decision could be seen to simplify foreclosure procedure by removing the perceived need for a preliminary extrajudicial demand. However, it could be argued that the ruling does not apply if the debt is not yet due.
