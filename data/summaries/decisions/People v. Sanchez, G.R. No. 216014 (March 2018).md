**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sanchez***

**Document:** Resolution in G.R. No. 216014, *People of the Philippines v. Edwin Sanchez y Salvo A.K.A. "Dada"*, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision upholding Sanchez's conviction for illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs (methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu") under Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5 (Illegal Sale):** Prohibits the unauthorized sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) identities of buyer and seller, object, and consideration; and (2) delivery of the thing sold and payment.
*   **Section 11 (Illegal Possession):** Prohibits the unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (1) actual possession of a prohibited drug; (2) possession unauthorized by law; and (3) free and conscious possession.
*   **Section 21 (Chain of Custody):** Defines the required procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs. Specifies that the apprehending team must immediately physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.The item needs to be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a qualitative and quantitative examination. A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   **Illegal Sale:** Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. (per RTC decision)
*   **Illegal Possession:** Indeterminate imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 15 years and 1 day, and a fine of P300,000.00. (per RTC decision)

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The defense argued a break in the chain of custody due to inconsistencies in the testimonies of IO1 Diocampo and IO1 Riñopa regarding where the seized items were marked. IO1 Diocampo testified that the sachets were marked at the barangay hall, while IO1 Riñopa recalled marking the sachets at the place of the arrest. The Court dismissed this as a minor inconsistency that did not affect the integrity of the evidence. *Potential risk*:  While the court found sufficient compliance, future challenges could focus on stricter interpretation of the chain of custody rule, potentially citing case law emphasizing meticulous adherence to Section 21 of R.A. 9165 (pre-amendment by R.A. 10640). Any deviation from the strict requirements of inventory, photographing, and presence of required witnesses at the time of seizure and marking can be grounds for acquittal.
*   **Defense of Denial/Frame-Up:** The accused claimed denial and frame-up, but failed to present corroborating witnesses (e.g., those he was allegedly drinking with at the time of arrest) or provide evidence of ill motive on the part of the apprehending officers. *Potential risk*: These defenses are weak without supporting evidence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 and 11 establish the crimes of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, respectively.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 (Pre-Amendment by R.A. 10640):** The applicable chain of custody rule at the time of the offense.
*   **People v. Dilao, 555 Phil. 394, 409 (2007):** Cited for the elements of the crime of selling dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Lagman, 593 Phil. 617, 625 (2008):** Cited for the elements of the crime of possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Cruz, 667 Phil. 420 (2011):** Cited by the RTC to prove the elements of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Castro, 667 Phil. 526 (2011):** Cited by the RTC to prove the elements of the crime of possession of dangerous drugs.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The differing testimonies regarding the marking of seized items presents a possible ambiguity. However, the Court considered this inconsistency minor and deemed the chain of custody adequately established.

**Overall Assessment:**

The prosecution successfully established the elements of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. The defenses raised were weak and unsupported by evidence. While there was an inconsistency regarding the location of the marking, the Court determined this did not compromise the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items. The decision is likely to be upheld if further appealed, given the established facts and applicable jurisprudence.
