**Case Summary: *Miguel Draculan Escobar v. People* & *Reynaldo F. Constantino v. Sandiganbayan***

**Citation:** G.R. Nos. 228349 and 228353; G.R. Nos. 229895-96, September 19, 2018

**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division (Tijam, J.)

**Issue:** Whether the Sandiganbayan erred in finding that the delay in filing the Informations against Petitioners Escobar and Constantino was not inordinate and did not violate their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petitions, ANULLED the Sandiganbayan Resolutions denying the motions to dismiss, and ORDERED the Sandiganbayan to DISMISS the criminal cases (SB-12-CRM-0129 and SB-12-CRM-0130) against Petitioners based on a violation of their constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusations:** Escobar and Constantino (former government officials) were accused of Malversation through Falsification of Public Documents and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) related to alleged misuse of government funds via dummy organizations.

*   **Timeline of Delay:**
    *   Complaints filed with OMB-Mindanao in 2003 (CPL-M-03-0163 and CPL-M-03-0729).
    *   Resolution finding probable cause against Escobar: August 11, 2004.
    *   Resolution finding probable cause against Constantino: April 15, 2005.
    *   Memorandum approving recommendations to file Informations: August 8, 2011.
    *   Informations filed with Sandiganbayan: May 7, 2012.
    *   Total delay from finding probable cause to filing Information: 7 years, 8 months, 26 days (Escobar); 7 years, 22 days (Constantino).

*   **Petitioner's Arguments:** Escobar and Constantino filed motions to dismiss arguing violation of their right to speedy disposition of cases. They argued the piecemeal filing of informations, and delay, violated their constitutional rights to due process and speedy disposition of cases.

*   **Sandiganbayan Rulings:** Denied the motions to dismiss, citing limited prosecution resources, case volume, and investigation into fictitious check encashers.

*   **Supreme Court Reasoning:**
    *   **Length of Delay:** Found the delays of over 7 years from finding probable cause to filing Informations to be inordinate.
    *   **Reasons for Delay:** Rejected the Sandiganbayan's justifications as insufficient and unsupported by evidence. No adequate justification presented for the long period to resolve the preliminary investigation.
    *   **Invocation of Right:** Petitioners invoked their right to speedy disposition immediately after the Informations were filed.  The court noted that the burden is on the prosecution to expedite the case.  *Cervantes v. Sandiganbayan*, 366 Phil. 602 (1999), and *Coscolluela v. Sandiganbayan, et al.*, 714 Phil. 55 (2013).
    *   **Prejudice:** The delay prejudiced the petitioners' ability to adequately prepare their defense and risked the impairment of witness memories.

*   **Case Law Cited:**
    *   *Tatad v. Sandiganbayan*, 242 Phil. 563 (1988) (3-year delay).
    *   *Lopez, Jr. v. Office of the Ombudsman*, 417 Phil. 39 (2001) (4-year delay).
    *   *People v. Sandiganbayan, et al.*, 723 Phil. 444 (2013) (5+ year delay).
    *   *Roque v. Office of the Ombudsman*, 366 Phil. 568 (1999) (6-year delay).
    *   *Inocentes v. People, et al.*, 789 Phil. 318 (2016) (7-year delay).
    *   *Capt. Roquero v. The Chancellor of UP-Manila, et al.*, 628 Phil. 628 (2010).

**Obligations:** The Ombudsman has a constitutional obligation to act promptly on complaints. The State has the duty to bring a defendant to trial and ensure consistency with due process.

**Liabilities:** The Ombudsman's failure to act promptly resulted in the dismissal of the cases against the Petitioners.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The determination of what constitutes an "inordinate delay" remains fact-specific. The Court relies on precedents to guide the determination of inordinate delay.
*   **Justification of Delay:**  The acceptance of justifications for delay (e.g., limited resources, complex investigations) is scrutinized, and the prosecution bears the burden to adequately demonstrate and prove the validity and necessity of the delays.
*   **Impact:** This ruling underscores the importance of timely action by the Ombudsman and could lead to the dismissal of other cases where similar delays are evident.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article III, Section 16, 1987 Philippine Constitution (right to speedy disposition of cases)
*   Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act)
*   Article XI, Section 12, 1987 Philippine Constitution (Ombudsman duties)

**Summary for a Lawyer:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Sandiganbayan, holding that the Ombudsman violated the Petitioners' constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases by taking over 7 years from finding probable cause to filing Informations for Malversation and violation of RA 3019. The Court deemed the delay inordinate, rejecting the prosecution's justifications and citing precedent involving similar delays. This case reinforces the Ombudsman's constitutional mandate to act promptly and highlights the risk of dismissal for protracted delays in preliminary investigations, particularly where demonstrable prejudice to the accused exists. Focus on the burden on the prosecution to prove the necessity of delays and the importance of raising the issue of delay promptly. The balancing test for speedy disposition was discussed and cited from *Capt. Roquero v. The Chancellor of UP-Manila, et al.*
