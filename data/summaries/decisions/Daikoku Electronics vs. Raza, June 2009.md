**Case Summary: Daikoku Electronics Phils., Inc. vs. Alberto J. Raza (G.R. No. 181688, June 05, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision and resolution dismissing Daikoku's appeal from the NLRC resolutions. The underlying issue is the illegal dismissal of Alberto J. Raza, a former company driver.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Daikoku's Obligation:** To comply with procedural rules regarding the filing of motions for reconsideration with the NLRC.Specifically, Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC 2005 Rules of Procedure requires motions for reconsideration to be filed within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the decision, resolution, or order.
*   **Employer's Liability for Illegal Dismissal:** If dismissal is deemed unlawful, the employer is liable for reinstatement, backwages (minus salary for suspension period), and attorney's fees (10% of total award).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Award:** The NLRC initially reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision but ordered Daikoku to pay wages from March 11, 2005, up to the promulgation of the NLRC's May 31, 2006 Resolution (provisionally computed as P 135,024.72).
*   **Potential Liability in CA-G.R. SP No. 100714:** Alberto's appeal is pending before the CA which deals with illegal dismissal, and potentially opens the door to a more severe liability depending on the court's decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of NLRC Resolution (Daikoku):** The CA found that Daikoku's motion for reconsideration was filed late (17 days instead of 10), rendering the NLRC's May 31, 2006, resolution final and executory against them.
*   **Substantive Issues Still Pending:** The Supreme Court's decision solely concerns the procedural issue of timeliness. The merits of the illegal dismissal claim remain to be decided by the CA in CA-G.R. SP No. 100714. The outcome of this case can result in financial and legal ramifications.
*   **Contempt:** Alberto's motion to cite Daikoku in contempt was denied by the CA.
*   **Delay:** The lengthy legal battle can result in increased costs and resources.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 15, Rule VII of the NLRC 2005 Rules of Procedure:** Governs motions for reconsideration.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** Raises issues under the Labor Code (PD 442) regarding just cause, due process, and remedies.
*   *United Paragon Mining Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 150959, August 4, 2006, 497 SCRA 638, 648:* States that the relaxation of procedural rules must have valid reasons for and underpinning it.
* *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ascot Holdings and Equities, Inc., G.R. No. 175163, October 19, 2007, 537 SCRA 396, 406:* Stressed that substantial justice is not a magic wand that automatically compels the Court to suspend procedural rules.
* *Espina v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 164582, March 28, 2007, 519 SCRA 327, 355:* States that the issue as to whether or not there was a valid ground for the dismissal of workers is factual in nature.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **NLRC's July 31, 2006 Resolution:** While it explicitly denied only Alberto's motion for reconsideration, Daikoku argued it should be interpreted as also denying their motion. The SC agreed that the NLRC's intent suggests denial based on belated filing, despite the lack of explicit wording.
*   **Reinstatement:** There is the question of whether Daikoku properly reinstated Alberto and how much should be paid to him for backwages.

**Overall Assessment:**

The SC upheld the CA's decision, not on the merits of the illegal dismissal case, but on Daikoku's failure to comply with procedural rules for filing a motion for reconsideration. This is crucial because while Daikoku lost this specific appeal, the core issue of whether Alberto's dismissal was illegal is still being litigated in a separate CA case (CA-G.R. SP No. 100714). The outcome of this case will determine Daikoku's ultimate liability for backwages, reinstatement, and other remedies. The case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in labor disputes.
