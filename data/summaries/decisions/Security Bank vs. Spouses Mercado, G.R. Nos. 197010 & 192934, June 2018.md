## Legal Document Summary: Security Bank Corporation v. Spouses Mercado (G.R. No. 192934 & 197010)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions seeking to nullify the CA decision regarding extrajudicial foreclosure sales and interest rates.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Revolving Credit Line Agreement:** Granted to Spouses Mercado by Security Bank.
    *   Clause 7: Interest on Availments - Interest rate determined *from time to time* by Security Bank, advised through monthly statement of account. Basis: Security Bank's prevailing lending rate at date of availment.
    *   Clause 17: Late Payment Charges - 2% per month computed on the amount due and unpaid or in excess of Credit Limit.
*   **Addendum to Revolving Credit Line Agreement:** Interest based on Security Bank's prevailing monthly rate, *annual rate shall in no case exceed* the total monthly prevailing rate as computed by Security Bank. Spouses give *continuing consent* without need of additional confirmation.
*   **Real Estate Mortgages:** Executed by Spouses Mercado to secure the credit line, covering properties in Lipa City, San Jose, and Batangas City.
*   **Extrajudicial Foreclosure:** Initiated by Security Bank due to default. Notices published but with technical description errors (Lot numbers and locations) in Batangas City/San Jose properties; erratum published only once.

**Obligations:**

*   **Spouses Mercado:** Repayment of principal loan, interest, and penalties as per the credit line agreement.
*   **Security Bank:** To provide accurate notices during foreclosure proceedings and not to impose unilateral and unconscionable interest rates.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Mercado:** Held liable for principal amount less proceeds from Lipa property, plus legal interest.
*   **Security Bank:** Liable for invalid foreclosure sales due to defective notice and unilateral imposition of interest rates.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Foreclosure Sale:** The primary contention is the defective notice due to errors in the technical description of the properties and only publishing the erratum once. **Key issue:** Compliance with Act No. 3135 (extrajudicial foreclosure). *San Jose v. Court of Appeals* (225 SCRA 450) supports the importance of accurate property descriptions. *OCA Circular No. 14* governing the format of sale does not excuse inaccurate and misleading data.
*   **Interest Rate Clause:** The clause allowing Security Bank to unilaterally determine interest rates is a major point of contention. **Key issue:** Violation of the principle of mutuality of contracts (Article 1308 of the Civil Code). The clause giving Security Bank continuing consent without additional confirmation is highly problematic.
*   **Floating vs Escalation Clause:** Although the agreement refers to a floating rate, it is being treated akin to an escalation clause due to the unilateral control by the bank, citing *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals* (196 SCRA 536), *Philippine Savings Bank v. Castillo* (649 SCRA 527), and *Silos v. Philippine National Bank* (728 SCRA 617). The court is relying on *BSP Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) & X305.3* which states that any floating rates must be market-based rates.
*   **Penalty Charges:** Although the court upheld the penalty stipulation, it was significantly reduced to 6% per annum from 24% per annum due to being iniquitous and unconscionable.
*   **Doctrine of Operative Facts:** Spouses Mercado unsuccessfully invoked this doctrine to argue that interest and penalty were considered paid by the auction sale and no interest should be charged until a decision on the interests is made.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Act No. 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law)
*   Article 1308, Civil Code (Mutuality of Contracts)
*   Article 1956, Civil Code (Interest in Writing)
*   Article 1229, Civil Code (Reduction of Penalty)
*   BSP Manual of Regulations for Banks (MORB) ยง X305.3
*   *San Jose v. Court of Appeals* (225 SCRA 450)
*   *Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals* (196 SCRA 536)
*   *Philippine Savings Bank v. Castillo* (649 SCRA 527)
*   *Silos v. Philippine National Bank* (728 SCRA 617)
*   *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (234 SCRA 78)
*   *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* (703 SCRA 439)
*   *MCMP Construction Corp. v. Monark Equipment Corp.* (739 SCRA 432)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "Security Bank's prevailing lending rate" is ambiguous and problematic, as it lacks a defined external reference.
*   The "continuing consent without need of additional confirmation" clause in the Addendum essentially removes the borrower's right to renegotiate or challenge interest rate changes.

**Conclusion:**

The court found the foreclosure invalid due to defective publication. The court also declared the interest rate provisions void for violating the principle of mutuality of contracts, as they allowed Security Bank to unilaterally set and adjust interest rates without a clear, market-based reference rate or requiring the borrower's explicit consent to each adjustment. Spouses Mercado are still liable for the principal amount and reduced interest/penalties, computed as indicated in the decision. Security Bank's control over interest rates rendered the contract heavily one-sided.
