Okay, here's a legal summary of *Federal Express Corporation v. Luwalhati R. Antonino and Eliza Bettina Ricasa Antonino*, G.R. No. 199455, June 27, 2018, tailored for a lawyer:

**Case Summary: *Federal Express Corporation v. Antonino***

**Core Issue:** Whether FedEx is liable for damages due to the non-delivery of a package containing checks to the designated consignee, where FedEx claims (1) the respondents failed to comply with the condition precedent of filing a written notice of claim within 45 days, and (2) respondents shipped prohibited items (checks misdeclared as documents) in violation of the Air Waybill.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling, holding FedEx liable for damages. The Petition for Review on Certiorari was DENIED.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Extraordinary Diligence:** Common carriers, like FedEx, are obligated under Article 1733 of the Civil Code to exercise extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over goods transported, from the time the goods are unconditionally placed in their possession until delivery to the consignee (Art. 1736). Failure to deliver to the correct consignee constitutes a breach of this obligation. The burden is on the carrier to prove they exercised extraordinary diligence.
*   **Air Waybill Terms:** The FedEx Air Waybill stipulated a condition precedent for claims: (1) a written claim within 45 days of acceptance of shipment, and (2) an action brought within two years from the date of delivery or when delivery should have occurred.
*   **Prohibited Items Clause:** The Air Waybill prohibited the transportation of "money (including but not limited to coins or negotiable instruments equivalent to cash such as endorsed stocks and bonds)."

**Liabilities and Damages:**

*   **Liability for Loss:** FedEx is liable for loss of the package due to failure to deliver to the designated consignee and failing to exercise extraordinary diligence.  The court considered the non-delivery as a loss.
*   **Damages:**  The trial court awarded, and the appellate court upheld, moral damages (₱200,000), exemplary damages (₱100,000), and attorney's fees (₱150,000).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Condition Precedent Compliance:**  The 45-day written claim requirement was ostensibly not met. However, the Court invoked *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 325 Phil. 303 (1996)* and Article 1186 of the Civil Code (obligor preventing fulfillment) to find **substantial compliance.** The Court attributed the failure to timely file to FedEx's "run-around" and evasive responses, hampering the respondents' ability to comply.
*   **Interpretation of "Money":**  The Court narrowly construed the Air Waybill's prohibition on "money," holding that checks (especially order instruments) are not "money" or "negotiable instruments equivalent to cash." This is a key finding that overcomes FedEx's defense. The Court held that checks payable to specific payees are not equivalent to cash as they require endorsement.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The Court emphasized that the Air Waybill is a contract of adhesion, drafted solely by FedEx. Any ambiguity is to be construed strictly *against* FedEx. This principle was used to interpret the "money" prohibition narrowly.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1733, 1734, 1735, 1736, 1186.**
*   **Republic Act No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act), specifically Section 52 (legal tender).**
*   **Negotiable Instruments Law (Section 30)**
*   ***Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 325 Phil. 303 (1996):***  Established the principle of substantial compliance with claim filing requirements when the carrier's actions hindered timely filing and applied Article 1186.
*   ***Philippine American General Insurance Co., Inc. v. Sweet Lines, Inc., 287 Phil. 212 (1992):*** Confirmed the validity of stipulations requiring notice of loss, but noted they should not be used to relieve carriers from just liability.
*   ***Cebu International Finance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 374 Phil. 844 (1999)*** & ***Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Court of Appeals, 383 Phil. 538 (2000):*** Established that checks are not legal tender.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The clauses pertaining to the 45-day period and the definition of "money" within the Air Waybill are the most contentious, as their interpretation directly impacts FedEx's liability. The ambiguity of the "money" clause, coupled with the adhesive nature of the contract, proved fatal to FedEx's defense.

**Conclusion:**

The case highlights the strict obligations imposed on common carriers and the disfavorable treatment afforded to contracts of adhesion. FedEx was found liable due to its failure to deliver to the proper consignee and the court's interpretation of the Air Waybill, finding substantial compliance with the claim filing deadline and holding that the shipped checks did not constitute "money" under the contract.
