## Legal Document Summary - Princess Talent Center v. Masagca (G.R. No. 191310)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding illegal dismissal and unpaid salaries of an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Princess Talent Center Production, Inc. (PTCPI) and Luchi Singh Moldes (Moldes).
*   **Respondent:** Desiree T. Masagca.
*   **Foreign Principal (SAENCO):** Saem Entertainment Company, Ltd.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Signed between Masagca and PTCPI (as agent of SAENCO) for 6 months, extendible by mutual agreement, as a singer in South Korea. Specifies venue (Siheung Tourist Hotel Night Club), compensation ($600/month), and termination clauses (just causes for both employer and employee).
*   **Section 10, RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act):** Governs money claims of OFWs. Imposes joint and several liability on the principal/employer (SAENCO) and recruitment/placement agency (PTCPI) for claims arising from the employment.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Court found that while Masagca's initial contract was for 6 months, it was effectively extended by another 6 months, and she was illegally dismissed during this extension.
*   **Unpaid Salaries (Claim Rejected):** The Court determined that Masagca failed to sufficiently prove that she wasn't being paid during her first 9 months in South Korea. The vouchers with her signature were seen as proof she was paid at the time.
*   **Liabilities:**
    *   SAENCO, PTCPI, and Moldes (jointly and severally) are liable for unpaid salaries for the remaining 3 months of the extended contract (July-September 2004), plus interest.
    *   SAENCO, PTCPI, and Moldes (jointly and severally) are liable for reimbursement of placement fees, plus interest.
    *   SAENCO, PTCPI, and Moldes (jointly and severally) are liable for attorney's fees (10% of the total monetary award).

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8042 (Migrant Workers Act), Section 10:** Governing money claims of OFWs and imposing joint and several liability.
*   **Labor Code, Article 277(b):** Requires notice and hearing for termination of employment.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v. Cabiles (740 Phil. 403):** Security of tenure extends to OFWs; principle of *lex loci contractus* applies; twin requirements of notice and hearing.
*   **Serrano v. Gallant Maritime Services, Inc. (601 Phil. 245):** Declared a clause in the Migrant Workers Act regarding salary claims unconstitutional.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames (716 Phil. 267):** Sets guidelines for the imposition of legal interest.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Contract Extension:** The primary point of contention is whether the employment contract was validly extended. While no written proof was provided, the court considered it valid based on the employee still working and being paid after the initial contract expired.
*   **Solidary Liability of Moldes:** Moldes' personal liability as a corporate officer is a point of contention, as she argued lack of malice or bad faith. However, the court emphasizes the statutory imposition of joint and several liability.
*   **Conflicting Factual Findings:** The varying conclusions of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA necessitate a deeper factual review by the SC, potentially leading to differing interpretations of evidence.
*   **New Evidence on Appeal:** The Court refused to consider new evidence submitted by Petitioners on appeal, arguing fairness and due process, which could be seen as a contentious issue.
*   **Hearsay vs. Credibility:** The court relies on the testimony of a Canadian citizen who was a regular patron of the club, which is a key factor in determining whether or not illegal activities were the justification for Masagca's dismissal.
