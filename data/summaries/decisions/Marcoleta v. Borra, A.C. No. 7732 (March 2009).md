Okay, here is a concise legal summary of the provided document in markdown format:

**Case:** *Marcoleta v. Borra and Brawner*, A.C. No. 7732, March 30, 2009 (601 Phil. 470)

**Nature:** Disbarment complaint against COMELEC Commissioners for alleged violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canons of Judicial Ethics, and Republic Act No. 6713.

**Facts:**  Atty. Marcoleta filed a disbarment complaint against Commissioners Borra and Brawner stemming from their handling of a party-list dispute within the COMELEC related to the ALAGAD party. Marcoleta alleged the respondents delayed resolution, manipulated issues, and rendered an erroneous decision exhibiting partiality, bad faith, and gross negligence. The complaint centers on an Omnibus Resolution penned by Borra and concurred in by Brawner and alleges violations of the Constitution (Art. VIII, Sec. 14), COMELEC rules, and laws. A supplemental complaint accused Brawner of tampering records.

**Key Provisions & Alleged Violations:**

*   **Delay in Resolution:** Violation of Section 8, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure (5-day mandate for resolution).
*   **Muddling the Issue:** Changing the stipulated issue to one outside COMELEC jurisdiction.
*   **Failure to Cite Law:** Violation of Sec. 14, Art. VIII of the Constitution and COMELEC rules requiring legal basis for decisions.
*   **Misrepresentation of Facts:** Alleged misrepresentation of facts and reliance on partisan documents.
*   **Violation of Canons:** Alleged violations of Canons 1 and 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct (integrity, impartiality, diligence) and Canons 4, 5, 6, and 17 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics (essential conduct, promptness, judicial opinions).
*   **Violation of RA 6713:** Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.

**Respondents' Arguments:**

*   The proper remedy is a Petition for Certiorari, not a disbarment complaint.
*   As members of a constitutional body, they enjoy a presumption of regularity.
*   As impeachable officers, they are insulated from disbarment without prior impeachment.
*   The Code of Judicial Conduct is inapplicable to COMELEC commissioners.
*   The COMELEC has its own set of internal rules and procedures.
*   The complaint is premature as the validity of resolutions is subject to review.

**Holding:**

*   Complaint against Brawner is dismissed as moot due to his death.
*   Complaint against Borra is dismissed for lack of merit.

**Rationale:**

*   **Impeachment Prerequisite:** An impeachable officer who is a member of the Bar must first be impeached before being disbarred, citing *Jarque v. Ombudsman*, *In Re: Raul M. Gonzales*, and *Cuenco v. Fernan*.
*   **Retirement:** Borra's retirement does not automatically warrant dismissal.
*   **Directory Period:** The prescribed periods for resolution are directory, not mandatory, citing *Alvarez v. Comelec*.
*   **Judicial vs. Administrative Remedy:**  The grounds for disbarment are based on errors of judgment which are proper for an appeal, not administrative action.
*   **Applicability of Canons:** Section 58 of the Omnibus Election Code makes the Canons of Judicial Ethics applicable only to the *quasi-judicial* functions of the COMELEC. The New Code of Judicial Conduct applies only to courts of law. Sanctions are only for judges and justices in the judiciary, not COMELEC members.
*   **No Evidence of Dishonesty:**  No specific incidents or sufficient evidence show dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct as a lawyer by Borra. The acts complained of relate to his duties as a COMELEC commissioner.
*   **Retirement Benefits:** The release of Borra's retirement benefits was in accordance with Office of the Ombudsman guidelines.
*   **Selective Prosecution:** Marcoleta singled out Borra and Brawner, but spared other commissioners.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Impeachment Shield:** The ruling reinforces the "impeachment shield" for covered officers, potentially limiting accountability for actions within their official capacity *unless* impeachment proceedings are successfully pursued.
*   **Scope of Quasi-Judicial Function:** The distinction between quasi-judicial and other functions of COMELEC members is potentially blurry.
*   **Standard of Proof:** The court requires "specific incidents and sufficient evidence" of dishonest conduct.
*   **Continuing Precedent:** The case reaffirms the primacy of the COMELEC's internal rules over the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   **The fact that a member is already retired complicates the legal proceedings.**
