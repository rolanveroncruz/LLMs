## Legal Document Summary: Ek Lee Steel Works Corporation v. Manila Castor Oil Corporation, G.R. No. 119033 (2008)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review) involving a collection suit arising from a construction contract.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Ek Lee Steel Works Corporation (Contractor)
*   **Respondents:** Manila Castor Oil Corporation (Owner), Romy Lim (President of MCOC)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Construction Contracts:** Seven letter-agreements existed for various construction projects (office building, fence, pavement, oil tanks, etc.).  Progress billing payment scheme was initially agreed upon.
*   **Verbal Agreement:** Petitioner alleges a subsequent verbal agreement for an additional warehouse (Building II), which respondent denies.
*   **Letter dated May 16, 1988:**  The CA considered this as a novation of previous agreements, setting a new completion date (June 15, 1988) for all works except the office building, with specific payment amounts tied to completion of different phases. The SC ruled that the 16 May 1988 letter did not extinguish the parties' obligations but modified the manner of payment from progress billing to a specific schedule of payments.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Ek Lee sued to collect P1,623,013.81, alleging non-payment.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Manila Castor Oil argued that Ek Lee failed to complete the work by the new deadline and had deficiencies in the work completed. It filed a counterclaim for damages, including surveyor's fees, contractor's fees, operating expenses, and lost income, resulting from a tilted oil tank allegedly due to poor installation.
*   **CA Decision:** Originally ordered Ek Lee to reimburse P70,000 and pay damages for besmirched reputation and moral damages to the respondents. The Supreme Court reversed the order to reimburse P70,000 as overpayment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Novation:** The central legal issue is whether the May 16, 1988 letter constituted a novation of the original contracts. The SC ultimately held that it did *not* extinguish the prior agreements but merely *modified* the payment schedule.  The ambiguity lies in interpreting the intent and effect of this letter. *Zapanta v. De Rotaeche, 21 Phil. 154, 159 (1912)*.
*   **Completion & Substantial Performance:** Whether Ek Lee substantially performed its obligations under the modified contract.  The SC found that Ek Lee did *not* complete the work by the revised deadline (June 15, 1988) due to incomplete work. Therefore, MCOC's obligation to pay did not arise.  Article 1234 of the Civil Code (substantial performance in good faith) was discussed, but ultimately found inapplicable as the contractor failed to complete work on time.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  Ek Lee failed to meet the burden of proof to demonstrate project completion and entitlement to payment.
*   **Evidence & Conflicting Reports:** Conflicting factual findings between the RTC and CA regarding the extent of completion.  The CA correctly questioned the probative value of the Davao Engineering Office report (Alindada Report) which lacked detail, but the SC did not disturb this finding.
*   **Delay:** Whether Manila Castor Oil was in delay for failing to make payments. The SC ruled MCOC was *not* in delay since the contractor did not complete the work by the set deadline (Art. 1169, Civil Code).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:**
    *   Article 1169 (Delay in reciprocal obligations)
    *   Article 1234 (Substantial Performance)
*   **Rules of Court:**
    *   Rule 45 (Petition for Review)
    *   Rule 130, Section 15 (Interpretation of Written Instruments)
    *   Rule 131, Section 1 (Burden of Proof)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The May 16, 1988 letter is the most contentious point, specifically its impact on previous contracts and the conditions precedent to payment. The interpretation of this letter was key to both the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court's analysis.

**Overall Outcome:** The Supreme Court denied Ek Lee's petition, affirming the CA's decision dismissing the complaint.
