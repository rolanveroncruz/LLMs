Okay, here's a legal summary of the document you provided, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Arroyo v. De Venecia*, G.R. No. 127255, June 26, 1998 (353 Phil. 623)

**Summary:** This Resolution denies a Motion for Rehearing and Reconsideration of the Court's prior decision dismissing a petition for certiorari and prohibition. The original petition challenged the validity of R.A. No. 8240, alleging that the House of Representatives violated its own rules during the approval of the conference committee report. The petitioners argued that Rep. Arroyo was improperly denied the floor and that House rules regarding motions and voting were disregarded.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Procedural Due Process in Legislative Process:**  Petitioners asserted their right to be heard was violated. They claimed Rep. Arroyo’s question, “What is that, Mr. Speaker?”, was a point of order/privileged question and should have been addressed before the vote.

*   **House Rules Compliance:**  The petitioners alleged violations of Rule XIX, §112 and Rule XVII, §103 of the Rules of the House, specifically concerning the proper procedure for stating a motion and taking votes.

*   **Quorum Requirements:** The petitioners argued that the court's statement on the repeated questioning of quorum was flawed.

**Court's Rationale/Findings:**

*   **Recognition from the Chair:** The Court held that Rep. Arroyo was not ignored but rather failed to properly seek recognition from the Chair before speaking, as required by House Rules (Rule XVI, §96) and Senate Rules (Rule XXVI, §59).
*   **Nature of the Question:**  The Court determined that Rep. Arroyo’s question (“What is that, Mr. Speaker?”) was not inherently a question of privilege (defined by Rule XX, §121) or a point of order as defined by Inocencio B. Pareja, *Parliamentary Guidelines: House of Representatives* 33 (1969).
*   **Established Practice:** The Court affirmed the established practice of approving conference committee reports by asking for objections, citing the prior pronouncements of then Majority Leader Arturo Tolentino (4 CONG. REC., 413-414 (Feb. 15, 1957).
*   **Opportunity for Reconsideration:** The Court pointed out that Rep. Arroyo had the opportunity to seek reconsideration of the Chair's ruling.
*   **Legislative Discretion:** The Court emphasized that non-compliance with internal rules of procedure in the House does not invalidate a law.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 8240:** The law whose validity was being challenged.
*   **Rules of the House of Representatives:** Rule XVI, §96; Rule XX, §121; Rule XIX, §112; Rule XVII, §103.
*   **Rules of the Senate:** Rule XXVI, §59
*   **Art. VIII, §1 of the Constitution:** Powers of the court.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Internal Rules vs. Constitutional Requirements:** The decision reinforces the principle that courts generally defer to the legislative branch on matters of internal procedure. However, the line between internal rules and constitutional requirements affecting the validity of a law can be blurry and could be subject to further litigation in different contexts.
*   **Chilling Effect on Dissent:** While the ruling emphasizes adherence to procedure, it could arguably discourage vigorous dissent if members fear being perceived as disrupting the legislative process by repeatedly raising procedural questions, even if legitimate.

**Conclusion:**

The Court upheld the validity of R.A. No. 8240, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the House of Representatives. The decision underscores the importance of following parliamentary procedure and reinforces the judiciary's limited role in reviewing the internal processes of the legislative branch. This case is primarily important for its rulings on legislative procedure and deference to the legislative branch on internal matters.
