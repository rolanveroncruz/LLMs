**Case Summary: *Hernald Bermillo y de Vera v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 246434, January 24, 2024**

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration in a drug possession case (violation of Section 11, Article II of RA 9165).

**Holding:** Motion for Reconsideration GRANTED; prior conviction REVERSED; Bermillo ACQUITTED due to failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Validity of Warrantless Arrest:** The Court initially upheld the in flagrante delicto arrest, relying on probable cause based on Bermillo's presence with Matias (the target of a buy-bust) and his attempt to discard an item (later found to be drugs). The Court initially gave credence to the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty by the police officers, citing *People v. Sembrano, 642 Phil. 476, 490 (2010)*.

*   **Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640):**  The *crux* of the reversal lies in the failure to properly establish the 4th link in the chain of custody. This link specifically focuses on the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court.

*   **Forensic Chemist's Testimony/Stipulation:** The parties stipulated to the forensic chemist's findings, but the stipulation *lacked crucial details* regarding the handling, storage, and preservation of the seized items *from the time they were turned over to the forensic chemist, up until its presentation in court.* Specifically absent were assurances that (1) the chemist received the article marked, sealed, and intact; (2) he resealed it post-examination; and (3) he applied his own markings. The stipulation did not also state who received the specimen after the forensic examination and how it was brought to the court as evidence.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution's Obligation:** The prosecution bears the burden of establishing an unbroken chain of custody to prove the *corpus delicti* beyond reasonable doubt (citing *People v. Cabrellos, 837 Phil. 429, 438 (2018)*.
*   **Police Obligation:** To follow Section 21, RA 9165 to ensure integrity of the chain of custody of seized dangerous drugs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Stipulation Sufficiency:**  Reliance on a deficient stipulation in lieu of the forensic chemist's testimony proved fatal to the prosecution's case. The lack of specific details regarding the handling of evidence, as outlined in *Largo v. People, 854 Phil. 144, 159 (2019)*, creates doubt about the drugs' integrity.
*   **Miniscule Amount of Drugs:** The small quantity of drugs (0.019 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride) magnified the need for strict compliance with chain of custody rules, drawing upon the principles enunciated in *People v. Holgado, 741 Phil. 78, 99 (2014)* and *Lescano v. People, 778 Phil. 460 (2016)*.

**Conclusion/Assessment:**

This case underscores the critical importance of meticulously documenting and adhering to the chain of custody requirements in drug cases.  A seemingly valid warrantless arrest can be undermined by evidentiary shortcomings related to chain of custody.  Defense counsel should scrutinize stipulations made in lieu of forensic chemist testimony to ensure they adequately address the handling and preservation of evidence, particularly when dealing with small quantities of drugs. The prosecution's failure to prove an unbroken chain led to acquittal despite the initial finding of probable cause for the arrest.
