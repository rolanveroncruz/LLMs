**Legal Document Summary: *Sanchez v. People***

**Case Citation:** 606 Phil. 762 (G.R. No. 179090, June 5, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution on a Petition for Review on Certiorari, reviewing a Court of Appeals (CA) decision which affirmed a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Other Acts of Child Abuse under R.A. No. 7610 in relation to P.D. No. 603.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) in relation to Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 (Child and Youth Welfare Code). Specific act: physical abuse (hitting the victim, VVV) who was a minor (16 years old).
*   **Appellant's Arguments:**
    *   Failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
    *   Defective Information, arguing the act is covered by Article 266 of the Revised Penal Code (Slight Physical Injuries) and therefore not within the jurisdiction of the RTC as a Family Court under R.A. No. 7610.
    *   VVV was not punished cruelly or unusually, nor deliberately subjected to indignities or humiliation. No evidence of prejudice to the child's development.
*   **Prosecution's Arguments:**
    *   The Information adequately alleges child abuse under R.A. No. 7610.
    *   Credible witnesses testified to the physical abuse.
    *   Affirmative defense raised during arraignment (unintentional act) shifts the burden of proof to the appellant.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the conviction but modifying the penalty.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Liability:** Found guilty of Other Acts of Child Abuse under Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610. Originally sentenced by the RTC, penalty modified by the CA, and further modified by the Supreme Court to four (4) years, nine (9) months and eleven (11) days of prision correccional, as minimum, to six (6) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum.
*   **State's Obligation:** To prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of child abuse as defined in R.A. No. 7610 and P.D. No. 603.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The RTC's initial ruling, affirmed by the CA, that the appellant admitted hitting the victim and therefore bore the burden of proving the act was lawful, is a potential area of contention. The appellant denies this.
*   **Information Defect:** Appellant's argument that the Information was defective as the act may constitute slight physical injuries, which is covered by the Revised Penal Code. The court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the information alleged acts punishable under R.A. 7610 in relation to P.D. 603, and the age of the victim necessitates it be treated as child abuse
*   **Application of Indeterminate Sentence Law:** There was disagreement regarding the proper application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The court held that because R.A. 7610 adopted penalties from the RPC the regular application for indeterminate sentencing applied.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7610:** Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.
*   **P.D. No. 603:** Child and Youth Welfare Code.
*   **Revised Penal Code:** Specifically, Article 266 (Slight Physical Injuries).
*   **Araneta v. People:** Clarifies the interpretation of Section 10(a) of R.A. No. 7610, distinguishing the four punishable acts (child abuse, cruelty, exploitation, and being responsible for conditions prejudicial to the child's development).
*   **People v. Simon, Cadua v. Court of Appeals, Dulla v. Court of Appeals:** Application of the indeterminate sentence law.
*   **Resty Jumaquio v. Hon. Joselito C. Villarosa** What controls is not the title of the information or the designation of the offense but the actual facts recited therein.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The intent of the Appellant. While the Court acknowledges that it could be interpreted as a low-level offense, since the victim was a minor it is considered child abuse.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction for Other Acts of Child Abuse, emphasizing the state's obligation to protect children from abuse as mandated by the Constitution. The defense's arguments regarding the defect in the Information, the lesser offense of slight physical injuries, and the lack of demonstrable harm were rejected. The Supreme Court modified the indeterminate sentencing to reflect the application of law in this situation.
