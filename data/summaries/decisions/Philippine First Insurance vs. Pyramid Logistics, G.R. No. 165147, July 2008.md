**Case Summary: Philippine First Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Pyramid Logistics and Trucking Corporation, G.R. No. 165147, July 9, 2008**

**Key Issue:** Whether the Regional Trial Court (RTC) acquired jurisdiction over Pyramid's complaint for specific performance and damages, given its alleged underpayment of docket fees. The central question is whether Pyramid deliberately evaded paying the correct docket fee and what effect this had on the trial court's jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   **Insurance Policies:** Pyramid seeks to recover proceeds from two insurance policies (Paramount and Philippine First) due to the loss of goods valued at P907,149.07.
*   **Complaint:** Pyramid filed a complaint for "specific performance and damages," seeking compliance with the insurance policies.
*   **Docket Fees:** Pyramid paid P610.00 as docket fees, assessed based on the attorney's fees amount (P50,000) specified in the prayer, omitting the loss amount.
*   **Prayer for Relief:** While the complaint states that goods lost were valued at P907,149.07, the *prayer* lacks a specific monetary demand beyond attorney's fees, implying an attempt to avoid higher docket fees.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Insurers (Petitioners):** Obligation to compensate Pyramid for covered losses under their respective policies.
*   **Insured (Respondent):** Obligation to pay the correct docket fees to properly invoke the court's jurisdiction.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Nature of Action:** While denominated as "specific performance," the Court of Appeals correctly determined that the action is essentially one for *collection of a sum of money* arising from the insurance policies. This is significant because it dictates how docket fees should be calculated.
*   **Deliberate Omission:** The Supreme Court finds that Pyramid deliberately omitted the amount of its claim in the prayer to evade higher filing fees. This constitutes abuse of court process.
*   **Amount in Prayer:** Lack of a specified amount in the prayer for relief (beyond attorney's fees) is a contentious point directly impacting jurisdictional amounts and docket fee assessment.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Manchester Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals (149 SCRA 562):**  A pleading which does not specify in the prayer the amount sought shall not be admitted or shall otherwise be expunged, and that the court acquires jurisdiction only upon the payment of the prescribed docket fee.
*   **Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion (170 SCRA 274):** While this case allows for the later payment of deficient docket fees, it doesn't excuse deliberate attempts to evade proper assessment.
*   **Tacay v. Regional Trial Court (180 SCRA 433):** Clarifies the effect of Sun Insurance on Manchester, allowing later payment of fees unless prescription has barred the claim. The court has authority to order the mistaken party to complete the docket fees in the course of the proceedings.
*   **Rules of Court and Circular No. 7-88:** Govern assessment of docket fees based on the sum claimed or value of the property in litigation.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (Canon 12):**  The lawyer must not unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse court processes.

**Legal Analysis and Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court held that Pyramid failed to specify in its prayer the amount of its claims/damages despite admittedly knowing the losses. This deliberate omission warrants denial of the petition based on Manchester ruling for failure to include the claims in the prayer. The court ruled that such omission shows the respondent's lack of regard for the rules. It also reminded Pyramid's counsel to observe Canon 12 of the Code of Professional Ethics.

**Recommendations:**

*   A motion for reconsideration of the court decision is futile.
*   Pyramid should make immediate payment of the remaining docket fee, otherwise its complaint will be dismissed.
*   The lawyer needs to make his client aware that he may be liable for disciplinary action due to his deliberate omission of the amount of its claim in the prayer.
