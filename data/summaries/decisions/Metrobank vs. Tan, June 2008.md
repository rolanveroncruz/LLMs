## Legal Document Summary: *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company vs. Jose B. Tan and Rey John Tan* (G.R. No. 159934)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding the issuance of a writ of possession.

**Facts:** Metrobank foreclosed on properties mortgaged by Jose B. Tan (and Ariel Tan via SPA), leading to an auction sale. Prior to the auction, Jose B. Tan filed an action to "Remove Cloud of Doubt on Title, Injunction." Another branch of the same court declared the mortgages void due to lack of consent of the spouse Eliza G. Tan, and because Jose B. Tan did not execute the real estate mortgages annotated at the back of his title, and the loans were fully paid (Civil Case No. 98-225).  Despite this, Metrobank obtained an *ex parte* writ of possession from a different branch (MC No. 2000-117) concerning some of the same properties. The Court of Appeals initially reversed the grant of the writ, citing interference with a co-equal court's judgment, but later modified its decision to hold the writ in abeyance pending the final outcome of Civil Case No. 98-225.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Act 3135, Sections 7 & 8:** Govern the procedure for extrajudicial foreclosure and the issuance of writs of possession. Section 7 details purchaser's right to petition for possession with bond, and Section 8 outlines the debtor's remedy to challenge the sale and cancel the writ.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank:** Obligated to follow the procedures outlined in Act 3135 for extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Debtors (Tans):** Obligated to honor valid mortgage agreements.
*   **Sheriff:** Duty to execute the writ of possession if validly issued.

**Liabilities:**

*   **If the foreclosure was improper (as initially found by the other branch), Metrobank could be liable for damages.**

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflicting Judgments:** Two branches of the same court initially issued conflicting decisions regarding the validity of the underlying mortgages. This creates uncertainty and potential grounds for challenge.
*   **Appeal of Civil Case No. 98-225:** The outcome of the appeal in Civil Case No. 98-225 directly impacts the validity of the foreclosure and the propriety of the writ of possession.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Respondent potentially lost the right to appeal the grant of the writ of possession and improperly sought relief via certiorari.
*   **Ex Parte Proceedings:** Notice to the Tans regarding the ex parte proceeding was not given.
*   **Void Mortgages:** The other trial court had already declared the mortgage null and void because of the fact that plaintiff Eliza G. Tan did not give her consent to all the real estate mortgages annotated at the back of her title and because plaintiff Jose B. Tan did not execute the real estate mortgages annotated at the back of his title

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Critical statutory framework governing the foreclosure process and the issuance of writs of possession.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Tan*** **(G.R. No. 163712):** **Critical: This case overturned the appellate court's ruling in CA G.R. CV No. 70742 (Civil Case No. 98-225) and dismissed the case, validating the extrajudicial foreclosure.**
*   **General Rule (Pendency of Civil Suit):** The pendency of a separate civil suit questioning the validity of the mortgage generally does not bar the issuance of a writ of possession because the same is a ministerial act of the trial court.
*   **Exception to the General Rule:** The present case falls under the exception to the general rule because it is attended with equitable considerations.
*   ***De Gracia v. San Jose*** **(94 Phil. 623 (1954)):** Trial court committed no grave abuse of discretion as no exercise of discretion is required.
*   ***PNB v. Hon. Adil, etc., et al.*** **(203 Phil. 492, 499 (1982)):** It is ministerial upon the court to issue a writ of possession in favor of a purchaser, provided that a proper motion is filed, a bond is approved, and no third person is involved.
*   ***PNB v. Hon. Adil, etc., et al.*** **(203 Phil. 492 (1982)):** The pendency of an action to annul the mortgage is not a ground for non-enforcement of the writ of possession.
*   ***San Fernando Rural Bank v. Pampanga Omnibus Development Corporation and Dominic G. Aquino*** **(G.R. No. 168088, 4 April 2007, 520 SCRA 564):**The trial court's order granting the writ of possession is final. The proper remedy for respondents is an appeal and not a petition for certiorari.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Mortgages:** The validity of the mortgage is a contentious issue.
*   **Notice of Ex Parte Proceedings:** Respondents claim to have not been notified of the hearing set by the court in Miscellaneous Case No. 2000-117.

**Summary & Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** Metrobank's petition, setting aside the Court of Appeals' decision and resolution. **The key factor is the Supreme Court's prior ruling in G.R. No. 163712, which validated the foreclosure by dismissing the underlying case challenging the mortgage's validity.**  The court reiterated that the issuance of a writ of possession is a ministerial duty under Act 3135, and the pendency of an action to annul the mortgage is not a bar to its issuance. The Respondents' proper remedy was an appeal, not certiorari.

Therefore, Metrobank is entitled to the writ of possession.
