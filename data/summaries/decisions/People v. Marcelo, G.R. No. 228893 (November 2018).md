**Case Summary: People v. Marcelo y Paguio, G.R. No. 228893, November 26, 2018 (843 Phil. 994)**

**Nature:** Appeal by certiorari from a CA Decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Joy Marcelo for illegal sale of *shabu* (methylamphetamine hydrochloride) under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Prohibits and penalizes the sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165 (Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs):** Mandates specific procedures for handling seized drugs, including immediate inventory and photography in the presence of the accused (or representative), a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official, all of whom must sign the inventory. This case applies the pre-amendment version of Section 21 since the buy-bust occurred in 2011.

**Core Elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs:**
*   A sale took place.
*   The illegal drug was presented as evidence.
*   The buyer and seller were identified.

**Key Findings and Reasoning:**

*   **Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution presented evidence that the buy-bust operation took place, the accused sold drugs to the poseur-buyer, and the drugs were recovered.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** The Court found that the prosecution *failed* to establish an unbroken chain of custody, specifically citing:
    *   **Delayed Marking:** The seized drugs were not immediately marked at the scene of the arrest. Marking occurred only after more than two hours at the barangay hall.
    *   **Missing Witnesses:** The absence of a representative from the media, DOJ, and an *elected* public official during the initial inventory and photography violated Section 21. A barangay Executive Officer (Ex-O) who is not an elected public official was the only third party witness present during the inventory conducted by SPO1 Cabinta at the barangay hall. The belated inventory at the police station with a media representative did not cure this defect.
*   **Failure to Provide Justifiable Grounds:** The prosecution failed to offer justifiable reasons for the non-compliance with Section 21. This is a *mandatory requirement* and not a mere technicality. The court cannot presume what the justifiable ground is, nor even assume its existence.
*   **Miniscule Amount:** The small amount of drugs involved (0.02g and 0.03g) demands heightened scrutiny, due to the possibility of planting and tampering.

**Statutory References:**

*   R.A. 9165, Section 5 and Section 21 (pre-amendment)
*   DDB Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002
*   Revised PNP Manual on Anti-Illegal Drugs Operations and Investigation

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   *People v. Andaya*
*   *People v. Salvador, et al.*
*   *People v. Mendoza*
*   *People v. Villarta*
*   *People v. Reyes*
*   *People v. Alvarado*
*   *People v. Carlit*
*   *People v. Guieb*
*   *People v. Holgado, et al.*
*   *People v. Lim*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Strict Interpretation of Chain of Custody:** The Court emphasizes a strict, literal compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165, holding that any break in the chain, without a justifiable reason, can lead to acquittal.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution bears the heavy burden of proving *both* compliance with Section 21 *and* providing justifiable grounds for any deviations. The court will not presume either.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA and RTC decisions, *acquitting* Joy Marcelo due to the prosecution's failure to prove an unbroken chain of custody and to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165.
