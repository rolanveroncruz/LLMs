Here's a legal summary of the document provided:

**Case:** *Stanfilco Employees Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Multi-Purpose Cooperative (SEARBEMCO) vs. DOLE Philippines, Inc. (Stanfilco Division), Oribanex Services, Inc. and Spouses Elly and Myrna Abujos* G.R. No. 154048, November 27, 2009.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) denial of SEARBEMCO's motion to dismiss DOLE's complaint for specific performance and damages. The core issue is whether the RTC or the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) has jurisdiction over the dispute arising from a Banana Production and Purchase Agreement (BPPA) between SEARBEMCO (seller) and DOLE (buyer).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Banana Production and Purchase Agreement (BPPA):** SEARBEMCO agrees to sell exclusively to DOLE all Cavendish bananas produced on its plantation. (Art. I)
*   **Exclusivity Clause (Art. V(p)):** SEARBEMCO is obligated to sell all bananas produced from the subject plantation exclusively to DOLE, except those rejected by DOLE, which can only be sold for domestic non-export consumption.
*   **Arbitration Clause (Art. IX):** All disputes arising from the BPPA shall be settled through arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.

**Alleged Breach and DOLE's Claims:**

DOLE alleges that SEARBEMCO breached the BPPA by selling rejected bananas to Oribanex (a competitor and exporter) through the Abujos spouses, violating the domestic non-export restriction. DOLE filed a complaint for specific performance and damages in the RTC.

**SEARBEMCO's Arguments:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** DARAB has exclusive jurisdiction because the dispute is an agrarian dispute under RA 6657, Sections 1 and 3(e) of Administrative Order No. 09, Series of 1998 (AO No. 9-98) and Section 5(a) and (c) of Administrative Order No. 02, Series of 1999 (AO No. 2-99),  as the BPPA is an agribusiness venture agreement.
*   **Prematurity:** DOLE failed to submit to arbitration as required by the BPPA and DAR AO No. 9-98, Article V, Sec. 30(g).
*   **No Violation:** SEARBEMCO sold to the Abujos spouses (third-party buyers, not exporters), thus complying with the BPPA.
*   **Defective Verification:** The original verification of the complaint was allegedly defective.

**Court's Rulings:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the RTC has jurisdiction. The dispute is not an agrarian dispute under Section 3(d) of RA 6657. There is no tenurial relationship between SEARBEMCO and DOLE (citing *Heirs of the Late Hernan Rey Santos v. Court of Appeals* and *Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*). The SC distinguished the facts from *Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Muti-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Dev't. Corporation* and *Cubero v. Laguna West Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc.* since those cases related to the *management, cultivation, and use* of CARP-covered agricultural lands.
*   **Cause of Action:** DOLE's complaint states a cause of action. Hypothetically admitting DOLE's allegations, the RTC could render a valid judgment for breach of contract (citing *Jimenez, Jr. v. Jordana*).
*   **Arbitration:** The arbitration clause in the BPPA does not apply because DOLE included third parties (Abujos spouses and Oribanex) in the lawsuit. Arbitral rulings would not bind non-parties. The SC expressly stated *Heirs of Augusto L. Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corporation* and *Del Monte Corporation-USA v. Court of Appeals* superseded *Toyota Motor Philippines Corp. v. Court of Appeals* on the issue of arbitration with third parties involved.
*   **DARAB Jurisdiction:** Due to the inclusion of third parties, the case does not fall under DARAB jurisdiction since BARC certification (required to invoke DARAB jurisdiction per RA No. 6657, Sec. 53) will be difficult/impossible to obtain.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "Domestic Non-Export Consumption":** The definition of this term in the BPPA (Exhibit A, if any) is crucial. The parties' intent on the scope of permissible sales is important. What constitutes "export" or "consumption" is not clearly defined and may be a point of contention.
*   **Liability of Abujos and Oribanex:** The success of DOLE's claims hinges on proving that Oribanex is indeed an exporter and that the Abujos spouses acted as conduits to circumvent the BPPA.
*   **Damages Calculation:** The damages DOLE can recover depends on proving the financial harm caused by SEARBEMCO's alleged breach.
*   **Validity of DAR Administrative Orders:** The court avoided deciding on the validity of DAR Administrative Orders, which implies these are not definitive guidance.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law)
*   DAR AO Nos. 9-98 and 2-99
*   *Heirs of the Late Hernan Rey Santos v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*
*   *Islanders CARP-Farmers Beneficiaries Muti-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. v. Lapanday Agricultural and Dev't. Corporation*
*   *Cubero v. Laguna West Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc.*
*   *Jimenez, Jr. v. Jordana*
*   *Heirs of Augusto L. Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corporation*
*   *Del Monte Corporation-USA v. Court of Appeals*

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed the CA's decision, holding that the RTC has jurisdiction over the dispute, DOLE's complaint states a cause of action, and arbitration is not required due to the involvement of third parties. The key challenge for DOLE is proving the actual sale to Oribanex for export and quantifying the damages suffered.
