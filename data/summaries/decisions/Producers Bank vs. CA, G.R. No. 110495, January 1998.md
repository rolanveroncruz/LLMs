**Legal Document Summary for Producers Bank v. Court of Appeals and State Investment House, Inc.**

**Case:** *Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals and State Investment House, Inc.* (G.R. No. 110495, January 29, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the trial court's order to admit written interrogatories.

**Background:**
*   State Investment House Inc. (SIHI) sued Producers Bank of the Philippines (PBP) for unpaid interest on Certificates of Time Deposit (CTDs) and the principal amount of other CTDs.
*   PBP claimed it had already paid the interest and that the principal amount CTDs were issued to Johnny Lu, not SIHI, and were already paid.
*   During rebuttal, SIHI served written interrogatories to PBP, which PBP moved to quash.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Main Issue:** Whether the trial court erred in allowing SIHI to serve written interrogatories on PBP during the rebuttal stage.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, holding that the timing of written interrogatories is within the trial court's discretion, as per Rule 23 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Relevance of Interrogatories:** The Court emphasized that the interrogatories sought information relevant to PBP's defense related to payments made to a third party.
*   **Discretion of Trial Court:** Trial courts have broad discretion regarding discovery matters, which will only be overturned upon a showing of abuse or improvidence affecting the substantial rights of the parties.
*   **No time frame for discovery:** The rules do not dictate a time frame for written interrogatories other than to say it needs the court's permission after jurisdiction is obtained, or an answer has been filed.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**
*   PBP is obligated to answer the written interrogatories served by SIHI.

**Potential Risks:**
*   PBP could be exposed to potential liability if the answers to the interrogatories contradict its previous assertions or reveal inconsistencies in its defense.
*   The information gained through the interrogatories could strengthen SIHI's case regarding the unpaid principal amount.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 23 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (formerly Rule 24)**: Governs depositions and discovery, including written interrogatories.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 204 SCRA 212:**  Expounds on the broad and liberal treatment afforded to discovery procedures to allow for preparation of trial.
*   **Donato v. CA, 217 SCRA 196 (1993):** States that a trial court's findings of fact are given great weight and shouldn't be disturbed on appeal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**
*   The primary point of contention is the timing of the interrogatories. While the rules allow for discovery after an answer is filed, the timing at the rebuttal stage is questioned. The court defers to the discretion of the trial court in this matter.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the trial court's decision to allow SIHI to serve written interrogatories on PBP during the rebuttal stage. This decision emphasizes the broad discretion of the trial court in managing discovery and underscores that discovery procedures can be used to explore facts relevant to a party's defense, even late in the proceedings. PBP now faces the obligation to respond to the interrogatories, with the risk that the responses might reveal weaknesses in its case or contradict its prior assertions.
