**Case Summary: *People v. Pascual*, G.R. No. 171089 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal of conviction for Statutory Rape.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Defective Information Argument Rejected:** The Court affirmed the conviction, rejecting the argument that the Information was defective due to a discrepancy between the alleged date of the offense (1998) in the Information and the victim's testimony (1997). The Court held that the precise date is not an essential element of rape (citing *People v. Baring, Jr.*, 425 Phil. 559, 573 (2002) and *People v. Sayao, Jr.*, 405 Phil. 1, 9 (2001)), and that the Information sufficiently apprised the accused of the charges (citing *People v. Nazareno*, G.R. No. 167756, April 8, 2008). The lack of a specific date doesn't invalidate the information, especially when the essential elements are present. The court affirmed the conviction despite minor inconsistencies of the date.

*   **Statutory Rape Elements:** Reaffirmed the elements of statutory rape under Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code: carnal knowledge of a woman under twelve (12) years of age. Proof of force is not required (citing *People v. Canonigo*, 392 Phil. 78, 90 (2000) and *People v. Pangilinan*, G.R. No. 171020, March 14, 2007, 518 SCRA 358, 389).

*   **Penalty:** Affirmed the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.

*   **Parole Ineligibility:** Reaffirmed that persons sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* are not eligible for parole (citing *People v. Tuazon*, G.R. No. 168650, October 26, 2007, 537 SCRA 494, 511).

*   **Damages:** Affirmed the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages. Added an award of P25,000.00 as exemplary damages (citing *People v. Domingo*, G.R. No. 177744, November 23, 2007, 538 SCRA 733, 738-739).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Vagueness Argument:** While the Court rejected the defective information argument, a persistent defendant might attempt to relitigate this issue based on due process concerns if the evidence at trial significantly deviates from the alleged time frame in the Information, potentially impacting the defendant's ability to prepare a defense.

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court relied heavily on the victim's testimony. Challenges to the credibility of the victim, while unsuccessful in this case, are always a potential risk in sex offense cases.
