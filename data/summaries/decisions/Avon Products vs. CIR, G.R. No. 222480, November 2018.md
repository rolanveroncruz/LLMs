## Legal Document Summary: Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue

**Case:** Avon Products Manufacturing, Inc. (Avon) v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), G.R. No. 222480, November 7, 2018.

**Subject Matter:** Deficiency excise tax assessment on evaporated denatured ethyl alcohol during transit.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Avon, a manufacturer of perfumes, purchases denatured alcohol. A BIR permit exempts denatured alcohol from excise tax if used solely in production, but imposes excise tax on volume discrepancies between purchase and receipt (Condition No. 3).
*   **Dispute:** The BIR assessed excise tax on 21,163.48 liters of denatured alcohol that evaporated during transit from Avon's supplier, despite Avon possessing a Permit to Buy/Use Denatured Alcohol. The BIR based this assessment on the premise that any shortage is taxable, due to Section 22 of RR 3-2006.
*   **NIRC Sec. 134:** Exempts denatured alcohol of at least 180° proof (90% absolute alcohol) from excise tax under Section 141, if suitably denatured and unfit for oral intake.
*   **BIR's Argument:** Avon failed to prove the denatured alcohol met the proof requirement.
*   **Avon's Argument:** Denatured alcohol is exempt. RR 3-2006 applies to distilled spirits, not denatured alcohol. The *La Tondeña* case (116 Phil. 398 (1962)) supports non-taxation of unintentional losses prior to conversion into a finished product. The condition in the BIR permit is contrary to NIRC.
*   **CTA Rulings:** The CTA (both Second Division and *En Banc*) upheld the deficiency assessment, applying RR 3-2006.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Avon:** Initially obligated to pay deficiency excise tax, surcharge, deficiency interest, and delinquency interest as determined by CTA. Ultimately not obligated to pay anything as the case was decided in their favour.
*   **BIR:** Obligated to correctly apply tax laws and regulations, cannot arbitrarily impose excise tax without legal basis.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Condition No. 3 of BIR Permit:** Could be deemed an attempt by the BIR to circumvent the statutory exemption provided by Section 134 of the NIRC.
*   **Application of RR 3-2006:**  Its applicability to denatured alcohol (as opposed to distilled spirits) is a contentious point. The Supreme Court (SC) found no legal basis for extending the regulation to denatured alcohol, especially when it did not undergo any rectification or distillation process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Sec. 129, Sec. 134, Sec. 141. Sec. 106A, Sec. 148(d), Sec. 248(A)(3), Sec 249(B), Sec 249(C), Sec. 133
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 9334:** Amendment of Section 141 of the NIRC
*   **Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 3-2006:** Implementing guidelines on alcohol and tobacco products, specifically Section 22 regarding losses on distilled spirits.
*   ***La Tondeña Inc., v. Collector of Internal Revenue, et. al.*** **(116 Phil. 398 (1962)):** Supports non-taxation of unintentional losses prior to conversion into a finished product
*   ***Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation*** **(727 Phil. 506 (2014)):** Defines how "excise tax" has changed over time, attaching itself to the good manufactured or produced.
*   ***Petron Corporation v. Tiangco*** **(G.R.):** Defines "excise tax" as a tax on certain specified goods or articles.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The definition of "suitably denatured" in RR No. 3-2006 and whether the denatured alcohol in this case met that definition (although, this was cleared up when the BIR's own letter indicated it had proof that the denatured alcohol was over 90%).

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Granted Avon's Petition:** Reversed the CTA's decision.  Held that the denatured alcohol was exempt from excise tax because it met the proof requirement (over 90%) and did not undergo any process to render it fit for oral intake.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Excise tax attaches only after the ethyl alcohol is processed, rectified, or distilled.
    *   Section 22 of RR 3-2006 does not apply to losses of denatured alcohol that did not undergo further processing.
    *   Tax statutes are construed strictissimi juris against the government, preventing application by implication.

**Implications:**

This case clarifies that excise tax on denatured alcohol is not automatically triggered by mere shortages during transit. It emphasizes the need for a factual determination that the alcohol has been processed, rectified, or distilled before the excise tax attaches. It also reinforces the principle of strict construction against the taxing authority.
