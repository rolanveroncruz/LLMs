## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-16-2424

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on a Motion for Partial Reconsideration filed by Judge Globert J. Justalero regarding a prior decision suspending him for one year for gross ignorance of the law and procedure, and gross misconduct.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Penalty Deemed Served:** The Court granted Judge Justalero's request to consider his prior preventive suspension (from September 30, 2016) as having satisfied the one-year suspension penalty.
*   **Award of Back Salaries/Benefits:** The Court awarded Judge Justalero back salaries, allowances, and other economic benefits, but only from September 30, 2017, up to the date of his reinstatement. This accounts for the one-year period that was served to satisfy the suspension.
*   **Prospective Guidelines:** The Court established guidelines for awarding back salaries/benefits in future administrative cases, based on exoneration, dismissal, or penalties of suspension/fine/reprimand, and considering the cause of any delays in resolution.

**Obligations:**

*   **Judge Justalero:** To submit a Manifestation to the Court stating the date of his actual reinstatement.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Justalero had been found guilty of the charges against him.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Ambiguity regarding the exact calculation of back salaries and benefits due, which may necessitate further clarification. The Resolution focuses on the "from September 30, 2017" date, but doesn't detail how benefits should be computed based on his salary grade, allowances, and other factors.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The award of back salaries is granted "pro hac vice," suggesting a narrow application limited to the specific facts of this case. This might limit its precedential value.
*   The "equity considerations" argument, while partially successful, could be subject to further litigation if the parties disagree on the implementation of the back pay award.
*   The retroactive application of A.M. No. 21-08-09-SC and its impact on situations not specifically envisioned by the original rules could create uncertainty in future cases.
