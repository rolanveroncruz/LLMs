**Legal Document Summary: Aklan College, Inc. v. Perpetuo Enero, et al. (G.R. No. 178309)**

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court on a petition for review on certiorari assailing the CA's decision regarding illegal dismissal and entitlement to 13th-month pay and service incentive leave (SIL) pay.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Aklan College, Inc. (educational institution)
*   **Respondents:** Perpetuo Enero, Arlyn Castigador, Nuena Sermon, and Jocelyn Zolina (former high school teachers)

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Dismissal:** The NLRC reversed the LA's decision, ruling the teachers' dismissal was valid due to instigating students to protest against the high school principal (considered misconduct under Art. 282(a) of the Labor Code and Section 16 of the Education Act of 1982, and paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 94 of the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools). The Supreme Court upholds this.
*   **13th Month and SIL Pay:** The NLRC ordered payment of 13th-month pay and SIL pay, which the CA affirmed.
*   **Computation of Benefits:** The CA modified the NLRC's computation of 13th-month pay and SIL pay based on the teachers' employment history.

**Liabilities:**

*   Aklan College, Inc. is liable to pay the respondents their unpaid 13th-month pay and SIL pay, with the specific amounts for each respondent as modified by the CA.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** The Supreme Court reiterates that it's not a trier of facts and relies on the CA's findings that the teachers were not paid these mandatory benefits.
*   **Non-Appealing Party's Relief:** While the general rule is that a non-appealing party cannot obtain affirmative relief, the CA's modification of the monetary award in favor of the respondents was upheld because it involved a "just, fair and complete resolution of the case" and corrected an error in the NLRC's computation.
*   **Legal Justification for Dismissal:** The legality of the dismissal hinges on whether the teachers' actions constituted "serious misconduct" or other grounds under Art. 282 of the Labor Code and relevant regulations.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 95 & 282:** Governing SIL pay and termination by employer, respectively.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 851:** Mandating 13th-month pay.
*   **Education Act of 1982, Sec. 16:**  Defines teachers' obligations.
*   **Manual of Regulations for Private Schools, Sec. 94:**  Lists causes for terminating school personnel.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 51, Sec. 8:** Defines the issues that may be decided by the appellate court.
*   **Case Law:** Cited precedents regarding factual findings of the CA, rights of non-appealing parties, and discretionary power of appellate courts.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around whether the teachers' participation in the student protests was instigation amounting to misconduct warranting dismissal, or protected freedom of expression. The NLRC and CA found it to be instigation, thereby justifying the dismissal, which the Supreme Court affirms.
*   The propriety of the CA increasing the monetary awards for 13th month pay and SIL pay in favor of the non-appealing respondents, although generally not permissible, was justified under the exception of achieving a complete resolution of the case and avoiding piecemeal justice.

**Overall Assessment:**

The employer, Aklan College, Inc., bears the financial burden of paying the back benefits, despite the dismissal of the employees being deemed valid. The CA's modification of the benefit calculation highlights the judiciary's role in ensuring just compensation, even when procedural technicalities exist. The case turns heavily on the factual determination of the teachers' role in the student protests.
