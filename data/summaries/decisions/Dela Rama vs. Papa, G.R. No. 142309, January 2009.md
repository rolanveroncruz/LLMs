## Legal Document Summary: Dela Rama v. Papa, G.R. No. 142309

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision reversing the Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision, involving cancellation of title due to an allegedly forged deed of sale.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Juan and Eugenia Dela Rama (original registered owners)
*   **Respondents:** Oscar and Ameurfina Papa (subsequent titleholders)

**Key Issue:** Validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated March 29, 1985, transferring property from Petitioners to Respondents. Petitioners allege forgery.

**RTC Decision:** Ruled in favor of Petitioners, annulling the 1985 deed of sale and reinstating Petitioners' title. Found the signatures were forged, based on the testimony and behavior of Oscar Papa.

**CA Decision:** Reversed the RTC, upholding the validity of the deed of sale. The CA held that Petitioners failed to prove forgery with clear, positive, and convincing evidence, relying on the presumption of regularity of a notarized document.

**Supreme Court Decision:** Grants the Petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Notarization:** Emphasizes proper notarization as prerequisite for a deed to be considered a public document and enjoy the presumption of due execution and authenticity. Cited *Public Act No. 2103* regarding acknowledgments.  If acknowledgement does not comply with *Public Act No. 2103*, the document is considered private.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Initially rests on Petitioners to prove forgery. However, Supreme Court rules that because Papa admitted he didn't sign the deed of sale in front of the notary public, the deed lacks the presumption of regularity. This shifts the *burden of evidence* (not the ultimate burden of proof) to Respondents to prove the deed's authenticity.
*   **Evidence of Forgery:** Considers testimony of Juan Dela Rama (disavowing signature), and crucially, the admissions of Oscar Papa (as a hostile witness) as sufficient to establish a prima facie case of forgery. *Emas v. De Zuzuarregui and Aguilar* and *Alo v. Rocamora* were cited regarding the admissibility of the owner's testimony to disavow their signature.
*   **Duty of Due Diligence:** The fact that the Papas did not attempt to ascertain if the individuals they were working with had permission to sell the land in question, proved the lack of due diligence, and demonstrated they were not acting in good faith.
*   **Rules of Evidence:** *Rule 132, Section 22*, regarding proving genuineness of handwriting, is discussed. The Supreme Court clarifies that the testimony of the alleged writer *is* admissible under this rule. *Section 19, Rule 132* clarifies that the document in question here is not public, because its validity is in question.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Deed of Sale:** The 1985 deed of sale is declared null and void.
*   **Loss of Title:** Respondents lose title to the property (TCT No. 102128).
*   **Purchaser in Bad Faith:** Respondents are deemed not to be purchasers in good faith, negating potential defenses based on good faith purchase for value.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Public Act No. 2103, Section 1:** Requirements for acknowledgment before a notary public.
*   **Rule 132, Sections 19 & 22, Rules of Court:** Admissibility of documents and proof of handwriting.
*   **Tigno v. Sps. Aquino, 486 Phil. 254 (2004):** Applying preponderance of evidence standard when notarization is irregular.
*   **Emas v. De Zuzuarregui and Aguilar, 53 Phil. 197 (1929):** Admissibility of testimony disavowing signatures.
*   **Alo v. Rocamora, 6 Phil 201 (1906):** Admissibility of testimony to establish the authenticity of the document.
*   **Abad v. Guimba, G.R. No. 157002, 29 July 2005, 465 SCRA 356:** Rules on ascertaining mortgagee in good faith.
*   **Wigmore on Evidence**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The 1985 Deed of Absolute Sale is considered a private document, which removes the presumption of regularity of a notarized document. The court determines that the Papa's signature was not secured in the presence of the Dela Rama's, who had been recognized to be the registered owners of the land in question.
*   **"Standard practice" of signing documents separately:** The court *explicitly rejects* arguments based on alleged industry practices (e.g., buyer signing first) if they conflict with the clear requirements for proper acknowledgment under Public Act No. 2103.

**Potential Arguments/Issues for Counsel:**

*   **Authentication of Signature (Dela Rama):** The Court notes that "standard practice" to authenticate signatures is that the individual in question will sign the document in front of a notary public.
*   **Absence of Key Witnesses:** The failure of respondents to present the notary public, Mrs. Galeos, or Mrs. Reyes, all of whom allegedly had personal knowledge of the transaction, to support the authenticity of the document is highly damaging to their case.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony (Papa):** Papa's inability to recall key details of the transaction (e.g., who he paid, how the transaction was handled) severely undermines his credibility and the authenticity of the sale.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found compelling evidence to support the claim of forgery, primarily based on Papa's own testimony, as well as the fact that The Papas made little effort to ensure they were working with authorized figures. The Court prioritized the proper application of evidence rules and the need for a regular notarization process.
