**Case Summary: *Spouses Julieta B. Carlos and Fernando P. Carlos v. Juan Cruz Tolentino*, G.R. No. 234533, June 27, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision reversing the RTC's dismissal of a Complaint for Annulment of Title and Damages.

**Facts:**

*   Juan Tolentino (Juan) sought annulment of title, alleging forgery of a Deed of Donation transferring his conjugal property to his grandson, Kristoff Tolentino (Kristoff). Kristoff subsequently sold the property to Spouses Carlos.
*   RTC found the Deed of Donation to be forged regarding Juan's signature but upheld Spouses Carlos' title as good faith purchasers for value based on Kristoff’s title at the time of the sale to spouses Carlos.
*   CA reversed, finding Spouses Carlos negligent in failing to investigate Kristoff’s title properly.
*   The Supreme Court acknowledged that Juan's signature on the Deed of Donation was forged and that the property was conjugal. Mercedes signature to the Deed of Donation was never contested and deemed admitted.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Conjugal Property Rights (Civil Code/Family Code):** The property was acquired during the marriage of Juan and Mercedes. Thus it is considered conjugal property and each owns a one-half interest. The husband and wife are deemed to have equal ownership interests in the property.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The central issue is whether Spouses Carlos were purchasers in good faith. The SC held that the good faith purchase only extends to the one-half interest of Mercedes.
*   **Deed of Donation:** The Deed of Donation is void as to Juan’s one-half interest due to the forgery of his signature. However the Mercedes signature was never contested and this results in Mercedes validly donating her one-half interest in the property.
*   **Obligations to Reimburse:** Kristoff is obligated to reimburse Spouses Carlos half of the purchase price since they are declared to only have ownership to one-half of the property.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Kristoff Tolentino:** Liable for reimbursement of one-half of the purchase price (P1,150,000.00) to Spouses Carlos.
*   **Spouses Carlos:** Limited to co-ownership of one-half of the property.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Partition Suit:** The co-ownership necessitates a partition of the property. Litigation regarding partition can be lengthy and costly.
*   **Valuation Discrepancies:** Valuation of the property for partition purposes could lead to disputes.
*   **Enforcement of Reimbursement:** The collection of the reimbursement amount from Kristoff may present challenges.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of due diligence required for "good faith purchaser" when a title appears facially valid, but stems from a potentially questionable donation.
*   Impact of Mercedes' death on her power to donate prior to termination of the partnership.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles regarding conjugal partnership of gains (Art. 119, 160), co-ownership (Art. 493), unjust enrichment (Art. 22).
*   **Family Code:** Articles regarding conjugal partnership of gains, particularly regarding its termination (Art. 105, 126).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari).

**Case Law:**

*   *Arrogante v. Deliarte* (G.R. No. 152132, July 24, 2007): Used as an analogy to validate Mercedes' relinquishment of rights.
*   *Abalos v. Macatangay, Jr.* (G.R. No. 155043, September 30, 2004): Emphasizes the requirement for congruence of wills in disposing of conjugal property.
*   *Rufloe v. Burgos, G.R. No. 143573, January 30, 2009 and Heirs of Domingo Hernandez, Sr. v. Mingoa, Sr., G.R. No. 146548, December 18, 2009* Factual issues are not usually within the Supreme Court's purview.

**Conclusion:**

The SC partially granted the petition, declaring Juan and Spouses Carlos as co-owners of the property (50-50 undivided interest). This ruling presents both an opportunity for negotiated resolution through partition and potential risks associated with co-ownership disputes. Kristoff's liability for reimbursement is a crucial aspect for Spouses Carlos to pursue.
