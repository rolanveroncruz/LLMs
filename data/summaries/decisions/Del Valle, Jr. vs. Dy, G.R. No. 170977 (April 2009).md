**Legal Document Summary: *Del Valle, Jr. v. Dy, 603 Phil. 346 (2009)***

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which set aside RTC orders dismissing a complaint for injunction and damages filed by Francis Dy against Labor Arbiter Del Valle and NLRC Sheriff Alemania. The core issue involves the jurisdiction of regular courts versus labor tribunals in cases arising from execution of labor judgments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Labor Arbiter's Decision:** Labor Arbiter Del Valle issued a decision in favor of Clea Deocariza in an illegal dismissal case against L.C. Big Mak, ordering reinstatement and payment of monetary benefits (P48,756.72).
*   **Writ of Execution:** A writ of execution was issued after L.C. Big Mak failed to appeal the decision. Sheriff Alemania levied upon L.C. Big Mak's property (flour and sugar).
*   **Dy's Complaint:** Francis Dy (owner of L.C. Big Mak) filed a complaint for injunction and damages in the RTC, alleging lack of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, and denial of substantial justice on the part of the Labor Arbiter. He claimed Deocariza was not his employee.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Jurisdictional Conflict:** The central legal issue is whether the RTC had jurisdiction over Dy's complaint. The Supreme Court (SC) found that the complaint essentially challenged the labor arbiter's decision and the execution thereof, placing it within the exclusive jurisdiction of the labor tribunals.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** Dy alleged denial of due process due to lack of notice of the labor proceedings. However, the SC emphasized that notices were properly served at L.C. Big Mak's head office.
*   **Third-Party Claim Procedure:** The SC highlighted that even if Dy were considered a third party to the labor case, he should have pursued his claim (regarding the levied property) through the established third-party claim procedure outlined in the NLRC's Manual on Execution of Judgment, *before* filing a civil case in the RTC.
*   **Estoppel:** Dy's claim of sole ownership of the levied goods contradicted his earlier statement in the RTC complaint where he stated that the property belongs to L.C. Big Mak. The court applied estoppel due to this inconsistency.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  The CA's application of Rule 65 (certiorari) was questioned, as the SC held that appeal was the appropriate remedy.
*   **Jurisdiction over Labor Disputes:** The SC reiterated the established principle that regular courts lack jurisdiction over labor cases and incidents arising therefrom. *Deltaventures Resources, Inc. v. Cabato* (2000) cited for the principle that regular courts lack jurisdiction over execution of labor judgements.
*   **NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment:**  The SC explicitly referenced the NLRC Manual's third-party claim procedure, which Dy failed to follow. This manual dictates the process for resolving claims over levied property.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** Dy disputed the existence of an employer-employee relationship with Deocariza. However, the court found that Israel was an employee of L.C. Big Mak, discrediting Dy's franchise theory. The SC found that he failed to substantiate this claim.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and reinstated the RTC orders dismissing Dy's complaint. The SC emphasized the exclusive jurisdiction of labor tribunals over matters arising from labor disputes and their execution, and that the remedy of appeal was available. The SC decision hinged on the principle of exclusive jurisdiction of labor tribunals over issues stemming from labor cases, emphasizing the importance of following established procedures for third-party claims in execution proceedings as outlined in the NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment. This case clarifies that regular courts should refrain from intervening in labor cases, and that those claiming third-party interests must first exhaust remedies before the labor arbiter.
