**Case:** *Bienvenido C. Gilles vs. Court of Appeals, Schema Konsult, and Edgardo Abores* (G.R. No. 149273, June 5, 2009)

**Summary:** This case involves a complaint for illegal dismissal filed by Bienvenido Gilles against Schema Konsult, Inc. (SKI) and its President, Edgardo Abores. Gilles was a Principal Engineer of SKI, assigned to a project in India under an agreement between SKI and Carl Bro International (CBI). He resigned from the CBI project due to personal and financial difficulties, then left India. SKI subsequently terminated his employment. The Supreme Court ruled that while Gilles' departure from the CBI project constituted willful disobedience and gross neglect of duty, he was constructively dismissed due to SKI's failure to timely pay his salary, thus creating unbearable working conditions.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agreement Regarding Staff Provision:** Governs the relationship between SKI and CBI, including Gilles' salary and subsistence allowance. Specifically points 4, 15.
*   **Labor Code Art. 282 (Termination by Employer):** Outlines just causes for termination, including serious misconduct and gross neglect of duty.
*   **Labor Code Art. 279 (Security of Tenure):** Mandates reinstatement and backwages for unjustly dismissed employees. In this case, the Supreme Court waived reinstatement due to strained relations and awarded seperation pay.
*   **Labor Code Art. 103:** Obligations to pay wages on time.
*   **CBI's obligation to Pay SKI:** CBI was obligated to pay SKI monthly for the duration of Gilles' assignment, per the Agreement. This payment was inclusive of Gilles' salary, social charges, insurances, leave pays, taxes and duties, relocation costs, and all living expenses beyond subsistence allowance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Schema Konsult, Inc. (SKI):** Liable for separation pay (one month per year of service), full backwages from June 7, 1993 (date of illegal dismissal) until finality, moral damages (Php100,000.00). Constructive dismissal was found because SKI failed to pay Gilles' salary on time.
*   **Edgardo Abores:** Not held solidarily liable, as malice or bad faith was not sufficiently proven.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Termination for cause vs. constructive dismissal:** SKI argued termination for cause (willful disobedience, gross neglect of duty under Article 282 of the Labor Code), while Gilles argued illegal dismissal. The Supreme Court found constructive dismissal. The ambiguity lies in the interpretation of "willful disobedience" given the circumstances, specifically the unpaid wages and adverse working conditions.
*   **Ambiguity in the definition of Regular Employee:** Though Gilles was officially the employee of SKI, it was unclear the rights that entitled him in the terms of conditions, especially when assigned as a consultant. The Supreme Court noted that Gilles remained a regular employee of SKI all time he was employed as Aquaculture Engineer of the Project
*   **Jurisdiction (Intra-corporate vs. Labor Dispute):** SKI initially argued that the case was an intra-corporate dispute falling under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The Court correctly determined it was a labor dispute under the NLRC's jurisdiction. This hinges on whether the primary issue is reinstatement as an officer (SEC) or as an employee (NLRC).
*   **Resignation vs. Termination:** The letter from Gilles to CBI might have been interpreted as a resignation from SKI as well, the Court focused on the actions of SKI and that Gilles was not paid salary on time and therefore made a constuctive dismissal.
*   **Removal and/or Replacement of Personnel:** per term 15 in the agreement, SKI or CBI should have intitiated Gilles' removal or replacement if his performance was unsatisfactory or if he habitually neglected his duties prior to his departure from India.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 279, 282, 285 (Termination of Employment):** These articles are central to determining the legality of the dismissal and the available remedies.
*   **Labor Code, Article 103:** Governs the payment of wages and timing thereof.
*   **Solid Development Corporation Workers Association (SDCWA-UWP) v. Solid Development Corporation, G.R. No. 165995, August 14, 2007, 530 SCRA 132; ePacific Global Contact Center, Inc. v. Cabansay, G.R. No. 167345, November 23, 2007, 538 SCRA 498, 513;** These cases were also used to establish that the NLRC had the right jurisdiction.
*   **MAM Realty Devt. Corp. v. NLRC, 314 Phil. 838, 844 (1995):** This case establishes the liability of corporate officers.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of the Agreement Regarding Staff Provision, specifically the division of responsibilities and liabilities between SKI and CBI regarding Gilles' employment.
*   The interpretation of SKI's intentions. SKI's neglect to follow up on Gilies's payment on time may be interpreted that they had malicious intentions.
