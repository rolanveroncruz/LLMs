## Legal Document Summary: *Lumbre v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 160717)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65)

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petitioners’ (Lumbre, et al.) appeal for failure to timely file their Appellant's Brief.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the CA did not commit grave abuse of discretion, dismissing the petition.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Facts:** Private Respondent (Francisco) filed a Quieting of Title case against Petitioners based on his TCT over Lot 7402-D. Petitioners claim ownership based on their respective TCTs over Lot 7571 (allegedly a different property), tracing ownership back to Tomas Lumbre. RTC ruled in favor of Francisco, declaring Petitioners' TCTs null and void.
*   **Procedural History:** Petitioners appealed to the CA. The CA granted a 30-day extension to file the Appellant's Brief, but Petitioners failed to meet the extended deadline. The CA then dismissed the appeal pursuant to Rule 50, Section 1(e) of the Rules of Court.
*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The dismissal was based on a mere technicality and results in a grave miscarriage of justice. They argued for liberal construction of the rules, citing their long occupation of the land and the fact that previous counsel abandoned them.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** Certiorari is an improper remedy as the CA's resolution was final, appealable under Rule 45, and the failure to file a brief was due to counsel's ineffective time management. They invoke Rule 50, Section 1(e) as justification for dismissal.
*   **Supreme Court's Analysis:**
    *   **No Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The CA correctly followed Rule 44, Section 7 (filing of Appellant's brief) and Rule 50, Section 1(e) (dismissal for failure to file brief). The Court cites *Pineda v. Arcalas* and *Enriquez v. Court of Appeals* emphasizing the mandatory nature of an appellant's brief.
    *   **Wrong Remedy:** Certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal. Petitioners should have filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, and failed to meet the 15-day deadline.
    *   **No Right to Appeal:** Appeal is a statutory right, and Petitioners failed to comply with procedural rules.
    *   **Diligence Required:** Cites *Delos Santos v. Elizalde* - diligence required not just from lawyers, but also clients.

**Obligations:** Petitioners had an obligation to file their Appellant's Brief within the prescribed time and to adhere to the Rules of Court, including the timeliness of any motions.

**Liabilities:** Petitioners' failure to comply with procedural rules resulted in the dismissal of their appeal and affirmation of the RTC judgment against them.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Technicality:** While the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of procedural rules, Petitioners argued that the decision hinged on a "technicality" without addressing the substantive issues of land ownership.
*   **"Rehashed Excuses":** The Supreme Court strongly criticized the Petitioners' Counsel, stating that the excuses provided were rehashed, and time-management issues should not justify a reversal.
*   **Equity vs. Procedure:** The decision emphasizes adherence to procedural rules over equitable considerations, particularly regarding potential injustice from the loss of land ownership.
*   **LOT Discrepency** The document mentions discrepencies on the LOT titles of land.
