## Legal Document Summary: *Cabaron v. People*, G.R. No. 156981

**Case:** *Arturo C. Cabaron and Brigida Cabaron v. People of the Philippines and Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 156981, October 5, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Sandiganbayan's decision and resolution convicting Petitioners for violation of Section 7(d) of R.A. No. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Violation:** Section 7(d) of R.A. 6713 - prohibits public officials from soliciting or accepting any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or anything of monetary value from any person, in the course of their official duties or in connection with any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their office.
*   **Accusation:** Arturo Cabaron, an Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, allegedly solicited/demanded P50,000 from Richter Pacifico, mother of a defendant in cases handled by the Prosecutor's Office, in exchange for consolidating cases and providing legal defense. Brigida Cabaron, his wife, was accused of conniving in this act.
*   **Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Found both Petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Initially sentenced to imprisonment, later modified to an indeterminate penalty of 1 year (minimum) to 2 years and 1 day (maximum), plus costs and P30,000 in solidary moral damages to Richter Pacifico.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Imprisonment and costs for both Petitioners.
*   **Civil Liability:** Solidary liability for P30,000 in moral damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court refused to review the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan, particularly the credibility of witnesses. This is a significant hurdle for the Petitioners, as the conviction rested on the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense argued the prosecution witnesses were motivated by malice (Atty. Valencia), but the Sandiganbayan rejected this, finding their testimonies credible. This highlights the difficulty in overturning factual findings based on credibility assessments.
*   **Question of Fact vs. Law:** The Court deemed the issues raised by Petitioners as questions of fact, not law, limiting the scope of review under Rule 45. This restricts the avenues for appeal.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6713, Section 7(d):** The core statutory provision violated.
*   ***Rodriguez v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 63118:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law over Sandiganbayan decisions.
*   ***Republic v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. No. 135789:** Defines the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact.
*    ***Mendoza v. People*, G.R. No. 146234:** Further illustrates the differences between questions of fact and law.
*   ***Arce√±o v. People*, G.R. No. 116098:** Appellate courts typically defer to trial courts on credibility of witnesses.
*   ***Tayaban v. People*, G.R. No. 150194:** Trial courts primarily assess witness credibility.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, upholding the Sandiganbayan's conviction based on the factual findings and credibility assessments. The case highlights the challenges of overturning convictions based on credibility issues and the limited scope of Supreme Court review over Sandiganbayan decisions involving questions of fact. Further review will require demonstrating a clear error of law or abuse of discretion by the Sandiganbayan.
