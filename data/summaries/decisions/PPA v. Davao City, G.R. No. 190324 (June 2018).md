**Case Summary: Philippine Ports Authority v. The City of Davao, G.R. No. 190324 (2018)**

**Legal Issue:** The primary issue is whether the Court of Appeals (CA) had jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief sought by the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) against the City of Davao concerning real property tax assessments and the subsequent auction of PPA properties, and whether PPA engaged in forum shopping.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied PPA's petition, affirming the CA's dismissal of PPA's petition for prohibition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 857:** Created the PPA and empowered it to administer properties.
*   **RA 1125 (as amended by RA 9282):** Defines the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) which includes decisions from the Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA) involving real property tax assessments.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Real Property Tax Liability:** Davao City assessed real property taxes against PPA-administered properties. PPA risks losing these properties due to tax delinquency.
*   **Auction and Sale of Properties:**  Davao City auctioned PPA properties after tax delinquency assessments. The properties were sold to the City of Davao, subject to a redemption period.

**Key Arguments & Rationale:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC held that the CA lacked jurisdiction because the CTA has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over CBAA decisions regarding real property tax assessments (RA 1125, as amended by RA 9282, Sec. 7(a)(5)). PPA should have sought injunctive relief from the CTA.
*   **City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo (2014):** The SC cited this case to underscore the CTA's power to issue writs of certiorari in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, reinforcing the CTA's competence to grant the injunctive relief PPA sought.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The SC upheld the CA's finding that PPA engaged in forum shopping by simultaneously pursuing an appeal before the CTA and a petition for certiorari before the CA, both concerning the same tax liabilities.
*   **PPA's Argument:** PPA argued that the rights asserted (peaceful possession vs. tax exemption) and reliefs sought (temporary injunction vs. final tax exemption) were different, therefore no forum shopping.
*   **SC's Rebuttal:** The SC found that it could not verify the nature of the rights asserted in each court filing, as PPA did not provide copies of these filings with the SC petition.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 857:** (Creation of PPA)
*   **Republic Act No. 1125 (as amended by RA 9282):** (Court of Tax Appeals Act, jurisdiction of CTA)
*   **City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo, 726 Phil. 9 (2014):** (CTA's power to issue writs of certiorari)
*   **Dy v. Yu, 763 Phil. 491 (2015):** (Definition of forum shopping)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **PPA's Tax Exemption:** Although the CTA initially ruled in favor of PPA's tax exemption, the SC did not directly address this issue in this case. The ultimate determination of PPA's tax-exempt status appears to be based on other Supreme Court decisions.
*   **Jurisdiction Dispute:** PPA's argument of urgency to justify CA jurisdiction was dismissed without extensive analysis. The decision emphasizes the statutorily defined jurisdiction of the CTA over the CA.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Properties:** If the tax assessment stands (the CTA ruling can be appealed), PPA risks losing its properties to Davao City due to tax delinquency.
*   **Penalties and Interest:** Potential liability for penalties and interest on the unpaid real property taxes.

**Recommendations:**

*   Monitor and challenge the validity of the real property tax assessments.
*   Consider negotiating a settlement with Davao City to mitigate liabilities.
*   If the CTA decision on tax exemption is appealed, vigorously defend the PPA's tax-exempt status before the relevant court.
