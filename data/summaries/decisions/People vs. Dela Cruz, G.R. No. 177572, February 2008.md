**Case Summary: *People v. Dela Cruz*** (G.R. No. 177572, February 26, 2008)

**Nature:** Review of Court of Appeals decision affirming with modification the RTC conviction of Juanito Dela Cruz for four counts of rape against his daughter, AAA.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Four Informations filed against Dela Cruz for rape committed in March 1995, January-December 1996, January-December 1997, and July 24, 1998. All charges alleged force, threat, and intimidation.
*   **Victim Testimony (AAA):** Detailed account of multiple instances of rape by her father, spanning several years. Claims of force, threats to kill her and family, and fear as reasons for delayed reporting. Witness testimony included direct identification of the accused.
*   **Medico-Legal Report (Dr. Umil):** Examination revealed an intact but distensible hymen, wide orifice, and no evident extra-genital physical injuries.
*   **Accused's Defense (Dela Cruz):** Denied all charges. Contested the authenticity of a letter presented as an admission of guilt and challenged the credibility of the victim's testimony.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Conviction on all four counts of rape. Death penalty imposed for the first two counts (1995, 1996). Reclusion perpetua imposed for the latter two (1997, 1998).
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed conviction but modified the penalty for the first two counts to reclusion perpetua, finding that the victim's minority at the time of the first two rapes was not sufficiently proven.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Dela Cruz):** Liable for four counts of simple rape. Ordered to pay civil indemnity and moral damages for each count.
*  The Supreme Court AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION that appellant is also ordered to pay AAA exemplary damages in the amount of P25,000.00 for each of the four cases.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Victim's Testimony:** The case heavily relies on the victim's testimony. While generally given weight in rape cases, discrepancies (especially related to the presence of other family members) were raised by the defense.
*   **Missing Material Witness:** No testimony was taken from DDD as corroborating witness. The issue of the credibility of the daughter and other relatives are not fully addressed here.
*   **Proof of Minority:** Failure to adequately prove the victim's minority at the time of the initial rapes was a crucial factor in reducing the sentence. This highlights the need for documentary evidence (birth certificate, school records) to prove such elements. *Tabanggay*, *Pruna*, *Tipay*, and *Pecayo*, Sr. are cited on this issue.
*   **Admissibility of Letter:** The letter on the cigarette wrapper was admitted as evidence against the accused. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals finding citing that his admission of such letter serves as sufficient evidence even though he tried to recant such testimony.
*   **Time Specificity:** The validity of the information in the years "January to December" was questioned; citing the lack of specificity of each rape date, it was decided that the information was valid as the main ingredient of the crime of rape is carnal knowledge.
*   **Lack of Physical Evidence:** The absence of physical injuries was addressed by precedent stating that lack of external signs does not negate rape.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by R.A. 7659):** Defines rape and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:** Amended the Revised Penal Code, prescribing the death penalty for rape under certain qualifying circumstances (e.g., victim is a minor).
*  **Republic Act No. 8353**, the statutory rape was penalized under art. 266-A and Art. 266-B.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262, "Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004":** Law relevant to the protection of the privacy of victims and family members by substituting their real names with initials.
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, 7 July 2004, 433 SCRA 640):** Case governing the remand of cases with death penalty to the Court of Appeals for disposition.
*   **Case law regarding the credibility of rape victims:** Emphasizes the weight given to victim testimony, particularly from youthful victims.
*   **Section 27, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence** Admission of guilt.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   This case reaffirms the importance of credible victim testimony in rape cases, but also emphasizes the need for solid corroborating evidence, especially when seeking enhanced penalties based on qualifying circumstances like minority.
*   The admission of the letter, even with later attempts at denial, showcases the significance of initial admissions in criminal proceedings.
*   Focus on establishing the date of the crime.
