**Legal Document Summary - *Spouses Alex and Julie Lam vs. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company* (G.R. No. 178881, February 18, 2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision regarding the issuance of a writ of possession following extrajudicial foreclosure.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Alex and Julie Lam (Mortgagors)
*   **Respondent:** Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (MBTC, Mortgagee/Purchaser)

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Loan and Mortgage:** Spouses Lam obtained a loan from MBTC secured by a real estate mortgage over property covered by TCT No. T-115893. The mortgage was amended for subsequent loans.
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Spouses Lam defaulted on the loan, leading MBTC to initiate extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings under Act No. 3135.
*   **Sale and Consolidation:** MBTC was the sole bidder at the sheriff's sale, a Provisional Certificate of Sale was issued and registered, and upon failure of the Lams to redeem within one year, a Final Certificate of Sale was issued. MBTC consolidated title (TCT No. T-327605).
*   **Writ of Possession:** MBTC filed a complaint for a writ of possession (Other Case No. 097-2001) with the RTC, which initially treated it as an adversarial proceeding. The RTC later reversed course and ruled it ex parte, then reversed again.
*   **Annulment Suit:** The Lams filed a separate action (Civil Case No. 30,216-2004) for specific performance and annulment of the foreclosure sale.
*   **Procedural History:** The RTC flip-flopped on whether the writ of possession proceeding should be ex parte. The CA reversed the RTC, holding the writ of possession is ex parte and the RTC abused its discretion in treating it as adversarial.

**Obligations:**

*   **Spouses Lam:** Obligated to repay the loan, subject to the terms of the mortgage agreements and amendments. Obligation to surrender possession of the property upon MBTC's consolidation of title.
*   **MBTC:** Obligated to follow the procedures for extrajudicial foreclosure outlined in Act No. 3135.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Lam:** Liable for the outstanding loan amount and potentially subject to eviction from the property.
*   **MBTC:** Potential liability if the foreclosure was conducted improperly, which is being contested in the separate annulment suit (Civil Case No. 30,216-2004).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lams:** Loss of property due to foreclosure. Potential for deficiency judgment if the sale proceeds do not cover the entire debt.
*   **MBTC:** Delay in obtaining possession of the property due to the pending annulment suit. Risk that the foreclosure sale will be invalidated, requiring new foreclosure proceedings (or other remedy).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.  Section 7 addresses the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   ***Jetri Construction Corp. v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, G.R. No. 171687, June 8, 2007***:  Reiterates that the issuance of a writ of possession is a ministerial duty after consolidation of title.
*   ***Spouses Norberto Oliveros and Elvira Oliveros v. The Honorable Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 24, Bi√±an, Laguna and Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company, G.R. No. 165963, September 3, 2007***:  Explains the nature of a writ of possession as an ex parte and summary proceeding under Act No. 3135.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document doesn't explicitly identify ambiguous clauses. However, the central point of contention is whether "equitable circumstances" exist that would justify the RTC treating the writ of possession proceedings as adversarial. The petitioners relied on the idea that these exist, while the CA and SC disagreed.

**Key Legal Issues:**

1.  Whether the issuance of a writ of possession in an extrajudicial foreclosure is a ministerial duty, as held in existing jurisprudence, or whether there are exceptions that require adversarial proceedings (This was the core issue, and the SC upheld the ministerial duty).
2.  The impact of a pending annulment suit (Civil Case No. 30,216-2004) on the right of the purchaser (MBTC) to obtain a writ of possession. The SC held the writ of possession can be issued regardless of the annulment case's pendency, without prejudice to its outcome.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA ruling that the writ of possession should be issued to MBTC as a ministerial act.  The pending annulment suit does not prevent the issuance of the writ. The court emphasized that questions regarding the validity of the mortgage or foreclosure should be addressed in the annulment suit, not in the writ of possession proceeding.
