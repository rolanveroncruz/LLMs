## Legal Document Summary: People v. Naquita (G.R. No. 180511)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the conviction of Marilyn Naquita for violation of Sections 5 (sale of dangerous drugs) and 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) of Republic Act No. 9165, the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):**  Accused found guilty of selling 2.05 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). Penalty: Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Accused found guilty of possessing 3.90 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). Original Penalty: Imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years and a fine of P300,000.00, modified by the CA to an indeterminate sentence of 12 years and 1 day (minimum) to 13 years (maximum).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The conviction hinges on the validity of a buy-bust operation conducted by police officers. The prosecution presented PO1 Cosme (poseur-buyer) and PO1 Llanderal as key witnesses.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The decision emphasizes the unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs from the point of seizure to laboratory examination, as demonstrated through markings, proper handling, and forensic testing. The decision cites *People v. Concepcion*, G.R. No. 178876, 27 June 2008 in relation to chain of custody.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court relies on the presumption that police officers acted regularly in the performance of their duties. This is a critical element given the defense of frame-up.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Liable for penalties associated with violating Sec. 5 and Sec. 11 of RA 9165.
*   **Law Enforcement:** Expected to adhere to Section 86 RA 9165 and ensure proper transfer and disposition of cases involving illegal drugs with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Pre-Operation Report & Section 21 Compliance:** The defense argued that the absence of a Pre-Operation and Coordination Report and the failure to comply with the physical inventory and photographing requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165 invalidate the buy-bust operation. The Court addresses this by stating non-compliance does not automatically render the arrest illegal or the evidence inadmissible, emphasizing the integrity of the evidence is the priority.  The decision cites *People v. Sta. Maria,* G.R. No. 171019, 23 February 2007, 516 SCRA 621, 630-632, which emphasized that Section 86 is more of an administrative provision. Also cited is *People v. Del Monte*, G.R. No. 179940, 23 April 2008 in relation to Section 21.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the credibility of the police officers, alleging a frame-up and extortion. The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, noting the opportunity to directly observe demeanor. The court notes that the witnesses presented by the defense were unreliable due to either being closely related to the accused or because they offered inconsistent accounts.
*   **Informant's Testimony:**  The failure to present the confidential informant as a witness was raised as a deficiency. The Court stated informant testimony is not indispensable, particularly when the poseur-buyer testified and in the absense of material inconsistencies, or motive for police officers to falsely testify.
*   **Penalty Discrepancy:** While the penalty for illegal sale conformed to Section 5 and RA 9346 (prohibition of death penalty), ensure the modified penalty from the CA for illegal possession remains compliant with the Indeterminate Sentence Law.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 and 11.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Act Prohibiting the Imposition of the Death Penalty.
*   **Act No. 4103:** Indeterminate Sentence Law.
*   **People v. Sta. Maria, G.R. No. 171019, 23 February 2007, 516 SCRA 621, 630-632:** Re: non-compliance with Section 86 of RA 9165
*   **People v. Del Monte, G.R. No. 179940, 23 April 2008:** Re: non-compliance with Section 21.
*   **People v. Concepcion, G.R. No. 178876, 27 June 2008:** Re: Chain of Custody.
*   **People v. Evangelista, G.R. No. 175281, 27 September 2007, 534 SCRA 241, 250** Re: Credibility of witnesses.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' conviction based primarily on the prosecution's evidence, particularly the testimony of the police officers involved in the buy-bust operation. The Court gave significant weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and upheld the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. The defense of frame-up was rejected due to a lack of clear and convincing evidence.
