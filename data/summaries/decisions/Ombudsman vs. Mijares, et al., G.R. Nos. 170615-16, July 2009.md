## Legal Document Summary: *Republic vs. Mijares, et al.* (G.R. NOS. 170615-16)

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the Ombudsman's finding of grave misconduct against respondents (Mayor Ferrera, Commissioner Mijares, Engr. Querubin, and Brgy. Chairman Ruba). The case stemmed from the demolition of houses and improvements built by members of the SPFMPCI on PHILCOMSAT land in Baras, Rizal. The Ombudsman initially held the respondents liable for grave misconduct, ordering their dismissal and forfeiture of benefits. The CA reversed, ordering reinstatement and backwages for Mijares, Querubin, and Ruba.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Applicability of Laws:** The Supreme Court held that neither RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act) nor PD 1096 (National Building Code) was the governing law in this case. Instead, Presidential Decrees 1845 and 1848, which established the area around the Philippine Space Communications Center as a security zone under the jurisdiction of the Department of National Defense, took precedence.
*   **Legality of Demolition:** Because the SPFMPCI members occupied the land without the permission of the Secretary of National Defense, and they were not legitimate farmer-beneficiaries per MARO/PARO records, the demolition was deemed lawful under PD 1845/1848. The Court considered it reasonable to protect the communications facility from illegal squatters, even recognizing their designation as "professional squatters" (as suggested by the Ombudsman in previous criminal proceedings).
*   **Grave Misconduct:** The Court found no evidence of corruption, intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules. It considered the respondent's attempt to identify affected settlers (evidenced by the presented list) as demonstrating an absence of ill motive. Therefore, no grave misconduct found.
*   **Reinstatement & Backwages:** The CA's order for reinstatement and backwages for Mijares, Querubin, and Ruba was upheld. Note that the Supreme Court did not grant backwages and benefits for Mayor Ferrera, as he was no longer in office.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **No Liability:** The respondents were relieved of any administrative liability.
*   **Reinstatement Obligation:** The government is obligated to reinstate Mijares and Querubin to their former positions.
*   **Payment Obligation:** The government is obligated to pay backwages and other benefits to Mijares, Querubin and Ruba.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Professional Squatter" Designation:** The Court refers to the Ombudsman's designation of the SPFMPCI members as "professional squatters" in a related criminal case. However, whether or not this designation fully adheres to the definition under RA 7279 (and subsequent case law interpreting it) is not explicitly determined within this decision. This ambiguity could create future challenges or related liability.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** While the court emphasizes the absence of evidence of malicious intent, the lack of clear procedural steps taken to identify legal occupants of the land before demolition could raise potential future challenges regarding due process.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **RA 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act):** Considered, but deemed inapplicable.
*   **PD 1096 (National Building Code):** Considered, but deemed inapplicable.
*   **PD 1845 and 1848 (Security Zone Declarations):** Controlling statutes in this case.
*   **Sec. 25 of Republic Act No. 6770, (Ombudsman Act of 1989)** Used by Ombudsman to find Grave Misconduct, which was reversed in this case
*   **Tapiador v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 129124, March 15, 2002, 379 SCRA 322, 329** This cases sets precedent that in administrative proceedings, the complainant has the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, the allegations in the complaint.
