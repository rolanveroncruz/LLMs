## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Nazareno* (G.R. No. 168982)

**Case Overview:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the People of the Philippines seeking to reverse the Sandiganbayan's acquittal of Dir. Gen. Cesar P. Nazareno, et al. (Respondents) for violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), specifically entering into contracts disadvantageous to the government. The charge stemmed from alleged overpricing in the purchase of Caliber .45 Thompson Brand pistols by the PNP from Beltra Industries.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Allegation:** The Respondents, while in office, conspired to enter into contracts for the supply of 5,681 units of Caliber .45 pistols at a total cost of P105,384,254.70, under terms and conditions manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the government.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Presented findings of a special audit team that compared the PNP purchase price to that of the AFP Logistics Command (LOGCOM), concluding the PNP purchase was overpriced by approximately P45 Million.
*   **Defense Argument:** Argued that the AFP's unit price was not a valid basis for comparison, as the AFP purchases were made under the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which provides subsidized rates unavailable to the PNP. Argued lack of conspiracy.
*   **Sandiganbayan Ruling:** Acquitted the Respondents, finding that the AFP prices were insufficient for establishing overpricing due to the FMS program. The Sandiganbayan also criticized the audit team's methodology for lacking an actual canvass of gun prices from different suppliers, citing *Arriola v. Commission on Audit* and *National Center for Mental Health Management v. COA*. They also noted the absence of conspiracy among the accused.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(g):** The specific provision of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act the respondents were accused of violating (entering into contracts disadvantageous to the government).
*   **Arms Export Control Act (AECA):** US Law limiting Foreign Military Sales benefits.

**Case Law Referenced:**

*   **Arriola v. Commission on Audit (G.R. No. 90364, September 30, 1991):** Establishes the requirement of actual canvass of prices to support findings of overpricing.
*   **National Center for Mental Health Management v. COA (G.R. No. 114864, December 6, 1996):** Reinforces the *Arriola* ruling regarding the necessity of price canvassing.
*   **Sajul v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 135294, November 20, 2000):** States that a basis for comparison must be established to support a conclusion of overpricing.
* **People v. Sandiganbayan** (G.R. No. 152532, August 16, 2005):** Addressed that a judgment of acquittal can only be challenged through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
*   **People v. Velasco (G.R. No. 127444, September 13, 2000):** Discusses double jeopardy policy

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The Respondents argued that the petition violates their constitutional right against double jeopardy. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition on this ground.
*   **Evidentiary Standard for Overpricing:** The core contention revolves around the evidentiary standard required to prove overpricing, particularly the necessity of direct price canvassing and the validity of comparing prices from different acquisition programs (FMS vs. direct purchase).
*   **Judicial Notice of Foreign Law:** The People questioned the Sandiganbayan's taking judicial notice of US laws regarding FMS programs. This highlights the procedural requirements for proving foreign law.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The People attempted to characterize the Sandiganbayan's decision as a grave abuse of discretion, which would have allowed a review of the acquittal via certiorari. However, the Court found no such abuse.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court **DENIED** the People's petition, upholding the Sandiganbayan's acquittal based on double jeopardy.
