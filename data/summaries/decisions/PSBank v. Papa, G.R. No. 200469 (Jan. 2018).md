**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Savings Bank v. Josephine L. Papa*, G.R. No. 200469, January 15, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a collection of sum of money case.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Underlying Debt:** Respondent Papa obtained a Flexi-Loan from Petitioner PSB, evidenced by a promissory note.  PSB claims default and seeks recovery of P173,000 plus interest, penalties, and attorney's fees.
*   **Promissory Note:** The core of the dispute revolves around the admissibility and evidentiary weight of a photocopy of the promissory note. The RTC and CA deemed it insufficient to prove the loan's existence and due execution, despite PSB's claims.
*   **Default Clause:** The promissory note allegedly contains clauses regarding interest (38.4% p.a.), late payment charges (3%/month), attorney's fees (25%, min. P5,000), and liquidated damages (10%, min. P1,000). The enforceability of these clauses is contingent on proving the note's validity.
*   **Procedural Issue: Timeliness of Motion for Reconsideration:** The central legal issue is whether PSB's Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC decision was timely filed.  The CA ruled it was *not* because service on Papa was via private courier and PSB failed to provide the required affidavit demonstrating compliance with Rule 13, Section 7 of the Rules of Court (service by ordinary mail). This failure resulted in the RTC decision becoming final and unappealable.
* **Doctrine of Finality of Judgments:** the Court reiterated that judgments or orders become final and executory by operation of law and not by judicial declaration. The Court also emphasized that the bare invocation of the "interest of substantial justice" is not a magic wand that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules.

**Obligations:**

*   **PSB:** Obligated to properly prove the existence and terms of the promissory note and its service in accordance with Rules of Court.
*   **Papa (allegedly):** Obligated to repay the loan amount plus interest, penalties, and fees, if PSB had successfully proven the note and validly perfected its appeal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PSB:**  Liable for costs of suit as the petition was dismissed.
*   **Papa:**  Not currently liable due to the procedural defect in PSB's appeal, regardless of the underlying merits of the debt claim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidence:** The primary risk for PSB was its reliance on a photocopy of the promissory note. The lack of the original and insufficient secondary evidence to prove its execution was fatal. The RTC's initial acceptance of the photocopy by the MeTC was ultimately overturned.
*   **Procedural Rigidity:** The court strictly applied the Rules of Court regarding service of pleadings. PSB's failure to comply with Rule 13, Section 7, even though Papa received the motion, was deemed a critical defect.
*   **Unjust Enrichment Argument:** PSB argues that Papa's non-payment would result in unjust enrichment, but the Court dismissed this claim due to the finality of the RTC judgment based on procedural grounds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13, Sections 7 & 13:** Governing service of pleadings and proof of service.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 15, Section 6:** Regarding motions set for hearing to be accompanied by proof of service thereof to the other parties concerned.
*   The Decision cites cases regarding filing by private courier as equivalent to filing by ordinary mail.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interest rate (38.4% p.a.) and penalty clauses could be subject to legal challenges based on usury or unconscionability, *if* the promissory note had been properly proven. However, this issue was never reached due to the procedural defect.

**Conclusion:**

The case was decided against PSB primarily on procedural grounds. Their failure to properly serve the motion for reconsideration and to adequately demonstrate valid service was fatal to their appeal. The RTC decision, finding a lack of proof of the promissory note's existence and execution, became final. The enforceability of the loan's terms was never fully litigated due to the procedural missteps by PSB. *Industrial Timber Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 303 Phil. 621, 626 (1994) and Philippine National Bank v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 678 Phil. 660, 674 (2011) were cases cited for using private couriers.*
