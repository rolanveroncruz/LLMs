**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Murder, qualified by treachery.
*   **Facts:** Nicandro Abria stabbed Lutgardo Fumar in the chest following a heated exchange initiated by Fernando Abria. The stabbing was fatal, leading to Fumar's death two days later.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Nicandro Abria is criminally liable for murder, as qualified by treachery.
*   **Civil Liability:** Nicandro Abria is civilly liable to the heirs of Lutgardo Fumar for the actual damages and indemnity.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal based on Factual Findings:** The appellant challenged the factual findings of the trial court, including the credibility of the prosecution witness and the rejection of the self-defense claim. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's findings, emphasizing its superior position to assess witness credibility. Further challenges on factual grounds face a high hurdle.
*   **Appeal on Treachery:** The appellant disputed the presence of treachery. The Court found that the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, against an unarmed and unsuspecting victim, constituted treachery, even if the attack was frontal.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **People v. Basadre, 128 SCRA 641 (1984):**  Cited to support the application of treachery to sudden frontal attacks against unarmed victims.
*   **People v. Javar, 226 SCRA 103, 111 (1993):** Supports the finding of treachery in a sudden and unexpected frontal attack against an unarmed victim.
*   **People v. Lacatan, G.R. No. 121532, September 7, 1998:** Reinforces the principle of deference to trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **People v. Villalobos, 209 SCRA 304 (1992):** Supports the credibility of a victim's wife as a witness.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court dismisses the black out claim due to the defendantâ€™s ability to recall aspects of the event.

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court's decision is based on its assessment of the factual findings and its interpretation of the law. The Court found no reason to overturn the trial court's decision.
