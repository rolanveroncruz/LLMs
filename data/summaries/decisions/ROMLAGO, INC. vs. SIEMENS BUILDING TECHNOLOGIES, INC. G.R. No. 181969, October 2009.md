**Case Summary: Romago, Inc. vs. Siemens Building Technologies, Inc. (G.R. No. 181969, October 2, 2009)**

**Subject Matter:** Dispute arising from an Equipment Supply Sub-Contract Agreement (ESSA) between Romago, Inc. (ROMAGO) and Siemens Building Technologies, Inc. (SBTI) for electrical equipment for a construction project. SBTI sought arbitration due to ROMAGO's non-payment. ROMAGO counterclaimed for alleged expenses and damages.

**Key Provisions/Agreements:**

*   **Consortium Agreement:** ROMAGO and SBTI initially agreed to jointly bid for the project.
*   **Equipment Supply Sub-Contract Agreement (ESSA):** SBTI agreed to supply electrical equipment for P100,000,000.00 (later amended to P67,734,457.27). Key obligation was for SBTI to deliver equipment. ROMAGO's obligation was to pay.
*   **Arbitration Clause:** The Consortium Agreement contained a clause for arbitration under the PCCI rules.
*   **Agreement to Submit Dispute to Arbitration:** Signed by ROMAGO's representative agreeing to submit the dispute to PDRCI.
*   **Terms of Reference (TOR) & Amended TOR:** Signed by both parties' counsel and ROMAGO representative, outlining issues for arbitration.

**Arbitration & RTC Proceedings:**

*   **PDRCI Arbitration:** The Arbitrator ruled in favor of SBTI, awarding P16,937,612.68 plus interest, attorney's fees, and arbitration costs.
*   **RTC Confirmation:** SBTI filed for confirmation of the award. ROMAGO opposed, alleging arbitrator bias. The RTC confirmed the award, finding ROMAGO failed to file a timely motion to vacate under Section 26 of the Arbitration Law (RA 876).
*   **Petition for Relief:** ROMAGO sought relief from judgment due to alleged negligence of counsel (failure to appeal). RTC denied.

**CA Decision:**

*   Affirmed RTC decision. Held the contract was a supply contract, not a construction contract, thus CIAC jurisdiction was not applicable.
*   ROMAGO estopped from challenging PDRCI jurisdiction due to active participation in the proceedings.
*   Upheld denial of petition for relief; counsel's negligence binds the client.

**Supreme Court Ruling**
* Upheld CA Decision. Petition Denied.
* Upheld PDRCI ruling and jurisdiction since the original contract was a supply contract and not a construction contract.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **ROMAGO:** Obligated to pay SBTI for delivered equipment. Held liable for P16,937,612.68, interest, attorney's fees, and arbitration costs.
*   **SBTI:** Obligated to deliver equipment as per the ESSA. Deemed to have fulfilled obligations.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** ROMAGO unsuccessfully argued that the contract was a construction contract, falling under CIAC's jurisdiction. This argument hinges on the interpretation of "construction" as defined in EO 1008 and relevant case law.
*   **Timeliness of Motion to Vacate:** ROMAGO failed to file a timely motion to vacate the arbitration award, a critical point under Section 26 of the Arbitration Law (RA 876). The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of adhering to this deadline.
*   **Counsel's Negligence:** ROMAGO's reliance on counsel's negligence for relief was rejected, as courts generally hold clients responsible for their attorneys' actions (Insular Life Savings and Trust Company v. Runes, Jr). There is a high bar for excusing negligence.
*   **Estoppel:** ROMAGO's active participation in arbitration proceedings likely contributed to the estoppel argument against it. *Tijam, etal. v. Sibonghanoy, et al*
*   **Petition for relief:** Relief under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, being an equitable remedy, is allowed only in exceptional cases, as when there is no other available or adequate remedy

**Key Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Executive Order No. 1008:** Defines CIAC's jurisdiction.
*   **Republic Act No. 876 (Arbitration Law):** Governs arbitration proceedings and the confirmation/vacation of awards, particularly Section 26 regarding the time limit for motions to vacate.
*   **Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Manuel M. Domingo:** defines the word construction.
*   **Reyes v. Balde II:** Holds that arbitral clause in the agreement is a commitment by the parties to submit to arbitration the disputes covered therein.
*   **Figueroa v. People** and **Apolonia Banayad Frianela v. Servillano Banayad, Jr.** that estoppel by laches supervenes in exceptional cases similar to the factual milieu in Tijam v. Sibonghanoy.
*   **Dela Cruz v. Andres** Holds that Under Rule 38 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, it may be availed of only after a judgment, final order or other proceedings were taken against petitioner in any court through fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence
*   **Fukuzumi v. Sanritsu Great International Corporation** That a party is not entitled to relief under Rule 38, Section 2, of the Rules of Court if he was not prevented from filing his notice of appeal by fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence.
*   **Insular Life Savings and Trust Company v. Runes, Jr.** Holds that clients are bound by the mistakes, negligence and omission of their counsel.
*   **Azucena v. Foreign Manpower Services** Exceptions to a client being excusable from the failure of counsel

**Analysis and Advice:**

ROMAGO faced an uphill battle due to its failure to file a timely motion to vacate the arbitration award and its active participation in the proceedings. The Supreme Court's emphasis on estoppel and the binding nature of counsel's actions significantly weakened ROMAGO's position. Future actions would likely be futile given the finality of the ruling.
