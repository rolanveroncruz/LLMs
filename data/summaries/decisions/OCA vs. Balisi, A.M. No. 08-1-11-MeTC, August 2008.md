**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 08-1-11-MeTC**

**Case:** Office of the Court Administrator vs. Myrene C. Balisi

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** August 11, 2008

**Nature of Document:** Resolution in an administrative matter regarding habitual tardiness.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** Myrene C. Balisi, Court Stenographer II, MeTC, Branch 29, Manila, was found to be habitually tardy (11 times in February and 14 times in April 2007).
*   **Respondent's Explanation:** Respondent claimed her tardiness was due to childcare responsibilities for her 5-year-old daughter after the nanny left.
*   **OCA's Recommendation:** Reprimand and warning for habitual tardiness.

**Statutory and Jurisprudential References:**

*   **CSC Memorandum Circular No. 04, Series of 1991:** Defines habitual tardiness as being tardy ten (10) times a month for at least two (2) months in a semester or for at least two (2) consecutive months.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 2-99:** Reiterates the policy on absenteeism and tardiness.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 14-2002:** Further reiteration of policy on absenteeism and tardiness.
*   **Section 52(c)(4), Rule VI of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1999:** Sets out the penalties for habitual tardiness (reprimand for the first offense).
*   **Case Law:** The Court cited previous cases (e.g., A.M. No. 00-6-09-SC; 393 SCRA 9 (2002)) establishing that non-office obligations (e.g., domestic concerns) are insufficient justification for habitual tardiness.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Balisi had an obligation to adhere to prescribed office hours.
*   Balisi was found liable for habitual tardiness.

**Potential Risks:**

*   A repetition of tardiness will result in more severe penalties (suspension or dismissal).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the definition of "habitual tardiness" is clear under CSC guidelines, the tolerance for valid excuses is narrow. The respondent's childcare responsibilities were not considered a valid justification.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the OCA's recommendation. Balisi was found guilty of habitual tardiness and reprimanded, with a warning against future violations. The case reinforces the strict standard of conduct for judiciary employees regarding punctuality and adherence to official time, emphasizing that personal obligations are generally not a valid defense against habitual tardiness.
