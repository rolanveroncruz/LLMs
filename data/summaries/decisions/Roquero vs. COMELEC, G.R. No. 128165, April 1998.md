## Legal Document Summary: Roquero v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 128165

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court regarding a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition challenging a COMELEC Resolution related to an election protest.

**Key Issue:** Whether the election protest filed by Reynaldo Villano against Eduardo Roquero was filed within the ten-day reglementary period stipulated in Section 251 of the Omnibus Election Code.

**Summary of Facts:**

*   Roquero and Villano were candidates for Mayor of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan in the 1995 elections.
*   Roquero was proclaimed winner on July 19, 1995.
*   Villano filed a Motion for Reconsideration with COMELEC on July 24, 1995, challenging Roquero's proclamation.
*   COMELEC denied the Motion for Reconsideration on September 8, 1995.
*   Villano filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Supreme Court assailing the COMELEC denial.
*   Supreme Court dismissed the Petition for Certiorari and denied reconsideration, with Villano receiving the denial on May 7, 1996.
*   Villano filed an election protest with the RTC on May 17, 1996.
*   Roquero moved to dismiss, arguing the protest was filed out of time and failed to state a cause of action.
*   The RTC denied Roquero's motion.
*   Roquero filed a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with COMELEC, which was denied.
*   Roquero then filed the instant petition with the Supreme Court.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 251 of the Omnibus Election Code:** Mandates that an election protest for municipal office must be filed within ten (10) days after proclamation.
*   **Section 248 of the Omnibus Election Code:**  The filing of a petition to annul or suspend the proclamation shall suspend the running of the period within which to file an election protest.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, finding that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in denying Roquero's petition for certiorari and prohibition. The Court HELD that Villano's election protest was filed *out of time*.

**Reasoning:**

*   The ten-day period to file the election protest began on July 19, 1995, with Roquero's proclamation.
*   The filing of Villano's Motion for Reconsideration with the COMELEC on July 24, 1995, suspended the running of the period *only* if it specifically sought to annul the proclamation.
*   The Supreme Court applied Section 248 of the Omnibus Election Code.
*   After the Supreme Court denied Villano's motion for reconsideration on May 7, 1996, the remaining five (5) days of the reglementary period resumed, expiring on May 12, 1996.
*   Because Villano filed the election protest on May 17, 1996, it was filed five (5) days late.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Jurisdiction:** Filing an election protest beyond the ten-day period deprives the court of jurisdiction. *Asuncion v. Segundo, Robes v. COMELEC, Conui-Omega v. Samson*.
*   **Non-Compliance:** Violation of the ten-day rule is not a mere technicality; it is an essential requirement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (Section 248, Section 251)** - Statutory basis for the filing period and suspension of the period.
*   **Asuncion v. Segundo, 124 SCRA 729 [1983]; Robes v. COMELEC, 123 SCRA 193 [1983]; Conui-Omega v. Samson, 9 SCRA 493 [1963]**- Jurisprudence emphasizing the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the ten-day filing period.
*   **Lim vs. COMELEC, Kho vs. COMELEC**- Reinforces the jurisdictional requirement to file within the prescribed period.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Whether Villano's Motion for Reconsideration with COMELEC (July 24, 1995) was a petition to annul the proclamation and thus suspend the running of the period. The Court did not find this to be the case based on the facts.

**Implications:**

The decision underscores the strict application of the ten-day rule for filing election protests, emphasizing that it is a jurisdictional requirement. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to statutory deadlines in election law matters.
