**Legal Document Summary**

This is a resolution regarding an administrative matter (A.M. NO. P-06-2121) stemming from an in-house financial audit of Khalil B. Dipatuan, Clerk of Court VI, RTC-Malabang, Lanao del Sur, covering January 1, 2002 - October 31, 2003.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Audit Findings:** While Dipatuan had slight over-remittances in the General, Sheriff's General, and Judiciary Development Funds, the audit revealed violations of accounting procedures. Notably, the OCA found that Dipatuan violated Section 21 of the New Government Accounting System (NGAS) and Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 regarding timely deposits of collections.
*   **Fiduciary Fund Mismanagement:** Dipatuan deposited personal, postdated checks into the court's Fiduciary Fund account, effectively using court funds for personal check encashment, a direct violation of Administrative Circular No. 3-2000.
*   **Neglect of Duty:** The Supreme Court agreed with the OCA that Dipatuan's actions constituted neglect of duty.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty to deposit collections daily or the next banking day per NGAS Section 21.
*   Duty to deposit Judiciary Development Fund collections as required by Administrative Circular No. 3-2000.
*   Duty to avoid using collections for personal check encashment per Administrative Circular No. 3-2000.
*   Adherence to Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5-93 regarding court fund administration, including immediate deposit of fiduciary collections and proper reporting procedures.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found guilty of simple neglect of duty.

**Penalty:**

*   Fined P5,000.00, to be deducted from his terminal leave pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 21 of the New Government Accounting System (NGAS):** Mandates daily deposit of collections.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 3-2000:** Outlines specific rules for the Judiciary Development Fund and prohibits check encashment from collections.
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 5-93:** Governs the proper administration of court funds, emphasizing immediate deposit of fiduciary collections.
*   **Soria v. Oliveros, A.M. No. P-00-1372, May 16, 2005, 458 SCRA 410:** Highlights the vital role of Clerks of Court and their responsibility for court funds.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   While the over-remittances could be seen as mitigating, the court emphasized that full payment does not exempt an officer from liability for delays and procedural violations.
*   The finding of "simple neglect of duty" is based on the combined violations, including the improper handling of the Fiduciary Fund and the delays in remitting collections. While this is Dipatuan's first offense, it's possible that the severity could have warranted a harsher penalty had he not already retired.

**Concise Legal Assessment:**

Dipatuan's actions, particularly the use of the Fiduciary Fund for personal check encashment and delays in remittances, clearly violated established administrative circulars and accounting procedures, justifying the finding of simple neglect of duty and the imposition of a fine. The resolution reinforces the strict accountability expected of Clerks of Court in managing judicial funds, regardless of whether there is an ultimate shortage.
