# Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Economic Zone Authority v. Edison (Bataan) Cogeneration Corporation*, G.R. No. 179537

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's order compelling PEZA to submit to arbitration with Edison (Bataan) Cogeneration Corporation, pursuant to their Power Supply and Purchase Agreement (PSPA). The core dispute concerns Edison's claim of a tariff increase entitlement and PEZA's alleged breach of the agreement, leading to Edison's termination and demand for a pre-termination fee. PEZA refused arbitration, leading to Edison's action for specific performance to compel arbitration.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PSPA (Power Supply and Purchase Agreement):** Establishes a 10-year agreement (effective Oct 25, 1997) for Edison to supply electricity to PEZA for resale to businesses within the Bataan Economic Processing Zone.
*   **Clause 4.9 (Preferential Treatment):** Prohibits PEZA from granting preferential treatment to other power suppliers. Respondent alleges violation of this clause.
*   **Clauses 14.1 & 14.2 (Arbitration Clause):** Mandates dispute resolution through arbitration before a three-member arbitration committee. Each party appoints one representative, and a third mutually acceptable member serves as chairman.

**Liabilities & Claims:**

*   **Edison's Claim:** Entitlement to tariff increases with a mechanism for fuel and lubricating oil cost adjustments, a right to terminate the agreement due to PEZA's alleged breach of Clause 4.9, and a pre-termination fee of P708,691,543.00
*   **PEZA's Defense:**  Disputes Edison's right to terminate, argues the pre-termination fee clause is "gravely onerous, unconscionable, greatly disadvantageous to the government, against public policy, and therefore invalid and unenforceable" (raised in their Answer).
* Edison's alleged breach of contract by whimsical pre-termination and failure to provide necessary data for tariff rate adjustments.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Pre-Termination Fee Clause:** PEZA directly challenges the enforceability of this clause. The arbitral tribunal's determination on this issue will be crucial, specifically if the tribunal decides in favor of Edison.
*   **Whimsical Termination:** PEZA has raised the issue of Edison's bad faith and has alleged Edison has terminated the agreement for reasons outside the spirit of the agreement.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 876 (The Arbitration Law):** Section 6 dictates the court’s authority to order parties to proceed with arbitration when an agreement exists, unless the agreement’s making or a default under it is in issue. Section 8 provides for court appointment of arbitrators if a party fails to nominate one.
*   ***Gonzales v. Climax Mining Ltd.*, G.R. No. 167994:** Initially stated that the validity of the underlying contract affects the arbitration clause's applicability. However, this ruling was later modified.  The court clarified that repudiation of the main contract is insufficient to avoid arbitration. The *separability doctrine* holds that the arbitration agreement is independent of the main contract and survives its invalidity.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of Preferential Treatment (Clause 4.9):** The specific criteria for determining whether PEZA granted preferential treatment to other power suppliers will likely be a point of contention during arbitration.
*   **Trigger for Termination:**  The conditions under which Edison can rightfully terminate the PSPA (outside of PEZA's alleged breach of Clause 4.9) are not fully elaborated in the provided document but will be central to the arbitral tribunal's decision.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court appropriately compelled arbitration given the valid arbitration clause in the PSPA and the presence of a dispute. The arbitral tribunal will now address the merits of Edison's claim and the validity of the pre-termination fee clause, a key point of contention raised by PEZA. The separability doctrine from *Gonzales v. Climax Mining* is central to the court's decision.
