**Case Summary: *Ret. Judge Virgilio Alpajora v. Atty. Ronaldo Antonio V. Calayan*, A.C. No. 8208, January 10, 2018**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Calayan stemming from a counter-complaint filed by Ret. Judge Alpajora.  The original complaint by Calayan against Alpajora was dismissed as judicial in nature.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Complainant's Allegations:** Judge Alpajora alleges that Atty. Calayan filed a malicious and harassing administrative case, made dishonest allegations in pleadings, misquoted provisions of law, and misrepresented facts. Specifically, Calayan is accused of:
    *   Filing multiple baseless/frivolous civil/criminal cases to harass opposing parties (including opposing counsel and judges in Civil Case No. 2007-10).
    *   Filing multiple actions arising from the same cause of action (splitting causes of action).
    *   Filing 18 repetitious pleadings.
    *   Misquoting CJ Davide's opinion.
    *   Attributing unsubstantiated ill-motives to Judge Alpajora, claiming partiality, coaching of opposing counsel, and antedating of orders.

*   **Respondent's Defenses:** Atty. Calayan argues:
    *   *Res judicata* bars the counter-complaint, as the OCA found his original complaint to be judicial in nature.
    *   The counter-complaint is unverified and improper, effectively an end-around disciplinary measures.
    *   Judge Alpajora himself engaged in unethical conduct (delaying pre-trial, misquoting law, etc.)

**Statutory References & Rules:**

*   **Rule 138, Section 20, Rules of Court:** Duties of Attorneys, specifically subsections (b) observing respect for courts and judicial officers, and (d) employing truthful and honorable means.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):**
    *   **Canon 1:** Upholding the Constitution and laws.
    *   **Canon 8, Rule 8.01:** Avoiding abusive or offensive language.
    *   **Canon 10, Rules 10.01, 10.02, 10.03:** Prohibiting falsehoods, misrepresentation, and misuse of rules of procedure.
    *   **Canon 11, Rules 11.03, 11.04:** Respect for courts and judicial officers, not attributing unsupported motives.
    *   **Canon 12, Rules 12.02, 12.04:** Speedy administration of justice, avoiding multiple actions and undue delay.
*   **Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies**: Used (and allegedly misused) by Calayan regarding the creation of a management committee.
*   **Rule 71, Section 3, Rules of Court**: Indirect Contempt.

**Case Law:**

*   ***In Re: Almacen* (142 Phil. 353 (1970)):**  Addresses the right of lawyers to criticize courts, subject to conditions of propriety and good faith. Calayan misinterprets *Almacen* to justify his criticisms.
*   ***Cortes vs. Bangalan* (379 Phil. 251 (2000)):** Deals with contempt powers of a court. Calayan misrepresents this case to support his position.

**Findings and Recommendations:**

*   The IBP Investigating Commissioner found Atty. Calayan in violation of Rule 138, Section 20 of the Rules of Court and various Canons and Rules of the CPR and recommended a two-year suspension.  The IBP Board of Governors adopted the recommendation.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court adopted the IBP's findings. Atty. Calayan is found **GUILTY** of violating The Lawyer's Oath and The Code of Professional Responsibility and is **SUSPENDED from the practice of law for two (2) years.**

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Professional Discipline:** Atty. Calayan is subject to a two-year suspension from the practice of law.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The ruling reflects negatively on Atty. Calayan's professional reputation.
*   **Potential for Future Sanctions:** A stern warning was issued, meaning further similar offenses could result in more severe penalties (e.g., disbarment).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses and Issues:**

*   **Scope of Lawyer's Zealous Advocacy:** The case highlights the tension between a lawyer's duty to zealously represent a client and the ethical obligation to maintain respect for the courts and opposing counsel.  Atty. Calayan's actions are deemed to have crossed the line.
*   **Application of *Res Judicata*:** Calayan's argument that the dismissal of the original administrative complaint against Judge Alpajora bars the counter-complaint based on *res judicata* is rejected.  The dismissal was on judicial grounds, not on the merits of Calayan's conduct as an attorney.
*   **Interpretation of "May" in the Interim Rules:**  Calayan attempts to construe "may" as "exclusively," an interpretation rejected by the Court.

**Potential Issues for Further Review (If Appealed):**

*   Atty. Calayan's understanding and application of the law on intra-corporate disputes.
*   The Court's reliance on inferences of malice based on the number of cases filed. While a high volume of cases can raise concerns, proving actual malice requires stronger evidence.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court affirmed the suspension of Atty. Calayan, finding that his actions constituted harassment of opposing parties and disrespect for the judiciary, violating his ethical obligations as a lawyer.
