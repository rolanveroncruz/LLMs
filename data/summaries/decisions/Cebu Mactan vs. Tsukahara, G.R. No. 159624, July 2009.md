**Case Summary: Cebu Mactan Members Center, Inc. vs. Masahiro Tsukahara, G.R. No. 159624 (2009)**

**Facts:**

*   Tsukahara (Respondent) extended two loans to Cebu Mactan Members Center, Inc. (CMMCI, Petitioner):
    *   P6,500,000 secured by postdated checks (dishonored).
    *   P10,000,000 evidenced by a promissory note signed by CMMCI President Sugimoto, in his capacity as President and in his personal capacity.
*   CMMCI denied corporate liability, arguing the loans were personal to Sugimoto and lacked board resolutions.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Tsukahara, holding CMMCI and Sugimoto jointly and severally liable.
*   Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision.

**Issue:**

*   Whether CMMCI is liable for loans contracted by its president (Sugimoto) without a board resolution.

**Holding:**

*   Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding CMMCI liable.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Corporation Code, Section 23:** Generally, corporate powers are exercised by the Board of Directors.
*   **Exception to General Rule:** The Board can delegate powers to officers, committees, or agents.
*   **Corporate By-Laws (Article III, Section 2):** CMMCI's by-laws expressly granted the President the power to:
    *   Borrow money for the company "by any legal means whatsoever."
    *   Execute contracts and agreements.
    *   Sign checks and promissory notes on behalf of the corporation.
*   **Ruling:**  The Supreme Court relied on the express powers granted to the President in CMMCI's by-laws.  No separate board resolution was necessary to bind the corporation. The corporation is estopped from denying the President's authority given the express grant in the by-laws.
*   **People's Aircargo and Warehousing Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals (357 Phil. 850):** reiterated the principle of delegation and apparent authority of a corporate officer.
*   Reference was made to De Leon, *The Corporation Code of the Philippines (1997), p. 425* regarding the binding nature of corporate bylaws

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   CMMCI is jointly and severally liable with Sugimoto (although Sugimoto was declared in default and served by publication) for:
    *   P6,500,000 with legal interest from the filing of the amended complaint.
    *   P10,000,000 with 18% interest per annum from April 13, 1994.
    *   P150,000 as attorney's fees and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability:** While CMMCI is primarily liable, the joint and several nature of the liability means Tsukahara can pursue either CMMCI or Sugimoto for the full amount. The service on Sugimoto by publication raises potential due process concerns; however, the Supreme Court did not directly address the validity of the default judgment against him in this decision.
*   **Interest Rate:** The 18% interest on the P10,000,000 loan should be scrutinized to determine if it is usurious under applicable usury laws (if still applicable during that time).
*   **Service of Summons by publication:** The validity of the service of summons to Sugimoto by publication should be questioned.

**Key Takeaways for Lawyer:**

This case reinforces the importance of well-drafted corporate by-laws and the scope of authority granted to corporate officers. It also highlights the risk to a corporation when it grants broad powers to an officer, particularly the President, without strict oversight or requirement for board resolutions on specific transactions, particularly high value loans. When structuring loan agreements with corporations, it is important to conduct thorough due diligence by reviewing the company bylaws and corporate resolutions.
