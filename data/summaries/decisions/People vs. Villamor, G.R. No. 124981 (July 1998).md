## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Villamor* (G.R. No. 124981)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Frederick Villamor of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for the shooting death of Reynold Brown. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** Villamor was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, qualified by treachery.
*   **Self-Defense Rejected:** Villamor's claim of self-defense was rejected due to failure to prove unlawful aggression by the victim. The court emphasized the lack of evidence supporting the existence of a Batangas knife and any injuries sustained by Villamor.
*   **Treachery Established:** The Court found the killing was committed with treachery, as the attack on the unarmed victim was sudden, unprovoked, and unexpected, ensuring execution without risk to Villamor.
*   **Evident Premeditation Not Proven:** The Court disagreed with the trial court's finding of evident premeditation, stating there was no concrete evidence demonstrating a deliberate plan.

**Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Villamor is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **Civil Liability:** Villamor is obligated to pay the victim's parents:
    *   P50,000.00 as indemnity for death
    *   P25,000.00 as funeral expenses
    *   P10,000.00 as moral damages
*   Obligated to pay the costs

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:** Principal in the crime of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Civil:** Monetary damages to the victim's family.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense challenged the credibility of the prosecution witnesses due to their close friendship with the victim, but this argument was rejected.
*   **Missing Evidence:** The lack of a recovered weapon (alleged Batangas knife) and medical evidence of Villamor's injuries significantly weakened his self-defense claim.
*   **Flight as Evidence of Guilt:** The court cited Villamor's flight from the scene as evidence of guilt, potentially raising questions about its weight and the possibility of alternative explanations.
*   **Uncorroborated Testimony:** Villamor's account of the events was largely uncorroborated, especially regarding the victim's alleged aggression.
