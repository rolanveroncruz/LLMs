**Legal Document Summary: _National Union of Workers in Hotels, Restaurants and Allied Industries (NUWHRAIN) vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and The Peninsula Manila_ (G.R. No. 125561, March 6, 1998)**

**Case Summary:**

This case involves a special civil action for certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision that declared a strike by the National Union of Workers in Hotels, Restaurants and Allied Industries (NUWHRAIN) – The Peninsula Manila Chapter (Interim Union Junta) illegal and upheld the dismissal of its 15 officers. The strike was staged due to the dismissal of a Junta officer and alleged unfair labor practices (ULP) by The Peninsula Manila Hotel.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegality of Strike:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the NLRC's ruling that the strike was illegal because it was not based on valid grounds, particularly ULP. The NCMB had previously dismissed the Junta's notices of strike, finding the alleged acts of discrimination to be "non-strikeable."

*   **Good Faith Exception:** The SC addressed the "good faith" exception, which permits a strike if employees genuinely believe in the existence of ULP. However, the Court emphasized that a mere claim of good faith is insufficient; the circumstances must warrant such belief. The SC found the circumstances did not reasonably create a belief in ULP, especially considering alternative remedies like filing an illegal dismissal case or submitting to grievance procedures.

*   **Dismissal of Junta Officers:** The SC upheld the dismissal of the 15 Junta officers who participated in the illegal strike. An employer may lawfully discharge employees for participating in an unjustifiable wildcat strike and especially so in this case, because said wildcat strike was an attempt to undermine the Union’s position as the exclusive bargaining representative and was, therefore, an unprotected activity.

*   **Remand to Labor Arbiter:** The case was remanded to the Labor Arbiter for further proceedings regarding the 153 Junta members who participated in the strike.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Union:** Obligated to comply with NCMB orders prohibiting strikes when ULP allegations are deemed "non-strikeable." Liable for staging an illegal strike.
*   **Hotel:** Obligated to follow legal procedures regarding employee discipline and dismissal.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Labor Code (as amended):** Art. 217 (Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters), Art. 260 (Grievance Machinery and Voluntary Arbitration).
*   **Case Law:**
    *   _Panay Electric Co., Inc. vs. NLRC_ (G.R. No. 102672, October 4, 1995): Discusses the "good faith" exception to illegal strikes.
    *   _Master Iron Labor Union vs. NLRC_ (G.R. No. 92009, February 17, 1993): Addresses strikes grounded on ULP.
    *   _People’s Industrial and Commercial Employees and Workers Organization (FFW), et al., vs. People’s Industrial and Commercial Corporation_: Discusses the concept of good faith as a basis to strike.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Good Faith":** The case highlights the subjective nature of "good faith" and the risk of differing interpretations.  A union's belief in ULP must be reasonable and supported by the circumstances.
*   **Remand for 153 Members:** The remand suggests potential individual liability and further litigation regarding the actions of the 153 striking members. The standards of proof for individual culpability during the strike will be crucial.
*   **Dissenting Opinion:** The reliance of the petitioners on a dissenting opinion suggests that the issues were contentious. A dissenting opinion has no binding effect.
