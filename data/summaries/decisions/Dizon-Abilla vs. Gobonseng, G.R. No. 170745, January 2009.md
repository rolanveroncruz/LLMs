## Legal Document Summary: *Dizon-Abilla v. Gobonseng*, G.R. No. 170745 (2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision denying Petition for Review on Certiorari.

**Key Issue:** Whether Petitioners (original vendors) are entitled to additional payments beyond the amount deposited by Respondents (original vendees) for repurchase of property, after the Supreme Court previously ruled the transaction was a *pacto de retro* sale and allowed repurchase under Article 1606 of the Civil Code.

**Background:**

*   Respondents obtained a loan from Petitioners, secured by a Deed of Sale with option to buy back seventeen lots.
*   Petitioners sued for specific performance after Respondents failed to exercise the option. The trial court ruled the option void but awarded damages for expenses related to the deed of sale.
*   The Court of Appeals affirmed, deleting attorney's fees.
*   Respondents then filed a Motion to Repurchase, invoking Article 1606 (right to repurchase within 30 days of final judgment declaring a *pacto de retro* sale).
*   SC in G.R. No. 146651 ruled that the transaction was a *pacto de retro* sale and allowed repurchase based on the Respondents' honest belief that the original agreement was an equitable mortgage.
*   Petitioners subsequently filed a motion arguing they were entitled to additional payments beyond the original deposit.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 1606, Civil Code:** Vendor's right to repurchase within 30 days of final judgment declaring the transaction as *pacto de retro* if the vendor believed it was a mortgage.
*   **Original Deed of Sale:** Stipulated that respondents (original vendors) would shoulder expenses for preparation and registration, capital gains, transfer and documentary stamps taxes.
*   **SC Decision in G.R. No. 146651:** Ordered Petitioners to accept the payment tendered by the respondents and execute the necessary deed of sale conveying the subject lots to respondents. This previous decision is central to the current dispute and bars further claims by Petitioners.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents' liability is limited to the repurchase price tendered and already determined by the court. The lower court authorized the release to the petitioners of the deposit made.
*   Petitioners are obligated to execute the Deed of Sale.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Petitioners:** Continued litigation could result in further sanctions.
*   **For Respondents:** Difficulty in gaining clear title if the Petitioners continue to refuse to execute the deed of sale, requiring further enforcement actions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1606, Civil Code:** Crucial for understanding the basis of Respondents' right to repurchase.
*   ***Ngo Bun Tiong v. Sayo*, L-45825, 163 SCRA 237 (1988):** Cited by the SC regarding the finality of judgments and preventing endless litigation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original Deed of Sale provision regarding expense allocation could have been interpreted as extending beyond the original agreement, however, the prior Supreme Court decision and subsequent proceedings foreclose further claims related to the original debt.
*   Petitioners attempted to argue that the depreciation of the peso, increase in lot value, and other expenses should be factored into the repurchase price, but the court rejected this argument.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court denied the Petition, holding that the amount tendered by the Respondents for repurchase, as previously determined by the Court of Appeals, was final. Petitioners' attempt to claim additional amounts (interest, increased property value, etc.) was rejected. The core issue revolved around the finality of the SCâ€™s prior decision allowing repurchase under Article 1606, based on the Respondents' reasonable belief that the original transaction was an equitable mortgage. The Court emphasized the importance of concluding litigation and preventing repeated attempts to relitigate adjudicated rights.
