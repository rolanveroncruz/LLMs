**Case Summary: Christian General Assembly, Inc. vs. Sps. Ignacio, G.R. No. 164789, August 27, 2009**

**Issue:** Whether the RTC or HLURB has jurisdiction over an action to rescind a Contract to Sell a subdivision lot based on the buyer's claim of fraudulent concealment regarding litigation affecting the property.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) held that the HLURB has exclusive jurisdiction. The CA decision dismissing the CGA complaint for lack of jurisdiction was affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** CGA agreed to purchase a subdivision lot from Sps. Ignacio (owners/developers) on installment basis.
*   **Alleged Concealment:** CGA claims Sps. Ignacio fraudulently concealed that the property was subject to litigation related to land reform (PD No. 27, RA No. 6657) involving former tenant-beneficiaries.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **CGA's Claim:** CGA seeks rescission of the contract, restitution of payments made (P2,515,899.20), and damages based on Article 1381 of the Civil Code (rescissible contracts due to fraud).
*   **Sps. Ignacio's Defense:**  Claimed RTC lacked jurisdiction, citing PD No. 957 and PD No. 1344, asserting exclusive HLURB jurisdiction.
*   **Risk to CGA:** Filing in the wrong venue (RTC initially) caused delay.  CGA must now pursue the case before the HLURB. The SC emphasized that, regardless of the basis for rescission (Art. 1191 or 1381 CC), the substance of CGA's claim is a *refund*, placing it squarely within HLURB's jurisdiction.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **PD No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):** Grants regulatory powers over real estate to the National Housing Authority (now HLURB).
*   **PD No. 1344:** Expands HLURB's jurisdiction to include (among other things) "[c]laims involving refund and any other claims filed by subdivision lot or condominium unit buyer against the project owner, developer..."
*   **Executive Order Nos. 648 & 90:** Transferred regulatory functions from NHA to HSRC (later HLURB).
*   **Article 1381, Civil Code:** Addresses rescissible contracts.
*   **Article 1191, Civil Code:** Addresses rescission (resolution) of reciprocal obligations. The Court notes CGA erroneously argued on this matter, but holds the error negligible.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Antipolo Realty Corp. v. NHA*, G.R. No. L-50444
    *   *Sps. Osea v. Ambrosio*, G.R. No. 162774
    *   *Roxas v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 138955
    *   *Francel Realty Corporation v. Sycip*, G.R. No. 154684
    *   *Pilar Development Corporation v. Villar*, G.R. No. 158840
    *   *Suntay v. Gocolay*, G.R. No. 144892
    *   *Fajardo Jr. v. Freedom to Build, Inc.*, G.R. No. 134692
    *   *Cadimas v. Carrion*, G.R. No. 180394

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The heart of the legal argument revolved around whether CGA's action was truly for "rescission" (outside HLURB jurisdiction per CGA's argument) or essentially a claim for "refund" (within HLURB jurisdiction). The Court emphasized that the latter characterization prevailed, regardless of the legal label attached.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   CGA should refile its complaint with the HLURB.
*   Consider potential defenses by Sps. Ignacio, including whether CGA's reliance on alleged title defects is a valid basis for rescission given the complexities of agrarian reform laws and potential arguments of waiver or estoppel.
