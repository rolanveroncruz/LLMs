Okay, here's a concise summary of the legal document provided, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) vs. Christina Sagun* (and consolidated cases), G.R. Nos. 205698, *et al.*, July 31, 2018.

**Nature:** Consolidated appeals by petition for review on *certiorari* concerning syndicated estafa charges against officers and employees of Globe Asiatique Realty Holdings Corporation (GA) and Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF). Also includes challenges to a summary judgment and injunctions.

**Background:**

*   GA and HDMF entered into Funding Commitment Agreements (FCAs) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) where GA would provide qualified buyers for HDMF loans.
*   HDMF released funds to GA based on these agreements.
*   HDMF discovered fraudulent transactions, including fictitious buyers and a "special buyers" scheme.
*   HDMF revoked GA's authority and terminated agreements.
*   Criminal charges of syndicated estafa were filed against GA officers (Delfin Lee, Dexter Lee, Christina Sagun, Cristina Salagan) and a HDMF employee (Atty. Alex Alvarez). A civil case for specific performance was also filed by GA against HDMF.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

1.  **Syndicated Estafa:** The Supreme Court (SC) ruled that while probable cause exists for *simple estafa* under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) against Delfin Lee, Dexter Lee, Christina Sagun, Cristina Salagan, and Atty. Alex Alvarez, the elements of *syndicated estafa* under P.D. No. 1689 are not fully met. The element of being a syndicate soliciting money from the public is not met as it was HDMF soliciting from the public to which these respondents defrauded.
2.  **"Special Buyers" Scheme:** the DOJ has reasonable basis to hold that Atty. Alvarez, knew, participated and consented to the illegal scheme perpetrated by respondents Delfin and Dexter Lee, Christina Sagun and Cristina Salagan. It should be underscored that Atty. Alvarez notarized crucial pieces of documents.
3.  **Information Amendment:** The SC directed the Department of Justice (DOJ) to amend the information in Criminal Case No. 18480 to charge respondents with simple estafa, not syndicated estafa.
4.  **Warrants of Arrest:** Existing warrants of arrest for syndicated estafa were deemed valid for simple estafa, pending the amendment of the information.
5.  **Makati RTC Summary Judgment:** The SC annulled the CA decision upholding the Makati RTC's summary judgment in the civil case. It ruled that the summary judgment was interlocutory because it did not determine all issues (specifically damages), and that HDMF correctly sought *certiorari* review. The case was remanded to the RTC for trial on the merits.
6.  **Injunctions:** The SC reversed the CA and lifted injunctions issued by the Pasig RTC that prevented the DOJ from conducting preliminary investigations. The SC held that such injunctions were a grave abuse of discretion. It cited the policy against enjoining criminal prosecutions and the DOJ's authority to conduct preliminary investigations. The doctrine of the law of the case applies.
7.  **Authority to Represent HDMF:** The Supreme Court emphasized that HDMF is a government-owned and -controlled corporation (GOCC) performing proprietary functions with original charter or created by special law, specifically Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1752, amending P.D. No. 1530. As a GOCC, the HDMF's legal matters are to be handled by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC)
8.  **Probable Cause:** While the DOJ had the power to determine probable cause, the injunction issued by the Pasig RTC inexcusably interfered with the DOJ's mandate

**Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 315 (Estafa) and 316 (Other Forms of Swindling).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1689:** Defines and increases penalties for syndicated estafa.
*   **Republic Act No. 9679 (Home Development Mutual Fund Law of 2009):** Governs HDMF.
*   **Hao v. People, G.R. No. 183345 (2014):**  Ruling regarding validity of arrest warrants when a lesser offense is found.
*   **Galvez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 187919, 187979, 188030, (2013):** Discusses swindling and when it applies.
*   **PHIVIDEC Industrial Authority v. Capitol Steel Corporation, G.R. No. 155692, (2003):** GOCC should be handled by Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "funds solicited from the general public" in the context of a government provident fund (HDMF).

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   Individuals can be indicted for simple estafa
*   Individuals can still be subject to preliminary investigation.
