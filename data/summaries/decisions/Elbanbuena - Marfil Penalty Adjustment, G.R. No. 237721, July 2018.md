**Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty Pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951, In Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan â€“ Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil***

**Case:** G.R. No. 237721, July 31, 2018 (En Banc)

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court decision addressing the retroactive application of Republic Act (RA) No. 10951, which amended the Revised Penal Code (RPC) by adjusting penalties based on the value of property involved in crimes like malversation. It also provides procedural guidelines for similar cases.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Retroactive Application of RA 10951:**  Following *Hernan v. Sandiganbayan*, the Court affirms that RA 10951 applies retroactively, even to final and executory judgments and ongoing sentences, if it benefits the accused.  This is an exception to the doctrine of immutability of final judgments based on equity and justice.
*   **Amended Article 217 (Malversation):**  RA 10951 amends Article 217 of the RPC, specifically altering the penalties for malversation of public funds based on the amount involved.
*   **Procedural Guidelines:** The Court establishes guidelines for filing petitions seeking (1) modification of penalties based on RA 10951 and (2) immediate release due to full service of the modified sentence. These guidelines include:
    *   **Who May File:** Public Attorney's Office, inmate, or counsel.
    *   **Where to File:** Regional Trial Court (RTC) with jurisdiction over the place of confinement.
    *   **Pleadings:** Petition and OSG comment only. Strict timelines.  Requires certified true copy of the decision, mittimus, and/or Bureau of Corrections certification.
    *   **Comment by OSG:** 10 days from notice.
    *   **Judgment:**  The court must determine (a) the imposable penalties under RA 10951, (b) the length of confinement and good conduct allowances, and (c) entitlement to immediate release. Promulgation within 10 calendar days after the comment period lapses. Immediately executory, subject to Rule 65 action for grave abuse of discretion.

**Obligations:**

*   **RTCs:** Must re-compute penalties under RA 10951 upon proper petition and determine immediate release eligibility.
*   **OSG:** Must comment on petitions within the prescribed timeframe.
*   **Petitioner:** Must provide necessary documentation and verification.

**Liabilities:**

*   None explicitly stated but failure to follow the new guidelines risks delaying the application of RA 10951. Grave abuse of discretion by the court in applying the law can lead to a special civil action under Rule 65.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  The RTC's determination of the length of confinement and eligibility for good conduct allowances could be subject to factual disputes, potentially prolonging the process.
*   **Interpretation of "Grave Abuse of Discretion":** The standard for overturning an RTC decision via Rule 65 is high. Disagreements with the RTC's interpretation of RA 10951 or its application to specific facts may not rise to the level of grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Computational Errors:** Incorrectly calculating the new sentence can have serious implications, unlawfully detaining someone or prematurely releasing a prisoner.
*  **Application of existing laws** In the course of application of RA 10951 and applying the new penalties the Courts will need to asses the applicability of Indeterminate Sentence Law and whether the existing penalties include any accessory penalties

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA No. 10951:** *Primary statute at issue, amending the RPC.*
*   **Act No. 3815 (Revised Penal Code):** Amended by RA 10951. Specifically, Article 217 concerning malversation.
*   **Hernan v. Sandiganbayan:** *Landmark case establishing the retroactive application of RA 10951 to final judgments.*
*   **Constitution, Article VIII, Section 5(5):** Supreme Court's rule-making power.
*   **Rule 65, Revised Rules of Court:** Special civil action for certiorari (grave abuse of discretion).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision does not explicitly define what constitutes "grave abuse of discretion," leaving it open to interpretation by the courts.

**For Rolando Elbanbuena:**
The case is remanded to the Regional Trial Court in Muntinlupa City for the determination of: (1) the proper penalty/penalties in accordance with RA No. 10951; and (2) whether petitioner ROLANDO ELBANBUENA y MARFIL is entitled to immediate release on account of full service of his sentences, as modified.
