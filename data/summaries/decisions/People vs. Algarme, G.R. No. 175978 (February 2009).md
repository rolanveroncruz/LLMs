## Legal Document Summary: People v. Gelle

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Samuel Algarme y Bonda and Rizaldy Gelle y Biscocho*, G.R. No. 175978, February 12, 2009 (598 Phil. 423)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for Robbery with Homicide. One of the accused, Algarme, died during the appeal, resulting in the dismissal of the case against him.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Charged appellants with Robbery with Homicide under Art. 294 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), alleging conspiracy, evident premeditation, and treachery in the stabbing death of a tricycle driver during a robbery. Specifically, the Information stated that the purpose of the killing was to steal a belt bag with cash and a wrist watch.

*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Relied on testimony of witnesses Rudy Pepito, Norman Palma, and Alicia Batarilan. Rudy identified the appellants as perpetrators. Norman placed them at the scene with the victim's property. Alicia testified regarding the stolen property.

*   **Defense Evidence:** Rizaldy Gelle presented an alibi, claiming he was elsewhere at the time of the crime.

*   **RTC Decision:** Found both appellants guilty of Robbery with Homicide, sentencing them to death. Ordered payment of damages to the victim's heirs. Modified to dismiss against deceased Algarme.

*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed the RTC decision but reduced the penalty for Rizaldy Gelle to *reclusion perpetua* due to the death of Algarme.

**Obligations:**

*   Originally, both accused were obligated to serve their sentences and pay damages. This was modified to the current single accused Rizaldy Gelle.
*   The prosecution had the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt all elements of the crime, including the "con motivo...del robo" (by reason of the robbery) intent requirement.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, both were held jointly and solidarily liable to pay the heirs of the victim for indemnity, reparation, lost earnings, moral damages, and exemplary damages. With Algarme's passing, the burden falls solely on Gelle.
*   **Current Liabilities (modified by SC):**
    *   Homicide
    *   Theft

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Misidentification:** Accused challenged the positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses; however, this challenge was ultimately rejected by the Court.
*   **Proof of Intent:** The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish that the primary intention of the accused was to commit a robbery (Art. 294, RPC). This was the critical flaw that led to the reversal of the robbery with homicide conviction.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** The SC specifically addressed this point and stated that by charging 'Robbery with Homicide' the facts alleged in the Information still contained all the relevant facts to the crimes of Homicide and Theft.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** The Court noted that the alibi was uncorroborated and inconsistent, ultimately failing.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294(1), Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Robbery with Homicide. This was the original charge, ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.
*   **Article 249, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Homicide - the penalty is *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Article 309, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Theft - the penalty is *prision correccional*.

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Teehankee, Jr.* (out-of-court identification procedure)
*   *People v. Mateo* (transfer of appeals in death penalty cases)
*   *People v. Salazar* (the intent of the actor must supply the connection between the homicide and the robbery)
*   *People v. Concepcion* (if original intent does not comprehend robbery, but robbery follows the homicide as an afterthought, they should be seen as two offenses)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Con Motivo del Robo":** Proving the intent to rob, preceding the homicide, was central to the case. The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to establish the intent to rob.
*   **Treachery and Evident Premeditation:** Although alleged in the Information, these aggravating circumstances were not proven to the satisfaction of the Court.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The SC modified the CA decision.
*   Rizaldy Gelle was found guilty of the separate crimes of Homicide and Theft.
*   Sentenced to an indeterminate penalty for each crime.
*   Ordered to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and lost earnings for the homicide, and P1,200.00 for the theft.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court overturned the CA's decision of Robbery with Homicide due to the failure to prove intent. Gelle will be sentenced separately for Homicide and Theft. He is liable for indemnity, damages, and the stolen amount. The key legal issue was the interpretation and application of "con motivo...del robo."
