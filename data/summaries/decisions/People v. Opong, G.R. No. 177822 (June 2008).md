Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Hilario Opong y Ta√±esa* (G.R. No. 177822, June 17, 2008)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Hilario Opong for two counts of simple rape, but *modified* the ruling by deleting the award of exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Facts:** Accused-appellant, Hilario Opong, was convicted for raping AAA (a minor working as a stay-in housemaid), on two separate occasions (May 2nd and May 9th, 1999), by means of force and intimidation (Art. 266 of the Revised Penal Code).
*   **Credibility of Complainant:** The Court emphasized that the credibility of the victim's testimony is paramount in rape cases. It found AAA's testimony credible, convincing, and consistent, sufficient for conviction. The court cited *People v. Andales* to emphasize that the testimony is credible, convincing and consistent with human nature, and the normal course of things, the accused may be convicted solely on the basis thereof.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The court rejected the argument that the victim's one-month delay in reporting the crime impeached her credibility, citing death threats as a valid explanation. The court cited *People v. Arsayo* in saying it is not uncommon for young rape victims to conceal for some time the assault on their virtues because of the rapist's threat on their lives
*   **Intact Hymen:** The intact hymen revealed in the medico-legal report was not considered exculpatory. The Court referenced *People v. Gabayron* to support the fact that many cases of pregnancy had been reported about women with unruptured hymens,and that there could still be a finding of rape even if, despite repeated intercourse over a period of years, the victim still retained an intact hymen without signs of injury.
*   **Consummated Rape:**  The Court affirmed that penetration, however slight, constitutes consummated rape. The act was consummated, not merely attempted, based on the victim's testimony of vaginal penetration. The court referenced *People v. Orita* in that Rape is consummated from the moment the offender has carnal knowledge of the victim.
*   **Penalties:** The sentence of *reclusion perpetua* for each count was deemed appropriate.
*   **Damages:** Civil indemnity (P50,000) and moral damages (P50,000) were awarded for each count.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** The Supreme Court reversed the award of exemplary damages. While the victim was a minor (alleged in the information), there was no allegation *and proof* of a relationship (ascendant, relative, or someone exercising moral ascendancy) between the offender and the victim as required by the law.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-B:**  Defines rape and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:**  Amended Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code
*   **Article 266-A (1)(a):** All the elements of the offense, namely, (a) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) that the same was committed by using force and intimidation.

**Potential Risks/Issues:**

*   **Victim's Credibility as Sole Evidence:** Relying heavily on the victim's testimony, even if credible, always carries some inherent risk.
*   **No Corroborating Physical Evidence:** The lack of physical injury (intact hymen) could be challenged.
*   **Incorrect application of exemplary damages**
*   **Standard legal defenses:** Inconsistencies in testimony, alternate theories of the case, etc.
