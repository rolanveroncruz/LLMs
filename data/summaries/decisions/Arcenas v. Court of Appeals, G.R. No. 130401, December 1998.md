## Legal Document Summary: *Arcenas v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 130401, December 4, 1998*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing a petition for annulment of judgment from the Regional Trial Court (RTC). The RTC judgment was a revival of a prior judgment in Civil Case No. 35349.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Judgment (Civil Case No. 35349):** Dismissed plaintiff Espino's complaint, ordered Espino to return a barge to Dela Riva, pay unrealized profit, and jointly sentenced both Espino and Arcenas to pay moral and exemplary damages, plus attorney's fees, to Dela Riva and Sy.
*   **Revival of Judgment:** Dela Riva filed a complaint to revive the judgment, seeking issuance of a writ of execution against Arcenas. The RTC granted the revival, ordering Arcenas to pay P171,022.00 (surety bond), P10,000.00 (moral/exemplary damages), and 15% attorney's fees.
*   **Service of Summons:** Substituted service was attempted on Arcenas through his mother after an initial attempt at his alleged residence failed. Arcenas was declared in default after failing to answer.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   Original Judgment: Arcenas jointly liable for moral and exemplary damages, plus attorney's fees.
*   Revived Judgment (RTC): Arcenas liable for surety bond amount, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. Significantly increases the liability imposed on Arcenas in the original decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The primary issue is whether the RTC validly acquired jurisdiction over Arcenas. Arcenas alleges improper service of summons as he was residing in the United States at the time of attempted service. This hinges on the validity of substituted service given Arcenas' alleged non-resident status. *Panteleon vs. Asuncion* establishes that personal service is required for actions *in personam* where the defendant doesn't voluntarily submit to the court's authority.
*   **Modification of Judgment:** The revived judgment substantially increased Arcenas's liability beyond the original judgment, ordering payment of the surety bond amount, which was not part of the original ruling against him. This violates the principle of immutability of final judgments. *Manning International Corporation vs. NLRC* states a final judgment cannot be altered or modified.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Arcenas argues his right to due process was violated due to improper service and the substantial alteration of the judgment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Sections 6, 7, 15, & 16 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs personal service, substituted service, and service on non-residents.
*   **Rule 131, Section 3(m) of the Rules of Evidence:** Discusses the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties (re: sheriff's return).
*   ***Panteleon vs. Asuncion* (105 Phil. 765):**  Mandates personal service in actions *in personam* to acquire jurisdiction over the defendant.
*   ***Manning International Corporation vs. NLRC* (195 SCRA 155):**  Reinforces the immutability of final judgments.
*   ***Francisco vs. Bautista* (192 SCRA 388):** Any substantial amendment or alteration to a final judgment is null and void for lack of jurisdiction.
*   ***Compan√±ia General de Tabacos vs. Maritnez* (29 Phil. 515):** Purpose of revival is to extend enforcement, not modify.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the petition, reversing the CA decision. The RTC's revived judgment was invalidated due to lack of jurisdiction over Arcenas and the substantial modification of the original judgment.

**For Lawyer's Consideration:**

*   The success of the petition hinges on the Court's determination regarding Arcenas's residency at the time of service. Evidence of Arcenas's residency in the U.S. is crucial.
*   The ruling clearly establishes that a revival of judgment cannot be used to increase or alter the liabilities imposed in the original judgment.
*   This case provides a strong precedent against attempts to circumvent the rules on service of summons and the principle of finality of judgments.
