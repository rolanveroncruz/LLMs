## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ramos*, G.R. No. 172470 (2008)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Sammy Ramos for four counts of rape under Article 335(1) of the Revised Penal Code (prior to amendment by RA 7659), relating to incidents occurring between January 18, 1992, and March 28, 1992. The accused was acquitted of 46 other similar charges.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 335(1) RPC (prior to RA 7659):** Defines and penalizes rape. Relevant because the crime occurred before RA 7659 restored the death penalty for qualified rape. The applicable penalty is *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The Informations (Criminal Cases No. 1770, 1771, 1772, 1831) detail the specific dates of the four counts of rape where the Appellant "through force and intimidation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with his own 12-year old daughter, AAA against her will and without her consent, to her damage and prejudice."

**Facts:**

*   The victim (AAA), the 13-year-old daughter of the appellant, testified to multiple instances of rape committed by her father while living together.
*   The prosecution presented medical evidence (Dr. Gorospe's testimony) showing old lacerations and abrasions consistent with repeated sexual assault.
*   The defense offered a denial and alleged that the victim ran away with money.
*   Both the RTC and CA found the victim's testimony credible.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant:** Convicted of four counts of rape and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* for each count.  He is obligated to pay the victim civil indemnity (₱50,000 per count) and moral damages (₱50,000 per count, increased from the RTC's award).
*   **State:** Bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defense Arguments Rebutted:** The Court specifically addresses and rejects the defense arguments that the victim had her clothes on and did not react "outraged." The Court recognizes that the victim's actions are understandable for a child in her situation. The Court also mentions the victim's initial delay in reporting is not an indication of fabrication because of the power her father held over her at the time and fear of the threats that he made.
*   **Victim Credibility:** Key issue in rape cases. The court emphasizes the credibility of the victim's testimony.
*   **Delay in Reporting:** The court acknowledges the initial delay in reporting the abuse but applies the established precedent that this delay doesn't necessarily indicate fabrication, particularly in cases involving children and family members.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335, Revised Penal Code (prior to RA 7659):** Defines and penalizes simple rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 7659 (Death Penalty Law):** Relevant because it potentially alters the penalty but is not applicable retroactively to these crimes.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262 (“Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004”):** Allows the use of initials to protect the victim's privacy.
*   Numerous cited cases regarding the evaluation of testimony in rape cases, especially those involving child victims. The Court cited case law in explaining that reactions to harrowing incidents may not be uniform and not to expect uniform reactions from rape victims. *People v. Orquina, 439 Phil. 359, 365-366 (2002).*
*   **Regarding assessment of Damages:** *People v. Calongui, G.R. No. 170566, 3 March 2006, 484 SCRA 76, 88*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   None explicitly apparent. The Court addresses potential areas of contention raised by the defense (e.g., victim's behavior, attire) but resolves them based on the evidence and legal precedent.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, upholding the conviction and penalty. The court emphasized the credibility of the victim's testimony, the weight of the medical evidence, and the lack of credibility in the appellant's defense. The penalty of reclusion perpetua for each count was deemed appropriate under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as it existed before amendment. There are no apparent grounds for further appeal.
