## Summary of *Charles B. Baylon vs. Atty. Jose A. Almo* (A.C. No. 6962)

**Legal Issue:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Jose A. Almo for notarizing a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) with a forged signature.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Forged SPA:** Complainant alleges SPA authorizing his wife to mortgage his property contained a forged signature.
*   **Notarization:** Atty. Almo admitted notarizing the SPA.
*   **Reliance on Identification:** Atty. Almo claimed reliance on a Community Tax Certificate presented by an impostor representing himself as the complainant.

**Findings and Obligations:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the IBP's finding of negligence on the part of Atty. Almo in failing to properly ascertain the identity of the person signing the SPA.
*   The Court emphasized the importance of diligence in notarization, citing *Santiago v. Rafanan, A.C. No. 6252, October 5, 2004, 440 SCRA 91*.
*   Reliance on a Community Tax Certificate was deemed insufficient, particularly given its unreliability as a form of identification as emphasized in Dela Cruz v. Zabala, A.C. No. 6294, November 17, 2004, 442 SCRA 407, 411.
*   Atty. Almo's prior familiarity with the complainant (having previously notarized documents for him) heightened his duty to verify the signature.

**Liabilities and Risks:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Revocation of notarial commission, disqualification from reappointment as Notary Public for two years, and suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary risk stemmed from Atty. Almo's failure to comply with the standard of care expected of notaries public, as defined in the *2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Sec. 12*, specifically regarding *competent evidence of identity*.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Santiago v. Rafanan, A.C. No. 6252, October 5, 2004, 440 SCRA 91* – Emphasizes the importance of notarization.
*   *Dela Cruz v. Zabala, A.C. No. 6294, November 17, 2004, 442 SCRA 407, 411* - established unreliability of community tax certificates for proving identity
*   *2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, Rule II, Sec. 12* – Defines "competent evidence of identity."
*   *Vda. de Bernardo v. Restauro, Adm. Case No. 3849, June 25, 2003, 404 SCRA 599, 604.* - Establishes exercising utmost diligence in ascertaining the true identity of the person who represented himself and was represented to be the complainant.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Almo faced disciplinary action due to negligence in notarizing an SPA with a forged signature. He failed to adequately verify the identity of the individual presenting himself as the complainant, relying solely on a Community Tax Certificate. This constitutes a violation of the required standard of care for notaries public, leading to penalties.
