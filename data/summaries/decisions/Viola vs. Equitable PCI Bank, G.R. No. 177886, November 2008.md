## Legal Document Summary - *Spouses Viola v. Equitable PCI Bank, Inc.*

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 177886, November 27, 2008

**Subject:** Annulment of Foreclosure Sale, Accounting, and Damages

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Spouses Leopoldo S. Viola and Mercedita Viola
*   **Respondent:** Equitable PCI Bank, Inc.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Credit Line Agreement:** Granted Leo-Mers Commercial, Inc. (owned by Petitioners) a P4,700,000 credit line. Stipulated "prevailing PCIBank lending rate" and a "penalty fee of three percent (3%) per month on the outstanding amount."
*   **Real Estate Mortgage:** Secured the credit line over two parcels of land. Covered the principal amount (P4,700,000), "interest and bank charges accruing thereon," costs of collection, etc.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Obligated to repay the principal loan, interest, and any applicable penalty fees. Defaulted on payments after November 24, 2000.
*   **Respondent:** Obligated to provide a clear accounting of payments and the outstanding debt.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners obtained a credit line secured by a real estate mortgage.
*   Petitioners made partial payments, but Respondent claimed a significant outstanding balance due to unpaid interest and penalty fees.
*   Respondent extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage.
*   Petitioners sued to annul the foreclosure, arguing overpayment, improper accounting, and the inclusion of exorbitant and unconscionable interest and penalties not secured by the mortgage.

**Court Rulings:**

*   **Trial Court:** Ruled that the mortgage secured the interest but reduced the interest rate from 15% to 12% per annum and the penalty fee from 3% to 1.5% per month. Nullified the foreclosure, allowing a re-foreclosure based on the re-computed amount.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the trial court, holding that "bank charges" in the mortgage included penalty charges from the credit line agreement.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed *with modification*. Held that the mortgage *did not* secure the 3% monthly penalty fee because the penalty fee was not explicitly mentioned in the mortgage agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court excluded the "penalty fee" per month of the outstanding obligation in the computation of the amount secured by the Real Estate Mortgage executed by petitioners in respondent's favor

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity Between Contracts:** The core issue is the ambiguity created by the separate Credit Line Agreement and Real Estate Mortgage, specifically concerning the penalty fees. The mortgage's lack of explicit mention of the 3% monthly penalty, found only in the credit agreement, is the crucial point. This is critical for compliance with **Section 1371 of the Civil Code**, interpretation against party causing ambiguity.
*   **"Bank Charges" Interpretation:** The Court of Appeals' interpretation of "bank charges" to include penalty fees is rejected by the Supreme Court. This interpretation is important because the bank has to be very careful of its wording when drafting a contract.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The Supreme Court notes the mortgage contract was one of adhesion and must be construed strictly against the bank.
*   **Usury/Unconscionable Interest:** The trial court considered the interest and penalties "excessive and exorbitant," leading to equitable reduction. While the Supreme Court's ruling hinges on the *security* of the penalties, the underlying issue of excessive charges could resurface if the respondent attempts to pursue a deficiency claim outside of the mortgage.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals, 323 Phil. 297 (1996):** Cited extensively for the principle that a mortgage must sufficiently describe the debt secured and ambiguity is construed against the drafter.
*   **Ejusdem Generis:** Used by the court to interpret the term "other obligations" within the context of specific enumerated obligations. The penalty is not similar in nature.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Mortgages must clearly and specifically define the debt they secure. Broad phrases like "bank charges" may not suffice to include penalties stipulated in separate loan agreements.
*   Ambiguity in contracts, especially those of adhesion, is construed against the drafter.
*   While a mortgage may be an accessory contract, its terms cannot be implied or inferred; they must be expressly stated.
*   Penalties should be specifically stated.
