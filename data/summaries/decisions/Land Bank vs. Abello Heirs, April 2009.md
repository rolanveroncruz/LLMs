**Case Summary: Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Carolina B. Vda. De Abello, G.R. No. 168631, April 7, 2009**

**Subject:** Determination of just compensation for land expropriated under PD 27, in light of subsequent enactment of RA 6657 (CARL).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **PD 27 & EO 228:**  LBP argues that the land was taken upon the effectivity of PD 27 (Oct 21, 1972), and just compensation should be based on land value as of that date, using the formula under PD 27 & EO 228.
*   **RA 6657 (CARL):**  Respondents argue that just compensation should be determined under RA 6657, considering the agrarian reform process was incomplete when RA 6657 was enacted. RA 6657 considers current land value, actual use, income, and tax declarations (Sec. 17).
*   **Section 75, RA 6657:** Specifies that PD 27 and EO 228 have suppletory effect to RA 6657.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **LBP's Obligation:** To pay just compensation to landowners for expropriated land.
*   **Just Compensation:** Dispute centers on whether just compensation should be computed based on PD 27/EO 228 (lower valuation) or RA 6657 (higher valuation).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation Date:** The primary dispute lies in the valuation date. LBP argues for the date of PD 27's effectivity (1972), while the court ultimately uses the date closer to the final determination of just compensation.
*   **Applicability of PD 27 vs. RA 6657:** This is the crux of the appeal. LBP asserts the primacy of PD 27/EO 228, while the court applies RA 6657 directly. The court interprets Section 75 of RA 6657 to mean that PD 27 only has suppletory effect.
*   **Prolonged Delay in Determination of Just Compensation:** Court cites the DAR's failure to determine just compensation in a timely manner as a reason to apply RA 6657.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Association of Small Landowners in the Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform, G.R. No. 78742, July 14, 1989:** Title to expropriated property passes upon *full payment* of just compensation.
*   **Office of the President, Malaca√±ang, Manila v. Court of Appeals, 413 Phil. 711 (2001):** Seizure of landholding does not take place on the date of effectivity of PD 27 but on payment of just compensation.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad, G.R. No. 127198, May 16, 2005:**  Determination of just compensation should be in accordance with RA 6657, especially when there has been significant delay.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo, G.R. No. 168553, February 4, 2008:** Consistent with Natividad, RA 6657 applies when agrarian reform process is incomplete.

**Statutory References:**

*   **PD 27:**  Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants.
*   **EO 228:**  Valuation of Rice and Corn Lands Covered by P.D. No. 27
*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law - CARL):** Sets out guidelines for land reform and just compensation.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denied* LBP's petition, affirming the CA's decision which upheld the SAC's determination of just compensation at P200,000 per hectare based on the factors enumerated in Section 17 of RA 6657. The Court ruled that RA 6657 is applicable, with PD 27 and EO 228 having only suppletory effect. The Court emphasized that just compensation should be the full and fair equivalent of the property, determined in accordance with current values and relevant factors, rather than the outdated values from 1972.

**Legal Analysis:**

The SC firmly established that the date of "taking" for agrarian reform purposes is not the date of PD 27's effectivity but rather the date just compensation is fully paid. Due to the substantial delay in determining just compensation, using the values prescribed under PD 27/EO 228 would be inequitable and would deprive the landowners of the fair market value of their land. The application of RA 6657 is crucial to ensure that landowners receive just compensation that reflects the current value of their property, in line with constitutional principles. The decision highlights the importance of timely determination and payment of just compensation in agrarian reform cases.
