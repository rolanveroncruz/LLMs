*   Atty. Padiernos admitted notarizing the documents but denied knowledge of the forgeries.

*   Revocation of his notarial commission.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The case highlights the risk associated with failing to adhere strictly to notarial requirements, specifically identity verification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Atty. Padiernos' defense relied on a misinterpretation (or miscitation) of precedent, arguing that personal knowledge of the signatory is unnecessary if the signature occurs in the notary's presence.  This argument was rejected by the Court.

**Legal Precision:**

The core issue revolves around the standard of care expected of a notary public in verifying the identity of individuals executing documents.  The case clearly establishes that a failure to demand proof of identity, especially in transactions involving significant property rights, constitutes negligence and a violation of professional responsibility.
