## Legal Document Summary: A. Francisco Realty vs. Javillonar (G.R. No. 125055)

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari concerning a loan agreement between A. Francisco Realty (Petitioner/Mortgagee) and the Javillonar spouses (Respondents/Mortgagors), secured by a real estate mortgage and an undated deed of sale. The RTC ruled in favor of the Petitioner, but the CA reversed it, citing lack of jurisdiction and the presence of *pactum commissorium*. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's finding of *pactum commissorium* but reversed its ruling on jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Agreements:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** P7.5 Million loan, secured by a real estate mortgage and undated deed of sale of the mortgaged property. Additional P2.5 Million loan extended later.
*   **Interest:** 4% per month interest on both loans.
*   **Promissory Notes:** Included stipulations that upon failure to pay interest, full possession and ownership would automatically transfer to the Petitioner, and the deed of sale would be registered.
*   **Deed of Mortgage:** Provided for the mortgaged property as security for the loan.
*   **Deed of Sale (Undated):** Executed as additional security. The key point of contention is the condition that it would be registered upon default, effectively transferring ownership to the Petitioner.
*   **Possession Clause:** A clause in the second promissory note stipulates that in case the mortgagor fails to pay the debt then, the Mortgagor promises to allow the Mortagee to appropriate and occupy for their exclusive use the real property.

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents (Mortgagors):** Obligated to repay the principal loans and interest.
*   **Petitioner (Mortgagee):** Implied obligation to act in good faith and follow legal foreclosure procedures in case of default.

**Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Petitioner (Mortgagee):**
    *   **Pactum Commissorium:** Risk of voiding the transfer of ownership due to the *pactum commissorium* doctrine (Art. 2088, Civil Code). The stipulations allowing automatic appropriation of the property upon default are illegal.
    *   **Failure to Foreclose Properly:** By registering the deed of sale instead of initiating foreclosure, Petitioner violated established legal procedures.
*   **Respondents (Mortgagors):**
    *   **Default:** Risk of losing the property if the loans remain unpaid, but *only* through proper foreclosure proceedings initiated by the Petitioner.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2088, Civil Code:** Prohibits *pactum commissorium*. This is the central legal basis for the court's decision.
*   **Uy Tong v. Court of Appeals, 161 SCRA 383 (1988):** Defines the elements of *pactum commissorium*.
*   **Nakpil v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 225 SCRA 456 (1993):** Applied *pactum commissorium* even in the absence of an express mortgage deed.
*   **Reyes v. Sierra, 93 SCRA 472 (1979):** Registering mortgaged property in the mortgagee's name upon default constitutes *pactum commissorium*.
*   **De Leon v. Court of Appeals, 245 SCRA 166 (1995):** Distinguishes between unlawful detainer and other possessory actions.
*   **B.P. Blg. 129, Section 33:** Delineates the jurisdiction of Municipal Trial Courts over forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The clause in the promissory notes allowing automatic transfer of ownership upon default is the most contentious and ultimately deemed void. It is at the core of the *pactum commissorium* violation.
*   The understanding of the parties that the defendants shall pay a monthly rental of P400,000.00 a month until they vacate the premises is a contentious point because the plaintiff's claim to own the property has been declared void, therefore the claim for rentals is rendered moot.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The Petitioner risks losing ownership of the property and may be exposed to claims for damages if they fail to follow the proper legal procedures for foreclosure.
*   The Respondents risk losing the property if the debt isn't paid, and if a legitimate foreclosure procedure is properly followed.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of *pactum commissorium*. The decision highlights the strict prohibition against agreements that allow creditors to automatically appropriate collateral upon default, bypassing the required foreclosure process.
