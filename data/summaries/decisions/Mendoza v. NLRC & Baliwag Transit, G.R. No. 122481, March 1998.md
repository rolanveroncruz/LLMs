**Legal Document Summary: *Ernesto L. Mendoza v. National Labor Relations Commission and Baliwag Transit Inc.* (G.R. No. 122481, March 05, 1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari seeking to annul NLRC resolution dismissing an illegal dismissal complaint based on prescription and laches.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment:** Petitioner was a bus driver compensated on a commission basis.
*   **Incident:** Petitioner's bus was involved in a major accident in 1983.
*   **Termination:**  After being "grounded," Petitioner was eventually told to find another job in December 1986 due to the accident.
*   **Complaint:** Petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal in 1990.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** The NLRC affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision, which dismissed the complaint due to prescription (4-year period under Art. 1146 of the Civil Code applicable to actions based on injury to rights) and laches.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Baliwag Transit, Inc.):** To comply with due process requirements (notice and hearing) before dismissing an employee.
*   **Employee (Mendoza):** To file a complaint for illegal dismissal within the prescriptive period.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employer (Baliwag Transit, Inc.):** Held liable for illegal dismissal due to failure to provide notice and hearing. Ordered to pay backwages (limited to 3 years due to dismissal predating RA 6715), separation pay, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Prescription/Laches:** The central legal issue. The court disagreed with the NLRC's computation of the prescriptive period, holding that the cause of action accrued in 1986 when the employee was formally dismissed, not in 1983 (date of accident).
*   **Abandonment:**  The employer's defense of abandonment was rejected due to lack of evidence demonstrating the employee's intent to abandon his job, coupled with his filing of the illegal dismissal case.
*   **Retroactive Application of RA 6715:** The Court correctly applies the law in effect at the time of dismissal, limiting backwages to 3 years, per *Sealand Service, Inc. vs NLRC, 190 SCRA 347 [1990]; Lantion vs. NLRC, 181 SCRA 513 [1990]*, as the dismissal occurred before the effectivity of RA 6715.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Baliwag Transit, Inc. vs. Ople and Hughes, 171 SCRA 250 [1989]:** Cited as precedent for determining when the cause of action for illegal dismissal accrues (i.e., when reinstatement is formally denied, not simply when a triggering event occurs).
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Provides for reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees.
*   **Imperial Victory Shipping Agency vs. NLRC, 200 SCRA 178 [1991] & Chavez vs. Bonto-Perez, 242 SCRA 81 [1995]:**  Emphasize that laches cannot defeat a cause of action filed within the statutory prescriptive period. Equity follows the law.
*   **RA 6715 (Herrera Law):** Relevant because the dismissal predated its effectivity, thus limiting backwages calculation. Cites *Sealand Service, Inc. vs NLRC, 190 SCRA 347 [1990]; Lantion vs. NLRC, 181 SCRA 513 [1990]; Berllandares, Jr. vs. NLRC, 245 SCRA 217 [1995]; Maranaw Hotels and Resort Corp. vs Court of Appeals, 215 SCRA 501 [1992]; Asiaworld Publishing House, Inc. vs. Ople, 152 SCRA 219 [1987] *
*   **Due Process:** *Labuhadon vs. NLRC, 251 SCRA 130 [1995].; Kingsize Manufacturing Corp. vs. NLRC, 238 SCRA 349 [1994] Phil. Savings Bank vs. NLRC, 261 SCRA 409 [1996]; Samillano vs. NLRC, 265 SCRA 788 [1996])*

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the NLRC's decision, ruling that the illegal dismissal complaint was filed within the prescriptive period. Baliwag Transit was found liable for illegal dismissal due to a lack of due process. The decision reinforces the importance of following proper procedures for employee termination and adhering to statutory periods for filing labor complaints. This case also illustrates the non-retroactivity of laws that would substantially alter vested rights.
