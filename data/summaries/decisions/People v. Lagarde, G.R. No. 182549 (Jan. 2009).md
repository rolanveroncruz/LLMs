## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Lagarde (G.R. No. 182549)

**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Sergio Lagarde

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (Second Division)

**Citation:** 596 Phil. 883 (G.R. No. 182549, January 20, 2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment of conviction for rape.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Accused-appellant Sergio Lagarde was charged with rape of a minor (11 years old) under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code. The information stated the crime occurred on December 27, 2001, in San Miguel, Leyte, and involved force and intimidation.
*   **Prosecution's Evidence:** The prosecution presented testimony from the victim (AAA), and medical examiners. AAA testified that Lagarde, a neighbor, assaulted her in a copra dryer. Medical examination revealed a healed incomplete laceration of the hymen.
*   **Defense's Evidence:** Lagarde denied the charges and presented an alibi, claiming he was at a death anniversary celebration and never left the premises. A witness, Lolita, corroborated part of his story.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC found Lagarde guilty of rape, citing the victim's credible testimony and the medical findings. The RTC imposed the death penalty, citing aggravating circumstances: minority of the victim, use of a bladed weapon, force, and the uninhabited place.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA affirmed the conviction but modified the penalty to *Reclusion Perpetua* because the alleged aggravating circumstances were not specifically cited in the information. The CA also reduced the civil indemnity awarded to the victim.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant: Serve *Reclusion Perpetua* and pay civil indemnity (Php 50,000) and moral damages (Php 50,000) to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Accused-appellant: Criminal liability for rape.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The CA correctly identified that the death penalty was imposed in error by the trial court.  The elements to elevate the penalty beyond Reclusion Perpetua were not sufficiently proven and pleaded.
*   **Defense Witness:** Lolita's credibility was questioned due to her relationship with the accused-appellant, and the fact that she was drinking upstairs, while the assault took place downstairs.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A and 266-B of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines the crime of rape and penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. (RA) 8353 (The Anti-Rape Law of 1997):** Amended provisions of the Revised Penal Code regarding rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Abolished the death penalty.
*   **Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Requires that the information states the designation of the offense and specifies its qualifying and aggravating circumstances.
*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 7, 2004, 433 SCRA 640):** Transferred the case to the Court of Appeals for review because of the penalty of death imposed by the trial court.
*   **Case law re: Credibility of victim testimony**

**Ambiguities & Further Considerations:**

*   The lack of specific details in the information regarding the aggravating circumstances prevented the imposition of the death penalty. This highlights the importance of precise pleading in criminal cases.
*   The CA's emphasis on the abolition of the death penalty reinforces the legal precedent against capital punishment in the Philippines.
