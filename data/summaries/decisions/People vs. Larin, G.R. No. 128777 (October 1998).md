## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Larin* (G.R. No. 128777)

**Subject:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 7610, Section 5(b):** Penalizes the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse.
*   **RA 7610, Section 3(a):** Defines "child" as a person below eighteen (18) years of age.
*   **RA 7610, Section 31(e):** Mandates the maximum penalty when the offender is a public officer.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 7610, Section 32, Article XIII** defines what constitutes as lascivious conduct.

**Facts:**

*   Accused Ernesto Larin, a lifeguard or swimming instructor at UPLB, was convicted of committing acts of lasciviousness against a 14-year-old female student (AAA) in a shower room. The acts included shaving her pubic hair, performing cunnilingus, licking her breasts, forcing her to hold his penis, and forcibly kissing her.
*   The prosecution argued that Larin took advantage of his authority, influence, and moral ascendancy over AAA.
*   The defense denied the charges, arguing the acts were consensual and challenging the credibility of the victim's testimony.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Larin:** Convicted of violating Section 5(b) of RA 7610 and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. Also ordered to pay P50,000 in moral damages.
*   **State:** Has the obligation to provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse, as stated in RA 7610.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Defense Argument Regarding "Coercion or Influence":** The defense argued that there was no proof that the complainant was coerced or influenced by the accused to engage in the acts. The Court finds the prosecution sufficiently established moral and psychological coercion based on the victim's testimony and the psychologist's assessment.
*   **Definition of "Lascivious Conduct":** The acts performed by the accused are clearly defined as lascivious under Section 32, Article XIII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 7610.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7610:** Central statute in the case.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 336:** Referenced by the defense but ultimately not applicable due to RA 7610's specific provisions for child sexual abuse.
*   **University of the Philippines v. Regino, 221 SCRA 598, 602, May 3, 1993** establishes that employment at UPLB makes Larin part of the civil service.
*   **Article 203, Revised Penal Code** defines "public officer."
*   **Established jurisprudence:** The court cites numerous cases to support the credibility of victim testimony and the trial court's assessment of facts (e.g., *People v. Atuel, 261 SCRA 339, 349, September 3, 1996*).
*   **Prevailing jurisprudence** reduces the original P100,000 moral damages awarded by the trial court to P50,000.

**Contentious Clauses/Arguments:**

*   **Definition of Public Officer:** Larin's status as a public officer triggered the maximum penalty under Section 31(e) of RA 7610. While he argued he was just a lifeguard, the Court considered him a public officer.
*   **Credibility of the Victim:** The defense heavily attacked the credibility of AAA, arguing her reactions were unnatural. The Court consistently upheld the trial court's finding that AAA's testimony was credible and that her submissiveness did not negate the crime.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Ernesto Larin for violating Section 5(b) of RA 7610, but reduced the amount of moral damages. The Court emphasized the State's policy to protect children from sexual abuse, highlighting the importance of moral ascendancy and coercion in establishing the crime. Larin, as a public officer, was rightly sentenced to the maximum penalty of *reclusion perpetua* due to the grave abuse of his position of trust.
