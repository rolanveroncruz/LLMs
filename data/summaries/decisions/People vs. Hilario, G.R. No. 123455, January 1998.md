## Legal Document Summary: People v. Hilario, G.R. No. 123455 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction for murder (Art. 248, RPC).

**Key Issue:** Whether the accused-appellant, Arnold Hilario, was guilty of murder either as a principal or as a conspirator in the death of Juan Placer.

**Court Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions, acquitting accused-appellant Arnold Hilario.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Information:** Hilario was charged with murder, alleging conspiracy with three other individuals, for the mauling and stabbing death of the victim.
*   **Witness Testimony:** The prosecution's key witnesses provided conflicting accounts of Hilario's direct participation, specifically regarding kicking and hitting the victim with a steel chair.
*   **Medical Evidence (Autopsy Report):** Crucially, the autopsy report, including testimony from Dr. Maximo Reyes, found *no* contusions, abrasions, lacerations, or hematomas on the victim. The sole cause of death was stab wounds.
*   **Conspiracy:** The court found no proof of a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. While Hilario was present at the crime scene, mere presence is insufficient to establish conspiracy. The Court reasoned that because victim suffered no injury besides the stab wounds, there was no evidence Hilario contributed to the crime, even in the absence of his co-conspirators. The court cited *People v. Cedon, 233 SCRA , 187 [1994]* holding that mere presence of an accused at the scene of the crime does not imply conspiracy.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The Court deemed prosecution witnesses' testimonies suspect due to inconsistencies and contradictions. Shermie Maglalang's initial statement differed from her court testimony regarding who stabbed the victim. *Also, the court found that Aclaw's credibility was questionable.* The lack of corroboration from PO3 Gamboa of the dying declaration further undermined its weight.
*   **Dying Declaration:** While a witness testified the victim identified Hilario as an assailant, the court found that several tests to determine validity had not been met.
*   **Non-Flight:** The fact that Hilario did not flee the scene, unlike his co-accused, was considered indicative of innocence. The Court noted that it is hornbook knowledge that flight from the locus criminis is a strong indication of a guilty mind; therefore, the opposite is true.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The Court emphasized the constitutional right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Statutory References:**

*   Art. 248, Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Rule 124, Sec. 13(2), Rules of Court (Certification of case to Supreme Court)

**Case Law:**

*   *People v. Cedon, 233 SCRA , 187 [1994].* (Mere presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient for conspiracy)
*   *People v. Silvestre, 244 SCRA 481 [1995]* (Conspiracy can be inferred from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated)
*   *People v. Dulatre, 248 SCRA 109 [1995]* (Each co-conspirator must participate, even by a single overt act, in the perpetration of the crime)
*   *People v. Abellanosa, 264 SCRA 747 [1996]* (Accused is entitled to an acquittal unless his guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The initial charge relied heavily on conspiracy. Failure to definitively establish Hilario's role in the stabbing rendered his conviction unsustainable.
*   Prosecution evidence conflicted with medical evidence, creating reasonable doubt.

**Overall:** The SC emphasized the importance of corroborating evidence, particularly medical evidence, and highlighted the high burden of proof required in criminal cases. It also demonstrates the strict scrutiny applied to claims of conspiracy and the circumstances surrounding dying declarations.
