**Case:** *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Myrna Alvarez (CA Personnel Concerned)*, A.M. No. CA-98-8-P, March 11, 1998

**Nature:** Disciplinary Action against a Court of Appeals Employee.

**Facts:**

*   A case (Civil Case No. 88-1558) was appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) but dismissed for failure to pay docket fees.
*   Appellants filed a Motion for Reconsideration and attempted to pay docket fees.
*   CA Utility Worker, Myrna Alvarez, allegedly gave misleading instructions regarding payment of docket fees, leading to delayed filing.
*   The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed by the appellants assailing the denial of the motion to admit payment of docket fee in CA.
*   The SC ordered an investigation by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) into Alvarez's conduct.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Improper Advice:** Alvarez, a utility worker, improperly advised a messenger on how to pay docket fees, despite not being a "frontliner" or having legal background.
*   **OCA Investigation:** Found no bad faith or malice on Alvarez's part, but criticized the practice of allowing non-legal personnel to give legal advice.
*   **Supervisory Liability:** Buenaventura Miguel, Acting Chief, Judicial Records Division, was found remiss in his duty to supervise subordinates and prevent improper practices.
*   **Duty of Counsel:** The court emphasized counsel's responsibility to ensure staff are properly trained in filing procedures.
*   **Cited Case Law:** *Villamor vs. Vera Cruz, Jr.* (227 SCRA 239) and *Juntilla vs. Calleja* (262 SCRA 291) for the conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility. *Cui vs. Madayag* (245 SCRA 1) was also cited as reference to the Code of Judicial Conduct. *Young vs. Office of the Ombudsman* (228 SCRA 718) was also cited for the proper observance of indisputable technicalities designed to ensure its proper dispensation of justice.
*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.09 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** It requires head of department to be meticulous and zealous in organizing and supervising the work of his subordinates.

**Sanctions/Order:**

*   Myrna Alvarez: Reprimanded and warned against meddling in matters outside her assigned duties.
*   Buenaventura Miguel: Admonished for allowing unqualified personnel to give legal advice, and directed to correct the practice.
*   Clerk of Court and Assistant Clerk of Court: Directed to remind Chiefs of Offices/Divisions and their personnel, specially those offices with direct dealings with the public to be more prudent in the discharge of their duties and responsibilities.
*   Atty. Semproniano S. Ochoco: Advised to ensure staff are knowledgeable in filing procedures.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for Alvarez due to improper advice and acting outside her scope of duties.
*   Supervisory liability for Miguel due to failure to properly supervise staff and allowing improper practices.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Misleading":** The finding of "misleading" instructions relies heavily on the messenger's testimony and interpretation. It's unclear if the instructions were inherently wrong or merely poorly communicated.
*   **Impact of "No Bad Faith":** While acknowledging no bad faith, the court still imposed sanctions. This raises the question of whether the sanction is disproportionate to the offense, especially for Alvarez.
*   **Vagueness of Corrective Action:** The directive to Miguel to "correct the practice" lacks specific guidance. Implementation depends on his interpretation and may lead to inconsistent application.
