## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Balubal* (G.R. No. 234033)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Amado Balubal for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically illegal sale of 0.07 grams of *shabu*. The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* Balubal due to a failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, primarily stemming from breaches in the chain of custody.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).
*   **Chain of Custody:**  The core issue is whether the prosecution adequately established an unbroken chain of custody for the seized *shabu*, as required by Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 and its implementing rules (prior to the 2014 amendment by R.A. 10640).  Specifically:
    *   **Missing Witnesses:** The inventory and photography of the seized items lacked *both* a media representative *and* a DOJ representative, with a court interpreter acting as a substitute witness, which the SC explicitly deemed insufficient and not in compliance with Section 21.
    *   **Justifiable Grounds and Preservation of Integrity:** Prosecution failed to offer justifiable grounds for not complying with Section 21 and failed to sufficiently establish the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item.
    *   **Fourth Link Deficiency:**  A critical gap in the chain of custody existed *after* laboratory analysis.  The prosecution failed to present testimony or evidence detailing the handling and custody of the *shabu* from the forensic chemist to its presentation in court. The "Chain of Custody Form" was also incomplete, as well as testimonial evidence regarding the proper evidence custodian.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including establishing an unbroken chain of custody for seized drugs. *Mallillin v. People* (576 Phil. 576 (2008)) and *People v. Kamad* (624 Phil. 289 (2010)) are cited regarding the necessary links in the chain.
*   **Law Enforcement Obligations:** Apprehending officers have specific obligations under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 to properly document and secure seized drugs, including conducting inventory and photography in the presence of required witnesses.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Section 21 IRR "Saving Clause":** The SC acknowledges the "saving clause" in the IRR of R.A. 9165, which allows for non-compliance with certain requirements under justifiable grounds, provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved. However, in this case, the prosecution failed to establish justifiable grounds for their non-compliance and was unable to sufficiently establish the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item.
*   **Doctrine of Presumption of Regularity:** The RTC and CA relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties. The SC ruled that the failure to comply with Section 21 requirements negated this presumption, shifting the burden to the prosecution to prove the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Miniscule Amount of Drugs:** The SC emphasized the heightened scrutiny required in cases involving small quantities of drugs due to the increased risk of planting and tampering, citing *People v. Casacop* (755 Phil. 265, 283 (2015)).

**Conclusion:**

The *Balubal* case highlights the crucial importance of strict compliance with the chain of custody requirements in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to secure required witnesses during the inventory and photography, along with the subsequent gap in custodial documentation after laboratory analysis, created reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the evidence, leading to the accused's acquittal. The SC emphasizes that procedural rules under R.A. 9165 are substantive law, not mere technicalities, and failure to comply can have severe consequences for the prosecution. Further, the SC clearly stated a minimum standard for DOJ representation: someone from the National Prosecution Service of the DOJ is required to witness the inventory and photography of the seized shabu and sign the corresponding inventory report.
