**Legal Document Summary: *Republic of the Philippines vs. Sandiganbayan, et al.*, G.R. No. 119292 (1998)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Certiorari challenging Sandiganbayan Resolutions regarding the validity and lifting of sequestration orders issued by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG).

**Key Issue:** Whether the Sandiganbayan erred in declaring the sequestration orders against Prime Holdings, Inc. (PHI) and its shares in Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corporation (PTIC) "automatically lifted" due to:

1.  Invalidity of the sequestration orders because they were signed by only one PCGG Commissioner, allegedly violating Section 3 of the PCGG Rules and Regulations.
2.  Failure of the PCGG to file the proper judicial action or implead PHI within the period prescribed by Section 26, Article XVIII of the 1987 Constitution.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition for certiorari and *affirmed* the Sandiganbayan Resolutions, effectively upholding the lifting of the sequestration orders.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **PCGG Rules, Section 3:** Requires sequestration orders to be authorized by at least two PCGG Commissioners. This case held that the two signatures must be present on the order itself as proof of authorization.  *Republic vs. Dio Island Resort* was cited, and the Supreme court reiterated that non-commissioners cannot issue valid sequestration orders. *Republic vs. Provident International Resources Corp*., where a similar issue was resolved due to the sequestration order being issued *before* the rule, was distinguished.
*   **1987 Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 26:** Mandates that judicial actions or proceedings related to sequestration orders issued before ratification must be filed within six months of ratification (February 2, 1987).  The constitutional provision is very clear regarding the automatic lifting of freeze orders where there is no corresponding judicial action or proceeding instituted.
*   **Executive Order No. 2 (EO 2):** The PCGG argued that this order acted as a *general freeze* and *sequestration* and could not be lifted; this argument was rejected. The Court distinguished EO 2 as a general policy statement and EO 1 as delegating specific power to PCGG.
*   **Due Process:** Critical throughout, especially regarding the failure to implead PHI in the original complaint and the timing of the amended complaint to include them.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PCGG Rules and Regulations, Section 3:** (Validity of Order)
*   **1987 Constitution, Article XVIII, Section 26:** (Time limits)
*   **Executive Order No. 1 & 2:** (Creation of PCGG and freezing of ill-gotten wealth).
*   ***Republic vs. Sandiganbayan, Romualdez and Dio Island Resort*** (258 SCRA 685, July 12, 1996): Invalidity of sequestration order signed by a non-Commissioner.
*   ***Republic vs. Sandiganbayan (Third Division), Provident International Resources Corp., and Phil. Casino Operators Corp.*** (269 SCRA 316, March 7, 1997): Upholding the validity of a writ signed by only one commissioner because it predated the PCGG Rules and Regulations.
*   ***Republic vs. Sandiganbayan (First Division)***, related to the necessity of impleading corporations.
*   **Bataan Shipyard & Engineering Co., Inc. (BASECO) vs. PCGG**, defining the scope and limits of sequestration.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Sequestration Orders:**  The core issue revolved around whether the sequestration orders lacking two commissioner signatures were valid from the outset. The court said no.
*   **Timeliness of Action:** The PCGG's failure to implead PHI within the constitutional deadline doomed its action against that entity.  Amending the complaint *after* the deadline did not cure the defect.  *Florenz D. Regalado, Remedial Law Compendium* was referenced regarding pleading amendments.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** The argument that listing PTIC in the original complaint sufficed to implicate PHI (a separate corporate entity) was rejected on due process grounds.
*   **Campos' Testimony:** Campos' testimony was considered immaterial to the primary issues.

**Ambiguous Clauses/Points of Contention:**

*   Interpretation of Section 3 of the PCGG Rules and Regulations, particularly whether authority of at least two commissioners needs to be explicitly evidenced by the signatures in the Order of Sequestration. This was resolved that the requirement for two signatures is paramount to avoid spurious/ fictitious sequestration orders.

**Conclusion:**

The PCGG's failure to adhere to its own rules regarding the signing of sequestration orders, coupled with its delay in bringing the proper parties into the judicial action, resulted in the lifting of the sequestration orders. This case underscores the importance of strict compliance with procedural rules and constitutional deadlines, even in cases involving alleged ill-gotten wealth. The Court emphasized that while the *lifting* of the sequestration orders does not preclude the government from proving the assets are, in fact, ill-gotten in the main case, the PCGG had forfeited its custodial power over these assets due to its procedural missteps.
