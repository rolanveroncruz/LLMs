Okay, here's a legally precise summary of the document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Spouses Jose Manuel and Maria Esperanza Ridruejo Stilianopoulos v. The Register of Deeds for Legazpi City and The National Treasurer*, G.R. No. 224678, July 3, 2018 (835 Phil. 351)

**Core Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) correctly ruled that the Stilianopoulos' claim against the Assurance Fund was barred by prescription under Section 102 of P.D. No. 1529.

**Background:**

*   The Stilianopoulos spouses owned Lot No. 1320 covered by TCT No. 13450.
*   Jose Fernando Anduiza fraudulently cancelled TCT No. 13450 and obtained TCT No. 42486 in his name on October 9, 1995.  It is noted that the issuance of TCT No. 42486 was not entered in the Primary Entry Book.
*   Anduiza mortgaged the land to Rowena Hua-Amurao, who foreclosed and obtained TCT No. 52392 on July 19, 2001.
*   Amurao sold to the Co Group, who obtained TCT No. 59654.
*   Stilianopoulos discovered the fraud on January 28, 2008. They first filed a complaint dismissed for failure to allege the assessed value, and then filed the current action on March 18, 2009, against the RD, National Treasurer, Anduiza, Amurao, and the Co Group, seeking annulment of titles, recovery of possession, damages and payment of monetary claims from the Assurance Fund.

**RTC Ruling:**

*   Dismissed claims against Amurao and the Co Group as *bona fide* purchasers for value (BFPVs).  (This ruling became final as to those parties).
*   Found Anduiza liable for fraud and ordered him to pay damages.
*   Held the National Treasurer, as custodian of the Assurance Fund, *subsidiarily* liable if Anduiza couldn't pay.  The RTC reasoned that the 10-year prescription period for the reconveyance action based on implied trust (due to fraud) ran from the discovery of the fraud in 2008, and the 6-year period for the claim against the Assurance Fund hadn’t expired either.

**CA Ruling:**

*   Reversed the RTC's ruling on the Assurance Fund's subsidiary liability.  The CA held that the six-year prescriptive period under Section 102 of P.D. 1529 ran from October 9, 1995 (issuance of Anduiza’s title), thus the claim was time-barred. The CA relied on the *obiter dictum* in *Guaranteed Homes, Inc. v. Heirs of Valdez*, 597 Phil. 437 (2009).

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Granted** the petition, reversed the CA, and reinstated the RTC ruling *in toto*, directing the RTC to conduct execution proceedings.
*The six-year prescriptive period under Section 102 of P.D. 1529 should be counted from January 28, 2008, or the date when petitioners discovered the anomalous transactions over their property, which included the registration of Rowena's title over the same. Thus, when they filed their complaint on March 18, 2009, petitioners' claim against the Assurance Fund has not yet prescribed. Accordingly, the CA erred in ruling otherwise.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Section 95, PD 1529:**  Outlines conditions for compensation from the Assurance Fund (loss/damage without negligence through fraud or error; barred from recovering the land).
*   **Section 96, PD 1529:** Specifies against whom the action is filed (Register of Deeds, National Treasurer, and others responsible for the fraud).
*   **Section 97, PD 1529:** Addresses judgment satisfaction, requiring execution first against other defendants before seeking payment from the Assurance Fund.  Notably, prior declaration of insolvency or inability to recover from the usurper is *not* required before filing an action against the Assurance Fund.
*   **Section 101, PD 1529:**  Excludes liability of the Assurance Fund for breach of trust, resurvey or subdivision errors. Constructive trust arising from fraud is explicitly excluded.
*   **Section 102, PD 1529:** Establishes the six-year prescriptive period "from the time the right to bring such action first occurred."
*   **Ratio Decidendi:**
    *An action against the Assurance Fund on the ground of "fraudulent registration under the Torrens system after the land's original registration" may be brought only after the claimant's property is registered in the name of an innocent purchaser for value. This is because it is only after the registration of the innocent purchaser for value's title (and not the usurper's title which constitutes a breach of trust) can it be said that the claimant effectively "sustains loss or damage, or is deprived of land or any estate or interest therein in consequence of the bringing of the land under the operation of the Torrens system."

    *The constructive notice rule on registration should not be made to apply to title holders who have been unjustly deprived of their land without their negligence.

*   The *obiter dictum* pronouncement in the case of Guaranteed Homes, Inc. v. Heirs of Valdez that prescription starts running upon the fraudulent registration of the title in favor of the usurper is non-binding.
*Jurisprudence:
    *Escobar v. Luna: A spring cannot rise higher than its source.

*   The general rule is that "a right of action accrues only from the moment the right to commence the action comes into existence, and prescription begins to run from that time x x x."[66] However, in cases involving fraud, the common acceptation is that the period of prescription runs from the discovery of the fraud.
*   The rationale for the rule on innocent purchasers for value "is the public's interest in sustaining 'the indefeasibility of a certificate of title, as evidence of the lawful ownership of the land or of any encumbrance' on it."[49] Notably, the term "innocent purchaser for value" may also refer to an innocent mortgagee who had no knowledge of any defects in the title of the mortgagor of the property, such as in this case.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Application of "Good Faith":**  While the Co Group's status as BFPVs was a settled matter due to the finality of the RTC decision, the application of the "due diligence" standard in determining good faith can be subjective and fact-dependent. Future cases could hinge on the precise actions a buyer must take to be considered a BFPV and thus trigger the Assurance Fund claim.

**Notes for the Attorney:**

*   The Supreme Court clarified the prescription period for Assurance Fund claims in cases of fraudulent title transfers.
*   The ruling emphasizes the importance of actual knowledge of the fraud in starting the prescriptive period.
*   The strict interpretation against applying the "constructive notice" doctrine is beneficial for clients who were unaware of fraudulent activities affecting their land titles.
*   Prior jurisprudence (Tenio-Obsequio) implying that a prior declaration of insolvency or inability to recover from the usurper is *not* required before filing an action against the Assurance Fund.

This summary provides a framework for understanding the key legal arguments and potential implications of this case.
