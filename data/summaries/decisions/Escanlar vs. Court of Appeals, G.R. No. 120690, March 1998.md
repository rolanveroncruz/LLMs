**Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Pedro Escanlar vs. Court of Appeals***

**Case:** G.R. No. 119777 & G.R. No. 120690, March 26, 1998 (351 Phil. 384)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motions for Reconsideration of a prior Supreme Court decision regarding a double sale of land.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Heirs of Pedro Escanlar, Francisco Holgado, Spouses Edwin and Elisa Jayme.
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, Generosa Martinez, Cari-an heirs (Carmen, Rodolfo, Nelly Chua Cari-an et al.), Spouses Paquito and Ney Sarrosa-Chua, Register of Deeds of Negros Occidental.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Subject Matter:** Dispute over ownership of Lot Nos. 1616 and 1617, originally part of the conjugal estate of Guillermo Nombre and Victoriana Cari-an.

2.  **Prior Transactions:**

    *   **First Sale (Cari-ans to Escanlar/Holgado):** The Cari-an heirs, successors of Victoriana Cari-an, sold their hereditary shares (1/2 interest in the lots representing Victoriana's share of the conjugal property) to Escanlar and Holgado. The Supreme Court affirmed the validity of this sale of *pro indiviso* shares.
    *   **Second Sale (Cari-ans to Chuas):**  The Cari-an heirs subsequently sold the same lots to the Chuas. This sale was deemed invalid to the extent of the prior sale to Escanlar/Holgado.
    *   **Sales by Nombre Heirs to Escanlar/Jaymes:** Heirs of Guillermo Nombre (descendants of his siblings), sold undivided interests in Guillermo Nombre's half of the lots to Escanlar, who then conveyed these interests to the Jaymes. This is a critical point as it impacts the eventual ownership proportions.

3.  **Supreme Court's Original Decision:** The Court initially remanded the case to the RTC to determine the specific portions of Lots 1616 and 1617 to be owned by each party (Escanlar/Holgado heirs vs. Cari-an heirs). The Court also initially awarded the remaining half of the land to the Chuas and held the Jaymes liable for rent.

4.  **Motions for Reconsideration:** Petitioners argued that the original decision erroneously awarded the *entire* remaining one-half to the Chuas, as the Nombre heirs sold portions of that share to Escanlar (later to Jaymes).

5.  **Revised Ruling:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the Motions for Reconsideration. The Court acknowledged that the Nombre heirs sold portions of their share to Escanlar (Jaymes), increasing the Jaymes' ownership stake *beyond* the Cari-an inheritance. The court directed the RTC to recalculate ownership interests.

6.  **Remand to RTC:** The case is remanded to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) to:

    *   Determine *exactly* the portions of Lots 1616 and 1617 owned by each party (Heirs of Escanlar/Holgado, Jaymes, Cari-an heirs, and Chuas) based on all sales. The initial decision directed the RTC to issue corresponding certificates of title based on the determined ownership.
    *   Determine the rental payments owed by the Chuas to the Jaymes for any portions of the lots the Chuas possessed that properly belong to the Jaymes, since they cannot hold the Jaymes liable for rentals.

**Obligations:**

*   **RTC Negros Occidental:** Must determine the specific ownership portions and order issuance of titles accordingly, and determine rental payments (Chuas to Jaymes) in accordance with the Supreme Court's resolution.
*   **Chuas:** Potentially obligated to pay rental payments to the Jaymes for possession of land portions owned by the Jaymes.
*   **Jaymes:** Must participate in RTC proceedings to establish their ownership percentage.
*   **Heirs of Escanlar and Holgado:** Must participate in RTC proceedings to establish their ownership percentage.
*   **Cari-an Heirs:** Must participate in RTC proceedings to establish their ownership percentage.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Chuas:** Potential liability for rental payments to the Jaymes.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Sales:**  The burden of proof lies on the Jaymes to demonstrate the validity and extent of the sales from the Nombre heirs to Escanlar. The parties' actual ownership percentage and the portions corresponding to each of them may depend on the sales made by the heirs of the Nombre family.
*   **Valuation of Rentals:**  Determining reasonable rental rates for the portions of land owed to the Jaymes might be contentious.
*   **RTC Interpretation:** How the RTC interprets and applies the Supreme Court's directives could lead to further appeals.
*   **Unclear Land Division:** Potential future disputes regarding the physical division of the lots.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutes:**

*   **Sale of Hereditary Rights:**  The Supreme Court recognizes the validity of selling hereditary rights/shares in an estate before partition (pro indiviso ownership).
*   **Double Sale (Art. 1544, Civil Code):** The principle of prior tempore, potior jure applies, but is complicated by the *pro indiviso* nature of the sales and the subsequent sales of shares by the Nombre heirs.  This article governs the preference given to the first buyer in good faith of real property in cases of double sales.
*   **Rules of Evidence:** The RTC will need to assess the admissibility and probative value of the deeds of sale and other documents presented to prove ownership percentages.

**Recommendations:**

*   Conduct thorough due diligence on all deeds of sale to confirm validity.
*   Engage a surveyor to accurately determine the boundaries and extent of the land in dispute.
*   Prepare a strong legal argument supported by documentary evidence to establish the Jaymesâ€™ ownership percentage and claim for rental payments.
*   Be prepared for potential appeals after the RTC decision.
