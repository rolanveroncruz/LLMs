**Key Issue:** Validity of a tax sale of petitioners' property by the City of Makati to Laverne Realty and Development Corporation (Laverne) due to alleged procedural irregularities under the Local Government Code (LGC) concerning notice of delinquency, levy, and sale.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Noemi S. Cruz and Heirs of Hermenegildo T. Cruz (original property owners).
*   **Respondents:** City of Makati, City Treasurer of Makati, Register of Deeds of Makati, Laverne Realty and Development Corporation (purchaser at tax sale).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **LGC Sections 254, 258, 260:** These sections outline the mandatory procedures for tax delinquency sales, including:
    *   Posting of notice of delinquency at the main hall and barangay.
    *   Publication of notice of delinquency in a newspaper of general circulation.
    *   Service of warrant of levy on the delinquent owner or occupant.
    *   Posting and publication of the notice of sale.
*   **Obligation of City of Makati:** Strict adherence to the LGC's procedural requirements for tax delinquency sales.
*   **Petitioners' Obligation (Originally):** Comply with court orders to inform the trial court of developments in a related consolidation motion.

**Alleged Liabilities & Violations:**

*   **City of Makati's Liability:** Alleged failure to comply with LGC Sections 254, 258, and 260 by:
    *   Sending billing statements to the wrong address (Unit 1407 instead of 407).
    *   Failing to properly notify petitioners of the warrant of levy.
    *   Failing to properly post notices of delinquency sale.
    *   Failing to remit excess sale proceeds to petitioners.
*   **Laverne's Liability:** Participation in an irregular tax sale.
*   **Potential Violation of Due Process:** Petitioners allege deprivation of property without due process due to the city's procedural failures.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC)/RA 7160:** The core statutory framework governing real property tax delinquency sales. Sections 254, 258, and 260 are central.
*   **Genato Investments, Inc. v. Barrientos, 739 Phil. 642 (2014):** Similar case involving Laverne and a tax sale, highlighting the importance of due process and strict adherence to statutory requirements.
*   **Corporate Strategies Development Corporation v. Agojo, 747 Phil. 607 (2014):** Reinforces the mandatory nature of LGC requirements for tax sales.
*   **Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals, 501 Phil. 101 (2005):** Underscores that there is no presumption of the regularity of any administrative action which results in depriving a taxpayer of his property through a tax sale.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 17, Section 3:** Dismissal of case due to fault of plaintiff.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 13, Sections 6 and 13:** Proof of service of motions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Section 19:** Proof of service by publication.

**Ambiguous & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Service of Warrant of Levy:** Disputed whether the warrant of levy was properly served on the petitioners.
*   **Compliance with Notice Requirements:** Factual dispute regarding whether the city properly posted and published notices of tax delinquency and sale.
*   **Consolidation:** Validity of dismissing the annulment case due to the failure to inform of the development of a consolidation motion.
*   **Default:** Validity of the RTC's denial of the motion to declare respondent Laverne in default.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Invalid Tax Sale:** The tax sale could be declared void, requiring the City of Makati to refund Laverne's purchase price and restore ownership to the petitioners.
*   **Damages:** Petitioners could potentially recover damages from the City of Makati for wrongful deprivation of property if the sale is annulled.
*   **Collusion:** The Supreme Court raises the possibility of collusion between the buyer and the public officials.

**Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, REVERSED the Court of Appeals' decision and the trial court's orders dismissing the complaint for annulment of sale, except for the denial of default.
*   It reasoned that the procedural faults of the petitioners were overridden by the possible illegality of the tax sale and that there was no consolidation to inform about because LRC Case No. M-5237 was dismissed.
*   The Supreme Court held the importance of protecting property owners from irregularities in tax sales.
