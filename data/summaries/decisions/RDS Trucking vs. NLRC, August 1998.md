## Legal Document Summary: *RDS Trucking v. NLRC and Aldus*, G.R. No. 123941, August 27, 1998

**Nature:** Petition assailing the NLRC decision affirming illegal dismissal of employee Charlie A. Aldus.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal. RDS Trucking failed to prove just cause under Art. 282 of the Labor Code. Alleged grounds (serious misconduct, willful disobedience, gross negligence) were unsubstantiated. The company failed to provide due process (opportunity to be heard).
*   **Grounds for Dismissal:** The employer alleged that the employee was dismissed for past infractions amounting to gross misconduct, specifically: unauthorized trip without a helper resulting in an accident, exceeding cargo limits, and causing damage to vehicles. The SC found that these allegations were not sufficiently proven.
*   **Due Process:** The SC found a complete absence of due process in the dismissal, describing it as a "fire-the-employee-let-him-explain-later" policy.
*   **Lack of Formal Hearing:** The SC rejected the petitioner's argument that the Labor Arbiter committed grave abuse of discretion by not conducting a formal hearing or asking clarificatory questions. Citing *Republic Planters Bank v. Agana, Sr., G. R. No. 51765, 3 March 1997, 269 SCRA 1*, the SC emphasized that propounding questions is discretionary for the Labor Arbiter under Sec. 4, Rule V of the NLRC Rules of Procedure.
*   **Malicious Mischief Criminal Case:**  The SC considered the subsequent criminal case for malicious mischief filed against Aldus. However, his acquittal (though found liable for simple imprudence) did not validate the illegal dismissal.  Simple negligence is not a ground for dismissal; per Article 282(b), it must be "gross and habitual." Citing *Caraan v. NLRC, G.R. No. 106454, 21 October 1993, 227 SCRA 337 and National Sugar Refineries Corporation v. NLRC, G.R. No. 122277, 24 February 1998*.
*   **Remedy:** Reinstatement was deemed undesirable due to strained relations. Instead, RDS Trucking was ordered to pay separation pay (one month's pay per year of service) and back wages from the date of termination (November 20, 1993) to the date of the SC decision, without deduction, citing *Equitable Banking Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, 273 SCRA 352.*

**Obligations:**

*   RDS Trucking: Payment of separation pay and back wages.

**Liabilities:**

*   RDS Trucking: Liable for illegally dismissing Charlie Aldus.

**Potential Risks:**

*   This case reinforces the employer's burden to prove just cause and provide due process in termination cases.
*   The employer's failure to substantiate the allegations, coupled with the lack of a hearing or formal investigation, highlights the risk of a finding of illegal dismissal.
*   This case demonstrates that evidence from other legal proceedings, such as a conviction of malicious mischief, may not be sufficient to validate a prior illegal dismissal.
