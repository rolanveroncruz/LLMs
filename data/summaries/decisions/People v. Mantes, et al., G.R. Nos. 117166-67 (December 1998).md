## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mantes, et al. (G.R. Nos. 117166-67, Dec. 3, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Domingo Francisco of Parricide and Randy Mantes, Jerome Garcia, and Jovy Velasco of Murder.

**Key Provisions & Judgement:** The Supreme Court **REVERSED** the lower court's decision and **ACQUITTED** all accused based on reasonable doubt.

**Core Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Admissibility of Confessions:** The primary issue revolves around the admissibility of alleged oral confessions made by the accused during custodial investigation.
    *   **Violation of Art. III, ยง12 of the Constitution:** The Court held that the alleged confessions violated the accused's constitutional rights against self-incrimination and the right to counsel during custodial investigation. *Miranda Rights* equivalent not adhered to. *People v. Deniega, 251 SCRA 626, 637 (1995)* highlights requirements for admissible confessions (voluntary, competent counsel, express, written). *People v. Cabintoy, 247 SCRA 442 (1995)* is cited to show verbal admission is inadmissible under same provision.
    *   **Uncounselled Interrogation:** The police officers admitted that the accused were interrogated without counsel, and the alleged confessions were not reduced to writing. This renders them inadmissible.
*   **Proof of Corpus Delicti:** The Court found the prosecution's evidence regarding the identity of the victim's body to be hearsay, violating **Rule 130, Sec. 36**. Witness testimonies identifying the burnt cadaver were based on hearsay. *People v. Damasco, 212 SCRA 547 (1992)* shows such testimonies have no probative value.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court determined that the prosecution failed to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt (Art. III, ยง14, par.(2)).
*   **Motive & Alleged Admission:** The Court deemed Domingo Francisco's alleged admission to Maria Vda. de Tawat as vague and insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Motive alone is insufficient for conviction (*People v. Mariano Marcos, 70 Phil. 468, 478 (1940); People v. Pisalvo, 108 SCRA 211, 226 (1981); People v. Macatangay, 107 Phil. 188, 194 (1960)*).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance of the trial court on uncounselled oral confessions is a major procedural flaw.
*   The ambiguity surrounding the identification of the body due to it being "burnt beyond recognition" presents a significant challenge to establishing corpus delicti. The lack of direct testimony from those who identified the body introduces a critical hearsay issue.
*   The Court deemed the witness testimony unsubstantiated as neighbor were not even related to the family, which casts grave doubts on the veracity of the prosecution's claim.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   The state had the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which it failed to do.
*   Law enforcement has a clear obligation to adhere to constitutional rights during custodial investigations.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Art. III, ยง12 of the Philippine Constitution:** Right against self-incrimination and right to counsel.
*   **Art. III, ยง14, par.(2) of the Philippine Constitution:** Presumption of innocence.
*   **Rule 130, Sec. 36:** Hearsay rule.
