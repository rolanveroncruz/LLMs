**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of the accused-appellant, Restituto Valenzuela, on two counts of rape.

**Case Law:**
*   People v. Cabalquinto, G.R. No. 167693 - Withholding victim's real name
*   People v. Pancho, G.R. Nos. 136592-93 - Statutory rape; lack of hymenal rupture not preclusive

*   People v. Negosa, G.R. No. 142856-57 - Allegations of qualifying circumstances
*   People v. Miclat, Jr., G.R. No. 137024 - Allegations of qualifying circumstances

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 335 (pre-RA 8353):** Definition and penalties for rape, with emphasis on statutory rape (victim under 12).
*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 266 (as amended by RA 8353):** Definition and penalties for rape, including qualifying circumstances (not applicable retroactively).
*   **Republic Act No. 7659:**  Amendment to the Revised Penal Code imposing the death penalty on heinous crimes.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997):**  Amended Article 335, making it Article 266 (not applicable retroactively to the 1994 charge).
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibition of the death penalty in the Philippines.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 8880 (1994 Rape):** Appellant was charged and convicted of statutory rape under Article 335 of the RPC due to the victim being under 12 years old. Force is immaterial in statutory rape cases. The court emphasized the credibility of the victim's testimony and the unlikelihood of a child fabricating such a charge against her father.
*   **Criminal Case No. 8881 (1997 Rape):** The court acquitted the appellant, finding the prosecution's evidence insufficient to prove the rape beyond a reasonable doubt. The victim's testimony lacked specific details.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 8880:** Guilty of statutory rape. Sentence: *Reclusion perpetua* (death penalty commuted due to RA 9346).
*   **Monetary Liabilities (Criminal Case No. 8880):**
    *   Civil Indemnity: P50,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.00

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Incorrect Application of Law by Lower Courts:** The RTC initially applied Article 266 (as amended by RA 8353) retroactively, which was incorrect. While the CA rectified the penalty in light of RA 9346, it failed to correctly base the sentence on the circumstance that the victim was under 12 years of age at the time of the rape.
*   **Relationship as Qualifying Circumstance:**  The Information failed to allege the common-law relationship between the appellant and the victim's mother, which prevented its consideration as a qualifying circumstance for imposing the death penalty.  This highlights the importance of proper pleading in criminal Informations.

**Ambiguities:**
*   Lack of specific details in the victim's testimony regarding the 1997 alleged rape, leading to acquittal.

**Summary of Holdings:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction in Criminal Case No. 8880 for statutory rape, finding the victim's testimony credible. The Court reduced the sentence to *reclusion perpetua*, not based on R.A. No. 9346, but by interpreting Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code based on the circumstance that the victim was below 12 years of age at the time of the rape.  It also imposed civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. The Court acquitted the appellant in Criminal Case No. 8881 due to the lack of specific evidence.
