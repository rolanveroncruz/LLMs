## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mejares

**Case:** G.R. No. 225735, January 10, 2018 (823 Phil. 459)

**Subject:** Qualified Theft conviction appeal

**Holding:** Affirmed conviction for Qualified Theft but *modified* penalty due to Republic Act No. 10951. Accused ordered released on time served.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Information:** Mejares, a domestic servant, charged with qualified theft (Art. 310, RPC) for stealing cash and jewelry amounting to P1,556,308 from her employer, Jacqueline Gavino.
*   **Prosecution Evidence:** Relied on testimonies of household helper (Torres), complainant (Gavino), driver (Baluyot), security guard (Garcia), and investigating officer (Hipolito). Theory centered on a "dugo-dugo" gang scam ruse orchestrated by Mejares to gain access to valuables.
*   **Defense:** Mejares claimed to be a victim of the "dugo-dugo" gang, acting under instructions from someone impersonating her employer and/or her secretary, negating *animus lucrandi*.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of qualified theft of articles worth P1,056,308.00. Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC Decision in toto.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:**
    *   Affirmed conviction for Qualified Theft, finding grave abuse of confidence given Mejares' position as a domestic helper. Rationale aligns with *Corpuz v. People* (734 Phil. 353).
    *   Modified penalty based on R.A. 10951, adjusting property value thresholds.
    *   *Critically*, the Court found insufficient evidence to establish the value of the stolen items, citing *People v. Paraiso* (377 Phil. 445), *People v. Marcos* (368 Phil. 143), and *Francisco v. People* (478 Phil. 167), particularly concerning valuation of jewelry and foreign currency without supporting documentation.
    *   Applied minimum penalty under Art. 309(6), RPC (as amended by R.A. 10951, sec. 81) â€“ *arresto mayor*.
    *   Elevated penalty by two degrees per Art. 310 (Qualified Theft) to *prision correccional* in its medium and maximum periods.
    *   Applied Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL), resulting in a minimum sentence of 4 months and 1 day of *arresto mayor* to a maximum of 3 years, 6 months, and 21 days of *prision correccional*.
    *   Ordered immediate release as Mejares had already served more than the modified sentence.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused originally had the obligation to serve *reclusion perpetua*. This was later revoked.
*   Originally, accused was also obligated to pay reparations but this was reversed due to lack of factual and legal basis.
*   State's obligation to provide due process and assess penalties fairly in light of prevailing laws and circumstances (especially economic factors as per Justice Abad's dissent in *Corpuz v. People*).

**Liabilities:**

*   While the criminal liability for qualified theft was upheld, the penalty and corresponding obligation to pay civil indemnity were drastically reduced.
*   Employer suffered loss of property but was unable to recoup losses through legal means, due to failure to present sufficient evidence on the value of the stolen items.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation of Stolen Goods:**  The Supreme Court highlights the significant risk of improperly valuing stolen items without proper documentary evidence (receipts, expert appraisal, exchange rates). This creates uncertainty and potential for unjust penalties. Reliance on complainant testimony alone is insufficient.
*   **Retroactive Application of R.A. 10951:** While beneficial in this case, retroactive application of R.A. 10951 could create administrative burdens and necessitate re-evaluation of existing sentences.
*   **"Dugo-Dugo" Defense:**  The case illustrates the potential for using the "dugo-dugo" scam as a defense. The focus on *animus lucrandi* and the credibility of witness testimonies become paramount in such cases.
