**Legal Document Summary: *Hipos, Sr. v. Bay, G.R. Nos. 174813-15, March 17, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for Mandamus under Rule 65 to compel a trial judge to dismiss criminal cases (rape and acts of lasciviousness) after the City Prosecutor filed a Motion to Withdraw Informations due to a finding of no probable cause upon reinvestigation.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Prosecutorial Discretion:** The City Prosecutor, after reinvestigation, reversed a prior resolution and found no probable cause, leading to the Motion to Withdraw Informations.
*   **Judicial Discretion:** The trial court (Judge Bay) denied the Motion to Withdraw Informations, leading to the Petition for Mandamus.
*   **Mandamus Inapplicability:** The Supreme Court held that mandamus is not the proper remedy to compel a judge to exercise discretion in a specific way (dismissing the cases). Mandamus can only compel a judge to *act* on a motion, not to decide it in a particular manner.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Trial Court's Obligation:** The trial court has a duty to independently assess a Motion to Withdraw Informations based on lack of probable cause, even if supported by a prosecutor's resolution. (Cites *Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*). The judge cannot simply rubber-stamp the prosecutor's decision. However, *Crespo v. Mogul* doctrine reiterated, vesting jurisdiction and discretion with the trial court once the information is filed.
*   **Prosecutor's Role:** The Prosecutor retains discretion and control of the prosecution, but the court is not bound by the Prosecutor's opinion. (Cites *People v. Montesa, Jr.*).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Clerical Error:** The dispositive portion of the trial court's order contained a possible clerical error ("finding *no* probable cause"), contradicted by the body of the order which affirmed the existence of probable cause. The Supreme Court held that the body of the decision prevails over the fallo in this instance due to the clear intent shown in the reasoning.
*   **Misrepresentation by Counsel:** Attorney Procopio S. Beltran, Jr., counsel for Petitioners, was cited for potentially misleading the Court by misquoting a Supreme Court ruling (*Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*) by implying that the excerpt from the case states that denial of a Motion to Withdraw Informations is void when there is no grave abuse of discretion by prosecutors. Beltran was ordered to "show cause" why he shouldn't be disciplined.
*   **Independent Assessment Requirement:** The trial court's denial of the motion could have been subject to certiorari if the denial wasn't the product of independent assessment of the issues presented in the motion. However, the Supreme Court found the requirement satisfied.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court (Mandamus)**
*   **Crespo v. Mogul, G.R. No. L-53373, 30 June 1987, 151 SCRA 462**

*   **Republic Act No. 9262**
*   **Rule 10.02 of the Code of Professional Responsibility**

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court dismissed the Petition for Mandamus. The case was remanded to the RTC for resumption of proceedings. The Supreme Court also agreed with the trial court's finding of probable cause after reviewing the records.

**Risk Analysis:**
Petitioners were unsuccessful in challenging the trial court's discretion. A key risk was the attempt to compel the trial court using mandamus, an inappropriate remedy, and the potentially unethical conduct of counsel in misrepresenting case law.
