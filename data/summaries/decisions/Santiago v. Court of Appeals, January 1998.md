**Legal Document Summary: *Santiago v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 121908 (1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision dismissing a petition challenging RTC orders in a property partition case (Civil Case No. 462-M-94, Malolos, Bulacan). The partition case stemmed from the probate proceedings of Juan G. Santiago's holographic will (SP No. Q-93-15854, Quezon City).

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Ester Santiago, et al. (Heirs claiming through Juan G. Santiago's brother, Jose)
*   **Respondents:** Court of Appeals, RTC Judge Camilo O. Montesa, Jr., and Aurea G. Santiago (Surviving spouse and administratrix of Juan G. Santiago's estate)

**Key Provisions & Timeline:**

1.  **Probate:** Juan G. Santiago's holographic will admitted to probate in QC (Sept 13, 1993). Aurea G. Santiago appointed administratrix.
2.  **Partition Suit:** Aurea, as administratrix, sued Petitioners in Bulacan for quieting of title and partition (May 17, 1994).  Based on her right stemming from the probate proceeding of her husbands will.
3.  **Motion to Dismiss (MTD):** Petitioners filed MTD arguing Juan G. Santiago waived his share in the property to his brother Jose (predecessor of petitioners).
4.  **Initial Dismissal:** RTC initially granted the MTD (Aug 2, 1994).
5.  **Reconsideration Granted:** RTC reversed itself and denied the MTD (Sept 20, 1994).
6.  **Answer Filed:** Petitioners filed Answer with Counterclaim.
7.  **Motion to Suspend/Defer:** Petitioners sought to suspend the partition proceedings pending a motion to set aside the probate order in QC (Jan 19, 1995).
8.  **Motion Denied:** RTC denied the Motion to Suspend (Feb 10, 1995).
9.  **Certiorari to CA:** Petitioners filed certiorari with the CA (May 3, 1995), challenging the denial of the MTD and the Motion to Suspend.
10. **CA Decision:** CA dismissed the certiorari petition due to laches regarding the MTD denial and mootness due to the denial by the Probate Court of the challenge to Juan G. Santiago's will.
11. **Supreme Court Petition** Petitioners file a motion to the Supreme Court.

**Key Issues and Holdings:**

*   **Laches:** The CA correctly held that the Petitioners were guilty of laches.
*   **Mootness:**  The CA was correct to deem the issue of suspending the RTC case moot due to the denial of the motion to set aside the order admitting the holographic will.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Estoppel:** Petitioners are estopped from questioning the denial of the MTD because they filed an Answer and participated in subsequent proceedings. *Zamboanga City Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. Buat,* (G.R. No.100514, March 29, l995, 243 SCRA 47). This case essentially prohibits a party from raising a jurisdiction issue *after* the party has submitted themselves and lost in the case on the merits.
*   **Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** The denial of the motion to set aside the probate order, coupled with the SC's denial of the related certiorari petition (G.R. No. 122718), strengthens the position of Aurea and the validity of the probate proceedings.
*   **Frivolous Litigation:** Pursuing further challenges could be construed as vexatious and subject the Petitioners to sanctions.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:**  Governs certiorari proceedings and the "reasonable time" requirement for filing.
*   *De la Paz vs. Panis, 245 SCRA 242; Freeman, Inc. vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, 233 SCRA 735; Carimol vs. NLRC, 225 SCRA 582.*  Establishes that a "reasonable period" for filing a petition is 3 months
*   *Zamboanga City Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. Buat, G.R. No.100514, March 29, l995, 243 SCRA 47.* Establishes that a party cannot raise the issue of jurisdiction once the party has submitted themselves to it and lost.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The document mentions a "waiver" by Juan G. Santiago. The nature, validity, and evidentiary support for this waiver are not fully detailed in the provided decision but it seems that it was presented as a defense to the partition case.
*   Petitioners' arguments lacked substance due to ambiguous allegations, and were "not directed to the validity of the decision of the respondent court."
*   There is some ambiguity concerning the exact grounds for the denial of the motion to set aside the probate order in SP No. Q-93-15854.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition finding no reversible error in the CA decision. The claims of the petitioners were barred by laches, mootness, and possibly estoppel. Any future actions by the Petitioners attempting to challenge the probate or partition are likely to be unsuccessful due to res judicata and other preclusive doctrines. The most significant hurdle for the Petitioners is the established validity of Juan G. Santiago's will and the appointment of his wife as administratrix.
