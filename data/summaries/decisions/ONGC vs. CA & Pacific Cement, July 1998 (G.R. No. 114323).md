Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Court of Appeals and Pacific Cement Company, Inc. (G.R. No. 114323, July 23, 1998)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court addressed the enforceability of a foreign judgment (India) in the Philippines. The foreign judgment was based on an arbitral award in favor of Petitioner ONGC against Respondent Pacific Cement, stemming from a contract for the supply of oil well cement. The cement was never delivered.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract:** Supply of oil well cement by Pacific Cement to ONGC. Payment via irrevocable letter of credit.
*   **Arbitration Clause (Clause 16):** Provided for arbitration of "questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the specification designs, drawings and instructions herein before mentioned and as to quality of workmanship of the items ordered."
*   **Jurisdiction Clause (Clause 15):** All questions, disputes and differences arising under the supply order are subject to the EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT".
*   **Arbitral Award:** Awarded ONGC US$899,603.77 plus interest and costs due to non-delivery of the oil well cement.
*   **Foreign Judgment:** Civil Judge of Dehra Dun, India, made the arbitral award "Rule of the Court," effectively converting it into a judgment.

**Liabilities:**

*   The arbitral award initially was in favor of ONGC due to the non-delivery of the cement and the lack of conformity to the specifications of the replacement cement.
*   The foreign judgment was eventually deemed enforceable in the Philippines.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of Arbitration Clause:** The central issue was whether non-delivery fell within the scope of Clause 16 (arbitration) or Clause 15 (court jurisdiction). The Supreme Court initially determined non-delivery wasn't covered by Clause 16, but the failure of the replacement cement to conform to contract specifications was, bringing it under Clause 16.
*   **Lack of Explicit Findings in Foreign Judgment:** The Court of Appeals argued the foreign judgment lacked explicit findings of fact and law, violating the constitutional requirement for reasoned decisions (Sec. 14, Art. VIII, 1987 Constitution). The Supreme Court rejected this, finding the foreign court adopted the arbitrator's detailed findings by reference.
*   **Due Process Concerns:** Pacific Cement argued denial of due process in the foreign court due to failure to receive a response regarding legal fees and alleged arbitrator bias. The Supreme Court found Pacific Cement had sufficient opportunity to be heard and the contract waived any objection to the arbitrator's alleged bias.
*   **Foreign Corporation's Capacity to Sue:** The RTC initially addressed ONGC's capacity to sue as a foreign corporation without a license but found that the isolated transaction exception applied.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 50:** Presumptive evidence of a right arising from a foreign judgment.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 131, Section 3:** Presumption of lawful exercise of jurisdiction and regular performance of official duty by a court.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 1373, 1374:** Contract interpretation principles.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 11:** Instrument construed to give effect to all provisions.
*   **Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals**

**Ambiguities:**

*   The definition of exclusive jurisdiction.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals decision and ordered Pacific Cement to pay ONGC the amounts adjudged in the foreign judgment. The Court emphasized the presumption of validity and regularity afforded to foreign judgments.
