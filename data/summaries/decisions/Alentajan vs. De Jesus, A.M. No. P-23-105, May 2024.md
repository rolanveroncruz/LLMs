**Case:** *A.M. No. P-23-105 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 18-4848-P), May 28, 2024* - Atty. Bonifacio A. Alentajan vs. Reyner S. De Jesus, Sheriff IV

**Summary:** This is an administrative case against Sheriff Reyner S. De Jesus for alleged misconduct related to the execution of a writ. The Supreme Court (SC) found De Jesus guilty of gross neglect of duty, violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars, and simple misconduct.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty:** De Jesus failed to implement an Alias Writ of Execution issued on September 15, 2017, for almost ten months (until the complaint on July 2, 2018). The SC cited *Son v. Leyva, 867 Phil. 23 (2019)*, defining gross neglect. The Court emphasized the sheriff's ministerial duty to execute writs promptly (citing *Astorga and Repol Law Offices v. Roxas*), and the unlikelihood of him not receiving the writ since it originated from his own RTC (citing *Mahusay v. Gareza, 782 Phil. 1, 8 (2016)*).

*   **Violation of Supreme Court Rules, Directives, and Circulars:** De Jesus failed to submit monthly reports on the status of writs as required by Administrative Circular No. 12 ("Guidelines and Procedure in the Service and Execution of Court Writs and Processes in the Reorganized Courts").

*   **Simple Misconduct:** De Jesus received money from the complainant (Atty. Alentajan) for publication and posting of the notice of auction sale, in violation of Canon I, Section 4 of the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel, even though he did not personally request for the money or directly receive it from the complainant.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Sheriff's duty to execute writs with "utmost dispatch" and within the time mandated by the Rules of Court.
*   Duty to submit monthly reports on writs and processes.
*   Obligation not to accept fees beyond those officially entitled.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Gross Neglect of Duty:** Fine of PHP 210,000.00
*   **Violation of Supreme Court Rules, Directives, and Circulars:** Fine of PHP 110,000.00
*   **Simple Misconduct:** Fine of PHP 110,000.00

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The court considered the fact that the sheriff did not directly solicit or receive the money from the complainant, lessening the degree of misconduct from "gross" to "simple".
*   The penalties were imposed via fines instead of suspension or dismissal due to the respondent's frontline functions.
*   The prior administrative liabilities of the respondent were considered as aggravating circumstances and doubled the fine.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 140 (as amended):**  Governs administrative proceedings against court personnel.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 12:** Guidelines for service and execution of court writs.
*   **Canon I, Section 4 of the Code of Conduct of Court Personnel:** Prohibits accepting unauthorized fees.
*   **Son v. Leyva, 867 Phil. 23 (2019):** Definition of gross neglect of duty.
*   **Mahusay v. Gareza, 782 Phil. 1, 8 (2016):** Sheriffs' responsibilities in executing court decisions.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Issues:**

*   The exact amount received by the sheriff.
*   The degree of intent in accepting the money.
