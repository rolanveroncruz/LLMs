**Case:** Office of the Court Administrator vs. Ruby M. Dalawis, Clerk of Court II, MCTC of Monkayo-Montevista, Compostela Valley.

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint for Gross Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Financial Audit:** Audit revealed significant cash shortages across multiple court funds (Fiduciary Fund, Sheriff's Trust Fund, JDF, SAJF, Mediation Fund, General Fund-New), totaling P1,903,171.00, with Dalawis accountable for P1,903,148.00.
*   **Undeposited Collections:** The shortages in JDF, SAJF, MF, and GF-New stemmed from undeposited collections between 2013-2016.
*   **Unauthorized Withdrawals:**  Shortages in FF resulted from unauthorized withdrawals. Dalawis admitted to making personal withdrawals from the Land Bank account, even though Presiding Judge signature was required. The withdrawal slips where not turned over to the Audit Team.
*   **Admission of Misappropriation:** Dalawis admitted using judiciary collections for personal use due to financial difficulties related to rural bank instability.
*   **OCA Circular Violations:** Dalawis violated OCA Circular No. 50-95 (remittance of collections), Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 (allocation of legal fees), and OCA Circular No. 113-2004 (submission of monthly reports).
*   **Restitution Failure:** Dalawis failed to fully restitute the shortages despite promises and time extensions.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty to properly manage and remit court funds.
*   Duty to adhere to Supreme Court circulars regarding financial procedures.
*   Duty of public accountability and integrity under the Constitution (Art. XI, Sec. 1).
*   Obligation to act as custodian of court funds with utmost diligence.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:** Found Guilty of Gross Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct.
*   **Financial Liability:** Ordered to restitute P1,903,148.00.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability:** OCA directed to file appropriate criminal charges.

**Penalties:**

*   Dismissal from service.
*   Forfeiture of retirement benefits.
*   Perpetual disqualification from holding public office.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article XI, Section 1:** Public office is a public trust.
*   **2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule 10, Section 50(a):** Classifies Gross Neglect of Duty and Grave Misconduct as grave offenses warranting dismissal.
*   **OCA Circular No. 50-95:** Mandates prompt remittance of judiciary collections.
*   **Amended Administrative Circular No. 35-2004:** Regulates the allocation of legal fees between the SAJF and JDF.
*   **OCA Circular No. 113-2004:** Requires submission of monthly reports of collections and deposits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Withdrawal Slips:** The failure to produce withdrawal slips raises concerns about verifying the unauthorized nature of the FF withdrawals.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The direction to file criminal charges exposes Dalawis to imprisonment and further penalties under relevant penal laws (e.g., malversation of public funds).
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** While the decision doesn't explicitly consider mitigating circumstances, potential arguments regarding economic hardship are implicitly acknowledged in Dalawis's explanation, though deemed insufficient.

**Overall:**

This document reflects a clear case of gross negligence and misconduct by the Clerk of Court in handling judiciary funds. The Supreme Court took a strong stance, imposing the maximum administrative penalties, and directing criminal prosecution.
