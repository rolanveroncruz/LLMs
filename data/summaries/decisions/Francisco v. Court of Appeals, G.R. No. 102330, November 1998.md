**Case Summary: *Francisco v. Court of Appeals*, 359 Phil. 519 (1998)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's ruling in favor of the respondents.

**Facts:** Teresita Francisco, the second wife of Eusebio Francisco, sued Conchita Evangelista, Araceli F. Marilla, Antonio V. Francisco (Eusebio's children from his first marriage), and Eusebio Francisco, seeking damages, annulment of a general power of attorney granted to Conchita Evangelista, and a declaration that she is the administratrix of alleged conjugal properties.  Teresita claimed properties acquired during her marriage to Eusebio were conjugal. The lower courts ruled the properties were Eusebio's separate capital, acquired before the second marriage or through inheritance.

**Issue:** Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that the subject properties were Eusebio Francisco's exclusive capital, and not conjugal property subject to administration by Teresita?

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Presumption of Conjugality (Art. 160, Old Civil Code):** The Court acknowledged the presumption under Article 160 that all property during the marriage is presumed conjugal. However, this presumption only applies if acquisition during the marriage is proven first.  Citing *Jocson vs. Court of Appeals, 170 SCRA 333 (1989)*
*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner (Teresita) failed to prove that the properties were acquired during her marriage to Eusebio. Citing *Cuenca vs. Cuenca, 168 SCRA 335 (1988)*
*   **Capital vs. Conjugal Property (Art. 148, Old Civil Code):** Land at Col. Cruz St. inherited by Eusebio was considered his separate property under Article 148, regardless of whether he acquired it before or during the marriage. Property owned *before* marriage or acquired *during* marriage by lucrative title (inheritance, donation) remains separate. Citing *Villanueva vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 192 SCRA 21 (1990)*
*   **Registration is Not Determinative:** The fact that the title to the San Isidro property was registered in the name of "Eusebio Francisco, married to Teresita Francisco" was insufficient to prove conjugal ownership. Registration does not confer title, merely confirms existing title. Citing *Jocson vs. Court of Appeals, supra*
*   **Repeal of Articles 158 & 160:** The Court recognized that Articles 158 and 160 of the Civil Code were repealed by the Family Code. However, it held that this repeal could not impair vested rights accrued under the Civil Code. (Art. 256, Family Code). citing *Villones vs. Employees’ Compensation Commission, 92 SCRA 320 (1979)*

**Obligations:**

*   The party claiming conjugality has the obligation to prove acquisition during the marriage.

**Liabilities:**

*   Teresita Francisco was liable for costs.
*   Teresita was sentenced to pay defendants the sum of P10,000 as and for attorney’s fees by the lower court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Weak Evidence:**  Petitioner's reliance on building permits and business licenses in her name was insufficient to prove acquisition of the properties during the marriage.
*   **Failure to Overcome Presumption of Separate Ownership:**  Private Respondents presented testimony that the properties were constructed/established during Eusebio's first marriage, and evidence was presented that confirmed he was the owner.
*   **Application of Old Civil Code:** The case hinged on the application of the Old Civil Code. The Family Code did not apply retroactively to impair vested rights.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **None highlighted in the decision.** The facts were relatively straightforward; the issue was primarily one of evidence and proper application of the law in effect at the time the rights accrued.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code, Articles 148, 158, 160
*   Family Code, Articles 105, 124, 254, 256

*   Villanueva vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 192 SCRA 21 (1990)
*   Torela vs. Torela, 93 SCRA 391 (1979).
*   Litam vs. Rivera, 100 Phil. 354 (1956)
*   Stuart vs. Yatco, 4 SCRA 1143 (1962)
*    Villones vs. Employees’ Compensation Commission, 92 SCRA 320 (1979)

**Conclusion:** This case illustrates the importance of proving the time of acquisition of property in disputes over conjugal ownership. The petitioner failed to meet her burden, and the Court upheld the separate ownership of Eusebio based on evidence of inheritance and acquisition before the second marriage.
