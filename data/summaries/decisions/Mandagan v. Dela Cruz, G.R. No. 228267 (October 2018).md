## Legal Document Summary: *Maria Nympha Mandagan v. Rufino Dela Cruz, et al.*, G.R. No. 228267

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Mandagan's petition for certiorari for availing of a wrong remedy.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Factual Background:** Mandagan's vehicle collided with an LGU-San Juan vehicle driven by Dela Cruz. She alleged negligence by Dela Cruz (unregistered vehicle, invalid driver's license), misrepresentation by Villareal regarding insurance, and subsequent failure to reimburse repair costs.
*   **Ombudsman Ruling:** Dismissed Mandagan's administrative complaint for Grave Misconduct, Gross Negligence, and Serious Dishonesty against Dela Cruz and Villareal, finding no factual or legal basis. Found presented documentation countered allegations regarding vehicle registration and driver's license validity.
*   **CA Ruling:** Dismissed Mandagan's petition for certiorari, stating that her proper remedy was a Rule 43 Petition for Review, not a Rule 65 Petition for Certiorari.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The primary issue revolves around the alleged negligence and misrepresentation of Dela Cruz and Villareal, and their potential administrative liability.
*   LGU-San Juan's obligation to ensure proper vehicle registration and driver licensing is implied.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Issue:** The main point of contention is whether Mandagan availed of the correct remedy. The Ombudsman's decision exonerating the respondents rendered the decision "final and unappealable," leading to the Supreme Court concluding that a Rule 65 Petition for Certiorari was the appropriate remedy.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Mandagan bears the burden of proving grave abuse of discretion by the Ombudsman in dismissing the administrative complaint.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989), Section 27:** Addresses the effectivity and finality of Ombudsman decisions. Specifically, findings of fact supported by substantial evidence are conclusive, and certain decisions are final and unappealable.
*   **Administrative Order No. 07, Section 7, Rule III:** Reinforces Section 27 of RA 6770, clarifying when a decision is final and unappealable, specifically in cases where the respondent is absolved.
*   ***Reyes, Jr. v. Belisario, 612 Phil. 936 (2009):*** Clarifies that while a complainant cannot appeal an exoneration of the respondent, they are not without recourse and can file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 if there is grave abuse of discretion by the Ombudsman.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in the interpretation of what constitutes "grave abuse of discretion" by the Ombudsman, which is the standard Mandagan needs to demonstrate.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court **GRANTED** Mandagan's petition, **REVERSED** the CA's resolutions, and **REMANDED** the case to the CA for resolution on the merits.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court focused on the procedural issue of the proper remedy. The decision emphasizes that while the complainant cannot appeal the Ombudsman's decision to exonerate the respondents, they can seek certiorari if they can establish that the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion. The ultimate success hinges on whether Mandagan can persuade the CA that the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the initial administrative complaint.
