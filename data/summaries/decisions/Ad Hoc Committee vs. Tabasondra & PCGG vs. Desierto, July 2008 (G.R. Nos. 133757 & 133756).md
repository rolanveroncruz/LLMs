## Legal Document Summary: *Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans vs. Ulpiano Tabasondra, et al.* and *PCGG vs. Hon. Aniano Desierto, et al.* (G.R. No. 133756 & 133757)

**Overview:** This consolidated decision involves two petitions for certiorari filed under Rule 65 challenging Orders from the Ombudsman dismissing complaints filed by the Presidential Ad Hoc Committee on Behest Loans and the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) against various individuals for violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act).  The cases stem from alleged behest loans granted by the Philippine National Bank (PNB) to Coco-Complex Philippines, Inc. (CCPI) and by the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to Philippine Journalists, Inc. (PJI).

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):** Prohibits causing undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of official functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.
*   **RA 3019, Section 3(g):** Prohibits entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction manifestly disadvantageous to the Government.
*   **Administrative Order No. 13 & Memorandum Order No. 61:** These orders established the Presidential Ad-Hoc Fact Finding Committee on Loans and defined criteria for identifying behest loans, including undercollateralization, undercapitalization of the borrower, cronyism, deviation from intended loan use, non-feasibility of project, and extraordinary speed of loan release.

**Liabilities Alleged:**

*   **PNB/DBP Directors/Officers:** Alleged to have violated Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 by approving loans to CCPI and PJI without sufficient collateral, to undercapitalized entities, and under circumstances indicative of behest lending.
*   **CCPI/PJI Officers/Stockholders:** Alleged to have conspired with bank officials to obtain loans under circumstances detrimental to the government and indicative of undue benefit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:**  A key point of contention is the prescriptive period. The Ombudsman initially dismissed one complaint (G.R. No. 133756) on the grounds of prescription, arguing the 15-year period under Section 11 of RA 3019 should be counted from the loan's grant date (1972). The Presidential Ad Hoc Committee argued for the "discovery rule," asserting prescription should run from the date the Committee discovered the alleged illegalities, referencing Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code (suppletory application).  The Supreme Court finds this issue moot, however, due to the Ombudsman later conducting a preliminary investigation after the Court settled the issue of prescription in G.R. No. 130140.
*   **Lack of Probable Cause:** The Ombudsman ultimately dismissed the PCGG complaints (G.R. No. 133757) due to "insufficiency of evidence," specifically finding that the loans were sufficiently collateralized. The Court upholds the Ombudsman's discretion in making this determination, absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Judicial Deference to Ombudsman's Discretion:** The Supreme Court emphasizes the principle of non-interference with the Ombudsman's investigatory and prosecutorial powers, absent grave abuse of discretion.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act)**
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 91:** Regarding prescription of offenses, potentially applicable suppletorily.
*   **People v. Dinsay (C.A.,40 O.G.,12th Supp. 50):** Cited by the Ombudsman, regarding prescription commencing when transactions are publicly recorded. However, it has limited controlling precedent.
*   **Presidential Ad Hoc Fact-Finding Committee on Behest Loans v. Desierto (G.R. No. 130140):**  This case settled the issue of prescription regarding behest loans and prompted the Ombudsman to conduct a preliminary investigation. It effectively mooted the question of prescription.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Discovery Rule" vs. "Date of Commission" for Prescription:** While the Court does not directly rule on the application of the discovery rule, the Ombudsman's dismissal based on sufficiency of evidence negates the need to decide on the appropriate prescriptive period.
*   **Definition of "Behest Loan":** The criteria outlined in Memorandum Order No. 61 are subject to interpretation and may be challenged regarding their application to specific loan transactions.

**Holding:**

*   G.R. No. 133756 is **dismissed as moot and academic**.
*   G.R. No. 133757 is **dismissed for lack of merit**. The Ombudsman's dismissal of the complaints due to insufficiency of evidence is affirmed.
