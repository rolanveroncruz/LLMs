**Case Summary: *Gloria Artiaga vs. Siliman University and SUMC/SUMC Foundation, Inc.* (G.R. NO. 178453, April 16, 2009)**

**Facts:**

*   Gloria Artiaga (Petitioner) was employed by Siliman University Medical Center (SUMC) as a Credit and Collection Officer.
*   Following an audit revealing irregularities under Petitioner's supervision (specifically, discrepancies in posting receipts and alleged misappropriation of funds - P300,000), SUMC issued a notice requiring her to explain within five days why disciplinary action should not be taken and preventively suspended her.
*   Petitioner submitted a letter explaining the situation and tendering her resignation.
*   More than three years later, Petitioner filed a complaint for constructive dismissal.

**Key Legal Issues:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** Whether the circumstances surrounding Petitioner's resignation constituted constructive dismissal.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Whether the NLRC erred in finding constructive dismissal based on the evidence presented.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) properly overturned the NLRC decision via Certiorari.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) **denied** the petition and **affirmed** the CA decision, which reinstated the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of the complaint. The SC held that:

*   The CA did not err in reviewing the NLRC's findings of fact because the NLRC failed to consider evidence presented by SUMC, thereby constituting grave abuse of discretion. The standard for certiorari was met.
*   Petitioner failed to substantiate her claim of constructive dismissal with sufficient evidence.
*   The Court emphasized that the letter of resignation itself revealed that she acknowledged the irregularities and was explaining the situation, thus her claim that documents were fabricated was not credible.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employee's Responsibility:** Artiaga was responsible for managing accounts receivable and posting receipts.
*   **Employer's Right to Investigate:** SUMC had the right to investigate financial irregularities and issue a notice to explain, including preventive suspension.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Artiaga's Potential Liability:**  While not explicitly determined in this case, Artiaga faced potential liability for misappropriation of funds, which precipitated the investigation.
*   **Risk of Future Similar Claims:** Without clear documentation, employers face a risk of constructive dismissal claims following employee resignation after an investigation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Standard of Review for NLRC Decisions via Certiorari:** The SC cited *Deles, Jr. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 384 Phil. 271, 283 (2000)* regarding limited review of NLRC decisions via Certiorari limited to want of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Definition of Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC cited *Muaje-Tuazon v. Wenphil Corporation, G.R. No. 162447, December 27, 2006, 511 SCRA 521, 529* regarding the commission of grave abuse of discretion when the board, tribunal or officer exercising judicial function fails to consider evidence adduced by the parties.
*   **Definition of Sufficiency of Evidence:** The SC cited *Dator v. University of Santo Tomas, G.R. No. 169464, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 677, 688; Go v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 158922, May 28, 2004, 430 SCRA 358, 366.* regarding lack of substantiation.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Aspects:**

*   **Voluntariness of Resignation:** While the court concluded the resignation was voluntary given the letter, the initial instruction to transfer duties *could* be construed as creating a hostile work environment.
*   **Lack of Due Process Claim:** Although mentioned in passing that there was a failure to consider the evidence of constructive dismissal; the court was very quick to point out that the letter of explanation/resignation of Ms. Artiaga was self-explanatory.

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the principle that employees bear the burden of proof in constructive dismissal claims. Critically, it highlights the importance of employers properly documenting investigations into employee misconduct. Finally, the case serves as a reminder that a employee's admission within a document (such as an explanation cum resignation letter) can serve as documentary evidence.
