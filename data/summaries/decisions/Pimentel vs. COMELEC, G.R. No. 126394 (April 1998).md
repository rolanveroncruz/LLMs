## Legal Document Summary: Pimentel, Jr. vs. COMELEC

**Case:** *Aquilino Q. Pimentel, Jr. vs. Commission on Elections, et al.,* G.R. No. 126394, April 24, 1998.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to nullify COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 96-2333 dismissing a complaint for violation of Section 27(b) of Republic Act No. 6646 (Electoral Reforms Law of 1987).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Discrepancy in Canvass:** The COMELEC, acting as the National Canvassing Board, discovered discrepancies between the Provincial Certificate of Canvass for Ilocos Norte and the supporting Statements of Votes regarding vote totals for senatorial candidates Enrile, Drilon, and Mitra. The Certificate of Canvass reflected higher vote totals.
*   **Complaint:** Pimentel filed a complaint against members of the Provincial Board of Canvassers and support staff, alleging violation of Section 27(b) of RA 6646.
*   **Section 27(b) RA 6646:** Penalizes two acts: (1) tampering, increasing, or decreasing votes received by a candidate, **OR** (2) refusing, after proper verification and hearing, to credit the correct votes or deduct such tampered votes.
*   **COMELEC Resolutions:**
    *   **96-1497 (May 14, 1996):** Found probable cause and ordered the filing of criminal and administrative charges against the respondents.
    *   **96-2333 (August 13, 1996):** Reversed the prior resolution, dismissing the complaint for lack of sufficient evidence to establish probable cause and only reprimanded the respondents, triggering this petition.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** The respondents claimed honest mistake, simple error, good faith, and mere ministerial duties in their counter-affidavits.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Section 27(b) RA 6646:** The respondents are potentially liable for election offenses under this section if they tampered with the votes. The critical point of contention is whether the "refusal to correct" clause is a necessary element of the offense of vote tampering.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of "Or" in Section 27(b):** The central legal issue is the interpretation of the word "or" in Section 27(b). The COMELEC seemingly interpreted it conjunctively, requiring proof of both tampering *and* refusal to correct. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that tampering and refusal to correct are two distinct, independently punishable offenses.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The COMELEC reversed its initial finding of probable cause based on a perceived lack of evidence. The Supreme Court finds this reversal to be a grave abuse of discretion, given the admission of discrepancies by at least one respondent.
*   **Mala Prohibita vs. Mala in Se; Necessity of Damage:** The COMELEC argued whether the offenses under the special law are *mala prohibita* or *mala in se*, and whether damage is a necessary element. These issues are deferred to the trial court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6646 (Electoral Reforms Law of 1987), Section 27(b):** The primary statutory basis for the charges.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** The procedural basis for the petition for certiorari.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 478 and Section 35, Chapter 12 of the Administrative Code of 1987:** Legal bases of the solicitor general's mandate.
*   **De Jesus v. People of the Philippines, 120 SCRA 760 (1983):** The case established the constitutional basis for the grant to the COMELEC, as embodied in the 1987 Constitution, of the power to investigate and prosecute election offenses as an adjunct to the enforcement and administration of all election laws.
*   **People v. Delgado, 189 SCRA 715 (199):** This trial court case confirmed jurisdiction over a criminal case charging an election offense filed by the COMELEC after conducting a preliminary investigation and finding probable cause.
*   **The Court cites Brinegar v. United States, Olivarez v. Sandiganbayan, 248 SCRA 700 (1995) and Webb v. De Leon, 247 SCRA 652 (1995):** These cases provide legal precedent on the standard for determining probable cause.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found that COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing its original resolution to file charges against the respondents. The court clarified that tampering with votes and refusing to correct the tampering are separate offenses under Section 27(b) of R.A. 6646. The dismissal of the complaint was set aside, and the original resolution to file charges was reinstated. The defenses raised by the respondents are best ventilated in the trial court.
