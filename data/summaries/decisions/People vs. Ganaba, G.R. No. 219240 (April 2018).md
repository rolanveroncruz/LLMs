## Legal Document Summary: People v. Ganaba y Nam-ay (G.R. No. 219240)

**Case Overview:** This is an appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Bryan Ganaba y Nam-ay (Accused-Appellant) for Rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Accused-Appellant was found guilty of raping a 16-year-old nanny (AAA) in his house. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately dismissed the appeal and affirmed the CA decision with modification on damages.

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Charge:** Rape under Art. 266-A RPC - Carnal knowledge of a woman through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Elements of Rape (per SC):** (1) carnal knowledge; (2) accomplished by force, intimidation, deprivation of reason, or victim being under 12 or demented.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua.

**Prosecution's Case:**
*   AAA's Testimony: She described being raped by the Accused-Appellant who used force and intimidation (knife threat).  Her testimony was deemed credible, detailed, and consistent.
*   Medical Evidence:  Dr. Chua's examination revealed "clear evidence of penetrating trauma/force to the hymen with recent penetration trauma to the Labia Majora and Minora."
*   Immediate Reporting: AAA immediately reported the incident to her brother, the barangay, and the police.

**Defense's Case:**
*   Denial and Alibi: The Accused-Appellant claimed he was watching television with his wife and denied the accusation, alleging AAA fabricated the story to extort P200,000.

**Court's Reasoning:**
*   **Credibility of Victim:** The SC emphasized the weight given to the trial court's evaluation of witness credibility in rape cases, particularly the victim's testimony. AAA's testimony was deemed credible and persuasive, corroborated by medical findings and her immediate reporting of the incident.
*   **Weakness of Defense:** The Accused-Appellant's denial and alibi were deemed weak, as he failed to prove that it was impossible for him to be at the crime scene.
*   **Victim's Testimony Sufficient:** SC reiterated that in rape cases, conviction can rest solely on the victim's credible testimony.

**Obligations:**
*   Accused-Appellant: Obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-Appellant: Obligated to pay damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**
*   The accused-appellant is held criminally liable for rape under Article 266-A of the RPC.
*   The accused-appellant is civilly liable to the victim for civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages.

**Damages Awarded (Modified by SC):**
*   Civil Indemnity: P75,000.00
*   Moral Damages: P75,000.00
*   Exemplary Damages: P75,000.00
*   6% legal interest per annum on all damages from finality of judgment until fully paid (citing *People v. Jugueta*, 783 Phil. 806 (2016)).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Minor Inconsistencies in Testimony:** While the SC acknowledged the potential for inaccuracies in rape victims' testimonies, they emphasized the overall credibility of AAA's account. A defense attorney might have tried to exploit any inconsistencies, but the court found that they were expected due to the traumatic nature of the event.
*   **Lack of Corroborating Witnesses (for the defense):** The failure of the Accused-Appellant's wife or the boarder (Erickson) to testify weakened the alibi defense.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **Article 266-A, Revised Penal Code:** Defines Rape and its elements.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):**  SC case setting the standard amounts for damages in rape cases.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7610** (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)
*   **R.A. No. 8505** (Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act of 1998)
*   **R.A. No. 9208** (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003)
*   **R.A. No. 9262** (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004)
*   **R.A. No. 9344** (Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006)

**Conclusion:** The Accused-Appellant's appeal was unsuccessful due to the credible testimony of the victim, supported by medical evidence, and the weak defense presented. The SC upheld the conviction and modified the damages awarded. This case highlights the weight given to victim testimony in rape cases and the difficulty in overcoming strong prosecution evidence with a simple denial and alibi.
