## Legal Document Summary: *Gozos v. Tac-an & People v. Tac-an* (G.R. Nos. 123191 & 123442)

**Nature:** Consolidated special civil actions for certiorari under Rule 65 seeking to annul orders of RTC Judge Tac-an related to the amendment of an information for the death of Gilbert Dyogi.

**Key Issue:** Whether Judge Tac-an acted with grave abuse of discretion/lack of jurisdiction in (1) conducting another preliminary investigation during the probable cause determination for warrants of arrest and (2) ordering the amendment of the information regarding the crime charged (from murder to homicide) and the degree of participation of the accused.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petitions, annulling Judge Tac-an's orders.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 112, Rules of Court:** Defines preliminary investigation and identifies authorized officers (prosecutors, MTC/MCTC judges, national/regional state prosecutors, and other officers authorized by law). **Judges of Regional Trial Courts were found not to be included in this list.**
*   **RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989):** Grants investigators of the Office of the Ombudsman the power to conduct preliminary investigations of public officers, concurrent with public prosecutors.
*   **Art. III, Sec. 2, 1987 Constitution:** Addressed the required probable cause for issuing search/arrest warrants, which lies within the discretion of the court.

**Liabilities & Participants:**

*   **Private Respondents:** SPO2 Jaime Blanco (initially charged with murder), SPO3 Pedro Castillo, SPO3 Ciriaco Sulit, SPO4 Aniano Atienza, and SPO1 Ildefonso Castillo (all members of PNP San Jose, Batangas).
*   **Petitioners:** Oscar Gozos (Presiding Prosecutor of Batangas), Edna Dyogi (complainant/victim's relative), and the People of the Philippines (represented by the Solicitor General).
*   **Respondent:** Judge Paterno Tac-an, RTC Batangas City.
*   **Gerald Varez:** Investigator of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Military, filed the initial murder information.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge's Overreach:** The core issue is the judge exceeding his authority by conducting what amounted to a second preliminary investigation and dictating the charges and participation levels.  The SC reiterates the distinction between the **determination of probable cause for arrest warrants (judicial)** and the **preliminary investigation for determining whether to hold for trial (executive).** *People v. Inting* (187 SCRA 788) is crucial.
*   **Motion to Quash:** The Court notes the private respondents' attempt to quash the information lacked the basis under Rule 117, Sec. 3. A lack of probable cause is not grounds for a motion to quash under this rule, and is rather an issue that needs to be disproven at trial.
*   **Misinterpretation of Constitutional Provision:** Judge's reliance on Art. III, Sec. 2 of the Constitution was misplaced, as it applies specifically to the issuance of warrants, not the scope of the preliminary investigation itself.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The judge ordering the prosecutor to amend the information was improper, as the decision to prosecute and the specific charges are generally within the prosecutor's discretion.

**Case Law:**

*   **Castillo v. Villaluz, 171 SCRA 39:** Affirms that RTC judges no longer have the authority to conduct preliminary investigations.
*   **Salta v. Court of Appeals, 143 SCRA 228:** Clarifies that preliminary investigation is an executive, not judicial, function.
*   **People v. Inting, 187 SCRA 788:** Distinguishes between preliminary investigation for the information and the determination of probable cause for arrest.
*   **Cruz v. People, 233 SCRA 439:** Further defined the requirements for a preliminary investigation.

**Ambiguities:** The factual circumstances of the shooting are not fully resolved by this decision, as the focus is on the procedural impropriety of the judge's actions. The degree of participation of each defendant remained in contention, as well as the details surrounding the acquisition and firing of the weapon.

**Summary of Impact:** The SC reaffirms the separation of powers, holding that a judge cannot usurp the prosecutorial function by redetermining probable cause and dictating the charges filed. This decision reinforces the principle that preliminary investigations, beyond the determination of probable cause for arrest warrants, are an executive branch function. The annulment of the judge's orders means the case reverts to the prosecutor to proceed appropriately.
