**Case Summary: Philippine Savings Bank vs. Chowking Food Corporation (G.R. No. 177526, July 4, 2008)**

**Facts:**

*   Chowking issued five PSBank checks to Joe Kuan Food Corp.
*   Chowking's acting accounting manager, Rino Manzano, endorsed and encashed the checks at PSBank's Bustos branch.  The checks were honored with only Manzano's endorsement, lacking other authorized signatures.
*   Manzano absconded with the funds. Chowking sought reimbursement from PSBank, which was denied.
*   Chowking sued PSBank (and officers Abacan and Santos) for sum of money and damages.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Liability for Negligence:** The core issue is which party is liable for the loss due to the unauthorized encashment.
*   **Estoppel:** PSBank argues Chowking is estopped from claiming reimbursement due to its alleged negligence in allowing Manzano to handle and encash checks. This defense was rejected by the court.
*   **Proximate Cause:** PSBank contends Chowking's negligence was the proximate cause of the loss. The court ruled that it was PSBank's negligence in supervision of employees was the proximate cause of loss.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The Court of Appeals (CA) found PSBank and its employee, Santos, solidarily liable under Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code for negligence.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision with modification by deleting attorney's fees, exemplary damages, and unrealized profits of the appellant.
*   PSBank liable to Chowking for the amount of the checks, plus interest at the rate of 12% per annum from August 15, 1989 until said amount shall have been paid.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **PSBank:**  Obligation to exercise a high degree of diligence in handling depositor accounts and supervising employees (citing *Westmont Bank v. Ong*, *Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Court of Appeals*). Duty to treat accounts of depositors with meticulous care. Duty to verify endorsements and signatures.
*   **Chowking:** While Chowking allowed Manzano to previously encash its checks, it has always been accompanied with the endorsements of the other authorized signatories.

**Liabilities:**

*   **PSBank:** Primary liability for allowing payment on checks to a wrongful payee due to the bank's failure to exercise reasonable business prudence and follow internal banking regulations.
*   **Erlinda O. Santos:** Liable for damages due to negligence, particularly in cashing checks without proper endorsements. Solidary liability with PSBank.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Vicarious Liability:** PSBank faces vicarious liability for the negligent acts of its employee (Santos) under Article 2180 of the Civil Code.  The bank failed to prove it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in supervising its employees.
*   **Reputational Risk:**  Adverse publicity and loss of public trust and confidence in the banking industry.
*   **Operational Risks:**  Inadequate internal controls and monitoring procedures, leading to potential fraud and losses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Caltex (Philippines ), Inc. v. Court of Appeals* - Doctrine of equitable estoppel
*   *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Casa Montessori Internationale* -  Liability of drawee bank for allowing payment on checks with wrongful payee.
*   *Philippine Bank of Commerce v. Court of Appeals* -  Bank's negligence in selection and supervision of employees as proximate cause of loss.
*   *Bataclan v. Medina* - Definition of proximate cause.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code, Articles 2176 and 2180:**  Basis for solidary liability due to negligence.
*   **Republic Act No. 8791 (General Banking Law of 2000):** Requires banks to adhere to the highest standards of integrity and performance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition and application of "proximate cause" are often contentious.  The courts ultimately determined that PSBank's lack of diligence was the primary cause, despite Chowking's possible contributory negligence.
*   The degree of negligence attributable to Chowking.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The ruling emphasizes the higher standard of care required of banks due to the public interest involved.
*   The "last clear chance" doctrine, though cited by the CA, isn't explicitly discussed by the SC.
*   The SC focuses on the bank's failure to properly supervise its employees and adhere to internal controls as the key factor in establishing liability.
