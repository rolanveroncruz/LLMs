## Legal Document Summary: *Ilusorio v. Bildner, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 173935-38 (2008)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Whether statements made in pleadings (Petitions for Issuance of New Owner's Duplicate Titles) are absolutely privileged and immune from criminal prosecution for perjury. Collaterally, the decision addresses the issue of proper venue in perjury cases.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charges:** Perjury charges filed against respondents (Bildner, et al.) for allegedly making false statements in verified petitions filed in Makati and Tagaytay RTCs to obtain new owner's duplicate titles for Lakeridge Development Corp. (LDC) properties.
*   **False Statement:** The core alleged falsehood was the respondents' claim that the original titles were lost, when petitioner (Ilusorio) claimed to possess them.
*   **Lower Court Rulings:** The MeTC quashed the Informations, affirmed by the RTC, based on the privilege of pleadings doctrine, citing *Flordelis v. Himalalaon* and *People v. Aquino*.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* the petition on the ground that the MeTC of Pasig lacked *jurisdiction* due to *improper venue*. The correct venue was Makati and Tagaytay, where the alleged false statements were relevant to the judicial proceedings.
*   **Privilege of Pleadings (Dicta):** The Supreme Court, addressed the issue of whether the petitions were absolutely privileged, stating that both the MeTC and the RTC misapplied the rulings in *Flordelis v. Aquino* because Respondents' petitions are required by law to be under oath.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents had an obligation to make truthful statements in their sworn petitions.

**Liabilities:**

*   The decision implies potential criminal liability for perjury if proven, but only within the proper venue.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The respondents may still face perjury charges if filed in the correct venue (Makati and Tagaytay).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 183 of the Revised Penal Code (Perjury):** Defines the elements of perjury.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   ***Flordelis v. Himalalaon* (1978)**: Lower courts erroneously relied on this case, as here the sworn statement complained of is required by law.
*   ***People v. Aquino* (1966)**: Lower courts erroneously relied on this case, as here the sworn statement complained of is required by law.
*   ***United States v. Ca√±et* (1915)**: Held that the "gist of the offense charged is not the making of the affidavit... but the intentional giving of false evidence."
*   ***Choa v. People* (2003)**: Stated the cases of *Sison* and *Aquino* involve libel cases.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the privilege of pleadings doctrine to perjury cases remains contentious. The Court rejects its application here but does not provide definitive guidance on its scope.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The decision underscores the jurisdictional nature of venue in criminal cases.
*   The elements of perjury, per *Saavedra, Jr. v. Department of Justice*, are restated.
*   The importance of where the alleged untruthful statement was *materially used* is emphasized in determining venue.
