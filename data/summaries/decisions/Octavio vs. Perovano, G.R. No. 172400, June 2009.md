**Legal Document Summary: *Octavio vs. Perovano*, G.R. No. 172400, June 23, 2009**

**Nature of the Document:** This is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Court of Appeals' denial of a petition challenging the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) over a forcible entry case involving a parcel of land allegedly covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Ownership Claim:** Enrico Perovano (Respondent) claims ownership of Lot No. 412 in Talisay City under TCT No. T-179767.
*   **Forcible Entry Allegations:** Enrico alleges that Zosimo Octavio and Jesus Albona (Petitioners), with the involvement of MARO Dolores Gulmatico, forcibly entered the land, plowed it, and began planting sugarcane.
*   **CARP Coverage Claim:** Petitioners contend the land was voluntarily offered for sale (VOS) to the DAR by Estefania Perovano (Enrico's mother) in 1992, placing it under CARP (RA 6657). They claim they were identified as qualified farmer-beneficiaries and a Memorandum of Agreement allowed them to possess and cultivate the land after LBP payment to Estefania.
*   **MTCC Decision:** Ruled in favor of Enrico, ordering Petitioners to vacate the land, remove improvements, stop cultivation, pay rental fees, and attorney's fees.
*   **RTC and CA Affirmed:** Both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed the MTCC's decision.
*   **DARAB Decision:** The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) had earlier ruled that Zosimo and Jesus are not recognized farmer-beneficiaries

**Legal Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** Whether the case is an ejectment suit (MTCC jurisdiction) or an agrarian dispute (DAR jurisdiction).
*   **CARP Coverage and Validity of Subsequent Transactions:** The validity of the conveyance of the lot from Estefania to Enrico and any subsequent transactions, given the CARP coverage.
*   **Farmer-Beneficiary Status:** Whether the Petitioners are legitimately installed farmer-beneficiaries.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court held that the MTCC had jurisdiction because the case was primarily an ejectment suit based on the material allegations of the complaint regarding possession de facto.
*   The Court affirmed that the land is covered by CARP, but this fact alone does not divest the regular courts of jurisdiction in an ejectment case.
*   The Court deferred to the DARAB's finding that the Petitioners are not recognized farmer-beneficiaries, emphasizing that factual findings by administrative agencies are generally accorded great respect.
*   The Supreme Court characterized petitioners as mere usurpers and upheld the lower court's ruling that the action was one for ejectment, properly falling under the MTCC's jurisdiction.

**Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1998):** Basis of the argument for DAR jurisdiction and farmer-beneficiary status.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), as amended by RA 7691:** Grants MTCs exclusive original jurisdiction over forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases.
*   **Section 50 of RA 6657:** Vests the DAR with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Rimasug v. Martin* (G.R. No. 160118, November 22, 2005): Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint, not the defenses.
*   *Rivera v. Santiago* (G.R. No. 146501, August 28, 2003): MTC jurisdiction over ejectment and Revised Rules on Summary Procedure apply.
*   *Amurao v. Villalobos* (G.R. No. 157491, June 20, 2006): Definition of an agrarian dispute.
*   *Pasong Bayabas Farmers Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 142359, May 25, 2004): Deference to administrative agencies' factual findings.
*   *Sta. Rosa Realty v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 112526 & 118338, September 28, 2005): Identification of farmer-beneficiaries is a function of the DAR.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Collateral Attack on DARAB Decision:** The Petitioners' attempt to claim farmer-beneficiary status could be construed as a collateral attack on the DARAB decision finding them not to be farmer-beneficiaries.
*   **Lack of CLOA:** The Petitioners' lack of a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) significantly weakens their claim to farmer-beneficiary status.
*   **Finality of DARAB Decision:** The implications of the DARAB decision and its potential impact on any future agrarian reform claims by the Petitioners need careful consideration.
*   **"Threat, Intimidation, Strategy and Stealth" allegation:** The specific facts supporting this should be well established.
