**Legal Document Summary: *Daylinda Albarracin v. Philippine Transworld Shipping Corp.* G.R. No. 210791**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that reversed the NLRC's award of death benefits to the petitioner.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract:** POEA-SEC employment contract (9 months) for seafarer Rex Miguelito Albarracin as Second Officer.
*   **Illness & Death:** Albarracin diagnosed with Hepatitis B and suspected Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) post-employment. He died approximately 10 months after repatriation.
*   **Claim:** Widow filed for death benefits, medical expenses, and attorney's fees.
*   **Employer's Defense:** Death occurred after contract expiration, illness not work-related, failure to undergo post-employment medical examination within 3 days of disembarkation, and HCC typically contracted via Hepatitis B (blood transfusion or sexual contact).
*   **Labor Arbiter Ruling:** Dismissed the complaint (death after contract termination, no work-relatedness, failure to undergo post-employment medical exam).
*   **NLRC Ruling:** Reversed Labor Arbiter (presumption of work-relatedness under POEA-SEC Section 20-B(4) for unlisted illnesses).
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed NLRC, reinstating Labor Arbiter decision. CA found no causal link between Albarracin's job and HCC, noting Hepatitis B-related cause of death.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer Obligations:** The POEA-SEC outlines obligations regarding death benefits for work-related deaths/illnesses *during* the contract. The core issue is whether the death is compensable given it occurred *after* the contract ended.
*   **Petitioner's Burden:** To prove a work-related illness or aggravation contributing to death, even after the contract expired (per POEA-SEC Section 32-A), by way of "substantial evidence."

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Work-Relatedness of HCC:** The critical point of contention is whether Albarracin's work as Second Officer contributed to the development or acceleration of HCC. The petitioner's claim is based on exposure to toxic substances, while the employer argues limited exposure in the Second Officer role.
*   **Causation:** Proving causation between work environment and HCC is difficult. The CA emphasized the Hepatitis B connection, weakening the work-related argument.
*   **3-Day Post-Employment Medical Exam:** Albarracin's failure to undergo this exam weakens the claim, as it is often a requirement in death benefit cases involving seafarers. The court relies on *Sea Power Shipping Enterprises, Inc. v. Salazar* (716 Phil. 693, 705 (2013)) which cites requirements to prove the work-related connection.
*   **Presumption of Work-Relatedness:** POEA-SEC Section 20-B(4) provides a disputable presumption for unlisted illnesses, but this presumption is not a "free pass". *Maersk-Filipinas Crewing, Inc. v. Malicse*, G.R. Nos. 200576 & 200626, reinforces claimant's burden.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (Philippine Overseas Employment Administration - Standard Employment Contract):** Core contract defining terms and obligations.
*   **POEA-SEC Section 20(A):** Death benefits for work-related death during the contract term.
*   **POEA-SEC Section 20(B)(4):** Disputable presumption of work-relatedness for unlisted illnesses.
*   **POEA-SEC Section 32-A:** Compensation for death after contract termination due to work-related illness (requires proof of causation and risk exposure). The court specifically cited the *Sea Power Shipping* case.
*   **Nemaria v. Employees Compensation Commission (G.R. No. L-57889):** Petitioner's reliance on this case regarding liver cancer as work-connected was rejected due to lack of substantial evidence.
*   **Maersk-Filipinas Crewing, Inc. v. Malicse (G.R. Nos. 200576 & 200626):**  Clarifies that claimants must *substantiate* claims despite the presumption in Section 20(B).
*   **Aya-Ay, Sr. v. Arpaphil Shipping Corp. 516 Phil. 641 (2006):** Expert medical evidence needed to establish nexus of disease.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's denial of benefits. The key factor was the petitioner's failure to provide "substantial evidence" linking Albarracin's HCC to his work environment. The timing of death post-employment, the Hepatitis B association, and the lack of documented illness during employment all contributed to the unfavorable outcome for the petitioner. The *burden of proof* lies with the claimant, even with the disputable presumption of work relatedness, they must substantiate this claim with substantial evidence of the work environment and risks.
