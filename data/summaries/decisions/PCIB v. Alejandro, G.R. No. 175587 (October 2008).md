**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Joseph Anthony M. Alejandro***

**Case:** G.R. No. 175587, October 24, 2008 (Resolving Motion for Reconsideration)

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB)
*   Respondent: Joseph Anthony M. Alejandro

**Key Issue:** Adequacy of Damages Awarded to Respondent due to wrongful garnishment of deposits.

**Summary:**

This Resolution addresses the Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration seeking increased damages (moral, nominal, exemplary, and attorney's fees) following a prior Decision holding the bank liable for wrongful attachment. The Supreme Court *denied* the motion, affirming the original award as adequate.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Nominal Damages:** Affirmed at P50,000.00. Based on the 2-month period respondent was deprived of using his deposits. *Almeda v. Cariño* (G.R. No. 152143, January 13, 2003) cited for the principle that nominal damages are to vindicate a right, not to indemnify for losses.
*   **Moral Damages:** Affirmed at P500,000.00. The court found the respondent's evidence insufficient to justify a higher award. The court requires "competent and substantial proof" of suffering to justify a higher award of moral damages, or it would be considered a penalty rather than compensation (*Quezon City Government v. Dacara* (G.R. No. 150304, June 15, 2005)).
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Affirmed at P500,000.00, deemed sufficient to deter the bank from unfounded attachment applications, but not to unjustly enrich the respondent. (*Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 116181, April 17, 1996).
*   **Attorney's Fees:**  Implicitly affirmed at P200,000. The court found Respondent's claim of attorney's fees of P1 million was excessive considering the simplicity of the case. The court also found evidence of counsel's professional standing as inadmissible at motion for reconsideration phase.

**Liabilities:**

*   PCIB remains liable for the previously awarded damages (moral, nominal, exemplary, and attorney's fees).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Moral Damages:** The decision underscores the high burden of proof required to establish moral damages. Reliance on self-serving allegations is insufficient. This raises a risk for future plaintiffs seeking moral damages who cannot provide sufficient evidence.
*   **Determination of Nominal Damages:** The court's reliance on the "period of deprivation" to calculate nominal damages is a potential area of debate. There could be arguments for alternative methods of calculation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Almeda v. Cariño** (G.R. No. 152143, January 13, 2003): Principle of nominal damages.
*   **Quezon City Government v. Dacara** (G.R. No. 150304, June 15, 2005): Proof needed for moral damages.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals** (G.R. No. 116181, April 17, 1996): Purpose of exemplary damages.
*   Implied reference to the Civil Code provisions on Damages, especially moral, nominal and exemplary. Rules on admissibility of evidence also implied.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld its original decision on damages. This case is significant as it reinforces the need for concrete evidence to support claims for moral damages and highlights the court's reluctance to award excessive damages based solely on assertions of social standing or the amount of the attachment bond. The case is now final.
