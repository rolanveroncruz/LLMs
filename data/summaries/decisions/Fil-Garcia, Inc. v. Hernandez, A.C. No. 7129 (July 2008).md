**Legal Document Summary: A.C. No. 7129, Fil-Garcia, Inc. v. Atty. Hernandez**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Fernando Cresente C. Hernandez for malpractice, gross misconduct, and violation of lawyer's oath.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:** Fil-Garcia, Inc. sued Magdalena Villasi for sum of money/damages related to a construction agreement. RTC ruled in favor of Fil-Garcia; CA reversed, ordering Fil-Garcia to pay Villasi.
*   **Respondent's Involvement:** Atty. Hernandez substituted Atty. Ligsay as counsel for Fil-Garcia at the CA level (Motion for Reconsideration). CA denied Fil-Garcia's Motion.
*   **Procedural Lapses:**
    *   Atty. Hernandez filed three successive motions for extension of time to file a Petition for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court.
    *   The first motion was denied by the Supreme Court for failure to state material dates (receipt of CA decision and motion for reconsideration). *This demonstrates a lack of familiarity with basic procedural rules.*
    *   The second and third motions were denied because the first motion had already been denied.
    *   Petition for Review filed late; appeal lost.
*   **Delay in Notification:** Atty. Hernandez received the Supreme Court's denial of the appeal in November 2001 but only informed Fil-Garcia in June 2002 (7-month delay).

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 18, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Duty to serve client with competence and diligence.
*   **Rule 18.03, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Duty not to neglect a legal matter entrusted to him. *Negligence renders the lawyer liable.*
*   **Rule 18.04, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Duty to keep the client informed of the status of the case and respond within a reasonable time to the client's requests for information.
*   **General Duty of Diligence:** Duty to be acquainted with rudiments of law and procedure and exercise due diligence to inform himself of the Court's action on motions.

**Liabilities:**

*   Disciplinary action as a lawyer. IBP recommended suspension of six months.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Malpractice Claim:** While this is a disciplinary proceeding, the facts could support a civil claim for malpractice, especially if Fil-Garcia suffered financial damages due to the lost appeal.
*   **Damages:** Financial loss suffered by client due to the negligence of the attorney.
*   **Further Disciplinary Action:** Aggravating factors could lead to a more severe penalty.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals by certiorari to the Supreme Court. *Violation for failing to take appeal within reglementary period and not stating material date of filing of motion for reconsideration of the CA decision*
*   **Rule 56, Rules of Court:** Supplements Rule 45 regarding appeals to the Supreme Court.
*   **Canon 18, Rules 18.03, 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:** Foundational basis for the ethical violations.
*   **Barbuco v. Beltran, A.C. No. 5092, August 11, 2004:** Cited regarding the duty to provide full attention, skill, and competence.
*   **Diman v. Hon. Alumbres, 359 Phil. 796, 803 (1998):** Motions for extension of time are discretionary and the movant must diligently inquire about the Court's action.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The respondent's defense that the filing of motions for extension of time is allowed under Section 2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. *This argument is weak because it ignores the subsequent denial of the motions due to failure to follow requirements.*
*   Respondent's claim that the delay was not deliberate, prompted by malice, or intent to injure the complainant. *This is mitigating, but does not excuse the negligence.*

**Overall Assessment:**

Atty. Hernandez committed serious procedural errors, neglected his client's case, and failed to keep his client informed. The successive, flawed motions for extension, the missed deadline, and the seven-month delay in notification constitute clear violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The Supreme Court upheld the IBP's findings, affirming the suspension from the practice of law for six months. The attorney's conduct was negligent, unprofessional, and detrimental to his client's interests.
