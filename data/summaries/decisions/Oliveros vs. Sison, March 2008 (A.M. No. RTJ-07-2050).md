## Legal Document Summary: Oliveros vs. Sison (A.M. No. RTJ-07-2050)

**Nature:** Resolution on Motion for Partial Reconsideration in an Administrative Matter

**Parties:**
*   **Complainants:** Spouses Arleen and Lorna Oliveros
*   **Respondent:** Judge Dionisio C. Sison

**Subject Matter:**  Gross ignorance of the law by Judge Sison in issuing an indirect contempt order against the Oliveros spouses.  The subsequent concealment of a related Petition for Certiorari filed with the Court of Appeals by the Oliveros spouses.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Judge Sison (Original Decision):** Found guilty of gross ignorance of the law for failing to comply with Rule 71, Section 4 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure regarding indirect contempt. Specifically, he failed to require a verified petition for contempt and summarily issued a warrant of arrest. Fined P10,000.00.
*   **Rule 71, Section 4 (Revised Rules on Civil Procedure):** Requires indirect contempt charges to be commenced by verified petition (unless initiated *motu proprio* by the court with a show-cause order).
*   **Oliveros Spouses (Current Resolution):**  Directed to show cause why they should not be cited for contempt for violating Section 5, Rule 7 of the Revised Rules on Civil Procedure (Certification against Forum Shopping).
*   **Rule 7, Section 5 (Revised Rules on Civil Procedure):** Requires parties to disclose pending or subsequently filed related actions.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Judge Sison:** Already sanctioned with a fine for gross ignorance of the law. The Motion for Partial Reconsideration was denied.
*   **Oliveros Spouses:** Face potential citation for contempt of court due to non-disclosure of the CA petition which questioned the same contempt order that formed the basis of the administrative complaint against Judge Sison. The certification against forum shopping was potentially violated by failing to disclose that the administrative case was already pending.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Rules on Civil Procedure, Rule 71, Section 4:**  Establishes the procedure for initiating indirect contempt proceedings. Crucial to the initial finding against Judge Sison.
*   **Revised Rules on Civil Procedure, Rule 7, Section 5:** Relates to the obligation to disclose related cases (forum shopping). This is the basis for potentially holding Oliveros spouses in contempt.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Judge Sison's Argument (Rejected):** Claimed his actions constituted substantial compliance with Rule 71, Section 4, arguing the Motion to Cite for Contempt served as sufficient notice. This was deemed insufficient, as it circumvented the procedural requirements for indirect contempt.
*   **Oliveros Spouses' Argument (Potentially Unsuccessful):** Claimed lack of awareness regarding the obligation to disclose the CA petition. The Court considered the signed Verification/Certification in the CA petition as evidence to the contrary.

**Legal Precision:**

*   **Gross Ignorance of the Law:**  A ground for disciplinary action against judges. This was the basis for the initial penalty.
*   **Indirect Contempt:**  Disobedience or resistance to a lawful order of the court. The underlying issue that triggered both the judge's error and the subsequent potential contempt by the Oliveros spouses.
*   **Forum Shopping:**  Filing multiple actions involving the same issues to increase the chances of a favorable outcome. The Oliveros' failure to disclose the related CA petition is the basis for the current contempt inquiry.

**Potential Next Steps:**

*   **Oliveros Spouses:**  Will need to file a Show Cause pleading arguing against being held in contempt.
*   **Court:** Will evaluate the Oliveros' response and determine whether their failure to disclose the CA petition constitutes contempt of court.
