**Legal Document Summary: *Melba Alcantara Denusta v. Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, et al. (G.R. No. 264158, January 31, 2024)***

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of petitioner's Certiorari petition for being filed beyond the reglementary period. The underlying dispute concerns a complaint for illegal dismissal, underpayment of salaries, damages, and attorney's fees filed by an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) against a recruitment agency (Migrant), its foreign principal (K&G), and the agency's president (Ceralde).

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Petitioner was hired as a Kitchen Hand in Cook Islands with a specific weekly salary (NZ$400), accommodation, and other benefits.
*   **Breach of Contract:** Petitioner alleges underpayment of wages, failure to provide accommodation, and maltreatment by the foreign employer's family, specifically Vaine.
*   **Constructive Dismissal Claim:** Petitioner claims she was constructively dismissed due to the unbearable working conditions and breach of contract.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** Respondents argued petitioner was a "name-hire" (disputed), and that she breached her obligations and asked to be released from the employment contract.
*   **Labor Arbiter (LA) Ruling:** Initially ruled in favor of the petitioner, finding illegal dismissal based on text messages and breach of contract, awarding salary for the unexpired portion of the contract, salary differentials, moral & exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** Reversed the LA's ruling on illegal dismissal, finding that the petitioner wasn't illegally dismissed and removing all claims except for salary differential and attorney's fees.
*   **CA Ruling:** Dismissed the Petition for Certiorari due to untimely filing, holding that the 60-day period is non-extendible.

**Key Legal Issues & Court's Ruling:**

1.  **Timeliness of Certiorari Petition:** The Supreme Court (SC) found that the CA erred in not granting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which presented compelling reasons hindering timely filing. Cites *Fluor Daniel, Inc.-Philippines v. Fil-Estate Properties, Inc.* and *Castells, et al. v. Saudi Arabian Airlines* regarding when the period to file a petition for certiorari may be extended.
2.  **Constructive Dismissal:** The SC ruled that the petitioner was constructively dismissed. The foreign employer's actions (breach of contract, verbal abuse, threat with a knife) created an intolerable working environment, compelling her to terminate her employment.
    *   Applies the definition of constructive dismissal as found in *Macali v. Baliwag Lechon Manok, Inc.* and *Lagamayo v. Cullinan Group, Inc.*
    *   Notes that factual findings can be reviewed when lower tribunals conflict (*Dela Fuente v. Gimenez*).
3.  **Monetary Claims:** Based on illegal dismissal under RA 8042 (as amended by RA 10022), the SC reinstated salary for the unexpired portion of the contract and reimbursement of placement fees. The SC also upheld salary differentials, increased moral and exemplary damages, and awarded attorney's fees.
    *   Reiterates the unconstitutionality of the "three months per year" limitation in RA 8042 based on *Sameer Overseas Placement Agency, Inc. v. Cabiles*.
    *   Cites case law on damages in illegal dismissal cases (*Ascent Skills Human Resources Services, Inc. v. Manuel* and *Jacob v. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc.*).
4.  **Interest:** Applies 6% interest per annum on the total monetary awards from the finality of the Decision until fully paid (*Lara's Gifts & Decors, Inc. v. Midtown Industrial Sales, Inc.*).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Migrant Workers Manpower Agency, Inc., K&G Manpower Services Ltd., and Theresita M. Ceralde:** Jointly and severally liable for the unexpired portion of the contract (20 months), salary differentials, reimbursement of placement fees (PHP 90,000), moral damages (PHP 50,000), exemplary damages (PHP 25,000), and attorney's fees (10% of the total monetary award).
*   **Employer's Duty:** The Court emphasizes the employer's duty to provide a safe and fair working environment.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Computation of Unexpired Salary:** The precise amount needs to be computed by the Labor Arbiter based on the contractual rate. Conversion rates for NZD to PHP will be crucial at time of payment.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the judgment against the foreign principal (K&G) may present jurisdictional and practical challenges.
*   **Proof of Accommodation/Transportation:** The petitioner's failure to provide adequate substantiation for claims regarding expenses of these two may affect the total amount of monetary benefit awarded.
