Here's a concise legal summary of the *Mercene v. GSIS* case:

**Case:** *Floro Mercene v. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)*, G.R. No. 192971, January 10, 2018.

**Issue:** Whether the CA erred in reversing the RTC decision quieting title in favor of Mercene by cancelling the mortgages annotated on his TCT based on prescription.

**Facts:** Mercene obtained two loans from GSIS in 1965 and 1968 secured by real estate mortgages on his Quezon City property.  In 2004, Mercene filed a complaint to quiet title, alleging GSIS never exercised its rights and the right to foreclose had prescribed. The RTC granted the complaint. The CA reversed, finding prescription had not commenced.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court *denied* Mercene's petition, affirming the CA decision dismissing the complaint for quieting of title.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Prescription of Mortgage:** The core issue is the prescriptive period for foreclosing a mortgage.  The Court reiterated that prescription runs from the *accrual of the cause of action*, not merely the date of execution (citing *University of Mindanao, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas*).
*   **Accrual of Cause of Action:** The cause of action accrues upon default of the mortgagor, specifically when demand is made and refused, or when demand is unnecessary due to express stipulation, legal provision, or other circumstances.
*   **Failure to State a Cause of Action:** Mercene's complaint was deficient because it failed to allege the loan's maturity date, whether demand was necessary, or that a demand had been made by GSIS. This failure to plead the ultimate facts necessary to establish prescription was fatal.
*   **Judicial Admission:** Mercene argued GSIS judicially admitted prescription by failing to specifically deny his allegation that GSIS's right to foreclose had prescribed. The Court rejected this, holding that the allegation of prescription in the complaint was a *conclusion of law*, not a material fact.  Failure to deny a conclusion of law does not constitute an admission.
*   **Failure to Specifically Deny:**  The court reiterated that only material allegations of *fact* need to be specifically denied to be deemed admitted; conclusions of law do not. (citing *Cua v. Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc.*)

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Article 1142, New Civil Code:** Implies the prescriptive period of 10 years.
*   **Rule 8, Sections 1 and 10, Rules of Court:** Regarding specific denials of allegations in pleadings.
*   **Rule 68, Rules of Court** Regarding foreclosure.
*   **Act No. 3135** Regarding Extra-judicial Foreclosure.
*   *University of Mindanao, Inc. v. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, et al.*, G.R. Nos. 194964-65, January 11, 2016: Established the accrual of cause of action and commencement of prescription period.
*   *Maybank Philippines, Inc. v. Spouses Tarrosa*, 771 Phil. 423 (2015):  Explains the concept of "default" and when the right to foreclose accrues.
*   *Abad v. Court of First Instance of Pangasinan*, 283 Phil. 500, 515 (1992): Reiterated the difference between ultimate facts and conclusions of law.
*   *Cua v. Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc.*, 690 Phil. 491, 501 (2012). regarding the implication of failure to deny specifically.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Maturity Date & Demand:** The critical missing information regarding the maturity date of the loans and the necessity/occurrence of demand remains a factual ambiguity. The case hinges on Mercene's failure to *plead* these facts, not necessarily that they *did not exist*. If evidence exists that GSIS *did* make a demand more than ten years before the complaint, and the loan had matured at the time the demand was made, there could still be a question of prescription, despite the ruling.
*   **GSIS's Delay:** While the court focused on Mercene's pleading deficiency, a further line of inquiry might examine whether GSIS's inaction for an extended period prejudiced Mercene.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court's decision emphasizes the importance of properly pleading all essential elements of a cause of action. The ruling highlights the distinction between factual allegations and legal conclusions in pleadings and their implications for judicial admissions. Mercene's failure to sufficiently plead the accrual of the cause of action for prescription proved fatal to his claim.
