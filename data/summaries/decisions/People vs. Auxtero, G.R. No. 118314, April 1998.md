## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Auxtero*, G.R. No. 118314

This is a criminal appeal from a Regional Trial Court conviction for rape under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 2632 & 4111). The accused, Ernesto Auxtero, was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of raping a 14-year-old girl, Ruth Tutor, and sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered to pay Php 50,000.00 in damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Rape, defined and penalized under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended).
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion Perpetua*, Php 50,000.00 indemnity.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay the ordered indemnity.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for rape.
*   Civil liability for damages to the victim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Contradictory Statements:** The defense argued the victim's testimony was inconsistent, citing her sworn statement allegedly stating lack of penetration, conflicting with her court testimony.
*   **Lack of Ruptured Hymen:** The defense pointed to the intact hymen, however, the court deemed it not negating to penetration.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The defense witnesses had ties with the accused by consanguinity or affinity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended):** Defines and penalizes rape.
*   **People v. Sergio Betonio, G.R. No. 119165, Sept. 24, 1997:** Established the three principles guiding appellate court review in rape cases (ease of accusation, need for extreme caution in scrutinizing victim testimony, prosecution evidence must stand on its own merits).
*   **People v. Gomez, G.R. No. 112074, September 29, 1997:** Affirms deference to trial court findings on witness credibility due to the opportunity to observe demeanor firsthand.
*   **People v. Gagto, 253 SCRA 455, 463 (1996):** Established that a medical report isn't always necessary to convict of rape.
*   **People v. Ariston Pardillo, Jr., G.R. No. 119543, Nov. 28, 1997:** Confirmed the implausibility that a victim would fabricate a tale of defloration.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The core issue is whether the prosecution proved the rape beyond reasonable doubt, particularly the element of penetration given the intact hymen and alleged inconsistencies in the victim's statements.
*   Defense counsel raised credibility issues regarding the victim, citing the improbability that no one heard her cries for help.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC conviction. The court prioritized the victim's straightforward testimony, coupled with corroborating evidence (medical report indicating lacerations, police findings), and discredited the defense's arguments regarding inconsistencies and improbabilities. The case underscores the principle that medical evidence is not always a requirement.
