## Legal Document Summary: People v. Bricero, G.R. No. 218428

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Segundo Bricero y Fernandez, G.R. No. 218428, November 7, 2018.

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the accused for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs).

**Holding:** Accused acquitted due to reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to prove compliance with Section 21 of RA 9165 regarding chain of custody. The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** Prescribes the procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, requiring immediate inventory and photographing in the presence of:
    *   The accused or his/her representative/counsel
    *   An elected public official
    *   A representative from the media
    *   A representative from the DOJ
    *   All must sign the inventory.

*   **Chain of Custody:** Crucial for establishing *corpus delicti*.  Refers to the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs from seizure to presentation in court.

**Liabilities & Penalties (if convicted):**

*   Life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 (originally imposed by RTC and affirmed by CA).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21, RA 9165:** The core issue. Buy-bust team's failure to follow the prescribed procedures casts doubt on the identity and integrity of the seized drug.
    *   No required witnesses (DOJ, media, elected official) were present during seizure and inventory.
    *   Inventory was not prepared by the apprehending officer/poseur-buyer.
    *   No photographs of the seized drug were taken at the place of seizure.
    *   No justification offered for the non-compliance.

*   **Defense of Frame-up:** The Court gives credence to the accused's defense of denial and frame-up.
    *   No coordination with PDEA.
    *   Lack of unbiased witnesses.

*   **Misapplication of Presumption of Regularity:** The Supreme Court notes that lapses in procedures are affirmative proofs of irregularity, outweighing the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.

*   **RTC's Reliance on Accused's Plea for Forgiveness:** The Supreme Court clarifies the RTC's reliance on this was misplaced, stemming from an extortion attempt by PO2 Ortiz, not an admission of guilt.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The primary statutory basis for the charge.
*   **People v. Opiana, 750 Phil. 140 (2015):** Elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Guzon, 719 Phil. 441 (2013):** Chain of custody definition and importance.
*   **People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018:**  Necessity of the presence of witnesses and justified absence requirement.
*   **People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890, April 18, 2018:** Explanation of DOJ, media and public official witnesses present.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Illustrates the adverse effects of tampering, contamination, or planting of evidence.
*   **People v. Alagarme, 754 Phil. 449 (2015):** Clarifies the IRR saving clause that excuses failures to follow the chain of custody requirements.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "saving clause" in Section 21 of the IRR of RA 9165, which allows for non-compliance with the prescribed procedures under justifiable grounds, is contentious. The prosecution failed to establish justifiable grounds in this case.
* The exact location and method of inventory of seized items.
* The lack of photographic evidence further complicates the case.

**Potential Strategies:**
* Any future case using similar evidence collected by this drug enforcement unit should be met with skepticism.
* Evidence should be collected from the unit's historical record to establish any past instances where the same drug enforement officers have performed similar illegal buy-bust operations.
