## Legal Document Summary: *Taguiam v. COMELEC & Tuddao* (G.R. No. 184801, July 30, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC Resolutions annulling Petitioner Taguiam's proclamation as the 12th winning candidate for Sangguniang Panglungsod of Tuguegarao City and directing the proclamation of Private Respondent Tuddao.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Disputed Election:** 2007 Local Elections in Tuguegarao City.
*   **Comelec Resolution (Dec. 20, 2007):** Granted Tuddao's petition for correction of manifest errors in Election Returns (ERs) and Statements of Votes by Precinct (SOVPs) and annulled Taguiam's proclamation. Directed CBOC to reconvene and proclaim the 12th winning candidate based on corrected SOVPs.
*   **Basis for COMELEC Decision:** Found discrepancies between SOVPs and ERs in specified precincts. Specifically, Tuddao's votes were understated, and Taguiam's votes were overstated, altering the election outcome. Net effect: Tuddao gained 9 votes, Taguiam lost 24 votes.
*   **Comelec En Banc Resolution (Oct. 9, 2008):** Denied Taguiam's Motion for Reconsideration.

**Petitioner's Arguments:**

*   COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion by taking cognizance of Tuddao's petition despite late filing (beyond the 5-day period under Rule 27, Section 5 of the 1993 COMELEC Rules of Procedure).
*   Tuddao's remedy should have been an election protest.

**COMELEC's Rationale (Affirmed by the Supreme Court):**

*   COMELEC has the power to suspend its rules to determine the true will of the electorate (Sec. 4, Rule 1, COMELEC Rules of Procedure; *Dela Llana v. COMELEC*, 462 Phil. 355, 372 (2003); *Jaramilla v. COMELEC*, 460 Phil. 507 (2003)).
*   Mathematical errors in the SOVPs constituted a flawed tabulation, rendering the initial proclamation invalid. *Torres v. COMELEC*, 337 Phil. 270 (1997) established that a proclamation, if null and void, is considered no proclamation at all.
*   Liberal construction of election rules is necessary to uphold the people's will (*Octava v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 166105, March 22, 2007, 518 SCRA 759, 765-766).

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   Affirmed COMELEC Resolutions.
*   No grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC. COMELEC acted pursuant to its constitutional mandate to determine the true will of the electorate.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **COMELEC's Discretionary Power:** The broad discretion granted to the COMELEC to suspend its rules creates uncertainty and could be subject to abuse. However, this discretion is justified to determine the real will of the electorate.
*   **"Manifest Error" Definition:** The definition of "manifest error" can be contentious and susceptible to varying interpretations.
*   **Relevance of Election Protest:** While the Court noted that an election protest is the appropriate remedy after a valid proclamation, this case highlights the exception where the proclamation is inherently flawed.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article IX-A, Section 6:** COMELEC's power to promulgate its own rules.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Sections 3 & 4 of Rule 1 (Construction and Suspension), Rule 27, Section 5 (Pre-proclamation Controversies).
*   ***Dela Llana v. COMELEC*, 462 Phil. 355, 372 (2003):** Affirms COMELEC's power to suspend rules.
*   ***Jaramilla v. COMELEC*, 460 Phil. 507 (2003):** Affirms COMELEC's power to suspend rules.
*   ***Octava v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 166105, March 22, 2007, 518 SCRA 759, 765-766:** Liberal construction of election rules.
*   ***Torres v. COMELEC*, 337 Phil. 270 (1997):** Annulment of Proclamation.

**Conclusion:** The case confirms COMELEC's authority to correct manifest errors even if petitions are filed late, prioritizing the accurate reflection of voters' intent. The ruling underscores the COMELEC's broad discretion in election matters and the limited role of technical procedural rules when the integrity of the election is at stake.
