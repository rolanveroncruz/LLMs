## Legal Document Summary: *Fleet Management Services Philippines, Inc. v. Alejandro G. Lescabo* (G.R. No. 268962)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that affirmed the NLRC's award of permanent and total disability benefits, sickness allowance, reimbursement for medical expenses, and attorney's fees to Respondent Lescabo, a seafarer.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC Incorporation:** The 2010 POEA-SEC is incorporated into the seafarer's employment contract, dictating terms of disability compensation.
*   **Employer's Obligation for Medical Assessment:** Employer (Fleet Ship) is obligated to provide a valid, final, and definite medical assessment of the seafarer's condition by a company-designated physician within 120/240 days of repatriation, in accordance with POEA-SEC provisions.
*   **Disability Compensation:**  If the company-designated physician fails to issue a valid assessment, the seafarer's temporary and total disability becomes permanent and total, entitling him to disability benefits (USD 60,000.00 in this case).
*   **Third-Doctor Referral Rule:**  The third-doctor-referral rule only applies if the company-designated physician issues a valid, final, and definite assessment.

**Liabilities and Award:**

*   Fleet Management Services Philippines, Inc., Fleet Ship Management, Inc., and Janette T. Tumbali are jointly and severally liable.
*   **Award:**  USD 60,000.00 for permanent and total disability, attorney's fees of USD 6,000.00 (10% of disability benefits). The award is converted to Philippine currency at the time of payment and earns 6% legal interest per annum from finality until full payment.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Company-Designated Physician's Assessment:** The core issue is the validity of the "fit to work" assessment issued by the company-designated physician.  The Supreme Court found it invalid due to incompleteness, lack of sufficient basis (assessment by a doctor who had limited interaction with the patient), belated transmission, and improper notification to the seafarer.
*   **Third-Doctor Referral Rule Non-Compliance:** The employer argued the seafarer failed to comply with the third-doctor referral rule. However, the Court ruled this is irrelevant as the company-designated physician failed to issue a valid assessment within the stipulated timeframe.
*   **Attorneys fees** were awarded as per article 2208 of the New Civil Code.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **POEA-SEC (2010):** Governs seafarer employment contracts and disability claims.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law.
*   **Bitco v. Crossworld Marine Services, Inc. (G.R. No. 239190):** Defines what constitutes a valid, final, and definite medical assessment.
*   **Hanseatic Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. Ballon (769 Phil. 567):** Reinforces the need for completeness in medical assessments.
*   **Avior Marine, Inc. v. Turreda (G.R. No. 250806):** Highlights the need for sufficient basis and lack of bias in the company-designated physician's assessment.
*   **Grossman v. North Sea Marine Services Corp. (G.R. No. 256495):** Emphasizes timely delivery of assessments and proper notification to seafarer.
*   **Gere v. Anglo-Eastern Crew Management Phils., Inc. (G.R. Nos. 226656 & 226713):** States that medical reports should be personally received by the seafarer.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The assessment issued by the Company designated physician was considered incomplete by the Court due to incomplete indication of the resolution of all of the seafarers aliments at the time.
*   The report was considered to lack basis due to the physician making the final determination not having personally seen or assessed the patient.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the Petition, upholding the CA's decision. This case reaffirms the employer's obligation to provide a timely, valid, and unbiased medical assessment of a seafarer's condition under the POEA-SEC. The failure to do so results in a presumption of permanent and total disability, entitling the seafarer to corresponding benefits. The strict scrutiny applied to the company-designated physician's assessment emphasizes the importance of completeness, demonstrable basis, and adherence to procedural requirements, specifically timely and proper notification to the seafarer.
