## Legal Document Summary: Cambe v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 178456

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC Resolution No. 8212, dismissing petitioner Cambe's appeal regarding the exclusion of Election Return No. 9601666 by the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBC) of Lasam, Cagayan, which led to the proclamation of Dominador Go as the 8th Sangguniang Bayan member.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution:** Mandates that election cases, including pre-proclamation controversies, be heard and decided *first* by a COMELEC Division. Motions for Reconsideration are then decided en banc.
*   **Section 20 of R.A. No. 7166:** Outlines the procedure for canvassing contested returns, including the obligation of the Board to suspend canvass after ruling on objections to provide an opportunity for appeal, and to refrain from proclaiming a winner without COMELEC authorization after an appeal is filed.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **COMELEC:** Acted without jurisdiction by hearing the case *en banc* in the first instance, violating the Constitution. Faces liability for actions exceeding its authority. Resolution 8212 declared void insofar as SPC Case No. 07-212 is concerned.
*   **MBC:** Improperly excluded Election Return No. 9601666 without following procedures outlined in Sections 235 and 236 of the Omnibus Election Code, violating Cambe's right to appeal and disenfranchising voters. Faces potential administrative sanctions for non-compliance.
*   **Go:** Faces potential ouster from his position as the 8th Sangguniang Bayan member due to the invalid proclamation. Proclamation declared void ab initio due to failure to suspend canvass and lack of COMELEC authorization.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7166, Sec. 20:** Specifies the procedure for canvassing and appealing contested election returns.
*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC), Secs. 235 & 236:** Detail the steps to be taken when election returns appear tampered with or falsified, including using other copies and, if necessary, ordering a recount.
*   **Jainal v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 174551:** Cited extensively regarding the invalidity of a proclamation made without adhering to the mandatory suspension and appeal procedures under R.A. No. 7166, and the COMELEC's authority to nullify such proclamations.
*   **Lee v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 157004:** Clarifies the restrictive doctrine on the examination of election returns, stating that it doesn't apply when there's a prima facie showing that the return is not genuine.
*   **Balindong v. COMELEC, G.R. Nos. 153991-92:** Reiterates the prescribed procedure for COMELEC to examine other copies of questioned returns, and if necessary order a recount.
*   **Municipal Board of Canvassers of Glan v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 150496** This case, along with Sarmiento v. COMELEC G.R. No. 105628 and Balindong case reinforces the doctrine that the COMELEC en banc cannot hear pre-proclamation controversies in the first instance.
*   **Espidol v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 164922:** Reinforces the fact that the MBC's actions constituted a deprivation of the right to appeal the ruling to the COMELEC.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The main contention revolves around the proper interpretation and application of the procedure for handling questionable election returns and the consequences of failing to comply with mandatory appeal processes.
*   The "statistical improbability" of Election Return No. 9601666, specifically the excess of votes for Vice-Mayor over registered voters, creates ambiguity regarding the return's authenticity and warrants further investigation under OEC Sections 235 and 236.
*   The question of whether the COMELEC's actions in Resolution 8212 constituted an improper exercise of quasi-judicial power, requiring prior Division-level review, is a central legal issue.

**Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court *GRANTS* the petition, *SETTING ASIDE* COMELEC Resolution No. 8212 (insofar as it concerns SPC Case No. 07-212). The COMELEC is ordered to raffle the case to a Division for resolution and the position of the 8th Sangguniang Bayan member is *DECLARED VACANT*.

**Potential Next Steps:**

The COMELEC Division must now examine Election Return No. 9601666 following the procedures outlined in Sections 235 and 236 of the OEC. This may involve examining other copies of the return, checking the integrity of the ballot box, and potentially ordering a recount, if the integrity of the ballots have been preserved. Depending on the outcome of the Division's review, a special election might be warranted if a recount is impossible.
