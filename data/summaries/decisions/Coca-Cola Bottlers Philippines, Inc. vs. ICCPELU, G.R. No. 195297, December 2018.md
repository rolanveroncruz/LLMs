## Legal Document Summary: Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. vs. Iloilo Coca-Cola Plant Employees Labor Union (G.R. No. 195297)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's reversal of the NCMB's decision regarding Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.'s (CCBPI) discontinuance of mandatory Saturday work and its obligation to pay employees for those Saturdays.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) Article 10, Section 1:** Defines the normal work week as five days (Monday to Friday) of eight hours each, *and* one day (Saturday) of four hours. However, Article 11, Section 1(c) grants management the *option* to schedule work on Saturdays based on operational necessity. Article 11, Section 2(c) details premium pay for Saturday work.
*   **Management Prerogative:** CCBPI argues the CBA gives it the prerogative to schedule or *not* schedule Saturday work based on "operational necessity."
*   **"No Work, No Pay":** CCBPI invokes this principle, stating employees should only be paid for work actually performed.

**Liabilities:**

*   The CA initially ordered CCBPI to:
    *   Comply with the CBA's normal work week (including Saturday work).
    *   Allow employees to render work on Saturdays.
    *   Pay corresponding wages for Saturdays not worked from July 2, 2005, until the finality of the CA's decision.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in CBA Language:** The central dispute revolves around interpreting the CBA, specifically whether Article 10 mandates Saturday work, or whether Article 11 grants CCBPI discretion to eliminate it entirely. The phrase "option to schedule work" is the primary point of contention.
*   **Diminution of Benefits (Article 100, Labor Code):**  The Union argues eliminating Saturday work is a prohibited diminution of benefits. This is particularly relevant because past practice allegedly created an implied term.
*   **"Operational Necessity":** The meaning and application of "operational necessity" could be a future source of conflict. What constitutes a valid operational necessity for eliminating Saturday work?
*   **"Required to work on Saturdays":** Redundancy, ambiguity may occur on the interpretation of this phrase.
*   **"Premium Pay":** The CBA stipulated workers be paid premium rate to work on Saturdays.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Article 100, Labor Code (Non-Diminution of Benefits):**  Key to the Union's argument. *Royal Plant Workers Union v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.-Cebu Plant* (709 Phil. 350 (2013)) clarified the application of this article, stating that a monetary benefit has to be withdrawn.
*   **Article 83, Labor Code (Normal Hours of Work)**
*   **Article 87, Labor Code (Overtime Work):** CCBPI incorrectly analogizes Saturday work to overtime work.
*   **Article 1374, Civil Code:** Provides for interpretation of contract.
*   ***Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. v. Eastern Telecoms Employees Union***(681 Phil. 519 (2012)): Distinguished, as CCBPI's CBA has no unqualified provision for the 50% premium pay.
*   ***Manila Jockey Club Employees Labor-Union-PTGWO v. Manila Jockey Club, Inc.*** (546 Phil. 531 (2007)) and ***San Miguel Corporation v. Layoc, Jr.*** (562 Phil. 670 (2007)): Cited by CCBPI to argue overtime is not a benefit, but distinguished by the court.

**Outcome and Implications:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *affirmed* the NCMB decision.  The Court held:

*   The CBA grants CCBPI the *option* to schedule (or not schedule) Saturday work based on operational necessity. The Court emphasized that "work" referred to the working days themselves, not the working hours.
*   Eliminating Saturday work was not a prohibited diminution of benefits, as the *premium pay* (not the work itself) would be considered the benefit. CCBPI had not withdrawn premium pay for *scheduled* Saturday work, only ceased scheduling the work in the first place.
*   The "no work, no pay" principle applies, as employees were not illegally prevented from working.

This case clarifies that management prerogatives can be upheld when CBA language is clear and unambiguous, even if it results in a change to previously existing work arrangements. It reinforces the principle that benefits must be measured monetarily.
