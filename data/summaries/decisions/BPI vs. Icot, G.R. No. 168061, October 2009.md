## Legal Document Summary: BPI vs. Icot et al. (G.R. No. 168061)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision reversing the RTC's grant of a Writ of Possession in favor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI).

**Key Provisions:**
*   **Mortgage and Foreclosure:** Spouses Velasco obtained a loan from BPI in 1976, secured by a real estate mortgage. Failure to pay led to foreclosure and BPI becoming the highest bidder at the auction.
*   **Third-Party Claimants (Icots):** Respondents (Icots) claim ownership of the subject property based on an extrajudicial settlement from 1964, predating the mortgage. They initiated actions for quieting of title against Velasco.
*   **Compromise Agreement in Quieting of Title Cases:** In the quieting of title cases, Velasco acknowledged the Icots' ownership, leading to a Compromise Agreement and a court judgment based on the compromise. Velasco agreed to repurchase the property from BPI to clear the Icots' title.
*   **Contract to Sell with Velasco (Failed):** BPI and Velasco entered into a Contract to Sell in 1988, which was later cancelled due to Velasco's failure to pay.
*   **Petition for Writ of Possession:** BPI filed a petition for a Writ of Possession in 1999, which the RTC initially granted, but was later reversed by the CA.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**
*   **BPI:** As purchaser in the foreclosure sale, BPI typically would be entitled to a writ of possession after the redemption period. However, the Icots' adverse claim significantly complicates this.
*   **Icots:** Obligated to prove their claim of ownership superior to Velasco's mortgage. The Compromise Agreement with Velasco appears to support this claim.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Third Party Possession:** The key issue is the Icots' adverse possession and claim of ownership predating the mortgage.  Section 33, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court dictates possession is given to the purchaser unless a third party is holding adversely to the judgment obligor.
*   **Binding Effect of Compromise Agreement:** Does the Compromise Agreement between Velasco and the Icots bind BPI? The SC ruled that the mere mention of the mortgage in the Compromise Agreement does not make the Icots parties to the contract.
*   **Nature of Possession:** BPI bears the risk of having to initiate a separate judicial action (ejectment or reinvindicatory) to recover possession from the Icots.
*   **Act 3135 & Due Process:** The court noted that using an *ex parte* writ of possession to remove a third party in possession with a superior claim would violate due process.

**Relevant Case Law:**
*   **DBP v. Prime Neighborhood Association (G.R. Nos. 175728 and 178914, 8 May 2009):**  Obligation to issue writ of possession ceases to be ministerial when a third party claims adverse rights. True owner must resort to judicial process to recover property.
*   **Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals (424 Phil. 757 (2002)):** Reiterates the principle from DBP v. Prime Neighborhood Association.
*   **Tan Soo Huat v. Ongwico (63 Phil. 746, 749 (1936)):** Affirmed the right of possession by a purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure against the judgment debtor and his successor-in-interest, but not against persons whose right of possession is adverse to the latter.

**Statutory References:**
*   **Act 3135 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law):** Section 7 addresses the issuance of a writ of possession.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 33:** Defines the conditions for giving possession after the redemption period, specifically addressing third-party adverse claims.
*   **Civil Code, Article 433:** Actual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership; requiring a judicial process for recovery.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied BPI's petition, affirming the CA's decision. The Court held that BPI is not entitled to a writ of possession against the Icots, who possess the property under a claim of ownership adverse to the mortgagor, Velasco. BPI's remedy is to file a separate judicial action (ejectment or reinvindicatory action) to establish its superior right to possession. The Icots are protected by the legal presumption of just title stemming from their adverse possession.
