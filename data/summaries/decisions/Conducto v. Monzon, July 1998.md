**Case:** *Jesus S. Conducto vs. Judge Iluminado C. Monzon*, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1147 (2 July 1998)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case against Judge Monzon for ignorance of the law stemming from his denial of a motion to suspend a barangay chairman (Maghirang) facing criminal charges of unlawful appointment under Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code. Maghirang was accused of appointing his sister-in-law to a barangay position. The City Prosecutor sought his suspension pursuant to Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) after a criminal information was filed. Judge Monzon denied the suspension based on the principle that re-election condones prior misconduct, citing *Lizares vs. Hechanova* and *Aguinaldo vs. Santos*.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 13 of RA 3019:**  Mandates suspension of public officers facing criminal prosecution under RA 3019, Title 7, Book II of the RPC, or offenses involving fraud against the government.
*   **Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code**: Unlawful appointment.
*   **Re-election as Condonation:** The judge relied on the doctrine that re-election absolves an official of administrative liability for prior misconduct.
*   **Administrative vs. Criminal Liability:** The Supreme Court held that the re-election doctrine only applies to administrative cases, not criminal prosecutions.
*   **Ignorance of Law:** The central issue is whether Judge Monzon's denial of the suspension motion constitutes gross ignorance of the law, given established jurisprudence (*Ingco v. Sanchez*, *Luciano v. Provincial Governor*, *Oliveros v. Villaluz*) distinguishing between administrative and criminal liability in the context of re-election.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Judges have an obligation to be conversant with basic legal principles and aware of well-settled and authoritative doctrines. Failure to comprehend and apply clear precedents constitutes negligence.
*   Judge Monzon was found liable for incompetence due to ignorance of established legal doctrine or a deliberate disregard of the doctrine.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Erosion of Public Trust:**  Incorrect application of law by a judge undermines public confidence in the judiciary.
*   **Disciplinary Action:** Judges who demonstrate ignorance of the law or disregard established precedents face administrative sanctions.
*   **Erroneous rulings:** Failure to follow clear legal rules can lead to incorrect legal rulings.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document does not seem to have ambiguous/contentious clauses but revolves around whether the cited doctrine of re-election can be applied to a *criminal* case.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court found Judge Monzon liable for incompetence and fined him P5,000.00 with a warning.
