## Legal Document Summary: *Sto. Domingo-David vs. Guerrero and PNCC, G.R. No. 120965*

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 to annul a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order dismissing a complaint for annulment of title, recovery of possession, and damages.

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of the initial case (TG-1428) for failure to comply with Administrative Circular No. 04-94 (now Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure) is a dismissal with prejudice, barring the refiling of the complaint as Case TG-1440, based on *res judicata*.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, setting aside the RTC's order and reinstating the complaint. The SC held that the dismissal of TG-1428 was *without prejudice*, and therefore does not bar refiling of the same cause of action.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Administrative Circular 04-94 (now Section 5, Rule 7, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure):** Requires a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping in initiatory pleadings. Failure to comply results in dismissal *without prejudice*, unless otherwise provided.
*   **Section 3, Rule 17 (Rules of Court/Rules of Civil Procedure):** Deals with dismissal for failure to prosecute; dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits *unless otherwise provided*. The court emphasized that this section is most pertinent to the resolution of the case.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PNCC's Risk:** Facing renewed litigation on the underlying claims for annulment of title, recovery of possession and damages.  The PNCC will have to defend on the merits.
*   **Original dismissal based on a technicality:** The trial court's ruling initially supported the notion that a technical dismissal can have the same effect as one on the merits, citing *General Offset Press, Inc. vs. Anatalio*, a proposition refuted in the present ruling.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Circular No. 04-94 (Incorporated in Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure):** Governs the requirement for a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping.
*   **Rule 17, Section 3 (Rules of Court/Rules of Civil Procedure):** Deals with dismissal for failure to prosecute an action, including failure to comply with rules or court orders.
*   ***General Offset Press, Inc. vs. Anatalio, July 26, 1966, 17 SCRA 688, 691:* Cited by respondent judge but overturned by the present ruling.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Unless otherwise provided":** The SC emphasizes that if the RTC intended the dismissal to be *with prejudice*, it should have explicitly stated so in the dispositive portion of the dismissal order. The absence of this specific statement means the dismissal is presumed to be *without prejudice*.

**Legal Analysis for the Lawyer:**

This case reinforces the principle that dismissals for technical reasons, such as failure to comply with procedural rules like Administrative Circular 04-94, are generally *without prejudice* unless the court explicitly states otherwise. The emphasis on the dispositive portion of the order is crucial.  The ruling clarified that absent an express declaration, the dismissal cannot be construed as an adjudication on the merits for *res judicata* purposes. Furthermore, it clarifies that a motion for reconsideration may be dispensed with when the issue involved is purely one of law, and thus, the petition was not premature. The main takeaway for legal practitioners is the need for explicit language in court orders regarding the nature of dismissals to avoid future ambiguity and potential appeals. The case is instructive for future instances that involve refiling of similar causes of action.
