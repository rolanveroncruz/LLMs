## Legal Document Summary: *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Josefina R. Dumlao, et al.* (G.R. No. 167809)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a case involving the determination of just compensation for agricultural lands acquired under Operation Land Transfer (OLT) pursuant to Presidential Decree (PD) No. 27 and Republic Act (RA) No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law).

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Governing Law for Just Compensation:** RA No. 6657, not PD No. 27 or Executive Order (EO) No. 228, applies to the determination of just compensation because the process was incomplete when RA No. 6657 was enacted. PD No. 27 and EO No. 228 have only suppletory effect.
*   **Date of Taking:** The date of taking is the date of issuance of the Emancipation Patents (EPs) to farmer-beneficiaries, not the date of effectivity of PD No. 27 (October 21, 1972). *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo* (G.R. No. 168533)
*   **Valuation Methodology:** Rejects the Court of Appeals (CA)'s reliance solely on the Commissioner's Report's market value. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) must determine just compensation based on Section 17 of RA No. 6657, incorporating factors like cost of acquisition, current value, nature, actual use, and income. This should be done by the implementing regulations, Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Administrative Order (AO) No. 6, Series of 1992, as amended by AO No. 11, Series of 1994, including the prescribed formulas.
*   **Right of Retention:** Landowners (respondents) are entitled to their retention rights under RA No. 6657.
*   **Payment for All Properties:** Respondents are entitled to just compensation even for properties not yet fully processed by the DAR. The court's determination of just compensation is not dependent on prior DAR valuation. The principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not strictly applicable given the unreasonable delays.
*   **Remand:** Case remanded to the RTC for a determination of just compensation in accordance with RA No. 6657 and applicable DAR AOs.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP):** Obligated to pay just compensation as determined by the RTC in accordance with RA No. 6657. Liable for interest from the date of taking until fully paid.
*   **Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR):** DAR valuation is preliminary. Liable for delay in settling the just compensation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Disputes:** Potential for further disputes regarding the application of the formula in DAR AO No. 6-92, as amended, and the determination of the various factors (CNI, CS, MV). Proving Cost of Operations may be difficult.
*   **Undetermined Date of Taking:** The RTC needs to determine the exact dates of issuance of the Emancipation Patents to determine the date of taking.
*   **Incomplete Evidence:** The Supreme Court notes that there is incomplete evidence, which is the cause for remanding the case.
