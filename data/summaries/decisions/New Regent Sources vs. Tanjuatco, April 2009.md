Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *New Regent Sources, Inc. vs. Teofilo Victor Tanjuatco, Jr., and Vicente Cuevas* G.R. No. 168800, April 16, 2009

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of RTC Orders granting Demurrer to Evidence filed by Tanjuatco and denying NRSI's Motion for Reconsideration.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   NRSI (Petitioner) sued Tanjuatco and Cuevas (Respondents) for rescission/declaration of nullity of contract, reconveyance, and damages, claiming Cuevas, its Chairman and President, fraudulently acquired land intended for NRSI and subsequently assigned his rights to Tanjuatco.
*   Cuevas was declared in default.
*   Tanjuatco asserted he was a *bona fide* purchaser for value.
*   The RTC granted Tanjuatco's demurrer to evidence, finding insufficiencies in NRSI's allegations and evidence. The RTC also held Tanjuatco to be an innocent purchaser for value.
*   NRSI claims right to land based on right of accretion under Article 457 of Civil Code.
*   The land was part of the Dried San Juan River Bed, which falls under public dominion pursuant to Article 502(1) of the Civil Code.
*  Tanjuatco derived his title from OCT No. 245 registered in the name of Republic of the Philippines.
*   NRSI argues that RTC erred in relying on Order from Director of Lands that was not formally offered in evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   NRSI had the burden to prove its ownership or dominical right, fraudulent registration by Tanjuatco, and that Tanjuatco was not a *bona fide* purchaser.
*   NRSI was required to provide evidence to prove that it had met all the conditions provided by law under Article 457.
*   NRSI failed to substantiate its claim of entitlement to ownership of the lands in Tanjuatco's name.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Question of Fact vs. Question of Law:** The Supreme Court characterized NRSI's arguments as primarily raising questions of fact, which are not reviewable under Rule 45 on Certiorari. This limited the scope of review.
*   **Sufficiency of Evidence for Reconveyance:**  The court found NRSI's evidence insufficient to meet the requisites for reconveyance, specifically concerning proving a claim of ownership and showing fraud in the registration by Tanjuatco.
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value:** The court explicitly sided with Tanjuatco who relied on the correctness of the certificate of title issued by the Republic of the Philippines.
*   **Formally offered evidence:** Even though the Director of Lands was not formally offered into evidence, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of Tanjuatco's claim.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals to the Supreme Court on questions of law.
*   **Article 457, Civil Code:** Defines accretion. *Meneses v. Court of Appeals* (cited) provides interpretation of requisites.
*   **Article 502(1), Civil Code:** Defines property of public dominion.
*   **Walstrom v. Mapa, Jr.:**  Defines actions for reconveyance.
*   **Dela Cruz v. Dela Cruz:** Defines innocent purchaser for value.
*   **Section 34, Rule 132, Rules of Court** The court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally offered.
*   **Section 1, Rule 129, Rules of Court** Judicial notice.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC's dismissal of the complaint. NRSI failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims for ownership based on accretion or fraud, and the court found Tanjuatco to be a *bona fide* purchaser. The lack of formal offering of the Director of Lands order was not material as Tanjuatco's reliance on the title derived from the Republic of the Philippines was deemed sufficient.
