## Legal Document Summary: Llorente, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan & Fuertes, G.R. No. 122166

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review of a Sandiganbayan decision finding Petitioner Llorente (municipal mayor) guilty of violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for allegedly causing undue injury to Private Respondent Fuertes (Assistant Municipal Treasurer) by refusing to sign payrolls and vouchers.  The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, acquitting Llorente.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 3(e) of RA 3019:**  Prohibits causing undue injury to any party through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence. Requires proof *beyond reasonable doubt* of undue injury to the offended party.
*   **Local Government Code (LGC):** Cited provisions relating to the preparation of budgets by the local chief executive (Sec. 318), effectivity of budgets (Sec. 320), and duties of the municipal mayor to prepare and submit budgets (Sec. 444). Also cited Sections 344 and 346 requiring certification of fund availability and adherence to appropriation ordinances for disbursements.
*   **Compromise Agreement:** Petitioner (as respondent in SP No. 45) entered into a compromise agreement to sign Fuertes's vouchers, later subject to execution.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks (for Petitioner - now mitigated by acquittal):**

*   **Initial Sandiganbayan Ruling:**  Found Llorente guilty, sentencing him to imprisonment, perpetual disqualification from public office, and payment of costs. The Sandiganbayan interpreted the delay in payment as unreasonable, causing undue injury, and constituting evident bad faith.
*   **Potential Liability Under Sec. 3(f) of RA 3019:**  The Supreme Court noted that Llorente's actions might fall under Sec. 3(f) (neglecting or refusing to act on a pending matter without justification), but he was not charged with this.

**Key Legal Arguments and Supreme Court Rationale:**

*   **Undue Injury:** The Supreme Court emphasized that "undue injury" under Sec. 3(e) requires *proof of actual damage*, not merely speculative or incidental injury (citing *Alejandro vs. People* and *Jacinto vs. Sandiganbayan*). Because Fuertes was ultimately paid all her claims, the element of undue injury was *not* established beyond reasonable doubt. Vague claims of financial hardship were insufficient without specific details and evidence.
*   **Evident Bad Faith:** The Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution *failed* to prove evident bad faith. Llorente had justifiable reasons for delaying the payments, specifically:
    *   **Fuertes's Failure to Submit Clearances:**  Fuertes, as Assistant Municipal Treasurer, should have known the requirement to submit money and property clearances (required under Article 443 of the LGC's Implementing Rules and Regulations). Her failure to do so contributed to the delay.
    *   **Lack of Appropriation Ordinance/Certification:** Llorente had a duty *not* to sign vouchers without a corresponding appropriation ordinance and certification of fund availability as required by Sec. 344 of the LGC.
    *   The Court referenced *Marcelo vs. Sandiganbayan*, defining bad faith as dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, and conscious wrongdoing. *Jacinto vs. Sandiganbayan* and *Alejandro vs. Sandiganbayan* were cited to demonstrate instances where evident bad faith was absent due to reasonable justifications.
*   **Interpretation of "Causing":** The Supreme Court clarified that "causing" undue injury is not limited to positive acts but includes inaction or delay. However, even if Llorente's delay was a cause, it did *not* result in the "undue injury" required under Sec. 3(e).
*   **Sec. 3(f) vs. Sec. 3(e):** The Court distinguished between Sec. 3(e) and Sec. 3(f), noting that while Llorente's actions might have been a neglect or refusal to act, the Information charged him under Sec. 3(e), focusing on undue injury.  Convicting him under Sec. 3(f) without being charged would violate his due process rights.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 3019, Section 3(e):**  Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the primary law in question.
*   **RA 3019, Section 3(f):** Referenced but not charged.
*   **Local Government Code (RA 7160), Sections 318, 320, 444, 344, and 346:** Used to define the Mayor's duties regarding budgeting and fund disbursement.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2199:** Definition of actual or compensatory damages.
*   **Alejandro vs. People, 170 SCRA 400:**  Defines undue injury and establishes the need for proof of actual damage.
*   **Jacinto vs. Sandiganbayan, 178 SCRA 254:**  Reinforces the need for proving actual damage for undue injury, examines actions of bad faith.
*   **Ponce de Leon vs. Sandiganbayan, 186 SCRA 745; Pecho vs. Sandiganbayan, 238 SCRA 116; Medija, Jr. vs. Sandiganbayan, 218 SCRA 219:** Cited for elements of Sec. 3(e) violation.
*   **Marcelo vs. Sandiganbayan, 185 SCRA 346:** Defines bad faith.
*   **Coronado vs. Sandiganbayan, 225 SCRA 406; Nessia vs. Fermin, 220 SCRA 615:** Cited for elements of Sec. 3(f) violation.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Definition of "Undue Injury":**  The case hinges on the precise meaning of "undue injury."  The Supreme Court clarified that it requires proof of actual damage and cannot be presumed. The lack of specific, quantifiable damages was critical to the acquittal.
*   **Good Faith vs. Bad Faith:** Determining the subjective intent of the mayor was a key issue.  The Supreme Court found that there were reasonable justifications for his actions, negating a finding of evident bad faith.
*   **Procedural Issue:** The prosecution's decision to charge under Sec. 3(e) rather than Sec. 3(f) proved fatal to their case, as the Court was unwilling to convict under a different section without proper charging and due process.
