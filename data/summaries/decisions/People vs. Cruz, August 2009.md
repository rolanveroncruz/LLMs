**Case Summary: *People v. Cruz*, G.R. No. 186129 (2009)**

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming an RTC conviction for statutory rape under Art. 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, specifically paragraph 1(a) (Rape by means of force and intimidation) in relation to RA 7610.  The victim was 9 years old at the time of the incident.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Elements of Statutory Rape:** The Court reiterated that the essential elements are (1) carnal knowledge and (2) the victim being under 12 years of age. These were established. *People v. Marcos, G.R. No. 185380, June 18, 2009*.
*   **Victim's Testimony:** The Court emphasized that a conviction can rest solely on the credible testimony of the victim, especially in rape cases. *People v. Lagarde, G.R. No. 182549, January 20, 2009*. The victim's testimony was found credible.
*   **Hymenal Laceration:** The Court held that proof of hymenal laceration is not an essential element of rape. *People v. Jumawid, G.R. No. 184756, June 5, 2009*.  Lack of conclusive proof of sexual intercourse not fatal to prosecution.
*   **Impotence as a Defense:**  The defense of impotence requires expert medical testimony and must be proven with certainty to overcome the presumption of potency. *People v. Alcartado, G.R. Nos. 132379-82, June 29, 2000*. The Court found the evidence of the accused's erectile dysfunction, diagnosed three years after the incident, insufficient to establish impotence at the time of the rape.
*   **Alibi:** To be credible, an alibi must establish the physical impossibility of the accused being at the scene of the crime. *People v. Mahinay, G.R. No. 179190, January 20, 2009*. The alibi was deemed insufficient as the accused could have easily traveled from his claimed location to the crime scene.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Accused found guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the crime of statutory rape.
*   Sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (life imprisonment) and accessory penalties.
*   Liable for civil indemnity (P50,000), moral damages (P50,000), and exemplary damages (increased from P25,000 to P30,000).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense of impotence is often difficult to prove and relies heavily on medical evidence and timing.
*   Alibi defenses are inherently weak unless they demonstrate absolute physical impossibility of presence at the crime scene.
*   The ruling emphasizes the weight given to the victim's testimony in rape cases; however, this also necessitates thorough scrutiny of that testimony.
*   R.A. No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) and R.A. No. 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act) provide additional protections to the victim.
