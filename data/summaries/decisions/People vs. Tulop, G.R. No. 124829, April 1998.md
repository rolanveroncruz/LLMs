Here's a legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Gregorio Tulop @ “Boy Tulop,” et al.* (G.R. No. 124829, April 21, 1998)

**Court:** Supreme Court, First Division

**Ponente:** Panganiban, J.

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Gregorio Tulop and Salvador Baldeviano of murder and sentencing them to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder of Sesenando Sandoval on July 5, 1992, in Orion, Bataan. Six individuals were initially charged, but only Tulop and Baldeviano were tried.
*   **Prosecution's Evidence:** Rowena Sandoval, the victim's daughter, testified as the lone eyewitness, stating that she saw Tulop and Baldeviano, along with others, attack and kill her father with bladed weapons ("panlabra" and "balisong"). Dr. Nicudemos Corpuz testified to the multiple hack wounds, including one to the face and stomach, causing cardio-respiratory arrest.
*   **Defense's Evidence (Tulop):** Alibi. Tulop claimed he was in Camp Aguinaldo with Zaldy Dizon from July 3-7, 1992, seeking reinstatement to military service. M/Sgt. Novero corroborated this, stating Tulop was helping in his canteen. Zaldy Dizon corroborated he was processing his papers and helping with the canteen.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Convicted Tulop and Baldeviano of murder based on the credibility of Rowena Sandoval's testimony.
*   **Appellant's Arguments:** (1) RTC erred in crediting the lone testimony of the complainant. (2) RTC erred in convicting the accused.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Affirmed** the RTC decision with clarification and addition.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Upheld the RTC's assessment of Rowena Sandoval's testimony as credible, positive, and straightforward. Emphasized deference to trial courts in witness credibility assessments. Rejected the argument that familial relationship *ipso facto* discredits a witness. Addressed the delay in reporting due to fear of retaliation. Cited case law supporting conviction based on the testimony of a single credible witness (e.g., *People v. Dela Cruz*, 207 SCRA 632).
*   **Alibi:** Rejected Tulop's alibi as inherently weak and unreliable, emphasizing the lack of physical impossibility for Tulop to be at the crime scene. Dismissed the corroborating testimony of M/Sgt. Novero as lacking personal knowledge and improbable.
*   **Crime Committed:** Affirmed the finding of murder qualified by treachery. The attack on an unarmed victim by multiple assailants with deadly weapons constituted treachery (Art. 14, No. 16, Revised Penal Code; *People v. Talingting*, G.R. No. 107747). The prosecution failed to prove evident premeditation or use of nighttime.
*   **Civil Liability:** Added an order for Tulop to pay P50,000 in civil indemnity to the victim's heirs. (*People vs. Caballes*, G.R. Nos. 1102723-24).
*   **Form of Judgment:** Criticized the RTC's failure to specify the offense, degree of participation, and civil liability in the judgment's dispositive portion, emphasizing the need for clarity and completeness under Rule 120 of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lone Witness Testimony:** While legally sufficient, the case hinged solely on the testimony of a single witness. Defense counsel could have more aggressively challenged the perception and memory of the sole witness. The court addressed concerns about the reliability of Rowena's testimony by explaining that she was the only one who witnessed the crime.
*   **Alibi Weakness:** Tulop's alibi was weak and easily discredited.
*   **Sentencing and Dispositive Portion:** The Supreme Court noted the RTC's error in the dispositive portion of the judgment, highlighting the importance of precise legal language in court decisions.
