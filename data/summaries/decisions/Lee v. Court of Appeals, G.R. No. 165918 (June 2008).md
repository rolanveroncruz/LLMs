## Legal Document Summary: *Quintin Lee, Jr. vs. Hon. Court of Appeals, People of the Philippines and Amado Villafania* (G.R. No. 165918, June 17, 2008)

This case involves a petition for certiorari filed by Quintin Lee, Jr. (Petitioner) against the Court of Appeals (CA), People of the Philippines, and Amado Villafania, challenging the CA's dismissal of his appeal in a reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and damage to property case.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Offense:** Petitioner was convicted by the MTCC of Dagupan City for reckless imprudence resulting in the death of Amado Villafania and damage to property (Nissan Bluebird).
*   **MTCC Judgment:** Convicted Petitioner, sentenced to 4 months and 1 day to 2 years, 7 months and 10 days imprisonment and to pay damages.
*   **RTC Appeal:** RTC affirmed MTCC decision.
*   **CA Proceedings:** Petitioner initially filed a petition for review before the CA. The CA first dismissed for non-compliance with Rule 42, Section 2(d) but later reinstated the petition. The CA then dismissed the appeal, holding Petitioner pursued the wrong mode of appeal.
*   **Disputed Mode of Appeal:** The core issue is whether the CA correctly dismissed the appeal for being a petition for *certiorari* (Rule 65) when it should have been a petition for *review* (Rule 42).

**Holding & Reasoning:**

The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately **dismissed** the Petitioner's *certiorari* petition, affirming the CA's dismissal, **although on different grounds**.

*   The SC found that the Petitioner's appeal to the CA was indeed intended as a Petition for Review under Rule 42, not a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.
*   However, the SC upheld the CA's dismissal (although they should have decided the merits), as Petitioner had failed to comply with the formal requirements of Rule 42, Section 2(d) (failure to submit certified copies and material portions of the record).
*   SC also noted that the petitioner erred in invoking the wrong remedy before the Supreme Court. He should have filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 instead of a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 365 & 249:** Defines and penalizes reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 42:** governs appeals from RTC decisions in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to the CA.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** governs special civil actions for certiorari to correct jurisdictional errors or grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** governs appeals from Court of Appeals decisions to the Supreme Court.
*   **Zafra v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 139013, September 17, 2002, 389 SCRA 200, 206-207.** (Caption vs. Allegations)
*   **Empire Insurance Company v. NLRC, G.R. No. 121879, August 14, 1998, 294 SCRA 263, 269.** (Certiorari as limited review).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Misinterpretation of Pleading:** The key risk stemmed from the petitioner's apparent mislabeling or unclear designation of his CA pleading. Including allegations typical of certiorari claims within a Rule 42 Petition for Review created confusion.
*   **Strict Compliance with Procedural Rules:** The case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly those regarding documentation and filing requirements. Failure to comply can result in dismissal, even if there might be merit in the underlying claim.
*   **Choosing the Correct Remedy:** Choosing the correct remedy is critical, as errors in this regard can be fatal to the case.

**Obligations:**

*   The petitioner had the obligation to file the appropriate appeal, following the required format and content in the correct court.
*   Petitioner needed to follow the documentation requirements as laid out in Rule 42, Section 2(d).

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioner is liable to pay death indemnity and moral damages to the heirs of the victim.
*   Petitioner is subject to imprisonment for the stated term.
