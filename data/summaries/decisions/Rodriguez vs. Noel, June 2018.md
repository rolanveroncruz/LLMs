**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-18-2525 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 15-4435-RTJ)**

**Case:** Samuel N. Rodriguez v. Hon. Oscar P. Noel, Jr.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** June 25, 2018

**Nature of Complaint:** Administrative complaint against Judge Oscar P. Noel, Jr. for violation of the Rules of Court and the Code of Judicial Conduct, Gross Ignorance of the Law, Grave Abuse of Discretion, and Bias and Partiality, stemming from actions taken in Misc. Case No. 3957 (bail determination) and Civil Case No. 8588 (TRO).

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Temporary Release Order (Misc. Case No. 3957):**
    *   **Complainant's Argument:** Judge issued a Temporary Release Order for Basalo *before* the formal filing of the petition for bail with the OCC.
    *   **Judge's Defense:** Accused were arrested on June 26, 2015. On a Sunday, June 28, 2015, defense counsel approached Judge with a bail petition, to which the City Prosecutor promptly commented. Bail was posted, leading to the release order. Official filing occurred the next business day (June 29, 2015) due to the weekend.
    *   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) found no wrongdoing, citing that while formal filing occurred later, the application for bail and Prosecutor's Comment were considered by the judge prior to issuing the order. The SC notes the accused had a right to bail for the frustrated murder charge, according to Section 4, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, and Article III, Section 13 of the Constitution.  The judge may act on bailable offenses conformably with Section 17, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, as amended.
    *   **Case Law:**  The SC cited Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 2-99, which allows judges to act on bailable offenses on weekends.

2.  **Temporary Restraining Order (Civil Case No. 8588):**
    *   **Complainant's Argument:** The 72-hour TRO was improperly extended beyond the permissible period.
    *   **Judge's Defense:** TRO issued on July 10, 2015 (Friday). Due to weekend constraints and a prior commitment to the Enhanced Justice on Wheels (EJOW) program in a remote province, the summary hearing for extension was delayed.
    *   **Ruling:** The SC agreed with the OCA that the judge erred.  The original 72-hour TRO expired on July 13, 2015.  Extending it on July 14, 2015, effectively revived an expired TRO, exceeding the maximum 20-day period allowed under Section 5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.
    *   **Statutory Reference:** Section 5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.
    *   **Case Law:** Cites *Guillermo v. Reyes, Jr.*, 310 Phil. 176, 185 (1995); OCA v. Vestil, 561 Phil. 142 (2007), citing De Leon v. Corpuz, 506 Phil. 604, 612 (2005); Mondejar v. Buban, 413 Phil. 428 (2001); OCA v. Mendoza, 394 Phil. 603 (2000)

**Liabilities/Penalties:**

*   Initially charged with violation of the Rules of Court and the Code of Judicial Conduct, Gross Ignorance of the Law, Grave Abuse of Discretion, and Bias and Partiality
*   Found guilty of Gross Ignorance of the Law for the improper extension of the TRO.
*   **Penalty:** Reprimand with a stern warning. Mitigation considered due to the judge's 16 years of service and the constraints of the EJOW program.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules regarding TROs. Any deviation, even with seemingly valid justifications (e.g., prior commitments), can lead to administrative liability.
*   The decision clarifies that while judges have some leeway, they must exercise due care. Incompetence or deliberate bad faith in neglecting basic legal principles is not tolerated.
*   The lenient penalty suggests that mitigating circumstances can significantly influence the outcome of administrative proceedings.
