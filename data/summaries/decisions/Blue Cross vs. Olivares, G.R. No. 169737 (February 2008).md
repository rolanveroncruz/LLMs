**Case Summary: Blue Cross Health Care, Inc. vs. Neomi and Danilo Olivares, G.R. No. 169737 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari involving a health care agreement and denial of coverage.

**Facts:** Respondent Neomi Olivares enrolled in Petitioner Blue Cross' health care program.  Shortly after the effective date (38 days), she suffered a stroke and incurred medical expenses. Blue Cross refused to issue a letter of authorization pending submission of a certification from her physician that the stroke wasn't due to a pre-existing condition.  Respondents settled the bill and sued for collection.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Pre-Existing Condition Exclusion:** The agreement excluded ailments due to pre-existing conditions that manifest within one year of effectivity, defining it as a disability that existed before the membership date whose natural history can be clinically determined. The definition explicitly includes conditions like hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
*   **Patient-Physician Confidentiality:** Respondent invoked this to prevent her doctor from releasing medical information.

**Judicial History:**

*   **MeTC:** Dismissed the complaint, finding that Neomi preventing her doctor from issuing the required certification was grounds for suspending payment.
*   **RTC:** Reversed, ordering Blue Cross to pay medical bills, consultation fees, and damages.  Held that the burden was on Blue Cross to prove the pre-existing condition exclusion, which it failed to do.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Issues:**

1.  Did Blue Cross prove Neomi's stroke was caused by a pre-existing condition?
2.  Is Blue Cross liable for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees?

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Burden of Proof:**  The Court held that Blue Cross had the burden to prove the pre-existing condition. Cites *Philamcare Health Systems, Inc. v. CA* which categorizes health care agreements as non-life insurance, thus subject to rules of contra proferentem - ambiguity construed against the insurer.
*   **Suppressed Evidence:** The presumption that suppressed evidence would be adverse (Rule 131, Sec. 3(e), Rules of Court) does not apply because the evidence (doctor's report) was privileged communication.
*   **Bad Faith:** The Court upheld the finding of bad faith based on the lower courts' assessment that Blue Cross denied the claim merely on its perception that stroke is a pre-existing condition and that Olivares was forced to pay for treatment while suffering the effects of a stroke.

**Liabilities:**

*   Payment of the medical bill and consultation fees, plus legal interest from the filing of the complaint.
*   Moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.
*   Treble costs.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Pre-Existing Condition":** The breadth of the definition allows Blue Cross significant latitude to deny coverage based on conditions that may or may not be causally linked to the presented claim. Listing of conditions (like hypertension) could lead to denials even if they are remote causes or non-related.
*   **Doctor-Patient Privilege vs. Insurer's Due Diligence:**  The Court emphasized that Blue Cross should have made its own assessment, rather than passively waiting for the doctor's report.  This places a higher burden on the insurer.
*   **Good Faith vs. Bad Faith:** The finding of bad faith and the award of damages rest heavily on the factual findings of the lower courts and may turn on the specific circumstances. The court focused on the financial burden on the respondent while she was still sick.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Philamcare Health Systems, Inc. v. CA* (2002): Health care agreement is a non-life insurance. Contra proferentem rule applies.
*   Rule 131, Sec. 3(e), Rules of Court: Disputable presumption regarding suppressed evidence.

**Legal Precision Points:**

*   The Court strictly construes limitations on liability in insurance contracts against the insurer.
*   The burden of proving an exception to liability lies with the insurer.
*   The assertion of a privilege, like doctor-patient confidentiality, can prevent the application of adverse presumption for non-presentation of evidence.
