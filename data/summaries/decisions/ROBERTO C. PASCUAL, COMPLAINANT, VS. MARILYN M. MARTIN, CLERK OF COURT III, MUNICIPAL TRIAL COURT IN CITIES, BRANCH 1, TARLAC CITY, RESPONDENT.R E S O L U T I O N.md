**Case Summary: *Roberto C. Pascual v. Marilyn M. Martin* (A.M. No. P-08-2552)**

**Nature of Case:** Administrative complaint against Marilyn M. Martin, Clerk of Court III, MTCC, Tarlac City, for gross abuse of authority and conduct prejudicial to the service, stemming from her refusal to issue a writ of execution.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Underlying Case:**  Unlawful detainer case (Civil Case No. 8777) ruled in favor of RCP Realty.
*   **Judgment:** MTCC ordered the defendant (Maun) to vacate the premises and pay monthly rent, litigation expenses, and attorney's fees.
*   **Procedural Posture:** Defendant filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiff (represented by Pascual) filed a motion for immediate execution.
*   **MTCC Order (Jan 10, 2006):**  Gave due course to the appeal *and* granted the motion for immediate execution (based on failure to deposit rentals).
*   **Refusal to Issue Writ:** Respondent Martin refused to issue the writ of execution.
*   **Respondent's Justification:**
    *   Complainant lacked legal personality (no board resolution).
    *   Physical inventory of court records.
    *   Defendant not served copy of order granting the writ.
    *   Defendant perfected the appeal.
    *   No supersedeas bond required because no back rentals adjudged.
    *   Respondent deemed the order granting writ AND giving due course to appeal an "illegality"
*   **OCA Recommendation:**  Fine respondent P5,000.00 for acting beyond her authority.
*   **RTC Decision on Appeal (After OCA Recommendation):** Reversed MTCC decision due to lack of jurisdiction/personality to sue.
*   **Complainant's Subsequent Actions:**  Expressed a lack of interest in pursuing the case due to an alleged out-of-court settlement (denied by Respondent) and relocation to Baguio City.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Clerk of Court's Ministerial Duty:** Clerks of Court have a *ministerial* duty to issue writs of execution as directed by the court/judge (citing *Mariano v. Garfin*, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2024; *Sps. Chua v. Court of Appeals*, 350 Phil. 74).  This duty exists even if the clerk believes the order is incorrect.
*   **Limitations on Clerks of Court:** Clerks of Court cannot exercise judicial functions (citing *Miñoso v. Pamulag*, A.M. No. P-05-2067), which would involve the exercise of discretion or judgment. They are administrative assistants to the judge.
*   **Grounds for Immediate Execution in Ejectment Cases:** Failure to perfect appeal, file supersedeas bond, *or* periodically deposit rentals allows immediate execution (Rule 70, Section 19 of the Rules of Court) and duty of the court in this respect being "ministerial and imperative.".
*   **Liability for Misconduct:** Respondent was found guilty of *Simple Misconduct* (citing *Black's Law Dictionary* definition of "Misconduct in office") because of an unwillful unlawful behavior by a public officer in relation to the duties of his office or failure to act in the face of an affirmative duty to act, and fined P5,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Orders:**  The MTCC's issuance of an order granting both the notice of appeal *and* immediate execution created an ambiguity that arguably contributed to the Respondent's confusion. While the SC held that the clerk should have issued the writ *regardless*, the situation could be argued as mitigating.
*   **Impact of RTC Reversal:** While the Supreme Court was clear that the Clerk should have issued the writ regardless of whether the execution was upheld or reversed by the appellate court, the RTC reversal likely played a part in mitigating the penalty.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 19 of the Rules of Court:**  Governs execution pending appeal in ejectment cases.
*   **Mariano v. Garfin, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2024:**  Clerk's ministerial duty to issue writs.
*   **Sps. Chua v. Court of Appeals, 350 Phil. 74:** Reiterates the *ministerial and imperative* duty of the court.
*   **Miñoso v. Pamulag, A.M. No. P-05-2067:** Defines the scope of a clerk's duties.
*   **CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, Resolution No. 99-1936, Rule IV, Sec. 52-B-1** Defines Simple Misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

Marilyn M. Martin was held administratively liable for Simple Misconduct for failing to perform her ministerial duty to issue a writ of execution. The Supreme Court emphasized the limited, administrative role of Clerks of Court and their obligation to follow judicial orders, even if they believe those orders are erroneous. However, the Court imposed only a fine, considering this was her first offense. The case highlights the tension between a clerk's administrative duties and potential concerns about the correctness of judicial orders.
