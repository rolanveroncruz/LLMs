**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Solicitation/Acceptance of Gift (RA 6713 Sec. 7(d)):** Duncano allegedly demanded and collected PhP7,000 from the Lamostes under the guise of bail money for Nathaniel Lamoste, then failed to deposit the money as per procedure.
*   **Loss of Property:** Duncano allegedly caused the loss or unavailability of a Supreme Court EPSON printer.
*   **Dishonesty:** Duncano submitted a false letter-explanation and repair receipt regarding the printer's repair.

**Obligations:**

*   Duncano, as Clerk of Court, had a duty to uphold the integrity of the court and adhere to ethical standards outlined in R.A. No. 6713.
*   Duncano was obligated to follow proper procedures for handling cash bail bonds, including immediate deposit with authorized government depositories.
*   Duncano, as Custodian, was responsible for the safekeeping of court property (the printer).
*   Duncano was obligated to honesty explain missing or lost equipment.

**Liabilities:**

*   Found administratively liable for conduct unbecoming of a court employee.
*   Sanctioned with a two-month suspension.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Recanted Affidavit:** The initial affidavit against Duncano was recanted, raising questions of credibility. However, subsequent investigation showed that Duncano still behaved unethically.
