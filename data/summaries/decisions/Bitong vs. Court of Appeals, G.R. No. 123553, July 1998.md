## Legal Document Summary: *Bitong v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 123553

**Nature:** Derivative suit filed by Nora A. Bitong (Petitioner) on behalf of Mr. & Ms. Publishing Co., Inc. (Mr. & Ms.) against Eugenia D. Apostol, Jose A. Apostol, Letty J. Magsanoc, Adoracion G. Nuyda, and Mr. & Ms. regarding alleged fraud, mismanagement, disloyalty, and conflict of interest.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Bitong alleges she is a registered stockholder and former officer of Mr. & Ms., and the Apostols mismanaged Mr. & Ms., made unauthorized cash advances to Philippine Daily Inquirer (PDI), and used Mr. & Ms. funds for their personal benefit.
*   **Requested Relief:** Injunctions against the Apostols, accounting of profits, reconveyance of assets, damages, appointment of a management committee, and action against PDI.
*   **Respondents' Defense:** The Apostols deny wrongdoing, claiming that Mr. & Ms. operated as a close corporation with implicit consent from stockholders. They also argue that Bitong is not the real party in interest but merely a holder-in-trust for JAKA Investments Corporation (JAKA).
*   **SEC En Banc Decision:** Reversed the Hearing Panel, ordering the Apostols to account for funds and assets, cease managing Mr. & Ms., and declaring the sale of PDI shares to Edgardo B. Espiritu null and void.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Reversed the SEC En Banc, holding that Bitong lacked standing to file the derivative suit as she was not the real party-in-interest (not a genuine shareholder).

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Lack of Standing:** The central issue is whether Bitong had *locus standi* to bring the derivative suit. The Court of Appeals and Supreme Court found that Bitong failed to sufficiently prove she was a *bona fide* stockholder at the time of the alleged wrongdoing.  Her claims of ownership were contradicted by corporate documents, admissions, and inconsistent testimonies. The failure to establish valid transfer of shares under Section 63 of the Corporation Code (delivery and endorsement) is critical.
*   **Mismanagement Allegations:** The alleged mismanagement, while a substantive issue, became secondary to the standing issue. This could have been a significant source of liability.
*   **Voided Sale of PDI Shares:** The SEC En Banc's nullification of the sale of PDI shares to Espiritu, while ultimately overturned, presented a risk of potential liability for the Apostols and exposed Espiritu to the loss of his investment.
*   **Fiduciary Duty Breach:** While ultimately decided against the petitioner, the potential breach of fiduciary duty by directors is a key risk.
*    **Potential liability of Magsanoc and Nuyda**: Accounting of shares paid from cash advances.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **The Corporation Code (BP 68), Section 63:** This provision regarding the issuance and transfer of shares is central to determining Bitong's standing. The case emphasizes the requirements for valid transfer (delivery, endorsement, and recording). The court held that these must be mandatorily complied with and cannot be presumed.
*   **Derivative Suit Doctrine:** The Supreme Court acknowledges the implied right of a stockholder to bring a derivative suit for breach of fiduciary duty, citing *Pascual v. Del Saz Orozeo, 19 Phil. 82 {1911)* and *SMC, represented by Eduardo de los Angeles v. Kahn, G.R. No. 85339, 11 August 1989, 176 SCRA 461*, but emphasizes the requirement of *bona fide* ownership at the time of the complained acts.
*    **Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 US 728, 80 L Ed 1011, 56 Sup Ct 588**: Action for specific performance of an obligation owed by the corporation to the stockholders.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The nature of stock ownership:** The ownership of stock needs to be established by evidence aliunde and not only through books of corporation, especially if these books are questionable.
*   **Judicial Admissions:**  The court found that there was no judicial admission from the private respondents that the petitioner was a stockholder entitling her to a suit on behalf of the corporation.
*   **Nature of business transactions**: The corporation claimed that their relationship was operated like a close corporation, however the validity of those claims was dismissed.
*   **The application of Section 63 of the Corporation Code**: The court found the Section needed to be mandatorily applied in regards to stock transfers.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court ultimately denied Bitong's petition, affirming the Court of Appeals' decision. The case highlights the importance of establishing proper standing in derivative suits and the strict requirements for valid stock transfers under Section 63 of the Corporation Code. The ambiguous claims of ownership and possible collusion led to the final denial of the derivative suit. The case confirms the directors right to corporate power with exceptions by showing an individual cannot sue for the corporation unless authorized by the board.
