Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Ireneo Cahulogan v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 225695, March 21, 2018 (828 Phil. 742)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of RTC conviction for Fencing under Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1612, the "Anti-Fencing Law of 1979."

**Facts:** Cahulogan was convicted of Fencing for knowingly buying 210 cases of Coca-Cola products from Lariosa, a truck helper, who stole them from his employer, Tan.  Tan discovered the unauthorized delivery and attempted to retrieve the goods, but Cahulogan refused, claiming he bought them for P50,000.  The prosecution argued Cahulogan knew or should have known the goods were stolen.  Cahulogan presented no evidence in his defense.

**RTC Ruling:**  Guilty of Fencing.  Elements of the crime established; Lariosa stole the goods, Cahulogan possessed them, and circumstances indicated Cahulogan should have known they were illegally obtained.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction, holding Lariosa's unauthorized sale constituted theft, and Cahulogan's possession created a *prima facie* case of Fencing, which he failed to rebut.

**Issue:** Whether the CA correctly upheld Cahulogan's conviction for Fencing.

**SC Ruling:** Petition DENIED. CA decision AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION of penalty.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **PD 1612 (Anti-Fencing Law):**  Defines Fencing as knowingly dealing in stolen goods with intent to gain (Section 2). Defines a "Fence". Section 3 states the penalties.
*   **Elements of Fencing:**
    *   Robbery or theft occurred.
    *   Accused, not a principal or accomplice in the underlying crime, buys, receives, etc., goods derived from the crime.
    *   Accused knew or should have known the goods were stolen.
    *   Intent to gain.
*   **Prima Facie Evidence (Section 5, PD 1612):** Mere possession of stolen goods creates a *prima facie* presumption of Fencing. This shifts the burden to the accused to prove they are not a Fence. *Ong v. People* highlights the importance of contextual circumstances indicating knowledge of illegal source.
*   **Malum Prohibitum:** The Court reiterates Fencing is *malum prohibitum*, not *malum in se*.
*   **Intent to Gain:** Proven by the discount price Cahulogan allegedly paid.
*   **Circumstances:** Sale without receipts, deviation from standard business practices (no empty bottle exchange) were crucial in establishing Cahulogan's knowledge.

**Penalty & Indeterminate Sentence Law:**
The Court modified the penalty to an indeterminate sentence of four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum. *Peralta v. People* cited and applied: Where the penalty in a special law uses terminology from the Revised Penal Code, the Indeterminate Sentence Law applies.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Incongruence of Penalties:** The SC explicitly acknowledges a significant issue.  RA 10951 amended Article 309 of the RPC, adjusting values for theft penalties, but no similar adjustment was made to PD 1612. This could result in Fences receiving harsher penalties than the principals of the underlying theft, which the court admits is a possible injustice. The court highlights the issue and urges Legislative action on incongruence of penalties where fencing might be penalized more severely than theft due to RA 10951 adjustments.
*   **Accessory vs. Principal:** The court cites *Dizon-Pamintuan v. People* and notes the Fence could theoretically be charged as an accessory to theft or as a principal in Fencing. Prosecution under PD 1612 is preferred due to harsher penalties.
*   **Legislative Action Needed:** Due to the incongruence issue, the Court forwarded the decision to Congress and the President (through the Department of Justice) for review and potential legislative action. This acknowledges a structural problem requiring a legal solution.

**Key Case Law:**

*   *Ong v. People* (708 Phil. 565 (2013)): Elements of Fencing, presumption from possession, circumstances indicating knowledge.
*   *Dizon-Pamintuan v. People* (G.R. No. 111426, July 11, 1994): Fence as accessory or principal; preference for PD 1612.
*   *Peralta v. People* (G.R. No. 221991, August 30, 2017): Indeterminate Sentence Law and special penal laws.
