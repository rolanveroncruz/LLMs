## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cadampog*, G.R. No. 218244 (2018)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Ardin Cuesta Cadampog*

**Court & Date:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division, June 13, 2018.

**Nature of Case:** Appeal of a conviction for Murder, qualified by treachery, stemming from a shooting incident.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Accused-appellant Ardin Cadampog was charged with Murder under the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Facts:** The victim was shot while having dinner. The victim's wife, Alicia Napoles, identified Ardin as the shooter.
*   **Identification:** The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' finding of positive identification of Ardin as the perpetrator, relying heavily on the testimony of Alicia Napoles, the victim's wife. The Court emphasized that she had the opportunity to observe the circumstances of the crime and her testimony that she shouted Ardinâ€™s name just after seeing him running away from the scene.
*   **Treachery:** The Court affirmed the finding of treachery, emphasizing that the attack was sudden, unexpected, and left the victim defenseless. Shooting through bamboo slats while the victim was having supper constituted *alevosia*.
*   **Alibi/Defense:** The defense of alibi was rejected by the lower court and not overturned.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Conviction:** Affirmed conviction for Murder.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion Perpetua* (life imprisonment) with accessory penalties.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: Increased to Php 75,000
    *   Moral Damages: Increased to Php 75,000
    *   Exemplary Damages: Increased to Php 75,000
    *   Interest: 6% per annum on all damages from finality of judgment until fully paid.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**  Basis for the murder charge.
*   ***People v. Caliso*, 675 Phil. 742, 752 (2011):**  Cited regarding the burden on the prosecution to prove the identity of the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification Issues:** Ardin argued that Alicia could not have clearly seen his face. The Supreme Court, however, credited her testimony, citing her familiarity with the accused.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The prosecution's case heavily relied on circumstantial evidence (witness accounts of Ardin's clothing and direction of travel).
*   **Treachery Application:** The determination of treachery is critical. The defense could argue the shooting through the bamboo slats was not specifically designed to ensure the crime's execution without risk to the perpetrator, but was rather an action in the course of committing a single unplanned crime.
