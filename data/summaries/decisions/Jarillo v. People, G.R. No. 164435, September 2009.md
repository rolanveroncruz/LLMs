## Legal Document Summary: *Jarillo v. People*, G.R. No. 164435

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the conviction of Victoria S. Jarillo for Bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code. The Supreme Court (SC) partly granted the petition, modifying the penalty but affirming the conviction.

**Key Facts:**

*   Jarillo married Rafael Alocillo in 1974 (civil) and 1975 (church).
*   While the first marriage was subsisting, she married Emmanuel Uy in 1979.
*   Uy filed for annulment in 1999 (Civil Case No. 99-93582).
*   Jarillo was charged with Bigamy in 2000.
*   Later, in 2003, Jarillo's marriage to Alocillo was declared void *ab initio* based on Alocillo's psychological incapacity (Civil Case No. 00-1217, Makati RTC).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Article 349, Revised Penal Code (Bigamy):** Penalizes contracting a second marriage while a valid first marriage subsists.
*   **Prejudicial Question:** Jarillo argued the nullity case for her first marriage (Alocillo) and the annulment case of the second marriage (Uy) were prejudicial questions requiring suspension of the bigamy trial.
*   **Validity of First Marriage:** Jarillo claimed her marriages to Alocillo were void from the beginning because he was already married to someone else. She also claimed no valid marriage license.
*   **Prescription:** Jarillo claimed the bigamy charge had prescribed because Uy allegedly knew of her first marriage in 1978.
*   **Penalty:** Jarillo alleged the imposed penalty was erroneous.

**Ruling:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed (Modified Penalty):** The SC upheld the conviction, modifying the penalty to a term from Two (2) years, Four (4) months and One (1) day of prision correccional, as minimum, to 8 years and 1 day of prision mayor, as maximum.
*   **Prejudicial Question Rejected:** The SC cited *Marbella-Bobis v. Bobis* and *Abunado v. People*, holding that a pending nullity case does not prevent prosecution for bigamy.  The critical fact is whether the first marriage subsisted *at the time* the second marriage was contracted.
*   **Subsequent Declaration of Nullity Irrelevant:** The subsequent declaration of nullity of the first marriage *ab initio* does not negate the fact that the crime of bigamy was already consummated. The presumption is that the first marriage was valid and subsisting at the time the second marriage was contracted.
*   **Lack of Proof of Prescription:** Jarillo failed to prove Uy's knowledge of the first marriage prior to the prescriptive period.  The burden of proof lies with the defendant. Hearsay evidence was deemed insufficient. Citing *Sermonia v. Court of Appeals* prescriptive period begins upon discovery by offended party, authorities or their agents.
*   **Validity of Second Marriage (Annulment) Irrelevant:** The SC cited *Tenebro v. Court of Appeals*, affirming that the nullity of the second marriage (to Uy) is not a defense against bigamy because the crime is based on the act of contracting the *second* marriage during the subsistence of a valid first marriage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 349:**  Defines and penalizes bigamy.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 25:** Classifies penalties.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Articles 90 & 91:** Prescription of crimes.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Governs the imposition of indeterminate penalties.
*   ***Marbella-Bobis v. Bobis*, 391 Phil. 648 (2000):**  Establishes that a pending nullity case is not a prejudicial question in a bigamy case.
*   ***Abunado v. People*, G.R. No. 159218, March 30, 2004:** Reaffirms that the subsequent declaration of nullity of the first marriage is immaterial if bigamy was already committed.
*   ***Tenebro v. Court of Appeals*, 467 Phil. 723 (2004):**  Holds that the nullity of the second marriage is not a defense in a bigamy charge.
*   ***Sermonia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 109454, June 14, 1994:** Specifies that the prescriptive period begins when the crime is discovered.
*   ***Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc. v. Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, Inc.*, G.R. No. 151890, June 20, 2006:** Standard for the burden of proof.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Harsh Application of the Law:** While the SC reduced the penalty for humanitarian reasons (final nullity declaration and psychological abuse), the strict application of the law in bigamy cases can be perceived as harsh, especially when the first marriage is subsequently declared void *ab initio*.
*   **Future Reliance:**  The case reinforces the precedent that a subsequent declaration of nullity, even if *ab initio*, is not a valid defense against bigamy, and that the second marriage validity does not matter.
* **Evidentiary Issues:** The reliance on hearsay evidence and the failure to adequately prove knowledge or prescription timelines highlighted evidentiary weaknesses in the defense strategy.

**Recommendations:**

This case underscores the importance of obtaining a judicial declaration of nullity *before* contracting a subsequent marriage. It also highlights the challenges in successfully asserting defenses like prescription or lack of a valid marriage license without strong, corroborating evidence.
