## Legal Document Summary: Castro vs. Deloria, et al. (G.R. No. 163586)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Sharon Castro's petition questioning the Ombudsman's authority to file a Malversation of Public Funds case against her before the RTC. The core issue revolves around the application of the Supreme Court's conflicting rulings in *Uy v. Sandiganbayan* regarding the Ombudsman's prosecutorial powers over cases cognizable by the RTC, specifically during the period between the original *Uy* decision (August 9, 1999) and its subsequent resolution (March 20, 2001). The SC held that the Ombudsman did have authority to investigate and prosecute the petitioner's case

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Sharon Castro, a Revenue Officer I, was charged with Malversation of Public Funds (P556,681.53) before the RTC, Branch 65, Guimaras.
*   **Motion to Quash:** Castro filed a Motion to Quash, arguing the Ombudsman lacked jurisdiction and authority to conduct the preliminary investigation and file the Information, citing the original *Uy v. Sandiganbayan* case. She claimed her salary grade placed her case outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC denied the Motion, holding that jurisdiction depended on the penalty imposable, not salary grade, and that the Ombudsman's prosecutorial authority was recognized in the clarified *Uy* ruling. Also cited procedural delay in filing the motion.
*   **CA Dismissal:** CA dismissed Castro's petition for Certiorari.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Ombudsman's Authority:** Did the Ombudsman have the authority to file the Information in May 2000, given the initial *Uy v. Sandiganbayan* ruling?
2.  **Retroactivity:** Can the clarified *Uy* resolution (March 20, 2001) be applied retroactively to Castro's case without violating ex post facto principles and due process?

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Castro is obligated to face trial for Malversation of Public Funds.
*   The Ombudsman has the obligation to prosecute the case.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction:** Castro faces potential conviction for Malversation of Public Funds if the prosecution succeeds.
*   **Procedural Issues:** Issues of jurisdiction and the validity of the information may be raised during the appeal process.

**Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Uy v. Sandiganbayan (G.R. No. 180214, August 9, 1999 and March 20, 2001):** Central to the case; addresses the scope of the Ombudsman's prosecutorial powers.
*   **Office of the Ombudsman v. Enoc (G.R. Nos. 145957-68, January 25, 2002):** Similar case invoking the *Uy* ruling.
*   **Office of Ombudsman v. Hon. Breva (G.R. No. 145938, February 10, 2006):** Similar case also citing the *Uy* ruling.
*   **Ombudsman Act (RA 6770):** Statute defining the powers and jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 117, Sec. 1** (Motion to Quash Rules)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The retrospective application of the clarified *Uy* ruling, particularly regarding its potential impact on ex post facto principles and due process. The Court determined that this did not amount to an ex post facto law as it was merely interpreting a pre-existing law.
