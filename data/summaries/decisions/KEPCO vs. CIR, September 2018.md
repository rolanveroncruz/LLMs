**Re:** KEPCO ILIJAN CORPORATION vs. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, G.R. No. 205185

**Summary of Decision**

The Supreme Court (SC) partly granted KEPCO Ilijan Corporation's (KEPCO) petition for review on certiorari, reversing the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc (CTA En Banc) decision that denied KEPCO's claim for a refund of input Value-Added Tax (VAT) for the 2002 taxable year. The SC remanded the case to the CTA in Division for further proceedings regarding KEPCO's input VAT refund claims for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2002.

**Key Provisions and Issues**

*   **Refund Claim:** KEPCO sought a refund of â‚±74,658,461.68 in excess input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales to the National Power Corporation (NPC) for the 2002 taxable year.
*   **Prescriptive Periods:** The central issue concerns the interpretation and application of Section 112(A) and (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997 regarding the prescriptive periods for filing administrative and judicial claims for VAT refunds.
*   **Timeliness of Administrative Claim:** The Court found the administrative claim for the first quarter of 2002 to be filed belatedly. The claims for the second, third and fourth quarters were deemed timely filed.
*   **Timeliness of Judicial Claim:** KEPCO filed its judicial claim nine (9) days after filing the administrative claim, before the expiration of the 120-day period granted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) to act on the administrative claim.

**Case Law and Statutory References**

*   **Section 112(A) and (C) of the NIRC:** Governing the periods for filing administrative and judicial claims for VAT refunds/tax credit certificates.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. San Roque Power Corporation, G.R. No. 187485:** Clarifies the effectivity of the pronouncements in *Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue* and *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Mirant Pagbilao Corporation* on the reckoning of the two-year prescriptive period.
*   **Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Aichi Forging Company of Asia, Inc., G.R. No. 184823:** Established the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the 120-day period for the CIR to act on administrative claims and the 30-day period for the taxpayer to appeal to the CTA.
*   **BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03:** Interim period when premature filing in the CTA was allowed.

**Obligations and Liabilities**

*   **KEPCO:** Obligated to provide sufficient documentary evidence to support its VAT refund claims for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2002 upon remand to the CTA in Division.
*   **CIR:** Obligated to process and make a determination on KEPCO's valid claims, provided the same are properly supported with documentary evidence.
*   **CTA in Division:** Obligated to conduct further proceedings to determine the validity and amount of refund due to KEPCO for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of 2002.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses**

*   **Burden of Proof:** KEPCO bears the burden of proving its entitlement to the VAT refund by presenting sufficient documentary evidence. The absence or inadequacy of such evidence could result in the denial of the claim.
*   **120+30 day rule:** The Court ruled that, because KEPCO filed its judicial claims during the BIR Ruling No. DA-489-03, the CTA could take cognizance of the claims without waiting for the expiration of the 120 day period.
*   **Application of *San Roque*:** The SC applied *San Roque* principles concerning when to reckon the two-year prescriptive period for filing an administrative claim for refund, clarifying prior jurisprudence.

**Legal Strategy**

*   Upon remand to the CTA in Division, KEPCO must ensure the comprehensive and organized presentation of all required documentary evidence to support its refund claims for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters of 2002.
*   The CTA in Division should be guided by the SC's ruling and the provisions of the NIRC.
