**Legal Document Summary - *Factor v. Martel***

**Case:** *Norma S. Factor, et al. v. Antonio V. Martel, Jr.* G.R. No. 161037, February 4, 2008 (567 Phil. 521)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's issuance of a writ of possession.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC correctly issued a writ of possession in favor of Martel (later substituted by Ng) regarding land claimed by the Factors.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision and *dismissed* the LRC case for writ of possession.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**
*   Martel (subsequently Ng) sought a writ of possession based on an earlier Pasig RTC decision (LRC Case No. N-9049) that reversed a prior decision in favor of the Factors and confirmed ownership in Martel's predecessor.
*   Factors opposed, arguing the writ was inappropriate because (1) it was outside the original land registration proceeding and (2) LRC Case No. N-9049 was still pending appeal.

**Liabilities/Risks:**
*   **Ng:** Risk of continuing litigation. No right to a writ of possession in this case; must file an *accion reinvindicatoria* (action to recover ownership) in the RTC against the Factors. The ruling in LRC Case No. N-9049, even if affirmed, needs proper execution per Rule 39, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which was not followed here. Reliance on an ex-parte motion for a writ of possession was procedurally improper given the Factors' possession and claim of ownership. Potential liability for legal costs if the *accion reinvindicatoria* is unsuccessful.
*   **Factors:** Risk of losing an *accion reinvindicatoria* case if Ng can establish superior title. Their claim of continuous possession since time immemorial, while persuasive in the writ of possession context, will be scrutinized in a plenary action.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**
*   **Act No. 496, Section 17 (Land Registration Act):**  Discussed as the basis for issuing writs of possession in land registration proceedings. The Court held this inapplicable as the Factors were not parties to the *original* land registration case.
*   **Act No. 3135, Section 7 (Extrajudicial Foreclosure):** Cited in the general discussion of instances where a writ of possession may be issued but irrelevant to the specific facts.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 34:** Mandates application of the Rules of Court to land registration cases in a suppletory manner.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 1:** Emphasized regarding proper execution of judgments, specifically the requirement of filing the motion for execution in the *same case* and submitting certified true copies of the judgment.
*   ***Serra Serra v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. Nos. 34080 and 34693, March 22, 1991, 195 SCRA 482):** Key case cited for the principle that a writ of possession can only issue against adverse occupants during the proceedings up to the issuance of the decree, and the inappropriateness of the writ against those possessing for 10+ years who entered possession after the final decree, who also were not party to the original action.
*   ***Bernas v. Nuevo* (Nos. L-58438 and L-60423, January 31, 1984, 127 SCRA 399):**  Cited to reinforce the principle that possessors claiming ownership cannot be summarily ousted via writ of possession; they are entitled to their day in court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **The nature of the Factor's possession:**  Ng argued that the Factors' claim of possession "since time immemorial" in LRC Case No. N-9049 subjected them to a writ of possession related to the *original* registration.  The Court rejected this, emphasizing that the Factors weren't parties to the *original* case and the relevant period for determining eligibility for a writ of possession is during the original registration proceedings. This is now a key fact in the case as to the proper remedy of Ng to file for *accion reinvindicatoria.*
*   **Procedural Short-cut attempt:** Ng attempted to execute the Pasig RTC decision (LRC Case No. N-9049) through the Las Pi√±as RTC petition (LRC Case No. 02-0030), which the Court deemed an improper "procedural short-cut."

**Potential Issues and Considerations:**
*   Ng's chances in an *accion reinvindicatoria* will depend on the strength of his predecessor's title derived from OCT No. 25 and the Pasig RTC decision. The Factors' defense will likely hinge on prescription, laches, or challenging the validity of the title.
*   Finality of Pasig RTC decision - critical for initiating *accion reinvindicatoria.*
*   Factual determination of possession is the court going to see Factors possession of the land "since time immemorial" as continuous?
