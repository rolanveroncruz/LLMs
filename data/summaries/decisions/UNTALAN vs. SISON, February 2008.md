## Legal Document Summary - *Untalan v. Sison* (Adm. Matter No. RTJ-92-822)

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against a judge for gross ignorance of the law and partiality.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Respondent Judge Sison granted bail to accused in a double murder case (Crim. Case No. D-10678) with undue haste.
*   Judge Sison failed to provide the prosecution with the required three-day notice of the bail hearing, violating Rule 15, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.
*   Judge Sison granted bail without allowing the prosecution to present evidence demonstrating the strength of evidence against the accused (capital offense).
*   The Court of Appeals nullified the orders granting bail and denying reconsideration due to grave abuse of discretion (CA-G.R. SP No. 28384).

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to adhere to procedural rules regarding bail hearings, including providing adequate notice and affording the prosecution an opportunity to present evidence.
*   Judges must avoid acting with haste or showing partiality in judicial proceedings.

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Sison found guilty of gross ignorance of the law.
*   Sanctioned with a fine of P20,000, deducted from any remaining accrued leave credits, despite already being dismissed from service in a separate case (A.M. No. 99-731-RTJ).

**Potential Risks:**

*   Judges risk disciplinary action, including fines, suspension, or dismissal, for failing to follow established legal procedures and for demonstrating bias.
*   Premature or improperly granted bail can result in accused individuals absconding, undermining the judicial process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 15, Section 4, Rules of Court:** Requires three-day notice of hearings.
*   **People v. Hon. Procopio Donato, G.R. No. 79269, June 5, 1991:** Emphasizes the prosecution's right to present evidence in bail hearings.
*   **Libaros v. Dabalos, A.M. No. RTJ-89-286, July 11, 1991, 199 SCRA 48 (1991):** Cited as basis for the fine imposed.
*   **De Guzman, Jr. v. Sison, A.M. No. RTJ-01-1629, March 26, 2001, 355 SCRA 69:** Notes the respondent's prior dismissal, impacting available sanctions.
*   **Bagano v. Hontanosas, A.M. No. RTJ-05-1915, May 6, 2005, 458 SCRA 59; Leonidas v. Supnet, A.M. No. MTJ-02-1433, February 21, 2003, 398 SCRA 38:** Established precedent for imposing sanctions even after dismissal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether the prosecution adequately requested an opportunity to present evidence is arguable. The court suggests the pleadings contained "clear reminders" even if not specific requests.
*   The justification for the haste in granting bail, based on the accused's detention, is weak and does not excuse procedural violations.
