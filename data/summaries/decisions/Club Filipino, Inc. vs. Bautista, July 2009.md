**Legal Document Summary: Club Filipino, Inc. vs. Bautista, G.R. No. 168406**

**Nature:** Resolution of a Petition for Review on Certiorari involving a strike declared illegal by the Labor Arbiter and NLRC, but reversed by the Court of Appeals (CA).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CBA Negotiation:** Club Filipino had a CBA with the Club Filipino Employees Association (Union) that expired May 31, 2000. The company failed to meaningfully negotiate a new CBA, prompting the union to file for preventive mediation and ultimately a notice of strike.
*   **Notice of Strike Requirements (Rule XXII, Section 4 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code):** The notice of strike must state unresolved issues and, "as far as practicable," include the union's proposals, the employer's counter-proposals, and proof of a request for a conference.
*   **Legality of Strike:** Issue of whether a strike staged by the union on May 26, 2001, was legal. The Labor Arbiter declared the strike procedurally infirm because the union failed to attach its CBA proposal and the companyâ€™s counterproposal.
*   **Termination of Union Officers:** The company sought to terminate union officers for participating in an illegal strike.

**Liabilities:**

*   The CA held Club Filipino liable to pay backwages, benefits, and separation pay to the union officers (Sualog, Calida, De Guzman, and Arinto) from the time of their dismissal until the finality of the CA decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reversal by Supreme Court (Resolved):** Club Filipino sought to reverse the CA decision arguing that the strike was illegal.
*   **Further Litigation:** While the Supreme Court denied the petition (affirming CA) this does not preclude future disputes regarding the calculation and implementation of the backwages, benefits and separation pay.

*   **_Stamford Marketing Corp. v. Julian, G.R. No. 145496, 24 February 2004, 423 SCRA 633, 648._** A strike made a distinction between union officers and members who participated thereon.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The phrase "as far as practicable" in Rule XXII, Section 4, of the Implementing Rules was subject to interpretation. The Supreme Court held that it was *not* practicable for the Union to include the company's counter-proposal as it did not exist at the time the strike notice was filed due to the company's delay in providing it.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court *denied* the petition, affirming the CA's decision.  The strike was deemed legal because the union could not practicably include the employer's counter-proposal in its notice of strike since the counter-proposal was not yet submitted at the time of filing of the notice of strike. The automatic dismissal of the union officers was also deemed without basis, since there was no discussion of how the union officers knowingly participated in the illegal strike.
