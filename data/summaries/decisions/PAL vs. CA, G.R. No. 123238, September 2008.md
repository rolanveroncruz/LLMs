## Legal Document Summary - *Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and Spouses Manuel S. Buncio, et al.* (G.R. No. 123238, September 22, 2008)

**Case Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC ruling which held Philippine Airlines (PAL) liable for breach of contract of carriage and awarded damages to the respondents due to the loss of an indemnity bond resulting in unaccompanied minor passengers being stranded.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** PAL entered into a contract of carriage with respondents to transport unaccompanied minors Deanna and Nikolai Buncio from Manila to San Francisco, and then from San Francisco to Los Angeles via a connecting flight (United Airways 996).
*   **Indemnity Bond:** PAL required and received an indemnity bond from the parents of the minors as a condition for transporting them as unaccompanied minors. PAL was responsible to produce this bond for the connecting flight.
*   **Duty of Utmost Diligence:** As a common carrier, PAL is bound by law (Articles 1733 and 1755 of the New Civil Code) to exercise extraordinary diligence and utmost care for the safety and welfare of its passengers.

**Liabilities & Damages:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** PAL breached the contract by failing to ensure the minors were transported on their connecting flight due to the loss of the indemnity bond.
*   **Moral Damages:** The Supreme Court upheld the award of moral damages. The Court found that the loss of the bond constituted gross negligence which amounted to bad faith. Precedent cited: *Singson v. Court of Appeals* and *Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded due to PAL's reckless and malevolent conduct. This required the Court to confirm the entitlement to moral damages under Article 2234 of the Civil Code. Article 2232 was cited.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Supreme Court *deleted* the award for attorney's fees, finding the RTC failed to provide legal or factual justification for the award in its decision. Referencing *Serrano v. Gutierrez* and *Ballesteros v. Abion*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Gross Negligence vs. Ordinary Negligence:** PAL argued that the loss was mere carelessness and not gross negligence/bad faith. The Court disagreed, emphasizing the heightened standard of care for common carriers, particularly regarding unaccompanied minors.
*   **Cause of the Loss:** PAL attempted to shift blame to the Honolulu immigration office. This was unsuccessful as the Court held it was PAL's ultimate responsibility to verify that the bond was in hand.
*   **Assessment of Damages:** The quantum of moral and exemplary damages was challenged as excessive. The Court upheld the awards based on the circumstances and the need for deterrence.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The Court applied a 6% per annum interest from the date of extrajudicial demand (July 17, 1980) until finality of the decision, and 12% per annum thereafter until satisfaction, following *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Articles 1733 & 1755, New Civil Code:** Standard of extraordinary diligence required of common carriers.
*   **Article 2216, Civil Code:** Discretion of the court to assess damages.
*   **Article 2232, Civil Code:** Exemplary damages in breach of contract.
*   **Article 2234, Civil Code:** Requirement for moral damages as a predicate to exemplary damages.

**Case Law:**

*   **Japan Airlines v. Asuncion:** Contract of carriage obligations.
*   **Singson v. Court of Appeals:** Carrier's utter lack of care constitutes gross negligence.
*   **Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Carrier's inattention amounts to bad faith.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** Legal interest rates.
*    **Serrano v. Gutierrez, Ballesteros v. Abion:** Award of Attorney's fees must be with justification.

**Overall Assessment:**

This case highlights the high standard of care imposed on common carriers, particularly regarding vulnerable passengers like unaccompanied minors. PAL's failure to exercise even slight care regarding the indemnity bond justified the award of moral and exemplary damages. The deletion of the attorney's fees underscores the importance of providing a factual and legal basis for such awards in the decision itself.
