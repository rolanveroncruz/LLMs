**Case Summary: Ramones v. Spouses Guimoc, Jr. and Guimoc (G.R. No. 226645, August 13, 2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's deletion of an award of civil liabilities in a criminal case for Other Forms of Swindling under Article 316(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Facts:**

*   Respondents (Spouses Guimoc) were charged with swindling for obtaining a loan from Petitioner (Ramones) using a property already mortgaged as collateral.
*   MTC initially found Elenita guilty and ordered both spouses to pay civil liabilities (P507,000.00 and P60,000.00, respectively).
*   RTC acquitted Elenita but maintained the civil liabilities.  Issue of non-payment of correct filing fees was raised but not ruled upon.
*   CA initially affirmed RTC, but on reconsideration, deleted the award of damages due to alleged non-payment of proper docket fees based on Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 (SC Circular No. 35-2004).

**Issue:** Did the CA correctly delete the award of damages due to alleged non-payment of proper docket fees?

**Ruling:** No.  The Supreme Court granted the petition and reinstated the award of damages.

**Key Provisions and Legal Principles:**

*   **Rule 111 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure:**  Generally, no filing fees are required for actual damages in criminal cases.
*   **Section 21, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court (as amended by A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC/SC Circular No. 35-2004):** Filing fees are required in estafa cases if the offended party fails to manifest within 15 days after the information is filed that the civil liability will be separately prosecuted.
*   **Manchester Doctrine (Manchester Development Corporation v. CA, 233 Phil. 579 (1987)):**  Jurisdiction acquired upon payment of prescribed docket fees.
*   **Sun Insurance Office, Ltd v. Asuncion, 252 Phil. 280 (1989):** Clarified Manchester; when insufficient filing fees are initially paid and there is no intent to defraud, the Manchester rule does not apply. Court acquires jurisdiction subject to payment of deficiency. Good faith payment based on the clerk of court's assessment gives the court jurisdiction subject to the payment of deficiencies.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Payment of full docket fees *as assessed by the Clerk of Court* vests jurisdiction, even if the assessment is deficient, absent intent to defraud (Rivera v. del Rosario, 464 Phil. 783 (2004); Fil-Estate Golf and Development, Inc. v. Navarro, 553 Phil. 48 (2007); United Overseas Bank v. Ros, 556 Phil. 178 (2007); The Heirs of Reinoso, Sr. v. CA, 669 Phil. 272 (2011)).
*   **Estoppel by Laches (United Overseas Bank v. Ros):**  A party cannot invoke the court's jurisdiction for relief and later question it, especially after a significant delay (5 years in this case).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Respondents (Spouses Guimoc) are liable to pay Petitioner (Ramones) P507,000.00 and P60,000.00, respectively.
*   MTC is directed to determine deficient docket fees, constituting a lien on the judgment.
*   Legal interest of 12% per annum from June 30, 2006 (filing of Information) to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment is applicable per *Nacar v. Gallery Frames* 716 Phil. 267 [2013].
*   Petitioner is obligated to pay any deficiency in docket fees as assessed by the MTC.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Assessment of Deficiency:** Potential dispute over the correct amount of deficient docket fees to be assessed by the MTC.
*   **Enforcement:** Enforcing the judgment against the respondents may present practical challenges.
*   **Argument of insufficient evidence for estafa:**  Although the criminal aspect is not the focus of this case, the underlying facts of the transaction could be subject to further scrutiny in other legal proceedings.
