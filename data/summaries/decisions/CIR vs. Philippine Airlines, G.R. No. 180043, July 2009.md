## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. PAL (G.R. No. 180043)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc's decision affirming the CTA Division's grant of PAL's claim for refund of Overseas Communications Tax (OCT) for April-December 2001.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Section 120 NIRC (1997):** Imposes 10% OCT on overseas dispatches, messages, or conversations originating from the Philippines, payable by the person paying for the service.
*   **PD 1590, Section 13:** PAL's franchise grants it the option to pay either: (a) basic corporate income tax; or (b) 2% franchise tax on gross revenues, whichever is lower, "in lieu of all other taxes," except real property tax.
*   **Core Dispute:** Whether PAL is entitled to an OCT refund despite incurring a net loss in 2001 (resulting in zero basic corporate income tax liability) and not actually paying the franchise tax. The CIR argues the "in lieu of all other taxes" provision is conditional on *actual payment* of either tax.
*   **Amount in Controversy:** P126,243.80, representing substantiated OCT payments for April-December 2001.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **PAL:** Obligation to choose between the basic corporate income tax or franchise tax under Section 13 of PD 1590.
*   **PLDT:** Obligation to collect and remit OCT under Section 120 NIRC.
*   **CIR:** Responsible for assessing and collecting national internal revenue taxes, including OCT.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of "In Lieu Of All Other Taxes" Clause:** The primary contentious point revolves around interpreting whether actual payment of either corporate income tax or franchise tax is a *precondition* for the "in lieu of all other taxes" exemption to apply. The CIR argues it is, while PAL argues it is not, based on the *option* granted and the potential for a net loss resulting in zero liability.
*   **"Pay" in PD 1590 Section 13:** Focus on whether the meaning of the term can and should also mean it applies even if no payment has been made as PAL has zero liability for basic corporate income tax.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **NIRC (1997), Section 120:** Governs OCT imposition.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1590, Section 13:** PAL's franchise and the "in lieu of all other taxes" clause.
*   **CIR v. Philippine Airlines, Inc. (G.R. No. 160528):** The Supreme Court previously ruled that even with a net loss, PAL was exempt from final withholding tax on interest income under Section 13 of PD 1590. This case is cited as precedent.
*   **BIR Ruling No. 97-94:** Not critical to the core issue, but cited as a prior BIR interpretation of PAL's tax exemption.

**Decision & Reasoning:**

*   **The Supreme Court denied the CIR's petition, affirming the CTA's decision granting the OCT refund to PAL.**
*   **Rationale:**
    *   The "in lieu of all other taxes" provision in PD 1590 does not require *actual payment* of either basic corporate income tax or franchise tax as a condition for the exemption.  The *exercise of the option* to pay either tax is sufficient.
    *   PD 1590 recognized the possibility of net losses, evidenced by the net loss carry-over provision. Therefore, a zero tax liability due to a net loss still allows PAL to avail itself of the tax exemption.
    *   The PAL case (G.R. No. 160528) is relevant as it established that the "in lieu of all other taxes" provision applies even when PAL did not pay the basic corporate income tax due to its net loss.
    *   Tax refunds are construed *strictissimi juris* but, when the claim has a clear legal basis and is supported by evidence, it will be granted.
    *   The CTA's factual finding of P126,243.80 substantiated OCT payments is binding on the Supreme Court.
