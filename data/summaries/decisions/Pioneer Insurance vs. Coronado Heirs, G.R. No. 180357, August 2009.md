**Legal Document Summary: *Pioneer Insurance and Surety Corporation v. Heirs of Vicente Coronado***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 180357, August 04, 2009, 612 Phil. 573.

**Nature of Document:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a CA decision affirming the RTC's judgment regarding a complaint for Annulment of Title and/or Reconveyance.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Pioneer Insurance and Surety Corporation (PISC) – Title holder via foreclosure.
*   **Respondents:** Heirs of Vicente Coronado, et al. – Claimants of the land based on inheritance and possession from Doroteo Garcia.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Core Dispute:** Respondents sought to annul PISC's TCT No. N-19781, claiming it covered a portion of their inherited land. PISC derived its title from a mortgage foreclosure on a property originally owned by Gaudencio Bocobo.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** The RTC recognized the Coronados' ownership of their ancestral land but refused to annul PISC's title, finding that PISC's property was located elsewhere.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC.
*   **Supreme Court Issue:** Whether the lower courts erred in effectively modifying PISC's title (by stating it was not located where the certificate stated), based on survey reports that were incomplete as they had surveyed the Coronado land, but not PISC's.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PISC:** Holds a Torrens title (TCT No. N-19781). Its initial obligation was to defend its title. Now it has the burden of assisting the RTC in accurately determining the location of its property.
*   **Heirs of Coronado:** Obligation to demonstrate the validity of their claim to the specific land and potentially reconcile their claim with PISC's title.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Title Indefeasibility vs. Factual Error:** The core issue is whether PISC's title is truly indefeasible if the stated location on the title is demonstrably incorrect or misleading. This is a potential risk for PISC. See *Odsigue v. Court of Appeals*, regarding conclusive evidence not only of ownership but also of location of the property.
*   **Survey Discrepancies:** The conflicting survey reports (Unciano and Pangyarihan vs. Mercado) highlight the difficulty in establishing the accurate location and boundaries.
*   **Prescription and Laches:** PISC argued the respondents' claim was barred by prescription and laches. This argument was dismissed due to respondents' continuous possession. However, prescription and laches may resurface as issues if the respondents fail to establish a clear link between their property and the land covered by PISC's title.
*   **Ambiguity:** Ambiguity exists in the technical descriptions and locations as stated on the titles and survey plans. This ambiguity is central to the dispute and the Supreme Court decision.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The SC mentions *David v. Malay, 376 Phil. 825, 837 (1999)*, establishing that the right to seek reconveyance to quiet title does not prescribe when the claimant is in actual possession.
*   *Odsigue v. Court of Appeals*, is cited noting that a certificate of title is conclusive evidence not only of ownership but also of location of the property.

**Statutory References:**

*   Implicit references to the Torrens System and laws governing land registration.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court SET ASIDE the CA decision and REMANDED the case to the RTC for further proceedings to determine the exact location of PISC's property. The SC found the lower courts' decision was premature, as their verification surveys focused on the subject property (Coronados' claim) without adequately surveying PISC's property or plotting the tie lines in the title.

**Implications/Actionable Items:**

*   The RTC must conduct a thorough survey of the property covered by PISC's TCT No. N-19781.
*   PISC has the burden of proving its title covers a specific location.
*   The Heirs of Coronado must provide evidence supporting their claim to the portion of the property in the name of PISC.
