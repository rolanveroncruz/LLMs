**Case Summary: *Skippers United Pacific, Inc. vs. Estelito S. Lagne***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 217036, August 20, 2018

**Issue:** Whether the seafarer's (Lagne) colorectal cancer is work-related and thus compensable under the POEA-SEC.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling in favor of the seafarer, Lagne. It found his illness, Rectosigmoid Adenocarcinoma, compensable as it was work-connected and existed during his employment contract.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC:** Governs the employment of Filipino seafarers. Section 20(B)(4) requires work-related injury/illness to exist during the contract for disability compensation.
*   **Work-Related Illness Definition (POEA-SEC):** Sickness resulting in disability or death from occupational disease listed in Section 32-A, or, for unlisted illnesses, proven to be caused or aggravated by work conditions.
*   **Sickness Allowance (Section 20 (B) (3) of the POEA-SEC):** Entitlement to basic wage until declared fit or permanent disability is assessed, up to 120 days. Employer obligated to pay if not already paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Skippers United Pacific, Inc. and/or Ikarian Moon Shipping, Co., Ltd.):** Liable to pay Lagne:
    *   USD $1,860 as sickness allowance
    *   USD $60,000.00 as disability benefits
    *   10% of the money awards as attorney's fees.

**Reasoning & Case Law:**

*   **Substantial Evidence Rule:** While not explicitly mentioned in the body of the decision, underlying the entire discourse on evidence is the substantial evidence rule, requiring such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.
*   **Disputable Presumption:** Illnesses not in Section 32-A are presumed work-related, but seafarer must provide substantial evidence connecting work conditions to the illness. *See Leonis Navigation Co., Inc., et al. v. Heirs of the late Catalino V. Villamater, et al., 628 Phil. 81 (2010).*
*   **Compensability Test:** Not required that employment be the sole factor, only a contributing factor, even in a small degree. *CF. Sharp Crew Management, Inc. v. Legal Heirs of the Late Godofredo Repiso, 780 Phil. 645, 671 (2016).* Employer assumes the risk of employee infirmities, *Seagull Shipmanagement and Transport, Inc., et al. v. NLRC, et al. 388 Phil. 906, 914 (2000).*
*   **Colorectal Cancer & Risk Factors:** *Leonis Navigation Co., Inc., et al. v. Heirs of the late Catalino V. Villamater, et al.* recognized the link between high-fat diets (common on ships) and colorectal cancer risk.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Causation:** Establishing causation between work conditions (diet, strenuous labor) and the cancer development is a key contentious area. The Court relied on probability rather than certainty.
*   **Pre-Existing Condition:** The document indicates that even if the condition pre-existed employment, the work aggravated it, making it compensable. This could be contentious if the employer can prove a significant pre-existing condition.
*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** The Court favored Lagne's doctor over the company doctor, highlighting the lack of a formal, binding medical assessment by a panel of doctors as typically provided for in standard employment contracts.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **POEA Standard Employment Contract for Seafarers (POEA-SEC):** Primary contract governing the seafarer's employment. Specifically sections on disability benefits (20(B)), work-relatedness, and sickness allowance.
*   **Article XIII, 1987 Philippine Constitution:** Mandates full protection to labor.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The extent to which pre-existing conditions are compensable remains somewhat ambiguous. The court emphasizes that work must contribute to the development, even in a small degree, but lacks a clear metric for assessing this contribution.
