**Case Summary: *Office of the Court Administrator vs. Judge Walerico B. Butalid***

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative cases against RTC Judge Walerico B. Butalid for (1) gross misconduct, negligence, and inefficiency due to failure to decide 96 cases within the 90-day period (violations of Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution, Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and Section 67 of the Judiciary Act of 1948) and (2) falsification of Certificates of Service.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Failure to Decide Cases:** The Court found that Judge Butalid failed to decide 96 cases within the constitutionally mandated 90-day period. His defenses (incomplete transcripts, illness) were deemed insufficient.
*   **Falsification of Certificates of Service:** Judge Butalid falsely certified that he had no cases pending beyond the 90-day period in his Certificates of Service from July 1994 to December 1995.
*   **Consolidation**: A.M. No. RTJ-96-1337 and A.M. No. 96-10-372-RTC be CONSOLIDATED with A.M. No. 97-8-242-RTC
*   **OCA Recommendation**: Dismissal

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Duty to decide cases promptly as mandated by the Constitution and the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   Duty to provide truthful Certificates of Service.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for gross negligence, inefficiency, and dishonesty.
*   Potential criminal liability for falsification of public documents.

**Penalties:**

*   Dismissal from service.
*   Forfeiture of retirement benefits and leave credits.
*   Disqualification from re-employment in government service.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution:** Mandates timely resolution of cases.
*   **Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Requires judges to decide cases promptly.
*   **Section 67 of the Judiciary Act of 1948:** Pertains to inefficiency
*   **Uy vs. Mercado, 154 SCRA 567**: held that a formal investigation is unnecessary if records provide basis for determination of judge's administrative liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Respondent judge argues that most of the undecided cases were inherited from former judges. However, he did not identify said inherited cases in the list of cases for which he requested for the Supreme Court for the three (3) months extension to decide.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Dismissal:** While the Court's power to discipline is well-established, Judge Butalid could potentially challenge the dismissal based on due process grounds, arguing insufficient consideration of mitigating factors (illness). However, his admission of guilt and lack of objection to the recommended fine significantly weakens any such challenge.

**Concise Legal Summary:**

Judge Butalid was dismissed due to a pervasive pattern of failing to decide cases within the prescribed period and falsifying official documents to conceal this dereliction of duty. The Court found his conduct violative of the Constitution, the Code of Judicial Conduct, and general principles of judicial integrity, warranting the penalty of dismissal. His offer to accept a fine in exchange for optional retirement was rejected as it was deemed insufficient given the gravity of his offenses.
