Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *People v. Obero*, G.R. No. 169878:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Jesus Obero* G.R. No. 169878 (July 7, 2009)

**Facts:** This is a review on appeal of the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Jesus Obero for two counts of rape of a minor (AAA). Obero was charged with eight counts of rape, consolidated and tried jointly. He pleaded not guilty. The RTC convicted him on two counts relating to incidents in September 1996. The CA affirmed the conviction with modifications regarding damages.

**Issue:** Whether the accused-appellant's guilt for two counts of rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

**Holding:** Appeal dismissed due to the CA judgment having become final and executory. The Supreme Court also found no compelling reason to disturb the lower court rulings.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction for Rape:** Accused-appellant was convicted of two counts of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by RA 7659).
*   **Penalty:**  Sentenced to *Reclusion Perpetua* for each count of rape.
*   **Damages:** Ordered to pay the victim AAA Php 50,000.00 in moral damages and Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity for each count of rape.
*   **Finality of Judgement:** Due to accused-appellant counsel's error in handling appeal, the decision became final and executory.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for two counts of rape.
*   Civil liability for moral damages and civil indemnity.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Counsel's Malpractice:** The primary legal risk seems to stem from the counsel's negligence (Atty. Saladero) in handling the appeal, resulting in the judgment becoming final and precluding further judicial review on the merits. This raises the question of potential malpractice claims against the attorney.
*   **Immutability of Judgements:** Once a judgement becomes final and executory, it is no longer able to be altered based on an erroneous conclusion of fact or law.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A:** Defines and penalizes rape (prior to amendments).
*   **Republic Act (RA) No. 7659:** Amends the Revised Penal Code and increases penalties for certain crimes, including rape.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Discrepancy in Dates:** The accused-appellant raised concerns about the discrepancy between the dates of the alleged rapes in the sworn complaint (October-November 1996) and the Informations (September 1996). This could have been a viable defense had the appeal not been procedurally barred.
*   **Credibility of Witness (AAA):** The accused-appellant challenged the credibility of the victim's testimony, alleging inconsistencies, improbabilities, and a lack of understanding of the oath. Again, these arguments were not addressed on the merits due to the procedural issues.

**Legal Strategy Considerations (Hypothetical, Pre-Finality):**

*   Before the judgement became final, a strong appeal would have focused on the discrepancy in dates and the credibility of the victim's testimony. The defense could have argued that the inconsistencies raised reasonable doubt, potentially leading to an acquittal or a new trial.
*   If an actual error had been committed by the counsel in the handling of the appeal, a post-conviction relief could have been sought.
