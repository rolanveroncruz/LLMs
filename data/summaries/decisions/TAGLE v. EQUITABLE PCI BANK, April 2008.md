**Case Summary: Tagle v. Equitable PCI Bank, G.R. No. 172299, April 22, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 assailing the CA's dismissal of a prior Certiorari petition (CA-G.R. SP No. 90461) which challenged the RTC's denial of Tagle's Motion to Stop Writ of Possession.

**Facts:**

*   Alfredo Tagle (Tagle) challenges the foreclosure of property registered in his name (TCT No. T-143715) by Equitable PCI Bank (E-PCI). Tagle argues the property is a family home and exempt from foreclosure under the Family Code.
*   E-PCI contends the property was mortgaged via a Special Power of Attorney granted by Tagle to secure the obligation of Josefino and Emma Tagle. Upon default, E-PCI foreclosed, consolidated title, and sought a Writ of Possession in LRC Case No. P-71-2004.
*   Tagle filed a Motion to Stop Writ of Possession, claiming family home exemption. The RTC denied the motion.
*   Tagle filed a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 90461), which was dismissed for failure to attach required documents (the RTC Order denying his Motion to Stop Writ of Possession and the Motion to Stop Writ of Possession itself).
*   Tagle filed two Motions for Reconsideration, both denied by the CA.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Family Home Exemption (Article 155, Family Code):** Tagle argues the property is a family home and exempt from execution/foreclosure. E-PCI argues the mortgage predates the constitution of the family home or falls under exceptions in Article 155.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari (Rule 65, Rules of Court):** The Supreme Court (SC) focuses on whether Certiorari is the correct remedy. Certiorari is proper only for errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion. The SC notes the CA's dismissal was a final order appealable via Petition for Review on Certiorari (Rule 45).
*   **Failure to Attach Documents (Rule 65, Sec. 1 in relation to Rule 46, Sec. 3, Rules of Court):** The CA dismissed Tagle's original Certiorari petition for failing to attach required documents. The SC upholds this ruling, noting strict compliance is necessary.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal (Rule 45, Sec. 2, Rules of Court):** Tagle's petition was filed out of time. The 15-day period to appeal ran from the denial of the first Motion for Reconsideration, not the second (which is prohibited under Rule 37, Sec. 5).

**Ruling:**

The SC dismissed Tagle's Petition for Certiorari. The Court held that Certiorari was not the proper remedy as a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 was available. The Court also upheld the CA's dismissal of the original Certiorari petition for failure to comply with procedural requirements (attaching required documents). Finally, the SC noted the appeal was filed out of time.

**Potential Risks and Liabilities:**

*   **Loss of Property:** Tagle risks losing the property to E-PCI due to the foreclosure.
*   **Procedural Default:** Tagle's failure to follow procedural rules (wrong remedy, late filing) contributed to the dismissal of his case.
*   **Collateral Estoppel:** Issues litigated and decided (propriety of the remedy, procedural defects) are now binding on Tagle.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Special Power of Attorney:** The document is referenced but not fully analyzed. Its validity is crucial to the validity of the mortgage.
*   **Timing of Family Home Constitution:** While the court refers to Article 155 of the Family Code, there is a potential argument about whether or not the Family Home was constituted *before* the mortgage.  While the RTC implied the mortgage happened after, a detailed examination of the documents is required to verify.
*   **Whether Alfredo was bound by Josefino's actions**: The court discusses that Josefino was the one who obtained the mortgage, and whether he was authorized to do so, and if Alfredo was liable is not clearly explored.

**Advice:** This case highlights the critical importance of adhering to procedural rules and choosing the correct legal remedy. Tagleâ€™s failure to do so proved fatal to his case. The focus must shift to examining any potential remedies outside of the court system. The timing of events, and whether the mortgage by Josefino was authorized are critical to any further action.
