## Legal Document Summary: Apostol v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 141854 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging the CA decision affirming the RTC conviction of Petitioner Orlando Apostol for Theft under Articles 308 and 309 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Apostol was accused of Qualified Theft, conspiring with co-workers to steal from their employer Avelina Floro Cabrera. The Information specifies the stolen items and their value.
*   **Trial in Absentia:** After pleading not guilty, Apostol failed to attend subsequent hearings. The RTC deemed him to have waived his right to present evidence.
*   **RTC Decision:** Found Apostol guilty of Theft and sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 12 years of *Prision Mayor* to 20 years of *Reclusion Temporal*, plus indemnification. Co-accused America Floro was acquitted.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Filed after Apostol's arrest four years after the decision. Argued violation of due process due to lack of notice. Denied by RTC.
*   **CA Decision:** Dismissed Apostol's petition for certiorari, holding that his constitutional rights were not violated as his non-appearance implied intent to jump bail, citing *People v. Valeriano, G.R. Nos. 103604-05, September 23, 1993, 226 SCRA 694*.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Denied the Petition. Held that certiorari was not a substitute for a lost appeal. The SC held that the negligence of counsel binds the client, and Apostol was also negligent in not monitoring his case.

**Obligations:**

*   Apostol had the obligation to attend trial after pleading not guilty.
*   Apostol had the obligation to inform the court and his lawyer regarding the change of address.
*   Apostol was obligated to indemnify Avelina Floro for the stolen amount should his appeal succeed.

**Liabilities:**

*   Apostol was found liable for theft and sentenced to imprisonment.
*   Apostol was liable to pay indemnity to Avelina Floro in the amount of US $1,700.00, or its equivalent in pesos, and P34,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Due Process Violation Claim:** Apostol argued that his right to due process was violated due to lack of notice and the negligence of his counsel. This was the central argument for certiorari, but the court ruled against him finding that the negligence of the counsel binds the client.
*   **Validity of Arrest:** Apostol raised questions regarding the legality of his arrest, claiming it was warrantless and did not fall under the exceptions in Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure (old rules).
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** Apostol challenged the admissibility of the prosecution's evidence, arguing that it was hearsay and that his co-accused (Floro) was coached. He cited his co-accused being of unsound mind as a basis for this argument.
*   **Ineffective Counsel Claim:** Ineffective assistance of counsel due to the counsel's negligence.
*   **Trial In Absentia:** The validity of conducting trial in absentia and the sufficiency of notice to Apostol were key issues. The court ruled against him, concluding that the burden of proof lies on the defendant.
*   **Certiorari as Improper Remedy:** The court held that certiorari cannot be used as a substitute for a lost or lapsed remedy of appeal. The decision of the lower courts had already become final and executory.
*   The case relied on the previous *People v. Valeriano, G.R. Nos. 103604-05, September 23, 1993, 226 SCRA 694* which relates to the duties and obligations of the accused in a criminal case.
