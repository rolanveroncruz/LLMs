**Case Summary: *People v. Rosas*, G.R. No. 177825 (2008)**

**Subject:** Appeal of conviction for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Accused Rene Rosas charged with Murder for the death of Nestor Estacio on September 15, 1995, committed with treachery, armed with a gun, with intent to kill.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** RTC found Rosas guilty of murder, qualified by treachery, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. Awarded damages to Estacio's heirs.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction. Deleted actual damages award, granting temperate damages of P25,000.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision. Guilt beyond reasonable doubt established.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Rene Rosas is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Rosas is liable to pay the heirs of Nestor Estacio:
    *   P50,000 as civil indemnity
    *   P50,000 as moral damages
    *   P25,000 as exemplary damages
    *   P25,000 as temperate damages

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** Accused-appellant argued that the information failed to state that treachery was a qualifying circumstance. The SC ruled that the Information sufficiently alleged treachery, attack from behind and several more shots to the victim once on the ground.
*   **Alibi Defense:** Accused-appellant raised alibi, placing him at his boarding house during the crime. The Court refuted this defense as the distance between the boarding house and crime scene was negligible, and considering the positive identification by witnesses.
*   **Inconsistencies in Witness Testimony:** Accused-appellant argued that the testimonies of Wilfredo Bataga and Antonio Palomar Bataga, Jr., were inconsistent. The Court held that these inconsistencies were minor and did not undermine the credibility of their positive identifications.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87, July 4, 2004):** This case modified the rules on direct appeals to the Supreme Court in cases involving *reclusion perpetua*, life imprisonment, or death sentences, mandating initial review by the Court of Appeals.
*   **People v. Sayaboc (G.R. No. 147201, January 15, 2004) and People v. Aquino (G.R. Nos. 144340-42, August 6, 2002):** These cases reiterate that qualifying circumstances in an information do not need to be preceded by specific descriptive words like "qualifying" or "qualified by".
*   **People v. Lacbayan, (G.R. No. 125006, August 31, 2000)** perfect narration from a witness can lead to testimonies being fabricated.
*   **People v. Abrazaldo, (G.R. No. 124392, February 6, 2003):** Establishes that if actual damages for funeral expenses are unsubstantiated, temperate damages can be awarded in the amount of P25,000.00.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines Murder and prescribes the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* to death.
*   **Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Pertains to the designation of the offense in the information.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Issues:**

*   The main contention revolved around the sufficiency of the information regarding the allegation of treachery. However, the Supreme Court clarified that the specific manner of commission was adequately pleaded.
