**Case Summary: ABD Overseas Manpower Corp. vs. NLRC, Mars International Manpower, Inc., and Mohmina Macaraya (G.R. No. 117056, February 24, 1998)**

**Core Issue:** Whether a transferee recruitment agency (ABD) can be held jointly and severally liable for the illegal dismissal and salary underpayment of an overseas worker (Macaraya) when the cause of action arose and the case was filed against the original recruitment agency (MARS) prior to the transfer of accreditation.

**Facts:**

*   Macaraya was recruited by MARS and deployed as a domestic helper in Saudi Arabia, despite a contract indicating employment as a dressmaker with a higher salary.
*   She was illegally dismissed after 3 months and 13 days.
*   Macaraya filed a complaint with the POEA against MARS, the foreign employer, and Times Surety.
*   MARS filed an answer.
*   Subsequently, MARS moved to implead ABD, the transferee recruitment agency, arguing that ABD became the accredited agency for the foreign principal after the complaint was filed.
*   POEA ruled in favor of Macaraya, holding ABD and the foreign principal jointly and severally liable based on Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules (transfer of accreditation provision). POEA dismissed the cross-claim against MARS.
*   NLRC affirmed the POEA decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules:**  This is the central provision. It states that a transferee agency "shall assume full and complete responsibility for all contractual obligations of the principals to its workers originally recruited and processed by the former agency."  The court finds this rule may result in grave injustice to the petitioner.
*   **Recruitment Fee:** Macaraya paid MARS a recruitment fee of P12,000.
*   **Employment Contract:** Two-year employment contract with Mars, which was switched without Macaraya's knowledge.
*   **Art. 1236, Civil Code:** Whoever pays for another may demand from the debtor what he has paid

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **ABD's Liability:** The POEA and NLRC held ABD jointly and severally liable for US$4,113.39 in unpaid salaries and US$686.71 (less SR700) in salary differentials. The Court ultimately holds that ABD is liable to Macaraya in the first instance, but has a right to be reimbursed by MARS.
*   **MARS's Liability:** While the lower tribunals dismissed the claims against MARS, the Supreme Court determined that Mars should ultimately bear the financial burden, given that the issues of illegal dismissal occured at the time they had the contract with Macaraya.
*   **Risk of Strict Application of POEA Rule:** The Supreme Court acknowledged the potential for unjust enrichment and inequitable outcomes if Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules is applied inflexibly. This is a significant risk, as it could expose transferee agencies to liabilities arising from actions of the previous agency before the transfer.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 14, Article VIII of the Constitution:**  Requires court decisions to clearly state the facts and law on which they are based.  Cited to criticize the NLRC's inadequate explanation of its reasoning. *Nicos Industrial Corporation v. Court of Appeals*, 206 SCRA 127 (1992) also touches on this point, highlighting the need for due process and clear justification in judicial decisions.
*   ***Francisco v. Permskul*, 173 SCRA 324 (1989):** Discusses memorandum decisions, but emphasizes the need for appellate judges to articulate their own interpretation of the law.
*   **Rule 18 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:** Pertains to declaring default when a party fails to respond to a claim or crossclaim; MARS failed to answer the cross-claim by ABD. Note this provision is no longer found in the 1997 ROC.
*   **Sec. 9, Rule II, Book VI of the POEA Rules:** Technicalities of law do not strictly apply.
*   **Art. 10, Civil Code:** POEA is presumed to have intended right and justice to prevail.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Full and complete responsibility":** The phrase in Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules is interpreted restrictively to avoid unjust enrichment. The court interprets this to mean "stepping into the shoes" of the company for forward-looking events only.

**Legal Strategy Notes:**

*   **Arguments Against Transferee Liability:** This case provides precedent for arguing against automatic transferee liability under Section 6, Rule I, Book III of the POEA Rules, particularly when the cause of action accrued before the transfer and the original agency already participated in the proceedings.
*   **Unjust Enrichment Defense:**  The argument of unjust enrichment can be a powerful tool to challenge liability for pre-existing obligations of the transferor.
*   **Procedural Irregularities:** This case highlights the importance of addressing any procedural irregularities, such as failure to answer cross-claims, as grounds for appeal.
*   **Due Process for Prior Agency:** The Supreme Court emphasized that the POEA has a duty to resolve cases expeditiously; delays in its case proceedings contributed to the situation.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the NLRC resolutions but modified the outcome. ABD must pay Macaraya, but MARS must reimburse ABD. This decision underscores that while the transferee agency assumes responsibility under POEA rules, such responsibility is not absolute and will not be enforced if it leads to manifest injustice or unjust enrichment. The decision highlights the need for a nuanced application of POEA rules, considering the equities of the case.
