## Legal Document Summary: *Polintan v. People*, G.R. No. 161827

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on *certiorari* under Rule 45 challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of Sesinando Polintan's appeal due to failure to file the appellant's brief on time. The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction of Polintan for two counts of violation of Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (B.P. 22), the Bouncing Checks Law. The Supreme Court denied the petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22:** Polintan was convicted under this statute for issuing City Trust Banking Corporation checks (Check Nos. 441615 and 618149) drawn against insufficient funds (DAIF). The prosecution successfully proved the elements of the offense, including issuance of the checks, presentment for payment, dishonor due to DAIF, and notice of dishonor.
*   **Rule 124, Section 8, Rules of Court:** This provision governs the dismissal of appeals for failure to file the appellant's brief.  It states that the Court of Appeals may *motu proprio* (on its own motion) and with notice to the appellant, dismiss the appeal if the appellant fails to file his brief within the prescribed time, unless represented by counsel *de oficio*.
*   **Filing Deadlines & Extensions:** Polintan was granted multiple extensions of time to file his appellant's brief by the Court of Appeals, totaling 75 days from March 30, 2003 to June 13, 2003. He failed to meet this final deadline.
*   **Obligation to Prosecute Appeal Diligently:**  Appellants have an obligation to diligently prosecute their appeal and comply with the procedural rules. Failure to do so can result in dismissal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability under B.P. 22:**  The RTC found Polintan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating B.P. 22 based on the prosecution's evidence which was considered "air tight and conclusive."
*   **Consequences of Counsel's Negligence:** The Supreme Court reiterated the principle that the negligence and mistakes of counsel are binding on the client, citing *Sapad v. Court of Appeals*, 401 Phil. 478, 483 (2000). Polintan was held responsible for his counsel's failure to file the brief on time, despite assertions of internal office oversight.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Right to Appeal:** This case confirms the risk of losing the right to appeal due to procedural lapses, particularly the failure to file briefs within the prescribed timeframe. The Court emphasized that the right to appeal is a statutory privilege, not a natural right, and is subject to strict compliance with the Rules of Court, citing *Spouses Ortiz v. Court of Appeals*, 360 Phil. 95, 100-101 (1998).
*   **Binding Effect of Counsel's Actions:** Litigants are bound by the actions and omissions of their chosen counsel, even if those actions constitute negligence.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 22 (B.P. 22):** The Bouncing Checks Law - the substantive offense.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:**  Petition for Review on *Certiorari* to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 124, Section 8, Rules of Court:**  Dismissal of appeal for failure to file brief.
*   ***Spouses Ortiz v. Court of Appeals*, 360 Phil. 95, 100-101 (1998):**  Reinforces the principle that right to appeal is a statutory privilege and not a natural right.
*   ***Sapad v. Court of Appeals*, 401 Phil. 478, 483 (2000):**  Reiterates the principle that the negligence and mistakes of counsel are binding on the client.
*   ***Trans International v. CA*, 348 Phil. 830, 837 (1998):** Emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with the Rules of Court for orderly justice.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious point is the justification for the failure to file the appellant's brief. Polintan's counsel claimed an internal office error as the cause, which the CA deemed insufficient, especially considering the proximity of the law firm to the court. This highlights a potential area for factual dispute and demonstrates the court's reluctance to excuse procedural lapses based on internal office management issues.

**Overall Assessment:** The case underscores the importance of adhering to procedural rules, particularly deadlines for filing briefs, and reinforces the principle that clients are bound by the actions of their legal counsel. It presents a cautionary tale regarding the consequences of negligence and the limitations of appeals based on claims of internal office errors.
