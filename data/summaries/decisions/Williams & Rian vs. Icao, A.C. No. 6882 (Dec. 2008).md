## Legal Document Summary: *Williams v. Icao* (A.C. No. 6882)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case against Atty. Rodrigo Icao for violation of the Notarial Law and unlawful conduct.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Notarization without Presence:** Respondent admitted to notarizing a "Declaration of Heirship and Partition" without the signatories being present at the time of notarization.
*   **False Statements in Document:** The document contained several inaccuracies, including:
    *   Listing a lawyer (Atty. Enriquez) as an heir.
    *   Inconsistencies regarding the date of death of the subject individual.
    *   Discrepancies regarding the relationship of signatories to the deceased.
    *   Failure to record the residence certificate of one of the signatories, Lucia Briones.
*   **Defense of Prescription Rejected:** The Court reaffirmed that administrative proceedings against lawyers are not subject to prescription, citing *Frias v. Bautista-Lozada* (A.C. No. 6656) and *Heck v. Santos* (467 Phil. 798).
*   **Sanction:** Atty. Icao was suspended from the practice of law and his notarial commission for one year.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Duty to Inform:** Respondent failed his duty to inform himself of the facts before notarizing and to ensure accuracy of the document. *Pañganiban v. Borromeo* (58 Phil. 367) cited.
*   **Duty of Presence:** Respondent violated his duty to demand that signatures be affixed in his presence. *Traya, Jr. v. Villamor* (466 Phil. 919) cited.
*   **Compliance with Notarial Law:** Respondent failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Notarial Law (then effective, Revised Administrative Code) by not recording the residence certificate information. *Soriano v. Basco* (A.C. No. 6648) cited.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Privity to Preparation:** Respondent argued he was not privy to the document's preparation. The Court implicitly rejected this as a sufficient defense, reinforcing the duty of a notary to ascertain the facts before notarizing.
*   **Reliance on Joint Affidavit:** The Court viewed the Joint Affidavit submitted by the respondent not as exculpatory but as highlighting the inconsistencies within the original "Declaration."
*   **Complicity in Falsification Charge:** While not explicitly proven, the Court notes the document contained falsehoods and implies that the respondent had a duty to identify these falsehoods before notarizing. Atty Enriquez had been suspended for similar activity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Administrative Code (Section 249):** Regarding recording of residence certificate.
*   **Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the IBP (Rule VIII, Section 1):** Declared *ultra vires* to the extent it provides for prescription in administrative cases against lawyers.
*   ***Frias v. Bautista-Lozada* (A.C. No. 6656):** Established that administrative complaints against lawyers do not prescribe.
*   ***Heck v. Santos* (467 Phil. 798):**  Reinforces the lack of prescription in disciplinary cases against lawyers.
*   ***Calo v. Degamo* (126 Phil. 802):** Cited re: non-applicability of prescription to disbarment proceedings.
*   ***Soriano v. Basco* (A.C. No. 6648):** Highlights the mandatory nature of compliance with Notarial Law.

*   ***Pañganiban v. Borromeo* (58 Phil. 367):** Highlights the duty to inform before notarizing.

**Overall Assessment:**

The decision emphasizes the stringent duties and responsibilities of notaries public. Failure to properly verify information and adhere to procedural requirements can result in significant penalties, regardless of claimed lack of involvement in the document's creation. The case confirms that administrative actions against lawyers can be filed at any time as such cases don't prescribe. The Supreme Court emphasizes that notarization is not merely ministerial, but an act invested with public interest and requiring utmost care.
