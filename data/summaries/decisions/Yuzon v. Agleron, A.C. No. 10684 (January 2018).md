## Legal Document Summary: *Yuzon v. Agleron*, A.C. No. 10684

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Arnulfo M. Agleron for misappropriation of client funds.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Fiduciary Duty:** The court emphasizes the fiduciary duty of a lawyer to a client, requiring honesty and good faith.
*   **Canon 16, Rules 16.01 & 16.03, CPR:** Atty. Agleron violated these rules by failing to account for and return funds received from his client, Iluminada Yuzon.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Basis for suspension due to "gross misconduct" arising from misappropriation of funds.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Return of Funds:** Atty. Agleron is ordered to return P582,000.00 to Yuzon.
*   **Interest:** 12% interest from date of demand until June 30, 2013; 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment (referencing *Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013) for interest calculation).
*   **Suspension:** Suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year, effective immediately.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Disbarment (Future):** Repetition of similar misconduct could lead to disbarment.
*   **Enforcement:** Yuzon will need to enforce the monetary judgment through execution proceedings.
*   **Levy Insufficiency:** Atty. Agleron's claim of overpayment due to levy on his property is premature until the property is sold and the proceeds are realized, highlighting the need for a successful execution sale.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Disbarment or Suspension of Attorneys
*   **Canon 16, Rules 16.01 & 16.03, CPR:** Client funds management.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames*, 716 Phil. 267 (2013):** Calculation of interest.
*   ***Punla v. Maravilla-Ona*, A.C. No. 11149:** Misappropriation is a violation of trust.
*   ***Egger v. Duran*, A.C. No. 11323:** Misconduct a violation of morality and professional ethics.
*   ***Dagooc v. Erlina*, 493 Phil. 563:** Definition of levy.
*   Other citations are used as precedential support for the fiduciary duty owed by a lawyer to his client.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Justification for Misappropriation:** Atty. Agleron's explanation of borrowing the funds for a client's emergency is not an acceptable defense to the violation of fiduciary duty.
*   **Effectivity of Suspension:** The Court clarifies that the suspension takes effect with this ruling, rejecting the argument that it already occurred during the IBP's initial notice.
*   **Levy as Satisfaction:** Respondent's argument that the property levy constituted overpayment is rejected as the claim is premature before execution of the sale.

**Overall Assessment:**

Atty. Agleron has been found guilty of gross misconduct for misappropriating client funds. The Court's decision reinforces the importance of a lawyer's fiduciary duty and the serious consequences of violating that duty. The order for the return of the misappropriated funds with interest underscores the need for attorneys to prioritize their client's interests above their own, or the interests of other clients.
