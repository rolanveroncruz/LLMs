## Legal Document Summary: *Rufina Fajardo, et al. v. Alberto Comandante, et al.* (G.R. No. 185396)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision dismissing a Petition for Certiorari imputing grave abuse of discretion on the RTC.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over a parcel of land allegedly fraudulently transferred via a forged deed of sale. The Fajardos (petitioners) sought to annul the deed and the resulting TCT in favor of Comandante (respondent).
*   **RTC Dismissal:** The RTC initially dismissed the Fajardos' complaint *without* prejudice for failure to prosecute. This was then amended to a dismissal *with* prejudice after Comandante filed a motion for reconsideration.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration (Comandante):** Comandante's motion, which prompted the dismissal with prejudice, was allegedly served late, violating the three-day notice rule (Rule 15, Section 4 of the Rules of Civil Procedure).
*   **Petitioners' Failure to Appeal:** The Fajardos did *not* file a motion for reconsideration or a notice of appeal within the prescribed period after the RTC dismissed the case with prejudice. Instead, they filed a belated "Motion to Treat Defendants' Motion...as a Mere Scrap of Paper."
*   **Final and Executory Order:** The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the RTC's dismissal with prejudice had become final and executory due to the Fajardos' failure to timely appeal.

**Obligations:**

*   **Plaintiffs (Fajardos):** Obligation to diligently prosecute their case, including timely setting it for pre-trial and responding to motions.
*   **Parties:** Obligation to comply with procedural rules, including the three-day notice rule for motions (Rule 15, Sec. 4).
*   **Adverse Party:** The Adverse party is responsible to comply with the mandated rules regarding the motion for the dismissal of the case.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Fajardos:** The Fajardos are essentially liable for their counsel's inaction and failure to diligently pursue their claim, resulting in the dismissal with prejudice. They bear the cost of the failed legal challenge.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of Judgments:** Highlights the risk of failing to appeal final orders within the prescribed period, rendering them unassailable even if based on potentially erroneous legal conclusions. See *Temic Semiconductors, Inc. Employees Union v. Federation of Free Workers*, *Bearneza v. National Labor Relations Commission*, *Gallardo-Corro v. Gallardo*.
*   **Collateral Attacks:** Demonstrates the inadmissibility of collateral attacks on final and executory judgments. See *Filinvest Credit Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court*.
*   **Effect of procedural lapses:** Failure to comply with the rule on three-day notice (Rule 15, Sec. 4) may lead to dismissal of the case,
*   **Dismissal for failure to prosecute (Rule 17, Sec. 3):** Plaintiff risk dismissal of the case for failure to prosecute case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 15, Section 4, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** Three-day notice rule for motions.  This rule is central to the petitioner's argument regarding the validity of Comandante's motion.
*   **Rule 17, Section 3, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:** Dismissal of case for the failure to prosecute.
*   **Rule 41, Section 2. Modes of appeal:** Failure to comply with the provision bars the parties from recourse.
*   **A.M. No. 03-1-09-SC, Proposed Rule on Guidelines to be Observed by Trial Court Judges and Clerks of Court in the Conduct of Pre-Trial and Use of Deposition-Discovery Measures:** Duty of the branch clerk of court to issue a notice of pre-trial.
*   **Vios v. Pantangco, Jr., G.R. No. 163103, February 6, 2009; Heirs of Placido Miranda v. Court of Appeals:** Special civil action of certiorari cannot be a substitute for a lost appeal.
*   **Temic Semiconductors, Inc. Employees Union v. Federation of Free Workers, G.R. No. 160993, May 20, 2008; Bearneza v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 146930, September 11, 2006; Gallardo-Corro v. Gallardo:** Judgement that are final and executory can no longer be modified
*   **Filinvest Credit Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 66641, March 6, 1992:** Final and executory judgements cannot be collaterally attacked.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary point of contention revolves around the alleged defective notice for Comandante's Motion for Reconsideration and whether the RTC erred in acting upon it. The court acknowledges the defect but emphasizes the Fajardos' subsequent inaction as fatal to their case.
*   The delay on the RTC side to act upon Alberto's motion for reconsideration is a potential area of contention, however, the Fajardos failed to act within the period of such delay.
