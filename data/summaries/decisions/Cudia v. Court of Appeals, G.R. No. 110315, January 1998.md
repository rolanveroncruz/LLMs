## Legal Document Summary: *Cudia v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 110315 (1998)

**Subject:** Double Jeopardy Defense

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of a first information for illegal possession of firearms, filed by the City Prosecutor of Angeles City, bars a subsequent prosecution for the same offense by the Provincial Prosecutor of Pampanga.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that double jeopardy did not attach because the City Prosecutor lacked the authority to file the first information. Therefore, the dismissal of that information does not preclude the subsequent prosecution by the Provincial Prosecutor.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Facts:** Renato Cudia was arrested in Mabalacat, Pampanga for illegal possession of firearms. The City Prosecutor of Angeles City filed the first information (Crim. Case No. 11542).  The court noticed the crime occurred outside Angeles City. The Provincial Prosecutor of Pampanga then filed a second information (Crim. Case No. 11987). The first information was dismissed, despite Cudia's opposition, due to lack of jurisdiction.  Cudia moved to quash the second information, arguing double jeopardy.
*   **Double Jeopardy Requisites:** The Court restates the elements necessary to establish a double jeopardy defense: (1) first jeopardy attached; (2) first jeopardy validly terminated; (3) second jeopardy is for the same offense or a necessarily included offense.
*   **Jurisdiction:** While Branch 60 of the Angeles City RTC had territorial jurisdiction per Administrative Order No. 7, Series of 1983, jurisdiction is conferred by law, not administrative policy.
*   **Authority to File Information:** The *ratio decidendi* turns on the lack of authority of the City Prosecutor of Angeles City to file the first information for a crime committed outside his jurisdiction, specifically in Mabalacat, Pampanga. The Court cites Presidential Decree No. 1275 and Section 9 of the Administrative Code of 1987, which grants the power to investigate and prosecute offenses *within their respective jurisdictions* to the City and Provincial Fiscal.  The Pampanga Provincial Prosecutor was the proper prosecuting officer.
*   **Waiver Argument Rejected:**  The Court dismissed Cudia's argument that his failure to object to the City Prosecutor's authority constitutes a waiver. Lack of jurisdiction can be raised at any stage and cannot be cured by silence, acquiescence, or consent. Cites *Estrada vs. NLRC, 262 SCRA 709 (1996); Amigo vs. Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 382 (1996); De Leon vs. Court of Appeals, 245 SCRA 166 (1995); Lozon vs. NLRC, 240 SCRA 1 (1995).*
*   **Amendment Argument Rejected:** Although amendment of the first information could have been an option, dismissal and re-filing is a valid alternative under Section 14 of Rule 110, as referenced in *Galvez vs. Court of Appeals, 237 SCRA 685.*
*   **Government Not Estopped:** The Court invokes the principle that the State is not bound by the mistakes of its officials, citing *DBP vs. COA, 231 SCRA 202 (1994) citing Cruz, Jr. vs. CA, 194 SCRA 145 (1991)*.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Territorial Jurisdiction vs. Prosecutorial Authority:**  The decision conflates *territorial* jurisdiction of the court (Angeles City RTC) with *prosecutorial* jurisdiction (City vs. Provincial Prosecutor).  The court had territorial jurisdiction, but the City Prosecutor lacked the authority to act.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** This ruling may open the door to abuse if prosecutors deliberately file informations in the wrong jurisdiction to allow for a second attempt at prosecution should the first case falter.
*   **Lack of Specific Statutory Reference to Prosecutorial Authority:** The court's reliance on PD 1275 and the Administrative Code is somewhat general. A more specific statute or provision detailing the precise limits of a City Prosecutor's authority relative to a Provincial Prosecutor in overlapping geographical areas would strengthen the argument.
