## Legal Document Summary: *Sangguniang Barangay of Barangay Don Mariano Marcos v. Punong Barangay Severino Martinez*, G.R. No. 170626, March 3, 2008

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of a Sangguniang Bayan decision removing a Punong Barangay from office.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 60 of the Local Government Code (LGC) (RA 7160):** Grants exclusive power to the *courts* to remove elective local officials from office.
*   **Section 61 of the LGC:** Outlines the procedure for filing administrative complaints against erring elective barangay officials before the Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan.
*   **Invalidation of Article 125, Rule XIX of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the LGC:**  Declared invalid insofar as it grants a "disciplining authority" (like the Sangguniang Bayan) the power to remove elected officials, as this power is reserved for the courts under Section 60 of the LGC.
*   **Doctrine of Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** Generally requires parties to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief, but the Court held that Martinez's claim fell under the exception because the challenged administrative act was patently illegal and a legal question was at issue.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Sangguniang Bayan:** Obligated to follow the procedures for administrative complaints under Section 61 of the LGC, but *not* authorized to order removal from office. Their powers extend to suspension, but for removal the case must be filed with the Regional Trial Court.
*   **Punong Barangay (Martinez):** Subject to administrative complaints for dishonesty, misconduct, and violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. While the Sangguniang Bayan can investigate, it cannot remove him from office; that power resides solely with the courts.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:**  Potential for misinterpretation of Section 61, leading Sangguniang Bayans to believe they have removal power, as argued by the petitioner. This decision clarifies that while they handle complaints, their power to remove officials is curtailed.
*   **Risk:**  Political abuse of power if local legislative bodies could remove chief executives, as warned by the Supreme Court. The decision safeguards against capriciousness and partisanship.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Central statutory reference.
*   **Salalima v. Guingona, Jr., 326 Phil. 847 (1996):** Key precedent invalidating provisions granting disciplining authorities the power to remove elected officials.
*   **Pablico v. Villapando, 434 Phil. 853 (2002):** Reiterates *Salalima* and clarifies the exclusive judicial prerogative of removing elected officials.
*   **Castro v. Gloria, G.R. No. 132174, 20 August 2001, 363 SCRA 417:** Discusses exceptions to exhaustion of administrative remedies.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision, holding that the Sangguniang Bayan of Bayombong exceeded its jurisdiction when it ordered the removal of Punong Barangay Martinez from office. The power to remove elective local officials rests exclusively with the courts under Section 60 of the Local Government Code.  While the Sangguniang Bayan can investigate and suspend, it cannot order removal. The decision clarifies the interplay between Sections 60 and 61 of the LGC, resolving potential ambiguity. It also reaffirms *Salalima* and *Pablico* concerning the invalidity of administrative rules granting removal power to non-judicial bodies.
