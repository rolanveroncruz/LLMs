**Legal Document Summary: _Eagle Star Security Services, Inc. vs. Bonifacio L. Mirando_ (G.R. No. 179512, July 30, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Employee Status:** Bonifacio Mirando (Respondent) was a security guard employed by Eagle Star Security Services, Inc. (Petitioner).
*   **Termination:** Respondent alleges illegal dismissal on December 15, 2001. Petitioner claims the Respondent went AWOL.
*   **Conflicting Evidence:**  Petitioner submitted a memo dated December 26, 2001 alleging the Respondent said he would resign, and the Respondent provided sworn testimony showing he was terminated with no warning.
*   **Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA Rulings:**  All found illegal dismissal in favor of Mirando, ordering reinstatement and backwages. NLRC modified the Labor Arbiter's decision with changes in the monetary awards.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Petitioner argued that Respondent abandoned his job by going AWOL and that his complaint was premature, claiming he was merely on "floating status" per Article 286 of the Labor Code.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** To prove valid cause for dismissal, which they failed to do. The burden of proof lies on the employer.
*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Liable for backwages, reinstatement (or separation pay if reinstatement is not feasible), and attorney's fees for illegally dismissing the Respondent.
*   **Respondent's Obligation:** None specified, but implicitly, he must be willing and able to work if reinstatement is ordered.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petition Deficiency:** There is an issue with the authorization of Reynaldo Tauro to file the petition before the Supreme Court, rendering it potentially defective. _Fuentebella and Rolling Hills Memorial Park v. Castro_ (G.R. No. 15086, 494 SCRA 183 (2006)) addresses the need for a duly authorized director or representative to sign the certificate against forum shopping on behalf of a corporation.
*   **Liability for monetary award:** If the SC upholds the lower courts' decisions, the employer will be financially responsible for reinstating the employee and paying back wages and fees.
*   **Article 286 Misapplication:** Petitioner incorrectly applies Article 286 of the Labor Code (suspension of business operations) as the client bank continued to hire services and there was no indication of suspension of business. The Court cites _Philippine Industrial Security Agency v. Dapiton_ for clarification of its applicability.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Primarily relies on the interpretation and application of the provisions regarding illegal dismissal (though specific articles are not cited beyond Art. 286).
*   **Article 286 of the Labor Code:** Cited by petitioner regarding floating status or off-detail, but ultimately deemed inapplicable by the Court.
*   **_Fuentebella and Rolling Hills Memorial Park v. Castro_ (G.R. No. 15086, 494 SCRA 183 (2006))**: Addresses the necessity of proper authorization for the certification against forum shopping.
*    **_Philippine Industrial Security Agency v. Dapiton_ (G.R. No. 127421, December 8, 1999, 377 Phil. 951, 962)**: Clarifies that Article 286 applies to bona fide suspension of business, and temporary "off-detail" of guards is related to the security agency's client's lack of need for guards.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Voluntary Resignation vs. AWOL:** Disputed issue of fact as to whether the employee voluntarily resigned.
*   **Reasonableness of Delay:** Validity of detachment commander's delay to report SG Mirandos' alleged intimation that he was resigning.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court *denies* the petition, upholding the CA's decision. The Court finds no reversible error in the lower court's findings that the Respondent was illegally dismissed. The Petition did not provide proof Reynaldo G. Tauro was authorized to file the petition.
