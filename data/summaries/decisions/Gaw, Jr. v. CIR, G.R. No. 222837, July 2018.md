## Legal Document Summary: *Macario Lim Gaw, Jr. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, G.R. No. 222837, July 23, 2018

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CTA En Banc's decision affirming the dismissal of a Petition for Review Ad Cautelam (CTA Case No. 8503) for non-payment of docket fees. The underlying dispute concerns the characterization of real property sold by the Petitioner (Lim Gaw, Jr.) and the consequent tax liability (capital gains vs. ordinary income/VAT).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Sale of Land:** Petitioner sold 10 parcels of land to Eagle I Landholdings, Inc. in 2008.
*   **Tax Assessment:** Petitioner initially paid Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) based on BIR computations.
*   **Revised Assessment:** The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) subsequently assessed deficiency income tax and VAT, arguing the properties were *ordinary assets* (subject to regular income tax/VAT) rather than *capital assets* (subject to CGT).
*   **Criminal Charges:** The CIR filed criminal charges against Petitioner for tax evasion under Sections 254 and 255 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).
*   **Final Decision on Disputed Assessment (FDDA):** The CIR issued an FDDA assessing deficiency taxes for 2007 and 2008.
*   **CTA Filings:** Petitioner filed a Petition for Review with the CTA regarding the 2007 assessment (CTA Case No. 8502) and paid the corresponding fees.  For the 2008 assessment, he filed a Petition for Review *Ad Cautelam* (CTA Case No. 8503), citing the ongoing criminal case where civil liabilities for tax and penalties were deemed instituted.  The CTA clerk initially assessed "zero filing fees" on this petition.
*   **Acquittal & Civil Case:** Petitioner was acquitted in the criminal cases, and the CTA directed litigation of the civil aspect in CTA Case No. 8503.
*   **Motion to Dismiss:** CIR moved to dismiss the Petition for Review Ad Cautelam (CTA Case No. 8503) for lack of jurisdiction due to non-payment of filing fees.
*   **CTA Dismissal Upheld:** Both the CTA First Division and En Banc upheld the dismissal.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Whether the CTA erred in dismissing the Petition for Review Ad Cautelam for non-payment of docket fees. The petitioner argues the civil aspect was already deemed instituted with the criminal case, therefore no separate fee payment was required, relying on Rule 9, Section 11 of A.M. No. 05-11-07-CTA.
2.  **Classification of Assets:** Whether the sold properties were capital assets or ordinary assets, determining the applicable tax regime. Relevant NIRC provisions: Section 39(A)(1); Revenue Regulations No. 7-2003, Section 2(a) and (b).

**Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court **partially granted** the petition, finding the CTA En Banc erred in dismissing the case for non-payment of docket fees. The Court **reversed and set aside** the CTA En Banc Decision and **remanded** the case to the CTA First Division for further proceedings, including an assessment of the proper docket fees.

The Court held:

*   The Petition for Review Ad Cautelam is **NOT** deemed instituted with the criminal case. The civil liability arising from tax laws is distinct from the civil liability arising from the offense of tax evasion. Case law: *Republic of the Philippines v. Patanao* and *Proton Pilipinas Corp. v. Republic of the Phils.* support this argument.
*   However, the CTA should not have dismissed the case outright. It should have ordered the Clerk of Court to assess the correct docket fees and given Petitioner a reasonable opportunity to pay them.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Asset Classification:** The determination of whether the properties are capital or ordinary assets is a factual issue to be decided by the CTA. The CIR argues the land was "heldâ€¦ primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business" thus classifying it as an ordinary asset under Section 39(A)(1) of the NIRC.
*   **"Zero Filing Fee" Assessment:** The CTA clerk's initial "zero filing fee" assessment creates ambiguity and contributes to the Petitioner's argument of good faith reliance. This may be used to mitigate potential penalties if the property is classified as ordinary.
*   **Remand Complexity:** The remand to the CTA First Division could result in protracted litigation on factual issues regarding the nature of the assets.

*   *Calasanz, et al. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue*, 228 Phil. 638 (1986)

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioner's primary obligation is to pay the assessed taxes if the properties are deemed ordinary assets.
*   Petitioner is obligated to pay the assessed docket fees for CTA Case No. 8503 within ten days of receiving the corrected assessment.

**Recommendations:**

*   Focus on gathering evidence to support the argument that the land was a capital asset and not held primarily for sale.
*   Explore potential mitigation strategies, such as challenging the validity of the assessment process and the service of notices.
*   Prepare for a potentially lengthy legal battle in the CTA First Division.
