## Legal Document Summary: People v. Sullano, G.R. No. 228373 (2018)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari

**Issue:** Whether Section 15, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) requires apprehension or arrest for a person to be charged with use of dangerous drugs, specifically in the context of mandatory drug testing under Section 36, Article III of the same Act.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA and RTC rulings that granted the demurrer to evidence and dismissed the case against the respondent. The Court held that Section 15 requires apprehension or arrest for it to apply.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Section 15, Article II, RA 9165:** Penalizes a "person apprehended or arrested" found positive for drug use after a confirmatory test.
*   **Section 36, Article III, RA 9165:** Mandates random drug testing for police officers, with a general provision that positive results subject individuals to Section 15.
*   **Plain Meaning Rule:** The Court applied the plain meaning rule, stating the phrase "apprehended or arrested" qualifies "a person" in Section 15. It determined Section 15 is unambiguous, necessitating prior apprehension or arrest. *Verba legis non est recendendum.*
*   **Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius:** The express mention of "apprehended or arrested" excludes other scenarios, such as mandatory drug testing, from the scope of Section 15.
*   **Harmonization of Provisions:** The Court attempted to harmonize Section 36 and Section 15 suggesting that those found positive from a random drug test be subjected to 6 months of rehab as indicated in Sec 15.
*   **Information Defect:** The information charged the respondent solely under Section 15, failing to allege apprehension/arrest or reference Section 36. Convicting him based on a theory involving Section 36 would violate his right to be informed of the accusation against him.
*   **Strict Construction of Penal Laws:** *Nullum crimen poena sine lege* and *in dubiis reus est absolvendus* - Penal laws are construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused. Ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the accused.
*   **Dela Cruz v. People, 739 Phil. 578 (2014):** The Court cited this case to support its narrow interpretation of "apprehended or arrested," holding that it applies only to offenses listed under Article II of RA 9165 and not a catch-all for any crime. It also cited *Social Justice Society v. Dangerous Drugs Board, 591 Phil 393 (2008)* for its interpretation of mandatory drug testing.
*   **Double Jeopardy:** Granting the petition would expose the respondent to double jeopardy, as his acquittal was based on a valid demurrer absent grave abuse of discretion.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Inconsistent Application of Law:** The Courtâ€™s interpretation could lead to inconsistent application of drug laws, where individuals caught using drugs after arrest for other crimes face harsher penalties than those identified through random testing.
*   **Narrow Interpretation of Section 15:** The Court's narrow reading of Section 15 could potentially undermine the effectiveness of random drug testing programs by preventing criminal prosecution for drug use detected through these programs.
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Administrative Liability:** While dismissing criminal charges, the RTC suggested administrative liability for the respondent. This raises questions about the standard of proof and due process requirements for administrative proceedings in such cases. The document doesn't fully explore this aspect.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' dismissal of the case, emphasizing the need for strict adherence to the wording of penal laws. The decision highlights the importance of a proper information and the limitations of applying Section 15 in cases where the accused was not initially apprehended or arrested for a drug-related offense. The impact of the decision on the enforcement of drug testing programs, particularly within law enforcement agencies, remains a potential area for future consideration.
