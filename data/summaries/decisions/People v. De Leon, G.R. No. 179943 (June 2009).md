## Legal Document Summary: *People v. De Leon*

**Nature of the Document:** Philippine Supreme Court Decision (G.R. No. 179943, June 26, 2009) affirming with modification the Court of Appeals (CA) decision finding Marlon Albert De Leon guilty of robbery with homicide under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Conviction:** De Leon was convicted of robbery with homicide due to his participation in the robbery of a gasoline station during which a security guard was killed.
*   **Conspiracy:** The Court found that there was an implied conspiracy among De Leon and his co-accused, based on their coordinated actions during the robbery (armed robbery, theft of gas station cash and victim wallets, fatal shooting of a security guard), as detailed in prosecution witness testimonies.
*   **Single Offense:** The Court agreed with the Court of Appeals that the series of robberies at the gas station were one continuous crime resulting from the "single impulse" of robbery. Therefore, only one penalty is applicable.
*   **Penalty:** Originally sentenced to death by the RTC, the penalty was reduced to *reclusion perpetua* by the CA due to Republic Act No. 9346 (abolishing the death penalty). The Supreme Court affirmed this penalty, finding no mitigating or adequately proven aggravating circumstances.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance:** The prosecution alleged the use of an unlicensed firearm as an aggravating circumstance, per Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended by Republic Act No. 8294. However, the Supreme Court ruled that while the existence of the firearm could be proven by testimony (citing *People v. Dulay*), the prosecution failed to prove that De Leon lacked a license to possess the firearm. Thus, this aggravating circumstance was disregarded.
*  **Damages:** Moral damages and death indemnity were given. Temperate damages of 25,000 pesos was awarded in lieu of actual damages in light of the ruling from *People v. Abrazaldo*.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** De Leon is criminally liable as a principal for the crime of robbery with homicide under Article 294(1) RPC due to his involvement in the conspiracy.
*   **Civil Liability:** De Leon is obligated to pay the heirs of the deceased damages as ordered by the RTC.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Specificity in Information:** While the document does not explicitly state it, the case hints at the need for more specific information in charging documents to ensure proper notice to the accused.
*   **Proof of Lack of License:** The case highlights the importance of presenting affirmative evidence, such as records from licensing authorities, to prove the lack of a firearm license when alleging this as an aggravating circumstance. Mere testimony regarding the firearm's existence is insufficient.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 294(1), Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes robbery with homicide.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended by Republic Act No. 8294:** Addresses illegal possession and use of firearms and their impact on penalties for related crimes.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Abolished the death penalty in the Philippines, impacting De Leon's initial sentence.
*   ***People v. De Jesus*:** Lays out the elements of robbery with homicide.
*   ***People v. Dulay*:** Addresses proving the existence of the firearm through testimony.
*   ***People v. Abrazaldo*:** Sets the amount and the standard for temperate damages.
