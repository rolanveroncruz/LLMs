## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Angeles y Namil* (G.R. No. 218947, June 20, 2018)

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and acquitted accused-appellant Rey Angeles y Namil of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21.

**Key Provisions/Elements (Violation of Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165):**

*   **Elements of the offense:** Identity of buyer/seller, object (shabu), consideration (P500); delivery of object and payment. *People v. Almodiel, 694 Phil. 449, 460 (2012).*
*   **Crucial Issue:** The *corpus delicti* (the shabu) must be proven with unwavering exactitude.  *Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008)*. Requires unbroken chain of custody.

**Chain of Custody (Section 21, RA 9165):** The court reiterates the requirements of Section 21, including immediate inventory and photography of seized drugs in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official.

*   **(1) Seizure and Marking:** PO2 Saez testified he seized and marked the sachet.
*   **(2) Turnover to Investigating Officer:** PO2 Saez possessed the item during arrest and investigation.
*   **(3) Turnover to Forensic Chemist:** Problematic. PO2 Saez delivered to "Relos," a receiving clerk at PNP Crime Lab. No further information about Relos, handling procedures, or subsequent transfers before reaching the forensic chemist.
*   **(4) Turnover to Court:** Missing. No information on who brought the drugs to court.

**Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:**

*   **Prosecution's Claim:** "Urgency of the operation" and belief that representatives were only necessary for search warrants.
*   **Court's Rejection:**  The Court found the explanation of "urgency" vague and insufficient.  No evidence of attempts to contact representatives.  Erroneous belief about Section 21 application undermines the justification. *People v. Año, G.R. No. 230070, 14 March 2018.*
*   **Legal Principle:** Prosecutors have a *positive duty* to justify deviations from Section 21. *People v. Año, G.R. No. 230070, 14 March 2018.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   **Definition of "Urgency":** The degree of urgency required to excuse compliance with Section 21 is not well-defined, leading to inconsistent application.
*   **Role of Forensic Chemist Stipulation:** While qualifications were stipulated, the *handling* of evidence before and after chemist possession remained unaddressed. *People v. Gatlabayan, 669 Phil. 240, 258 (2011)*

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Evidence Suppression:** Failure to comply with Section 21 and demonstrate a proper chain of custody can result in evidence suppression and acquittal, even with a positive drug test.
*   **Civil Liability (Potential):** While the accused was acquitted, potential civil liability for illegal arrest and detention, while unlikely given the circumstances, should be considered depending on further facts.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Mallillin, 576 Phil. 576 (2008):* Stresses the importance of the chain of custody rule to ensure the integrity and identity of the seized drug.
*   *People v. Kamad, 624 Phil. 289 (2010):* Outlines the links in the chain of custody in buy-bust operations.
*   *People v. Año, G.R. No. 230070, 14 March 2018:* Emphasizes the prosecution's duty to justify deviations from Section 21.
*   *People v. Holgado, 741 Phil. 78 (2014):* Highlights the need for strict compliance, especially when the amount of drugs seized is minuscule.
