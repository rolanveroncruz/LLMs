Here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Domingo v. Revilla, Jr.*, A.C. No. 5473 (2018)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court addresses a disbarment complaint against Atty. Revilla, Jr., based on allegations of deceit and misrepresentation perpetrated on his client, Gene Domingo, regarding a legal matter (rescission of adoption and estate settlement).  Revilla misrepresented progress on the case, induced Domingo to remit funds under false pretenses, and made false claims about influencing judges.

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Rule 1.01, Canon 1 (Code of Professional Responsibility):** Dishonest and deceitful conduct. Revilla is found to have deliberately defrauded his client.
*   **Rules 15.06 & 15.07, Canon 15 (Code of Professional Responsibility):** Implying influence over public officials/tribunals and failing to impress upon the client compliance with the laws and principles of fairness. Revilla implied he could influence judges and requested money for "the boys" in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 18.03, Canon 18 (Code of Professional Responsibility):** Neglect of legal matter. Revilla neglected the matter entrusted to him.
*   The respondent, a lawyer, took money from the complainant, promised legal services, but did little to nothing.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Attorneys have a fiduciary duty to act with candor, fairness, and loyalty (Canon 15).
*   Attorneys must not neglect legal matters entrusted to them (Rule 18.03).
*   Attorneys must not engage in dishonest or deceitful conduct (Rule 1.01).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The respondent argued that he prepared some documents and offered a check as security, mitigating his misconduct; this was not given much weight by the court.
*   Amicable settlement was reached where Respondent fully reimbursed the victim the amount taken but the Supreme Court proceeded with the case.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court considered several mitigating factors including the respondent's candor at the start of the engagement, full restitution of the money received and the respondent's failing health and contributions to charity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Referenced *Que v. Revilla, Jr.*, A.C. No. 7054, which resulted in Revilla's disbarment.
*   Cites *Solidon v. Macalalad, A.C. No. 8158*, regarding the violation of Rule 18.03
*   Refers to *Rivera v. Corral, A.C. No. 3548* regarding the objectives of administrative cases against lawyers.

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   While the IBP initially recommended a reprimand, the Court found that the Respondent was more than negligent - he was deliberately defrauding his client.
*   The timing of filing the annulment case (after the demand letter) underscores bad faith.
*   The Court acknowledges Revilla's prior disbarment, preventing another disbarment as it is not allowed in the jurisdiction.
*   The Court acknowledges the mitigating factors but finds the respondent guilty due to his deceit.

**Outcome:**

*   Atty. Revilla is found guilty of violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
*   He is fined P100,000.00.
*   The fine is levied despite his pre-existing disbarment to assert the Court's disciplinary authority.
