**Case Summary: Dimayuga v. Rubia, A.C. No. 8854 (2018)**

**Nature of Action:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Vivian G. Rubia for gross negligence, misrepresentation, and violation of the lawyer's oath.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Delayed Transfer of Estate (2002):** Complainant alleges respondent failed to timely process the transfer of property from the deceased father's estate despite receiving funds for taxes and fees (Amended Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate with Waiver of Rights). Allegations of misappropriation of funds, however, were not substantially proven.
*   **Illegal Sale of CLOA Land (2003):** Respondent prepared and notarized a Deed of Absolute Sale for land covered by TCT No. CARP-03000 derived from CLOA No. 00394433, which contained a 10-year prohibition on sale under R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law). This constitutes a violation of Canon 1 and Rule 15.07 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 1, CPR:** Duty to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws, and promote respect for law.
*   **Rule 15.07, CPR:** Duty to impress upon the client compliance with laws and principles of fairness.
*   **Rules on Notarial Practice:** A notary public shall not perform any notarial act described in these Rules for any person requesting such an act even if he tenders the appropriate fee specified by these Rules if:
    (a) the notary knows or has good reason to believe that the notarial act or transaction is unlawful or immoral.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Rules of Court:** Willful disobedience of a lawful order of a superior court.

**Liabilities & Sanctions:**

*   **Suspension from practice of law:** Three (3) years.
*   **Disqualification from being commissioned as a notary public:** Three (3) years; revocation of current commission.
*   **Prior Administrative Sanctions:** Relevant to severity of penalties, referencing *Mondejar v. Rubia* (528 Phil. 462 (2006)) and *Ceniza v. Rubia* (617 Phil. 202 (2009)).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law; prohibition on sale of CLOA land within 10 years.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Specifically, Canon 1 and Rule 15.07.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 138, Sec. 27:** Grounds for suspension or disbarment.
*   ***Sebastian v. Atty. Bajar***, 559 Phil. 211, 224 (2007): Failure to comply with court orders is gross misconduct and insubordination.
*   ***Caalim-Verzonilla v. Atty. Pascua***, 674 Phil. 550 (2011): Duty of notary to guard against illegal transactions.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Comment from Respondent:** The absence of a comment from Atty. Rubia significantly weakened her position. Her explanations for not filing a comment were deemed insufficient and manipulative, resulting in a waiver of her right to be heard.
*   **Burden of Proof Regarding Misappropriation:** The Court found the allegation of misappropriation of funds not sufficiently substantiated, highlighting the need for concrete evidence beyond bare allegations. Complainant had the burden of proving the allegations of the Complaint.
*   **Severity of Sanction:** While disbarment was considered, the Court opted for suspension, emphasizing that a less severe punishment can suffice.
*   **Repeated Infractions**: Because this was not the first time that respondent was administratively sanctioned by the Court, the Court warned her that future infractions shall be dealt with more severely.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document is clear on the violations and sanctions imposed. There are no obvious ambiguities. The "contentious" aspect lies in Respondent's defiance and failure to defend her actions.
