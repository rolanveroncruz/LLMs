## Legal Document Summary: *Borja, Jr. v. COMELEC & Capco, Jr.*, G.R. No. 133495

**Core Issue:** Whether a vice-mayor who succeeds to the office of mayor by operation of law and serves the remainder of the term is considered to have served a term in that office for purposes of the three-term limit under Article X, Section 8 of the Constitution and Section 43(b) of the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160).

**Facts:** Jose T. Capco, Jr. was elected Vice-Mayor in 1988. He became Mayor in 1989 upon the death of the incumbent. He was subsequently elected Mayor in 1992 and 1995. Borja, Jr. sought to disqualify Capco from running for a fourth term in 1998, arguing Capco had already served three consecutive terms as Mayor. The COMELEC initially agreed, then reversed its decision, allowing Capco to run.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court dismissed Borja's petition, upholding the COMELEC's decision that Capco was eligible to run.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Article X, Section 8 of the Constitution & Section 43(b) of R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Limit elective local officials to three consecutive terms. Crucially, the court emphasizes the language "term for which the local official was *elected*."
*   **Succession vs. Election:** The Court distinguishes between serving a term by election and serving by succession due to vacancy. Succession to office does *not* count as a term for purposes of the three-term limit.
*   **Rationale:** The court underscores two constitutional policies: (1) preventing political dynasties and (2) enhancing the freedom of choice of the people. Disqualifying Capco would infringe on the latter.
*   **Constitutional Commission Deliberations:** The decision cites the Constitutional Commission records, highlighting the intent to preserve voters' freedom of choice and avoid pre-screening candidates. Commissioners rejected perpetual disqualifications after a certain number of terms.
*   **Distinction from Congressional Succession:** While a member of the House of Representatives elected to fill an unexpired term is deemed to have served a full term, this is distinguished because the Representative *is* elected to that position. The Vice-Mayor succeeds by operation of law.
*   **Distinction from Presidential Succession:** The provision in Article VII, Section 4 regarding Presidential succession (limiting re-election eligibility for VPs succeeding to the presidency) is absent in Article X, Section 8, suggesting a deliberate omission regarding local officials. Furthermore, VPs are elected with a view toward possible succession.
*   **Hypothetical Cases:** The Court presents hypothetical cases to illustrate the application of the two conditions that must concur for disqualification: (1) being elected three consecutive times *and* (2) fully serving three consecutive terms.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   The ruling clarifies the conditions under which a local official is deemed to have served a full term for the purpose of term limits.
*   The COMELEC is bound by this interpretation in future cases involving similar facts.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **"Interruption of Service":** While the decision focuses on election vs. succession, the discussion of "voluntary renunciation" and "interruption of service" could lead to future litigation if an official attempts to circumvent term limits through brief resignations.
*   **Broad Interpretation of Voter Choice:** While valuing voter choice is a valid principle, a very broad application could undermine the intent of term limits, especially if succession becomes a recurring method to extend political power.
*   **Defining "Good Faith":** The argument implicitly assumes "good faith" succession. Abuse could arise if an official engineered a vacancy to allow a successor to hold office without being elected to that position.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article X, Section 8 of the Constitution:** Three-term limit for local officials.
*   **Section 43(b) of R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Restates the three-term limit.
*   **Article VI, §§4 and 7 of the Constitution:** Term limits for members of Congress (cited for comparison).
*   **Article VII, §4 of the Constitution:** Presidential succession (cited to distinguish from local official succession).
*   **LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE of 1991, R.A. No. 7160, §44(a).** Succession of Vice-Mayor to Mayor.
*   **Art. VI, §8. of the Constitution** Special elections.
*   **U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 131 L. Ed. 2d 881 (1995)**

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "term for which he was elected" and its application to succession, particularly in situations where the successor benefits politically from the position.
*   The weight given to constitutional commission deliberations, and the specific intent behind allowing voter choice vs. preventing political dynasties.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case provides a narrow interpretation of the three-term limit for local officials, prioritizing voter choice and the distinction between election and succession. This interpretation opens potential avenues for extending political control through succession, requiring careful consideration of future cases where "good faith" succession is questionable.
