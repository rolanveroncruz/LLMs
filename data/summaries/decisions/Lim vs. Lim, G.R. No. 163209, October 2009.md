**Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Prudencio and Filomena Lim vs. Ma. Cheryl S. Lim, et al.* (G.R. No. 163209)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals Decision ordering petitioners (grandparents) to provide support to respondents (grandchildren and daughter-in-law).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 195, Family Code:** Parents and legitimate children are obligated to mutually support one another, extending to legitimate grandchildren.
*   **Article 199, Family Code:** Establishes order of liability for support: Spouse, descendants, ascendants. Ascendants become liable if those in the nearest degree are unable to provide sufficient support.
*   **Joint Liability:** The ruling affirmed the trial court's decision holding the petitioners jointly liable with their son Edward to provide support.
*   **Scope of Liability:** The Supreme Court limited the petitioner's liability for support only to their legitimate grandchildren (Lester Edward, Candice Grace, and Mariano III), excluding Cheryl (daughter-in-law).
*   **Article 204, Family Code (Option to Maintain):** Petitioners' attempt to avail of the option to fulfill support obligation by receiving and maintaining respondents in their household was denied. The Court cited a moral impediment for the daughter in law who was morally affected with the infidelity of her husband in that residence

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Prudencio and Filomena Lim):** Ordered to jointly provide a portion of the support to their grandchildren, the specific amount to be determined by the trial court on remand. Their liability arises from their son's inability to provide sufficient support.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Quantification of Support:** The exact amount of support owed by petitioners requires determination by the trial court on remand. This could be contentious, necessitating further litigation and evidence regarding the grandchildren's needs.
*   **Change in Circumstances:** The ruling is predicated on the financial inability of the parents. Any significant improvement in Edward and Cheryl's financial situation could potentially lead to a modification of the support obligation in the future.
*   **Validity of Marriage:** Should Edward and Cheryl's marriage is declared null and void, the mutual obligation to provide support between them ceases.
*   **Moral Impediment:** Reliance on a "moral impediment" (daughter-in-law's discomfort due to past infidelity) in denying the option to maintain under Article 204 could be scrutinized. The definition and scope of "moral impediment" are not strictly defined in the statute, creating potential for future challenges.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Family Code of the Philippines:** Articles 195, 199, 200, 204
*   ***Patricia v. Dario HI, G.R. No. 170829, 20 November 2006*** This case reiterate the mandate on ascendents to provide legal support to their descendants
*   ***Pelayo v. lawon, 12 Phil. 453, 457 (1908)*** Holding that in-laws are "strangers with respect to the obligation that revolves upon the husband to provide support" to his wife).

**Conclusion:**

The decision clarifies that grandparents can be concurrently liable for support if parents are unable to provide sufficient support, but limits this obligation to legitimate descendants by blood. The remand to the trial court to quantify the amount of support and the ongoing viability of the parents' financial situation presents ongoing risk of further litigation. The decision also suggests that moral considerations can override a person's options for fulfilling support obligations under Article 204.
