Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *V.C. Ponce Company, Inc. vs. Rodolfo Reyes, et al.* G.R. No. 171469, August 11, 2008 (583 Phil. 644)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC order to cancel TCT and issue individual titles.

**Key Facts:**

*   **Underlying Dispute:**  Long-standing dispute arising from contracts to sell between V.C. Ponce (Petitioner) and Rodolfo Reyes, et al. (Respondents) involving lots subdivided from TCT No. 97084. A previous case (Civil Case No. 455-R) was filed by Eusebia de Leon vda. de Rodriquez against the petitioner in the then Court of First Instance of Pasay City on January 3, 1963 docketed as Civil Case No. 455-R. It sought the annulment of the sale of a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 97084 she had previously sold to petitioner.
*   **Previous RTC Decision:** RTC Pasay City ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring the contracts to sell valid, ordering Respondents to pay the balance within 12 months, and ordering Petitioner to deliver clean titles upon full payment (December 6, 1989).
*   **SC Affirmation:** SC affirmed the RTC decision, with Entry of Judgment on December 9, 1991.
*   **Non-Compliance and Execution:** Petitioner repeatedly refused to comply with the RTC's decision, despite writs of execution and orders to deliver clean titles. Respondents consigned payments to the court.
*   **Contempt and Cancellation Order:**  Petitioner was held in contempt. Due to Petitioner's continued refusal to surrender the TCTs, the RTC ordered the cancellation of TCT No. 97084 (the "mother title") and the issuance of individual titles to Respondents (January 23, 2003).
*   **CA Affirmation:** The CA affirmed the RTC's cancellation order, leading to this petition.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Validity of Contracts to Sell:**  The contracts to sell between Petitioner and Respondents are declared valid and binding.
*   **Payment Obligation:** Respondents are obligated to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price, as previously determined.
*   **Title Delivery Obligation:** Petitioner is obligated to deliver clean titles to Respondents upon full payment.
*   **Cancellation of TCT No. 97084:** RTC order, affirmed by the CA and SC, cancels TCT No. 97084 (the mother title) and derivative titles of the lots covered by the respondents' contracts to sell
*   **Issuance of Individual Titles:**  The Registrar of Deeds of Para√±aque is ordered to issue individual titles to Respondents for their respective lots and in the name of the petitioner for those portions not covered by the claims of the respondents.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Contempt of Court:** Petitioner was already found in contempt for non-compliance. Counsel is warned of disciplinary action for further delays.
*   **Treble Costs:** Petitioner is liable for treble costs.
*   **Title Risk:**  Loss of title to the individual lots for which Respondents have fully paid under the contracts to sell.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:**  Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Section 10, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court:**  Execution of judgments for specific acts, including conveyance of land.
*   **Section 107 of PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree):**  Procedure for compelling surrender of withheld duplicate certificates of title.
*   **Velarde v. Social Justice Society, G.R. No. 159357, 28 April 2004, 428 SCRA 283, 309:** Jurisprudence that dispositive portion of court ruling is what prevails and must be executed.
*   **Lao v. King, G.R. No. 160358, August 31, 2006, 500 SCRA 599, 605:** reiterates importance of dispositive ruling of the courts

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Petitioner's Allegation of Prior Cancellation:** Petitioner claims that TCT No. 97084 was already cancelled in another case, but failed to provide supporting evidence.  This claim is dismissed as unsubstantiated.
*   **"Variance" Claim:** Petitioner argued that the order to cancel TCT 97084 improperly expanded the original RTC decision. The SC rejects this, holding the cancellation necessary to effectuate the original intent of delivering clean titles.

**Potential Legal Arguments:**

*   **Res Judicata:** Prior rulings on the validity of the contracts and the obligation to deliver titles preclude further arguments on those issues.
*   **Ministerial Duty:** The RTC has a ministerial duty to enforce its final and executory judgment.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the cancellation of TCT No. 97084 and the directive for issuance of individual titles to Respondents. The court emphasized the binding nature of the prior decisions and the need for prompt execution. The primary risk now falls on the Petitioner, with potential for further contempt proceedings and disciplinary action against counsel for any obstruction.
