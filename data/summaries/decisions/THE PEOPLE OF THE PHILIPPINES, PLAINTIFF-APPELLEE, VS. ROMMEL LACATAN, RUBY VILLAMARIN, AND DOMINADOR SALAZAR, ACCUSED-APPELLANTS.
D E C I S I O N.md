## Legal Document Summary: People v. Lacatan, Villamarin, & Salazar (G.R. No. 121532)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Affirming RTC Conviction)

**Subject Matter:** Robbery with Homicide (Art. 294, par. 1, Revised Penal Code)

**Parties:**
*   Plaintiff-Appellee: The People of the Philippines
*   Accused-Appellants: Rommel Lacatan, Ruby Villamarin, Dominador Salazar

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision finding the accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Robbery with Homicide.
*   **Factual Basis:** The conviction rests primarily on the eyewitness testimony of Eduardo Ruallo, who saw the accused robbing the victim's house and stabbing him to death. The Court found Ruallo's testimony to be credible and straightforward.
*   **Elements of Robbery with Homicide Established:** The Court found that the prosecution successfully proved all elements of the crime, including the taking of property with intent to gain, violence against the victim, and the resulting death on the occasion of the robbery.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The RTC initially found aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, nocturnity and cruelty. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction but did not explicitly uphold the presence of these aggravating circumstances in its final judgment.
*   **Alibi Rejected:** The accused-appellants' defenses of denial and alibi were rejected due to their proximity to the crime scene and the positive identification by the eyewitness. The court cited the well-established principle that alibi is a weak defense that cannot prevail over positive identification.
*   **Damages:** The Court upheld the RTC's order for the accused to indemnify the heirs of Alfredo Salazar for:
    *   P50,000.00 (Death Indemnity)
    *   P100,000.00 (Burial Expenses)
    *   P100,000.00 (Stolen Money)
    *   P50,000.00 (Stolen Jewelry)
    *   P20,000.00 (Stolen Goods)
    *   Costs of suit

**Obligations:**

*   The accused-appellants are obligated to serve their sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   The accused-appellants are jointly and severally liable to pay the above-mentioned damages to the heirs of Alfredo Salazar.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   Continued imprisonment and financial obligations as defined by the sentence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Further appeals are possible, although unlikely to succeed given the affirmation by the Supreme Court.
*   Enforcement of the judgment for damages may require legal action to seize assets.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   Cited cases support the court's decision, include:
    *   People vs. De Paz, 224 SCRA 474 [l993]
    *   People vs. Dulay, 217 SCRA 103 [1993]
    *   People vs. Dela Paz, Supra.
    *   People vs. Antolin Hayahay, G.R. 120550, Sept. 26, 1997
    *   People vs. Villagracia, 219 SCRA 212, 1993
    *   People vs. Espinosa; 243 SCRA 17, 1995
    *   People vs. Dela Cruz, 229 SCRA 765, [1994];
    *   People vs. Barte, 230 SCRA 408, [1994].

    The court invokes established doctrines regarding:
    *Appellate deference to trial court findings on witness credibility.
    *Sufficiency of a single credible witness.
    *The weakness of alibi as a defense.
    *Requirements for a valid alibi defense (impossibility of presence at the crime scene).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The RTC's finding of the presence of all four aggravating circumstances could be considered contentious as the Supreme Court, while affirming the conviction, did not explicitly address whether they agreed with this finding. This might be relevant if the case were ever considered for executive clemency or other post-conviction relief.
*   The weight given to the circumstantial evidence regarding the specific location of the stabbing and the lack of bloodstains.
*   The initial discrepancy between the eyewitness account of the weapon used ("gulukan") and the medico-legal officer's opinion that two weapons were used.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the strength of the eyewitness testimony and the weakness of the defense. The potential risks for the accused-appellants are significant, including continued imprisonment and substantial financial obligations.
