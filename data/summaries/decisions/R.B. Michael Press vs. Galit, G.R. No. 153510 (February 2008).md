## Legal Document Summary: R.B. Michael Press vs. Galit (G.R. No. 153510)

**Case Overview:** Petition for review of a CA decision finding illegal dismissal. The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA, finding the dismissal legal but awarding nominal damages for failure to observe procedural due process.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Just Cause for Termination:** The SC found just cause for termination based on **insubordination (willful disobedience)** due to Galit's refusal to render overtime work despite a valid order under Art. 89 of the Labor Code. The court considered his habitual tardiness (neglect of duty) and absences as supporting justification, distinguishing *Filipio v. Ople* as no penalties were imposed for past infractions.
*   **Due Process:** While petitioners claimed to have followed due process, the SC found that it was merely simulated.  The "twin notice" requirement outlined in *Agabon v. NLRC* and *King of Kings Transport v. Mamac* was not adequately observed because:
    *   The first notice (warning for dismissal and notice of hearing) was issued and the hearing held on the same day, not allowing Galit sufficient time to prepare a defense or seek counsel.
    *   The notice of dismissal lacked specificity regarding the offenses and violated company rules or Labor Code provisions.
*   **Waiver/Condonation of Offenses:** The CA erred in finding condonation of tardiness because the employee's infractions had not been previously penalized.
*   **Backwages:** Because the SC found legal cause for dismissal, it reversed the CAâ€™s order for reinstatement and backwages. The "day's pay for a day's work" principle applies to daily wage earners.
*   **Nominal Damages:** The SC awarded Galit PhP 30,000 in nominal damages for the violation of his right to procedural due process, citing *Agabon v. NLRC*.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** Obligation to provide procedural due process (twin notice and opportunity to be heard) before termination (Agabon standard).
*   **Employee:** Obligation to obey lawful orders, particularly reasonable overtime requests under Art. 89 of the Labor Code.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Employers):** Liable for nominal damages for violation of procedural due process.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Due Process Lapses:** Failure to meticulously follow the twin notice and hearing requirements can result in liability for nominal damages even when there is just cause for termination.  Timing and specificity of notices are critical.
*   **Misinterpretation of Condonation:** Assuming infractions are condoned by failing to impose penalties promptly can weaken the employer's position in subsequent disciplinary actions, though this case clarifies the need for evidence of explicit waiver or condonation.
*   **Over reliance on Verbal Warnings:** Document all warnings.

**Statutory References:**

*   Labor Code (Art. 89, Art. 282, Art 283, Art 284)
