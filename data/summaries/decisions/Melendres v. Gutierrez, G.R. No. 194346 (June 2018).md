**Case:** *Fernando A. Melendres v. Ombudsman Ma. Merceditas N. Gutierrez and Jose Pepito M. Amores, M.D.* (G.R. No. 194346, June 18, 2018)

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of Melendres' appeal from an Ombudsman decision finding him guilty of Grave Misconduct. The Ombudsman found Melendres, then Executive Director of the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP), liable for improperly placing LCP funds in a Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB) Investment Management Agreement (IMA). The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA's decision, but found Melendres liable for **simple misconduct** and imposed a 3-month suspension without pay.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Realignment of Funds:** DOH/DBM approved realignment of funds (P73,258,377.00) for LCP rehabilitation, covered by SARO No. BMB-B-00-0192.  Melendres was entrusted with implementation.
*   **Investment Management Agreement (IMA):** Melendres requested OGCC review of a proposed IMA with PVB.  However, he transferred funds to PVB *before* receiving OGCC opinion.
*   **LCP Board Resolution (Jan 30, 2002):**  Authorizes the Executive Director to invest unutilized funds in government depository banks (LBP, DBP, PNB, or PVB) offering the highest yield/interest.  *Ambiguity exists regarding whether this resolution specifically authorizes an IMA or simply savings deposits.*
*   **OGCC Opinion (May 3, 2002):**  Advised verification with BSP on PVB's authorization to engage in investment management.  Also advised placing investments in government securities in LCP's name, or if in PVB's name, to indicate PVB as agent. The opinion also suggested clauses covering liability of PVB. The SC highlights that Melendres sought legal opinion.
*   **Non-Compliance with CA Order:** The CA dismissed Melendres' appeal due to failure to submit required documents despite an extension. While the SC found this justified procedurally, it addressed the merits in the interest of justice.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Ombudsman Decision (Initial Finding):**  Originally found Melendres guilty of Grave Misconduct, warranting dismissal.
*   **Supreme Court Finding:**  Reversed Grave Misconduct, but found **Simple Misconduct**.
*   **Simple Misconduct:** The SC based this liability on Melendres' transfer of funds *without a fully executed investment contract and without specific authority from the LCP Board for an investment agreement of that amount specifically with PVB.*  This was deemed a "serious lapse of judgment."
*   **Penalty:** Three (3) months suspension without pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 43, Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies (like the Ombudsman) to the Court of Appeals.  Critical regarding procedural requirements and consequences of non-compliance.
*   **Republic Act No. 3518 (as amended by RA 7169):**  Recognizes Philippine Veterans Bank as a government depository.
*   **CSC Resolution No. 991936 (Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases):** Establishes penalties for administrative offenses.
*   **Sec. 49(b), Rule 10 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** governs the penalty for Simple Misconduct.
* **Seville v. Commission On Audit, 699 Phil. 27, 33 (2012).** cited as it pertains to the penalty for simple misconduct, suspension for one month and one day to six months for the first offense.
* **Yamson v. Castro, G.R. Nos. 194763-64, July 20, 2016, 797 SCRA 592, 686.** cited as it pertains to no mitigating or aggravating circumstance can be appreciated in his favor, the medium penalty of three months suspension is the appropriate penalty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Legal Arguments:**

*   **Interpretation of LCP Board Resolution:**  *Key legal argument centers on whether the resolution authorizes only general deposits with government banks or also allows specific investment agreements (IMAs).  Melendres argued the former; the Ombudsman initially implied the latter was unauthorized without specific Board approval.* The SC seems to fall somewhere in the middle, not specifically disallowing the IMA but stating authority to enter into the specific IMA and amount wasn't clear.
*   **Lack of Corrupt Motives/Willful Intent:**  SC emphasized absence of evidence of corruption, personal benefit, or deliberate violation of rules, leading to downgrading of the offense from Grave to Simple Misconduct. Evidence considered for lack of corruption included the seek of legal opinion from the OGCC and COA findings, in addition to Rojas' Affidavit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While Melendres avoided dismissal, the three-month suspension still represents a negative outcome.
*   This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules in appellate practice, even when substantial justice arguments exist.
*   Government officials must ensure *clear and explicit* authorization from governing boards when making financial decisions, particularly concerning investment agreements.
*   The case turns on the SC's weighing of evidence regarding intent and motivation, underlining the importance of building a strong factual record in administrative cases.
