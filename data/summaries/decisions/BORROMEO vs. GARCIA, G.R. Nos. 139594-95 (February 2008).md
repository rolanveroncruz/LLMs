**Legal Document Summary: *Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc. vs. Edgar John A. Garcia*, G.R. Nos. 139594-95, February 26, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's order to annotate an easement of road right of way on petitioner's title in favor of respondent.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Grant of Right of Way (1938):** Patricia Ruedas Vda. De Andrada granted spouses Gil Garcia and Teresa Esca√±o de Garcia a road right of way over Lot No. 6-H-2.
*   **Deed of Sale (1938):** Subsequent sale of Lot No. 6-H-2 to Borromeo Bros. Estate, Inc. (Petitioner) included a clause making the purchase subject to the existing right of way.
*   **CFI Order (1952):** Court of First Instance (CFI) ordered the annotation of the right of way on TCT No. RT-3972 (Petitioner's title).
*   **RTC Order (1997):** RTC, acting as a cadastral court, ordered the Register of Deeds to inscribe and annotate the road right of way based on the 1938 agreement and the unopposed 1952 CFI Order.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner:** Obligated to respect the easement of road right of way in favor of the Respondent (successor-in-interest to the Garcia couple).
*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligated to annotate the easement on the title.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for damages if Petitioner obstructs or interferes with Respondent's right of way.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Procedural Issues:** Petitioner initially contested the RTC's jurisdiction as a cadastral court to enforce a "stale order," citing Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court and arguments regarding the statute of limitations and prescription. The Supreme Court found no procedural errors committed by the cadastral court.
*   **Due Process Claim:** Petitioner alleged denial of due process in the RTC proceedings. This claim was rejected as the Petitioner was given opportunities to be heard and to submit evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (The Property Registration Decree of 1979):** Cited by the RTC in eliminating the distinction between the general jurisdiction of the RTC and its limited jurisdiction when acting as a Land Registration Court.
*   **Rule 39, Section 6 of the Rules of Court:** Invoked by Petitioner regarding enforcement of a stale order, but rejected by the RTC as inapplicable to special proceedings like land registration.
*   **Estares v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 144755, June 8, 2005, 459 SCRA 604 and related cases:** Cited regarding the requirements of due process.

**Key Arguments & Holding:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The RTC cadastral court acted without jurisdiction and denied due process.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** The easement was validly granted and annotation is necessary to protect the right.
*   **Court's Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision. There was no error of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion by the RTC. The Petitioner was afforded due process. The easement was validly constituted, supported by documented evidence.
* **Cruz v. Leabres, G.R. No. 99846, May 22, 1995, 244 SCRA 194:** Citing this, the RTC stated that should it enforce the questioned order now, any ruling by the Court of Appeals in the petition for certiorari if it is in favor of petitioner BBEI would create a situation wherein the ruling of a higher [c]ourt can no longer be implemented because the lower [c]ourt had chosen to enforce its order without waiting for the outcome of the petition for certiorari.

**Potential Areas of Concern:**

*   While the SC affirmed the CA decision, there is no specific detail of where the easement can be enforced from Lot 6-H-2. This may cause further disputes in the future as to which is the most practical spot for the easement.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the validity and enforceability of the easement of road right of way. Petitioner is obligated to respect the easement, and the Register of Deeds must annotate it on the title.
