## Legal Document Summary: *Torredes v. Villamor*

**Case:** *SPL. POL. LT. RAMON . TORREDES, PETITIONER, VS. CARLOS VILLAMOR, RESPONDENT.* G.R. No. 151110, September 11, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal of a Rule 43 petition for failure to implead PEZA.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   Petitioner (Torredes), a Special Police Lieutenant at Mactan Economic Zone (MEZ) - PEZA, was charged administratively for violation of the Administrative Code of 1987 (E.O. 292), specifically Sec. 46(4) Misconduct and 46(27) Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, based on allegations of extortion and demand for personal favors (lechon) from the MEPZA Drivers' Association.
*   PEZA found Torredes liable for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and dismissed him from service.
*   The Civil Service Commission (CSC) affirmed PEZA's decision.
*   Torredes appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA) but failed to implead PEZA as a respondent, leading to the CA dismissing the appeal.
* Torredes argues that PEZA is not an adverse party and that only private individuals must be party to the appeal.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Torredes:** Obligated to adhere to the standards of conduct expected of a public officer as enshrined in Sec. 1, Article XI of the Constitution. Found administratively liable for Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of Service.
*   **PEZA:** Obligation to investigate and discipline employees based on the Administrative Code (E.O. 292).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Issue:** Whether PEZA is a necessary party in appeals arising from administrative cases initiated by PEZA, and whether the failure to implead PEZA warrants dismissal of the appeal. This is a contentious issue given Torredes' arguments.
*   **Ambiguity:** Potential ambiguity as to the "adverse party" requirement under Rule 43, considering the driver's association was the initial complainant. However, the Court clarifies that the challenge is to PEZA's disciplinary action.

**Holding/Rationale:**

The Supreme Court *affirmed* the CA's dismissal, holding that PEZA was the adverse party that should have been impleaded in the CA appeal. The Court emphasizes the public trust nature of Torredes' position and the administrative liability arising from his actions. The Court found no grounds to relax procedural rules, given the substantial evidence supporting PEZA's findings. Court found no reason to disturb the finding of the PEZA and the CSC which are accorded finality. The Court also pointed out that acts complained of against the petitioner gave rise to three-fold liability of civil, criminal and administrative.
