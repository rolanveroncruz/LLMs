## Legal Document Summary: Dart Philippines, Inc. vs. Spouses Calogcog (G.R. No. 149241)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Third Division) reversing the Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court decisions.

**Key Issue:** Whether Dart Philippines abused its rights under a Distributorship Agreement with Spouses Calogcog when it conducted an audit, switched to a pre-paid basis for orders, and refused to renew the agreement.

**Ruling:**  The Supreme Court held that Dart Philippines did *not* abuse its rights under Article 19 of the Civil Code, reversing the lower courts' decisions awarding damages to the respondents.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Distributorship Agreement:** Governed the relationship, including terms of renewal, order processing, and audit rights.  The court relied heavily on the principle that the agreement had the force of law between the parties (Barons Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals).
*   **Section 2(f) of Distributorship Agreement:** Addressed violations by distributors.
*   **Sections 8 and 9 of the Distributorship Agreement:**  Covered termination, sale of products on hand, and transfer of goodwill.  Respondents alleged breach.
*   **Automatic Renewal Clause (Initial Agreement):**  Originally included in the 1986 agreement (subject to termination by either party); subsequently modified in the 1991 agreement.
*   **Audit Rights:** Dart Philippines had the right to audit respondent's accounts under the agreement.
*   **Pre-Payment Basis for Orders:** Dart Philippines was allowed to vary the manner in which orders were processed, including implementing a pre-paid basis.

**Liabilities/Damages Claimed:**

*   **Actual Damages:**  Alleged to be P1.3M (original complaint) and later supplemented with claims of P4,495,000.00 for goodwill, P1M for products on hand, and P3M for the building investment (supplemental complaint).
*   **Moral and Exemplary Damages:** Awarded by lower courts, reduced by CA.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded by lower courts.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Admission of Supplemental Complaint:**  Petitioner argued it was erroneous for the lower courts to admit the supplemental complaint.  This point was raised on appeal.
*   **Interpretation of "Goodwill" (Section 9):** Respondents argued that the petitioner failed to follow the Section to not paying respondents the value of the products on hand and in their custody, and by not effecting the transfer of their good will to the absorbing distributor;

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 19, Civil Code (Abuse of Rights):** The core legal basis for the respondents' claim. The Court emphasized the elements of abuse of right: (1) legal right or duty; (2) exercise in bad faith; (3) intent to prejudice another. Key case law includes: BPI Express Card Corporation v. Court of Appeals, Heirs of Purisima Nala v. Cabansag, National Power Corporation v. Philipp Brothers Oceanic, Inc., Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, Saber v. Court of Appeals
*   **Barons Marketing Corporation v. Court of Appeals:** Reinforces the principle that a contract is the law between the parties.
*   **Damnum Absque Injuria:**  The legal principle applied because the Court found no legal wrong despite the damages suffered by the respondents.
*   **Doles v. Angeles:** Addresses exceptions to the general rule that the Supreme Court will not review factual findings of the appellate court.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Points (Resolved by the SC):**

*   **Justification for Audit:** The respondents argued the audits were conducted in bad faith to harass them. The SC found the petitioner had legitimate business reasons for the audits based on respondents' violations of the agreement.
*   **Pre-Paid Basis as Harassment:** The respondents argued that the shift to a pre-paid basis was an act of harassment. The SC found that Dart was within its rights to modify the payment terms in light of respondent's actions.
*   **Refusal to Renew as Abuse:** The respondents contended that the refusal to renew was an abuse of right. The Court held that the company had the right to refuse renewal given the identified violations of the Distributorship Agreement.

**Dissenting Opinion (Carpio Morales, J.):**  Concurred with the reversal but dissented on the interest rate for the reimbursement of audit fees, arguing for 6% per annum instead of 12%, citing other Supreme Court cases such as Heirs of Aguilar-Reyes v. Spouses Mijares, JL Invesetment & Development v. Tendon Phils., Spouses Alinas v. Spouses Alinas and ICTSI v. FGU Insurance. Reference was made to Eastern Shipping Lines v. Court of Appeals regarding interest calculations. The dissent also defined "forbearance" in the context of usury law, based on Crismina Garments v. CA.
