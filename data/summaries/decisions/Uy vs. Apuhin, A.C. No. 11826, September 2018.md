**Case:** *Rolando N. Uy vs. Atty. Edmundo J. Apuhin*, A.C. No. 11826, September 5, 2018 (839 Phil. 708)

**Summary:**

This is an administrative case concerning a complaint for disbarment filed by Rolando N. Uy against Atty. Edmundo J. Apuhin for false notarization of a Joint Waiver of Rights, Interests and Ownership covering a parcel of land. The complainant alleged that Atty. Apuhin notarized the document on July 2, 2006, even though both he and his wife were in Taiwan at the time.

**Key Provisions and Violations:**

*   **Violation of 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice:** Atty. Apuhin violated Section 2(b)(1) & (2), Rule IV, and Section 12(1) & (2), Rule II of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.  Specifically, he notarized a document when the signatories were not personally present and were not properly identified through competent evidence of identity (photographic ID or credible witnesses).
*   **Lack of Due Diligence:** The Supreme Court found that Atty. Apuhin failed to exercise due diligence by relying solely on representations made in his office, without requiring proper identification.
*   **Lawyers Oath** The Lawyers Oath was violated, as Atty. Apuhin failed to uphold the integrity of the legal profession.

**Obligations:**

*   Notaries Public have the obligation to ensure the personal presence of signatories at the time of notarization and properly identify them via competent evidence of identity as defined in the Notarial Rules.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Apuhin's notarial commission was revoked and he was disqualified from being commissioned as a Notary Public for two (2) years. He was also suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Representations:** Atty. Apuhin argued that he relied on the representations of the parties, which the Court rejected, highlighting the notary's duty to verify identity.
*   **Defense of Harmless Error:** Atty. Apuhin's defense that the Joint Waiver "turned out to be x x x harmless" because it was only used for a building permit was deemed irrelevant, as the violation lies in the improper notarization itself.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Administrative Matter No. 02-8-13-SC (2004 Rules on Notarial Practice):** This is the core legal basis for the ruling. Sections 1 & 12 of Rule II, Section 2(b) of Rule IV are specifically cited.
*   **Jurisprudence on Notarial Practice:**  The ruling cites *Fabay v. Atty. Resuena, 779 Phil. 151, 158 (2016); Malvar v. Baleros, March 8, 2017, 819 SCRA 620, 634-636* which highlights the public interest in notarization and the requirements for proper acknowledgment.

**Analysis and Implications:**

The case underscores the importance of strict compliance with the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. It clarifies that notaries public cannot simply rely on representations made by parties; they have a positive duty to verify identity and ensure personal presence. Failure to do so can result in serious disciplinary actions, including suspension from the practice of law and revocation of notarial commission. This case serves as a warning to notaries public to exercise utmost care in the performance of their duties. The Court's decision to impose suspension rather than disbarment suggests a balancing of the severity of the offense with considerations of the respondent's age and prior record.
