## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-24-066

**Case:** *Rico John Colorines Garcia v. Hon. Virginia D. Tehano-Ang*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Judge Virginia D. Tehano-Ang for violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Rules 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.02, 3.01, 3.02, 3.07, 3.08, and 3.12, relating to competence, integrity, impartiality, and adherence to the law.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Underlying Criminal Cases:** Judge Ang presided over syndicated estafa cases (Presidential Decree No. 1689 in relation to Article 315, paragraph 2 (a) of the Revised Penal Code) against Garcia and others related to Rigen Marketing.
*   **Alleged Irregular Orders/Actions:**
    *   Conditioned suspension of arrest warrants on voluntary appearance, promising bail even for non-bailable offenses (Syndicated Estafa is Non-Bailable and therefore this is contrary to established procedures).
    *   Ordered Registry of Deeds (RD) to hold property transfers based on unsubstantiated "public information" and conjecture, including the annotation of adverse claims and recovery of titles from transferees.
    *   Allowed amendment of Information to include Garcia's mother without due process.
    *   Allowed non-parties to serve as state witnesses, effectively expanding the scope of the case and usurping prosecutorial functions.
    *   Denied attorney's motion to withdraw despite the client obtaining new counsel.
    *   Granted bail to one accused (Auditor) facing a non-bailable charge (Syndicated Estafa) without proper hearing or considering the strength of evidence of guilt.
    *   Met with parties and held hearings outside of regular court hours, including at the Davao del Norte Provincial Jail and on Saturdays.
    *   Set hearings and directed several individuals including non-parties to appear in the case which has not even reached the pre-trial stage and despite the absence of any motion for the issuance of subpoena.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Argued the complaint was instigated by the complainant's counsel who sought a change of venue.
*   Claimed actions were intended to expedite the proceedings and achieve a peaceful settlement.
*   Justified granting bail as necessary to allow accused to locate assets for restitution.
*   Argued that she had granted Garcia an Omnibus Motion to Suspend Proceedings and to Recall Warrant of Arrest

**Judicial Integrity Board (JIB) Findings & Recommendation:**

*   Found Judge Ang liable for **Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure**.
*   Cited specific instances: granting bail in a non-bailable offense without a hearing, allowing non-parties to participate, denying counsel's motion to withdraw, issuing orders based on hearsay, and holding irregular meetings.
*   Recommended forfeiture of benefits and disqualification from public office.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Agreed with the JIB's findings and recommendation.**
*   Reiterated that judicial remedies (motion for reconsideration, appeal, certiorari) are the proper avenue for challenging judicial errors *unless* those errors are tainted with bad faith, fraud, malice, or dishonesty, as was found to be the case here.
*   Held that while some of the judge's acts cannot be probed into in the administrative proceeding, her granting of bail to Auditor, was arbitrary and whimsical.
*   Confirmed Judge Ang's **Gross Ignorance of the Law or Procedure** due to:
    *   Improperly granting bail for a non-bailable offense without a hearing, contravening Rule 114 of the Rules of Court. Cites *Marzan-Gelacio v. Judge Flores* as an example.
    *   Basing rulings on mere assumptions/conjectures and usurping prosecutorial functions.
    *   Denying a party's right to counsel of choice.
    *   Violating rules on office hours and setting hearings on Saturdays.

**Penalty:**

*   Due to Judge Ang's compulsory retirement on July 19, 2023 the SC could not impose dismissal from service. In lieu thereof,
    *   **Forfeiture of retirement benefits** (except accrued leave credits).
    *   **Disqualification from re-employment in any branch or service of the government**, including government-owned or controlled corporations.
    *   Cited SC Administrative Matter No. 21-08-09-SC, February 22, 2022, Further Amendments to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Procedural Due Process:** The SC emphasized that the actions violated procedural due process in several ways, and could be challenged on appeal/certiorari on these grounds.
*   **Impact on Underlying Cases:** The Supreme Court's decision underscores the severity of the judge's errors. Any judgements rendered in these cases could be subject to challenge based on the due process violations and legal misinterpretations detailed in the ruling.
*   **Reliance on God/Personal Beliefs:** The ruling highlights the danger of a judge substituting personal beliefs for legal principles, creating a risk of arbitrary and unfair decisions.
