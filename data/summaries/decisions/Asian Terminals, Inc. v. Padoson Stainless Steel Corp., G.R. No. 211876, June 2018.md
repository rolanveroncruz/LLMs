## Legal Document Summary: *Asian Terminals, Inc. v. Padoson Stainless Steel Corporation* (G.R. No. 211876)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of ATI's claim for unpaid storage fees.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract for Services:** Padoson contracted with ATI for arrastre, wharfage, and storage services for stainless steel and hot-rolled steel coils.
*   **BOC Hold-Order:** Bureau of Customs (BOC) issued a Hold-Order on the shipments due to Padoson's tax liabilities.
*   **Unpaid Storage Fees:** ATI sued Padoson for P8,914,535.28 in unpaid storage fees.
*   **Padoson's Defense:** Shipments deteriorated in ATI's custody due to ATI's negligence.
*   **RTC/CA Ruling:** Dismissed ATI's claim, holding that the BOC's Hold-Order put the shipments in constructive possession of the BOC, making the BOC liable (though not impleaded). Both Courts also recognized the deterioration of the cargo while in ATI's custody.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed the CA and RTC, finding Padoson liable for the storage fees.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Padoson:** Obligated to pay ATI the unpaid storage fees based on their contract. The BOC Hold-Order does not relieve Padoson of its contractual obligations to ATI. The actual possession of the shipment always remained with ATI.
*   **ATI:** Has a duty to exercise diligence in the storage of the shipments.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Constructive Possession:** The lower courts erroneously applied the concept of "constructive possession" arising from the BOC's Hold-Order. The Supreme Court clarifies that the BOC's jurisdiction over the shipments was solely for enforcing customs laws and collecting Padoson's taxes, not for assuming contractual obligations for storage.
*   **Proof of Damage:** Padoson failed to present admissible evidence proving the shipments deteriorated while in ATI's custody. Photographs were not properly authenticated, and documents related to the Customs case were inadmissible against ATI.
*   **Indispensable Party:** The Supreme Court clarifies that the BOC is NOT an indispensable party. Complete relief can be afforded to ATI by holding Padoson liable without the BOC's participation.
*   **Interest Rate:** Interest is awarded at 12% per annum from August 4, 2006, to June 30, 2013, and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full satisfaction of the judgment award.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority v. Rodriguez, et al. (633 Phil. 196):** Misapplied by the lower courts regarding the concept of constructive possession.
*   **LICOMCEN, Inc. v. Engr. Abainza (704 Phil. 166):** Issues not included in the pre-trial order can only be considered if they are impliedly included in the issues raised.
*   **Articles 2229 and 2234 of the Civil Code:** Regarding exemplary damages, which the SC denied to ATI since the requisite of moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages are absent.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Regarding attorney's fees, which the SC denied to ATI.
*   **Nacar v. Gallery Frames, et al. (716 Phil. 267):** Application of legal interest rates, as amended by BSP-MB Circular No. 799.
*   **Principles of Contract Law:** Relativity of contracts (only binds the parties who entered into it).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, holding Padoson liable for unpaid storage fees. The key argument was the erroneous application of constructive possession and failure to prove damage to the shipments while under ATI's care. The ruling clarifies the obligations of consignees and the limited scope of the BOC's authority related to Hold-Orders. The case also provides guidance on the admissibility of evidence and the determination of indispensable parties.
