**Case Summary: Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. vs. Nicholson Pascual, G.R. No. 163744, February 29, 2008**

**Subject:** Validity of Real Estate Mortgage (REM) constituted by one spouse, Florencia, on property registered in her name as "married to" Nelson Pascual (Nicholson), after a declaration of nullity of marriage, but before liquidation of the conjugal partnership.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 160, Civil Code:** All property of the marriage is presumed conjugal unless proven to belong exclusively to one spouse. (Applied here as the property was acquired prior to the Family Code).
*   **Article 493, Civil Code:** Governs the property relationship of former spouses after dissolution but before liquidation of the conjugal partnership; each co-owner can mortgage their share, but the effect is limited to their portion upon termination of the co-ownership.
*   **Act No. 3135:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages.

**Facts:**

*   Nicholson and Florencia's marriage declared null under Article 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity).
*   Florencia, without Nicholson's consent, mortgaged a property acquired during the marriage to Metrobank to secure a loan. Property titled "Florencia, married to Nicholson."
*   Florencia provided a "Waiver" purportedly signed by Nicholson relinquishing rights to conjugal properties, but it didn't include the specific lot. This was executed pre-nullity.
*   Metrobank foreclosed on the property due to non-payment.
*   Nicholson filed suit to nullify the mortgage, alleging lack of consent.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the lower courts' rulings (RTC and CA) *with modification*.
*   The property is presumed to be conjugal, despite being registered in Florencia's name, due to acquisition during the marriage (Art. 160, Civil Code).
*   The nullity of marriage dissolved the conjugal partnership, but the character of the properties remained conjugal properties. Since there was no liquidation, it was an ordinary co-ownership.
*   Florencia could mortgage her *undivided half* of the property under Art. 493 of the Civil Code.
*   The REM is valid *only* to the extent of Florencia's one-half (1/2) undivided interest.
*   The "Waiver" was found to be a forgery and ineffective.
*   Metrobank, as a banking institution, failed to exercise due diligence in verifying the property's status and Nicholson's consent and cannot be considered a mortgagee in good faith.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank:** Mortgagee only to the extent of Florencia's 1/2 undivided share. Can seek partition of the property. Has obligation to exercise due diligence as a banking institution.
*   **Florencia:** Liable for the loan, but the mortgage is only effective against her share of the property.
*   **Nicholson:** Remains co-owner of 1/2 undivided interest in the property.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Partition:** The partition process could be contentious and costly, and the resulting division may not be favorable to Metrobank. Metrobank has the right to seek partition, but the outcome is uncertain.
*   **Good Faith:** Despite the bank's failure to perform due diligence and not being a "mortgagee in good faith", the lower courts did not find bad faith or a fraudulent purpose to justify damages.
*   **Liquidation of Conjugal Properties:** The case does not resolve the full liquidation of the conjugal properties, which could lead to further disputes between Nicholson and Florencia.
*   **Future Claims:** The validity of any future claims related to the property will depend on the outcome of the partition and other future events.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 160, 493.
*   **Family Code:** Article 36, Article 129.
*   **Act No. 3135:** Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law.
*   **Manongsong v. Estimo, G.R. No. 136773, June 25, 2003:** Discusses the presumption of conjugal ownership.
*   **Castro v. Miat, G.R. No. 143297, February 11, 2003:** Re-emphasizes the presumption of conjugal ownership does not require proving the use of conjugal funds.
*   **Dael v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 68873, March 31, 1989:** Discusses the property relationship after dissolution but before liquidation of a conjugal partnership.
*   **Uy v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 109197, June 21, 2001:** States that mortgagee must look beyond the four corners of the title.

**Conclusion:** The REM is only partially valid. Metrobank is bound by the limitations imposed by Art. 493 of the Civil Code and Nicholson's undivided interest. Metrobank's recourse is limited to Florencia's share and the possibility of partition.
