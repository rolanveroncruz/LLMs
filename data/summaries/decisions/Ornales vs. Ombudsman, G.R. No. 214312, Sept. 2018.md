## Legal Document Summary: *Ornales v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon* (G.R. No. 214312, September 5, 2018)

This Supreme Court decision affirms the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a *certiorari* petition filed by petitioners Ornales et al., challenging the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to indict them for violations of Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code (Usurpation of Authority) and Section 3(e) and (g) of R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act). The case stems from the Sangguniang Bayan of Lemery, Batangas authorizing the Mayor to directly contract with Amellar Solutions for a computerization project.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** The SC reiterates that CA has jurisdiction over Ombudsman decisions in administrative cases (Rule 43 per *Fabian v. Desierto*, 356 Phil. 787 (1998)), while SC has jurisdiction over criminal case findings via *certiorari* (Rule 65 per *Tirol, Jr. v. Del Rosario*, 376 Phil. 115 (1999)). The CA correctly dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction regarding the criminal aspect. The SC can review the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause only if there is grave abuse of discretion.
*   **Probable Cause:** The Ombudsman found probable cause for:
    *   **Violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019:** Undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits to Amellar Solutions due to direct contracting bypassing public bidding.
    *   **Violation of Article 177 of the RPC:** Usurpation of the Bids and Awards Committee's (BAC) function by authorizing direct contracting.
*   **Direct Contracting:** Petitioners argued that the agreement with Amellar Solutions was a form of alternative procurement not requiring public bidding. The SC rejected this, finding that the direct contracting resulted in undue injury to the government.
*   **Speedy Disposition of Cases:** Petitioners claim their right to a speedy disposition was violated due to the lengthy investigation. However, the SC found no "vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays."
*   **Mootness Argument:** Petitioners argued that the criminal cases were dismissed by the RTC and MCTC due to insufficiency of evidence, rendering the petition moot. While noted, this does not negate the jurisdictional correctness of the CA's decision.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners, as members of the Sangguniang Bayan, had a duty to comply with procurement laws.
*   The direct contracting with Amellar Solutions exposed them to potential liability under RA 3019 and the RPC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   While the criminal cases were dismissed for insufficiency of evidence, the affirmed finding of probable cause by the Ombudsman could have lingering reputational damage.
*   The SC's upholding of the Ombudsman's findings reinforces the importance of strict compliance with procurement laws, particularly public bidding requirements.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act):** Specifically, Section 3(e) and (g).
*   **Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code:** Usurpation of authority or official functions.
*   **R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989):** Section 27 (declared unconstitutional in *Fabian v. Desierto*).
*   **R.A. No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act)**
*   **Fabian v. Desierto (356 Phil. 787 (1998)):** Established CA jurisdiction over Ombudsman administrative cases.
*   **Namuhe v. Ombudsman (358 Phil. 781 (1998))**: Elaborated on the import of the Fabian ruling.
*   **Tirol, Jr. v. Del Rosario (376 Phil. 115 (1999)):** Established *certiorari* as the remedy for challenging Ombudsman findings of probable cause in criminal cases.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the exception to public bidding for "proprietary" software can be contentious. The Ombudsman's decision implies that the circumstances didn't sufficiently justify bypassing public bidding.
*   The determination of "undue injury" to the government is a factual matter subject to interpretation.

This case emphasizes the importance of adhering to procurement procedures and avoiding actions that could be perceived as giving unwarranted benefits to private parties, particularly through circumvention of public bidding rules. The SC's decision underscores the limited grounds for judicial intervention in the Ombudsman's findings of probable cause.
