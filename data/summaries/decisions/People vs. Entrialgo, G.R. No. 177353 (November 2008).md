**Case Summary: *People v. Entrialgo*, G.R. No. 177353 (2008)**

**Facts:**

*   Appellant Pancho Entrialgo was charged with two counts of murder for the deaths of Benjamin and Avelina Tabang.
*   The prosecution's primary witness, Rolly Panaligan (Appellant's brother-in-law), testified that Entrialgo confessed to the killings, motivated by ill-feelings after being dismissed from his tanod position by Benjamin Tabang.
*   The RTC found Entrialgo guilty of murder (Benjamin Tabang) and homicide (Avelina Tabang). The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision. Entrialgo was found guilty of murder for the death of Benjamin Tabang (Article 248(5), RPC) and homicide for the death of Avelina Tabang (Article 249, RPC).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 248(5) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines murder, specifically the qualifying circumstance of "treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken defense, or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity."
*   **Article 249 of the RPC:** Defines homicide as the unlawful killing of another without any of the circumstances that would qualify the killing as murder.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in the imposition of *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole for the murder conviction.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Governs the sentencing for the homicide conviction, setting a minimum and maximum term of imprisonment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:**
    *   *Reclusion Perpetua* (without parole) for the murder conviction.
    *   Indeterminate sentence of 12 years of *prision mayor* (maximum period) to 20 years of *reclusion temporal* (maximum period) for the homicide conviction.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   P75,000 civil indemnity *ex delicto* to the heirs of Benjamin Tabang.
    *   P50,000 moral damages to the heirs of Benjamin Tabang.
    *   P50,000 civil indemnity *ex delicto* to the heirs of Avelina Tabang.
    *   P50,000 moral damages to the heirs of Avelina Tabang.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstances of the Crime:** The RTC did not clarify why nighttime was an aggravating circumstance.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** The RTC only found evident premeditation regarding the death of Benjamin Tabang.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The conviction relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and the testimony of Rolly Panaligan, whose credibility could be challenged (brother-in-law of the defendant).
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** The Appellant's defense was an uncorroborated denial, making it weak against the prosecution's evidence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Articles 248(5) and 249:** Definition of Murder and Homicide.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibition of the Death Penalty.

*   The testimony of the brother-in-law was compelling to the court.
*   Entrialgo had a clear motive to kill Benjamin Tabang
