## Legal Document Summary: *Baguio v. Bandal, Jr.* G.R. No. 126442 (1998)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court dismissing a Petition for Certiorari assailing a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Order that amended the dispositive portion of a final and executory judgment.

**Key Provisions and Events:**

*   **Original RTC Decision:**  The RTC rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 4622 (Annulment of Documents, Partition, Accounting, and Damages) ordering petitioners (Baguio and Simbajon) to deliver possession of *Lot 1868* and its improvements to the respondents (Heirs of Absin, et al.) and ordering the partition of *Lot 1868*.
*   **Finality & Execution:** The RTC judgment became final and executory. Respondents moved for execution. Petitioners moved to quash the writ, claiming they could not comply because Lot 1868 was owned by third parties.
*   **RTC Amendment:**  The RTC *sua sponte* amended paragraphs 8 & 9 of its dispositive portion, changing "Lot 1868" to "Lot 1898." The RTC justified the amendment as a correction of a clerical/typographical error.
*   **Petition for Certiorari:** Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, arguing the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in amending a final and executory judgment.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED the Petition, finding no grave abuse of discretion.  The SC held the error was merely clerical/typographical, that the entire case history (pleadings, evidence) pointed to Lot 1898 as the subject property. The SC cited precedents allowing amendment of final judgments to correct harmless clerical errors or clarify ambiguities.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners:** Are obliged to deliver possession of Lot 1898 (not 1868) and its improvements to Respondents and facilitate partition of the land.
*   **Respondents:** Entitled to take possession of Lot 1898.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Enforcement Issues:** The change in lot number may raise issues during enforcement if petitioners continue to argue that the execution cannot be implemented.
*   **Third Party Claims:** The original argument raised by petitioners about the ownership of Lot 1868 by a third party (Heirs of Factoran) is unresolved. This might become a future issue regarding ownership and possession.
*   **Res Judicata:**  This case now presents *res judicata* as to the correct lot number, preventing future litigation on that specific issue between the parties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court:** (Certiorari) Used as the basis for the Petition challenging the RTC Order.
*   ***Vda. de Reyes vs. Court of Appeals, 1609 SCRA 524 & 198 SCRA 19***: Cited by the RTC and SC to justify the amendment of a final and executory judgment to correct clerical errors.
*   ***Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 198 SCRA 19; Hiyas Savings and Loan Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 202 SCRA 543***:  Cited by the RTC to justify amending a final judgment to clarify ambiguities.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Rationale for Amendment:** The core issue is whether the discrepancy was truly a *harmless* clerical error.  Petitioners disputed this, implying a more substantial issue, perhaps connected to the Heirs of Factoran's claim to Lot 1868. This could be a point of future contention if the execution proves difficult.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court's decision appears to be based on a reasonable interpretation of the record, finding the error in lot number was clerical and did not prejudice the core findings of the original judgment. However, the unresolved claim regarding Lot 1868 (and the Heirs of Factoran) injects a level of uncertainty and could lead to future litigation or enforcement obstacles.
