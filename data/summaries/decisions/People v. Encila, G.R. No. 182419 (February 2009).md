## Legal Document Summary: People v. Encila, G.R. No. 182419 (2009)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision affirming Court of Appeals Decision affirming RTC Decision

**Subject Matter:** Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride ("Shabu") in violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5 (Illegal Sale):** Prohibits unauthorized sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs.  The penalty for sale of shabu is life imprisonment to death (effectively life imprisonment per RA 9346) and a fine ranging from P500,000 to P10,000,000.
*   **Section 11 (Illegal Possession):** Prohibits unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs.  The penalty varies based on quantity.  For less than 5 grams of shabu, the penalty is imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years and a fine ranging from P300,000 to P400,000.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-appellant Wilfredo Encila was apprehended in a buy-bust operation conducted by the Makati City Anti-Drug Abuse Council (MADAC).
*   He was charged with (1) selling 0.22 grams of shabu (Crim. Case No. 03-3693) and (2) possessing 2.63 grams of shabu (Crim. Case No. 03-3694).
*   MADAC operative Ruben Potencion acted as poseur-buyer.
*   The marked money (P500 bill) was recovered from Encila.
*   Forensic examination confirmed the substances to be methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   Encila denied the charges, claiming he was arrested at a friend's house while his TV was being repaired.

**Court Holdings:**

*   **RTC:** Found Encila guilty beyond reasonable doubt on both charges.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the RTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals decision.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  The Court gave weight to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses (police officers), emphasizing the trial court's advantage in observing their demeanor.  The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties applied.
*   **Elements of Illegal Sale (Section 5) Proven:**  The Court found that the prosecution proved the identity of the buyer and seller, the object (shabu), the consideration (P500), the delivery of the shabu, and the payment therefor. The buy-bust operation was a valid form of entrapment.  Referenced *People v. Mala, 458 Phil. 180, 190 (2003).*
*   **Elements of Illegal Possession (Section 11) Proven:**  The Court found that Encila was in possession of shabu, the possession was unauthorized, and he freely and consciously possessed the drug. Referencd *People v. Lagata, 452 Phil. 846, 853 (2003).*
*   **Defense of Denial and Alibi:**  The Court discredited Encila's defense of denial and alibi, finding inconsistencies in his and his daughter's testimonies and noting the failure to present a key corroborating witness (Danny).  Bare denials cannot overcome positive identification by prosecution witnesses. Referenced *People v. Pacis, 434 Phil. 148, 160 (2002).*
*   **Penalties:** The penalties imposed by the lower courts were correct under R.A. 9165 and the Indeterminate Sentence Law (R.A. 4103).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Police Testimony:** The heavy reliance on the credibility of the police officers, without significant independent corroboration beyond forensic testing, presents a potential risk. The Court acknowledged this to be the reality of such cases by stating that "Prosecutions involving illegal drugs largely depend on the credibility of the police officers". This lack of independent corroboration could be challenged on appeal if irregularities in the buy-bust operation were alleged.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 and 11.
*   **R.A. 9346 (An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty):** Effectively substitutes death with life imprisonment.
*   **R.A. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law):** Used to determine the range of imprisonment.
*   **People v. Mala, 458 Phil. 180, 190 (2003).** The Court cites this as a reference in it's holding.
*   **People v. Lagata, 452 Phil. 846, 853 (2003).** The Court cites this as a reference in it's holding.
*   **People v. Pacis, 434 Phil. 148, 160 (2002).** The Court cites this as a reference in it's holding.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction based on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, the positive identification of the accused, and the successful execution of a buy-bust operation. The defense's arguments were deemed insufficient to overcome the prosecution's evidence and the presumption of regularity afforded to law enforcement. While there might be some concern about the heavy reliance on police testimony, the case was fairly conclusive.
