## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Rendon* (G.R. No. 227873)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Appeal from CA decision affirming RTC conviction)

**Subject Matter:** Violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs - Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or "Shabu")

**Key Issue:** Whether the appellant, Bernardo Rendon y Pascua, is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of selling dangerous drugs, specifically shabu.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *acquits* Rendon based on reasonable doubt due to the prosecution's failure to comply with the chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640. The CA and RTC decisions are reversed.

**Key Provisions/Statutory References:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:**  Criminalizes the sale, trading, delivery, or giving away of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21 of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for the custody and disposition of seized dangerous drugs, including physical inventory and photography in the presence of the accused (or their representative/counsel), an elected public official, and a representative from the National Prosecution Service (NPS) or the media. These individuals must sign the inventory.
*   **Section 1 (A. 1.10) of the Chain of Custody Implementing Rules and Regulations:** Requires sworn statements/affidavits of apprehending officers to clearly state any justification for non-compliance with Section 21(1) of RA 9165, as amended, and detail the steps taken to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.

**Chain of Custody Failure:** The prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody because:

*   **Three-Witness Rule Violation:** The physical inventory and photography of the seized shabu was only witnessed by a media representative.  No elected public official or Department of Justice (DOJ)/National Prosecution Service (NPS) representative was present, violating the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   **Insufficient Justification for Non-Compliance:** The officers offered "lack of time" as justification, but the Court found this unconvincing given they had prior knowledge of the planned buy-bust operation. There was no satisfactory explanation in the sworn affidavits for the absence of the mandated witnesses.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Ocampo (G.R. No. 232300, 1 August 2018):**  Highlights the importance of the three witnesses to prevent planting of evidence and frame-ups.
*   **People v. Sipin (G.R. No. 224290, 11 June 2018):**  Places the burden on the prosecution to prove compliance with Section 21, including the mandatory presence of the three witnesses, and emphasizes the need for adequate explanation for deviations.
*   **People v. Lim (G.R. No. 231989, 4 September 2018):**  Outlines mandatory guidelines for proving chain of custody under Section 21, emphasizing the need for detailed sworn statements explaining compliance or justification for non-compliance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in RA 10640 is a potential area of contention. Courts are increasingly scrutinizing the justifications offered for non-compliance, requiring concrete evidence and detailed explanations.
*   The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) also offer some flexibility when a proviso added that "non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items."

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   **Law Enforcement:** Obligation to strictly adhere to the procedures outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165 to ensure the admissibility of evidence in drug cases. Failure to do so can result in the acquittal of the accused.
*   **Prosecution:** Bears the burden of proving compliance with Section 21, including justifying any deviations from the prescribed procedure.
*   **Apprehending Officers:** Must provide detailed and credible justifications for any non-compliance with Section 21 in their sworn statements/affidavits, along with steps taken to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.

**Conclusion:** This decision highlights the critical importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to properly justify the absence of mandatory witnesses led to the appellant's acquittal, even though the lower courts had found him guilty. It underscores the need for law enforcement to meticulously follow statutory procedures and document every step of the drug seizure and handling process to ensure a successful prosecution.
