**Legal Document Summary: _Fatima O. De Guzman-Fuerte v. Spouses Silvino S. Estomo and Concepcion C. Estomo_, G.R. No. 223399, April 23, 2018**

**Nature of Document:** This is a Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding an unlawful detainer action.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** Block 3, Lot 2, Birmingham Homes, Dalig City 1, Antipolo City, covered by TCT No. R-55253.
*   **Petitioner's Claim:** Fatima O. De Guzman-Fuerte (Fuerte) claims ownership through foreclosure of a real estate mortgage executed by Manuela Co (Co). Fuerte alleges Spouses Estomo are illegally occupying the property and failed to vacate despite a demand letter.
*   **Respondents' Claim:** Spouses Estomo claim they acquired the property from Homeowners Development Corporation via a Contract to Sell in 1999 and possess TCT No. 407613. They allege Co, a real estate broker, fraudulently obtained their title, leading to the mortgage with Fuerte. They filed an annulment case against Co and Fuerte.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   MTCC dismissed the unlawful detainer complaint.
    *   RTC reversed, ordering Spouses Estomo to vacate and pay compensation.
    *   CA reversed the RTC, dismissing the unlawful detainer case.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, denying Fuerte's petition.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Fuerte's Obligation:** To properly establish a cause of action for unlawful detainer.
*   **Spouses Estomo's Potential Liability:** Payment of compensation for use and occupation of the property, although this was rejected due to the dismissal of the unlawful detainer action.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Unlawful Detainer Cause of Action:**  The core risk for Fuerte is the failure to adequately plead unlawful detainer. The complaint alleges Spouses Estomo's possession was illegal from the outset, contradicting the requirement that possession was initially lawful (by contract or tolerance) before becoming unlawful due to the expiration or termination of the right to possess.
*   **"Tolerance" Issue:** The allegation of "tolerance" is unsupported by factual averments showing any overt act of permission by Fuerte or her predecessors-in-interest. This is a crucial point, as tolerance needs to be affirmatively demonstrated.
*   **Co's Fraudulent Acts:** The alleged fraudulent actions of Manuela Co introduce a separate claim of fraudulent acquisition of the property.  Estomo's filing for annulment of deed of absolute sale and real estate mortgage against Co and Fuerte serves as evidence that there was never any tolerance on their side. This casts doubt on the validity of the underlying mortgage and subsequent foreclosure.
*   **Impact on Ownership:** The decision explicitly states that the dismissal of the unlawful detainer action is "not a bar for the parties or even third persons to file an action for the determination of the issue of ownership." This implies Fuerte will need to file an *accion reivindicatoria* to definitively establish ownership and recover possession.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70, Section 1, Rules of Court:** Defines unlawful detainer.  The SC emphasizes the need for the complaint to clearly fall within the scope of this rule.
*   **Rule 70, Section 2, Rules of Court:** Outlines the requirements for demand to vacate, which was raised but not determinative in the SC's analysis.
*   **Rule 40, Section 8, Rules of Court:** Addresses appeals from orders dismissing a case for lack of jurisdiction. Fuerte argued that the CA should have remanded the case to the RTC, which has the original and exclusive jurisdiction over the nature and subject matter of the complaint to proceed with the case
*   ***Padlan v. Dinglasan***: Jurisdiction is determined by the allegations in the complaint.
*   ***Canlas v. Tubil***:  Defines unlawful detainer.
*   ***Macaslang v. Spouses Zamora***:  Outlines the requirements for a valid unlawful detainer complaint.
*   ***Quijano v. Amante***: Possession must be originally lawful for unlawful detainer.
*   ***Serrano v. Spouses Gutierrez***: Addresses the application of Rule 40 Section 8, and discusses how RTC should decide the case on the merits.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the unlawful detainer action due to Fuerte's failure to adequately plead a cause of action under Rule 70. The complaint did not establish that Spouses Estomo's possession was initially lawful or tolerated, but rather alleged unlawful occupancy from the beginning.  Fuerte's remedy to recover possession lies in an *accion reivindicatoria* to establish ownership, given the complexity of the title dispute and the Estomo's prior claims.
