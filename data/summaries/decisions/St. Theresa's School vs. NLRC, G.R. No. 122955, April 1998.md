**Case Summary: St. Theresa’s School of Novaliches Foundation vs. NLRC and Esther Reyes (G.R. No. 122955, April 15, 1998)**

**Key Issue:** Propriety of awarding backwages when the NLRC had already ruled the employee's dismissal valid.

**Facts:**

*   Esther Reyes was hired by St. Theresa's School of Novaliches Foundation under a fixed-term contract (June 1, 1991 - March 31, 1992).
*   Reyes went on leave and upon return allegedly found her position filled.
*   Reyes filed a case for illegal dismissal (NLRC NCR Case No. 00-03-01481-92), claiming harassment and unfair labor practices.
*   Labor Arbiter initially ruled in Reyes' favor, ordering reinstatement and backwages.
*   The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision, declaring the separation legal and valid but *awarded backwages from November 12, 1993, up to the date of their Resolution.*
*   Reyes did not appeal the NLRC's finding of valid dismissal. The School appealed the award of backwages.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *granted* the School's petition, *deleting* the NLRC's award of backwages.

**Rationale:**

*   **Fixed-Term Contract:** The Court upheld the validity of the fixed-term contract, citing *Brent School Inc., v. Zamora*. Article 280 of the Labor Code was not violated.
*   **Backwages and Illegal Dismissal:** Backwages are compensation for earnings lost due to *illegal* dismissal. Since the NLRC already determined the dismissal was valid, the award of backwages was improper and contrary to law.

**Key Provisions & Legal Principles:**

*   **Article 280, Labor Code:** Discusses regular vs. probationary employment but not necessarily a bar to fixed-term contracts under specific circumstances.
*   **Fixed-Term Employment:** Upheld, emphasizing the requirement for consent free from force, duress, or improper pressure.
*   **Backwages:** Defined as earnings lost due to illegal dismissal. Not applicable when dismissal is ruled valid.
*   **Manual of Regulations for Private Schools:** Sets conditions for private teachers achieving security of tenure (full-time, three consecutive years of service, satisfactory service).
*   **Case Law:**
    *   *Brent School Inc., v. Zamora:*  Key precedent on the validity of fixed-term employment contracts.
    *   Cites numerous cases regarding the purpose and award of backwages, including *Citytrust Banking Corporation v. NLRC*
*   **St. Theresa’s School of Novaliches Foundation vs. NLRC and Esther Reyes (G.R. No. 122955, April 15, 1998)***

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **The NLRC awarded backwages even after finding the dismissal was valid,** this contradicts labor principles.
*   **Inaction on the Motion for Partial Execution:** The Labor Arbiter did not take immediate action on the private respondent's motion for partial execution of reinstatement.

**Advice:**
The ruling clarified that in cases of employees with fixed-term contracts, which are valid and agreed upon without coercion, cannot claim backwages once their dismissal has been determined as legal and valid.
