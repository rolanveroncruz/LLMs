## Legal Document Summary: Fuentes v. Judge Buno (A.M. No. MTJ-99-1204)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in an administrative case against Judge Romualdo G. Buno for abuse of discretion and authority, and graft and corruption.

**Key Issue:** Whether Judge Buno violated judicial ethics and rules on notarial practice by preparing and notarizing an "Extra-Judicial Partition with Simultaneous Absolute Deed of Sale" as an ex-officio notary public.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Respondent's Admission:** Judge Buno admitted to preparing and notarizing the document outside office hours, involving the sale of land by the heirs of Bernardo Fuentes to Ma. Indira Auxtero.
*   **Unauthorized Act:** The Court found that this act exceeded the scope of his authority as an ex-officio notary public under SC Circular No. 1-90, which limits notarization to documents directly related to official judicial functions. The subject document was a private contract.
*   **Violation of SC Circular No. 1-90:** Judge Buno failed to include a certification in the notarized document attesting to the lack of any lawyer or notary public in his municipality. He also failed to account for notarial fees, if any were charged.
*   **Violation of the Rules on Notarial Practice:**  Specifically, Rule IV, Sec. 6(a) regarding notarizing a document without the requisite SPA or verifying the scope of the authority provided in the SPA, as the SPA of PO2 Geronimo Fuentes only authorized a mortgage.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:**  Found liable for failure to comply with SC Circular No. 1-90 and the Rules on Notarial Practice.
*   **Financial Penalty:** Fined P12,000, deducted from retirement benefits.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith Argument:** While Judge Buno argued good faith and reliance on the representations of the parties involved, the Court held that this was irrelevant given his failure to adhere to the explicit requirements of SC Circular No. 1-90.  This highlights the strict liability nature of the violation.
*   **Lack of Transparency Regarding Fees:** The decision notes the respondent's silence on the collection and remittance of notarial fees, raising concerns about potential financial impropriety.
*   **Impact on the Deed:** The decision focuses on the administrative liability of the Judge, however, the validity of the "Extra-Judicial Partition with Simultaneous Absolute Deed of Sale" could be challenged in separate civil proceedings given the issues with Geronimo Fuentes's SPA and the Judge's violation of notarial practice rules.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 296, Section 76 (as amended):** Addresses miscellaneous powers of Justices of the Peace, including acting as ex-officio notary public.
*   **Revised Administrative Code, Section 242:** Designates officials acting as notaries public ex officio.
*   **SC Circular No. 1-90:** Defines the scope of authority of MTC and MCTC judges acting as notaries public ex officio (citing *Borre v. Mayo, Adm. Matter No. 1765-CFI*; *Penera v. Dalocanog, Adm. Matter No. 2113-MJ*; *Lapena, Jr. vs. Marcos, Adm. Matter No. 1969-MJ*).  This circular is central to the decision.
*   **Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004, Rule IV, Sec. 6(a):** Prohibits notarizing blank or incomplete instruments.
*   **Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 5 and Rule 5.07):** Restricts judges' extra-judicial activities to avoid conflicts of interest.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Governs administrative sanctions for judges.
*   *Gravela v. Villanueva, A.M. No. 02-1414-MTJ*: Case is cited but there is no specific reference to its relevance on the matter

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The assurance from the mother and brother that they would be responsible for PO2 Geronimo Fuentes, and the vendee's offer to reserve the share of Geronimo Fuentes, are legally questionable. Such assurances do not validate an improperly notarized document or cure defects in the SPA.
*   The assertion that the respondent judge could not be charged with graft and corruption for notarizing the document since municipal judges are allowed to notarize documents or deeds as ex-officio notary public is misleading. Although they are allowed, the action has to be within his jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed that judges must strictly adhere to the limitations imposed by SC Circular No. 1-90 and the Rules on Notarial Practice when acting as ex-officio notaries public. The case emphasizes the importance of verifying the scope of authority granted in Special Powers of Attorney and complying with all procedural requirements.  The violation of these rules, even in the purported interest of helping the parties or in the absence of other notaries, constitutes a breach of judicial ethics and warrants administrative sanctions. The decision raises concerns about the validity of the underlying Deed, which may be subject to future legal challenges.
