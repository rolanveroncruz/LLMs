## Legal Document Summary: *Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. Atty. Ernesto B. Flores* (A.C. No. 4058)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceedings against Atty. Ernesto B. Flores for forum shopping and making false statements.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Forum Shopping:** Atty. Flores, representing losing board members in *Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. NLRC* (G.R. No. 89070), filed multiple actions seeking to enjoin the execution of a final judgment in a labor case:
    *   Motion for Clarification (Supreme Court - noted without action)
    *   Injunction suit (Civil Case No. 2738-R) in RTC Baguio City to restrain execution of the NLRC writ (dismissed).
    *   Separate complaints for Judicial Declaration of Family Home (Civil Cases Nos. 93-F-0414 and 93-F-0415) in RTC La Trinidad, Benguet, seeking to exempt properties from levy.
*   **Falsehood:** Atty. Flores stated in his Comment to the Supreme Court that he did not perfect the appeal of the dismissed injunction suit, while records showed he did file and perfect an appeal (later withdrawn).

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 10, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Candor, fairness, and good faith to the court; duty not to do any falsehood or mislead the court.
*   **Canon 12, Code of Professional Responsibility:** Duty to assist in speedy and efficient administration of justice; prohibition against unduly delaying cases.
*   **Former Rules of Court (1964):** Section 1(e) of Rule 16 and Section 4 of Rule 2.
*   **SC Circular No. 28-91:** Although not directly applicable regarding the certification requirement (as it applied primarily to filings in the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals at the time and not to lower courts), the ruling holds him liable for forum shopping and false statements.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Suspension from the practice of law. The Supreme Court increased the IBP recommended suspension from six (6) months to one (1) year for forum shopping and an additional year for falsehood (total of two years).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Benguet Electric Cooperative, Inc. vs. NLRC, 209 SCRA 55:** The underlying case that led to the execution.
*   **Chemphil Export and Import Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 251 SCRA 257:** Defined forum shopping.
*   **Modequillo vs. Breva, 185 SCRA 765; Manacop vs. Court of Appeals, 215 SCRA 773:** Established that family homes are constituted by operation of law under the Family Code.
*   **SC Circular No. 28-91:** Prohibition against forum shopping.
*   **Family Code, Article 153:** Defines how Family homes are constituted.
*   **Millare vs. Montero, 246 SCRA 1; Garcia vs. Francisco, 220 SCRA 512:** Cited as precedent for the one-year suspension for forum shopping.
*   **Ordonio vs. Eduarte, 207 SCRA 229; Porac Trucking, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 202 SCRA 674; Erectors, Inc. vs. NLRC, 166 SCRA 728:** Referenced to show the Court's previous practice of a 6 month penalty for false statements

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   While the Supreme Court clarifies that Circular 28-91's certification requirement was not directly applicable to lower courts at the time of the filings, it still finds Atty. Flores guilty of forum shopping under the general prohibition against it.
*   The increased penalty is based on the aggravating circumstance that the falsehood was committed to conceal the forum shopping, which strengthens the case.
*   The decision creates precedent for harsher penalties for misconduct, particularly when coupled with attempts to deceive the court.
    *   The delay of IBP in handing down its recommendation is a possible concern.
