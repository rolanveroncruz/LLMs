## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. vs. Antonio T. Reus* (G.R. No. 160474)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 seeking to set aside the CA decision granting mandamus for the execution of a final NLRC decision.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Final and Executory NLRC Decision (Oct. 7, 1993):**  Ordered PLDT to pay Reus "benefits under its company retirement plan, less the amount of the lost collection and other outstanding obligations." This modified the Labor Arbiter's decision, which had conditioned retirement benefits on Reus' *entitlement* under the plan. The SC previously dismissed both parties petitions challenging this decision.
*   **CA Decision (March 28, 2003):** Granted Reus' petition for mandamus, directing the Labor Arbiter to execute the modified NLRC decision.
*   **Issue:**  PLDT argues that Reus, at 36 with 16 years of service, was ineligible for retirement benefits under its plan, and therefore the execution exceeds the scope of the NLRC decision.
*   **SC Ruling:** Denied PLDT's petition, affirming the CA decision and upholding the execution of the NLRC decision.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **PLDT:** Obligated to pay Reus retirement benefits as stipulated in the 1993 NLRC decision, as an "equitable solution," despite his potential ineligibility under the formal terms of the company retirement plan.
*   **Labor Arbiter:** Obligated to execute the 1993 NLRC decision as interpreted by the SC, which bypasses the condition of retirement eligibility.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in NLRC Decision:** PLDT argues the 1993 NLRC decision should be read to mean Reus only receives retirement benefits if he is eligible under the retirement plan. The Court however, interprets this as an *equitable* grant outside the normal criteria of eligibility.
*   **Finality vs. Fairness:** PLDT's core argument hinges on fairness and the contention that Reus is receiving benefits he is not entitled to. However, the SC emphasizes the finality of the 1993 NLRC decision. The equitable award and its terms are final, not the interpretation of the retirement plan in general.
*   **Precedent:** SC is careful to state that this case is *not* precedent for interpreting PLDTs retirement plan, only the final equitable award to Reus is being affirmed.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Basis for the petition for review on certiorari.
*   **Nasser v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 115829, June 5, 1995, 245 SCRA 20:** Cited to emphasize the importance of terminating litigation when a judgment becomes final.
*   **Revised Circular 1-88:** Referenced in the dismissal of Reus' earlier petition (G.R. No. 113737)

**Summary Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court's decision rests heavily on the principle of finality of judgment. While PLDT argues the NLRC decision *should* be interpreted to require eligibility under the retirement plan, the SC holds that the decision, as written, is an "equitable solution" that bypasses that requirement. The risk for PLDT stemmed from failing to appeal the NLRC's decision modifying the Labor Arbiter's original order, which opened the door to the SCs determination that equitable considerations outweigh strict adherence to the plan's eligibility rules. This is a situation where PLDT is bound by an older decision it failed to challenge in a timely manner.
