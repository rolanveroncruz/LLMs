## Legal Document Summary: St. Martin Funeral Home vs. NLRC & Aricayos (G.R. No. 130866)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC in reversing the Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing a complaint for illegal dismissal.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** St. Martin Funeral Home (Employer)
*   **Respondents:** National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and Bienvenido Aricayos (Alleged Employee)

**Key Provisions & Factual Background:**

*   **Dispute:** Aricayos claims illegal dismissal from his position as Operations Manager. St. Martin's Funeral Home denies an employer-employee relationship, alleging Aricayos was merely a volunteer relative. The core issue revolves around the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Aricayos claimed he was dismissed for allegedly misappropriating â‚±38,000 intended for VAT payment.
*   **Labor Arbiter's Decision:** Ruled in favor of the employer, finding no employer-employee relationship and therefore no jurisdiction.
*   **NLRC Resolution:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter, finding errors in the arbiter's evaluation of evidence, and remanded the case for further proceedings.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the Labor Arbiter's decision.

**Legal Issues & Analysis:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** This is the primary factual issue. The case hinges on whether Aricayos was indeed an employee or a mere volunteer. This determination requires application of the "four-fold test" (selection and engagement, payment of wages, power of dismissal, and employer's power to control the employee's conduct) as established in Philippine jurisprudence (e.g., *Brotherhood Labor Unity Movement in the Phil. v. Zamora*, 147 SCRA 49).
*   **NLRC Jurisdiction:** Derivative of the determination of the employer-employee relationship. If no such relationship exists, the NLRC lacks jurisdiction (Art. 224, Labor Code).
*   **Mode of Judicial Review of NLRC Decisions:** The court extensively discusses the proper mode of review of NLRC decisions in light of B.P. 129 (as amended by R.A. 7902) and its perceived ambiguity regarding appeals. While previously understood as Certiorari under Rule 65, the amendments to B.P. 129 create confusion.
*   **Court's Interpretation of R.A. 7902:** The court interprets the amended Section 9 of B.P. No. 129 to mean that *petitions for certiorari* under Rule 65, and not appeals, are the appropriate vehicle for judicial review of NLRC decisions. *This is a pivotal holding.*

**Court Ruling:**

*   The Court *remanded* the petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action and disposition consistent with the views and ruling set forth in the decision.
*   **Important Legal Doctrine:** The court clarified that all references in the amended Section 9 of B.P. No. 129 to supposed appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court are interpreted and declared to mean petitions for certiorari under Rule 65. This significantly altered the procedure for judicial review of NLRC decisions.

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Finding of Illegal Dismissal:** If the Court of Appeals determines an employer-employee relationship existed, the funeral home faces potential liability for back wages, separation pay (if reinstatement is not feasible), and damages (moral and exemplary) to Aricayos.
*   **Costs and Attorney's Fees:** The losing party may be liable for costs and attorney's fees.

**Relevant Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Labor Code of the Philippines (P.D. No. 442):** Articles pertaining to jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and NLRC, illegal dismissal, and employer-employee relationships. Specifically, Article 224 (Jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter), and Article 223 (Appeal).
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980), as amended by R.A. No. 7902:** Section 9 defining the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari.
*   ***San Miguel Corporation vs. Secretary of Labor*, 64 SCRA 56.** - Legal basis for SC jurisdiction to review decisions of NLRC even without provision for appeal.
*   ***Brotherhood Labor Unity Movement in the Phil. v. Zamora*, 147 SCRA 49** - Four-fold test in determining employer-employee relationship.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Section 9 of B.P. 129 (as amended by R.A. 7902) regarding the mode of judicial review of NLRC decisions was the key contentious issue addressed by the Court. The court explicitly recognized and clarified the legislative ambiguity, resolving it by stating that Rule 65 certiorari petitions are the proper procedure.
