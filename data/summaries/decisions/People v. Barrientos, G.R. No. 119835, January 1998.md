**Case:** People of the Philippines vs. Joseph Barrientos, G.R. No. 119835, January 28, 1998.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reviewed the conviction of Joseph Barrientos for "Double Robbery with Rape" under Article 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code, initially sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*. The Court **modified** the judgment, finding Barrientos guilty beyond reasonable doubt of **two counts of rape** under Article 335 (qualified by the use of a deadly weapon) and a **separate crime of robbery** under Article 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code.  He was sentenced to two *reclusion perpetua* terms for the rapes and an indeterminate sentence for the robbery. The Court also ordered Barrientos to pay civil indemnity of P100,000.00 for the rape and restore the P100.00 taken from the victim.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):**
    *   **Article 335:** Defines rape and prescribes penalties, including *reclusion perpetua* to death when committed with a deadly weapon.
    *   **Article 294 (5):** Defines Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons-Penalties, leading to penalty of *prision correccional*.

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The accused claimed he would face a double jeopardy by being tried for the same crime twice.

* **Obligation:** Joseph Barrientos is obligated to serve the imposed sentences and pay the mandated indemnities.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilt for two counts of rape and one count of robbery.
*   **Civil Liability:** Obligation to pay P100,000.00 indemnity for the rape and to restore the P100.00 stolen.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Complaint:** The appellant challenged the validity of the complaint signed by the Chief of Police rather than the victim herself. The Court, citing *People vs. Sangil*, held that the victim's sworn statement complemented the Chief's complaint and satisfied the legal definition. Further, the court asserted the challenge to the complaint came too late and should have been included in a motion.

*   **Admissibility of Confession:** The appellant argued that testimony about him asking for forgiveness was inadmissible because it violated his right to counsel during custodial investigation. The Court rejected this, stating it was a spontaneous utterance, not a confession elicited through questioning, and no written or formal statement was ever presented as evidence.

*   **Identification of the Accused:** The appellant contested the identification, citing inconsistencies and the initial masking of the perpetrator. The Court affirmed the trial court's finding that the complainant's familiarity with specific physical features (scar, eyes, voice) constituted adequate identification, and that the alibi does not succeed in showing he was not present at the scene of the crime.

*   **Recharacterization of Crime:** The original information charged "Double Robbery with Rape" under Article 294(2), a special complex crime. However, the Supreme Court found that the primary intent was rape, with robbery as an afterthought. This allowed the Court to convict Barrientos of two separate counts of rape and one of robbery, despite the original charge.  This required navigating complexities regarding potentially conflicting penalties between Article 294(2) and Article 335, ultimately resolved by applying Article 335.
