**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Ramon Regalario, et al.* G.R. No. 174483, March 31, 2009 (601 Phil. 716)

**Summary:** Automatic review of a CA decision affirming with modification the RTC's conviction of Ramon, Marciano, Sotero, Bienvenido, and Noel Regalario for murder, qualified by abuse of superior strength and scoffing at the body of the victim. The CA modified the penalty from *reclusion perpetua* to death, and added exemplary damages. The Supreme Court affirms the conviction but reduces the penalty to *reclusion perpetua* due to RA 9346 (prohibition of death penalty) and adjusts the monetary awards.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, with qualifying circumstances of treachery, abuse of superior strength, and scoffing at the victim's corpse, conspiracy.
*   **Facts:** The accused, all barangay officials/relatives, attacked Rolando Sevilla with nightsticks and a knife. The victim was tied up after being incapacitated. Conflicting accounts: Accused claim self-defense/denial.
*   **Self-Defense (Ramon Regalario):** Rejected. The court ruled that the unlawful aggression ceased, and Ramon became the aggressor.  The nature and extent of victim's injuries (multiple stab wounds, lacerations) contradicted the claim. *Cf. People v. Cajurao*, G.R. No. 122767, January 20, 2004, 420 SCRA 207, 214-215.
*   **Conspiracy:** Established by the coordinated actions of the accused. Direct proof not required; inferred from the acts. Act of one is the act of all. *People v. Cawaling*, G.R. No. 117970, July 28, 1998, 293 SCRA 267, 306-307.
*   **Abuse of Superior Strength:** Upheld. Accused took advantage of their numbers and weapons (*bahi* sticks and knife) to inflict disproportionate force. *People v. Tumanon, et al.*, G.R. No. 135066, February 15, 2001, 351 SCRA 676, 689.
*   **Scoffing at Corpse:** Upheld. Tying the victim "hog-style" after he was immobilized constituted outrage of the corpse.
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Rejected. The accused surrendered after multiple alias warrants of arrest were issued and did not spontaneously surrender. *People v. Maalat*, G.R. No. 109814, July 8, 1997, 275 SCRA 206, 213-214.

**Obligations:**

*   The accused are jointly and severally liable to pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages to the heirs of the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for murder: sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* (due to RA 9346).
*   Civil liability: Joint and several payment of damages.

**Damages:**

*   Civil indemnity: P75,000.00
*   Moral damages: P75,000.00
*   Exemplary damages: P30,000.00
*   Interest: 6% on all damages from the date of judgment until fully paid (People v. Guevarra, G. R. No. 182191, October 29, 2008).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **No Parole:** The sentence of *reclusion perpetua* is without eligibility for parole.
*   **Joint and Several Liability:** Each accused is fully liable for the entire amount of the damages.
*   **Further Appeals:** While the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, the defense could explore avenues for a motion for reconsideration based on factual or legal arguments.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None explicitly identified, though the factual issues surrounding Ramon's self-defense claim were heavily contested, but ultimately dismissed.
