## Legal Document Summary: *Hon. Lourdes R. Jose vs. Tigerway Facilities and Resources, Inc.*

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a CTA En Banc Decision affirming the RTC's order to refund erroneously paid local business taxes.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CTA En Banc erred in upholding the refund of PHP 485,195.01 to Tigerway, focusing on the applicability of Sections 195 and 196 of the Local Government Code (LGC).

**Facts:**

*   Tigerway paid local business taxes to Caloocan City after an initial assessment and later paid a reduced deficiency assessment due to alleged misrepresentations regarding their business.
*   Tigerway filed a claim for refund, arguing the additional assessments lacked factual and legal basis.
*   City Treasurer argued Tigerway failed to protest the assessment within 60 days per Sec. 195 LGC, rendering the assessment final and barring a claim under Sec. 196 LGC.
*   Lower courts ruled in favor of Tigerway, finding the notices of assessment invalid due to lack of factual and legal basis and that the subsequent documents also failed to support the assessment, leading to the applicability of Section 196 of the LGC.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition. The Court affirmed the refund, but **modified it to remove the legal interest award**. The court emphasized that it is not a trier of facts and confined its review to errors of law.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Sec. 195 LGC (Protest of Assessment):** The Court found this section *inapplicable* because the notices of assessment issued by the City Treasurer were deemed *invalid* as they lacked the required factual and legal basis. The Supreme Court references *Yamane v. BA Lepanto Condominium Corporation, 510 Phil. 750 (2005)* and *National Power Corporation v. Province of Pampanga, G.R. No. 230648, October 6, 2021*, highlighting the requirement that assessment notices provide sufficient information to apprise the taxpayer of the legal basis for the tax. The Court emphasizes that failing to sufficiently inform the taxpayer of the bases for the assessment, including the nature, amount, and rationale, renders the assessment void.
*   **Sec. 196 LGC (Claim for Refund of Tax Credit):** Because the assessment was deemed invalid, the Court found this section applicable. Tigerway complied with the requirements of filing a written claim for refund with the local treasurer and initiating a court proceeding within two years of payment, citing *Metro Manila Shopping Mecca Corp. v. Toledo, 710 Phil. 375 (2013).*
*   **Interest on Tax Refunds:** The Court **reversed** the award of legal interest on the refund. It states legal interest is only permissible when authorized by law or if the tax collection was arbitrary, citing *Atlas Fertilizer Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 188 Phil. 546 (1980)* and *Philex Mining Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 365 Phil. 572 (1999).* Arbitrariness was not found, and no legal basis for the interest was presented.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **City Treasurer:** Obligated to refund PHP 485,195.01 to Tigerway. Liable for erroneous tax collection due to invalid assessments.
*   **Tigerway:** Entitled to a refund due to the City Treasurer's failure to issue valid assessment notices.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Notice of Assessment:** The central point of contention. The case reinforces the critical importance of clearly stating the factual and legal basis for tax assessments in the notice itself. General references or vague allegations are insufficient. Failure to meet this standard can invalidate the assessment and expose the LGU to refund claims.
*   **Remedies under LGC:** Illustrates the distinction between remedies under Sections 195 and 196 LGC. When a valid assessment exists, Section 195 applies and a timely protest is crucial. If an assessment is invalid or absent, Section 196 governs refund claims.

**Case Law:**

*   *City of Manila v. Cosmos Bottling Corporation, 834 Phil. 371 (2018)* - Comprehensive discussion of Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC.
*   *International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. City of Manila, 842 Phil. 173 (2018)* - Reiterates guidelines for tax protest and refunds under the LGC.
*   *Yamane v. BA Lepanto Condominium Corporation, 510 Phil. 750 (2005)* - Clarifies requirements for a valid notice of assessment.
*   *National Power Corporation v. Province of Pampanga, G.R. No. 230648, October 6, 2021* - Significance of informing the taxpayer of the factual and legal basis for assessment.

**Statutory References:**

*   Local Government Code (LGC), Sections 195 and 196.

**Ambiguity:**

While the ruling clarifies the distinction between remedies under Sections 195 and 196, the specific level of detail required in a notice of assessment to satisfy the "factual and legal basis" requirement remains somewhat subjective. The absence of clear guidelines may lead to future disputes.
