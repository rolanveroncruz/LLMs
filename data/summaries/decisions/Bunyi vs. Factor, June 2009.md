## Legal Document Summary: Bunyi v. Factor, G.R. No. 172547 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court decision, which in turn affirmed a Metropolitan Trial Court decision in a **Forcible Entry (Ejectment) case** under Rule 70 of the Rules of Court.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over the possession of a rest house within the Factor family compound in Las Piñas City.
*   **Plaintiff (Respondent):** Fe S. Factor, claiming prior possession as a co-owner of the property, inherited from her father Enrique Factor, whose share was carved out of a larger registered landholding of Constantino Factor and Maura Mayuga-Factor.
*   **Defendants (Petitioners):** Precy Bunyi (widow of Ruben Labao) and Mila Bunyi (her mother), claiming possession as Precy's inheritance from Ruben Labao.
*   **MTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Factor, ordering Bunyis to vacate, pay rent (P2,000/month from Dec 1, 2002), and attorney's fees.
*   **RTC & CA Affirmance:** Affirmed the MTC decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA decision, *modified* to delete the award of rentals and attorney's fees.

**Obligations:**

*   Bunyis are obligated to vacate the premises.
*   [Original MTC ruling for Bunyis] obligation to pay rent was *deleted*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Bunyis liable for the unlawful deprivation of possession of the property from Factor.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Litigation:** The decision explicitly states that the determination of ownership is provisional for the ejectment case and does not preclude a separate action for quieting of title, per *Booc v. Five Star Marketing Co., Inc., G.R. No. 157806, November 22, 2007*. This leaves open the possibility of further litigation regarding the underlying ownership of the property.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 70 of the Rules of Court (Forcible Entry):** Central to the case, governing the elements and procedure for ejectment actions. The Court cited *Bañes v. Lutheran Church in the Philippines, G.R. No. 142308, November 15, 2005* and *David v. Cordova, G.R. No. 152992, July 28, 2005* to elaborate on the meaning of "force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth".
*   **Civil Code Art. 484 (Co-ownership):** Cited in relation to Factor's rights as a co-owner after the death of Gloria Factor-Labao.
*   **Prior Possession (de facto) and not ownership (de jure) is the only issue for resolution.** Cases cited to support this position include *Somodio v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 82680, August 15, 1994* and *Reyes v. Sta. Maria, No. L-33213, June 29, 1979*.
*   **Lack of Supporting Evidence for Rental Award:** Court relied on *Badillo v. Tayag, G.R. Nos. 143976 and 145846, April 3, 2003* and *Herrera v. Bollos, G.R. No. 138258, January 18, 2002*, stating reasonable amount of rent can not be determined by mere judicial notice but needs to have supporting evidence.
*   **Requirement for explicit statement for award of attorney's fees:** Court relied on *Del Rosario v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118325, January 29, 1997* and *Scott Consultants & Resource Development Corporation, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112916, March 16, 1995*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Determination of prior possession:** While the Court found Factor's predecessors had prior possession due to land registration and ownership history, Bunyi's claim hinged on her marriage to Labao and subsequent occupation. This points to a factual dispute regarding the nature and duration of each party's possession.
*   **Constructive Possession:** Whether Factor's occasional visits and the actions of her predecessors-in-interest were sufficient to establish continuous possession under the law. The Court relies on *Dela Rosa v. Carlos, G.R. No. 147549, October 23, 2003* and *Roales v. Director of Lands, 51 Phil. 302, 304 (1927)* to address this point.

**Overall:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' finding of forcible entry based on Factor's established ownership history and the Bunyis' failure to convincingly prove prior possession. However, the deletion of the rental and attorney's fees awards, coupled with the caveat regarding a potential action for quieting of title, indicates some reservations or at least a recognition of the complexities surrounding the underlying ownership claims.
