## Legal Document Summary - *Republic v. Marcos II & Marcos, 612 Phil. 355 (2009)*

**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines v. Ferdinand R. Marcos II and Imelda R. Marcos*, G.R. Nos. 130371 & 130855, August 4, 2009.

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a petition questioning the Regional Trial Court (RTC)'s order granting letters testamentary to Ferdinand R. Marcos II and Imelda R. Marcos as executors of the estate of Ferdinand E. Marcos.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Probate of Will:** The RTC admitted the Last Will and Testament of Ferdinand E. Marcos to probate and granted letters testamentary to the respondents.
*   **Disqualification of Executors:** The Republic argued that the respondents were incompetent to serve as executors due to lack of integrity and convictions for offenses involving moral turpitude (Rule 78, Section 1(c) of the Rules of Court).
*   **CA Dismissal:** The Court of Appeals (CA) dismissed the Republic's petition because the Republic availed the wrong mode of appeal when it filed a direct appeal on questions of fact and law to the Supreme Court when it should have been filed with the CA.

**Obligations:**

*   **Executors' Duty:**  If the RTC Order is implemented (Letters testamentary are issued), the respondents have the legal duty to administer the Marcos estate according to the will and the law. (Ozeata v. Pecson, 93 Phil. 420 (1953)).
*   **BIR Commissioner Vinzons-Chato:** Liable as Special Administratrix until the new appointment of a special administrator to the estate.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of Executors:** Potential breach of fiduciary duty if the estate is not administered properly. (Not explicit but implied).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Respondents' Disqualification:** The Republic's argument that the respondents should be disqualified from acting as executors because of criminal convictions. The SC holds failure to file an income tax return, even if affirmed on appeal, is *not* a crime involving moral turpitude.
*   **Lost Will:** The Republic argues that respondents had previously denied the existence and validity of the Marcos Will.
*   **Hierarchy of Courts:** The Republic's failure to follow the hierarchy of courts by appealing directly to the Supreme Court.
*   **Marcos Assets in Swiss Banks:** The Republic alleged that the Respondents have obstructed the transfer to the Philippines of Marcos assets deposited in Swiss Banks.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Consideration and Adjudication on the Merits or any other action as it may deem appropriate"** - The SC resolution referring the case to the CA gives the CA broad discretion, which was interpreted to allow dismissal based on improper remedy.
*   **"In the opinion of the court unfit to execute the duties of trust"** (Rule 78, Section 1(c)) - This leaves room for judicial discretion in determining whether a person is unfit to serve as an executor.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA's dismissal, primarily based on procedural grounds (improper mode of appeal). However, the Court also addressed the substantive issues raised by the Republic and found no basis to disqualify the respondents as executors. The RTC is ordered to issue the letters testamentary.
