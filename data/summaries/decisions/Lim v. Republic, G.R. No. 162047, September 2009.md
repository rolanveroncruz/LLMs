**Legal Document Summary: *Lim v. Republic*, G.R. Nos. 158630 & 162047**

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review of CA decisions reversing RTC grant of applications for registration of title under P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) and Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act).

**Facts:** Joyce Lim sought registration of two parcels of land based on purchase and alleged continuous, open, exclusive, and notorious possession by her and predecessors-in-interest for over 30 years. The Republic opposed. The RTC initially granted the applications, but the CA reversed, citing failure to meet the 30-year possession requirement.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Applicable Laws:** P.D. 1529, Section 14(1) and C.A. 141, Section 48(b), both requiring open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of alienable and disposable land under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.  The Court acknowledged the difference, emphasizing that PD1529 contemplates a title needing confirmation while CA 141 presumes State ownership.
*   **Alienable and Disposable Status:** The land was only classified as alienable and disposable on March 15, 1982, as per CENRO certifications. This is fatal to claims under both statutes because neither requirements were met.
*   **Possession Requirement:** The Court found insufficient evidence of possession satisfying the statutory criteria (open, continuous, exclusive, notorious) commencing on or before June 12, 1945.
*   **Evidence:** Destura's testimony was deemed hearsay and lacking specifics regarding actual occupancy and dominion. Tax declarations issued in 1991/1994 were considered weak evidence as there was no showing of tax payments before these years. Reliance on Exhibits "R-5" to "R-9-D" pertaining to a lot located in "Biluso" also contributed to insufficient proof of ownership and possession.

**Holding:**

*   Petitions denied. CA decisions affirmed.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Applicant bears the burden of proving compliance with all requirements for land registration under P.D. 1529 or C.A. 141. Failure to do so results in denial of the application.
*   The Republic has no affirmative obligations other than presenting counter-evidence and legal arguments.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Hearsay Evidence:** Over-reliance on testimony without concrete evidence of possession and ownership can be detrimental.
*   **Contradictory Evidence:** Submitting evidence indicating recent classification as alienable/disposable can undermine claims based on possession since 1945.
*   **Ambiguity of "and/or"**: While the RTC decided on the basis of the Public Land Act "and/or" the Property Registration Decree, the Court clarifies the distinct operation of each law, specifically concerning title confirmation versus presumption of state ownership.
*   **Classification vs. Patrimonial Property:** The Court clarified that the classification of the lots as alienable and disposable lands of the public domain does not change its status as properties of the public dominion.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14(1):** Defines who may apply for registration of title.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 141 (Public Land Act), Section 48(b):** Concerns confirmation of imperfect titles.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1073:** Amends Section 48 (b) of C.A. 141 to make June 12, 1945 as the cut-off date.
*   **Civil Code, Articles 420 & 422**: Clarifies that properties of public dominion can be classified but not yet become Patrimonial properties to start prescription for acquisition of property of the public dominion.
*   *Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals and Naguit*, G.R. No. 144057, January 17, 2005, 489 Phil. 405:  Addresses requirements for proving alienable and disposable status.
*   *Republic v. Alconaba*, 471 Phil. 607 (2004): Defines possession and occupation for land registration purposes.
*   *Republic v. Herbieto*, G.R. No. 156117, May 26, 2005, 459 SCRA 183: Discusses the distinction between Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act and Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree.

**Conclusion:**

The case underscores the importance of establishing both the alienable/disposable status of the land *and* continuous, open, exclusive, and notorious possession since June 12, 1945, to successfully claim title under either P.D. 1529 or C.A. 141. It also highlights the need for credible, specific evidence of possession, not merely general assertions or hearsay.
