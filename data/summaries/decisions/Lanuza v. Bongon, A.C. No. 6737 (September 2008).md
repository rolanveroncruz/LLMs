**Case:** *Flocerfida S. Lanuzo v. Atty. Jesus B. Bongon*, A.C. No. 6737, September 23, 2008 (587 Phil. 658)

**Summary:** Disbarment complaint against Atty. Bongon for falsification of public document and violation of notarial rules arising from notarization of a Deed of Sale.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Factual Background:** Complainant alleged Atty. Bongon notarized a Deed of Sale where one of the vendors, Primitiva Nangyo, was already deceased at the time of notarization (died August 10, 1997, deed notarized April 20, 2004). The property descriptions in different versions of the deed were also inconsistent.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Atty. Bongon claimed he did not prepare the deed, it was presented to him by Librada Santos, and he did not conspire to falsify it.
*   **IBP Report & Recommendation (Approved by Supreme Court):** Found Atty. Bongon violated notarial law by failing to ascertain the identities of the parties, specifically failing to discover that Primitiva Nangyo was deceased. No finding of conspiracy to falsify. Recommended suspension and disqualification from being a notary public.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   **Duty to Ascertain Identities:** Notary public must ensure the individuals signing a document are the same persons who executed it and personally appeared before them. This duty is intended to verify the genuineness of signatures and ensure the document is the party's free act.
*   **Duty of Diligence:** Lawyers commissioned as notaries public must discharge their duties with fidelity due to public policy and interest.
*   **Adherence to Notarial Rules:** Notarization is not a mere routine act; it requires strict adherence to requirements to maintain public confidence in notarized documents.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Revocation of notarial commission, disqualification from being commissioned as notary public for two (2) years, and suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year.
*   **Grounds for Discipline:** Engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct due to failure to diligently perform notarial functions.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Conspiracy Finding:** While the Court agreed there was insufficient evidence to hold him liable for conspiracy, the mere act of notarizing a document with a deceased person raises questions about due diligence.
*   **Duty of Inquiry:** The case implies a duty of inquiry beyond simply accepting the document at face value. A prudent notary would have verified the status of the parties, potentially through ID or other means, especially when inconsistencies arose regarding dates and property descriptions.
*   **Impact of Inconsistent Document Versions:** Though not the basis of the liability directly, the inconsistencies in the Deeds of Sale further suggest a lack of proper investigation by the notary.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Lopena v. Cabatos, A.C. No. 3441, August 11, 2005, 466 SCRA 419, 426:** Cited regarding the purpose of notarization (verification of signatures and free act of parties)
*   **Gonzales v. Ramos, A.C. No. 6649, June 21, 2005, 460 SCRA 352:** Cited regarding unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.
*   **Implied:** Relevant provisions of the Notarial Law are implicated, concerning the duties and responsibilities of notaries public.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the critical importance of a notary public's due diligence in verifying the identities of parties and ensuring the validity of documents before notarization. Atty. Bongon's failure to ascertain the death of one of the vendors resulted in disciplinary action, underscoring the serious consequences of neglecting these essential duties. This ruling reinforces the need for notaries to go beyond mere formalities and actively investigate the authenticity of documents presented to them, especially where red flags or inconsistencies are present.
