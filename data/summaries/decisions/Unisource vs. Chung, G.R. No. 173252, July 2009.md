Here's a summary of the provided decision in *Unisource Commercial and Development Corporation v. Joseph Chung, Kiat Chung and Kleto Chung*, G.R. No. 173252, July 17, 2009:

**Case Summary:**

Unisource (Petitioner), owner of a servient estate (TCT No. 176253), sought to cancel a recorded voluntary easement of right of way in favor of the dominant estate owned by the Chungs (Respondents) based on the premise that there is a suitable access to a public road through Matienza St. The RTC initially dismissed the petition, then granted it after reconsideration and ocular inspection. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the easement was voluntary and not subject to extinguishment by mere existence of an alternative outlet. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Voluntary Easement:**  The central issue is the existence and enforceability of a voluntary easement of right of way annotated on Unisource's title, originally established by a 1924 court order declaring the right of Francisco Hidalgo y Magnifico to pass through the land now owned by Unisource.
*   **No Cancellation:** A crucial element is that voluntary easements, unlike legal easements, are not automatically extinguished by the existence of another adequate outlet, according to Article 631(3) of the Civil Code.
*   **Binding on Heirs/Assigns:**  The absence of explicit mention of "heirs or assigns" in the original annotation does not render the easement personal.  Voluntary easements are generally binding on the parties, their heirs, and assigns, unless otherwise stipulated or due to the nature of the contract (Article 1311 of the Civil Code).
*   **Indivisibility of Easement:**  Subdivision of the dominant estate does not extinguish the easement (Art. 618). Each co-owner can use the easement, as long as they do not modify it or make it more burdensome.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Unisource's Ongoing Obligation:** Unisource remains obligated to respect and maintain the easement for the benefit of the Chungs' property. Failure to do so could lead to legal action, including injunctions and potential damages.
*   **No Unjust Enrichment:** The Court found that the easement did not constitute unjust enrichment to the Chungs' part because it was originally an agreed upon right.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** The decision heavily relies on the distinction between legal and voluntary easements under the Civil Code, specifically Article 631(3) regarding extinguishment of easements and Article 1311 regarding contracts generally binding on the parties, their heirs and assigns. Article 618 pertaining to Indivisibility of Easements.
*   **City of Manila v. Entote, No. L-24776, June 28, 1974, 57 SCRA 497:**  Distinguished as factually inapplicable, as that case concerned the scope of intended beneficiaries of the easement, unlike this case where binding force of the easement over heirs or assigns.
*   **La Vista Association, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 95252, September 5, 1997, 278 SCRA 498:** Confirmed that the presence of an adequate outlet to a highway extinguishes only legal or compulsory easements, not voluntary easements
*   **Purugganan v. Paredes, No. L-23818, January 21, 1976, 69 SCRA 69, 77-78:** Registration of the servient estate without annotating the easement extinguished such right.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The absence of express language in the original annotation specifying that the easement binds "heirs and assigns" of both the servient and dominant estate owners was the crux of Unisource's argument. The Court rejected this argument.
