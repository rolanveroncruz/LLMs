## Legal Document Summary: Viray v. Court of Appeals and Chua (G.R. No. 120760, February 24, 1998)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the validity of an amended writ of execution issued by the Clerk of Court without a prior court order.  The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, holding that the amended writ was void because the Clerk of Court lacked the authority to unilaterally amend it, particularly to increase the amount to be executed. The case highlights the distinction between the judicial act of ordering execution and the ministerial act of issuing the writ (citing *Hidalgo v. Crossfield*, 17 Phil. 466 (1910)).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Compromise Agreement:** The original obligation arose from a compromise agreement between Pacita Viray (Petitioner) and the Pinlac spouses, obligating them to pay P160,000 in installments, with an acceleration clause for default.
*   **Writ of Execution:**  Initial Writ was for P57,500, based on Petitioner's (incorrect) motion.  The subsequent amended Writ increased the amount to P157,500.
*   **Notice of Levy:** The Notice of Levy was annotated on the title but stated the original amount (P57,500).
*   **Tender of Payment & Consignation:** Respondent Johnson Chua tendered the amount stated in the initial Writ, but it was rejected. He subsequently consigned the amount with court approval.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Liability:** Petitioner bore the fault for the incorrect amount stated in the initial motion for execution.  Risk of not recovering the full debt from the Pinlac spouses on the Chua Property
*   **Respondent Chua's Exposure:** While initially exposed due to the levy, he successfully argued against the validity of the amended writ and satisfied the initially levied amount.
*   **Risk to Subsequent Purchasers:** Highlights the importance of accurate information on Notices of Levy and the extent to which purchasers are expected to investigate underlying claims.
*	**Petitioner could potentially still collect the money from the Pinlac spouses

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Hidalgo v. Crossfield (17 Phil. 466 (1910))**: Distinguished between the judicial act of awarding an execution and the ministerial act of issuing it.
*   **Rule 136, Sec. 4, Rules of Court:** Defines the duties of the Clerk of Court.
*   **Pacific Mills v. NLRC (G.R. No. 88864, 17 January 1990, 181 SCRA 130)**: Only the judge is vested with authority to amend the order for the writ.
*	**Vda. de Dimayuga v. Raymundo, 76 Phil. 143 (1946); Arambulo v. CFI of Laguna, 53 Phil. 302 (1929); Philippine Reconstruction Corp., Inc. v. Aparente, No. L-26630, 30 May 1972, 45 SCRA 217:** These cases were all cited at the end of the legal document to state that the petitioner can exercise whatever rights she may have under the law and undertake the appropriate step for the enforcement of such rights or the execution of the compromise judgment rendered by the RTC - Br. 43, Dagupan City, in her favor on 8 November 1998 against the Pinlac spouses

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Clerical Error vs. Substantive Amendment:** The petitioner argued that the amendment was merely to correct a clerical error. The Court rejected this, holding that the Clerk of Court still requires a court order for any amendment, especially one changing the amount to be levied.
*   **Buyer in Bad Faith:** Petitioner's claim that Chua was a buyer in bad faith was rejected. Chua was entitled to rely on the amount stated in the Notice of Levy.

**Legal Precision Points:**

*   The Court emphasized that a writ of execution must strictly conform to the underlying judgment/order.
*   The Clerk of Court's duties are ministerial, not judicial, and she cannot usurp judicial functions.
*   A purchaser of property is not obligated to investigate beyond the records in the Registry of Deeds.

**Overall:** The case serves as a cautionary tale regarding the importance of accuracy in initial pleadings for execution and the limited authority of the Clerk of Court in amending writs. It also clarifies the rights of purchasers relying on the amounts stated in public records.
