## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Rogelio Marcelo & Milagros Marcelo vs. Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB)* (G.R. No. 182735, December 4, 2009)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the validity of PCIB's extra-judicial foreclosure and subsequent public auction sale of properties owned by Sps. Marcelo. The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately denied the petition.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage (REM):** Spouses Marcelo executed an REM to secure multiple promissory notes/loans (totaling Php3,990,000.00, and subsequent obligations.) over six parcels of land in Baliuag, Bulacan. The REM contained a standard foreclosure clause (Act 3135, as amended) upon default. The REM also stipulated 15% attorney's fees in case of foreclosure.
*   **Promissory Notes:** Several promissory notes were executed between 1996 and 1997 with specific principal amounts and maturity dates. The spouses acknowledged the interest rates and charges in the Disclosure Statement.
*   **Obligation to Pay:** Sps. Marcelo had the obligation to pay the loans according to the promissory notes and the terms of the REM. Default triggered PCIB's right to foreclose.
*   **Posting and Publication of Notice of Sale:** The notice was posted on Meralco posts in public locations and published in "The Times Newsweekly," a newspaper of general circulation in Bulacan. PCIB argued this complied with Act No. 3135.
*   **Extra-judicial Foreclosure:** PCIB initiated extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings after Sps. Marcelo defaulted.

**Liabilities & Breaches:**

*   **Default:** Sps. Marcelo defaulted on their loan payments.
*   **PCIB:** Sps Marcelo alleged breach of contract by PCIB due to exorbitant and unnotified interest rates and charges. The Court rejected this.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Posting & Publication Compliance (Act No. 3135):** Spouses Marcelo challenged the validity of the foreclosure based on non-compliance with posting and publication requirements of Act No. 3135. Specifically, they argued that posting on Meralco posts was inadequate, and that the circulation of "The Times Newsweekly" was too minimal to qualify it as a newspaper of general circulation. Lower court initially agreed that the postings were not adequate and that the publication in the Times Newsweekly was insufficient to meet the publication requirement because it was a tabloid with few stale news items, and commanded very minimal readership. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the order, and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed that the postings were adequate, and the "The Times Newsweekly" was a newspaper of general circulation despite its smaller size.
*   **Interest Rates & Charges:** Spouses Marcelo alleged that the interest rates and bank charges were excessive and unilaterally imposed. The Court rejected this argument, referring to the signed disclosure statements acknowledging the rates.
*   **Motion for Extension of Time:** Spouses Marcelo's late filing of a Motion for Reconsideration in the Court of Appeals was fatal to their case. The Court of Appeals rejected their Motion for Extension of Time to File a Motion for Reconsideration. The Supreme Court agreed that after the finality of judgment, it can no longer be disturbed, altered, or modified.
*   **Laches:** Initially, the trial court agreed with PCIB's assertion of laches, stating that the action was a much-delayed afterthought. This point became less critical as the courts ultimately ruled in favor of the bank on the merits.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (as amended by Act No. 4118):** Governs extra-judicial foreclosure. Specifically, Section 3 dictates notice requirements.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1079:** Governs publication of notices.
*   **Republic Act No. 3765 (Truth in Lending Act):** Compliance evidenced by disclosure statements.
*   ***Olizon v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 107075, 1 September 1994, 236 SCRA 148):** Cited by trial court, states that the lack of personal notice to the mortgagors is not a ground to set aside the foreclosure sale.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. International Corporate Bank* (G.R. 86679, 23 July 1991, 199 SCRA 508):** Cited by trial court, reiterating that the law does not require that a personal notice of the auction sale be given to the mortgagor.
*   ***Habaluyas Enterprises, Inc. v. Maximo M. Japson* (226 Phil. 144, 147-148 (1986)):** Ruled that interest of justice would be better served if the ruling in the original decision were applied prospectively from the time herein stated.
*   ***Basa v. Mercado* (61 Phil. 632, 635 (1935)):** To be a newspaper of general circulation, it is enough that it is published for the dissemination of local news and general information; that it has a bona fide subscription list of paying subscribers; and that it is published at regular intervals.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "general circulation" requirement of "The Times Newsweekly" was heavily disputed.  The SC ultimately upheld its qualification based on the publisher's affidavit and lack of evidence proving the circulation to be *de minimis*. The lower courts initially disagreed with this.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the validity of the extra-judicial foreclosure sale. The court found that PCIB substantially complied with the notice requirements of Act No. 3135 and that the case had already reached finality due to the spouses Marcelo's procedural lapses. The Court's decision emphasizes the importance of adhering to procedural rules and honoring contractual obligations.
