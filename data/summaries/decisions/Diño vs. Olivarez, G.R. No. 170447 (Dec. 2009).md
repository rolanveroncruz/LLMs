## Legal Document Summary: *Diño v. Olivarez*, G.R. No. 170447 (2009)

**Nature of Document:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration in an election offense case (vote buying) under Section 261(a), in relation to (b), Article XXII of the Omnibus Election Code.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Bienvenido Diño and Renato Comparativo (complainants)
*   **Respondent:** Pablo Olivarez (accused)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC Authority:** Affirms COMELEC's exclusive power to investigate and prosecute election offenses (Sec. 265, Omnibus Election Code) and delegate such authority to prosecuting arms of the government (Sec. 2, Rule 34, COMELEC Rules of Procedure). This delegation can be revoked expressly or impliedly.
*   **Delegated Authority:** City Prosecutors are deputies of COMELEC, bound by COMELEC directives. Acting contrary to COMELEC orders constitutes exceeding delegated authority.
*   **Suspension of Authority:** A directive from the COMELEC Law Department to transmit case records and suspend implementation of a resolution pending appeal effectively SUSPENDS the City Prosecutor's authority to prosecute.
*   **Trial Court Discretion:** Once a case is filed in court, disposition rests on the court's discretion; however, this discretion is limited when the court is aware that the information was filed ultra vires by the prosecutor.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **City Prosecutor Liability:** Filing amended information after COMELEC suspension order constituted an abuse of authority, rendering the amended information void.  Acts were considered defiance of COMELEC directive.
*   **Judge Liability:** Admitting the amended information and issuing orders based thereon (arrest, confiscation of bond) after being informed of the COMELEC's suspension order constituted grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, invalidating those orders.
*   **Risk of Contempt:** The City Prosecutor's actions could be construed as contempt of the COMELEC's authority.
*   **Risk of Double Jeopardy (Potential):** The initial finding of probable cause was appealed. If the COMELEC had ruled against Olivarez, the amended charges could have been filed. However, that didn't happen.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 261(a):** Vote buying offense.
*   **Omnibus Election Code, Section 265:** COMELEC's power to prosecute election offenses.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Rule 34, Section 2:** Delegation of authority to prosecuting arms.
*   **COMELEC Rules of Procedure, Section 10:** Appeals from Action of State Prosecutor.
*   ***Commission on Elections v. Español*, 463 Phil. 240 (2003):** Cited for COMELEC powers.
*   ***Viudez II v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 152889 (2009):** Addressed the fact that cases in court are left to the discretion of the court.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Revocation" vs. "Suspension":** The initial dispute centered on whether the COMELEC letter constituted a *revocation* or merely a *suspension* of authority. The court initially ruled it was not a revocation, but later reconsidered, stating that the effect was suspension.

**Outcome:**

*   The Motion for Reconsideration was GRANTED.
*   The Court of Appeals decision (CA-G.R. SP No. 89230) was REINSTATED.
*   The amended informations filed by the City Prosecutor were declared VOID and of NO EFFECT.
*   Trial Court's Orders were declared void and of no effect

**Analysis:**

The key takeaway is the importance of respecting the COMELEC's supervisory authority over election offense prosecutions. Local prosecutors must adhere to COMELEC directives, even if they believe a different course of action is warranted. Disregarding these directives can invalidate their actions and expose them to liability.
