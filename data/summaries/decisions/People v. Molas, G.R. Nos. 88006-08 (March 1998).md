**Case Summary: *People v. Molas*, G.R. Nos. 88006-08, March 2, 1998 (350 Phil. 333)**

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the conviction of Gerardo Molas for rape of a minor.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction:** Appellant convicted of rape (Crim. Case No. Q-43222) committed on November 22, 1985. Acquitted in two other rape charges for insufficiency of evidence.
*   **Penalty:**  Reclusion Perpetua and ordered to pay indemnity.
*   **Indemnity:**  Increased from PHP 30,000.00 to PHP 50,000.00.

**Obligations:**

*   Appellant obligated to serve the sentence of Reclusion Perpetua.
*   Appellant obligated to pay PHP 50,000.00 in indemnity to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Appellant held criminally liable for rape under applicable provisions of the Revised Penal Code (though not explicitly cited in the document, the elements of rape as defined therein are present).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** Appellant denied the accusations, claiming alibi and suggesting the complainant's injuries resulted from an accident (fall from stairs). The Court dismissed this claim.
*   **Motive for Fabrication:** Appellant argued that the charges were fabricated due to a prior misunderstanding with the complainantâ€™s family. The Court found this unpersuasive based on the victim's age and credible testimony.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   Implied reference to provisions in the **Revised Penal Code** defining rape.
*   **Case Law Cited Regarding Credibility of Witnesses:** Numerous cases cited regarding the weight given to trial court findings (e.g., *People v. Dinglasan*) and the credibility of child rape victims (e.g., *People v. Cabillan*, *People v. Vitor*).
*   **Case Law Cited Regarding Indemnity Amounts:** *People v. Romua* et al. This sets precedent for increasing the indemnity amount.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses (if any):**

*   None apparent. The decision is clear in its reasoning and application of the law.

**Legal Analysis:**

The Court relied heavily on the complainant's testimony and the medical evidence to support its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized the complainant's age and consistency in her testimony.  The defense's arguments, including the alleged accident and motive for fabrication, were effectively refuted. The decision confirms that the Court places significant weight on the testimony of child victims in sexual assault cases, particularly when corroborated by medical evidence.
