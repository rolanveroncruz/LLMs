## Legal Document Summary: *Alexander Tam Wong v. Catherine Factor-Koyama*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari concerning a default order and denial of a motion to dismiss in a specific performance, sum of money, and damages case (Civil Case No. C-21860) before the RTC Caloocan City.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Specific Performance Claim:** Koyama alleges Wong refused to execute a deed of absolute sale for a condominium unit.
*   **Service of Summons:** The core issue is the validity of the substituted service of summons on Wong. The Sheriff's Return indicates attempts at personal service at Wong's residence, followed by leaving the summons with the caretaker who refused to acknowledge/receive.
*   **Default Order:** Wong was declared in default for failure to file an answer. He claims he was not properly served with summons.
*   **Motion to Dismiss:** Wong filed a Motion to Dismiss asserting lack of jurisdiction due to improper service of summons. The RTC denied the motion, finding valid substituted service.
*   **CA's Dismissal:** The Court of Appeals dismissed Wong's Petition for Certiorari, holding it was an improper remedy. The CA stated Wong should have availed of remedies for a default order as stated in *Cerezo v. Tuazon* (motion to set aside, motion for new trial, petition for relief, or appeal). The CA also stated that the denial of a motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order and is not a proper subject of a petition for certiorari.

**Obligations:**

*   **Defendant (Wong):** Obligation to answer the complaint within the prescribed period if validly served with summons.
*   **Sheriff:** Obligation to effect personal service if practicable, and if not, to meticulously comply with the requirements for valid substituted service under Section 7, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court, as discussed in *Spouses Jose v. Spouses Boyon*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Wong was ordered by the RTC to pay Koyama Php2,204,000.00 with legal rate of interest, attorney's fees, appearance fees, and costs of suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The validity of the service of summons is crucial as it affects the RTC's jurisdiction over Wong's person. Improper service renders the subsequent judgment potentially void.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:** Even with defective service, the SC stated that jurisdiction over Wong's person was acquired when he actively participated in the hearing on 23 January 2009 by cross-examining Koyama.
*   **Final Judgment and Appeal:** The RTC already rendered a judgment against Wong, which he appealed. The SC stated it was unnecessary to still address the issue of whether Wong was improperly declared in default because Wong could raise and include said issue in his appeal of the RTC Decision.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Sections 6 & 7, Revised Rules of Court:** Personal and substituted service of summons.
*   ***Cerezo v. Tuazon*:** Remedies for a party declared in default.
*   ***Spouses Jose v. Spouses Boyon*:** Requirements for valid substituted service.
*   ***Manotoc v. Court of Appeals*:** Diligence required of the sheriff in serving summons.
*   **Rule 14 Section 20, Revised Rules of Court:** Voluntary appearance.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sufficiency of Sheriff's Efforts:** The Sheriff's Return's description of efforts to locate Wong is deemed insufficient by the Court, highlighting the strict scrutiny applied to substituted service.
*   **"Voluntary Appearance":** The application of the doctrine of "voluntary appearance" based on Wong's cross-examination of Koyama.
