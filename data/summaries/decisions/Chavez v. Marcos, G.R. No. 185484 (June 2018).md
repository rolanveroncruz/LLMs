## Legal Document Summary - Chavez v. Marcos (G.R. No. 185484)

**Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Date:** June 27, 2018

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Francisco I. Chavez (deceased, represented by counsel)
*   **Respondent:** Imelda R. Marcos

**Subject Matter:** Assails the Court of Appeals decision dismissing Chavez's Petition for Certiorari and affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) order, which denied the prosecution's motion for inhibition of the presiding judge, Judge Pampilo, in 33 consolidated criminal cases against Imelda Marcos for violations of Central Bank Circular No. 960 in relation to Section 34 of RA 265 (Central Bank Act), related to illicitly maintaining foreign exchange accounts abroad.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Central Bank Circular No. 960, Section 4:** Prohibits unauthorized foreign exchange transactions involving payment, retention, delivery, or transfer of foreign exchange abroad while corresponding pesos are paid or received in the Philippines.
*   **RA 265, Section 34:** Penalizes willful violation of the Central Bank Act or any legally issued order, instruction, rule, or regulation by the Monetary Board.
*   **Rule 137 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the disqualification and inhibition of judges. A judge must not sit in any case in which he, his wife, or child is financially interested as heir, legatee, creditor, or otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record. A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion, disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned above.
*   **Continuous Trial System** (Admin. Circular No. 3-90 and Supreme Court Circular No. 1-89): all trial courts to adopt the mandatory continuous trial system to resolve cases with utmost dispatch, with judicious exercise of the court's power to control the trial to avoid delay.

**Key Allegations:**

*   **Prosecution:** Imelda Marcos, in conspiracy with her late husband, Ferdinand Marcos, violated Central Bank Circular No. 960 by opening and maintaining unauthorized foreign exchange accounts abroad and failing to report foreign exchange earnings.
*   **Chavez (Petitioner):** Judge Pampilo showed bias in favor of Imelda Marcos through scheduling tactics, abruptly terminating Chavez's testimony, orally denying the motion for inhibition, and disregarding the Court of Appeals' injunction. Further claims collusion between Judge Pampilo, Atty Galit, and Atty. Sison, the Defense Lawyer. Claims the promulgation of the RTC decision was irregular.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Potential fines and imprisonment for Imelda Marcos for violating Central Bank regulations.
*   **Risk of Acquittal:** The RTC acquitted Imelda Marcos due to the prosecution's weak evidence, specifically the reliance on hearsay and the failure to properly authenticate documents.
*   **Risk of Judge Sanctions:** Although there was no clear proof of the Judge's bias, such actions, if proven, may lead to sanctions.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Central Bank Circular No. 960, Section 4**
*   **RA 265, Section 34**
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Govern Petition for Review on Certiorari to only pertain to questions of law.
*   **Rule 137, Section 1 of the Rules of Court**
*   **Pimentel v. Salanga:** Outlines the scope of discretion under Rule 137 regarding judge disqualification and reinforces the presumption of judicial impartiality.
*   **People v. Patamama:** Reinforces that hearsay is inadmissable evidence in criminal cases.
*   **Pagoda Philippines, Inc. v. Universal Canning, Inc., 509 Phil. 339 (2005)**
*   **Admin. Circular No. 3-90**
*   **Supreme Court Circular No. 1-89**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Court of Appeals Injunction:** Petitioner argued that the injunction subsisted "pending final resolution" and therefore invalidated the RTC's acquittal. The Court of Appeals held that denial of the Petition for Certiorari carried with it the dissolution of the injunction, thus serving as the "contrary order."
*   **Authority Designation:** Petitioner claims that the RTC Judge misinterpreted the Department of Justice memorandum to improperly designate Atty. Galit as Lead Prosecutor.

**Holding:** Petition for Review on Certiorari is *DENIED*. Court of Appeals Decision affirmed.

**Rationale:**

*   Petition raised questions of fact, which are inappropriate for a Rule 45 petition.
*   The RTC's decision was not issued in violation of the injunction as the injunction was no longer in effect.
*   Insufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that Judge Pampilo would dispense justice impartially. Scheduling, denial of postponement requests, and other actions were within the judge's discretion and consistent with rules on expeditious resolution of cases.

**Additional Notes:** The Supreme Court criticized the prosecution's handling of the case, emphasizing the importance of competent presentation of evidence in high-profile cases involving public funds and cautioning against the soundbite tactics that sacrifice competence. The Supreme Court noted that "Fatal errors that should have been avoided by veteran litigators, such as a habit of postponements and a lack of preparation, cannot be papered over by a labyrinth of appeals that reaches this Court."
