Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Dagot, Jr. v. Spouses Go Cheng Key*, G.R. Nos. 211309 & 211957, October 2, 2024:

**Case Summary**

The Supreme Court consolidated two petitions related to a land dispute originating from an extrajudicial settlement with sale. The core issue is whether the trial court's original decision in favor of the Dagot heirs attained finality due to the respondents' (Spouses Go Cheng Key et al.) failure to timely appeal. The Court also addresses procedural irregularities related to the filing of duplicative petitions and unauthorized representation.

**Key Provisions and Findings**

*   **Unauthorized Petition Expunged:**  The Court expunged G.R. No. 211957 because the petition was filed by Atty. Peneyra without the petitioners' authorization and suffered from procedural defects (lack of service, improper verification, and denial of signature by a petitioner). Dagot, Jr's affidavit and sworn statement are re-docketed as an administrative complaint against Atty. Peneyra.

*   **Finality of Judgment:** The Supreme Court held that the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) initial Decision dated May 19, 2009 in favor of petitioners had reached finality. Respondents’ "Urgent Manifestation" was deemed an unauthorized second motion for reconsideration under Section 5, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court, and thus did not toll the appeal period.  This is crucial because it means the RTC's decision is binding regardless of any potential errors.

*   **Doctrine of Immutability of Judgments upheld:** The court emphasized that due to the judgement being final and executory, it could no longer be altered, amended or modified, even if the alteration, amendment or modification is to correct an erroneous judgment.

*   **Action for Reconveyance:** Lower Courts (CA and RTC) treated the case as an action for reconveyance based on implied trust under Article 1456 of the Civil Code, which prescribes in 10 years from discovery of the mistake or fraud.

*   **Extrajudicial Settlement**: While the Court acknowledged arguments about prescription of the reconveyance action, it ultimately relied on the procedural issue of finality.

*   **Attorney Conduct**: The court levied sanctions against Atty. Peneyra for failure to comply with court orders and potentially unauthorized representation, culminating in an administrative complaint being lodged against him.

**Statutory References and Case Law**

*   **Rule 37, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Prohibiting second motions for reconsideration.
*   **Article 1456, Civil Code:** Implied trust doctrine.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 52:**  Constructive notice upon registration.
*   **Rule 138 Section 26, Rules of Court:** Rules for valid substitution of counsel.
*   **Relevant jurisprudence:**
    *   *Mendizabel v. Apao*, 518 Phil. 17 (2006)
    *   *Lasquite v. Victory Hills*, 608 Phil. 418 (2009)
    *   *Bernardo v. Court of Appeals*, 341 Phil. 413 (1997)
    *   *Elbiña v. Ceniza*, 530 Phil. 183 (2006)
    *   *Heirs of Albano v. Spouses Ravanes*, 790 Phil. 557 (2016)
    *   *Republic v. Heirs of Gotengco*, 824 Phil. 568 (2018)

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities**

*   **Adverse Party Position:** The CA’s reliance on prescription of the action for reconveyance based on implied trust could be a point of contention. While the Supreme Court overturned the CA decision based on procedural rules, it acknowledged that this conclusion was also supported by testimony given by the Register of Deeds of Puerto Princesa City and Dalojo. Respondents may try to leverage that in future proceedings.
*   **Administrative Case Against Attorney:** The disciplinary action against Atty. Peneyra could have implications for the validity of his past actions, although the Supreme Court addressed this by formally confirming that only the first complaint was valid.

**Obligations and Liabilities**

*   Respondents are obligated to comply with the reinstated RTC Decision dated May 19, 2009, which includes surrendering titles for amendment and vacating portions of land.
*   Atty. Peneyra faces potential disciplinary action and administrative penalties.

**Conclusion**

The Supreme Court's decision is primarily based on procedural grounds – the finality of the original RTC decision. While the substantive issues regarding the reconveyance of the land and the alleged mistake in Ebro's title are not fully resolved on their merits, the procedural victory for the Dagot heirs is significant. Respondents are now bound by the RTC's original ruling. The administrative case against Atty. Peneyra adds another layer of complexity to the situation.
