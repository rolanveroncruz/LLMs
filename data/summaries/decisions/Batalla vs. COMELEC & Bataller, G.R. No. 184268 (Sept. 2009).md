## Legal Document Summary - Batalla v. COMELEC

**Case:** *Ernesto Batalla v. Commission on Elections and Teodoro Bataller*, G.R. No. 184268, September 15, 2009.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rules 65 in relation to Rule 64 of the Rules of Court, assailing COMELEC dismissal of appeal in an election protest case.

**Key Issue:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Batalla's appeal due to late payment of appeal fee and failure to verify the Motion for Reconsideration, and if the appeal is given due course, whether the appeal is meritorious.

**Facts:**

*   Batalla and Bataller were candidates for Punong Barangay. Batalla was initially proclaimed winner.
*   Bataller filed an election protest (Election Case No. B-2007-2) alleging misappreciation of ballots.
*   MCTC found a tie, invoking Section 240 of the Omnibus Election Code (BP Blg. 881) on drawing of lots.
*   Batalla appealed to the COMELEC First Division (EAC (BRGY.) No. 89-2008).
*   COMELEC First Division dismissed the appeal due to late payment of the appeal fee, citing Sections 3, 4, Rule 40 and Section 9(a), Rule 22 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   COMELEC En Banc denied Batalla's Motion for Reconsideration due to lack of verification, citing Section 3, Rule 19 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.
*   COMELEC issued an Entry of Judgment.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Section 240, Omnibus Election Code:** Mandates drawing of lots in case of tie, with notice to all tied candidates.
*   **Sections 3 & 4, Rule 40, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Governs payment of appeal fees and deadlines.
*   **Section 9(a), Rule 22, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Failure to pay the correct appeal fee is a ground for the dismissal of the appeal.
*   **Section 3, Rule 19, COMELEC Rules of Procedure:** Requires verification of Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC:** Rules of Procedure in Election Cases before the Courts involving Elective Municipal and Barangay Officials.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 8486:** Clarifying the implementation of COMELEC Rules re: payment of filing fees for appealed cases.

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Dismissal of Appeal:** Failure to strictly comply with the rules regarding payment of appeal fees and deadlines.
*   **Finality of MCTC Decision:** If COMELEC decision stands, the tie vote result and drawing of lots procedure remain in effect.
*   **Challenge to Ballot Appreciation:** Risk of MCTC's ballot appreciation being upheld, maintaining the tie.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Ferrer v. Comelec (G.R. No. 139489):** Application of neighborhood and intent rules.
*   **Velasco v. Commission on Elections (G.R. No. 166931):** Application of neighborhood rule.
*   **Buenaflor v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 142021):** Liberal application of rules on appeal in the interest of substantial justice.
*   **Rodillas v. Comelec (G.R. No. 119055):** Emphasizes timely payment of full appeal fee for perfection of appeal.
*   **Aguilar v. Commission on Elections (G.R. No. 185140):** Clarified payment of appeal fee, superseded by Divinagracia v. Commission on Elections.
*   **Divinagracia v. Commission on Elections (G.R. Nos. 186007 & 186016):** Appellant must pay PhP 1,000 appeal fee to the trial court and the additional PhP 3,200 appeal fee within 15 days from the time of the filing of the Notice of Appeal with the lower court pursuant to Comelec Resolution No. 8486.
*   **Bautista v. Comelec (G.R. No. 133840):** Determination of voter intention.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Interpretation of Rules on Appeal Fees:** Conflicting rules and interpretations on deadlines and amounts for appeal fee payments (A.M. No. 07-4-15-SC vs. COMELEC Rules of Procedure). Later clarified by COMELEC Resolution No. 8486.
*   **Application of Neighborhood and Intent Rules:** Subjective interpretation of voter intent and application of the neighborhood rule in appreciating contested ballots.

**Court Ruling:**

*   **Petition Granted.** The COMELEC Orders are reversed and set aside. Batalla's appeal is given due course. Ernesto Batalla is declared the winner.

**Reasoning:**

*   Batalla perfected his appeal by paying the required fees, as there was confusion in the payment of fees, hence the COMELEC has to clarify the procedural rules on the payment of these appeal fees, and for this purpose issued Comelec Resolution No. 8486 on July 15, 2008.
*   The Court scrutinizes the five (5) contested ballots and only credited three (3) ballots to Bataller, which means that Batalla prevailed by two votes over Bataller.
*   Liberal interpretation of election laws to give effect to voter intent.
*   Reversal of MCTC decision based on re-evaluation of contested ballots.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the COMELEC's decision, finding that the appeal was perfected and that Batalla won based on a re-appreciation of the ballots. This case highlights the importance of adhering to procedural rules but also the court's willingness to apply a liberal construction in election cases to ascertain and give effect to the true will of the electorate. The key takeaway is the clarification on appeal fee payments and the application of the neighborhood and intent rules in ballot appreciation.
