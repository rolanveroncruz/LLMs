## Legal Document Summary: LLDA vs. COA

**Case:** *Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) vs. The Commission on Audit (COA) En Banc*, G.R. No. 211341, November 27, 2018.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging COA Decision No. 2012-129 and Resolution denying reconsideration.

**Key Issue:** Validity of LLDA's grant of allowances (rice subsidy, meal, children, medical, Christmas bonuses, anniversary incentive pay, and year-end economic amelioration) to employees hired after June 30, 1989, in light of R.A. No. 6758 (Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989) and DBM CCC No. 10, its implementing rules.

**Ruling:** Petition dismissed. COA's disallowance of the allowances affirmed. Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) denied.

**Key Provisions & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6758, Sec. 12:** Standardized salary rates. All allowances integrated except: (1) Representation and Transportation Allowance (RATA), (2) Clothing and Laundry, (3) Subsistence (marine officers/crew, hospital personnel), (4) Hazard Pay, (5) Foreign Service, and (6) other allowances DBM determined. This is the central legal issue.
*   **DBM CCC No. 10, Paragraphs 5.5 & 5.6:** Implements R.A. 6758. Lists additional allowances (rice, sugar, medical, etc.) allowed only for incumbents as of June 30, 1989. Discontinued all other allowances from Nov 1, 1989.
*   **Section 16 of RA No. 6758:** Repeals laws, decrees, corporate charters that exempt agencies from the coverage of the System, including P.D. 985. This is the key to why LLDA charter was effectively repealed.
*   **Rules 64 & 65, Rules of Court:** Relates to the petitions for certiorari.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **LLDA:** Obligated to comply with R.A. 6758 after repeal of its corporate charter. Liable for refund of disallowed benefits paid to employees. Has a responsibility to notify the court/tribunal of changes in address to facilitate proper service.
*   **LLDA Employees:** Liable for refund of disallowed benefits.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Non-Publication of DBM CCC No. 10:** LLDA argued that the allowances were valid due to non-publication, citing *De Jesus v. COA* (355 Phil. 584 (1998)). The Court held that while CCC No. 10 was initially ineffective, the allowances were disallowed under Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758, which is self-executing for items (1)-(6).
*   **Good Faith:** LLDA's claim of good faith in granting the benefits was rejected. The court found that R.A. No. 6758 was in effect, negating good faith.
*   **Locus Standi:** The Court questioned LLDA's legal standing to pursue the case, as the monetary injury was sustained by the employees, not the LLDA itself.

**Case Law:**

*   **De Jesus v. Commission on Audit (355 Phil. 584 (1998)):**  Initially deemed DBM CCC No. 10 ineffective due to lack of publication. Overcome by the self-executory nature of certain provisions in RA 6758.
*   **Gutierrez v. Department of Budget and Management (630 Phil. 1, 14 (2010)):** Confirms the interpretation that only items (1) to (6) of Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 are self-executing.
*   **Philippine International Trading Corporation v. Commission on Audit (368 Phil. 478, 491 (1999)):** Repeal of corporate charters that are inconsistent with R.A. No. 6758.
*   **Villegas v. Subido, 148-B Phil. 668, 675-676 (1971):** Interpreting the rules when a special law is effectively repealed.
*   **Australian Professional Realty, Inc. v. Municipality of Padre Garcia, Batangas, 684 Phil. 283, 292 (2012):** Four requisites for a preliminary injunction.

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   The retroactive effect of the initial unenforceability of DBM CCC No. 10 and its subsequent republication are potential points of contention, although the court ruled that the base legal authority of RA 6758 still stands on its own authority.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COA's disallowance. The Court affirmed that LLDA's corporate charter was effectively repealed by R.A. No. 6758, meaning the agency became subject to standardized salary regulations. The Court emphasized the self-executing nature of some provisions within R.A. No. 6758, independent of the implementing rules. The ruling highlights the strict application of compensation laws and the limited exceptions.
