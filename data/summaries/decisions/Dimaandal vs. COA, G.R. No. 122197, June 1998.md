## Legal Document Summary: Dimaandal v. COA (G.R. No. 122197)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging a Commission on Audit (COA) decision disallowing salary and RATA differentials claimed by petitioner Zosimo M. Dimaandal.

**Key Issue:** Whether an employee designated in an acting capacity is entitled to the difference in salary and allowances between their regular position and the higher position to which they were designated.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, affirming the COA decision.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Disallowance:** COA disallowed and ordered the refund of P61,308.00, representing salary and RATA differential received by Dimaandal in 1993.
*   **Designation vs. Appointment:** The Court emphasized the distinction between a *designation* (mere imposition of additional duties) and an *appointment* (selection by proper authority to exercise the powers of a given office). Dimaandal only received a *designation.*
*   **Appointing Authority:** The power to appoint or temporarily designate an Assistant Provincial Treasurer resides with the Secretary of Finance, not the Governor.
*   **Refund Obligation:** Dimaandal is obligated to refund the disallowed amount.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Financial Liability:** Dimaandal is liable for the P61,308.00 refund.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Refund:** COA will likely pursue enforcement of the refund through salary deductions or other collection methods.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code), Sec. 471(a):** Vests the power to appoint an assistant treasurer with the Secretary of Finance.
*   **Revised Administrative Code, Sec. 2077:** Authorizes the President or officer with appointment power to order compensation to an employee temporarily filling a vacant position, but does not authorize the Provincial Governor to designate one temporarily in cases of temporary absence or disability or a vacancy in a provincial office
*   **Santiago vs. COA, 199 SCRA 125:** Case cited by the COA to differentiate between appointment and designation.
*   **Animos vs. Philippine Veterans Affairs Office, 174 SCRA 214, 218:** The construction given by the agency charged with enforcing a statute should be given great weight and respect.
*   **Cui, et. al. vs. Ortiz, et. al., G.R. No. L-13753:** Inapplicable to this case.
*   **Menzon vs. Petilla, 197 SCRA 253:** Inapplicable to this case.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **De Facto Officer Argument:** Dimaandal argued he was a de facto officer entitled to salary for services rendered. The Court rejected this, finding that the Governor lacked even colorable authority to designate him.
*   **Constitutional Arguments:** Dimaandal argued non-payment violated due process and impaired contractual obligations. The Court rejected these, finding no established right to the salary and RATA.

**Analysis:**

The Court strictly construed the statutory requirements for appointment and designation. The key point is the Governor lacked the legal authority to designate Dimaandal to the higher position, rendering the designation invalid. As such, Dimaandal has no legal basis to claim the benefits attached to the higher position. The Court held that Dimaandal was not a *de facto* officer as his appointment was void ab initio, not merely irregular.
