**Legal Document Summary: *Guerzon, Jr. v. Pasig Industries, Inc.*, G.R. No. 170266 (2008)**

**Nature:** Supreme Court Resolution addressing a petition for review on certiorari concerning illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Petitioners (Guerzon, Cruz, Bauyon) were employees of Respondent Pasig Industries, Inc. (PII). PII closed its Makati office, offering petitioners a Special Separation Package (SSP) equivalent to one month's basic salary per year of service.
*   **Negotiation & Acceptance:** Petitioners successfully negotiated for a recomputation of SSP based on monthly *gross* pay (basic pay plus allowances). They received payment and resigned.
*   **Subsequent Complaint:** Two days after termination/resignation, Petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.
*   **Procedural History:**
    *   **Labor Arbiter:** Ruled in favor of Petitioners, finding illegal dismissal.
    *   **NLRC:** Reversed the Labor Arbiter, finding voluntary resignation based on SSP acceptance and negotiation.
    *   **Court of Appeals:** Affirmed the NLRC.
    *   **Supreme Court:** Denied the petition.

**Holding & Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, finding no illegal dismissal. The Court emphasized that Petitioners, as employees in responsible positions, knowingly and voluntarily accepted the SSP, even negotiating better terms.
*   The Court cited *Globe Telecom v. Crisologo, G.R. No. 174644, 10 August 2007, 529 SCRA 811, 818*.
*   The Court cited *Samaniego v. NLRC, G.R. No. 93095, 3 June 1991, 198 SCRA 111, 118-119*.
*   Because of their voluntary resignation, the Court deemed the legitimacy of the companyâ€™s reorganization (potential authorized cause under the Labor Code) immaterial.

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Voluntariness of Resignation:** The crucial issue is whether the resignation was truly voluntary or coerced. While the Court highlights negotiation, a potential argument remains that the employees were effectively forced to resign due to the office closure.
*   **Constructive Dismissal Argument:** Although seemingly waived by acceptance of the SSP, there is an underlying argument that the office closure and SSP offer constituted constructive dismissal.
*   **Compliance with Art. 283 of the Labor Code (Prior to 2017 Amendments):** Footnote 2 makes reference to Article 283, regarding the employers serving a written notice on workers and the Secretary of Labor at least one month before the effective date of termination.
*   **Separation Pay Calculation (Labor Code Compliance):** While PII offered terms "better" than the law required (one month's pay or at least one-half month's pay for every year of service as required under Art. 283, depending on the cause of closure), a detailed analysis of the computation is required.
*   **Possible Coercion/Undue Influence:** Assess the circumstances surrounding the offer and acceptance of the SSP.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The term "streamlining of PII's operations" is vague.
*   The nature of the "allowances" included in the gross pay calculation is undefined.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 283 (Prior to 2017 Amendments):** Closure of Establishment and Reduction of Personnel.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Globe Telecom v. Crisologo, G.R. No. 174644, 10 August 2007, 529 SCRA 811, 818* (on voluntary relinquishment of rights).
*   *Samaniego v. NLRC, G.R. No. 93095, 3 June 1991, 198 SCRA 111, 118-119* (on voluntary resignation after improved terms).
