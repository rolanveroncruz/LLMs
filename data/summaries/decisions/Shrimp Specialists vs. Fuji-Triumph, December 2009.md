## Legal Document Summary: Shrimp Specialists, Inc. vs. Fuji-Triumph Agri-Industrial Corporation

**Case:** *Shrimp Specialists, Inc. vs. Fuji-Triumph Agri-Industrial Corporation* (G.R. No. 168756 & G.R. No. 171476)

**Nature:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari regarding a distributorship agreement dispute for prawn feeds.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Distributorship Agreement:** Fuji agreed to supply prawn feeds to Shrimp Specialists on credit.
*   **Payment:** Shrimp Specialists issued postdated checks for deliveries.
*   **Warranty (Disputed):** Shrimp Specialists alleges feeds were contaminated with aflatoxin, leading to stop-payment orders. Fuji denies contamination.
*   **Replacement Agreement:** A written agreement (CK # 158002-006) stated that Fuji would replace defective feeds, and Shrimp Specialist would inform Fuji in advance if checks could not be deposited.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Shrimp Specialists:** Held liable for P767,427.00 (principal for delivered feeds) plus interest (6% from extrajudicial demand, 12% from finality of judgment) and attorney's fees (P30,000.00).
*   **Eugene Lim (President of Shrimp Specialists):** Initially held solidarily liable by the trial court, but the CA absolved him. Supreme Court affirmed CA decision to free him from liability.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Clause:** The phrase "to inform in advance in case the same checks cannot be deposited for failure to replace the defective feeds" is a contentious point. Shrimp Specialists argues it's an admission of defective feeds by Fuji. Fuji contends it's too ambiguous.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** Shrimp Specialists failed to provide sufficient evidence of feed contamination, including a formal complaint, third-party representation during inspection, and conclusive laboratory testing.
*   **Solidary Liability:** The CA's dismissal of claims against Eugene Lim highlights the importance of demonstrating specific actions (e.g., bad faith, conflict of interest, unlawful acts) to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability on corporate officers.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1249 of the Civil Code:** Addressed the validity of payment by checks; the obligation subsists if the checks are not cashed due to the debtor's fault (stop-payment order).
*   **CMS Logging, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 41420):** Addressed requirements for a statement to qualify as an admission (definite, certain, unequivocal language).
*   **Uy v. Villanueva (G.R. No. 157851):** Outlined the exceptional circumstances under which corporate officers can be held solidarily liable with the corporation.

**Analysis & Recommendations:**

The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, focusing on the factual determination that Shrimp Specialists failed to provide sufficient evidence of defective feed. The ambiguous clause was deemed not to constitute a clear admission of liability by Fuji. Further, imposition of solidary liability on corporate officers requires demonstrating specific unlawful acts, bad faith, or other exceptional circumstances per *Uy v. Villanueva*. Going forward, parties should ensure agreements contain precise language, conduct thorough due diligence, preserve all necessary evidentiary documentation (e.g. lab test result, written complaints), and clearly document any defects or issues.
