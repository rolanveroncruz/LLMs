## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-24-064

**Case:** *Honorable Leo L. Intia vs. Honorable Erwin Virgilio P. Ferrer*

**Nature:** Administrative complaint filed by Judge Intia against retired Executive Judge Ferrer alleging: (1) Instigating a lawyer against Judge Intia, (2) Maintaining an insurance business, and (3) Violating Supreme Court circulars regarding Persons Deprived of Liberty (PDLs).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge 1 (Instigating a Lawyer):** Dismissed for lack of substantial evidence. Atty. Botor denied Ferrer instigated him. The Court found the likely cause of Intia's animosity was Ferrer filing corruption cases against Intia.
*   **Charge 2 (Insurance Business):** Ferrer admitted to owning an insurance business inherited from his father, registered in his name and declared in his SALN, but claimed he didn't manage it and was being managed by Aguilar.
    *   **Finding:** Ferrer is liable for violating Administrative Circular No. 5 (1988), which prohibits judiciary employees from engaging in the insurance business, even if managed by someone else. This constitutes a less serious offense under Section 15, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court. The Court found no intent to circumvent the law.
*   **Charge 3 (Violation of SC Circulars re: PDLs):** Dismissed for lack of merit. The Court noted that the cases were being reported, resettings were made at the instance of parties. The OCA Audit didn't reveal the delays.
*   **Charges 4 and 5 (Unbecoming conduct against Valencia, PO1 Jacob and Brgy. Captain Rodriguez):** Dismissed for lack of merit, case re: Valencia was dismissed in OCA IPI No. 21-5116-RTJ. Charges re: PO1 Jacob and Barangay Captain Rodriguez was mere hearsay and not substantiated by the parties.

**Liabilities:**

*   Executive Judge Ferrer (ret.) is found liable for violating Administrative Circular No. 5 for owning an insurance business while serving as a judge.

**Penalties:**

*   Executive Judge Ferrer (ret.) is directed to pay a fine of PHP 35,000.00, to be deducted from his retirement benefits if unpaid within 3 months.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Enforcement of Fine:** Deduction from retirement benefits may face legal challenge depending on the nature of those benefits and any applicable regulations regarding their garnishment.
*   **Reliance on Aguilar's Management:** While not explicitly stated, the reliance on the fact that Aguilar managed the business does not absolve Ferrer from the full liability, as ownership alone violates the circular.
*   **Subjectivity in Penalty Determination:** While the Court considered mitigating factors, the determination of the penalty amount involves some degree of subjectivity. This could be grounds for appeal, though unlikely to succeed given the relatively minor nature of the penalty and previous precedent.
