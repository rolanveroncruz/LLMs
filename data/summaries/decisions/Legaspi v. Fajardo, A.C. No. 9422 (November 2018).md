**Legal Document Summary: *Atty. Florante S. Legaspi v. Atty. El Cid C. Fajardo*, A.C. No. 9422**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against Atty. Fajardo for conflict of interest.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   Atty. Legaspi, representing Cristina Gabriel (Gabriel), filed Civil Case No. CV-08-5950.
*   Atty. Fajardo entered appearance as collaborating counsel for defendant Jannet Malino (Malino) *before* the RTC decision based on a compromise agreement.
*   Atty. Fajardo *then* filed an entry of appearance as attorney-in-fact for *plaintiff* Gabriel in the *same* case, and filed motions to dismiss and terminate Atty. Legaspi's services.
*   The RTC denied Fajardo's motions, deeming them moot.
*   Atty. Fajardo admitted accepting Gabriel's appointment was advantageous to Malino.

**Violations:**

*   Violation of Canon 15, Rules 15.01 and 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).
    *   Rule 15.01: Ascertaining conflict of interest with another client, if so, inform the prospective client.
    *   Rule 15.03: Representing conflicting interests except by written consent of all concerned given after full disclosure of the facts.

**Obligations Violated:**

*   Duty of undivided allegiance to a client.
*   Prohibition against representing conflicting interests, stemming from fiduciary duty and public policy.
*   Maintaining client confidentiality and avoiding even the *appearance* of impropriety.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative sanction for professional misconduct.
*   Suspension from the practice of law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflict of Interest:** *Hornilla v. Salunat* provides the test: lawyer's duty to fight for an issue for one client versus opposing it for another; use of confidential information acquired from a former client. Here, Fajardo acted as counsel against his former client, Legaspi.
*   **Breach of Confidentiality:** While not explicitly stated, the potential for using information gained as Malino's counsel to Gabriel's detriment exists, raising concerns.
*   **Undermining Trust in Legal Profession:** Actions erode public trust in lawyers, particularly given the importance of candid client communication.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canon 15, Rules 15.01 & 15.03:** The primary basis for the administrative sanction.
*   ***Hornilla v. Salunat, 453 Phil. 108 (2003):*** Outlines the parameters for determining the presence of conflict of interest, specifically addressing the duty to fight for or against an issue of a client.
*   ***Ani√±on v. Sabitsana, Jr., 685 Phil. 322 (2012) & Santos Ventura Horcoma Foundation, Inc. v. Funk, 692 Phil. 502 (2012):*** Cited as precedent for imposing a one-year suspension for representing conflicting interests.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Atty. Fajardo's defense claiming his actions were "merely clerical" is not supported and was rejected. His own admission that acting as Gabriel's attorney-in-fact was advantageous to Malino is problematic.

**IBP Recommendation & Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   The IBP recommended a one-year suspension, which the Supreme Court adopted, finding Atty. Fajardo guilty of violating Rules 15.01 and 15.03 of the CPR. He was suspended from practice for one year and sternly warned.

**Conclusion:**

Atty. Fajardo's actions constituted a clear conflict of interest, violating established principles of professional ethics and warranting administrative sanction. The Supreme Court's ruling emphasizes the importance of undivided loyalty to clients and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.
