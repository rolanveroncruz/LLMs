## Summary of *Guillen v. Nicolas*, A.M. No. MTJ-98-1166

**Overview:** This is an administrative matter against Judge Aproniano B. Nicolas for gross ignorance of the law, gross incompetence, and evident partiality in handling five criminal cases (Slander by Deed, Malicious Mischief, and Direct Assault) where the complainants were the offended parties.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Irregular Procedure:** Judge Nicolas arraigned the accused without a warrant of arrest, which complainants argued was required.
*   **Incorrect Application of Summary Procedure:** The Judge applied the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure to cases where ordinary procedure should have been applied (Specifically regarding the direct assault case involving a person in authority) rendering Section 16 on arrests inapplicable. This, coupled with the related nature of the offenses, invalidated the use of the Revised Rule of Summary Procedure.
*   **Failure to Follow Rule 112 Procedure:** Failed to follow the proper procedure as outlined in Rule 112, Section 9(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure. Specifically he failed to examine the complainants and witnesses.
*   **Motion for Issuance of Warrant of Arrest:** The Judge denied the motion for issuance of warrant of arrest and subsequently required the accused to post bail, which is inconsistent since bail is for those in custody.
*   **Reduction of Bail:** Judge reduced bail amount, although this was ultimately not a significant factor due to a lack of showing that it was inadequate.
*   **Evident Partiality:** Complainants alleged the Judge was biased due to his close relationship and potential business ties with the accused Isidro Jacinto.
*   **Notarization Impropriety:** The Judge notarized promissory notes for Jacinto's business without remitting fees to the treasurer or certifying the absence of other notary publics, violating Circular No. 1-90.
*   **The ruling in *Caamic vs. Galapon***, which stated that judges are held to a high standard of conduct to avoid impropriety.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judges must adhere to proper criminal procedure:** The respondent failed to adhere to the proper criminal procedure for the crimes alleged
*   **Judge held to a high standard of conduct:** Judges must avoid impropriety and appearances of impropriety and must adhere to the standards of Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   **Judge is responsible for remitting notarization fees to the government:** Judges must adhere to Circular 1-90 with regards to notarization fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The main risk for Judge Nicolas is disciplinary action due to proven misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, and evident partiality.
*   Undermining public confidence in the judiciary due to perceived bias and improper conduct.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Rule on Summary Procedure:** Cited for its inapplicability due to the nature of the offenses and the related cases.
*   **Rule 112, Section 9(b) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure:** Relevant to the proper procedure for cases falling within the jurisdiction of inferior courts but not the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure.
*   **B.P. Bldg. 129, Section 32 (2), as ammended by Republic Act No. 7691:** Relevant to the jurisdiction of Municipal Circuit Trial Courts vs. Regional Trial Courts.
*   **Circular No. 1-90:** Violation for improper notarization practices.
*   **Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Violated by the judge's actions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **The reduction of bail:** While raised, the complainants failed to show that the reduced bail of 500 was grossly inadequate.
*   The Judge denied the motion for issuance of warrant of arrest but required the accused to post bail.

**Outcome:** Judge Nicolas was found guilty of gross ignorance of the law; evident partiality amounting to grave abuse of authority and conduct prejudicial to best interest of the service; and violation of Circular 1-90 and Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. He was suspended for six months without pay and fined P10,000.
