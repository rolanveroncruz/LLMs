**Legal Document Summary: *Cariño v. Espinoza, G.R. No. 166036, June 19, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing Court of Appeals' dismissal of an appeal in a case for Legal Redemption and Damages with Writ of Preliminary Injunction.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Action:** Respondent (Espinoza) sued Petitioner (Cariño) and Penullar for legal redemption after Penullar sold his 1/4 share of a parcel of land (co-owned with Espinoza) to Cariño. Espinoza claimed lack of proper notice of the sale, invoking the right of legal redemption.
*   **Trial Court Ruling:** RTC ruled in favor of Espinoza, ordering Cariño and Penullar to allow redemption, execute a deed of redemption, and pay attorney's fees and costs.
*   **Appeal & Dismissal:** Cariño appealed to the CA. CA dismissed the appeal for failure to timely file the appellant's brief, citing Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Cariño argued that the failure to file the brief was due to her counsel's illness and that submission prior to the resolution constituted substantial compliance.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissal.  The Court held that the general rule is that a client is bound by the acts, even mistakes, of counsel, with limited exceptions such as gross negligence depriving the client of due process.  Counsel's illness (hypertension attack) was deemed insufficient justification, given the extensive delay of seven months after the granted extension and the timing of the medical certificate. The court held the right to appeal is a statutory privilege and the delay was inexcusable.

**Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner (Cariño):** To allow Espinoza to redeem Penullar's 1/4 share of the land. Execute a deed of redemption. Pay attorney's fees and costs to Espinoza jointly and severally with Penullar.
*   **Penullar:** Same obligations as Cariño regarding the redemption and payment of attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Cariño and Penullar:** Joint and several liability for attorney's fees and costs.  Specific performance for the redemption of property interest.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Trial Court Judgment:** Espinoza can enforce the trial court's judgment, compelling Cariño to allow the redemption and pay the monetary obligations.
*   **Future Litigation:** Possible disputes arising from the redemption process or the deed of redemption.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 1(e), Rule 50 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Grounds for dismissal of appeal, specifically, failure to file the appellant's brief.
*   **Estate of Macadangdang v. Gaviola, G.R. No. 156809, 4 March 2009:** Client bound by counsel's actions, with exceptions.
*   **Canton v. City of Cebu, G.R. No. 152898, 12 February 2007, 515 SCRA 441:** Rules of procedure should facilitate justice, but right to appeal is statutory.
*   **Relevant provisions on Legal Redemption under the Civil Code of the Philippines (Articles 1620-1625, or as applicable based on the nature of the co-ownership).**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original denial by Penullar and Cariño regarding the sale, which was disputed by Espinoza. This suggests a potential issue of bad faith.
*   The vague assertion of "substantial compliance" by Cariño regarding the appellant's brief filing.

**Advice Points**

*   The decision emphasizes the importance of adhering to procedural rules, particularly deadlines for filing documents in appeals.
*   Consider any potential actions for relief from judgment based on excusable negligence, but success is unlikely given the court's position.
*   Focus on strategies for complying with the trial court's judgment regarding redemption, deed execution, and payment of obligations.
