## Legal Document Summary: Espina-Dan v. Dan, G.R. No. 209031

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking to overturn the CA's decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of Petitioner's (Abigael An Espina-Dan) petition for declaration of nullity of marriage to Respondent (Marco Dan) based on Article 36 of the Family Code (psychological incapacity).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Defines psychological incapacity as a ground for nullity, requiring incapacity to comply with essential marital obligations at the time of marriage.
*   **Essential Marital Obligations (Article 68, Family Code):** Live together, observe mutual love, respect, and fidelity, and render help and support.

**Obligations:**

*   Both parties enter into the agreement with the expectation that each party will comply with the requirements outlined in Article 68 of the Family Code.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Petitioner:** Failed to prove Respondent's psychological incapacity at the time of marriage based on the Santos v. CA standards.
*   **Petitioner:** Risked dismissal due to insufficient and one-sided evidence and lack of personal examination of respondent.
*   **Petitioner:** Risked claims that this was an incompatibility and irreconcilable differences case.
*   **Marriage Continuance:** The State (Republic of the Philippines) has an interest in upholding the validity of the marriage.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 36, Family Code:** Basis of the nullity claim.
*   **Santos v. Court of Appeals (240 SCRA 20, 24):** Landmark case defining the requirements of psychological incapacity: gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability.
*   **Republic v. Court of Appeals and Molina:** Laid down definitive guidelines in the interpretation and application of Article 36.
*   **Toring v. Toring** The Supreme Court held that psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code must be characterized by (a) gravity, (b) juridical antecedence, and (c) incurability, to be sufficient basis to annul a marriage.
*   **Marcos v. Marcos (397 Phil. 840 (2000)), Antonio v. Reyes (519 Phil. 337 (2006)), Suazo v. Suazo (629 Phil. 157 (2010)), Ngo Te v. Gutierrez Yu-Te (598 Phil. 666 (2009)):** Cases cited regarding the necessity of personal examination of the allegedly incapacitated spouse, concluding it is not mandatory.
*   **Rumbaua v. Rumbaua (612 Phil, 1061 (2009)), Viñas v. Parel-Viñas (751 Phil. 762, 775-776 (2015)):** Cases cited regarding the proper evaluation of the psychologist's testimony and psychological report.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Insufficient Evidence of Incapacity:** The Court found that the traits, character, and attitude of the respondent did not meet the Article 36 standard, and that there was irreconcilable differences based on culture and upbringing.
*   **Psychological Evaluation:** The Court criticized the psychologist's report for relying solely on the petitioner's information without interviewing the respondent or having him undergo psychological tests. The Court found that the report was one-sided and cannot be credited as conclusive.
*   **Necessity of Personal Examination:** The petitioner tried to argue that the personal examination of the respondent was not necessary. However, the Court noted that there are instances where personal examination is required.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Petitioner's Case Weakness:** The case highlights the difficulty of proving psychological incapacity without corroborating evidence from impartial sources and without a direct evaluation of the respondent.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The petitioner consistently failed to discharge the burden of proof required to overcome the presumption of validity of marriage.

**Conclusion:** The Court denied the Petition and the marriage's validity. The judgment emphasizes the high bar for proving psychological incapacity under Article 36, Family Code, and the importance of unbiased, thorough psychological assessments.
