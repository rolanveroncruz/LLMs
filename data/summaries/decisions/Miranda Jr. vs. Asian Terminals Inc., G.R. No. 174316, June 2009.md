**Legal Document Summary: Miranda v. Asian Terminals, Inc. (ATI)**

**Citation:** G.R. No. 174316, June 23, 2009 (608 Phil. 392)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' amended decision finding the case moot and academic.

**Parties:**

*   Petitioner: Teodorico S. Miranda, Jr. (Former Checker I and Union Shop Steward)
*   Respondents: Asian Terminals, Inc. (ATI), Court of Appeals

**Background:**

Miranda was a Checker I at ATI and a Union Shop Steward.  He was recalled as Shop Steward due to alleged loss of trust and confidence.  Multiple legal actions were filed regarding his recall and subsequent assignments. The key issue revolved around his recall from Shop Steward (a union position under the payroll of the company), his subsequent assignment to lower-ranking positions within ATI, and the question of whether his recall was valid and compliant with due process. A retrenchment occurred after the labor arbiter made a decision.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

1.  **Nature of Shop Steward Position:** The Supreme Court (SC) clarified that a Shop Steward is a *union* position, not a company position, despite being on the company payroll. *Santa Rosa Coca-Cola Plant Employees Union v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 164302-03, January 24, 2007) was cited to confirm that the Shop Steward occupies a position of trust within the union. This characterization significantly impacts the jurisdiction and remedies available.

2.  **Intra-Union Dispute:** The SC held that the controversy surrounding Miranda's recall is an *intra-union dispute*, falling under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) pursuant to Article 226 of the Labor Code. This means that the labor arbiter lacked jurisdiction over the matter.

3.  **Med-Arbiter Ruling:** The Secretary of Labor affirmed the Med-Arbiter's finding that Miranda's recall was invalid due to lack of cause and due process violations regarding a violation of the APCWU Constitution and By-Laws which requires that the recall must be approved by the union Board of Directors. The facts and findings of the Med-Arbiter and the Secretary of Labor are generally conclusive on appeal

4.  **Labor Arbiter's Lack of Jurisdiction:** The labor arbiter lacked jurisdiction, and the decisions void for want of jurisdiction.

5.  **Mootness Due to Retrenchment:** The most crucial aspect is that Miranda was *retrenched* by ATI and executed a *Quit Claim and Release* (QCR) for P367,500.00 (including attorneyâ€™s fees) concerning his retrenchment, which was duly executed before the Second Division of the NLRC in NLRC CA No. 032809-02. While the present case was explicitly excluded from the scope of the QCR, the SC held that reinstatement to *either* Shop Steward or Checker I is no longer feasible due to his separation from ATI, rendering the case moot. *Honesto B. Villarosa v. Hon. Cresenciano B. Trajano* (G.R. No. 73679, July 23, 1992) was cited regarding an elections term expiring.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **ATI:** Although ATI may have initially been liable for acting on an invalid union decision, the subsequent retrenchment and QCR absolved them of any current obligation to reinstate Miranda or pay further backwages related to his employment *with the company*. The QCR is upheld, preventing further financial liability to ATI.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Contradictory Rulings:** The legal process was prolonged due to the initial confusion regarding jurisdiction and the nature of the Shop Steward position.
*   **Impact of QCR:** The QCR's specific exclusion of this case created a potential legal ambiguity which ultimately did not change the court's decision.
*   **Mootness Argument:** The changing factual circumstances (retrenchment, QCR) substantially altered the legal landscape and ultimately determined the outcome.

**Case Law:**

*   *Santa Rosa Coca-Cola Plant Employees Union v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc.* (G.R. Nos. 164302-03, January 24, 2007) - Defines the position of union shop steward.
*   *Honesto B. Villarosa v. Hon. Cresenciano B. Trajano* (G.R. No. 73679, July 23, 1992) - Relates to mootness due to expiration of a term.
*   *Wenphil Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 80587, February 8, 1989) - Relates to indemnity for failure to observe due process (applied by Labor Arbiter).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The exclusion of the current case from the QCR, while initially seemingly beneficial to Miranda, was ultimately irrelevant as the impossibility of reinstatement rendered the case moot.
*   The confusing wording of the Labor Arbiter's decision, especially the contradictory pronouncements regarding constructive dismissal.

**Conclusion:**

The SC dismissed the petition as moot and academic. While the initial recall of Miranda may have been invalid, the QCR executed following his retrenchment made reinstatement impossible, absolving ATI of further liability under the existing circumstances. This case highlights the importance of correctly identifying the nature of the legal dispute (intra-union vs. employer-employee) and the significant impact of subsequent factual developments (retrenchment, QCR) on the ultimate outcome of labor disputes.
