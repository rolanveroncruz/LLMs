## Legal Document Summary: *Republic v. Sereno* (G.R. No. 237428, May 11, 2018)

**Nature of Document:**  Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines on a *quo warranto* petition.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Republic of the Philippines (represented by the Solicitor General)
*   **Respondent:** Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno (incumbent Chief Justice of the Supreme Court)

**Core Issue:** Whether *quo warranto* is a proper remedy to challenge the validity of Sereno's appointment as Chief Justice, given that she is an impeachable officer, and whether she met the "proven integrity" qualification for the position due to alleged SALN filing deficiencies.

**Summary of Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Republic's Argument:** Sereno was ineligible for the position due to a lack of "proven integrity" stemming from her alleged failure to regularly file SALNs during her tenure at the University of the Philippines College of Law and as legal counsel for the Republic.  This failure violates the Constitution (Art. XI, Sec. 17; Art. VIII, Sec. 7(3)), the Anti-Graft Law (R.A. 3019), and the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (R.A. 6713).  The JBC's nomination did not cure this deficiency. *Quo warranto* is a proper remedy even against impeachable officers, permissible because it questions the validity of the appointment, not her conduct in office. The prescriptive period of one year does not apply to the State or should be reckoned from the discovery of the deficiencies during impeachment proceedings.
*   **Sereno's Argument:** As an impeachable officer, she can only be removed through impeachment (Art. XI, Sec. 2). *Quo warranto* is inappropriate and encroaches on Congress' impeachment power. This Court lacks disciplinary authority over its sitting members. The petition is time-barred, exceeding the one-year limit from the alleged "cause of ouster" (the alleged SALN failures). The state cannot overturn the presumption that her appointment to office was regular. Finally, any issue as to whether she possessed “proven integrity” is a political question constitutionally committed to the JBC.
*   **Court's Holding:** *Quo warranto* is a proper remedy. The Court has jurisdiction. The petition is not time-barred because prescription does not run against the State, or the discovery of the defect in her appointment. Sereno was ineligible as Chief Justice due to a lack of "proven integrity" stemming from SALN non-compliance and misrepresentation to the JBC. Her inclusion in the JBC shortlist and subsequent appointment did not cure this ineligibility.

**Key Provisions Highlighted by the Court:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 5(1):**  Grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over *quo warranto* petitions.
*   **Article XI, Section 2:** Defines impeachable officers and the grounds for impeachment. The Court interprets "may" in this section as permissive, allowing for other removal methods.
*   **Article VIII, Section 7(3):**  States that members of the Judiciary must be persons of "proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence." The Court found that the integrity requirement was not met, so that respondent's appointment was invalid.
*   **Rule 66 of the Rules of Court:** Governs *quo warranto* proceedings.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *Estrada v. Desierto*:  Cited for the proposition that the Supreme Court can take cognizance of a quo warranto action to oust an impeachable official.
    *   *Funa v. Villar* and *Nacionalista Party v. De Vera*: Arguing that quo warranto may be resorted to against even impeachable officers.
    *   *Concerned Taxpayer v. Doblada, Jr.*: Distinguishes facts.
    *   *Lecaroz v. Sandiganbayan*: Demonstrates that impeachment proceedings and a *quo warranto* action are distinct.
    *   *Agcaoili v. Suguitan*:  Explains the non-absolute character of the one-year prescriptive period.
    *  *Jardeleza v. Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes P. A. Sereno, et al.*: Explains power of the Court vis-a-vis power of JBC
*   **Statutes:**
    *   R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act): Sets standards of conduct for public officials and penalizes violations.
    *   R.A. 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees):  Requires the filing of SALNs and imposes penalties for non-compliance.
    *   The Civil Code of the Philippines

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Public Officers:**  Obligated to file truthful and accurate SALNs (R.A. 6713, Sec. 8; R.A. 3019). Failure to do so can lead to administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, and disqualification from public office.
*   **JBC:** Obligated to thoroughly vet judicial candidates for "proven competence, integrity, probity, and independence" (Art. VIII, Sec. 7(3)).
*   **Chief Justice Sereno:**  The respondent was obligated to demonstrate her eligibility, which she failed to do.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Setting Precedent:**  The decision sets a precedent for challenging the qualifications of impeachable officers via *quo warranto*, potentially weakening the intended insulation and security of tenure for certain high-ranking officials.
*   **Erosion of Judicial Independence:**  The SolGen's power to initiate *quo warranto* proceedings could be seen as a tool for the Executive to exert influence over the Judiciary (and other independent constitutional bodies), undermining its independence.
*   **"Proven Integrity" Definition:**  The Court provides clarity regarding the constitutional requirement of integrity.
