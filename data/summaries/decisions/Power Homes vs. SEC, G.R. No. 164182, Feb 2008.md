**Legal Document Summary: *Power Homes Unlimited Corporation vs. Securities and Exchange Commission and Noel Manero*, G.R. No. 164182**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals decision that affirmed a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **CDO:** SEC ordered Power Homes to cease and desist from selling, offering for sale, or distributing securities due to non-registration in violation of Section 8.1 of the Securities Regulation Code (RA 8799).
*   **Definition of Securities:**  The SEC argues Power Homes' business constitutes the sale of investment contracts, which are defined as securities under Sec. 3.1(b) of RA 8799.
*   **Investment Contract Definition:** The court relies on the *Howey Test* (SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293) and its subsequent interpretation by *SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc. et al.*, emphasizing a flexible interpretation where profits derive *primarily*, not solely, from the efforts of others. The Court finds that the business scheme of Power Homes meets this requirement.
*   **Due Process:** Court finds SEC followed due process. Cites Sec. 64 of R.A. No. 8799 regarding Cease and Desist order and that a formal hearing is not necessary

**Obligations:**

*   **Power Homes:** Obligation to register its investment contracts with the SEC before offering them for sale or distribution to the public, per Section 8.1 of RA 8799.
*   **SEC:** Obligation to protect the investing public from unregistered and potentially fraudulent securities.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Power Homes:** Subject to penalties and sanctions for violating the Securities Regulation Code, including the CDO.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Regulatory Enforcement:** Continued enforcement actions by the SEC, including potential fines and further restrictions on business operations.
*   **Civil Litigation:** Potential lawsuits from investors who claim to have suffered losses due to Power Homes' unregistered securities offerings.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8799 (Securities Regulation Code):** Section 3.1(b) (definition of securities, investment contracts); Section 8.1 (registration requirement); Section 64 (Cease and Desist Orders).
*   **SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946):** Established the *Howey Test* for determining investment contracts.
*   **SEC v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc. et al., 474 F.2d 476:** Clarified the "solely" requirement in the *Howey Test* regarding profits derived from others' efforts, interpreting it flexibly as "primarily".

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around whether Power Homes' business model constitutes an investment contract requiring SEC registration. Power Homes likely argues that its business does not primarily rely on the efforts of others.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the CA decision affirming the SEC's CDO against Power Homes. The Court determined that Power Homes' scheme constitutes an unregistered investment contract in violation of the Securities Regulation Code, emphasizing the need for SEC oversight to protect investors.
