**Legal Document Summary: Letran Calamba Faculty and Employees Association v. National Labor Relations Commission and Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba, Inc. (G.R. No. 156225)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's dismissal of a certiorari petition regarding an NLRC decision. The core issue is the inclusion of faculty overload pay in the computation of the 13th-month pay.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Wage Order No. 5 Compliance:** Petitioner alleged non-compliance, but LA and NLRC found the school settled obligations after a one-year exemption, based on a settlement agreement.
*   **Compensation for Excess Load:** Petitioner claimed improper computation of compensation per unit of excess load. LA and NLRC dismissed the claim because there were no classes for certain periods.
*   **Job Grading:** Petitioner alleged unpaid salary increases due to job grading for non-academic personnel. LA and NLRC denied the claim because "job grading" was inconsistent.
*   **Tuition Fee Increase Share:** Petitioner claimed unpaid balances from tuition fee increases. LA and NLRC found that the school incurred a deficit or paid a significant portion of the increments.
*   **Holiday Pay:** Petitioner claimed non-payment of holiday pay. LA and NLRC found that employees were paid for all days worked, indicating that holiday pay was included in their monthly salary.
*   **13th-Month Pay Calculation (Central Issue):** Petitioner argues that compensation for teaching overloads should be included in the 13th-month pay calculation, citing DOLE opinions. Respondent argues that overloads are not part of the basic salary and relies on DOLE Order No. 02, Series of 1996, which excludes overload pay.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Union):** To prove its members are entitled to the monetary claims, particularly 13th-month pay inclusion of overload pay.
*   **Respondent (Colegio de San Juan de Letran):** To properly compute and pay the 13th-month pay based on the correct interpretation of applicable laws and regulations.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Conflicting Interpretations:** DOLE opinions and orders offer conflicting guidance on the inclusion of overload pay in 13th-month pay calculations.
*   **Retroactive Application:** Application of DOLE Order No. 02 (1996) to claims originating before its issuance.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Challenges to the LA/NLRC findings concerning compliance with Wage Order No. 5, tuition fee increase sharing, and holiday pay.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 851:** 13th Month Pay Law.
*   **Labor Code (Art. 83, 87, 93, 94, 100):** Normal working hours, overtime, holiday pay, prohibition against elimination or diminution of benefits.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) 6727:** Wage Rationalization Act
*   **San Miguel Corporation v. Inciong (G.R. No. L-49774, February 24, 1981):** Defines "basic salary" for 13th-month pay purposes.
*   **Agustilo v. Court of Appeals (417 Phil. 218 (2001)):** Regarding the scope of review in certiorari proceedings.
*   **Odango v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No.147420, June 10, 2004):** Scope of certiorari jurisdiction in labor cases.
* **Wage Order No. 5:** Regional wage order whose compliance is contested by the union.
* **DECS Memorandum Circular No. 2 dated March 10, 1989:** Formula for compensation per unit of excess load.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Basic Salary":** Whether the pay for teaching overloads falls within the definition of basic salary for 13th-month pay purposes. The Supreme Court held that overload pay is not part of the basic salary.
*   **Effect of DOLE Order No. 02 (1996):** Applicability to pending claims and its status as an interpretive rule.
* **Integration of Overload Pay to Monthly Salary:** The Supreme Court said that it is not illegally feasible to consider payment for such overload as part of a teacher's regular or basic salary.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that overload pay should not be included in the computation of 13th-month pay because it's additional compensation for extra work, not part of the regular basic salary. The Court deferred to the factual findings of the LA, NLRC, and CA, as they were supported by substantial evidence. The decision clarifies the interpretation of "basic salary" and limits the retroactive application of administrative orders that could negatively impact employee benefits.
