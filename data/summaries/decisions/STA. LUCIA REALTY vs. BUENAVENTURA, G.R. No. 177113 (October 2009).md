## Legal Document Summary - *Sta. Lucia Realty & Development, Inc. vs. Spouses Francisco & Emilia Buenaventura* (G.R. No. 177113)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the OP's decision holding Sta. Lucia Realty liable for damages and reimbursement related to a lot mix-up in a subdivision project.

**Key Facts:**

*   Spouses Buenaventura (Respondents) purchased Lot 3, Block 4, Phase II of Greenwood Executive Village from Alfonso, who originally purchased it from Sta. Lucia Realty (Petitioner).
*   Respondents discovered after buying the lot that it was occupied by others (Panlaque and Banez) who were issued a construction permit by Petitioner.
*   RCD Realty Corporation, due to an error facilitated by the Petitioner’s issuance of a construction permit, built on the wrong lot (Lot 3, Block 4, Phase II).
*   Respondents filed a complaint for specific performance, damages, and attorney's fees before the HLURB.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** As the subdivision developer, Sta. Lucia Realty had a duty to properly manage lot allocation and enforce restrictions annotated on the titles.
*   **Successor-in-Interest:** The Court affirmed that Respondents, as assignees of Alfonso, step into her shoes and acquire all rights and obligations from original contract. (Article 1311 of the New Civil Code).
*   **Rescission (Art. 1191, Civil Code):** HLURB Arbiter ordered Sta. Lucia Realty to reimburse the current market value of the lot as an alternative to Specific Performance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Sta. Lucia Realty's Liability:** Held liable for negligence for issuing a construction permit to RCD Realty Corporation for the wrong lot, causing damages to the respondents.
*   **Damages Awarded:** Moral damages (₱100,000), exemplary damages (₱50,000), and attorney's fees (₱50,000) were awarded to Respondents.
*   **Reimbursement:** Sta. Lucia Realty must reimburse the respondents the market value of the lot (₱3,200.00 per square meter).
*   **Interest:** Applicable interest rate for the amount to be reimbursed to respondents is 6% per annum from the time of filing of the complaint, and 12% per annum from the finality of the judgment until the amount awarded is fully paid. *(See Eastern Shipping Lines Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78.)*

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Indispensable Parties:** While Alfonso was originally not included, court determined she was no longer indispensable because all rights and obligations over Lot 3, Block 4 were already transferred to respondents.
*   **Occupants:** Although respondents were not able to implead the actual occupants of Lot 3, Block 4, Phase II, thus making specific performance impossible, Court said present ruling will not affect any action filed against respondents by owner of Lot 4, Block 4, Phase II.
*   **Respondents' Construction on Lot 4:** Sta. Lucia Realty alleged that Respondents erroneously built on Lot 4 (belonging to another owner), but court did not make a judgment on the matter.
*   **Joint Venture:** Although ACL and RCD were impleaded in a third-party complaint, the HLURB found only Sta. Lucia Realty liable.
*   **Negligence:** Case hinges on the negligence of Sta. Lucia Realty in its oversight of the subdivision project, and the subsequent reliance of RCD Realty Corporation on the faulty permits.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Article 1311 of the New Civil Code:** Regarding the transmissible nature of contractual rights and obligations to assigns and successors-in-interest.
*   **Moldes v. Villanueva, G.R. No. 161955:** Regarding indispensable parties in a court case.
*   **Article 1191 of the New Civil Code:** Power to rescind obligations.
*   **Eastern Shipping Lines Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78:** Regarding applicable legal interest rates.
