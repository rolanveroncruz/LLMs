**Legal Document Summary: People v. Sood, G.R. No. 227394**

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of shabu.  Accused-appellant was found guilty by the RTC, and the conviction was affirmed by the CA. The Supreme Court acquitted.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Prohibits the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, giving away to another, distribution, dispatch in transit or transport, or acting as a broker in the said transaction of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (original version):** Prescribes the mandatory procedure for the custody and disposition of confiscated, seized, and/or surrendered dangerous drugs. Key aspects include:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography of seized drugs *immediately* after seizure.
    *   Presence of the accused, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and any elected public official.
    *   Signatures of these witnesses on the inventory.
    *   Documentation of the chain of custody.
*   **Section 21(a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (IRR):** requires justifiable grounds for non-compliance with the procedure for inventory and photographing, and the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items should be properly preserved.

**Liabilities:**

*   Under RA 9165, conviction for selling 5.85 grams of shabu carries a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000.00.
*   Section 29 of RA 9165, imposes the penalty of death to any person who is found guilty of "planting" any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical, regardless of quantity and purity.
*   Section 32 of RA 9165, The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person found violating any regulation duly issued by the Board pursuant to this Act, in addition to the administrative sanctions imposed by the Board.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165:** The prosecution failed to demonstrate strict compliance with the mandatory procedure, which is grounds for acquittal. Specifically:
    *   Conflicting testimonies regarding the location of the inventory (barangay hall vs. police station).
    *   Lack of all required witnesses (DOJ representative absent).
    *   Failure to photograph at the place of arrest.
    *   Insufficient justification for deviation from the procedure. The excuse of avoiding commotion was deemed unconvincing.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** Gaps in the chain of custody raise doubts about the integrity and identity of the seized drugs. These gaps include:
    *   Unclear sequence of events after seizure (barangay hall or police station first?).
    *   Lack of testimony on safekeeping of evidence after laboratory testing and retrieval for presentation in court.
*   **Presumption of Regularity Misapplication:** The RTC erred in applying the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty to excuse non-compliance with Section 21. The prosecution has the burden of proving compliance; the presumption cannot substitute for actual evidence.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mendoza (736 Phil. 749, 764 (2014)):** Emphasizes the importance of the presence of three witnesses to protect against evidence planting.
*   **Mallillin v. People (576 Phil. 576 (2008)):** Established a more exacting standard in authenticating narcotics evidence, requiring a complete chain of custody.
*   **People v. Mamangon (G.R. No. 229102, January 29, 2018):** Prosecutor has a positive duty to prove compliance with Section 21.
*   **People v. Alcala, People v. Mola, People v. Cornel, People v. Alviz, People v. Ramirez, People v. Saragena, People v. Miranda, People v. Paz, People v. Gajo, People v. Sagana** cited to highlight instances of non-compliance with Section 21, its implementing rules and regulations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "justifiable grounds" exception in the IRR of RA 9165 is a point of contention, as the prosecution's justifications are often weak and subject to judicial scrutiny. In this case, the excuse of avoiding "commotion" was deemed insufficient.
*   The separate concurring opinion points out the need for amendments to Section 21 and that the courts have the last say regarding the appreciation of evidence.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court correctly overturned the conviction due to the prosecution's failure to comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 21, RA 9165, and its implementing rules. The procedural lapses, gaps in the chain of custody, and misapplication of the presumption of regularity created reasonable doubt regarding the accused's guilt. This case reinforces the importance of strict adherence to the procedural safeguards in drug cases.
