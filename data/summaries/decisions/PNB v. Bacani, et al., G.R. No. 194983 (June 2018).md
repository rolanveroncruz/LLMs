**Legal Document Summary: Philippine National Bank v. Antonio Bacani, et al.**

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 194983, June 20, 2018 (3 Phil. 668)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision that nullified the sale of foreclosed property by PNB to a third party (Renato de Leon) and ordered PNB to reconvey the property to the former owners (Spouses Bacani).

**Key Issue:** Whether PNB fraudulently sold the foreclosed property to a third party despite the former owner's attempts to repurchase it, invoking PNB's internal policy (SEL Circular No. 8-7/89) granting priority to former owners.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* PNB's petition, *REVERSING* the CA and RTC decisions and *DISMISSING* the complaint.

**Key Provisions and Rationale:**

*   **Foreclosure and Consolidation of Title:** Upon the Spouses Bacani's failure to redeem the property within the statutory one-year period after the registration of the certificate of sale (Act No. 3135, Sec. 6), ownership validly consolidated in PNB. *Spouses Marquez v. Spouses Alindog*, 725 Phil. 237 (2014) reinforces the absolute ownership by the purchaser after the redemption period.
*   **PNB's Right to Dispose of Property:** As absolute owner, PNB possessed the right to dispose of the property under Article 428 of the Civil Code. The court cannot compel PNB to sell the property to any specific person.
*   **PNB SEL Circular No. 8-7/89:** This internal policy (not a statute or binding contract) gave priority to former owners *subject to conditions.* Since Spouses Bacani's offers consistently fell below PNB's total claim and the property's fair market value, PNB was not obligated to accept their offers.
*   **Repurchase vs. Redemption:** Spouses Bacani's offer was not redemption, but repurchase and is at the discretion of PNB. *GE Money Bank, Inc. v. Spouses Dizon*, 756 Phil. 502 (2015).
*   **No Legally Enforceable Right:** An internal policy (circular) generally doesn't create a legally demandable or enforceable right.
*   **Time Deposit:** The CA erred by considering the Spouses Bacani's time deposit as evidence of intent and capacity to repurchase because bank deposits create a debtor-creditor relationship and PNB could not appropriate the funds without violating its obligations. There was no option contract or perfected sale. *BPI Family Bank v. Franco*, 563 Phil. 495 (2007).
*   **No Fraud:** Spouses Bacani failed to prove fraud by clear and convincing evidence as required by *Spouses Galang v. Spouses Reyes,*, 692 Phil. 652 (2012) The publication of the Invitation to Bid was merely an invitation to make proposals, per Article 1326 of the Civil Code, and didn't obligate PNB to accept any particular bid.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   The Spouses Bacani had no remaining obligations once the redemption period expired.
*   PNB was not obligated to sell the property to the Spouses Bacani, as the conditions of the internal policy were not met.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The RTC and CA rulings, if upheld, could have unduly restricted the right of banks to dispose of foreclosed assets.
*   Reliance on internal policies by lower courts to overturn property rights would create uncertainty.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of PNB SEL Circular No. 8-7/89, particularly whether it created a legally enforceable right for former owners, were contentious.
*   The CA incorrectly implied a constructive trust based on perceived "bad faith," despite the absence of fraud.
