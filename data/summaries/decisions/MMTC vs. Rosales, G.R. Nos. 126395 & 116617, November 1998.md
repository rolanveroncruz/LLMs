## Legal Document Summary: *MMTC v. CA and Rosales (G.R. No. 116617 & 126395)*

**Nature:** Consolidated appeals from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification a Regional Trial Court (RTC) judgment finding Metro Manila Transit Corporation (MMTC) and its driver, Pedro Musa, liable for damages resulting from the death of Liza Rosalie Rosales due to reckless imprudence.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 2180, Civil Code (Vicarious Liability):**  MMTC, as employer, is primarily liable for Musa's negligence while acting within the scope of his duties. Obligation to prove "diligence of a good father of a family" in selection and supervision of employee ( *Bahia v. Litonjua*).
*   **Art. 2206, Civil Code (Damages for Death):**  Spouses Rosales are entitled to indemnity for death, actual damages, moral damages, and loss of earning capacity.
*   **Art. 2231, Civil Code (Exemplary Damages):**  Exemplary damages are recoverable due to Musa's gross negligence.
*   **Art. 2194, Civil Code (Solidary Liability):** MMTC and Musa are solidarily liable for the damages.

**Liabilities & Damages Awarded (Joint and Several against MMTC and Musa):**

*   **Death Indemnity:** P50,000.00
*   **Actual Damages:** P60,226.65 (Funeral expenses)
*   **Moral Damages:** P1,000,000.00 (Increased from lower courts)
*   **Exemplary Damages:** P500,000.00
*   **Attorney's Fees:** P50,000.00
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** P321,870.12 (Based on life expectancy and projected minimum wage)
*   **Costs of Suit:**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Burden of Proof (Diligence):**  MMTC failed to adequately prove the diligence of a good father of a family in selecting and supervising Musa.  Testimonial evidence alone was insufficient without supporting documentation (records of interview, examinations, performance, disciplinary actions, etc.). ( *Central Taxicab Corporation v. Ex-Meralco Employees Transportation Corporation*, *Metro Manila Transit Corp. v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Solidary Liability:**  MMTC's attempt to escape solidary liability failed due to insufficient proof of due diligence (*Gelisan v. Alday*, *Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, *Philtranco Service Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*).
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity (Minor):** Award for loss of earning capacity of a minor is justified, particularly given the evidence presented about the victim's aptitudes (academic achievements, artistic abilities, etc.) (*Haumersen v. Ford Motor Co.*, *Krohmer v. Dahl*).

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the liability of MMTC and Musa but modified the damages awarded, particularly increasing the moral damages. The decision emphasizes the employer's burden to prove due diligence in selecting and supervising employees and confirms solidary liability in quasi-delict cases involving public transportation. The GSIS was found not to be solidarily liable.
