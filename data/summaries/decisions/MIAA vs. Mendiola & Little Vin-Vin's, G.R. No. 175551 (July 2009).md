**Legal Document Summary: Republic vs. Mendiola, G.R. No. 175551 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari contesting the timeliness of the Republic's (MIAA) Notice of Appeal.

**Background:** MIAA (lessor) and Little Vin-Vin's Food Corporation (LVV, lessee) entered a Contract of Lease and Concessions. Disputes arose regarding electrical defects, unmet passenger forecasts, and exclusive operating rights. LVV filed complaints for specific performance and damages. The RTC issued several partial summary judgments.

**Key Provisions & Orders:**

*   **August 19, 2003 Order:** MIAA directed to rectify electrical defects and grant LVV an extension, absolving LVV from rental payments during the extension.
*   **April 26, 2004 Order:**  Ruled a breach of contract occurred, granting LVV a reduction in rental payments (suspended until determination of proportionate reduction) and nominal damages of Php 500,000.00.
*   **July 14, 2004 Order:** MIAA directed to offset electrical installation expenses against rentals.
*   **July 15, 2004 Order:** Allowed adherence to Administrative Order No. 1 series of 2000 for determining proportionate rent reduction.
*   **November 23, 2004 Order:** Noted LVV's Manifestation and Motion indicating it would no longer present evidence of lost earnings or attorney's fees.

**Issue:** Was MIAA's Notice of Appeal filed on time? The RTC and CA ruled it was filed out of time.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, holding MIAA's Notice of Appeal *was* timely.

**Reasoning (Key Legal Analysis):**

*   **Finality of Orders:** The SC held the July 15, 2004 Order was *not* a final judgment because issues of LVV's unearned earnings and attorney's fees remained unresolved. Citing *De la Cruz v. Paras* (G.R. No. L-41053), the SC reiterated that a final order is one that disposes of *all* the issues in the case. An order is interlocutory if it leaves substantial proceedings to be had.
*   **Premature Entry of Judgment:** Since the July 15, 2004 Order was interlocutory, its entry in the Book of Entries of Judgment on August 10, 2004 was premature and therefore, void.
*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** LVV's failure to appeal the April 26, 2004 Order (which awarded nominal damages) did not preclude it from presenting evidence on the remaining issues; it was an interlocutory order and therefore was not yet ripe for appeal.
*   **Resolution of All Issues:** It was only on November 23, 2004, when the trial court noted LVV's voluntary desistance from presenting evidence on unearned earnings and attorney’s fees, that all the issues were deemed disposed of. Consequently, MIAA's Notice of Appeal filed on December 15, 2004 was timely from receipt of the November 23, 2004 Order.

**Risks/Concerns:**

*   **Damages:** The case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to resolve MIAA's appeal, meaning the issue of MIAA's liability and the quantum of damages (specifically the Php 500,000.00 nominal damages and proportionate rent reduction) is still unresolved.
*   **Contract Interpretation:** The Court of Appeals will now have to address the underlying contractual issues, including the interpretation of the lease agreement, MIAA's obligations regarding electrical facilities, and the validity of LVV's claims regarding passenger forecasts and exclusive operating rights.
*   **Statutory References:**  Administrative Order No. 1, series of 2000, is implicated as the basis for proportionate rent reduction. The CA will need to review its applicability and legality in the context of the contract.

**Next Steps:** Court of Appeals will now hear the merits of MIAA’s appeal in light of the issues that were never heard by it due to the mistaken determination that the appeal was not filed on time.
