## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Conti v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 118464)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision on a petition for review on certiorari regarding an action for partition of real property.

**Key Issue:** Whether private respondents, claiming to be collateral heirs of Lourdes Sampayo, can demand partition of property co-owned by Sampayo and Ignacio Conti, without a prior settlement of Sampayo's estate.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding the right of the private respondents (Sampayo's collateral heirs) to demand partition under Art. 494 of the Civil Code. A prior settlement of the estate is not required in this case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 494, Civil Code:** Co-owner's right to demand partition. The court held that private respondents, as heirs, inherited Sampayo's right as co-owner and can exercise it.
*   **Art. 777, Civil Code:** Rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of death. This supports the court's finding that the heirs immediately acquired Sampayo's co-ownership rights.
*   **Rule 69, Sec. 1, Rules of Court:** Sets forth the rule on real estate partition. The Court clarified that this action is about partition between co-owners, not the partition of the *estate* of Lourdes Sampayo, therefore publication is not required.

**Filiation Issue:** Petitioners challenged the proof of filiation.

*   **Private Respondents Evidence:** Baptismal certificates and a photocopy of Manuel Sampayo's birth certificate (original destroyed in a fire) were presented as evidence, along with testimonial evidence.
*   **Art. 172, Family Code:** Used analogously to prove filiation.
*   **Admissibility of Baptismal Certificates:** The court cited *People v. Ritter* (G.R. No. 88582), stating they are admissible as entries made in the course of business under Sec. 43 of Rule 130 (exception to the hearsay rule).  They are evidence of the sacrament and were considered valid with corroborating evidence.
*  **Admissibility of Photocopy:** Loss of original birth certificate sufficiently established through certification from the civil registrar.
* **Argument by Petitioners:** Petitioners claimed that certification of non-availability of records and testimony about events before their birth were not sufficient.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for costs.
*   The order to submit a project of partition remains, requiring both parties to cooperate in dividing the property according to their respective rights.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Heirship:**  Although the court found sufficient evidence to prove the filiation, this is still the biggest weakness.
*   **Valuation/Appraisal of Property:** The exact value of the property and how it will be split is yet to be determined and could be a source of future litigation.
* **Contested Testimony:** Despite the court ruling, the testimonies were contested, potentially reopening issues should any inconsistencies or inaccuracies arise.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Hernandez v. Padua*** *(14 Phil. 194 [1909]) and Marabilles v. Quito (100 Phil. 64 [1956]):* Cited by the CA, establishes that a prior and separate judicial declaration of heirship is not necessary for demanding partition.
*   ***Ilustre v. Alaras Frondosa*** *(17 Phil. 321[1910]):* Property belongs to the heirs at the moment of death.
*   ***Quison v. Salud*** *(12 Phil. 109, 113-114 [1908]):* Affirms that a prior settlement of the estate is not required before heirs can commence action.
*   ***Roque v. IAC*** *(G.R. No. 75886, 30 August 1988, 165 SCRA 118, 125-126):* Clarifies the simultaneous issues in action of partition.
* ***People v. Ritter*** *(G.R. No. 88582, 5 March 1991, 194 SCRA 690, 705)* Cites *U.S. v. de Vera* (28 Phil. 105 [1914]) regarding the admissibility of baptismal certificates.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court effectively settled the issue of the private respondents' right to demand partition. The focus now shifts to implementing the partition itself. While the court deemed the evidence of heirship sufficient, any issues that can be raised to challenge this evidence, though unlikely to succeed, will affect the outcome of the case.
