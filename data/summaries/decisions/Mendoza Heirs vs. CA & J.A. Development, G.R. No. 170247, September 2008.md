## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Mendoza v. CA and J.A. Development Corp.*, G.R. No. 170247

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review)

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) had jurisdiction to reverse the lower courts' dismissal of an unlawful detainer complaint due to improper service of the petition for review on the party represented by counsel.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Improper Service:** SC held that the CA erred in proceeding with the case because J.A. Development Corp. served the petition for review and subsequent notices directly on Benjamin Mendoza, who was represented by counsel (Atty. Angeles), violating Rule 13, Section 2 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Service should have been on Atty. Angeles.
*   **Nullity of Proceedings:** Notice to the client, not the counsel of record, is not notice in law, rendering the CA proceedings flawed.
*   **Due Process Violation:** The improper service deprived the Mendozas of the opportunity to properly participate in the CA proceedings, thus violating due process.
*   **Remand:** Despite the Entry of Judgment in the CA, the SC reversed and set aside the CA decision and remanded the case for further proceedings, emphasizing the need to address the jurisdictional issue of the unlawful detainer case with proper notice and opportunity to be heard.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **J.A. Development Corp.:** Obligated to properly serve all pleadings and notices on the counsel of record for the Heirs of Mendoza in future proceedings. Potential liability for costs associated with re-litigation.
*   **Heirs of Mendoza:** Obligated to actively participate in the remanded proceedings before the CA, addressing the substantive issues of the unlawful detainer action.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **J.A. Development Corp.:** Risk of ultimately losing the unlawful detainer action if the MTCC determines it lacks jurisdiction or if the merits are decided against them. Further delays and legal expenses.
*   **Heirs of Mendoza:** Risk of ultimately being evicted from the property if the MTCC asserts jurisdiction and rules in favor of J.A. Development Corp. Possibility of being held liable for damages.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 13, Section 2, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Mandates service on counsel of record, not the party.
*   **Garrucho v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143791, 14 January 2005, 448 SCRA 165, 171-172; De Leon v. Court of Appeals, 432 Phil. 774 (2002):** Cited in relation to the legal precedent regarding service to counsel.
*   **Unlawful Detainer (Rule 70, Rules of Civil Procedure):** The underlying action at the MTCC.
*   **Act No. 1120 (Friar Land Act) and PD No.1529 (Property Registration Decree):** These laws are relevant as defenses of ownership were raised by the Mendozas.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether the MTCC had jurisdiction over the unlawful detainer case. The MTCC initially dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. It is unclear if the appellate court already resolved this or just stated that the prior case did not abate the case.
*   The 'Kasunduan' executed by Benjamin Mendoza. Its validity and effect on the rights of the Heirs of Mendoza is unclear. It acknowledges the ownership of J.A. Development Corporation, but it is unclear if this agreement is still valid and legally binding.
*   The issue of ownership is raised. It's unclear if the current appellate court has the power to rule regarding ownership.

**Conclusion:**

This decision primarily addresses a procedural defect (improper service) and its impact on due process. While the SC did not rule on the merits of the unlawful detainer case, it remanded it to the CA for further proceedings. The key risk lies in the potential jurisdictional issues of the unlawful detainer case at the MTCC, where the issue of ownership of the land is intertwined with the issue of possession. The CA will have to rule on the MTCC having jurisdiction. The validity of the `Kasunduan` may be pivotal, but the Mendozas may challenge its validity if they were not parties to the agreement.
