## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Tenorio* (G.R. No. 122098)

**Case Summary:**

This is an appeal from a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision convicting Felipe Tenorio (@ "Bino") of the complex crime of Murder with Frustrated Murder for an incident occurring on January 6, 1993. The RTC sentenced Tenorio to *reclusion perpetua* and ordered him to pay indemnity to the victim's heirs. The prosecution alleged that Tenorio, along with other NPA members, attacked the house of Jerson Candolita, resulting in the death of Minerva Gumboc and injuries to Jerson, Jovito, and Milagros Candolita.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Information:** Tenorio and Francisco Decenilla were charged with Murder with Multiple Frustrated Murders under Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code, alleging illegal possession of firearms, conspiracy, evident premeditation, treachery, and superior strength. Decenilla remains at large.
*   **Factual Basis:** The attack involved approximately 27 armed individuals, including Tenorio. Victims positively identified Tenorio.  Evidence included eyewitness testimonies, medical examinations documenting gunshot wounds and grenade injuries, and recovery of items from the house.
*   **Defense:** Tenorio claimed alibi, stating he was in Manila at the time of the incident.

**Obligations:**

*   Tenorio is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua* and pay the ordered indemnity to the heirs of Minerva Gumboc.

**Liabilities:**

*   Tenorio is held criminally liable for the death of Minerva Gumboc and the injuries inflicted upon Jerson, Jovito, and Milagros Candolita. His liability stems from his participation in a conspiracy with other NPA members.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Direct Evidence:** The Court acknowledges the lack of direct evidence specifically linking Tenorio to the fatal shots. His conviction relies heavily on conspiracy and collective responsibility for the acts of the group.
*   **Treachery:** The Supreme Court disagrees with the RTC's finding of treachery, arguing the victims were forewarned of the attack. The Court recognizes the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.
*   **Complex Crime:** The Solicitor General raises the question on why convict Tenorio of a Complex Crime (Murder with Frustrated Murder) given no proof exists that a single discharge caused the death and injuries. The court holds that the singular purpose of forcing Jerson Candolita and Ernesto de Juan to surrender is evidence of one complex crime.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conspiracy Inference:** The judgment notes that the RTC did not explicitly state that a conspiracy existed, but infers it from the concerted actions of the group. This reliance on implied conspiracy could be a point of contention, potentially requiring a more explicit demonstration of agreement among the perpetrators.
*   **Illegal Possession of Firearms:** Despite the initial information alleging illegal possession of firearms, the Court acknowledges the lack of evidence presented on this aspect.
