**Legal Document Summary: Cindy and Lynsy Garment vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 108369, January 7, 1998**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging NLRC decision affirming Labor Arbiter's ruling of illegal dismissal and monetary awards.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Finding of Illegal Dismissal:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the NLRC's finding that private respondents (promo girls) were illegally dismissed, rejecting the employer's (Cindy and Lynsy Garment) claim of abandonment.
*   **Reinstatement and Backwages:** The Labor Arbiter ordered reinstatement of the employees to their former positions and payment of backwages, 13th-month pay, service incentive leave pay, and salary differentials. This was upheld.
*   **Due Process:** The SC rejected the petitioner's claim that they were denied due process because their counsel failed to file a position paper. It noted that the petitioners were given ample time to file their position paper.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation to Reinstate:** Cindy and Lynsy Garment is obligated to reinstate the illegally dismissed promo girls (Erna N. Batalla, Cristina P. King, and Susan N. Caracas). Reinstatement is immediately executory. The employer has the option of payroll reinstatement pending appeal.
*   **Employer's Liability for Monetary Awards:** The employer is liable for backwages, 13th-month pay, service incentive leave pay, and salary differentials.
*   **Potential Penalties for Non-Compliance:** Failure to reinstate can result in penalties under RA 6715 (potentially P10,000 per payroll period).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute over Dismissal vs. Abandonment:** The core of the case revolves around whether the employees were dismissed or abandoned their work. The SC sided with the NLRC's finding of dismissal.
*   **Claim for Underpayment of Wages despite Amended Complaint:**  The SC ruled that even though the original complaint was amended to remove the claim for underpayment, the claim was still valid because the issue of the claim was clearly set forth.
*   **Alleged Denial of Due Process:** While the petitioner claimed denial of due process, the Court determined that they had ample opportunity to present their case, but failed to take advantage of it.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Requisites for Abandonment:** The court cites *Labor v. NLRC, 248 SCRA 183 (1995)*, *Jackson Building Condominium Corp. v. NLRC,. 246 SCRA 329 (1995)*; *See PASUDECO v. NLRC, G.R. No. 112650, May 29, 1997*, establishing the requirements for a finding of abandonment.
*   **Lack of Cause of Action:**  The court cites *Sumulong v. Court of Appeals, 232 SCRA 372 (1994)*.
*   **Due Process:** The court cites *Pakistan International Airlines Corporation v. Ople, 190 SCRA 90 (1990).*
*   **Rule 10, ยง5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Used in the decision relating to the underpayment of wages claim.
*   **RA 6715:** Refers to penalties for failure to comply with reinstatement orders.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of whether the underpayment of wages claim was properly raised due to the amended complaint.  While the Labor Arbiter and NLRC ruled in favor, the SC's reasoning, while ultimately upholding the decision, highlights a potentially contentious procedural issue regarding the effect of amending complaints.
