**Legal Document Summary: Astrid A. Van De Brug, et al. vs. Philippine National Bank (PNB)**

**Case:** G.R. No. 207004, June 6, 2018 (832 Phil. 432)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA Decision reversing an RTC decision in favor of Petitioners.

**Key Issue:** Whether the CA erred in failing to include sums accruing to PNB from DAR's payment for petitioners' properties in the loan recomputation under RA 7202, the Sugar Restitution Law.

**Background:**

*   Petitioners (Aguilars) are heirs of deceased spouses who had sugar crop loans with PNB.
*   Loans were secured by real estate mortgages and foreclosed in 1985.
*   RA 7202 (Sugar Restitution Law) enacted in 1992 aims to restitute losses suffered by sugar producers due to government actions. Aguilars sought to benefit.
*   PNB conveyed agricultural lands (collateral) to DAR under VOS (Voluntary Offer to Sell) and received payment from Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).
*   Aguilars sued PNB to compel application of LBP proceeds towards the loan, return of a residential property, and damages.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Aguilars, ordering PNB to apply VOS proceeds, deliver excess, and return residential lot, awarding damages for bad faith.
*   CA reversed, finding Aguilars entitled to RA 7202 benefits (recomputation) but no restitution because PNB's COA-audited recomputation showed no excess payment. CA held that the loan had already been fully paid "through foreclosure of collateral."

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 7202:**
    *   Section 3: Condonation of interest exceeding 12% p.a. and penalties for loans from Crop Year 1974-1975 to 1984-1985.
    *   Section 4: Applies to accounts fully/partially paid, restructured.  Excludes those with sequestration/ill-gotten wealth cases.
*   **Implementing Rules & Regulations (IRR) of RA 7202:**
    *   Sections 6, 7, 9: Defines recomputation, excess payments, and eligibility for restitution. It states that no excess payment exists since the recomputed interest rate at 12% p.a is higher than the original actual interest.
    *   Section 13: Entitlement to restitution for properties covered by CARL, with claims to be filed with BSP.
    *   **Foreclosure:** Under Section 6 of the IRR, in conjunction with Executive Order No. 31, a sugar producer who had loans fully paid through foreclosure of collateral is entitled to a recomputation, and the excess payment is applied as an offset and/or as payment for the producer’s outstanding loan obligations.
*   **Statement of Account:** Shows a principal of P270,351.62 for the RA 7202 accounts and an interest of P773,304.74 totaling P1,043,656.36. This shows the recomputed loan balance.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **PNB:**
    *   Potential liability for damages if proven to have acted in bad faith under Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code (abuse of rights). This is dependent on proof of: (a) a legal right or duty; (b) exercised in bad faith; (c) with sole intent to prejudice or injure another.
    *   Risk of being compelled to apply CARP/VOS proceeds to the loan balance *if* the Aguilars can demonstrate that the circumstances are substantially similar to the Pfleider case *and* PNB's different treatment is unjustified and malicious.
*   **Aguilars:**
    *   Risk of not receiving excess proceeds due to CA and Supreme Court ruling that LBP proceeds do not have to be credited to them under the RA 7202.
    *   Burden to prove PNB acted in bad faith to claim damages.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 7202 (Sugar Restitution Law):** The core statute in dispute.
*   **IRR of RA 7202:** Defines key terms and implements the law.
*   **Civil Code Articles 19 & 21:**  Basis for potential damages claim for abuse of rights.  *Velayo v. Shell Company of the Philippine Islands, Ltd.* and *Heirs of Purisima Nala v. Cabansag* are cited regarding the application of Articles 19 and 21.
*   **DOJ Opinion No. 91, Series of 1995:** Supports PNB's argument that RA 7202 doesn't undo completed foreclosure sales.
*   **Civil Case No. 7212 (Sps. Fred and Mildred Pfleider vs. PNB):**  The Aguilars attempt to use this case as precedent to demand similar treatment; but the Supreme Court determines they are distinct.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Excess Payment" under the IRR:**  The central point of contention.  The Aguilars argue for inclusion of LBP proceeds.
*   **Application of VOS proceeds:**  The Supreme Court emphasizes that a sugar producer who had loans fully paid through foreclosure of collateral is entitled to a recomputation, and the excess payment is applied as an offset and/or as payment for the producer’s outstanding loan obligations.

**Summary of the Supreme Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court sided with PNB, denying the Aguilars' petition and affirming the Court of Appeals’ decision. It ruled that the Aguilars failed to demonstrate PNB had a legal obligation to accord them the same treatment given to Spouses Pfleider and that there was no showing of malice on PNB’s part to justify an award of damages based on abuse of rights.
