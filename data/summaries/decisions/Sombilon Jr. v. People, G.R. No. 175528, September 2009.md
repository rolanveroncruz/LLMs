## Legal Document Summary: *PO3 Benito Sombilon, Jr. v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 175528, September 30, 2009)

**Case Overview:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Petitioner, PO3 Benito Sombilon, Jr., for the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 in relation to Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Incident:** Petitioner, a police officer, was convicted of acts of lasciviousness against a 15-year-old minor (AAA) during a theft investigation. Acts included touching her breasts, private parts, kissing her cheek, and asking her "Dalaga ka na ba?". Prior to the sexual harrasment there was also torture with the use of a gun on her head and electrocution on her fingers.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness with aggravating circumstance of abuse of public position. Sentenced to 6 months *arresto mayor* to 5 years, 4 months, and 21 days *prision correccional*. Ordered to pay moral damages (Php 10,000) and exemplary damages (Php 10,000).
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC conviction but modified the maximum penalty to 6 years of *prision correccional*. Upheld damages.

**Arguments on Appeal:**

*   Petitioner argued that the acts did not constitute lewdness (at most, unjust vexation) and denied intent.
*   Challenged the appreciation of the aggravating circumstance (abuse of public position) because it was not alleged in the Information.
*   Questioned the award of damages.

**Court's Holding & Rationale:**

*   **Guilty of Acts of Lasciviousness:** The Court affirmed the CA's finding of guilt. The acts constituted lewdness, demonstrating intent to gratify sexual desires, exceeding mere unjust vexation. The actions employed force and intimidation, negating the defense.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance:** The Court agreed that the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of public position could not be appreciated because it was not specifically alleged in the Information, citing Sections 8 and 9 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (effective Dec 1, 2000). This was applied retroactively to benefit the accused, citing *People v. Buayaban*.
*   **Penalty Modified:** Due to the absence of an aggravating circumstance, the penalty was modified under the Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) to 6 months *arresto mayor* to 4 years and 2 months *prision correccional*.
*   **Damages:**
    *   Exemplary Damages: The Court upheld exemplary damages, reasoning that the offense was committed before the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure took effect and therefore, the civil liability already incurred by appellant remains unaffected thereby.
    *   Moral Damages: Increased from Php 10,000 to Php 30,000, based on the victim's suffering and trauma, citing *People v. Solmoro*.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Retroactive Application:** The application of procedural rules retroactively creates the risk of future legal challenges based on similar factual patterns before and after procedural amendments. While in *Buayaban* it benefitted the accused, the Court declined to apply the 2000 Rules retroactively to affect the victim's vested rights to exemplary damages as discussed in *Catubig*.
*   **Subjectivity of "Lewdness":** As acknowledged by the Court, the determination of what constitutes "lewd conduct" is highly fact-dependent and can be open to interpretation.
*   **Vulnerability of Minors:** The inherent power dynamics in the police-minor relationship, coupled with the subjective nature of "lewdness", poses a continuous risk for similar offenses.
