**Case:** *Melody H. Santos v. Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr.* (A.C. No. 12353, February 06, 2024)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Emilio S. Paña, Jr. for violating the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) due to his participation in securing falsified court documents related to a marriage annulment.

**Key Provisions/Obligations Violated:**

*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Violation of the oath to do no falsehood and not consent to the doing of any in court.
*   **CPRA:** Violations of Canon II (Propriety), specifically Sections 1 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct), 2 (respect for the law and court processes), 5 (observance of fairness), and 8 (prohibition against misleading the court); Canon III (Fidelity), specifically Section 2 (responsible and accountable lawyer upholding the constitution and obeying the laws).  A.M. No. 22-09-01-SC, specifically Section 33(b), Canon VI (falsification of documents is a serious offense). Section 37(a).
*   **Former CPR equivalents** Rule 1.01, Canon 1 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct); Rule 7.03, Canon 7 (conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice law); Rule 10.01, Canon 10 (not doing any falsehood).

**Liabilities/Findings:**

*   **Substantial Evidence:** The Court found substantial evidence that Atty. Paña received PHP 280,000.00 from the complainant, Melody H. Santos, to secure a quick annulment.
*   **Facilitation of Falsification:** While Atty. Paña argued that his only error was referring the complainant to a third party (Guillermo), the Court found he facilitated the procurement of a spurious judgment and certificate of finality.
*   **Knowledge of Irregularity:** Evidence, including email correspondence, showed Atty. Paña was aware of the irregular procedures being employed.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Referral Defense:** Atty. Paña's defense that he merely referred the complainant to a third party was unsuccessful. His involvement extended beyond a mere referral.
*   **Reliance on Third-Party Actions:** A lawyer cannot shield themselves from liability by claiming ignorance of or non-involvement in the specific falsification act if they knowingly benefited from or facilitated the overall scheme.
*   **CPRA application:**  Court affirmed that the new CPRA law was applicable as the exceptions are not present in the case.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Office of the Court Administrator v. Indar*, 685 Phil. 272 (2012): Confirms the disbarment of Judge Indar, the supposed signatory of the falsified judgment.
*   *Reyes, Jr. v. Rivera*, 887 Phil. 247 (2020): Disbarment for furnishing a client with a fake court decision.
*   *Madria v. Rivera*, 806 Phil. 774 (2017): Disbarment for providing a client with a fake court decision and certificate of finality.
*   *Drilon v. Maglalang*, A.C. No. 8471, August 22, 2023: Disbarment for authorship and use of a forged court order, specifically involving an annulment case.

**Conclusion:**

The Court, aligning with precedent, considered Atty. Paña's actions a serious ethical violation warranting disbarment. The case emphasizes an attorney's duty to uphold the integrity of the legal system and to avoid any participation in falsifying court documents, even indirectly through referrals, which undermines the administration of justice.
