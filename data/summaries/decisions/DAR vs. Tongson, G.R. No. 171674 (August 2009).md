**Case Summary: *Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) vs. Carmen S. Tongson* (G.R. No. 171674, August 4, 2009)**

**Core Issue:** Determination of just compensation for agricultural lands acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27) where compensation was not settled prior to the enactment of Republic Act No. 6657 (RA 6657), the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.

**Holding:** RA 6657, not PD 27, governs the determination of just compensation in this case.  PD 27 and EO 228 (implementing PD 27) have suppletory application only.  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, but remanded the case to the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) for reception of evidence specifically regarding the date of issuance of Emancipation Patents (EPs).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PD 27 vs. RA 6657:** PD 27 uses a formula based on 2.5 times the average harvest of three normal crop years to determine land value. RA 6657 (Section 17) considers a broader range of factors including current market value of similar properties, nature, actual use, income, owner's valuation, tax declarations, government assessments, social and economic benefits, and non-payment of taxes/loans.
*   **Just Compensation:** The Court reiterated that just compensation must be the full and fair equivalent of the property at the time of the taking, emphasizing the *Land Bank v. Natividad* ruling that RA 6657 is especially imperative for this reason.
*   **Date of Taking:** The "taking" of the land for purposes of computing just compensation is reckoned from the date of issuance of the Emancipation Patents (EPs), relying on *Land Bank v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo*.
*   **Obligation to Pay:** DAR is obligated to pay just compensation to Tongson for the land acquired. The amount will be determined by the SAC, guided by RA 6657 and the date of EP issuance.

**Liabilities:**

*   DAR's primary liability is the payment of just compensation determined under RA 6657, plus legal interest from the date of taking (EP issuance).
*   Potential liability for failing to provide adequate notice to Tongson of the acquisition proceedings, though this issue seems secondary to the primary question of valuation.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Undetermined EP Dates:**  The lack of concrete evidence regarding the exact dates of the EP issuance poses a significant risk. The SAC will need to establish these dates, as they directly impact the final valuation.
*   **Valuation Disputes:**  Even with RA 6657 guidelines, the valuation of the land remains contentious. Disagreements over comparable properties, market data, and the interpretation of Section 17 factors are likely.
*   **Interest Calculation:** The precise method for calculating legal interest from the date of taking until full payment could be subject to further dispute and clarification by the SAC.

*   **PD 27:** Tenants Emancipation Decree
*   **EO 228:** Implementing guidelines for PD 27 valuation
*   **RA 6657:** Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (CARL)

*   ***Land Bank v. Natividad***:  Landmark case emphasizing RA 6657's importance in achieving full and fair just compensation.
*   ***Land Bank v. Heirs of Angel T. Domingo***: Defines the date of EP issuance as the "taking" for just compensation purposes.
*   ***Land Bank v. Carolina B. Vda. de Abello, et al.*** and ***Land Bank v. Josefina Dumlao, et al.***: Establishing the precedence of RA 6657 over PD 27 in unfinished agrarian reform cases.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contention revolves around which legal framework (PD 27 vs. RA 6657) should be applied to determine just compensation. The Court definitively ruled in favor of RA 6657.

**Recommendations:**

*   Thoroughly investigate and document the exact dates of issuance for all relevant Emancipation Patents.
*   Prepare expert testimony regarding land valuation, focusing on comparable properties and market data relevant to the dates of EP issuance.
*   Anticipate potential challenges related to interest calculation and ensure compliance with applicable legal rates.
