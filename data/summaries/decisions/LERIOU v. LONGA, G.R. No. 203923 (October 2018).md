Okay, here's a legal summary of *G.R. No. 203923, October 08, 2018*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Iona Leriou, Eleptherios L. Longa, and Stephen L. Longa v. Yohanna Frenesi S. Longa and Victoria Ponciana S. Longa*

**Summary:**

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's denial of the petitioners' Omnibus Motion to remove Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz (respondent-administratrix) as administratrix of the intestate estate of Enrique Longa, and to appoint Eleptherios L. Longa (petitioner) or his nominee as administrator.  The minors Yohanna and Victoria Longa, represented by their mother, Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz, initiated the intestate proceedings. The petitioners, legitimate children of the deceased, contested the appointment of the respondent-administratrix, the mother of the illegitimate children, arguing lack of notice, misrepresentation, and their preferential right to administer. The Court of Appeals and RTC rejected these arguments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Appointment of Administratrix:** The RTC appointed Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz as administratrix. Her obligations include submitting inventory, managing the estate in the best interest of the deceased, rendering accounts, and performing all orders of the court as outlined in the Order dated November 5, 2007.
*   **Notice to Heirs (Rules 76, Sections 3 & 4):** Petitioners argued lack of due process due to failure to receive notice. The Court held that while personal notice to known heirs is required by Section 4 of Rule 76, it's a matter of procedural convenience, not a jurisdictional requirement (citing *Alaban v. Court of Appeals*, 507 Phil. 682, 695 (2005)). Publication of the notice under Section 3 is considered sufficient notice to the whole world for in rem proceedings, vesting the court with jurisdiction.
*   **Order of Preference for Administrator (Rule 78, Section 6):** Petitioners claimed a superior right as legitimate children. The Court emphasized the *Gabriel v. Court of Appeals*, 287 Phil. 459, 466-467 (1992) ruling, stating the interest in the estate is the principal consideration, not just the order of preference.
*   **Competency to Serve as Administrator (Rule 78, Section 1):** The Court noted Eleptherios L. Longa's ineligibility to serve as administrator as he is a non-resident of the Philippines.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Administratrix's Duties:** The respondent-administratrix has a fiduciary duty to manage the estate responsibly. Failure to do so could lead to removal under Rule 82, Section 2 for neglect, failure to perform orders, absconding, or becoming unsuitable.
*   **Potential for Waste/Mismanagement:** The Court considered the risk of mismanagement, which partly influenced its decision to uphold the appointment of Sta. Cruz, as she was seen as protecting her children's interests.
*   **Bond Requirements:** The court did not find that the administratrix needed to pay guardianship bond under Sec. 16 A.M. No. 03-02-05-SC Rule on Guardianship of Minors, before she could discharge her functions.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Sufficiency of Notice:** The main contention was whether the electronic mails and the filing of the order at the DFA constitutes official notice to the petitioners heirs.
*   **The Forum Shopping Issue:** The Supreme Court noted the technical issue with the Petition due to the forum shopping certification not being signed by the petitioners.
*   **Pauper Litigant Status:** Petitioners challenged the respondent-administratrix's claim as a pauper litigant, which the court dismissed.
*   **Preferential Right:** Disregarding petitioners’ preferential right due to the court’s recognition that the respondent-administratrix interest is to protect the minors interests.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rules 76, 78, 79, 82:** Governing probate proceedings, appointment/removal of administrators, and notice requirements.
*   **Alaban v. Court of Appeals, 507 Phil. 682 (2005):**  Cited regarding the nature of notice in probate proceedings (procedural convenience vs. jurisdictional requisite) and the effect of publication.
*   **Gabriel v. Court of Appeals, 287 Phil. 459 (1992):**  Cited regarding the principal consideration in appointing an administrator (interest in the estate).
*   **Uy v. Court of Appeals, 519 Phil. 673, 680 (2006).** Cited on the Order of Preference in the appointment of an administrator depends on the attendant facts and circumstances.
*   **Pilapil v. Heirs of Maximino R. Briones, 543 Phil. 184, 199 (2007).** Cited on the principle that the settlement of estate, whether testate or intestate, is a proceeding in rem.
*   **A.M. No. 03-02-05-SC Rule on Guardianship of Minors, Sec. 16.** Not required to pay guardianship bond under the said rule.

**Potential Risks for Petitioners (Iona, Eleptherios, Stephen):**

*   **Continued Administration by Sta. Cruz:** Sta. Cruz remains in control of the estate, potentially prioritizing the interests of her children over the legitimate heirs.
*   **Non-Resident Status:** Eleptherios' non-resident status permanently disqualifies him from serving as administrator.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision upholding the RTC's appointment of Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz. The decision emphasizes the importance of interest in the estate when appointing an administrator and reiterates that publication of notice is sufficient for in rem probate proceedings. While the legitimate children have a preferential right, the court has discretion based on the suitability and interest of the parties involved.
