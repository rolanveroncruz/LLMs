**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Aquil Pilpa y Dipaz*, G.R. No. 225336, September 05, 2018 (839 Phil. 1011)

**Summary:** This is an appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Aquil Pilpa for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) for the stabbing death of Dave Alde. The Supreme Court (SC) partially granted the appeal, modifying the conviction to Homicide under Article 249 of the RPC.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Information:** Pilpa was charged with Murder, alleging conspiracy with others, treachery, and evident premeditation.
*   **Conspiracy:** The SC affirmed the lower courts' finding of conspiracy based on the concerted actions of Pilpa and "JR" before, during, and after the stabbing, demonstrating a unity of purpose. The attempt of Pilpa to stab Alde, even after JR had already stabbed him, proves their concerted action and intent, such that the crime had not yet been consummated.
*   **Treachery:** The SC reversed the lower courts' finding of treachery. The SC held that the attack's suddenness alone is insufficient to establish treachery.  The prosecution failed to demonstrate that the mode of attack was deliberately chosen to ensure the crime's execution without risk to the assailants, especially given the victim was with friends in a public place. The frontal nature of the attack also weighs against a finding of treachery (citing *People v. Tugbo, Jr.*).
*   **Crime:** Due to the absence of treachery, the crime is Homicide, not Murder (Article 249, RPC).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Pilpa:** Found guilty of Homicide.  Sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*.
*   **Pilpa:**  Ordered to pay the heirs of Dave Alde P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as temperate damages.  All monetary awards to earn 6% interest per annum from finality.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **No specific mention of "JR's" conviction, creating a potential for future legal complications if "JR" is later apprehended and tried.**
