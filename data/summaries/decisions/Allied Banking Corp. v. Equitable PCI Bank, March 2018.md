Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *Allied Banking Corporation v. Steel Corporation of the Philippines*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Allied Banking Corporation v. Steel Corporation of the Philippines* G.R. No. 191939, March 14, 2018

**Facts:** Equitable PCI Bank (EPCIB) filed a petition to place Steel Corporation of the Philippines (SCP) under corporate rehabilitation due to financial difficulties.  Allied Banking Corporation (ABC) had extended a revolving credit facility to SCP, secured by a trust receipt (TR) agreement allowing ABC to charge SCP's account upon events like insolvency. After the RTC issued a stay order in the rehabilitation proceedings, ABC applied funds from SCP's account towards SCP's obligations under the TR.  SCP argued this violated the stay order.

**Issue:**  The primary issue is whether the RTC correctly ordered ABC to restore funds to SCP's account, effectively invalidating ABC's set-off, given that the set-off occurred after the RTC issued the stay order but before its publication.  Related issues are whether the order impaired ABC's contractual rights and whether ABC was deprived of due process.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *denied* ABC's petition, upholding the CA and RTC rulings.

**Key Provisions and Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Retroactive Effect of Commencement Order (Rehabilitation Rules):**  The Court applied the *Financial Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure* (Rehabilitation Rules), enacted *after* the initial filing but applicable to pending cases unless infeasible or unjust.  The Rehabilitation Rules' "commencement order," analogous to the stay order in this case, retroacts to the date the rehabilitation petition was filed.  This renders void any set-off made after the filing date. *Section 9, Rule 2 of the Rehabilitation Rules* specifically nullifies set-offs after the commencement date.
*   **Immediate Effectivity of Stay Order (Interim Rules):** Even under the *Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation* (Interim Rules), which were in effect when the petition was filed, the stay order is effective from the date of *issuance* and is immediately executory, per *Section 11, Rule 4 and Sec. 5, Rule III of the Interim Rules*.
*   **Validity of Actions Inconsistent with Stay Order:** The court emphasized the objective of rehabilitation proceedings â€“ to preserve the debtor's assets and give it an opportunity to reorganize.  Allowing creditors to take action after the stay order is issued, even before publication, would frustrate this purpose.  *Sec. 8 of the Interim Rules* empowers the court to void any transaction made in violation of the stay order.
*   **Publication Requirement:** The publication requirement serves to provide notice to all affected parties to satisfy due process. However, the immediate effectivity of the stay order allows the court to invalidate actions taken *after issuance* of the stay order but *before publication*, to protect the debtor's assets.
*   **No Impairment of Contract:** The Court held that the Trust Receipt Agreement was subject to existing laws, including those allowing for corporate rehabilitation. The stay order didn't eliminate SCP's debt to ABC, but merely suspended its enforcement temporarily. Citing *Golden Merchandising Corporation v. Equitable PCI Bank*, the Court noted that modifying the time for exercising a right (i.e., enforcement of debt) does not constitute an impairment of contract.
*   **No Due Process Violation:** Rehabilitation proceedings are *in rem*, and jurisdiction is acquired upon publication, binding all parties. ABC was notified of the proceedings and filed a comment, thus satisfying due process requirements.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **ABC's Obligation:** ABC was obligated to comply with the stay order from the date of its issuance.
*   **ABC's Liability:** ABC was liable to restore the funds set off from SCP's account.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Retroactive Application of Rehabilitation Rules:**  The contentious aspect revolved around the retroactive application of the Rehabilitation Rules, potentially altering the rights and obligations that existed under the prior Interim Rules.  The court justified this application by emphasizing the purpose of rehabilitation and deeming it feasible and just in this context.
*   **Immediate Effectivity vs. Publication:** The tension between the immediate effectivity of the stay order and the due process requirement of publication was a key point. The court resolved this by arguing that the stay order's immediate effect is necessary to protect the debtor's assets, while publication serves as notice to affected parties for ongoing proceedings.
*   **Trust Receipt Agreement Terms:** ABC argued that the terms of the trust receipt allowed them to take action in the event of insolvency. However, the court ruled that such terms are subject to the overarching legal framework of corporate rehabilitation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 10142 (FRIA)
*   2000 Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC)
*   Financial Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure (A.M. No. 12-12-11-SC)

*   *Golden Merchandising Corporation v. Equitable PCI Bank*, 706 Phil. 427 (2013)

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court prioritized the policy of corporate rehabilitation and upheld the lower court's decision invalidating the bank's set-off. This decision reinforces the immediate effectivity of stay orders in rehabilitation proceedings, even prior to publication, and emphasizes that contracts are subject to existing laws regarding corporate rehabilitation.
