**Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc. v. National Labor Union and National Labor Relations Commission*, G.R. No. 115414, August 25, 1998 (356 Phil. 63)**

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari challenging the NLRC's decision that declared a retrenchment invalid.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Retrenchment (Art. 283 Labor Code):** Employer's right to terminate employment due to financial difficulties, subject to conditions.
*   **Notice Requirement (Art. 283 Labor Code):** One-month prior written notice to employees and DOLE.
*   **Separation Pay (Art. 283 Labor Code):** Entitlement based on years of service.
*   **Criteria for Valid Retrenchment:**
    *   Substantial and imminent losses (Sebuguero v. NLRC, Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers).
    *   Necessity and measure of last resort (Lopez Sugar).
    *   Sufficient proof of losses (Lopez Sugar).
    *   Fair and reasonable criteria in selecting employees (Asiaworld Publishing House, Inc. v. Ople):
        *   Less preferred status (e.g., temporary employee)
        *   Efficiency rating
        *   **Seniority**

**Liabilities:**

*   NLRC decision held the retrenchment of 38 employees was invalid.
*   Ordered reinstatement of those 38 employees and payment of backwages.
*   PTSI is liable for backwages and potentially other damages if reinstatement is not feasible.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Invalid Retrenchment:** NLRC found the failure to consider seniority as a factor in employee selection rendered the retrenchment invalid.
*   **Unfair Labor Practice:** Union initially alleged unfair labor practice, although the court limited the scope of review based on the petitioner's action.
*   **Backpay Liability:** Significant financial liability if reinstatement is ordered and backwages are substantial.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 283:** Governs termination of employment due to retrenchment.
*   **Labor Code, Art. 278:** Fiscal measures available to both profit and non-profit entities.
*   **Sebuguero v. NLRC, 248 SCRA 532 (1995):** Defines retrenchment.
*   **Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers, 189 SCRA 170 (1990):** Outlines limitations on employer's prerogative to layoff employees.
*   **Asiaworld Publishing House, Inc. v. Ople, 152 SCRA 219 (1987):** Establishes criteria for fair employee selection in retrenchment.
*   **Villena vs. NLRC, 193 SCRA 686 (1991):** Importance of seniority as factor in retrenchment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjective Criteria:** PTSI used "dependability, adaptability, trainability, job performance, and attitude towards work" in its employee selection process.  These are highly subjective and provide potential grounds for claims of discrimination or arbitrary action, especially when seniority is ignored.
*   **Proof of Financial Losses:** While NLRC accepted PTSI's evidence of financial distress, the union disputed the validity of the retrenchment claiming that the Society has "many real estate properties and assets to pay benefits to retiring and separated employees."
*   **Quitclaims:** While 78 employees signed quitclaims, the NLRC's initial decision ordering reinstatement suggests potential issues regarding the validity and voluntariness of those quitclaims. (This point was not actively litigated in the certiorari action brought by PTSI.)

**Conclusion:**

PTSI's failure to adequately consider seniority in its retrenchment plan, despite establishing financial difficulties, exposed it to liability. While the finding of financial distress was upheld, the procedural defect in employee selection was fatal to the validity of the retrenchment.  The subjective criteria used lacked transparency and provide a basis for allegations of unfairness and discrimination, particularly in light of disregarded seniority.
