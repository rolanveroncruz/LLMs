**Case Summary: People v. Mateo, G.R. No. 179036 (2008)**

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction of Carlito Mateo for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Section 5 Violation (Illegal Sale):**  Mateo was convicted of selling 0.10 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) for P200.00 during a buy-bust operation.
*   **Section 11 Violation (Illegal Possession):** Mateo was also convicted of possessing 0.2 grams of shabu.  The possession charge stemmed from seven additional sachets of shabu found on Mateo during the arrest, beyond the single sachet involved in the sale.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** MADAC operatives, acting on a tip, conducted a buy-bust operation where Mateo sold shabu to a poseur-buyer (MADAC Operative Fari√±as). Backup officers were present and arrested Mateo after the sale.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the testimony of the poseur-buyer, backup officers, the seized drugs (marked with "CMP" for Carlito Mateo Patawid), and the forensic report confirming the substance was methamphetamine hydrochloride.
*   **Defense:** Mateo claimed he was merely walking when apprehended and framed.  He alleged he was taken to a room and his picture taken with drugs he had never seen before.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Evidence was marked, inventoried and was taken to the DEU office.  Thereafter, the accused was taken to the DEU and afterwards to the PNP Crime Laboratory for drug testing. The drugs were examined and confirmed to contain methamphetamine hydrochloride.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Mateo):**  Liability for illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs under R.A. 9165.
*   **Law Enforcement (MADAC/PNP):** Obligation to adhere to proper procedures in buy-bust operations and evidence handling (chain of custody).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Accused Argument: Insufficient Surveillance:** Mateo argued the lack of prior surveillance invalidated the buy-bust. The Court cited *People v. Tranca* to note that prior surveillance is not a mandatory prerequisite if the police reasonably believe time is of the essence.
*   **Accused Argument: Inconsistent Testimony:** Mateo claimed inconsistencies in the prosecution's witnesses' testimonies. The Court ruled that the inconsistencies were minor and did not undermine the credibility of the witnesses.
*   **Chain of Custody:** While not specifically argued as deficient, the chain of custody is always a potential point of attack in drug cases.  The documentation and handling of evidence from seizure to testing must be meticulously established to prevent challenges to its admissibility.
*   **Lack of Counsel:** The legal document doesn't explicitly mention whether the accused was assisted by counsel during his arrest.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Sections 5 and 11, defining and penalizing illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **People v. Tranca, G.R. No. 110357 (1994):**  Established that prior surveillance is not strictly required for a valid buy-bust operation.
*   **People v. Macabalang, G.R. No. 168694 (2006):** Outlines the elements for the successful prosecution of illegal sale cases: identities of the buyer and seller, object, consideration, and the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.
*   **R.A. 9346 ("An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines"):** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, altering the possible sentencing under Section 5.
* Indeterminate Sentence Law- accused-appellant is sentenced to twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to twenty (20) years, as maximum.

**Court Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, upholding Mateo's conviction.
*   The Court relied on the positive identification of Mateo by the poseur-buyer, the recovered drugs, and the forensic analysis.  The Court applied the presumption of regularity to the actions of law enforcement.
*   The Court modified the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 03-2338 (illegal possession), making the prison term indeterminate (12 years and one day, as minimum, to twenty (20) years, as maximum), while affirming the fine.

**Potential Legal Strategy (Defense):**

Focus on inconsistencies in the testimonies of the policemen. While the court dismissed them as minor, there is a potential for them to be re-analyzed. Chain of custody and the way items were brought to the PNP crime laboratory is another point of attack.
