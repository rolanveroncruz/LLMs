**Case Summary: *Lampesa v. De Vera, Jr.*, G.R. No. 155111 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for review on certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) decision holding petitioners (truck owner Lampesa and truck driver Copsiyat) liable for damages resulting from a quasi-delict.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 2176 of the Civil Code (Quasi-Delict):**  Driver Copsiyat found negligent in maneuvering a truck, causing injury to passenger De Vera, Jr. This negligence forms the basis of the quasi-delict.
*   **Article 2180 of the Civil Code (Employer's Liability):** Truck owner Lampesa held solidarily liable due to failure to exercise due diligence in the *selection and supervision* of his driver, Copsiyat. The case reiterates that merely checking for a professional driver's license is insufficient; further investigation into the driver's qualifications, experience and record of service is required.  The burden of proof is on the employer to prove they exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision.
*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:**  The RTC, affirmed by the CA, held Copsiyat and Lampesa *jointly and solidarily* liable for damages.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Moral Damages:** Awarded to De Vera, Jr. due to physical injuries sustained as a result of the quasi-delict. Article 2219 (2) supports this.
*   **Actual Damages:** Awarded to compensate for losses incurred.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded due to the need for the plaintiff to litigate as a result of the defendant's failure to settle despite demand (Article 2208 (2)).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Dispute Regarding Negligence:** Petitioners argued the jeepney driver was negligent, not Copsiyat. However, both lower courts found Copsiyat negligent, and the Supreme Court upheld these factual findings, invoking the general rule that it does not re-weigh evidence already considered by lower courts.  This highlights the risk of relying on a factual defense already rejected by the lower courts.
*   **Insufficient Proof of Due Diligence:** The greatest risk for Lampesa was his failure to provide concrete evidence of due diligence in selecting and supervising Copsiyat. Bare allegations were insufficient. *Yambao v. Zuñiga* is cited as precedent for the required level of diligence.
*   **Failure to Raise Issue on Appeal:** The Supreme Court noted that the petitioners could not challenge the award of moral damages and attorney’s fees because they failed to raise this issue before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Solidary Liability:** Lampesa's biggest legal risk is the solidary liability with the driver, potentially exposing him to the entire amount of damages even if Copsiyat is unable to pay.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2176, Civil Code:** Basis for quasi-delict liability.
*   **Article 2180, Civil Code:** Defines employer's vicarious liability for employee's negligence.
*   **Article 2217, Civil Code:** Authorizes moral damages.
*   **Article 2208, Civil Code:** Justifies award of attorney's fees.
*   **Article 2219, Civil Code:** Justifies award of moral damages where there is quasi-delict causing physical injury.
*    ***Yambao v. Zuñiga, G.R. No. 146173, December 11, 2003***: Case cited to demonstrate standard of diligence required of employers in employee selection and supervision.
*   **Laguna Tayabas Bus Co. v. Tiongson, et al., No. L-22143, April 30, 1966:** Relevant jurisprudence justifying attorney's fees.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The determination of negligence itself is inherently fact-specific and potentially contentious, relying heavily on witness testimony and evidence presented.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's decision, finding the truck driver negligent and the truck owner vicariously liable due to insufficient evidence of due diligence in selecting and supervising his employee. The solidary liability places the truck owner at significant financial risk. The failure to raise issues in the CA precluded their consideration by the Supreme Court.
