## Legal Document Summary: *Amado De Guzman vs. Court of Appeals and Nasipit Lumber Company* (G.R. No. 132257)

**Core Issue:** Prescription of money claims arising from a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that the petitioners' claim for optional retirement and separation benefits under the CBA had prescribed. The applicable prescriptive period is three years under Article 291 of the Labor Code, not ten years under Article 1144 of the Civil Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **CBA:** The petitioners based their claim on provisions within the CBA regarding optional retirement (Article V Section 12(a)) and separation assistance grants (Article V Section 13).
*   **Article 291, Labor Code:** Mandates a three-year prescriptive period for all money claims arising from employer-employee relations.
*   **Article 1144, Civil Code:** Prescribes a ten-year period for actions based on written contracts.
*   **Article 261, Labor Code:** Confers original and exclusive jurisdiction on Voluntary Arbitrators to hear and decide grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of a CBA.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent, Nasipit Lumber Company, was initially found liable by the Voluntary Arbitrator for optional retirement and separation benefits.
*   However, the Court of Appeals overturned this, finding that the claim had prescribed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Error:** The initial filing of the claim with the NLRC, instead of directly with the Voluntary Arbitrator, was a critical error that did not interrupt the prescriptive period. This highlights the importance of correctly identifying the proper forum. The case implies that any action before a court lacking jurisdiction does not interrupt the statute of limitations. *Rances v. NLRC* is cited as relevant precedent.
*   **Interpretation of "Money Claims":** The petitioners argued that Article 291 only applies to claims recoverable under the Labor Code, not those arising from a CBA. The Court rejected this narrow interpretation, holding that Article 291 covers *all* money claims arising from the employer-employee relationship. *Uy v. NLRC* and *Cadalin v. POEA* are cited.
*   **Interruption of Prescription:** The Court considered whether the letters of demand from the Union interrupted the running of the prescriptive period. It concluded they did not as they were premature, being dated before the actual dismissal (the date the cause of action accrued). The court also implied that in absence of a Labor Code provision for determining when the prescriptive period may be interrupted, Article 1155 of the Civil Code may be used.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the critical importance of adhering to the prescriptive periods established in the Labor Code for money claims. Incorrectly choosing the forum for the complaint and failing to act within the three-year window resulted in the forfeiture of the petitioners' rights to claim benefits under the CBA.
