Here's a legal summary of the *Great Southern Maritime Services Corp. v. Surigao*, G.R. No. 183646, September 18, 2009 case:

**Case Summary:**

This is a petition for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the NLRC and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision awarding death benefits to the respondents, the heirs of seafarer Salvador Surigao. The Supreme Court (SC) granted the petition, reversing the CA and reinstating the NLRC decision that denied death benefits.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **POEA Standard Employment Contract (SEC):**  The contract incorporated the POEA SEC. Relevant provisions are Section 20(A) regarding death benefits (US$50,000 + US$7,000/child, max 4) and Section 20(D) which states that no compensation is payable if death results from the seafarer's "willful or criminal act" and the employer proves a direct causal link.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The SC reiterated that the employer bears the burden of proving that the seafarer's death was due to a willful act (suicide).
*   **Financial Assistance:** The NLRC had ordered the petitioner to grant financial assistance to the complainants in the amount of Five Thousand Dollars (US$5,000.00) which was reinstated in the decision of the SC.

**Liabilities:**

*   The petitioners' liability for death benefits hinges on whether they could sufficiently prove that Salvador Surigao committed suicide. The SC ultimately found that they did provide sufficient evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Suicide:** The core issue is whether the evidence presented sufficiently proves suicide. The Labor Arbiter and the CA initially found the evidence insufficient, speculating about alternative scenarios.  The SC, however, found the combined evidence persuasive, rejecting the speculative reasoning of the lower tribunals. The conflicting interpretations of the evidence demonstrate the inherent contentiousness of the case.
*   **Case Law:** While the SC acknowledged *Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc. v. Cuaresma*, it distinguished the present case based on the specificity of the post-mortem report identifying asphyxia due to hanging as the cause of death.
*   **Evidence:** Key evidence included: Death Certificate, Post-Mortem Certificate, Indian Police Inquest Report, nurse's affidavit, and photos of the scene. The weight and interpretation of this evidence were central to the dispute.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Issues:**

*   The finding of the deceased lying on the floor with the belt around his neck, and the broken showerhead near his body were ambiguous. The Labor Arbiter construed these facts to negate suicide. The SC interpreted the evidence as consistent with a death by hanging where the support structure failed.
