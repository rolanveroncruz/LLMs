**Case:** *Manuel B. Trovela v. Michael B. Robles, et al.* (A.C. No. 11550, June 04, 2018)

**Summary:**

This is a disbarment complaint filed by Manuel B. Trovela against several government prosecutors (Robles, Obu√±gen, Ang, Arellano) and a former Secretary of Justice (De Lima) for alleged errors and delays in handling his estafa complaint against third parties. Trovela argues that the prosecutors erred in dismissing his complaint for insufficiency of evidence and that Arellano and De Lima caused inordinate delays in resolving his petitions for review and motion for reconsideration. Trovela alleges violations of Article 208 of the RPC, R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), and the canons of legal ethics.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Estafa Complaint:** The underlying issue is the dismissal of Trovela's estafa complaint under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Resolutions and Review:** Complainant is alleging there was error and/or delay in the dismissal of the complaint and the affirmation of the dismissal in petitions for review and motions for reconsideration at the DOJ.
*   **Reliefs Sought:** The complainant is seeking disciplinary action, including disbarment and/or removal from office, referral for prosecution under Article 208 of the RPC and R.A. No. 3019, and damages.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Prosecutors' Duty:** The complainant alleges that the respondents reneged on their sworn duty to uphold the law and compromised the efficient administration of justice. The complaint is premised on the prosecutor's duty to correctly assess evidence and apply relevant jurisprudence.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Jurisdiction:** The Supreme Court held that the IBP lacks jurisdiction to investigate government lawyers charged with administrative offenses involving the performance of their official duties.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315(1)(b) of the Revised Penal Code:** Estafa (the underlying criminal charge).
*   **Article 208 of the RPC:** Prosecution errors that lead to wrongful convictions or acquittals.
*   **R.A. No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (alleged violation).
*   **R.A. No. 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), Section 15, paragraph 1:** Establishes the Office of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction over public officials.
*   ***Alicias, Jr. v. Macatangay* (A.C. No. 7478, January 11, 2017):** This case is cited for the proposition that the IBP lacks jurisdiction over administrative offenses involving government lawyers' official duties.
*   **Spouses Buffe v. Secretary Gonzales:** Further supports the lack of IBP jurisdiction in cases where government lawyers are charged with administrative offenses involving their official duties.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of what constitutes an "administrative offense involving the performance of official duties" remains a potential area of contention.
*   The complainant's allegations of corruption and anomalous circumstances are vague and lack specific evidence.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the *Trovela* decision and the precedent in *Alicias, Jr. v. Macatangay*, the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction of the IBP. The proper venue for administrative action against the respondents, in their capacity as government officials, is the Department of Justice (for prosecutors), the President (for the Secretary of Justice), or the Office of the Ombudsman. The key takeaway is the clear distinction between a lawyer's accountability as a member of the Bar and their accountability as a government official.
