**Legal Document Summary: *Llamas v. Court of Appeals***

**Case:** *Francisco R. Llamas and Carmelita C. Llamas v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 149588, September 29, 2009.*

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision denying a Petition for Annulment of Judgment and Certiorari.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** Petitioners Francisco and Carmelita Llamas sought to annul the RTC decision convicting them of "other form of swindling" under Article 316(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), arguing the RTC lacked jurisdiction. They contended that the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) should have had jurisdiction given the penalty.

*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, holding that:
    *   Annulment of judgment under Rule 47 of the Rules of Court is unavailable in criminal cases. *People v. Bitanga, G.R. No. 159222, June 26, 2007* was cited as precedent.
    *   The RTC *did* have jurisdiction at the time the information was filed.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 316(2), Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines and penalizes the crime of disposing of encumbered real property without disclosing the encumbrance.
*   **Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 (BP 129):** The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended by Republic Act No. 7691, determines the jurisdiction of courts. Sec. 20 defines RTC jurisdiction, and Sec. 32 defines MTC Jurisdiction.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 47, Section 1:** Governs the annulment of judgments by the Court of Appeals in civil cases only.
*   **Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 124, Section 18** Application of certain rules in Civil Procedure to Criminal Cases.

**Jurisdictional Analysis:**

*   The Court emphasized that jurisdiction is determined at the time of the filing of the information. At that time, BP 129 (prior to its amendment by RA 7691) was in effect.
*   The information alleged a violation of Art. 316(2) RPC, with a fine of P12,895.00.  Under BP 129 at the time, the MTC's jurisdiction was limited to cases with fines not exceeding P4,000.00.
*   Therefore, the RTC correctly exercised jurisdiction.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners remain convicted of "other form of swindling" under Article 316(2) RPC. The original sentence of two months imprisonment and a fine of P18,085.00 stands.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Petitioner Francisco R. Llamas remained at large and a warrant for his arrest was outstanding.
*   Further attempts to challenge the conviction on jurisdictional grounds are likely to be unsuccessful due to *res judicata*.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None identified. The court's reasoning is straightforward. The timing of the filing of the information and the then-existing jurisdictional limits are key.
