## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Ermino v. Golden Village Homeowners Association, Inc.* (G.R. No. 180808, August 15, 2018)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari where the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision absolving Golden Village Homeowners Association, Inc. (GVHAI) from liability for damages suffered by Spouses Ermino due to flooding. The damages were primarily attributed to the negligence of E.B. Villarosa & Partners Co., Ltd. (E.B. Villarosa), the developer of Hilltop City Subdivision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Easement of Waters (Article 637, Civil Code; Article 50, Water Code):** Lower estates (Alco Homes and Golden Village) are obliged to receive waters that naturally flow from higher estates (Hilltop City Subdivision) *without* human intervention.
*   **Obligations of Dominant Estate (Article 627, Civil Code):** The owner of the dominant estate (Hilltop City Subdivision) cannot make works which will increase the burden on the servient estates.
*   **Proprietary Rights (Article 430, Civil Code):** Landowners have the right to enclose their land, but this is limited by existing easements.

**Liabilities & Findings:**

*   **E.B. Villarosa's Liability:** Found liable for negligence. Its bulldozing and land development activities on the Hilltop City Subdivision altered the natural flow of water, increasing the burden on the lower estates and proximately causing damage to the Spouses Ermino's property. Failure to implement appropriate water control measures (retaining walls, drainage) contributed to the damage. ( *Remman Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 386 Phil. 340 (2000) applied)
*   **GVHAI's Non-Liability:** Absolved of liability. The construction of the concrete fence was a valid exercise of proprietary rights done to prevent unauthorized access, not to maliciously obstruct water flow. No negligence found because harm was not reasonably foreseeable.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The crux of the case hinged on whether the water flow was "natural" (imposing a duty on lower estates) or "artificial" (created by the developer's actions).
*   The Court highlights that the alteration of the land through bulldozing *increases the burden* on the lower estates and the flow cannot be considered a normal flow.
*   The ambiguous element lies in the definition of "natural flow" after the land has been developed. The court placed emphasis on the alteration of natural flow.
*   The potential risk lies in the possible assertion of liability if the Golden Village altered the landscape of their property in a way that contributed to the damage suffered by Spouses Ermino.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 20, 21, 430, 613, 627, 637
*   **Water Code:** Article 50
*   ***Picart v. Smith, Jr.*, 37 Phil. 809 (1918):** Test for negligence.
*   ***ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, 361 Phil. 499 (1999):** Definition of malice and bad faith.
*   ***Spouses Custodio v. Court of Appeals*, 323 Phil. 575 (1996):** Proprietary Rights.

*   ***Remman Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 386 Phil. 340 (2000):** Distinction of natural and artificial water flow.

**Conclusion:** GVHAI's defense prevailed because their actions were deemed a reasonable exercise of proprietary rights without malicious intent or negligence. The primary responsibility for the damages rested with E.B. Villarosa due to its negligent land development practices that altered the natural flow of water and overburdened the lower estates.
