## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-03-1781 & RTJ-03-1782

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Administrative Matter)

**Parties:**
*   **Complainants:** George P. Mercado (substituted by heirs) and State Prosecutor Emmanuel Y. Velasco
*   **Respondent:** Hon. Erasto D. Salcedo (deceased), Presiding Judge, RTC Tagum City, Davao del Norte, Branch 31

**Nature of Action:** Consolidated administrative cases charging Judge Salcedo with violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and Canons of Judicial Ethics, specifically dishonesty, inefficiency, gross misconduct, serious misconduct, impropriety and gross ignorance of the law.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

1.  **False Investigation Report (Judge Agayan):**
    *   **Charge:** Falsifying the investigation report regarding Judge Agayan's absenteeism and irregular attendance. Failed to adequately investigate claims of absenteeism and irregular attendance by Judge Agayan and his court staff.
    *   **Finding:** Guilty of dishonesty, inefficiency, and serious misconduct. Violated Canon 3 and Rule 3.08 of Canon 3, and Canons 3 and 31 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics.
    *   **Penalty:** Fine of P40,000.00.

2.  **Possession/Use of Stolen Vehicle:**
    *   **Charge:** Using a vehicle (Pajero) that was the subject of a dismissed anti-fencing case before his court, and borrowing it from a litigant (Leopoldo Gonzaga) with pending cases.
    *   **Finding:** Guilty of serious misconduct and impropriety. Violated Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 and Rule 2.01 of Canon 2, and Canon 3 of the Canons of Judicial Ethics. Knowledge of the vehicle's history and Gonzaga's pending cases was established.
    *   **Penalty:** Fine of P40,000.00.

3.  **Execution of Final Judgment (Agrarian Case):**
    *   **Charge:** Modifying a final and executory decision in an agrarian case to include further "adjustment" of the judgment amount.
    *   **Finding:** Guilty of gross ignorance of the law. Violated Rule 3.01, Canon 3 of the Code of Judicial Conduct. The court cited the principle of immutability of judgments, as stated in *Equitable Banking Corporation v. Sadac, G.R. No. 164772*.
    *   **Penalty:** Fine of P40,000.00.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   Judge Salcedo (through his estate) is liable to pay a total fine of P120,000.00, deductible from his retirement benefits.
*   Judge Salcedo had the obligation to perform his official duties honestly, impartially and diligently.
*   He was obligated to conduct an impartial investigation of Judge Agayan's absenteeism.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Mitigation:** The death of Judge Salcedo generally would preclude an adminstrative action. The case was continued because the decision to impose a monetary fine could still be deducted from the retirement benefits, meaning the proceedings weren't useless.
*   **Prosecutor Aquiatan Referral:** The possible administrative liability of Prosecutor Matias Aquiatan for hastily reinvestigating Leopoldo Gonzaga in Criminal Case No. 11728 is referred to the Department of Justice, creating potential for a separate investigation.
*   **Fact-Finding reliance:** The court relied heavily on factual findings of fact. A challenge of the findings of fact would have potentially changed the ultimate outcome of the case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Judicial Conduct:** Rules 1.01, 2.01, 3.01, 3.08.
*   **Canons of Judicial Ethics:** Canons 3, 31.
*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** Sections 8 and 11 regarding serious charges and penalties.
*   **Anti-Fencing Law:** P.D. No. 1612.
*   **Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972:** R.A. No. 6539.
*   ***Equitable Banking Corporation v. Sadac, G.R. No. 164772***:  Cited regarding the principle of immutability of judgments.
*   The court cited many previous supreme court decisions.

**Concerns & Contentious Issues:**

*   **Inference of Knowledge:** The finding of knowledge regarding the vehicle's history relied on inferences based on circumstances.
*   **Subjectivity:** The determination of what constitutes "serious misconduct" and "impropriety" can be subjective and fact-dependent. The judge's intent was inferred from his actions.
