**Case Summary: *Remedios Ramirez Tapucar v. Atty. Lauro L. Tapucar*, A.C. No. 4148 (1998)**

**Nature:** Disbarment proceeding initiated by Remedios Ramirez Tapucar against her husband, Atty. Lauro L. Tapucar, based on grossly immoral conduct.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Grounds for Disbarment:** Respondent engaged in continuing grossly immoral conduct by cohabiting with Elena (Helen) Pe単a and subsequently marrying her while his marriage to complainant still subsisted.
*   **Previous Administrative Sanctions:** Respondent had a history of administrative charges, including suspension and separation from service as a CFI Judge, primarily due to the same relationship with Ms. Pe単a. *Administrative Matter No. 1740 (1980)* and *Dy Teban Hardware & Auto Supply Co. v. Tapucar, 102 SCRA 493 (1981).*
*   **Second Marriage:** Respondent married Elena Pe単a on March 5, 1992, while still married to the complainant, violating Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code and potentially constituting bigamy.
*   **Abandonment:** Respondent abandoned his wife and children.
*   **IBP Recommendation:** The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Board of Governors adopted the recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner to disbar the respondent.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Obligations Violated:** Respondent violated Rule 1.01 (unlawful, dishonest, immoral conduct) and Rule 7.03 (conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice law and scandalous behavior) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. He also violated his oath as a lawyer.
*   **Liability:** Disbarment

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy Argument:** The respondent argued that prior sanctions for the relationship with Elena Pe単a constitute double jeopardy. However, the Court rejected this as the disbarment proceeding is based on new and continuing acts of immorality, specifically the second marriage. The current cause of action differs from the original charges, as the second marriage constitutes a new act of immoral conduct.
*   **Aggravating Factor:** Respondent's prior position as a judge is an aggravating factor, as it requires a higher standard of ethical conduct.
*   **Impact of Previous Withdrawal:** The Complainant's previous withdrawal of a similar case in 1976 was deemed not to bar the present action, considering that subsequent acts of misconduct prompted the refiling of the complaint to protect the children.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility, Rules 1.01 and 7.03:** Used as the primary basis for finding the respondent's conduct unethical and grounds for disbarment.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court:** The authority by which the Supreme Court is allowed to disbar based on misconduct.
*   *Obusan vs. Obusan, Jr., 128 SCRA 485, 487* and *Toledo v. Toledo, 117 Phil. 768*: Cited as precedents for disbarring lawyers for abandonment and adultery/cohabitation.
*   **Rayos-Omboc v. Atty. Rayos, Adm. Case No. 2884, January 28, 1998:** Citing the case regarding good moral character remaining intact as the lawyer continues practice.
*   **Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code:** Bigamy
*   **Rule 1.01 and 2.01 of the Code of Judicial Conduct:** Highlighted respondent's failure to uphold the high standard of conduct expected of a former member of the judiciary.

**Conclusion:**

The Court disbarred Atty. Tapucar, finding his conduct grossly immoral and violative of the Code of Professional Responsibility. His prior administrative sanctions and cavalier attitude towards the charges further contributed to the decision. The respondent's argument of double jeopardy was rejected by the Court.
