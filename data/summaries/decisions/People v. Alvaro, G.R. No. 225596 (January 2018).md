## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Alvaro & Geronimo*, G.R. No. 225596 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction for violation of Sections 5 (illegal sale) and 11 (illegal possession) of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, RA 9165 (Illegal Sale):** Prohibits the unauthorized sale, trading, distribution, or transportation of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (a) identity of buyer/seller, object, and consideration, and (b) delivery and payment.
*   **Section 11, RA 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Prohibits unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs. Requires proof of (a) possession of a dangerous drug, (b) lack of legal authorization, and (c) free and conscious possession.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 (Chain of Custody):** Establishes procedures for handling seized drugs to preserve integrity and evidentiary value. Requires immediate physical inventory and photography of seized items in the presence of the accused, a representative from the media, DOJ, and an elected public official, who must sign the inventory. Seized drugs must be turned over to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours.
*   **Saving Clause (Section 21(a) IRR, now RA 10640):** Allows for non-compliance with procedural requirements under justifiable grounds, provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. Prosecution bears the burden of proving justifiable grounds.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, accused-appellants were found liable for violating Section 5 of RA 9165, resulting in a sentence of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000 each.
*   Geronimo was also found liable for violating Section 11 of RA 9165, resulting in an imprisonment sentence of 12 years and 1 day to 15 years and a fine of P400,000.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody Breaches:** The Court found *multiple* unexplained breaches and inconsistencies in the chain of custody of the seized drugs, including:
    *   Conflicting testimonies regarding the location of the marking and inventory (place of arrest vs. EDSA).
    *   Failure to establish the presence of the accused or required witnesses (media, DOJ) during inventory.
    *   Lack of photographic evidence of the seized items.
    *   Discrepancies in the markings of the seized sachets ("JSJR" vs. "JSJRND").
    *   Unexplained involvement of a third party ("Serrano") in delivering the request for laboratory examination.
*   **Lack of Justification for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable reasons for deviations from the procedure outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165. The Court held it could not presume such grounds existed.
*   **Inadequate Stipulation:** The prosecution's stipulation regarding the forensic chemist's testimony failed to adequately address the discrepancy in sachet markings and the whereabouts of evidence during crucial transfer points.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5 & 11:** Defines the offenses of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, respectively.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21:** Sets forth the chain of custody requirements.
*   **RA 10640 (Amendment to RA 9165, Section 21):** Codifies the "saving clause" for non-compliance with procedural requirements under justifiable grounds.
*   **Relevant Case Law:**
    *   *People v. Dahil*, G.R. No. 212196, January 12, 2015 - Stresses the importance of appellate review in criminal cases.
    *   *People v. Sumili*, G.R. No. 212160, February 4, 2015 - Reinforces the elements of illegal sale.
    *   *People v. Bio*, G.R. No. 195850, February 16, 2015 - Reinforces the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs.
    *   *People v. Viterbo*, G.R. No. 203434, July 23, 2014 - Underscores the need to establish the identity of confiscated drugs beyond reasonable doubt.
    *   *People v. Almorfe*, 631 Phil. 51, 60 (2010) - Stresses the need for the prosecution to show the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.
    *   *People v. De Guzman*, 630 Phil. 637, 649 (2010) - Emphasizes that justifiable ground for non-compliance must be proven as a fact.
    *   *People v. Sorin*, G.R. No. 212635, March 25, 2015 - Provides that reasonable doubt regarding the identity of the drugs leads to acquittal.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and *acquitted* accused-appellants due to the numerous unexplained breaches in the chain of custody and the failure of the prosecution to adequately justify deviations from established procedures. The Court concluded that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were compromised, creating reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. This case underscores the critical importance of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule in drug-related cases, particularly the requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, and the stringent burden on the prosecution to justify any deviations from those procedures.
