Okay, here is a legal summary of *Polotan v. Court of Appeals*, 357 Phil. 250 (1998), formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Rodelo G. Polotan, Sr. v. Court of Appeals, Regional Trial Court in Makati City, and Security Diners International Corporation* (G.R. No. 119379, September 25, 1998)

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Rodelo Polotan, Sr. (Cardholder) applied for and was issued a Diners Club credit card by respondent Security Diners International Corporation (Diners Club).
*   The application contained terms including interest charges on unpaid balances at "3% per annum plus the prime rate of Security Bank & Trust Company."  The contract allowed Diners Club to adjust the interest rate based on "prevailing market rates."
*   Polotan incurred charges of P33,819.84 which he failed to pay.  Diners Club sued for collection.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of Diners Club, ordering Polotan to pay the principal, interest (3% + prime rate + 2% monthly service charge), and attorney's fees (25%). Ofricano Canlas was held jointly and severally liable and Polotan was ordered to indemnify him for any amount he may be required to pay the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Interest Rate Clause:**  The central issue is the validity of the interest rate provision in the Diners Club application.  Polotan argued it was ambiguous, illegal, and violated Central Bank circulars because it allowed for escalation but not de-escalation. He claims there was no meeting of minds.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** Polotan argued the Diners Club application was a contract of adhesion and ambiguities should be construed against Diners Club.
*   **Statement of Account:** Polotan attempted to use a Diners Club statement of account (Exh. "2") for his wife, Mrs. Polotan (supplementary cardholder) with a zero balance to argue that her account was paid.
*   **Damages:** Polotan counterclaimed for damages based on Diners Club's alleged bad faith.

**Court's Ruling & Rationale:**

*   **Factual Findings Affirmed:** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual findings of the lower courts that Polotan owed Diners Club the amount claimed. General Rule- factual findings of the trial court, adopted and confirmed by the Court of Appeals, are final and conclusive and may not be reviewed on appeal
*   **Contract of Adhesion Valid:** While acknowledging the contract was one of adhesion and the terms were technical and could be beyond the understanding of an ordinary layman, the Court emphasized that such contracts are binding because the adhering party is free to reject them entirely. It cited *Phil. Commercial International Bank vs. CA* 255 SCRA 299 [1996]
*   **Interest Rate Clause Upheld:** The Court found no inherent problem with escalation clauses *per se* (citing *People v. Dizon*, 260 SCRA 851 (1996)), so long as they are not solely potestative (dependent solely on the will of one party) and are based on reasonable grounds.  The Court found the escalation dependent on prevailing market rates, outside Diners Club's control.  Referencing *Florendo v. CA*, 265 SCRA 678 (1996), the Court noted that unilaterally imposed increases would violate the mutuality of contracts per Article 1308 of the Civil Code.
*   **No Judicial Admission/Contradiction:** The Court rejected Polotan's argument that Diners Club judicially admitted payment by Mrs. Polotan.  The court upheld Diners Clubs explanation through testimonial evidence.
*   **No Damages Awarded:** The Court found no basis to award damages to Polotan.

**Key Statutory/Case Law References:**

*   **Article 1308, Civil Code:**  Mutuality of contracts.
*   **Central Bank Circular 905:**  Discussed in relation to legality of interest rates and escalation clauses.
*   **Rule 129, Section 2, Revised Rules on Evidence** Relates to Admissions by adverse party
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence, Section 4 of Rule 129 of the Revised Rules on Evidence** - Palpable Mistake
*   ***Phil. Commercial International Bank vs. CA*** *255 SCRA 299 [1996]*
*   ***People v. Dizon*** *260 SCRA 851 (1996).*
*   ***Florendo v. CA*** *265 SCRA 678 (1996)*

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **"Prime Rate" and "Prevailing Market Rate" Definition:**  The decision acknowledges these terms are technical.  Future litigation could arise if "prevailing market rate" is not clearly defined in the contract or consistently applied. The Court did not provide further definition on these terms.
*   **Application of *Florendo v. CA*:** While the Court distinguished the facts from *Florendo*, future cases may challenge escalation clauses by arguing unilateral imposition by the creditor.

**Outcome:**

*   The Petition for Certiorari was denied.
*   The Court of Appeals decision was affirmed with a MODIFICATION reducing attorney's fees to 15%.
