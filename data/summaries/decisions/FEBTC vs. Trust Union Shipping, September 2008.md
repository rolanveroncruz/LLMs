**Case:** G.R. No. 154716

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** September 16, 2008

**Nature of Document:** Resolution approving a Compromise Agreement.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners (Originally):** Far East Bank and Trust Co. (FEBTC), Trust and Investment Group, and FEB Investment, Inc. (FEBI).  Now substituted by Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc. (PI One).
*   **Respondents:** Trust Union Shipping Corp. (TUSC), Sweet Lines, Inc., and the vessel M/V "Sweet Glory" (Ex M/V "Sweet Roro 2").
*   **Intervenor:** Philippine Ports Authority (PPA).

**Background:**

*   This case originated from a credit facility extended by FEBTC and FEBI to Sweet Lines, secured by a ship mortgage over M/V Sweet Glory executed by TUSC. Sweet Lines defaulted, leading to a judicial foreclosure case filed by FEBTC.
*   The RTC ruled in favor of FEBTC, ordering Sweet Lines to pay the outstanding loan amount. The CA reversed the RTC decision.
*   The CA nullified the foreclosure of the mortgage constituted over M/V Sweet Glory and the vessel arrest. It ordered FEBTC to pay TUSC Php45 million as reparation for the loss of M/V Sweet Glory, plus 10% attorney's fees. The CA ordered Sweet Lines to pay Far East Bank and Trust Company the principal sum of P30,000,000.00, plus interests and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions of the Compromise Agreement:**

*   **Mutual Release:**  PI One (as successor to FEBTC/FEBI) and TUSC mutually release each other from all claims, counterclaims, and causes of action arising from the foreclosure of M/V Sweet Glory. Cites Art. 2028 of the Civil Code.
*   **Substitution of Party:** PI One is substituted as petitioner in place of FEBTC/FEBI.
*   **Escrow Account Distribution:** Proceeds of the Escrow Account (Banco de Oro Account No. 102-78313-1), holding proceeds from the sale of M/V Sweet Glory, including interest earned, are to be divided equally (50/50) between PI One and TUSC, net of certain fees. Conversion and transfer of TUSC's share to U.S. Dollars is mandated.
*   **Escrow Account Renewal:** Terms of the Escrow Account are to be renewed until approval of the Compromise Agreement by the Supreme Court.
*   **Dismissal of Appeal:** Upon receipt of the escrow proceeds, PI One and TUSC are to jointly dismiss the case with prejudice.
*   **No Admission of Liability:** The Compromise Agreement is not an admission of liability by either party.
*   **Confidentiality Clause:**  Parties agree to keep the terms of the Compromise Agreement confidential.
*   **Full Satisfaction:** This Agreement constitutes full and complete satisfaction of claims, counterclaims, and causes of action between the parties.

**Legal Considerations:**

*   **Validity of Compromise:** The Court affirms the validity of the Compromise Agreement, citing Art. 1306 of the Civil Code, emphasizing that parties can establish stipulations as they deem convenient provided they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.
*   **Encouragement of Settlement:** The Court emphasizes the encouragement of dispute settlement as a desirable practice, citing *Philippine National Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC) v. Abella* and *Viesca v. Gilinsky*.
*   **Succession of Rights:** The resolution recognizes the assignment of FEBTC/FEBI's rights, title, interest, and causes of action to PAII and subsequently to PI One, implicitly acknowledging the valid succession of rights.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The Compromise Agreement focuses primarily on settling claims between PI One and TUSC. The potential impact on or rights of Sweet Lines, Inc. given it is not a party to this agreement, needs careful consideration.
*   The confidentiality clause (2.6) may pose challenges in future enforcement or discovery proceedings.
*   It is not clear if PI One has the right to further collect on Sweet Lines, Inc. pursuant to the Decision rendered by the CA on March 13, 2002.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court approved the Compromise Agreement, effectively terminating the case. The agreement primarily addresses the distribution of funds from the sale of the M/V Sweet Glory between the successor to the bank's rights and the shipping corporation that held the ship mortgage.  It is crucial to verify the current status of Sweet Lines, Inc. and the enforceability of the CA decision.
