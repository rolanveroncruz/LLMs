**Case Summary: *Firaza v. People*, G.R. No. 179319 (2009)**

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Eugene Firaza, an NBI confidential agent, for unauthorized carrying of a licensed firearm outside his residence, a violation of Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866, as amended by R.A. No. 8294. Firaza was apprehended with an expired permit to carry a firearm outside his residence.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Accusation:** Firaza was charged with unlawfully possessing a .45 caliber pistol with an expired permit to carry outside his residence.
*   **Defense:** Firaza argued he had a Mission Order from the NBI authorizing him to carry the firearm and that the charge should have been for illegal possession, not unauthorized carrying. He also claimed illegal search.
*   **MCTC Ruling:** Guilty of unauthorized carrying of a licensed firearm outside residence.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Affirmed MCTC's conviction.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed RTC's decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Denied Firaza's petition, upholding the CA's decision.

**Obligations:**

*   Possession of a valid permit to carry a firearm outside residence.
*   For NBI confidential agents, compliance with P.D. No. 1866, as amended, regarding firearm permits and licenses.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability under Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866, as amended by R.A. No. 8294, for carrying a licensed firearm outside residence without legal authority.
*   Imprisonment of one (1) month and ten days of *arresto mayor*

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses/Ambiguities:**

*   **Ambiguity in Complaint:** Firaza argued the complaint charged "illegal possession," not "unauthorized carrying."  The court rejected this, finding the complaint sufficiently described the offense of unauthorized carrying.
*   **Mission Order vs. Permit to Carry:** The court clarified that a Mission Order is *not* equivalent to a permit to carry. Moreover, the specific Mission Order was limited in scope and did not cover Firaza's private business activity when he was apprehended.
*   **Status as Confidential Agent:**  The court relied on *Sayco v. People* to emphasize that special or confidential civilian agents not on the regular plantilla are *not* exempt from needing a license to possess and a permit to carry.
*   **Search and Seizure:**  Firaza argued the firearm was seized during an illegal search. The court invoked the plain view doctrine, justifying the police intervention due to the "heated arguments" and the suspicious bulge on Firaza's waist. The court found that exigent circumstances existed that justified the search of the accused.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1866, as amended by R.A. No. 8294, Section 1:** Defines the offense of unlawful manufacture, sale, acquisition, disposition, or possession of firearms or ammunition.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 110, Sections 6 & 9:** Defines the sufficiency of a complaint or information.
*   ***Sayco v. People*, G.R. No. 159703 (2008):** Clarifies the applicability of P.D. No. 1866 to special/confidential civilian agents.

*   **People v. Go, G.R. No. 144639 (2003):** Discusses the plain view doctrine.

**Legal Precision:**

*   The court distinguished between "illegal possession" and "unauthorized carrying of a licensed firearm outside residence," the latter being the specific offense Firaza was convicted of.
*   The court emphasized the requirement of both a license to possess and a permit to carry for non-regular plantilla confidential agents.
* The court made it clear that a Mission Order is not equivalent to a permit to carry.
