**Legal Document Summary: *Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Villanueva Manalo II vs. People of the Philippines***

**Case:** G.R. No. 265585, April 15, 2024 (Supreme Court of the Philippines)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmance of the RTC's denial of a Motion to Quash the Amended Information.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Amended Information should be quashed on the ground of double jeopardy.

**Facts:**

*   Police executed a search warrant at Manalo's house, allegedly finding unlicensed firearms and ammunition.
*   Original Information filed charging Manalo with illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under RA 10591, Section 28(b).
*   Prosecution moved to amend the Information to include the fact that a shotgun was loaded with ammunition, potentially upgrading the charge to RA 10591, Section 28(e) (qualified offense).
*   Original information was read to manalo and he entered plea of not guilty. Prosecution realized their mistake and read the amended information. Manalo refused to plead, so the court entered a plea of not guilty.
*   Manalo filed a Motion to Quash the Amended Information, arguing double jeopardy.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court denied the petition, affirming the CA and RTC rulings.
*   The Court held that double jeopardy did not attach because a valid plea to the Amended Information, the correct and controlling document, had not been validly terminated by a conviction, aquittal, or dismissal.
*   Court reasoned that the error in reading the original information, superseded by the Amended Information, should not penalize the prosecution.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **RA 10591, Section 28(b) and (e):**  Defines unlawful acquisition and possession of firearms and ammunition, and sets forth the penalties for same. Amended Information sought to charge a more serious offense by including the detail of the ammunitions.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 117, Sections 3(i) and 7:**  Outline the grounds for a Motion to Quash, including double jeopardy, and the requisites for double jeopardy to apply.

**Liabilities:**

*   Manalo faces potential conviction under the Amended Information, which may carry a harsher penalty.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** The core legal debate centers on whether the initial arraignment on the *original* Information, even though erroneous, triggered double jeopardy protections. Justice Leonen's dissent argues in favor of double jeopardy, highlighting the fact that the original information was read to Manalo and he entered a plea of not guilty.
*   **Validity of the "Not Guilty" Plea:** The validity of the "not guilty" plea entered by the court on Manalo's behalf for the Amended Information is questionable, given his explicit refusal to enter a plea at that stage.
*   **Prosecutorial Inadvertence:** The prosecution's initial failure to properly charge the offense.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Cabangangan v. Concepcion (95 Phil. 87)*** and ***Binabay v. People of the Phil. (147 Phil. 402)*** Discusses the superseding effect of an Amended Information over a original information.
*   ***People v. Cawaling (355 Phil. 1)*** Defines the requirements for double jeopardy to attach.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 10591 (Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 117.

**Note:** The key argument revolves around the interpretation and application of the elements necessary for double jeopardy to attach. The court emphasized that all of the elements must be present in order for double jeopardy to apply, and the supreme court stated that because the Amended Information was the only valid document, a plea to the original information did not trigger double jeopardy.
