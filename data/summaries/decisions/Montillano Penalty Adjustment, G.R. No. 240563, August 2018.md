**Legal Document Summary: *In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty Pursuant to Republic Act No. 10951, in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan – Emalyn Montillano y Basig***

**Case:** G.R. No. 240563, August 14, 2018 (838 Phil. 636)

**Nature:** Petition for Release seeking modification of penalty and immediate release pursuant to RA 10951 and *Hernan v. Sandiganbayan*.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **RA 10951 Impact:** This case involves the retroactive application of RA 10951, which adjusted penalties for theft based on the value of the stolen property. Specifically, Section 81, paragraph 4, applies, reducing the penalty for theft where the value exceeds P5,000 but does not exceed P20,000.
*   **Original Sentence:** The Petitioner was originally convicted of Simple Theft (P6,000) and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 6 months of *arresto mayor* to 4 years of *prision correccional*.
*   **Ruling:** While recognizing RA 10951's applicability, the Supreme Court (SC) *granted* the petition only to the extent of remanding the case to the RTC for re-determination of the penalty. The court relies on *In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty pursuant to R.A. No. 10951 in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan – Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil* to establish procedural guidelines.
*   **RTC Obligations (Remand):** The RTC must determine:
    *   The proper penalty under RA 10951.
    *   Whether the petitioner is entitled to immediate release based on the modified sentence and time served (including good conduct time allowance).
* **Applicability of Regular Rules:** The Rules of Court shall apply to the special cases in a suppletory capacity insofar as they are not inconsistent therewith.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Ambiguity in "Immediate Release":** The final determination of immediate release hinges on the RTC's assessment of time served and good conduct time allowance. The court may find that even under the reduced penalty, the petitioner hasn't served sufficient time or doesn't qualify for release.
*   **Procedural Hurdles:** The SC outlined specific procedural guidelines (derived from the *Elbanbuena* case) that must be followed, potentially creating administrative burdens and delays. These guidelines heavily regulate allowed pleadings, timeframes, and appeal options.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 10951:** The core statute driving the action.
*   ***Hernan v. Sandiganbayan*** **(G.R. No. 217874, December 5, 2017):**  Cited for the principle of reopening terminated cases to modify penalties under RA 10951. This provides the justification for the relief requested.
*   ***In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty pursuant to R.A. No. 10951 in Relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan – Rolando Elbanbuena y Marfil*** **(G.R. No. 237721, July 31, 2018):** Established the procedural guidelines.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applies in determining the correct penalty range.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The reliance on RTC for determining "actual length of time served" and "good conduct time allowance" is crucial. These are factual determinations that are potentially subject to dispute and could be impacted by issues with record-keeping.

**Next Steps for Lawyer:**

1.  File the petition with the appropriate RTC (Muntinlupa City, Branch 204).
2.  Ensure the petition includes all required documentation: certified copy of the original Decision, mittimus (if available), and a certification from the Bureau of Corrections regarding time served.
3.  Monitor the OSG's response and be prepared to argue for immediate release, if warranted, based on the modified penalty under RA 10951 and time already served.
4. Prepare to make arguments concerning the Good Conduct Time Allowance.
