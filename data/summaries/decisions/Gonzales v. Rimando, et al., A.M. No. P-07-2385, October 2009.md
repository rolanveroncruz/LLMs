## Legal Document Summary: Gonzales v. Rimando et al.

**Case:** A.M. No. P-07-2385, October 26, 2009 (619 Phil. 392)

**Nature:** Administrative case against court personnel for Grave Misconduct, Usurpation of Authority, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Court/Justice.

**Parties:**

*   **Complainant:** Judge Jacinto C. Gonzales, MTCC Branch 2
*   **Respondents:** Alexander C. Rimando (Clerk of Court & City Sheriff), Annaliza O. Flores (Clerk III - deceased), Perlita D. Dumlao (Sheriff III), and Ramon R. Ramones (Utility Worker I).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Unauthorized Execution:** Rimando, bypassing the branch sheriff, executed a writ of execution in *Civil Case No. 4876, "Shirley Gonzaga v. Felicitas de la Cruz"*, and seized a vehicle belonging to a third party, Ramon Reyes, who was not a party to the case.
*   **Illegal Levy:** Rimando levied on the vehicle despite being informed it did not belong to the judgment debtor, Felicitas de la Cruz, violating Section 9, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (Execution of judgments for money, how enforced).  He failed to demand payment from the judgment debtor before seizing assets.
*   **Lis Pendens Abuse:**  Rimando filed a "Notice of Lis Pendens" with the LTO falsely claiming the vehicle was the subject of *Civil Case No. 4876*, despite the case being a simple collection suit. This misrepresented the nature of the action and improperly encumbered the third party's vehicle. This violates Section 14, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court and Section 76 of P.D. 1529 regarding the application of notice of lis pendens.
*   **Unauthorized Release Attempt:** Rimando attempted to release the vehicle on a Sunday without a court order.
*   **Insubordination:** Rimando refused to comply with Judge Gonzales' order to comment on Reyes' complaint.
*   **Repeated Disregard for OCA Orders:** Rimando failed to submit his comment as directed by the OCA, requiring a Show Cause Order from the Supreme Court.
* **Death of Flores:** the complaint against Clerk III Annaliza Flores was dismissed due to her death.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Rimando:** Found guilty of Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and two counts of Gross Insubordination. Violated his ministerial duty by failing to follow proper procedure for execution of judgments. Liable for levying on property of a third party. Disregarded lawful orders from both Judge Gonzales and the OCA.
*   **Dumlao & Ramones:** Exonerated as they were following Rimando's instructions. No evidence of bad faith.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Rimando's Defenses:** Rimando's justifications for his actions (e.g., assisting Flores' family, belief in the prejudgment of Judge Gonzales) were rejected as unconvincing.
*   **Reliance on Creditor Information:** Rimando's reliance on the judgment creditor's information without independent verification exacerbated the improper levy.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 9, Revised Rules of Court:** Outlines the proper procedure for executing judgments for money. Rimando's actions directly contravened these procedures.
*   **Rule 13, Section 14, Rules of Court and Section 76 of P.D. No. 1529:**  Regarding notice of *lis pendens*, applied only in actions affecting the title or right of possession of real property.
*   **Francisco v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 177667, September 17, 2008:**  Emphasizes that a sheriff cannot levy on property not belonging to the judgment debtor and incurs liability if doing so.
*   **Necesario v. Dinglasa, A.M. No. P-07-2294, August 7, 2007:** Defines Gross Insubordination as indifference to administrative complaints and resolutions requiring comment.
*   **Mallare v. Ferry, A.M. No. P-00-1381 and A.M. No. P-00-1382, July 31, 2001:** Emphasizes the duty of judiciary employees to show respect and obedience to superiors.
*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52 (A) (20) and Section 52 (A)(19):** Defines the penalties for Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and Gross Insubordination.

**Outcome:**

*   Alexander C. Rimando was DISMISSED from service, with forfeiture of retirement benefits and accrued leave credits and with prejudice to re-employment in any branch or instrumentality of government.
*   Charges against Perlita D. Dumlao and Ramon R. Ramones were DISMISSED.
*   Charges against Annaliza O. Flores were DISMISSED due to her death.
