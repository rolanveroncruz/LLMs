## Legal Document Summary: Aquino v. People, G.R. No. 217349

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding convictions for violations of Republic Act No. 8239 (Philippine Passport Law).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 19(b)(1) RA 8239:**  Penalizes making false statements in a passport application. (Initially charged, but dismissed for lack of jurisdiction).
*   **Section 19(c)(1) RA 8239:** Penalizes falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering any passport or travel document or any supporting document for a passport application, with the intent of using the same.
*   **Section 19(c)(2) RA 8239:** Penalizes willfully or knowingly using or attempting to use any such false, forged, counterfeited, mutilated, or altered passport or travel document.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The Petitioner, Maria Fe Cruz Aquino, was convicted of four (4) counts of violating Section 19(c)(1) of RA 8239 for forging documents related to passport applications and using those documents to apply for US Visas.
*   She is obligated to pay a fine of P60,000.00 for each count and is sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six (6) years to a maximum of eight (8) years.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Jurisdictional Issues:**  The Court of Appeals initially dismissed some charges due to improper venue (filing in Manila when the application was made in Pasay City). While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the Manila RTC's jurisdiction, the initial dismissal highlights the importance of proper venue in criminal cases.
*   **Variance Doctrine:** The Court of Appeals initially convicted under section 19(c)(2) and the RTC under section 19(c)(1). The Supreme Court applied the variance doctrine, referencing _Socrates v. Sandiganbayan_, stating that the description of the offense in the Information is controlling, not the technical name or citation. Although a conviction can be sustained even with a misnomer in the charging document, challenges can arise if the elements of the offense charged are not sufficiently alleged in the information.
*   **Hearsay Evidence/Best Evidence Rule:** The petitioner argued that the certifications from the National Statistics Office (NSO) and Land Transportation Office (LTO) were hearsay and violated the best evidence rule and rules on authentication. The SC dismissed these contentions based on existing records.
*   **Consecutive Sentencing:** The decision specified that the penalties shall be served successively.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 8239 (Philippine Passport Law):**  The central statute at issue.
*   **Socrates v. Sandiganbayan, 324 Phil. 151 (1996):**  Cited regarding the variance doctrine and the importance of the factual allegations in the Information.
*   **Parulan v. Director of Prisons, 130 Phil. 641 (1968):** Cited in relation to criminal acts being committed within the city where the accused was found.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied by the Supreme Court to modify the penalty imposed by the lower courts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Designation of Offense vs. Description of Crime:** The Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court had differing views on the applicable provision of RA 8239. The disagreement highlights the importance of precise pleading and statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court's reliance on the variance doctrine suggests flexibility, but also potential uncertainty.
*  The initial misapplication by the lower courts as to jurisdiction and the particular sections violated signifies the complexity of the law and it's application to the circumstances.

**Counsel's Notarization Issue:**  The Supreme Court noted that the counsel notarized pleadings in violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, potentially exposing the counsel to administrative liability.
