**Case Summary: *Sps. Gabriel Llanes and Maria Llanes v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 177947 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' dismissal of the Spouses Llanes' Application for Registration of Title.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Subject Property:** Lot No. 5812, Malvar Cadastre, San Juan, Malvar, Batangas (4,014 sq. meters).
*   **Application for Registration:** Filed by Spouses Llanes under Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 14(1).
*   **Possession History:**
    *   Eugenia Valencia (grandmother): Possession since 1930s; tax declarations.
    *   Francisco Llanes (father): Cultivated the land.
    *   Servillano Llanes (brother): Purchased from Eugenia in 1965, cultivated, tax declarations.
    *   Spouses Llanes: Purchased from Servillano in 1995, cultivated, paid taxes.
*   **Alienability and Disposability:** Conflicting certifications.
    *   Original CENRO certification: December 22, 1997 (contentious).
    *   DENR and Corrected CENRO certification: March 26, 1928 (crucial for petitioners).

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the MCTC's grant of the application based on the incorrect CENRO certification stating the land became alienable and disposable only in 1997.

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) and reinstated the MCTC's decision.
*   The SC held that the Spouses Llanes met the requirements of Section 14(1) of PD 1529: alienable and disposable land possessed under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.

**Key Arguments and Legal Reasoning:**

*   **PD 1529, Section 14(1):** Establishes the requirements for land registration: (1) alienable and disposable land; (2) open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession; (3) bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.
*   **Proof of Alienability:** Positive act of government is required. A certification from CENRO of the DENR stating that the land subject of an application is found to be within the alienable and disposable site per a land classification project map is sufficient evidence to show the real character of the land subject of the application.
*   **Conflicting Certifications:** SC gave weight to corrected CENRO certification and DENR certification showing alienability since March 26, 1928.
*   **Substantial Justice:** SC invoked the principle of substantial justice to consider the corrected CENRO certification, despite it not being formally offered during the trial. This aligns with the principle that procedural rules should not frustrate the attainment of justice. *Thermphil, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*, 421 Phil. 589 (2001).
*   **Possession:**  SC found sufficient evidence of possession by the Spouses Llanes and their predecessors-in-interest before June 12, 1945, based on Servillano's testimony and tax declarations.
*   **Tax Declarations:** While not conclusive evidence of ownership, they constitute proof of a claim of title.  *Republic v. Alconaba*, G.R. No. 155012 (2004); *Consolidated Rural Bank v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 132161 (2005); *Heirs of Flores Restar v. Heirs of Dolores R. Cichon*, G.R. No. 161720 (2005).
*   **Republic's Failure to Rebut:** The Republic presented no evidence to refute the evidence of the Spouses Llanes.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**

*   **Reliance on Hearsay:** Testimony from Servillano Llanes was admitted, but the Republic did not challenge his credibility through cross-examination. The information given can be used to prove the open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession of the subject property.
*   **Procedural Flexibility:** The SC's decision highlights the potential for procedural rules to be relaxed in the interest of justice. However, this flexibility can be unpredictable and may be challenged.
*   **Chain of Title:** The case clarifies the admissibility of tax declarations as evidence of ownership, however, this does not mean they are conclusive. These tax declarations are only considered good indicia of possession in the concept of an owner.
