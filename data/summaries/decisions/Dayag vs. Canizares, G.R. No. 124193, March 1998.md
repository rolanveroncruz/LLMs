**Legal Document Summary: *William Dayag, et al. v. Hon. Potenciano S. Canizares, Jr., et al.*, G.R. No. 124193, March 6, 1998 (350 Phil. 629)**

**Nature:** Petition for certiorari assailing the NLRC resolution directing the transfer of an illegal dismissal case.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of venue in illegal dismissal cases before the NLRC.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (employees) filed a complaint for illegal dismissal, non-payment of wages, and damages against respondent Young's Construction with the NLRC-NCR.
*   Respondent moved to transfer the case to the Regional Arbitration Branch of Region VII (Cebu), arguing that the workplace was in Cebu City.
*   Labor Arbiter granted the motion. The NLRC initially dismissed the appeal but later reversed, then reversed again, ultimately ordering the transfer to Cebu.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Venue (Sec. 1(a), Rule IV, NLRC Rules of Procedure):** Originally, the case should be filed where the "workplace" of the complainant is located. The court initially focused on the location of the construction site in Cebu where the work was performed.
*   **Suppletory Application of Rules of Court:** The petitioners invoked Sections 4 & 5 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court regarding notice of hearing for motions, arguing that the motion to transfer venue was defective. The Court ruled that technical rules of procedure are relaxed in labor cases (Art. 221, Labor Code) to achieve substantial justice.
*   **Waiver of Venue:** Petitioners claimed the respondent waived the right to contest venue by filing a position paper. The Court rejected this, citing Sec. 1(c) of Rule IV which states that the objection must be raised before or at the time of the filing of the position papers. Since the motion to transfer was filed simultaneously, there was no waiver.
*   **Nestlé and Cruzvale Cases:** The Court distinguished *Nestlé Philippines, Inc. vs. NLRC* (209 SCRA 834 (1992)) and *Cruzvale, Inc. vs. Laguesma* (238 SCRA 389 (1994)) as inapplicable. *Nestlé* applies to cases involving labor unions or single acts affecting employees in different branches, while *Cruzvale* concerned a certification election issue.
*   ***Sulpicio Lines, Inc. vs. NLRC* (254 SCRA 506 (1996)) (Overruling Effect):** The Court applied the doctrine in *Sulpicio Lines*, which held that venue is permissive and should prioritize the convenience of the economically disadvantaged party (the employee). It emphasizes the Constitutional protection to labor. The Court held that requiring the Manila residents to litigate in Cebu would be oppressive, and because the employer had a Manila address for correspondence purposes it was not as oppressive.
*   **Final Ruling:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the NLRC's resolution transferring the case to Cebu and reinstated the order remanding the case to the Arbitration Branch of Origin (NCR).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Respondent Young's Construction is obligated to defend the case in the NCR.
*   The NLRC is obligated to proceed with the case in the NCR.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Definition of "Workplace":** While the *Sulpicio Lines* case favors the employee, the definition of "workplace" in the NLRC Rules could still be a point of contention if future cases present different factual scenarios.
*   **"Convenience" Standard:** The "convenience" standard is somewhat subjective and can be interpreted differently by different tribunals.
*   **Future Venue Disputes:** The permissive nature of the venue rule can lead to more venue disputes in labor cases, potentially causing delays and increased litigation costs.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 221, Labor Code:** Relaxation of technical rules of procedure.
*   **Sec. 1(a), Rule IV, NLRC Rules of Procedure:** Venue in NLRC cases.
*   **Sections 4 & 5 of Rule 15, Revised Rules of Court:** Notice of hearing for motions (applied suppletorily but relaxed).
*   ***Nestlé Philippines, Inc. vs. NLRC* (209 SCRA 834 (1992)).**
*   ***Cruzvale, Inc. vs. Laguesma* (238 SCRA 389 (1994)).**
*   ***Sulpicio Lines, Inc. vs. NLRC* (254 SCRA 506 (1996)).**  This case is the most critical, as it fundamentally shifted the interpretation of venue in labor cases.
