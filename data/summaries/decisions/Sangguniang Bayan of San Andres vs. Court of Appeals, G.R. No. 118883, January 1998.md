**Legal Document Summary: Sangguniang Bayan of San Andres v. Court of Appeals and Antonio, G.R. No. 118883**

**Case Summary:** This case revolves around the attempt by Augusto Antonio to reassume his position as an ex-officio member of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Andres, Catanduanes after a temporary designation to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was declared void by the Supreme Court. The Sangguniang Bayan refused his re-assumption.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Resignation:** Antonio resigned from the Sangguniang Bayan when designated to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. The court addresses whether this resignation was complete and operative, considering the requirements of intention to relinquish, act of relinquishment, and acceptance by the proper authority.
*   **Abandonment of Office:** The court examines whether Antonio abandoned his position, which would supersede any issues related to the resignation's validity. Abandonment is analyzed through the lens of voluntary relinquishment and nonuser.
*   **Salary Entitlement:** A determination of whether Antonio is entitled to uncollected salaries from the period he was prevented from reassuming his seat on the Sangguniang Bayan.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **B.P. Blg. 337 (Local Government Code of 1983):** The governing law at the time of Antonio's resignation. Section 146 addresses the composition of the Sangguniang Bayan.
*   **Sec. 6 of Rule XIX of B.P. Blg. 337's implementing rules:** Details the process for resignation of sanggunian members, requiring sanggunian action and notification to the appointing authority. The court questions its applicability.
*   **R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code of 1991):** Referenced in the CA decision, specifically Section 494 regarding the ex-officio membership of Liga presidents.
*   **Taule vs. Santos (200 SCRA 512):** Supreme Court case nullifying Antonio's designation to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
*   **Ortiz vs. COMELEC (162 SCRA 812):** Definition of resignation.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 238:** criminal liability for abandoning public office
*   **Triste vs. Leyte State College Board of Trustee, 192 SCRA 326:** Discussion of public officer designation and temporary assignment

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Sangguniang Bayan's Obligation:** To allow Antonio to reassume his position if legally entitled to do so.
*   **Potential Liability:** The Sangguniang Bayan could be liable for back salaries if Antonio was wrongfully prevented from performing his duties.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Acceptance:** The ambiguity surrounding who the "proper authority" is for accepting resignations under the old Local Government Code presents a significant point of contention. The court notes the resignation was not expressly accepted.
*   **Inconsistent Actions:** Antonio's resignation letter, followed by his acceptance and performance of duties in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, creates a question of intent that could be interpreted as abandonment.
*   **Laches:** Antonio's delay in asserting his right to reassume his position after the Supreme Court ruling could be construed as laches, barring his claim.
*   **No vested right to hold an office:** Public office is held upon the implied condition that the officer will diligently and faithfully execute the duties belonging to them.

**Court's Ruling (Outcome):**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition and **REVERSED** the Court of Appeals decision. The court found that while the resignation was not technically valid due to lack of proper acceptance, Antonio had effectively abandoned his position. As a result, he is not entitled to any back salaries.
