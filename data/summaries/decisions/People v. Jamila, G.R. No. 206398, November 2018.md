## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Jamila*, G.R. No. 206398 (2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming a RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs - Shabu).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA decision and **acquitted** the accused, Jerry Jamila y Viray.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165 (Sale of dangerous drugs).
*   **Prosecution's Case:** Buy-bust operation.  PO3 Villareal acted as poseur-buyer. Accused sold a plastic sachet containing 0.03 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Defense's Case:** Denial and frame-up. Accused claimed police officers planted the drugs.
*   **Core Issue:**  Whether the prosecution sufficiently established an unbroken chain of custody, proving beyond reasonable doubt that the substance seized from the accused was the same substance presented in court.

**Failures in Chain of Custody (Critical to SC's Decision):**

*   **Violation of Section 21, R.A. 9165:** The buy-bust team failed to comply with procedural safeguards.
    *   **Lack of Witnesses during Inventory:** The inventory was not conducted in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, and an elected public official.  This is a *mandatory* requirement.
    *   **No Justifiable Explanation for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution offered no valid justification for failing to secure the presence of the required witnesses, even though the buy-bust operation was planned and coordinated in advance. *People v. Reyes et al.* (G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018) emphasizes the need for justifiable explanation under oath.
    *   **Delayed Marking:** The marking of the seized item was not done immediately at the place of arrest, but later at the police station. This is problematic under *Candelaria v. People* (725 Phil. 268, 280 (2014)), which highlights that immediate marking is indispensable in the preservation of integrity and evidentiary value.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Establishes the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21:**  Outlines the mandatory procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs (physical inventory, photograph, required witnesses).
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9165, Section 21(a):**  Details the requirements of Section 21, including witness requirements.
*   ***People v. Reyes et al.*, G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018:**  Reinforces the requirement of a sworn affidavit providing justifiable explanations for non-compliance with Section 21.
*   ***Candelaria v. People*, 725 Phil. 268, 280 (2014):** Emphasizes the importance of immediate marking.
*   ***People v. Viterbo, et al.*, 739 Phil. 593 (2014):** Discusses the application of the chain of custody rule.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Reversal of Convictions:**  Failure to strictly comply with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and provide adequate justification can lead to acquittal on reasonable doubt.
*   **Suppression of Evidence:**  Evidence obtained in violation of the chain of custody rule can be suppressed, preventing its admission in court.
*   **Civil Actions:**  Potential for civil actions against law enforcement officers for violations of rights during the arrest and seizure.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The issue of when and where the inventory should take place after the amendment to R.A. 9165, particularly whether the absence of the required witnesses is fatal to the prosecution's case despite the "saving clause" that allows for non-compliance with certain conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The *Jamila* case emphasizes the importance of meticulous adherence to the chain of custody requirements outlined in R.A. 9165.  The prosecution's failure to secure the presence of required witnesses during the inventory and provide a justifiable explanation for the non-compliance, coupled with the delayed marking of the evidence, created a reasonable doubt regarding the identity and integrity of the seized drug, leading to the accused's acquittal. This case underscores the need for law enforcement to strictly follow procedural safeguards to avoid jeopardizing drug-related prosecutions.
