## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Celones vs. Metrobank and Atty. Dionido* (G.R. No. 215691)

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the validity of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) related to the redemption of foreclosed properties. The Spouses Celones sought to redeem properties mortgaged to Metrobank. They obtained funds from Atty. Dionido, leading to the execution of a MOA. The core issue is whether the MOA constituted a subrogation of rights to Atty. Dionido or merely a loan to the Spouses Celones, and consequently, who had the right to the Certificate of Redemption.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conditional Notice of Approval for Redemption (CNAR):** Metrobank approved Spouses Celones' offer to redeem for P55 Million, payable by December 20, 2007.
*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):**
    *   Atty. Dionido pays Metrobank P55 Million.
    *   Metrobank assigns "all rights, interests, and authorities" over the debt and foreclosed properties to Atty. Dionido, including the authority to sign the Deed of Redemption.
    *   Metrobank agrees to the "full subrogation" of its rights to Atty. Dionido and frees PPPC and Sps. Celones from the assumed obligation.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Metrobank:** Initially obligated to allow redemption by Spouses Celones based on the CNAR.  Potentially liable for exemplary damages and attorney's fees by CA decision for the MOA.
*   **Atty. Dionido:**  Obligated to issue the Certificate of Redemption if he acquired Metrobank's rights *after* a valid redemption.  Has right to seek recovery of P55 million from Spouses Celones.
*   **Spouses Celones:** Obligated to pay P55 Million to Atty. Dionido, as per the Supreme Court decision, plus legal interest from finality of judgment.
*   **PPPC:** Released from the Assumed Obligation under the MOA by Metrobank.

**Key Issues and Arguments:**

*   **Novation:** Did the MOA novate the CNAR? The Court ruled *no express novation*.  For implied novation, the CNAR and the MOA would have to be incompatible on every point.
*   **Redemption:** Were the properties validly redeemed by the Spouses Celones *before* the MOA took full effect? The Supreme Court determined that they were.
*   **Nature of the Transaction:** Spouses Celones argued loan; Metrobank and Atty. Dionido argued subrogation/assignment of credit. The Supreme Court finds elements of both but ultimately prioritizes the redemption.
*   **Assignment of Credit:** The Supreme Court notes that as an assignee of credit, Atty. Dionido cannot acquire rights greater than those held by Metrobank *at the time of the assignment* (Art. 1624, Civil Code).

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **For Atty. Dionido:** Risk that he cannot dispossess the Celones of the property since they had already redeemed it prior to the MOA.  Recourse is limited to recovering the P55 million via *solutio indebiti*.
*   **For Spouses Celones:** Must repay P55 million plus legal interest, creating a significant financial burden.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1236, Civil Code:**  Payment by a third person; Atty. Dionido has right to demand payment from Spouses Celones.
*   **Art. 1291, Civil Code:** Obligations may be modified by: (1) Changing their object or principal conditions; (2) Substituting the person of the debtor; (3) Subrogating a third person in the rights of the creditor.
*   **Art. 1292, Civil Code:** In order that an obligation may be extinguished by another which substitute the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new obligations be on every point incompatible with each other.
*   **Art. 1624, Civil Code**  An assignment of credit has been defined as the process of transferring the right of the assignor to the assignee who would then have the right to proceed against the debtor
*   **Salazar v. J.Y. Brothers Marketing Corp. (648 Phil. 314 (2010)):** Discusses the requisites of novation.
*   **Licaros v. Gatmaitan (414 Phil. 857, 866 (2001)):** Definition of assignment of credit.
*   **Arco Pulp and Paper Co., Inc., et al. v. Lim (737 Phil. 133, 137 (2014)):** Novation must be stated in clear and unequivocal terms to extinguish an obligation

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The MOA's use of the term "subrogation" and "assignment" could be interpreted differently. The court's focus on the timing of the assignment (after redemption) limits its impact. The fact of the Issuance of payment slips under the spouses Celones name, rather than Attty. Dionisio implies that is not for an assigment of credit.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court found that the Spouses Celones had redeemed the properties before the effective assignment of credit to Atty. Dionido. Atty. Dionido is thus ordered to issue the Certificate of Redemption, but the Spouses Celones must reimburse Atty. Dionido the P55 Million. The core legal principle at play is that an assignee cannot acquire greater rights than the assignor had at the time of the assignment. The remedy of Atty. Dionido is through *solutio indebiti*.
