## Legal Document Summary - *La Carlota Planters Association Inc. v. NLRC*

**Case:** *La Carlota Planters Association Inc./Rudolfo Azcona v. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division) and Felix Compacion*, G.R. No. 126689, October 27, 1998.

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, seeking to nullify the NLRC's decision reversing the Labor Arbiter's dismissal of an illegal dismissal complaint.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The NLRC found that Felix Compacion (Respondent) was illegally dismissed by La Carlota Planters Association Inc./Rudolfo Azcona (Petitioners). The SC upheld this.
*   **Just Cause:** The Court found that there was no just cause for dismissal.
    *   The accident involving damage to the company truck, even if due to negligence, does not automatically warrant dismissal. (*Sampang vs. Inclong*, 137 SCRA 56 cited, indicating dismissal would be disproportionate).
    *   Previous offenses (stealing fuel, alleged assault) were deemed insufficient basis for dismissal as they were not directly related to the proximate cause of the termination (truck accident). (*Filipro vs. Ople*, 182 SCRA 1 and *Stellar Industrial Services, Inc. vs. NLRC*, 252 SCRA 323 cited, reinforcing the relatedness requirement).
    *   The claim of drunkenness was unsubstantiated, relying on a delayed and uncorroborated affidavit.
*   **Due Process:** The NLRC found the Respondent was denied due process. The court agreed that the employer was obligated to provide several notices and opportunities to be heard, including a notice of dismissal, and that a 30-day suspension period did not allow them to then terminate the worker without providing the respondent with another chance to respond to the charges or confront his accusers.
    *   The Petitioners failed to provide the respondent with "ample opportunity to be heard" as required by law. Cites *Batangas Laguna Tayabas Bus Company v. NLRC*, 209 SCRA 430 (1992).
    *   Respondent was not able to confront witnesses against him. Cites *Manila Electric Company v. NLRC*, 183 SCRA 51 (1990).
    *   Cites *Balayan Colleges vs. NLRC*, 255 SCRA 1, that ample opportunity includes legal representation.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer:** To demonstrate just cause for dismissal as defined in Art. 282 of the Labor Code.
*   **Employer:** To provide procedural due process, including adequate notice, opportunity to be heard, and confrontation of witnesses.

**Liabilities:**

*   Employer liable for backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. NLRC decision awarded P121,914.98, including separation pay and backwages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Inadequate Documentation:** Reliance on belated and uncorroborated evidence (Rene Baylon's affidavit) to support the claim of drunkenness.
*   **Procedural Deficiencies:** Failure to strictly adhere to the procedural due process requirements for termination.
*   **Disproportionate Penalty:** Imposing dismissal for a negligent act (truck accident) without considering the severity of the offense.
