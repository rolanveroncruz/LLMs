## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Asdali* (G.R. No. 219835)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Hashim Asdali y Nasa* (G.R. No. 219835, August 29, 2018)

**Summary:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision, acquitting Hashim Asdali y Nasa of violating Sections 5 (sale) and 11 (possession) of Article II of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody, thereby failing to prove the *corpus delicti* beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Charges:** Accused was charged with illegal sale and possession of *shabu* (methamphetamine hydrochloride) under Sections 5 & 11, Art. II of R.A. 9165.
*   **Chain of Custody:** The core issue revolved around the integrity of the chain of custody of the seized drugs. The Court emphasized the stringent requirements of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) regarding inventory, photographing, and presence of witnesses during seizure and marking of evidence.
*   **Deviations from Procedure:** Significant deviations were noted:
    *   Marking of the seized sachets was done at the police station, not at or near the arrest site, and not in the presence of the accused.
    *   No inventory or photographs were taken at the site of arrest or the police station.
    *   Absence of any media representative, elected official, or DOJ representative during the initial marking.
    *   No justifiable reason provided for the aforementioned lapses.
*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The Court reiterated the prosecution's burden to demonstrate justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21 and to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items remained intact. Mere "substantial compliance" (as opposed to strict or at least documented justification for deviation), was deemed insufficient.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Sections 5 & 11, Article II:** Defines the offenses of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs, respectively.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21:** Stipulates the procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs, including inventory, photographing, and the presence of required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official).
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. 9165:** Further elaborates on the requirements of Section 21.
*   ***People v. Bulotano*, 736 Phil. 245 (2014):**  Cited to emphasize that marking immediately after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link and to highlight the importance of an unbroken chain.
*   ***People v. Dela Cruz*, 744 Phil. 816, 832 (2014):** Addresses the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty, which is not applicable when the official act is irregular on its face.
*   ***People v. Arenas*, 791 Phil. 601, 608 (2016):** Corpus delicti must be established with moral certainty.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Justifiable Grounds" for Non-Compliance:** The interpretation of "justifiable grounds" under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 remains a source of contention in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to articulate *any* such grounds was fatal in this case.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Court's decision reinforces the principle that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty does not apply when there are clear indications of procedural irregularities.
*   **Impact on Law Enforcement:** This case serves as a reminder to law enforcement of the importance of strict adherence to the procedural safeguards outlined in R.A. 9165 to ensure the admissibility of evidence and the validity of convictions.

**Liabilities:**

*   The accused is absolved of criminal liability.
*   Potential for administrative or criminal liability for the arresting officers if their actions were found to be intentional misconduct.

**Conclusion:**

The Court's decision underscores the crucial role of strict compliance with chain of custody requirements in drug cases. The prosecution's failure to adhere to these requirements, absent any justifiable explanation, resulted in the acquittal of the accused. This case provides a cautionary tale for law enforcement regarding the importance of meticulous documentation and adherence to procedural rules in drug-related arrests.
