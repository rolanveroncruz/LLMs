## Legal Document Summary: *Abosta Shipmanagement Corp. vs. Delos Reyes* (G.R. No. 215111)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision granting total and permanent disability benefits to a seafarer.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **POEA-SEC Section 20(B)(3):**  Governs seafarer's entitlement to sickness allowance and disability assessment by the company-designated physician (CDP).  Crucially includes the requirement for referral to a third doctor if the seafarer's physician disagrees with the CDP's assessment.
*   **2000 POEA-SEC Section 32-A (14):**  Hernia, under certain conditions, is considered an occupational disease and compensable. (Recent origin, accompanied by pain/discoloration, preceded by undue strain, immediate protrusion).

**Facts:**

*   Respondent, a bosun, contracted inguinal hernia while employed.
*   He was repatriated, treated (including surgery) by the CDP, and declared fit to work within 120 days.
*   Respondent then consulted with Dr. Orencia who declared him permanently unfit (Grade 1 disability).
*   Respondent filed a claim for disability benefits.

**Issue:** Was the respondent entitled to total and permanent disability benefits?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA, denying disability benefits.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Failure to comply with the 3rd doctor rule:** The Court emphasized that the respondent failed to comply with the mandatory provision in Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC requiring the referral of conflicting medical assessments to a third doctor.  This is crucial; failure to seek a third opinion defaults to reliance on the CDP's assessment, per *Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias*, 773 Phil. 428 (2015).
*   **Credibility of CDP:** The Court gave more weight to the CDP's assessment because it was based on a longitudinal medical evaluation and treatment, contrasting with the one-time assessment by Dr. Orencia based on general medical definitions and potential recurrence risks. Cited jurisprudence stating the CDP's assessment is more credible due to prolonged observation. Cites *INC Navigation Co. Philippines. Inc. v. Rosales, 744 Phil. 774, 786-789 (2014)*
*   **Definition of Disability:** The Court reiterated the definitions of total and permanent disability, noting that the respondent did not meet the criteria for either.
*   **Hernia as Occupational Disease**: The conditions set forth in Section 32-A (14) must all be present for hernia to be compensable.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:**  To provide sickness allowance until the seafarer is declared fit or a disability assessment is made.
*   **Seafarer's Obligation:** To initiate the third-doctor procedure if disagreeing with the CDP's assessment.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Medical Opinions:** The case highlights the persistent issue of conflicting medical assessments and the mandatory requirement for referral to a third doctor under the POEA-SEC. Failure to strictly adhere to this procedure can be fatal to a seafarer's claim.
*   **"Fit to Work" vs. "Employability":** The ruling underscores that being declared "fit to work" by the CDP doesn't necessarily guarantee re-employment; the focus is on the *medical* ability to perform duties, not on the employer's willingness to rehire.
*   **Causation:** The hernia must meet the 4 enumerated conditions under 32-A (14), especially proof that the hernia was "immediately preceded by undue or severe strain arising out of and in the course of employment."

**Statutory References:**

*   Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) 2000, particularly Section 20(B)(3) and Section 32-A (14).

**Case Law:**

*   *Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias*, 773 Phil. 428 (2015) (regarding the mandatory nature of the third doctor provision)
*   *INC Navigation Co. Philippines. Inc. v. Rosales, 744 Phil. 774, 786-789 (2014)* (credibility of the CDP)
*   *Tamin v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation, G.R. No. 220608, August 31, 2016, 802 SCRA 111, 125* (definition of total disability)

**Conclusion:**

This case reaffirms the importance of adhering to the procedural requirements of the POEA-SEC, particularly the mandatory third-doctor rule in cases of conflicting medical assessments.  It underscores the higher probative value generally accorded to the CDP's medical assessment, especially when based on longitudinal treatment.  The case serves as a cautionary tale for seafarers who bypass the established procedure for resolving medical disputes.
