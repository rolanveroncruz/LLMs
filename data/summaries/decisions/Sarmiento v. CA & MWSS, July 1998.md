Okay, here's a summary of the provided legal document, formatted for a lawyer:

**Case:** *Amalio L. Sarmiento v. Court of Appeals and Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)*, G.R. No. 110871, July 2, 1998 (353 Phil. 834)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking annulment of CA decision reversing RTC decision in a case for sum of money arising from a construction contract.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Sarmiento (Contractor) won a bid (Contract No. RS-4) to perform construction work for Respondent MWSS involving pumping stations and a reservoir.
*   Contract executed 12/21/1982, Notice to Proceed issued 03/15/1983.
*   MWSS provided advance payment for mobilization (P9M).
*   Contract jointly terminated due to Contractor's financial difficulties and rising inflation, pursuant to General Condition No. 62 (Force Majeure).
*   Contractor sued MWSS for sums allegedly due for various items including overruns, vehicle use, foreign currency adjustments, material costs, and a balance on prime cost items.
*   MWSS counterclaimed for unpaid balance of the mobilization fund, interest, customs charges, and liquidated damages.

**Trial Court Decision:**

*   RTC ruled in favor of the Contractor, awarding significant sums for various claims, including overruns, foreign currency adjustment, cost of exceeded quantities of imported materials, balance on prime cost items, and trade discounts, plus attorney's fees. Counterclaims were dismissed.

**Court of Appeals Decision:**

*   CA reversed the RTC decision, offsetting amounts awarded to the Contractor with MWSS's counterclaim for the unpaid balance of the mobilization fund, interest, and customs charges, plus attorney's fees.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   Supreme Court modified the CA decision.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **General Condition No. 62 (Force Majeure):** Provided basis for joint termination of the contract. Implication: Releases parties from certain liabilities, needs analysis regarding proper invocation and impact on outstanding obligations.
*   **Supplemental General Condition No. 10 (SGC-10) (Foreign Currency Adjustment):** SC held that the contractor was not entitled to compensation for losses from currency devaluation as payments were made directly by MWSS through a loan from ADB. Critical point: Petitioner never used his own pesos to purchase dollars to pay the suppliers since ADB paid for this.
*   **General Condition No. 54 (GC-54) / Supplemental General Condition No. 21 (SGC-21) (Prime Cost Items):** The Supreme Court addressed the calculation of the balance due for "prime cost items" (specifically pump units). SC disagreed with the Court of Appeals determination that it only included the CIF Manila value of the pump units and the costs of installation supervision. SGC-21 supplements rather than replaces GC-54 and as such, the actual net cost still includes trade discounts.
*   **Balance of Mobilization Fund:** Contractor admitted liability for the unpaid balance, but argued set-off.
*   **Customs Charges:** MWSS entitled to reimbursement per the agreement regarding the ADB loan.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** The Supreme Court removed the award of attorney's fees to MWSS because neither party actually prevailed, despite a contractual stipulation.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interpretation of SGC-21:** Specifically, the extent to which SGC-21 fully superseded GC-54 with respect to cost components considered in determining the final price. This is a focal point of the legal analysis.
*   **Lack of Clear Evidence of Payment for Overruns:** MWSS's evidence (vouchers and receipts) lacked specificity. This created liability for MWSS.

**Statutory References:**

*   Presidential Decree No. 1594 (Price Escalation)
*   Revised Rules of Court, Section 2 Rule 45

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The Supreme Court applied exceptions to the rule that only questions of law may be raised on appeal, citing *Bautista v. Mangaldan Rural Bank* (230 SCRA 16 (1994)) and related cases because of the conflicting factual findings between the RTC and CA.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court largely overturned the Court of Appeals decision, finding MWSS liable for overruns, trade discount and price adjustment, but upholding its right to reimbursement for the mobilization fund balance and customs charges, with no attorneys fees to either party.
