**Case Summary: *Republic of the Philippines v. Alvin C. Dimarucot and Nailyn Ta√±edo-Dimarucot*, G.R. No. 202069, March 7, 2018**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision dismissing the Republic's petition for certiorari that questioned RTC orders declaring a marriage null and void and denying the Republic's appeal. The case revolves around the declaration of nullity of marriage based on Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** Grounds for declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity. The issue is whether the respondent sufficiently proved the gravity, juridical antecedence, and incurability of the wife's alleged psychological incapacity.
*   **Rule 15, Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the Rules of Court:** Requirements for motions, including notice of hearing. The Republic failed to comply with the 3-day notice rule.
*   **Rule 137, Sections 1 and 2 of the Rules of Court:** Disqualification of judges and other judicial officers. Addresses the issue of a Clerk of Court (Atty. Amy) being the sibling of one of the parties (Alvin).
*   **Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 58-2008 (SC AC No. 58-08):** Implementation of Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court regarding disqualification of Clerks of Court.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential for reversal of nullity decree:** If the Republic successfully appeals, the declaration of nullity could be overturned, reinstating the marriage.
*   **Administrative liability of Clerk of Court:** The Court has ordered the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to investigate the Clerk of Court for potentially violating SC AC No. 58-08 by not disclosing her relationship with one of the parties.
*   **Due process concerns:** The Republic argues it was denied a full opportunity to contest the nullity decree due to procedural errors and alleged impropriety by the Clerk of Court.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Substantial Compliance vs. Strict Adherence to Rules:** The Republic argues for substantial compliance with Rule 15, while the RTC and CA initially insisted on strict adherence, deeming the Motion for Reconsideration a "mere scrap of paper." The Supreme Court ultimately favored relaxation of the rules in the interest of substantial justice.
*   **Applicability of Disqualification Rules to Clerks of Court:** The CA did not rule on the allegation of the Clerk of Court's potential violation of Rule 137, but the Supreme Court did clarify Clerk of Courts have a duty to conduct a screening of cases and report potential conflicts of interest.
*   **Uselessness of Motion for Reconsideration:** The CA initially dismissed the Republic's appeal for failing to file a Motion for Reconsideration, but the Supreme Court disagreed that the Republic's direct resort to the CA via certiorari was warranted under the circumstances, as it was led to believe that seeking reconsideration of the September 2010 RTC Order would have been a useless exercise.

**Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the Petition, reversed the CA's decision, and directed the RTC to give due course to the Republic's Notice of Appeal. The Court held that the RTC should have relaxed the rules of procedure to allow the Republic to fully ventilate its objections, and that the Clerk of Court's alleged violation of SC AC No. 58-08 should be investigated by the OCA.
