**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Belo*, G.R. No. 109148, December 4, 1998 (360 Phil. 36)**

**Case Summary:**
The Supreme Court affirmed the RTC decision convicting Ernesto Belo of Robbery with Rape under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua*. The Court also ordered him to return P5,060.00 to the victim and to pay her P50,000.00 as indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Robbery with Rape (Art. 294, RPC). The Court cited *People v. Mendoza*, G.R. No. 123186, stating that the timing of the rape relative to the robbery is immaterial.
*   **Penalty:** *Reclusion perpetua* (the crime happened before RA 7659's effectivity so the crime is not subject to the death penalty)
*   **Damages:** P50,000 indemnity and P50,000 moral damages awarded to the victim.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused (Ernesto Belo) is obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused is obligated to return P5,060.00 to the victim.
*   Accused is obligated to pay P50,000.00 indemnity to the victim.
*   Accused is obligated to pay P50,000.00 moral damages to the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Robbery with Rape under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Appeal:** The accused appealed based on the argument of mistaken identity and alibi. The Supreme Court found these arguments unconvincing.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** The Supreme Court considered dwelling as an aggravating circumstance but did not find it necessary for sentencing as the penalty for the crime with the use of deadly weapon would still be *reclusion perpetua* to death.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 294:** Defines Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons and its penalties.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2219:** Basis for awarding moral damages in cases of rape.
*   **People v. Barros, 245 SCRA 312:** Discusses composite crimes and their treatment under the law.
*   **People v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 123186:** Clarifies that the order of robbery and rape in the commission of the crime is not material.
*   **People v. Ching, 240 SCRA 267:** Establishes that illumination from a "gasera" is sufficient for identification.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nocturnity:** While the information alleged nocturnity (nocturnidad) or nighttime, the trial court did not consider it an aggravating circumstance. The Court applied the objective and subjective tests for nocturnity and found insufficient evidence to show that the offender purposely sought nighttime or that it facilitated the crime.
*   **Alibi:** The Court dismissed the alibi defense due to failure to prove physical impossibility of the accused being at the crime scene.

**Conclusion:**

This case affirms the conviction for Robbery with Rape based on the victim's and her daughter's positive identification of the accused, the corroborating medical evidence, and the weakness of the accused's alibi. It highlights the legal principle that the timing of rape in relation to robbery is irrelevant for the composite crime and emphasizes the importance of credible witness testimony in securing a conviction.
