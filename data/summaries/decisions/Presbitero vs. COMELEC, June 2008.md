**Case Summary: *Presbitero, Jr. v. COMELEC*, G.R. No. 178884 (2008)**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for certiorari and prohibition assailing a COMELEC Resolution dismissing a petition for declaration of failure of election and the holding of a special election.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   Petitioners sought a declaration of failure of election in Valladolid, Negros Occidental, based on alleged disenfranchisement of voters, replacement of the Municipal Election Officer (EO), low voter turnout, missing names on voter lists, defiance of a MCTC Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) by the Municipal Board of Canvassers (MBOC), and coercion of MBOC members.
*   The MCTC ordered the inclusion of 946 voters in the voter's list, which was not complied with.
*   The MBOC proceeded with canvassing and proclamation despite a TRO issued by the MCTC.
*   COMELEC dismissed the petition, finding that the grounds alleged did not fall under Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) as grounds for declaration of a failure of election.

**Legal Issues and Ruling:**

*   **Main Issue:** Whether the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition for declaration of failure of election.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the COMELEC decision, dismissing the petition. The Court reiterated that a failure of election can only be declared under the circumstances enumerated in Section 6 of the OEC.
*   The Court emphasized that the grounds raised by the Petitioners were not among those enumerated in the OEC. Furthermore the election was held, and winners were proclaimed. Therefore, there was no "failure to elect."
*   The Court also pointed out that the propriety of suspending the canvass of returns or the proclamation of candidates is a pre-proclamation issue within the sole jurisdiction of the COMELEC.
* The Court noted that had the petitioners been aggrieved by the allegedly illegal composition of the MBOC, the remedy was to file a pre-proclamation case.

**Relevant Statutory References:**

*   **Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC)**: Defines the grounds for declaring a failure of election.
*   **Section 20 of the OEC, as modified by Section 19 of RA 7166**: Pertains to pre-proclamation controversies and the authority of the COMELEC.
*   **Section 242 of the OEC**: Confirms exclusive jurisdiction of the COMELEC of all pre-proclamation controversies.

*   *Batabor v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 160428, July 21, 2004*
*   *COMELEC v. Judge Datu-Iman, 363 Phil. 446, 451 (1999)*

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Conflict:** The MCTC's issuance of the TRO was an overreach of its authority, as pre-proclamation issues fall under COMELEC's exclusive jurisdiction. This conflict highlights the importance of adhering to the defined scope of jurisdiction.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the COMELEC's decision, reinforcing the limited scope of circumstances under which a failure of election can be declared. The decision underscores the importance of following proper legal remedies and respecting the COMELEC's exclusive jurisdiction over pre-proclamation controversies.
