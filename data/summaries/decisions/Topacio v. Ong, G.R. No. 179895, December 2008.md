**Case Summary: *Topacio v. Ong***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 179895, December 18, 2008 (595 Phil. 491)

**Nature of Action:** Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition, effectively a Quo Warranto proceeding.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Ferdinand S. Topacio
*   **Respondents:** Associate Justice Gregory Santos Ong and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG)

**Key Issues:**

1.  Whether the OSG committed grave abuse of discretion in deferring the filing of a quo warranto petition against Justice Ong.
2.  Whether Justice Ong is qualified to hold office as Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan, given questions regarding his citizenship.
3.  Whether a collateral attack on Justice Ong's title to office is permissible.

**Summary of Facts:**

Petitioner Topacio seeks to prevent Justice Ong from exercising his duties as Sandiganbayan Associate Justice, citing concerns about Ong's citizenship (natural-born status specifically), referencing a prior Supreme Court decision (*Kilosbayan Foundation v. Ermita*, G.R. No. 177721, July 3, 2007) enjoining Ong from assuming a Supreme Court position until he establishes his natural-born citizenship.  Ong filed a petition with the RTC to correct his birth certificate. Topacio requested the OSG to initiate quo warranto proceedings against Ong, which the OSG deferred pending the RTC decision. Topacio filed this petition, claiming Ong was unqualified when appointed due to his birth certificate indicating Chinese citizenship or court records showing him as a naturalized Filipino. The RTC subsequently ruled in Ong's favor, declaring him a natural-born citizen.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *dismissed* Topacio's petition.

1.  **OSG's Discretion:** The Court held that the OSG did not commit grave abuse of discretion in deferring the quo warranto action. The Solicitor General has the discretion to manage government cases and acted reasonably in awaiting the RTC decision to avoid relitigation and potential forum shopping. *Gonzales v. Chavez*, G.R. No. 97351, February 4, 1992, supports the OSG's discretion in such matters.
2.  **Collateral Attack:** The Court ruled that the petition constitutes a collateral attack on Ong's title to office, which is impermissible.  Title to public office can only be challenged directly through quo warranto proceedings.
3.  **Petitioner's Lack of Standing:** The Court further held that even if the petition were treated as a quo warranto action, Topacio lacked standing as he failed to prove a clear right to the office of Associate Justice of the Sandiganbayan.  A private individual bringing quo warranto must demonstrate entitlement to the office. *Feliciano v. Villasin*, G.R. No. 174929, June 27, 2008, is cited as precedent.
4.  **De Facto Officer Doctrine:** The Court invoked the de facto officer doctrine, stating that Ong's acts as a Sandiganbayan Justice are valid even if his appointment is later found to be invalid. *Civil Service Commission v. Joson, Jr.*, G.R. No. 154674, May 27, 2004, discusses requirements for the de facto officer doctrine.
5.  **Citizenship Determination:** The Court declined to rule on Ong's citizenship, deeming it premature and potentially encroaching on the RTC proceedings.

**Key Provisions/Legal Principles:**

*   **Article VIII, Section 7(1) of the 1987 Constitution:** Requires natural-born citizenship for appointment to lower collegiate courts.
*   **Rule 66, Rules of Court (Quo Warranto):** Governs actions for usurpation of public office.
*   **De Facto Officer Doctrine:** Protects the validity of acts performed by individuals holding office under color of authority.
*   **Discretion of the Solicitor General:** OSG has broad discretion in managing government cases.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on RTC Decision:** The Court relies on the RTC decision regarding Ong's citizenship, the finality of which was questioned in companion cases G.R. No. 180543 and CA-G.R. SP No. 102318 (mentioned in the decision). The fate of those cases will impact the perceived finality of Topacio v Ong.
*   **De Facto Doctrine Limitations:** The decision doesn't fully explore the conditions for the interplay of the de facto doctrine. This vagueness leaves room for future litigation if Ong's RTC case decision is overturned.
*   **Standing in Quo Warranto:** The ruling reinforces the high bar for private individuals to bring quo warranto actions, which may limit citizen oversight of public official qualifications.
