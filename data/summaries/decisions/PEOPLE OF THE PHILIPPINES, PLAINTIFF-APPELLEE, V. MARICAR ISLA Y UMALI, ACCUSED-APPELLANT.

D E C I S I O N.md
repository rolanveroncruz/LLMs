**Case Summary: *People v. Isla***

**Citation:** G.R. No. 237352, October 15, 2018 (842 Phil. 108)

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a CA decision affirming the RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation:** Accused was charged with illegal sale of 0.04 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu).
*   **Core Issue:** Failure to comply with the mandatory chain of custody requirements under Section 21 of RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) and its IRR, particularly regarding the required witnesses during the inventory and photography of seized items.
*   **Witness Requirement:** Inventory and photography of the seized items was only conducted in the presence of a media representative and not in the presence of an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service OR the media.
* **Ruling:** The Supreme Court REVERSED the CA and RTC decisions, ACQUITTING the accused due to a break in the chain of custody.

**Obligations:**

*   Law enforcement officers have a strict obligation to comply with the chain of custody requirements outlined in Section 21 of RA 9165, including the presence of required witnesses (elected public official and representative from DOJ or media).
*   The prosecution bears the burden to justify any deviation from the prescribed chain of custody procedure and to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved. The prosecution must actively secure the presence of the required witnesses and cannot rely on mere statements of unavailability.

**Liabilities:**

*   Failure to strictly comply with the chain of custody requirements, absent a justifiable explanation, can lead to the acquittal of the accused due to reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the corpus delicti.
*   The State risks having a conviction overturned even if the defense raises the issue of chain of custody for the first time on appeal.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Justifiable Grounds for Non-Compliance:** The "saving clause" allows for non-compliance if justifiable grounds exist and the integrity of the evidence is preserved. However, the prosecution must affirmatively prove these justifiable grounds; they cannot be presumed.
*   **Lack of DOJ Representative:** The absence of a DOJ representative during inventory and photography, without a reasonable explanation, raises serious concerns about potential planting or tampering of evidence. This is a major deficiency in the prosecution's case.
*   **Miranda Warning Compliance/Validity:** While not directly addressed, the legality of the buy-bust operation and Miranda warnings must be considered. The accused alleges coercion, though this is given less weight given the chain of custody breakdown.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Primary statute violated.
*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II, RA 9165 (as amended by RA 10640) & its IRR:** Chain of custody requirements, including marking, inventory, photography, and required witnesses.
*   **People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018:** Emphasizes the State's duty to account for any lapses in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):** Reiterates strict compliance with chain of custody and the necessity of proving justifiable grounds for non-compliance.

**Legal Strategy Recommendations**

*   The defense attorney may effectively challenge the prosecution's argument on the chain of custody.
*   The prosecution must prepare to address any procedural lapses that may take place during the buy-bust operation.
