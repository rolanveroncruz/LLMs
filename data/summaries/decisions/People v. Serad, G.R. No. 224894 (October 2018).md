## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Serad*, G.R. No. 224894 (October 10, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 & IRR:** Outlines the procedure for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, including mandatory inventory and photography "immediately after seizure and confiscation" in the presence of the accused, a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official.

**Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant (Wacky) was convicted of selling 0.32 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in a buy-bust operation.
*   Defense argued planted evidence and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case.
*   The CA affirmed the RTC's conviction, finding the prosecution proved the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt.

**Core Issue:**  Whether the CA erred in finding Wacky guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165

**Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the CA decision, affirming Wacky's conviction.
*   The SC emphasized the importance of the Section 21 procedure in preserving the chain of custody and the integrity of the evidence, citing *People v. Mendoza* (736 Phil. 749 (2014)).
*   The SC acknowledged that the required witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official) were not *all* present at the *initial* inventory but found that the police officers made "earnest efforts" to comply, including conducting a subsequent inventory at the police station *with all three witnesses present*.
*   The SC cited *People v. Ramos* (G.R. No. 233744, February 28, 2018) permitting deviation from strict compliance with Section 21 under "justifiable grounds."
*   The SC held the integrity of the drugs was preserved by the immediate transfer of evidence to a crime laboratory and the forensic chemist retained access only.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Substantial Compliance Doctrine:** The SC's reliance on "earnest efforts" and "justifiable grounds" for partial non-compliance with Section 21 could be seen as weakening the strict requirements of RA 9165, potentially leading to abuse.
*   **Availability of witnesses:** The SC's reasoning that a buy-bust team has "enough time" to bring the witnesses at the time of arrest is not always possible or practical and is still a gray area.
*   **Weight of Evidence:** Although the SC affirmed Wacky's guilt, it could be argued that the minimal deviation in procedure was a good reason to challenge the weight given to the evidence.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** Key statute defining the crime and procedures.
*   **Section 5, Article II, RA 9165:**  Illegal sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165:** Procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   *People v. Mendoza*, 736 Phil. 749 (2014): Importance of insulating witnesses to prevent evidence planting.
*   *People v. Ramos*, G.R. No. 233744, February 28, 2018: Permits deviation from strict compliance with Section 21 under "justifiable grounds."

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The police have a statutory obligation to strictly comply with Section 21 of RA 9165, including the presence of all required witnesses during inventory and photography.
*   Failure to comply with Section 21 can lead to the inadmissibility of evidence and the acquittal of the accused.

**Conclusion:**

The SC affirmed Wacky's conviction, highlighting the importance of Section 21, RA 9165, while simultaneously acknowledging the possibility of deviations when "earnest efforts" are made to comply with the law. This may cause confusion over the level of compliance required in similar cases.
