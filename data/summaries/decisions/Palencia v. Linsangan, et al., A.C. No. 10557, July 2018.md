## Legal Document Summary: *Palencia v. Linsangan, et al.* A.C. No. 10557

**Nature:** Disciplinary action against Attys. Pedro L. Linsangan, Gerard M. Linsangan, and Glenda M. Linsangan-Binoya.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Solicitation of Legal Business ("Ambulance Chasing"):** Attys. Pedro and Gerard Linsangan found to have solicited legal business from the complainant, an injured seafarer, while he was bedridden in the hospital, through paralegals. This violates Rule 2.03 and Rule 1.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) and constitutes malpractice.
*   **Improper Handling of Client Funds (Canon 16 Violations):** Attys. Pedro and Gerard Linsangan:
    *   Failed to provide an accurate accounting of settlement amounts received.
    *   Improperly deducted attorney's fees in addition to those already deducted by collaborating Singapore counsel, Gurbani & Co., violating the Attorney-Client Contract.
    *   Did not promptly remit the funds due to the client upon demand.
    *   Improperly kept the client's funds in the firm's vault instead of a separate trust account.
*   **Attorney's Fees Dispute:** The court references the final and executory decision in Civil Case No. 2401 (affirmed in G.R. No. 205088) regarding the correct amount of attorney's fees. This decision prevents further adjustments to that specific issue in this disciplinary case based on the principle of immutability of judgments.
*   **Lack of Evidence Against Atty. Binoya:** The complaint against Atty. Glenda Linsangan-Binoya was dismissed due to a lack of evidence of her involvement in the unethical conduct.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Attys. Pedro and Gerard Linsangan:**
    *   Suspended from the practice of law for two years.
    *   Subject to any execution orders from the civil case (G.R. No. 205088) to refund any amount awarded to the complainant.
    *   A warning was issued that any similar future actions will be dealt with more severely

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Civil Case Judgment:** Respondents may face immediate execution of the judgment from the related civil case regarding the amount of attorney's fees owed.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The suspension and findings of unethical conduct may severely damage the respondents' professional reputation.
*   **Future Disciplinary Action:** A repetition of similar unethical conduct will result in harsher penalties, potentially including disbarment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):**
    *   Rule 1.03: Lawyer shall not encourage a suit for any corrupt motive.
    *   Rule 2.03: Lawyer shall not solicit legal business.
    *   Canon 3: Lawyer shall use only true, honest, fair, dignified, and objective information.
    *   Canon 16: Lawyer shall hold in trust all client's moneys and properties.
    *   Rule 16.01: Lawyer shall account for all money or property collected.
    *   Rule 16.03: Lawyer shall deliver funds when due.

*   **G.R. No. 205088:** Affirmed the CA decision regarding the attorney's fees dispute, rendering the issue *res judicata*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The contract between the parties stipulated to paying Atty. Pedro Linsangan and his collaborating Singapore Counsels a sum equivalent to thirty-five (35%) percent of any recovery or settlement obtained. However, it was unclear whether this thirty-five percent was going to be split between Atty. Linsangan and his collaborating Singapore Counsels. As such, the attorneys collected improper fees.
*   The attorney client contract between the parties lacked the proper accounting and clarity regarding who was responsible for which attorney fees.
