**Case Summary: *Hilario B. Aliling v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 230991, June 11, 2018 (833 Phil. 146)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's conviction of the petitioner, Hilario B. Aliling, for Frustrated Murder.

**Facts:**

*   Aliling was charged with Frustrated Murder for allegedly shooting Jerry Tumbaga.
*   The prosecution presented the victim and an eyewitness who identified Aliling as the shooter.
*   The defense presented Aliling's alibi, corroborated by one witness (Atienza), and an eyewitness (Bathan) who claimed Aliling was not the shooter.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Found Aliling guilty of Frustrated Murder, giving more weight to the prosecution's positive identification.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC Decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Crime Charged:** Frustrated Murder, requiring intent to kill, qualifying circumstances (treachery, evident premeditation), and incomplete execution due to a cause independent of the perpetrator's will (Article 6, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Issue:** Whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's judgment of conviction.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the CA decision and acquitted Aliling.
*   **Rationale:** The prosecution failed to prove Aliling's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence and found the defense's alibi and eyewitness testimony credible.

**Key Legal Arguments & Reasoning:**

*   **Presumption of Innocence:** Reiterated the fundamental right of the accused to the presumption of innocence.
*   **Positive Identification vs. Alibi:** While generally positive identification prevails, the Court stressed the importance of not readily dismissing alibi and denial. Cites *Lejano v. People*, 652 Phil. 512 (2010) to highlight that alibi and denial when found credible may serve as legitimate defense.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Discrepancies in testimonies of prosecution witnesses Jerry M. Tumbaga and Jesus C. Marasigan (the manner of execution) significantly undermined their credibility.
*   **Corroborating Evidence:** Adrian C. Atienza's testimony corroborated Aliling's alibi. Michael P. Bathan, the eyewitness, testimony bolster’s Aliling’s denial that he was not the gunman.
*    Testimonial evidence of the prosecution must conform to knowledge, observation, and experience.
*   **Reasonable Doubt:** The Court emphasized that proof beyond reasonable doubt is essential for conviction, and even a scintilla of doubt warrants acquittal. Cited *People v. Erguiza*, 592 Phil. 363 (2008).

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 6 (Frustrated Murder)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 45 (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Constitution, Article III, Sec. 14 (Presumption of Innocence)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The decision highlights the risk of over-reliance on "positive identification" without rigorous scrutiny of the credibility of witnesses and the potential for fabricated accusations.
*   The case underscores the importance of thoroughly evaluating alibi defenses and corroborating evidence, especially in the face of inconsistent prosecution testimonies.
*  The ambiguity and conflicting statements and arguments from the Prosecution eroded the credibility of the People's claim.

**Case Law:**

*   *Lejano v. People*, 652 Phil. 512 (2010): Emphasized the need for open-mindedness when evaluating alibi defenses.
*   *People v. Erguiza*, 592 Phil. 363 (2008): Stressed the importance of moral certainty for conviction and the constitutional duty to acquit when reasonable doubt exists.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision underscores the importance of upholding the presumption of innocence and requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal convictions. The court found critical inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence that negated Aliling's identification as the shooter. This case serves as a reminder to judges to keep an open mind and the need for evidence to conform to knowledge, observation, and experience in testimonies.
