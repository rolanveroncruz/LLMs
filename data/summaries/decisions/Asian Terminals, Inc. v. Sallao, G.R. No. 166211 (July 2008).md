## Legal Document Summary: Asian Terminals, Inc. vs. Sallao

**Case:** G.R. No. 166211, July 14, 2008 (580 Phil. 229)

**Subject Matter:** Illegal Dismissal

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Asian Terminals, Inc. (ATI)
*   **Respondent:** Nepthally B. Sallao & Asian Terminals, Inc. (Mariveles) Workers' Union

**Key Issue:** Validity of Sallao's dismissal for cause (theft of company property) and with due process.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals and NLRC decisions, finding that Sallao was validly dismissed. The Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing the complaint was reinstated.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Cause for Dismissal:** The Court found just cause for dismissal under Art. 282(a), (c), and (e) of the Labor Code.  It stated that theft of company property is a valid ground. Sallao's unauthorized disposition/sale of company property (electric copper wire cable) constituted theft. Court relied on Sallao's admission of the wrongdoing, as initially reported by Lt. Soriano.
*   **Due Process:** The Court held that ATI afforded Sallao due process.
    *   **Notice:** Sallao received a Memorandum (dated Sept. 24, 1998) informing him of the infraction and requiring explanation within 48 hours. He received a notice of termination informing him of the dismissal basis.
    *   **Opportunity to be heard:** The Court found that Sallao was given the opportunity to explain his side. Even though no face-to-face hearing was conducted, due process was met because Sallao had a chance to respond to the allegations in writing.  Sallao's general denial and request for counsel did not satisfy his obligation to provide a sufficient explanation.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 282:** Just causes for termination (specifically, serious misconduct, breach of trust, analogous causes)
*   **Labor Code, Articles 283 & 284:** Authorized causes for termination (not applicable here, but mentioned in the general discussion of dismissal requirements).
*   **Labor Code, Article 277** Miscellaneous Provisions. â€“ x x x

(b) Subject to the constitutional right of workers to security of tenure and their right to be protected against dismissal except for a just and authorized cause without prejudice to the requirement of notice under Article 283 of this Code, the employer shall furnish the worker whose employment is sought to be terminated a written notice containing a statement of the causes for termination and shall afford the latter ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative if he so desires in accordance with company rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to guidelines set by the Department of Labor and Employment. Any decision taken by the employer shall be without prejudice to the right of the worker to contest the validity or legality of his dismissal by filing a complaint with the regional branch of the National Labor Relations Commission. The burden of proving that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause shall rest on the employer.

**Case Law:**

*   *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. v. NLRC,* No. L-53552, October 18, 1988, 166 SCRA 422 (Theft of company property is valid cause)
*   *National Bookstore, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,* G.R. No. 146741, February 27, 2002, 378 SCRA 194 (Requirements for valid dismissal)
*   *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Barrientos,* G.R. No. 157028, January 31, 2006, 481 SCRA 311, (opportunity to be heard)
*   *King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac,* G.R. No. 166208, June 29, 2007, 526 SCRA 116, (hearing/conference is indispensable element of procedural due process)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The Separate Concurring Opinion of Justice Velasco, Jr., raises a pertinent consideration regarding the mandatory nature of a hearing/conference in procedural due process. Referencing the *King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac,* case, Justice Velasco, Jr., argues that a hearing is an indispensable element of due process. This opinion suggests a potential shift in jurisprudence, where the absence of a hearing, even with written explanations, could be deemed a breach of procedural due process.

**Potential Risks/Liabilities:**

*   **Future Challenges:** The case predates *King of Kings*. Subsequent cases may challenge dismissals where a hearing was not conducted, arguing a violation of procedural due process.
*   **Damages:** If a court later finds that the lack of a hearing violated Sallao's rights, ATI could be liable for backwages, separation pay (if applicable), and potentially damages (moral, exemplary).
*   **Precedent:** The case reinforces the principle that an admission can be strong evidence of guilt in employee misconduct cases, but the emphasis on a hearing as essential element may now need revisiting.
