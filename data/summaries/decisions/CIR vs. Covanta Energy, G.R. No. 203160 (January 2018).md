**Legal Document Summary: *Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Covanta Energy Philippine Holdings, Inc.*, G.R. No. 203160**

**Case Overview:** This is a petition for review on certiorari of a CTA en banc decision that affirmed the cancellation of deficiency VAT and MCIT assessments against Covanta Energy Philippine Holdings, Inc. (CEPHI) for the 2001 taxable year, due to CEPHI's availment of tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480. The CIR argues that CEPHI failed to fully comply with the requirements of the tax amnesty law, specifically regarding the Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN).

**Key Provisions and R.A. 9480 Analysis:**

*   **Tax Amnesty Law (R.A. No. 9480):** Governs the tax amnesty program for national internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior. The core issue revolves around compliance with the requirements for valid availment.
*   **SALN Requirements (Section 3, R.A. No. 9480 and DOF Department Order No. 29-07):** Requires declaration of assets, liabilities, and net worth as of December 31, 2005. Assets must be properly valued. The CIR's argument centers on CEPHI's failure to fill in the "Reference and Basis for Valuation" columns in its SALN.
*   **Compliance and Immunities (Section 6, R.A. No. 9480 and DOF Department Order No. 29-07):** Full compliance with documentary submissions and payment of the amnesty tax entitles the taxpayer to immunities and privileges. Failure to file SALN/Tax Amnesty Return or understatement of net worth by 30% or more removes these immunities.
*   **Presumption of Correctness (Section 4, R.A. No. 9480):** The SALN is presumed true and correct unless proven otherwise. The burden of proof rests on the party challenging the SALN (in this case, the CIR) to demonstrate an understatement of net worth by at least 30%. This proof must come from proceedings initiated by parties other than the BIR within one year or from findings in congressional, administrative, or court proceedings.

**Obligations:**

*   **CEPHI:** Had the obligation to fully comply with the documentary requirements of R.A. No. 9480, including a proper SALN, and to pay the applicable amnesty tax.
*   **CIR:** Had the burden to prove that CEPHI's SALN was materially deficient or understated its net worth by 30% or more.

**Liabilities:**

*   **CEPHI:** Remaining liable for deficiency Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT) and associated interest due to non-applicability of tax amnesty for withholding agents.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **SALN Sufficiency:** The central contentious point is whether the incomplete "Reference and Basis for Valuation" columns in CEPHI's SALN are sufficient grounds to invalidate the tax amnesty. The Court accepted CEPHI's argument that the attached schedules provided the necessary information. However, the ambiguity of this requirement and the possibility of challenges based on SALN deficiencies remains a risk.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The CIR failed to overcome the presumption of correctness attached to CEPHI's SALN. Future cases might hinge on the quality and accessibility of evidence presented to demonstrate understatement of net worth.
*   **Tax Amnesty Scope:**  The tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480 has already expired and is a one-time availment.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9480:** Tax Amnesty Law for 2005 and prior years.
*   **DOF Department Order No. 29-07:** Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9480.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended:** Defines deficiency and delinquency interests in Sections 249(B) and 249(C).
*   ***CS Garment, Inc. v. CIR***, 729 Phil. 253 (2014): Cited regarding the suspensive and resolutory conditions of tax amnesty.
*   ***CIR v. Apo Cement Corporation***, G.R. No. 193381, February 8, 2017: Tax amnesty eligibility.

**Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CTA's decision, holding that CEPHI was entitled to the tax amnesty benefits because it substantially complied with the requirements of R.A. No. 9480, and the CIR failed to prove an understatement of net worth by 30% or more.
