Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Cesar Cantalejo y Manlangit*, G.R. No. 182790, April 24, 2009.

**Issue:** Appeal of conviction for violation of Section 5, R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), specifically for the illegal sale of 0.08 gram of methylamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). The Appellant alleged frame-up and unconstitutional search and seizure.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court REVERSED the Court of Appeals' decision and ACQUITTED the Appellant based on reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Elements of Illegal Sale (R.A. 9165, Sec. 5):** The prosecution must prove: (1) the transaction/sale occurred; (2) the *corpus delicti* (illicit drug) was presented as evidence; and (3) the buyer and seller were identified.
*   **Presumption of Innocence:** The prosecution failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. They failed to refute the defense's theory of frame-up and unconstitutional search.
*   **Unlawful Search and Seizure:** The defense presented evidence that the police entered and searched their home without a warrant, looking for shabu, and the officers were not even sure who Cesar was, calling into question the buy-bust operation.
*   **Chain of Custody (R.A. 9165, Sec. 21):** The Court found the prosecution failed to conclusively establish the identity and integrity of the *corpus delicti* (shabu) due to significant deviations from the mandated procedures.
*   **Lack of Inventory and Photograph:** The failure to physically inventory and photograph the seized item immediately after seizure in the presence of the accused, or his representative, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and an elected public official (as required by Section 21 of R.A. 9165) created reasonable doubt. No explanation was provided for the non-compliance.
*   **Failure to Present Rebuttal Evidence:** The prosecution's failure to present rebuttal evidence to counter the defense's testimony regarding the warrantless search and frame-up significantly weakened their case.
*   **Insufficient Evidence of Buy-Bust:** PO1 Cruda did not see the deal occur.

    *   Section 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs)
    *   Section 21 (Custody and Disposition of Confiscated Drugs)

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties by police officers can be rebutted by evidence of non-compliance with mandatory procedures (R.A. 9165, Sec. 21).
*   The testimony of the police officers was contradictory, and the police failed to call other witnesses to support their version of events.
*   Failure to follow chain of custody guidelines can invalidate the evidence, even with positive lab results.
