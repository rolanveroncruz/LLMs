**Case:** *Republic of the Philippines vs. Agripina dela Raga*, G.R. No. 161042, August 24, 2009 (Reconstitution of Title)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order to reconstitute Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 49266 in the names of Ignacio Serran, Catalina Laguit, Felipe Serafica, and Cornelia Serran. The petitioner for reconstitution, Agripina dela Raga, claimed to be the granddaughter and sole surviving heir of Ignacio Serran and presented evidence, including Decree No. 196266, to support her claim. The Republic opposed, arguing that Dela Raga failed to sufficiently prove her relationship to the registered owner and that the Register of Deeds' certification was inadequate to establish that the OCT was valid and subsisting at the time of its loss.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Reconstitution Granted:** The SC upheld the lower courts' decisions, ordering the reconstitution of the OCT.

*   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The RTC found Dela Raga's evidence, including the decree, tax declarations, and testimony, sufficient to establish her interest in the property and the validity of the original title. The SC deferred to the factual findings of the lower courts.

*   **Register of Deeds' Report:** The SC ruled that the report from the Register of Deeds is not an indispensable requirement for reconstitution cases.  Citing *Puzon v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.* (406 Phil. 263, 278 (2001)), the court states that such report may be disregarded.  Even LRA Circular No. 35 does not require any clearance.

*   **Compliance with RA No. 26 (Section 15):** The SC found that Dela Raga met the requirements for reconstitution under Section 15 of Republic Act No. 26, which governs reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title.

*   **Binding Factual Findings:** The SC reiterated the principle that factual findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the SC, unless specific exceptions are applicable (which the Republic failed to demonstrate).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Dela Raga's Obligation:** Demonstrated sufficient evidence per RA No. 26 to warrant reconstitution.
*   **Republic's Liability:** Failed to rebut Dela Raga's evidence.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Heirship Claim:** The Republic initially challenged Dela Raga's proof of heirship. While the courts found her evidence sufficient, challenges by other potential heirs are possible in future proceedings.
*   **Overlapping Claims:** The Republic insinuated that other titles might exist covering the same property. Though this wasn't proven, it remains a potential risk for future disputes.
*   **Lack of Indefeasibility:** A reconstituted title does not necessarily confer an indefeasible right. It stands in place of the lost original, and any defects or encumbrances existing on the original title would be carried over to the reconstituted title.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 26 (RA 26):** Law governing the reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificates of title. Specifically, Section 15 is cited.
*   **Land Registration Authority (LRA) Circular No. 35:** Guidelines for reconstitution proceedings (while not a controlling statute, it was cited by the Republic).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Puzon v. Sta. Lucia Realty and Development, Inc.** (406 Phil. 263, 278 (2001)): Established that a report from the LRA is not indispensable for reconstitution.
*   **Republic v. Casimiro** (G.R. No. 166139, 20 June 2006, 491 SCRA 499, 523-524): Affirmed the mandatory nature of the court's duty to issue an order of reconstitution when basic requirements are met.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in the completeness and accuracy of the evidence presented to prove the validity of the title at the time of loss. While the courts found the evidence sufficient, future litigation based on conflicting claims or previously unknown encumbrances is possible. The age of the original title and the fact that it was registered in the name of two sets of spouses could potentially give rise to complications in the future.
