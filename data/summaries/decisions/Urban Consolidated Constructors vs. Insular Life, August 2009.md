**Case Summary: *Urban Consolidated Constructors Philippines, Inc. v. The Insular Life Assurance Co., Inc.* (G.R. No. 180824, August 28, 2009)**

**Key Issue:** Whether Urban is liable for liquidated damages for construction delays under the General Construction Agreement (GCA).

**Facts:**

*   Insular engaged Urban to construct a building. Multiple extensions were granted.
*   Urban sued Insular for sum of money and damages, alleging Insular caused the delay by failing to disclose a road widening project and boundary dispute, delaying approvals/payments, and delaying materials delivery.
*   Insular counterclaimed for liquidated damages.
*   RTC ruled in favor of Urban.
*   CA reversed in part, awarding liquidated damages to Insular but reducing the amount and ordering Insular to pay certain amounts to Urban.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **GCA, Section 1, Article V:** Urban is obligated to "furnish and supply all necessary materials, labor, equipment, and tools" for construction.
*   **Liquidated Damages Clause:** 1/10 of 1% of the contract price (P38,885,000.00) per day of delay. Section 2, Article XIV of GCA allows Insular to deduct liquidated damages from retained amounts or balances due to Urban.
*   Letters and meeting minutes detailed agreed cost of major materials purchased by Urban shall be paid directly by Insular upon presentation of invoice.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Urban:** Found liable for liquidated damages due to construction delays, although the amount was reduced.
*   **Insular:** Initially liable to pay Urban P1,144,030.94 for the balance of unpaid change orders and P2,134,908.80 for the unpaid retention money.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2227, Civil Code:** Liquidated damages, whether indemnity or penalty, may be equitably reduced if iniquitous or unconscionable.
*   **Article 1229, Civil Code:** The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.
*   **Filinvest Land, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 138980, September 20, 2005):** Applied Article 2227, reducing liquidated damages, considering completion percentage and absence of bad faith, also due to counter performance by the other party.
*   **Titan Construction Corporation v. Uni-Field Enterprises, Inc., (G.R. No. 153874, March 1, 2007):** reiterate that the courts may reduce the stipulated penalty in the contract where the principal obligation has been partly performed and where the penalty is iniquitous.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Supply Obligation:** Urban argued Insular assumed responsibility for procuring major materials, which the Court rejected based on the GCA language and subsequent actions of the parties indicating financial assistance only.
*   **Amount of Liquidated Damages:** The Court of Appeals and Supreme Court both found the initial liquidated damages amount to be unconscionable and reduced it, demonstrating the court's power to intervene.
*   **Offsetting:** CA and SC upheld Insular's right to offset liquidated damages against amounts owed to Urban.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court partially granted Urban's petition, affirming the Court of Appeals decision with a modification further reducing the liquidated damages from P2,940,000.00 to P1,940,000.00, considering Insular's failure to pay for change orders and retention money.
