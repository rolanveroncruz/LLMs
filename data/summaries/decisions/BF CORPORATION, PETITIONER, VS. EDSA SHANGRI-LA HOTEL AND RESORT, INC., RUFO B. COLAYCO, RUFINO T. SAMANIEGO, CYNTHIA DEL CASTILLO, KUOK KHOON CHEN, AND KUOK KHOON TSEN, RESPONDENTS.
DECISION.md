## Legal Document Summary: *BF Corporation v. EDSA Shangri-La Hotel and Resort, Inc.*, G.R. No. 132655, August 11, 1998

**Case Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision setting aside the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) order granting execution pending appeal in favor of BF Corporation (BF) against EDSA Shangri-La Hotel and Resort, Inc. (ESHRI) for unpaid construction work. The CA also issued prohibitory and mandatory injunctions against the RTC's execution.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Execution Pending Appeal (Rule 39, Sec. 2, Rules of Civil Procedure):**  The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision that the RTC's reasons for granting execution pending appeal were insufficient. BF's financial distress was *not* a valid justification. The Court cited *Philippine Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals* that a juridical entity's financial distress isn't equivalent to a natural person's dire circumstances like illness or old age. Impending insolvency of the *adverse party* or a patently dilatory appeal are better justifications. The SC reiterates its prior rulings in *David v. Court of Appeals* and *Roxas v. Court of Appeals* stating posting a bond is insufficient for execution pending appeal.
*   **Injunctions:** The SC upheld the CA's issuance of preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunctions. The motions supporting the injunction were based on a verified petition with sufficient factual averments. BF was afforded due process via its comment on the petition.
*   **Restitution:** The SC modified the CA decision regarding restitution of garnished deposits. It held that ESHRI should proceed against BF's bond (P35 million) under Rule 39, Section 5, of the Rules of Civil Procedure which allows the court to order restitution or reparation of damages. The procedure under Rule 57, Section 20, regarding irregular attachments applies, requiring notice to the surety and a hearing before liability is determined. Cites *Luzon Surety Co. v. Beson*.
*   **Certiorari Remedy:** The SC held that certiorari was a proper remedy to challenge the RTC's order granting execution pending appeal, citing *David v. Court of Appeals*, *Provident International Resources Corp. v. Court of Appeals*, and *Jaca v. Davao Lumber Co*. Appeal is not a speedy and adequate remedy in such cases.

**Obligations:**

*   BF Corporation initially had an obligation to perform construction work to the agreed-upon standards and timeframe.
*   ESHRI had the obligation to pay BF Corporation for the construction work completed according to the contract terms.
*   BF Corporation is now obligated to allow ESHRI to recover the garnished amounts via the security bond as per the decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   ESHRI was initially held liable by the RTC for unpaid construction work, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs. However, the CA set aside this judgment.
*   BF Corporation is now potentially liable to ESHRI up to the amount of the security bond.
*   The surety is contingently liable under the bond to ESHRI, but must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Bond Sufficiency:** The P35 million bond may or may not be sufficient to cover ESHRI's total damages.
*   **Surety Litigation:** Determining the surety's liability could lead to further litigation.
*   **Appellate Review of Underlying Case:** The underlying case regarding the debt is still under appeal, and the outcome could shift liability.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The original construction contract is not provided, making it impossible to analyze potential ambiguities or contentious clauses within it. The court decisions refer to disagreements on what constitutes ‘completed’ work and the amounts owed.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 39, Sec. 2, Rules of Civil Procedure (Execution Pending Appeal)
*   Rule 39, Sec. 5, Rules of Civil Procedure (Restitution)
*   Rule 57, Sec. 20, Rules of Civil Procedure (Recovery of Damages on Attachment Bond)
