**Case Summary: Singa Ship Management Phils., Inc. vs. NLRC and Mario Sangil, G.R. No. 119080, April 14, 1998**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Private respondent Mario Sangil was hired as a utility man/assistant steward by petitioner Singa Ship Management on behalf of Royal Cruise Line for 12 months at a monthly salary of US$50.
*   **Cause of Termination:** An altercation between Sangil and a Greek crew member (Zakkas) resulted in Sangil's injury and subsequent departure from the vessel.

**Obligations:**

*   The petitioners had an obligation to provide a safe working environment for Sangil. The captain, as agent of the shipowner, has a responsibility to supervise crew and ensure safety.
*   The contract between the parties stipulated the compensation for the time frame it was active for, and the conditions of the same.

**Liabilities:**

*   The NLRC found petitioners jointly and severally liable for US$500 representing Sangil's salary for the unexpired portion of his contract, plus 10% attorney's fees. This was upheld by the Supreme Court.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Constructive Dismissal:** The court characterized Sangil's departure as constructive dismissal, applying *People's Security, Inc. v. NLRC* and *Philippine Advertising Counselors, Inc. v. NLRC*. The key issue is that his continued employment was rendered impossible due to well founded fear for his safety.
*   **Vicarious Liability:** The court appears to apply a vicarious liability standard to the ship captain's failure to prevent the abuse and ensure Sangil's safety.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** While not explicitly cited, the decision implies a breach of duty of care owed to an employee under the Labor Code.
*   **People's Security, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 96451, 226 SCRA 146 (1993):** Cited for the definition of constructive dismissal.
*   **Philippine Advertising Counselors, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 120008, 263 SCRA 395 (1996):** Further clarified the concept of constructive dismissal.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Logbook Abstract confirmed that there was an altercation of some kind, but the petitioners contested that this was not due to their negligence. The NLRC found that the victim was not the aggressor and his account was valid.
*   The interpretation of Sangil's departure as voluntary versus constructive dismissal was a key point of contention.

**Legal Precision and Analysis:**

The Court's decision rests on the NLRC's factual findings, particularly the Logbook Abstract, which contradicted the petitioners' version of events. The Court deferred to the NLRC's assessment of witness credibility and interpretation of evidence. The Court focused on whether the actions of the Captain created a hostile environment which led to constructive dismissal. The findings of fact of the NLRC, if supported by the evidence, should be respected by this Court. The ultimate decision was that the employee's decision to leave the ship was not voluntary, and that it was the duty of the shipowner to provide the proper working conditions and to prevent the employee's endangerment.
