## Legal Document Summary: People v. Conlu, G.R. No. 225213

**Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC's conviction of Ceasar Conlu for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs). The Supreme Court **reversed** the conviction.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Violation Charged:** Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs) based on a buy-bust operation.
*   **Lower Court Findings:** RTC found Conlu guilty; CA affirmed.  The RTC acquitted Conlu in a separate case (Crim. Case No. 8615-69) related to possession of drugs found during a subsequent search at the police station.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** Acquittal due to (1) failure to prove the illegal sale beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) failure to prove an unbroken chain of custody.
*   **Critical Witness:** Absence of the poseur-buyer as a witness deemed critical, especially given the distance between the observing police officers and the alleged transaction. The testimony of PO2 Libo-on was ambiguous, stating he 'believed' it to be shabu without giving descriptions.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Testimony was unclear regarding the transfer of the seized item from the poseur-buyer to PO2 Bernil. There was also no testimony regarding who had custody of the buy-bust item from PO2 Bernil to the police station.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the sale of dangerous drugs.
*   **RA 9165, Section 21, Article II:**  Outlines the procedure for custody and disposition of seized drugs.
*   **Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576 (2008):** Established the chain of custody rule for authenticating evidence.
*   **People v. Ismael, G.R. No. 208093, 20 February 2017, 818 SCRA 122.:** Strengthens the importance of the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Andaya, 745 Phil. 237 (2014):** Underscores the importance of the poseur-buyer's testimony.
*   **People v. Casacop, 755 Phil. 265 (2015):** Reinforces the view that if buy bust item is minuscule, the poseur-buyer must be presented as a witness.
*   **Sindac v. People, 794 Phil. 421 (2016):** The court considered the distance between the police officer and the alleged drug transaction.
*   **People v. Guzon, 719 Phil. 441 (2013):** The Court finds that the prosecution failed to prove that the illegal sale actually transpired, given the distance between the police officer and the poseur-buyer.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Police Testimony:** The prosecution's case heavily relied on the police officers' testimonies, which the court deemed insufficient due to distance and lack of specific descriptions of the transaction.
*   **Missing Witness:** Failure to present the poseur-buyer created reasonable doubt about whether a sale actually occurred.
*   **Chain of Custody Issues:** Ambiguity in the chain of custody raised questions about the integrity and identity of the seized drugs. The courts did not establish whether PO2 Bernil or PO2 Libo-on had custody of the buy-bust item.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court acquitted the accused due to significant gaps in the prosecution's evidence regarding the elements of illegal sale and the chain of custody, emphasizing the necessity of reliable eyewitness accounts and strict adherence to the procedural requirements of RA 9165.
