## Legal Document Summary: *People vs. Alpapara, et al.*

**Case:** G.R. No. 180421, *People of the Philippines vs. Domingo Alpapara, Pedro Alpapara, Alden Paya and Mario Bicuna*, October 30, 2009.

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for murder.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction:** Domingo Alpapara, Pedro Alpapara, and Alden Paya were convicted of murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), qualified by treachery. Mario Bicuna, the driver, was acquitted due to insufficient evidence of conspiracy or accessory liability.
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion Perpetua for Domingo, Pedro and Alden, without possibility of parole (due to RA 9346).
*   **Civil Liabilities:** Joint and several liability for Domingo, Pedro, and Alden to the victim's heirs.
    *   Civil indemnity of PHP 75,000.00
    *   Moral damages of PHP 50,000.00
    *   Temperate damages of PHP 25,000.00 (in lieu of proven actual damages)

**Basis of Liability:**

*   **Murder:** The crime was qualified by treachery (alevosia). The appellants restrained the victim (Pedro and Alden held Gomez) to enable the killing (Domingo shot Gomez from behind).
*   **Conspiracy:** Established by the coordinated actions of Domingo, Pedro, and Alden before, during, and after the commission of the crime, indicating a joint purpose and concert of action to kill the victim.
*   **Acquittal of Bicuna:** The prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bicuna was aware of the appellants' intent to kill the victim, or that he intended to assist the escape of the appellants.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Witness Credibility:** Appellants questioned the credibility of prosecution witnesses (e.g., conflicting statements, political rivalry). However, the Court found these discrepancies minor and upheld the trial court's assessment.
*   **Circumstances of Death:** The defense tried to argue self-defense and inconsistent physical evidence (cartridge cases vs. witness testimony). However, the Court dismissed those claims based on the nature and location of the wounds.
*   **Treachery:** Appellants argued that the argument preceding the attack negated treachery. However, the Court emphasized the lapse of time and the manner of execution (restraining the victim) prevented him from defending himself, thus establishing treachery.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision convicting Domingo Alpapara, Pedro Alpapara, and Alden Paya of murder, qualified by treachery and committed in conspiracy. The court ruled that Mario Bicuna had no participation. The convictions of the appellants hinged on the prosecution's eyewitness testimony, which the Court found credible despite minor inconsistencies. The Court rejected the defense's arguments regarding the lack of treachery. As the death penalty was prohibited by law, the appellants were sentenced to reclusion perpetua. Civil liabilities were also awarded. The Court acquitted Mario Bicuna due to insufficient evidence of his knowledge of the plan or intent to help the perpetrators escape.
