## Legal Document Summary: Cabreros vs. COA (G.R. No. 266713 & 270183)

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 assailing COA decisions disallowing payments and holding petitioners solidarily liable.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of COA disallowance of PHP 5,103,000.00 payment for Combat Clothing and Individual Equipment (CCIE) items procured by the Philippine Army through "shopping" instead of public bidding, and the solidary liability of involved officers.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioners:** L/C Cabreros, L/C Zumel, and L/C Dosado (Philippine Army Officers)
*   **Respondent:** Commission on Audit (COA)

**Background:**
*   Army Support Command (ASCOM) received six Procurement Directives (PDs) for CCIE items.
*   Philippine Army's Bids, Negotiations and Acceptance Committee (BNAC), including Petitioners, procured the items via "shopping" due to perceived urgency.
*   COA issued a Notice of Disallowance (ND No. 10-001-101(03)) based on splitting of contracts to avoid public bidding (COA Circular No. 76-41 & RA 9184).
*   Petitioners appealed, ultimately reaching the Supreme Court after denials from COA Regional Director and COA Proper based on procedural grounds (late filing).
*   Criminal charges (Sec. 3(e) RA 3019, Art. 171 RPC) were filed against the public officers before the Sandiganbayan, and administrative cases before the Ombudsman. The Sandiganbayan acquitted, while the CA modified Cabreros' administrative liability to simple misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**
*   **COA Circular No. 76-41:** Prohibits splitting of requisitions, purchase orders, and payments.
*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and its 2003 IRR:** Mandates public bidding; alternative methods (like shopping) are exceptions with strict limitations.
*   **Section 52, IRR of RA 9184:**  Limits "shopping" to PHP 50,000 (unforeseen contingency) or PHP 250,000 (ordinary supplies unavailable in Procurement Service) and prohibits contract splitting.
*   **Torreta v. COA:**  Guidelines on return of disallowed amounts in government contracts.
*   **Sections 38 & 43, Administrative Code of 1987; Section 103, PD 1445:** Defines liability of public officers for illegal expenditures requires "bad faith, malice, or gross negligence".
*   **Duties of BNAC/BAC:** Ensure compliance with procurement laws, recommend procurement methods.

**Liabilities:**
*   Initially, COA held Petitioners solidarily liable for the disallowed amount.

**Rulings:**
*   **COA:** Upheld the disallowance, found splitting of contracts to avoid public bidding.
*   **Sandiganbayan:** Acquitted Petitioners of criminal charges (lack of corrupt intent).
*   **Court of Appeals:** Dismissed administrative case vs. Dosado; reduced Cabreros' liability to simple misconduct (lack of bad faith); Zumel's case pending.
*   **Supreme Court:**
    *   Upheld COA's disallowance (violation of RA 9184 by using "shopping" without valid justification), despite late filing, due to "substantial justice" considerations (actual delivery, acquittal by Sandiganbayan, CA's findings).
    *   Excused Petitioners from the solidary liability due to good faith. Dosado, as BNAC Secretary, was performing ministerial duties. Cabreros and Zumel were entitled to the presumption of good faith, malice, or gross negligence when issuing the Notice to Proceed to Shopping since these were ruled out by Sandiganbayan and CA. Court of Appeal found that there was “lack of bad faith on his part” and government never sustained any loss.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Application of "Good Faith" defense:** The reliance on the Sandiganbayan and Court of Appeals' findings regarding the lack of corrupt intent and bad faith is crucial. This is a factual determination. Singh J. dissenting opinion argued that reliance on Sandiganbayan acquittal based on insufficient evidence of profit, not good faith. Moreover, CA decision did not explicitly declare good faith.
*   **"Splitting of Contracts" Interpretation:** The case highlights the importance of correctly interpreting and applying the rules against splitting contracts.
*   **Ministerial vs. Discretionary Duties:** Clearly delineating the nature of duties (ministerial vs. discretionary) is vital in determining individual liability. *PNP-CIDG v. Villafuerte*, 840 Phil. 243, 256-257 (2018).
*   **Quantum Meruit:**  The SC declined to apply *quantum meruit* as government did not suffer any loss by reason of BNAC’s decision to resort to shopping in procuring the subject items

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **RA 9184 & IRR:** Government Procurement Reform Act.
*   **COA Circular No. 76-41:** Prohibition against splitting.
*   **RA 3019, Sec. 3(e):** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 171:** Falsification of Public Documents.
*   **Torreta v. COA:** Return of disallowed amounts in government contracts.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Sections 38, 39 & 43:**  Liability of public officers.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1445, Section 103:**  Government Auditing Code of the Philippines
*    *PNP-CIDG v. Villafuerte*, 840 Phil. 243, 256-257 (2018)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court excused the petitioners from solidary liability, despite upholding the COA disallowance. The reliance on the absence of corrupt intent/bad faith, and the interpretation of the scope of their duties in determining their liability is crucial. The finality of judgements/administrative cases is also a key consideration. Singh J's dissent emphasizes that it was error to excuse Cabreros and Zumel since good faith had not been properly established. This case underscores the complexities of procurement law and the importance of procedural compliance, while balancing it with substantial justice considerations.
