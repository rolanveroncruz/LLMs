**Case Summary: People v. Barrera, G.R. No. 232337 (2018)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Accused-Appellant (Barrera) for violation of Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 (Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of 0.03 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu). The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA and RTC decisions, acquitting Barrera.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Criminalizes the sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, giving away, distribution, dispatch in transit, or transportation of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 (Chain of Custody Rule):**  Mandates a specific procedure for handling seized drugs, requiring immediate physical inventory and photography after seizure in the presence of (1) the accused or their representative/counsel, (2) a media representative, (3) a DOJ representative, and (4) an elected public official.  These witnesses must sign the inventory. Within 24 hours of seizure, the drugs must be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Conviction under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165:** Carries a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of Five Hundred Thousand (P500,000.00) Pesos.
*   **Risk of wrongful conviction:** Arises from non-compliance with Section 21, RA 9165, creating doubt about the integrity of the *corpus delicti*.

**Key Issues & SC Ruling:**

*   **Integrity of the *Corpus Delicti***: The SC found that the prosecution failed to establish the integrity of the *corpus delicti* due to significant breaches in the chain of custody mandated by Section 21 of RA 9165.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21, RA 9165:** The prosecution demonstrably failed to comply with the requirement that the inventory and photograph be taken immediately after seizure in the presence of the accused and the mandatory insulating witnesses (media, DOJ, elected official). Marking of the evidence also occurred in the police station, not at the scene of the crime.
*   **Justifiable Ground for Non-Compliance:** The prosecution failed to offer a "justifiable ground" to explain the absence of insulating witnesses as required by jurisprudence (e.g., *People v. Dumagay, G.R. No. 216753, February 7, 2018*; *People v. Crispo, G.R. No. 230065, March 14, 2018*).  The apprehending officer incorrectly believed it was not his responsibility to contact these witnesses, and the court cannot presume justifiable grounds.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5 and Section 21.**
*   **People v. Binasing, G.R. No. 221439, July 4, 2018.**
*   **People v. Dumagay, G.R. No. 216753, February 7, 2018.**
*   **People v. Crispo, G.R. No. 230065, March 14, 2018.**
*   **People v. Ferrer, G.R. No. 213914, June 6, 2018.**
*   **People v. Almorfe, et al., 631 Phil 51, 60 (2010).**

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "immediately after seizure" requirement of Section 21. The prosecution's failure to mark at the scene and the delay in inventory raised significant questions about the evidence's integrity.

**Potential Arguments/Analysis:**

*   This case underscores the importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of RA 9165. Failure to comply, without a proven and justifiable reason, is *prima facie* evidence that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs have been compromised, thus warranting acquittal based on reasonable doubt. The burden is on the prosecution to prove compliance and justify any deviations.  Reliance on presumptions or self-serving statements by officers is insufficient.
*   The SC emphasizes that it cannot presume the existence of justifiable grounds for non-compliance; such grounds must be proven as a matter of fact.
