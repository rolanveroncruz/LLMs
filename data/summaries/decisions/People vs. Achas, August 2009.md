## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Achas* (G.R. No. 185712)

**Case Overview:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision convicting Lilio U. Achas of two counts of rape committed against his common-law stepdaughter, [AAA], under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by RA 8353. The death penalty was reduced to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole due to RA 9346.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Article 266-A, RPC (as amended):** Defines rape. The conviction is based on the element of the victim being under twelve years old. The crime is statutory rape.
*   **RA 8353:** Amends the Revised Penal Code, increasing penalties for rape.
*   **RA 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, resulting in the penalty being reduced to reclusion perpetua. The court applied to this case.
*    Victim's testimony is the basis for the conviction.
*   Alibi as the accused's defense. The court found that alibi does not exist because the provinces were near to each other.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Achas):** Found guilty of two counts of rape and sentenced to reclusion perpetua for each count, *without* eligibility for parole (due to RA 9346). Ordered to pay:
    *   PhP 75,000 civil indemnity per count
    *   PhP 75,000 moral damages per count
    *   PhP 30,000 exemplary damages per count (increased from CA's PhP 25,000 based on *People v. Sia*).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Credibility:** The case heavily relies on the credibility of the victim's testimony. The defense questioned inconsistencies, focusing on the lack of hymenal lacerations and external physical injuries. However, the Court gives deference to trial court findings on credibility, especially when the victim is a minor and that is not proof to support the absence of rape.
*   **Alibi:** Alibi is a weak defense. The court found the accused was not able to prove that it was physically impossible for him to go to the place of the crime scene.
*   **Evidence and witnesses:** The testimony of the accused's son was not considered to be credible, because it came from the family of the accused.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Mateo (G.R. Nos. 147678-87):** This case was the reason for the transfer of records to the CA.
*   **People v. Buyok (G.R. No. 109771):** Cited by the RTC regarding the implausibility of a young virgin falsely accusing someone of sexual abuse.
*   **People v. Sia (G.R. No. 174059):** Cited to justify the increased award of exemplary damages.
*   The Court cited several other cases to support rulings on credibility of witnesses, the impact of a minor's testimony, the subjective nature of intimidation in rape, and the corroborative nature of medical evidence (*People v. Barangan, People v. Corpuz, People v. Bidoc, People v. Arsayo, People v. Quiachon, People v. Ceballos, People v. Balonzo, People v. Candaza, People v. San Antonio, People v. Castro, People v. Espino, People v. Sambrano, People v. Logmao, People v. dela Cruz, People v. Lizano, People v. Robles, People v. Resuma, People v. Gonzales, People v. Nazareno, People v. De Guzman*).

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 266-A and 266-B:** Definition and penalties for rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 8353:** Amendment to the Revised Penal Code, increasing penalties for rape.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibition of the death penalty.
*   **Republic Act No. 7610:** Protection of children.
*   **Republic Act No. 9262:** Protection of women and their children.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The defense argued that the absence of hymenal lacerations cast doubt on the victim's testimony. The Court explicitly rejected this, citing jurisprudence that hymenal laceration is not an element of rape.
*   The credibility of the victim's testimony vs. that of the accused and his son.

**Summary:** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for rape based primarily on the credible testimony of the minor victim. The defense of alibi and denial were rejected, as was the argument regarding the lack of medical evidence of penetration. The penalty was reduced due to the abolition of the death penalty, but the accused will serve life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
