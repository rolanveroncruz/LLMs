## Legal Document Summary: *Kim Liong v. People of the Philippines* G.R. No. 200630

**Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Orders that declared Petitioner Kim Liong (Liong) to have waived his right to cross-examine prosecution witness Antonio Dela Rama (Dela Rama).

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC gravely abused its discretion in declaring Liong's right to cross-examine Dela Rama waived.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) DENIED the petition, affirming the CA decision and RTC Orders. The SC held that the right to cross-examine, while constitutionally guaranteed, is a personal right that can be waived, expressly or impliedly. Liong, by his conduct of repeatedly delaying the proceedings, changing counsels, and failing to attend hearings, was deemed to have waived this right.

**Facts:**

*   Liong was charged with Estafa under the Revised Penal Code for allegedly failing to return USD 50,955.70 erroneously deposited into his account by Equitable PCI Bank.
*   Liong pleaded not guilty.
*   The prosecution presented witness Dela Rama, whose direct examination was concluded on January 25, 2007.
*   Numerous resettings of Dela Rama's cross-examination occurred, attributed to Liong's counsel's absence, Liong changing counsel, and even Liong's own absences.
*   The RTC, finding Liong's actions dilatory, declared his right to cross-examine Dela Rama waived. The CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article III, Section 14 of the Constitution:** Guarantees the right of an accused to confront and cross-examine witnesses.
*   **Rule 115, Section 1(f) of the Rules of Court:** Reaffirms the accused's right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.
*   **Doctrine of Waiver:** The right to cross-examine can be waived by conduct. *People v. Narca*, 341 Phil. 696 (1997) states that mere opportunity, and not actual cross examination, is the essence of the right to cross examine. *Gimenez v. Nazareno*, 243 Phil. 274 (1988) states that an escapee does not retain the rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses against him.

**Liabilities:**

*   Liong is bound by the negligence of his counsel, absent a showing of gross negligence.
*   Liong is liable for the consequences of his dilatory tactics, including the waiver of his right to cross-examine.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Conviction based on the direct examination of Dela Rama, without the benefit of cross-examination.
*   Argument regarding ineffective assistance of counsel is weakened due to documented history of changing legal representation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article III, Section 14**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 115, Section 1(f)**
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45, Section 1**
*   *People v. Narca*, 341 Phil. 696 (1997)
*   *Gimenez v. Nazareno*, 243 Phil. 274 (1988)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The assessment of whether the resettings were genuinely beyond Liong's control. The SC sided with the lower courts in attributing a significant portion to Liong's actions.
*   Degree of Negligence of prior counsel. The Court finds that the delays were not solely the counsel's fault.

**Overall Assessment:**

Liong faces a high risk of conviction. The SC affirmed the waiver of his right to cross-examine, and the case will proceed based on the existing record. Any remaining defense strategy will need to focus on attacking the prosecution's evidence that was presented during the direct examination of Dela Rama, and finding other defense witnesses.
