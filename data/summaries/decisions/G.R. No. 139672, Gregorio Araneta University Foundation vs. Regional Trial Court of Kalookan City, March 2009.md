## Legal Document Summary: Gregorio Araneta University Foundation vs. The Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City, Branch 120, et al. (G.R. No. 139672, March 04, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming the CA decision that upheld the RTC orders directing the cancellation of GAUF's TCT No. C-24153 and issuance of new titles to the Heirs of Gregorio Bajamonde over Lots 54 and 75 of the Gonzales Estate.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Expropriation & Subsequent Actions:** The Gonzales Estate was expropriated by the Republic.  Occupants later filed Civil Case No. C-760 to compel sale of occupied portions.
*   **"Kasunduan" and Compromise Agreement:** GAUF intervened in C-760 based on a "Kasunduan" with tenants conveying priority purchase rights. A compromise agreement was submitted and approved, awarding Lots 75 and 54 to Gregorio Bajamonde.
*   **GAUF's Title:** GAUF obtained TCT No. C-24153 for Lots 75 and 54 based on the "Kasunduan" and compromise agreement.
*   **Declaration of Nullity:**  In Civil Cases Nos. 17347 and 17364 (affirmed in CA-G.R. No. 45330-R), the "Kasunduan" and compromise agreement were declared null and void for being a forgery.
*   **RTC Orders:** The RTC in Civil Case No. C-760 issued orders canceling GAUF's TCT No. C-24153 and directing issuance of new titles to Bajamonde heirs.
*   **GAUF's Arguments:** GAUF argued the RTC lacked jurisdiction to cancel its title, constituting a prohibited collateral attack under Section 48 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree).  GAUF also claimed the RTC order amended a final and executory order dismissing Bajamonde's complaint. They cited *Zaide, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals, 184 SCRA 531* on void judgments.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **GAUF:** Obligation to surrender TCT No. C-24153. Liability for costs of suit.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligation to cancel TCT No. C-24153 and issue new titles to Bajamonde heirs.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Title:** GAUF permanently loses title to Lots 54 and 75.
*   **Enforcement:**  Already existing Writ of Execution against GAUF, its privies, and successors can be enforced.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 48:**  Prohibition against collateral attack on a certificate of title.
*   **Rule 47, Revised Rules of Civil Procedure:**  Grounds for annulment of judgment (lack of jurisdiction or extrinsic fraud).
*   **Mallilin, Jr. v. Castillo, G.R. No. 136803, June 16, 2000, 333 SCRA 628:** Defines direct vs. collateral attack on title.
*   **Dolfo v. Register of Deeds for the Province of Cavite, G.R. No. 133465, September 25, 2000, 341 SCRA 58:**  Validity of title based on origin.
*   **Baguio v. Republic, G.R. No. 119682, January 21, 1999, 301 SCRA 450:** Indefeasibility of title and fraud.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of "Kasunduan" and Compromise Agreement:** Despite their nullity, GAUF attempts to argue that the title was not issued by virtue of these documents.
*   **Purported Withdrawal of Civil Case No. C-474:** GAUF's argument about Bajamonde's purported withdrawal of his complaint is raised belatedly.
*   **Nature of Civil Case No. C-760:** While initially for specific performance, the Court found that GAUF, by intervening and relying on the "Kasunduan," effectively made the validity of its title an issue in that case.

**Analysis:**

The Court found that GAUF's TCT was based on a forged and nullified Compromise Agreement, which stripped the title of its indefeasibility.  GAUF's voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the trial court in Civil Case No. C-760, and its use of the "Kasunduan" within that case, prevented it from later claiming the RTC lacked jurisdiction. The Court effectively held that because GAUF's title's origin was tainted with fraud, a collateral attack argument was not viable. The Court also noted GAUF's failure to appeal earlier orders and its attempt to raise new factual issues on appeal.  The case confirms that a title obtained through fraudulent means is not indefeasible and can be challenged even in proceedings not directly aimed at its cancellation.
