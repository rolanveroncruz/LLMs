Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision (G.R. No. 117384), formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Heirs of Teodoro Dela Cruz vs. Court of Appeals, Pacifico Marquez, Filomeno and Gregorio Madrid*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Citation:** 358 Phil. 652 (1998)

**Facts:**

*   Petitioners (Heirs of Dela Cruz) filed for reconveyance of land in Isabela, claiming their predecessor bought it from the Madrid brothers in 1959.
*   Petitioners had been in possession since 1959, building improvements.
*   Respondents (Madrid brothers and Marquez) obtained Torrens Titles in 1986. Madrids deny the sale. Marquez claims he is a buyer in good faith and for value.
*   Petitioners offered a photocopy of a carbon copy of the Deed of Sale (Exhibit "A") as evidence, as the original was lost.

**Lower Court Rulings:**

*   **RTC:** Dismissed the complaint, ruling Exhibit "A" inadmissible as secondary evidence was improperly admitted.
*   **CA:** Affirmed the RTC's decision. Ruled Exhibit "A" was admissible due to lack of timely objection but had no probative value to prove the sale.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

*   **Reversed** the Court of Appeals' decision and declared the Heirs of Dela Cruz the lawful owners.

**Key Provisions/Arguments:**

*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The Supreme Court reiterated the Best Evidence Rule, noting that all original copies of a document must be accounted for before secondary evidence is admissible (*Ong Ching Po v. Court of Appeals, 239 SCRA 341 (1994)*). Even though Exhibit "A" (photocopy) was admitted due to the Respondents' failure to object when offered, the Supreme Court agreed with the CA that is lacked significant probative value.
*   **Probative Value vs. Admissibility:** The Court clarified the distinction between admissibility and probative value. While admitted, Exhibit "A" was deemed unreliable due to its poor quality and unsubstantiated contents.
*   **Laches:** Despite the registered Torrens Titles of the Respondents, the Supreme Court invoked the doctrine of laches. The Madrid brothers' inaction for almost 30 years while the petitioners openly possessed and improved the land barred their recovery (*Miguel v. Catalino, 26 SCRA 236 (1968); Pabalete v. Echarri, 37 SCRA 518 (1971)*).  The delay prejudiced the petitioners who invested in the land.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser:** The Court found Pacifico Marquez *not* to be a purchaser in good faith, given his knowledge of the petitioners' possession since 1959 (*Uy v. Court of Appeals, 246 SCRA 703 (1995)*). His failure to investigate petitionersâ€™ claim negated his defense.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   Respondents (Madrids and Marquez) are obligated to recognize the petitioners' ownership and relinquish any claims to the land.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **None.** The case has been decided in favor of the Petitioners.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Best Evidence Rule:** (Implied from discussion of admissibility of Exhibit "A").
*   **Torrens System:** (Discussed but ultimately subordinated to the doctrine of laches).
*   *Ong Ching Po v. Court of Appeals, 239 SCRA 341 (1994)* (Secondary Evidence Rule).
*   *Miguel v. Catalino, 26 SCRA 236 (1968)* (Doctrine of Laches).
*   *Pabalete v. Echarri, 37 SCRA 518 (1971)* (Doctrine of Laches).
*   *Uy v. Court of Appeals, 246 SCRA 703 (1995)* (Good Faith Purchaser).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The admissibility of Exhibit "A" initially appeared contentious but was resolved by deeming it admissible due to a procedural waiver by the respondents, but not dispositive due to its lack of probative value. The ultimate decision rested on laches, rendering the evidentiary issue less significant.
