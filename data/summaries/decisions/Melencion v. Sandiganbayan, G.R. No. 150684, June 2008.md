Okay, here's a legal summary of *Melencion v. Sandiganbayan* (G.R. No. 150684, June 12, 2008), formatted for a lawyer:

**Case Summary: *Melencion v. Sandiganbayan***

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing Sandiganbayan's resolution returning a case to the Court of Appeals (CA) due to improper venue for appeal.

**Facts:**

*   Andres Melencion, School Superintendent, was charged with violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) for allegedly withholding salary adjustments from teachers.
*   RTC found Melencion guilty.
*   Melencion filed a Notice of Appeal to the CA, *not* the Sandiganbayan.
*   CA initially sought OSG comment on transferring the case to Sandiganbayan, then transferred the records.
*   Sandiganbayan *returned* the records to the CA, citing the rule that an appeal erroneously taken to the wrong court shall be dismissed outright.
*   Melencion argued that the return of the records was invalid and that he was deprived of due process because the trial judge did not resolve his Motion of Inhibition.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:**  The core issue is whether the CA correctly transferred the appeal to the Sandiganbayan.  RA 8249, which took effect *before* Melencion filed his Appellant's Brief, explicitly grants the Sandiganbayan *exclusive appellate jurisdiction* over final judgments of RTCs in cases like this.
* Section 4(c) paragraph 3 RA 8249: The Sandiganbayan shall exercise exclusive appellate jurisdiction over final judgments, resolutions or orders of regional trial courts whether in the exercise of their own original jurisdiction or of their appellate jurisdiction as herein provided.
*   **Erroneous Appeal:** The Court cites Section 2, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, stating that if an appeal is erroneously taken to the CA, it shall *not* be transferred, but *dismissed*. This position is supported by Supreme Court Circular 2-90 and the cases *Murillo v. Consul* (183 SCRA XI), *Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation vs. Court of Appeals* (201 SCRA 51) and *PNB/NIDC vs. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 128661 promulgated on August 8, 2000)
*   **Timeliness of Correction:** While *Moll v. Buban* (436 Phil. 627 (2002)) allows for correcting an error in designating the appellate court, this correction *must* be made within the 15-day appeal period, which was not the case here. The trial court promulgated its decision on 8 July 1998. Melencion filed his notice of appeal on the same day. The Court of Appeals issued a resolution declaring its lack of jurisdiction on 30 May 2001.
* Section 18, Rule 124 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure: Application of certain rules in civil to criminal cases. -- The provisions of Rule 46 to 56 relating to procedure in the Court of Appeals in original as well as appealed civil cases shall, insofar as they are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rule, be applied to criminal cases.
*   **Due Process/Inhibition:** Melencion's claim of bias due to the trial judge's familial relationship with a complainant is rendered moot because of his jurisdictional error. He did not bring the appeal to the correct venue, so this argument failed. The fact that Mrs. Emma T. Pableo (Mrs. Pableo), one of the complainants, is Judge Suerte's niece. Mrs. Pableo's mother is a first degree cousin of Judge Suerte.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court *denied* Melencion's petition and *affirmed* the Sandiganbayan's resolution returning the case to the CA.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Procedural Error:** Melencion's fatal procedural error in appealing to the wrong court resulted in the dismissal of his appeal.
*   **Affirmation of Conviction:** By failing to properly appeal, the RTC's conviction of Melencion for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 stands.

**Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity revolves around the CA's initial handling of the appeal. While ultimately corrected, the CA's initial attempt to transfer the case to the Sandiganbayan, rather than dismissing it outright, is notable. This suggests potential confusion regarding the application of RA 8249.

**Potential Arguments:**

*   Arguing substantial justice to justify a relaxation of the rules is unlikely to succeed, given the clear jurisdictional mandate of the Sandiganbayan under RA 8249 and Melencion's failure to correct the error within the prescribed timeframe.
*   While challenging the RTC judge's impartiality due to family ties could be a valid claim, its success is contingent on a properly filed appeal in the correct venue.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the critical importance of adhering to jurisdictional rules. Melencion's procedural misstep ultimately doomed his appeal, regardless of the merits of his case.
