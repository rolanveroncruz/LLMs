Here's a concise legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *Spouses Christopher and Carmen Nuñez v. Dr. Henry Daz*, G.R. No. 246489, January 29, 2024.

**Issue:** Whether the Court of Appeals (CA) erred in reversing the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) award of damages (moral, exemplary, and actual) to the petitioners after the RTC acquitted Dr. Daz of Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision, denying the petition.  The SC held that the CA did not err in deleting the damage award.

**Key Provisions and Legal Reasoning:**

*   **Acquittal & Civil Liability:** The SC reiterated the distinction between two types of acquittal regarding civil liability. (1) Acquittal because the accused is *not the author* of the act or omission complained of eliminates civil liability arising from that delict. (2) Acquittal based on *reasonable doubt* allows for civil liability to be proven by preponderance of evidence. *Manantan v. Court of Appeals*, 403 Phil. 298 (2001); *Daluraya v. Oliva*, 749 Phil. 531 (2014).
*   **Finding of Fact:** The RTC's finding, affirmed by the CA, was that the prosecution *failed to prove* Dr. Daz was responsible for the hot water bag rupturing, or even that a hot water bag ruptured at all. This falls under the first type of acquittal which eliminates civil liability.
*   **Erroneous RTC Reasoning:** The SC found the RTC’s reasoning for awarding damages, despite the acquittal, lacked both factual and legal bases. The RTC misapplied the standard of proof (preponderance of evidence).
*   **Res Ipsa Loquitur:**  The SC rejected the application of *res ipsa loquitur* because the petitioners failed to demonstrate the elements. The Court pointed out several nurses where present and could be responsible. The SC held that it cannot be assumed the Dr. Daz was responsible for the bursting of the water bag. The facts also requires expert testimony regarding the process for administering the water bag. *Dr. Solidum v. People*, 728 Phil. 579 (2014); *Borromeo v. Family Care Hospital, Inc.*, 779 Phil. 1 (2016).
*   **Culpa Aquiliana & Contractual:** The SC rejected claims of civil liability based on *culpa aquiliana* (quasi-delict, Art. 2176, Civil Code) due to a lack of proven negligence and causation and rejected claims of contractual liability as quasi-delict presupposes there be no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   The case clarifies the scope of civil liability after a criminal acquittal based on the determination of the *source* of acquittal.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The decision reinforces the need for clear evidentiary links between alleged negligence and damages in medical malpractice cases, making it harder for plaintiffs to recover damages after an acquittal.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Sec. 7 (Double Jeopardy)
*   Civil Code, Art. 2176 (Quasi-Delict)
*   *Manantan v. Court of Appeals*, 403 Phil. 298 (2001).
*   *Daluraya v. Oliva*, 749 Phil. 531 (2014).
*   *Dr. Solidum v. People*, 728 Phil. 579 (2014).
*   *Borromeo v. Family Care Hospital, Inc.*, 779 Phil. 1 (2016).

**In summary,** the SC affirmed the CA's decision to set aside the RTC ruling regarding the damages because the acquittal was based on the lack of proof that Dr. Daz was the author of the act complained of. This finding extinguished the civil liability that arose from the criminal charge. The Court also clarified that even under the lens of a reasonable doubt, the facts did not rise to negligence under a preponderance of evidence standard.
