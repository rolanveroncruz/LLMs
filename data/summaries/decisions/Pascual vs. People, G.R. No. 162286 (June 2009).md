**Case:** *Glen Pascual y Malumay alias "Yeye" and Paulito Pascual y Judalena alias "Boyet" vs. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 162286, June 05, 2009)

**Summary:** This is a petition for review on certiorari seeking to reinstate the petitioners' appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA) which was dismissed for failure to file their appellant's brief.  The RTC convicted the petitioners of Homicide. The CA dismissed their appeal due to non-filing of brief. Petitioners argue that the negligence of their counsel should not prejudice their right to appeal. The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition, ruling that clients are bound by the actions of their counsel, even negligent ones, unless the negligence is so gross as to deny them due process and *provided the client is not also negligent*.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Obligation to File Appellant's Brief:**  Petitioners, as appellants, had the obligation to file an appellant's brief within the prescribed period. *Section 8, Rule 124 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure* allows the CA to dismiss an appeal if the appellant fails to file a brief.
*   **Client's Responsibility to Monitor Case:** The SC emphasizes the client's duty to be vigilant and monitor the status of their case and maintain contact with their counsel.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Binding Effect of Counsel's Actions:** Petitioners are bound by the negligence of their counsel, leading to the dismissal of their appeal and affirmation of their homicide conviction.
*   **Affirmation of RTC Judgment:** The CA's dismissal, affirmed by the Supreme Court, results in the execution of the RTC judgment, including imprisonment and the civil liabilities of P50,000 for death, P50,000 for burial expenses and P50,000 for moral damages, jointly and severally.
*   **Risk of Being Penalized for Counsel's Negligence:** Unless extreme circumstances are proven by the petitioner it is impossible to have counsel's actions considered as a form of gross negligence in their defense.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **General Rule: Client Bound by Counsel's Negligence:**  *People v. Salido*, *Barangay 24 of Legazpi City v. Imperial*, *Gacutana-Fraile v. Domingo*, *Sapad v. Court of Appeals*, *Macapagal v. Court of Appeals*, and *Villanueva v. People* support the general principle that clients are bound by their counsel's actions.
*   **Exception: Egregious Negligence:** *People of the Philippines and Bricio Ygana v. Rafael Bitanga* sets out the exception where the negligence of counsel is so egregious that it prejudices the client's interests and denies them their day in court. However, this negligence cannot be coupled with the client's own negligence. *Mario S. Mariveles v. Court of Appeals* provides an example where counsel's great negligence prejudiced the rights of the accused.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** governs petitions for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Rule 124, Section 8, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** governs the dismissal of appeals for failure to file appellant's brief.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Defining "Egregious Negligence":** The line between ordinary and egregious negligence is fact-specific and subject to interpretation. The SC found no gross negligence since the petitioners could have remedied their situation.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Difficulty Overcoming the Binding Counsel Rule:**  It will be difficult to argue for an exception to the rule that clients are bound by counsel's actions. Evidence of the client's diligence in monitoring the case and confronting the lawyer regarding the failure to file the brief will be crucial.
*   **Procedural Hurdles:** The SC emphasized the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules and deadlines, including the requirement to state the date of receipt of the CA resolution.
