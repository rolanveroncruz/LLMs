**Case Summary: *Salvador Chua and Violeta Chua vs. Rodrigo Timan, Ma. Lynn Timan and Lydia Timan*, G.R. No. 170452, August 13, 2008**

**Facts:** The Chua's (Petitioners) granted loans to the Timan's (Respondents) evidenced by promissory notes stipulating interest rates of 7% and later 5% per month. The Timan's initially paid these rates but later offered a manager's check for the principal, which the Chua's refused. The Timan's then consigned the principal amount and filed suit. The lower courts found the interest rates unconscionable and ordered the Chua's to refund excess interest payments.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loans:** Multiple loans were issued, evidenced by promissory notes.
*   **Interest Rate:** Initially 7% per month, then reduced to 5% per month.
*   **Payment:** The Timan's attempted to pay the principal through a manager's check and later consigned the amount.
*   **Refund Obligation:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision requiring the Chua's to refund interest payments exceeding 1% per month (12% per annum).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Excess Interest Refund:** The Chua's are liable to refund all interest collected exceeding 12% per annum.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Unconscionable Interest:** The central issue is the finding that 7% and 5% monthly interest rates are unconscionable despite the removal of usury law ceilings by Central Bank (C.B.) Circular No. 905-82. This presents a risk as lenders may find their contracts challenged if courts deem the rates excessive. The decision hinges on "contra bonos mores."
*   **In Pari Delicto:** The Chua's argued the Timan's were *in pari delicto*, but this was rejected as it was raised for the first time on appeal. This highlights the risk of failing to raise defenses at the trial court level.
*   **Good Faith Defense:** The Chua's also raised a good faith defense, but it was also rejected as it was a question of fact.
*   **C.B. Circular No. 905-82**: The court held that the Circular did not grant lenders *carte blanche* to raise interest rates to unconscionable levels, underscoring that the removal of interest ceilings does not authorize abusive lending practices.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **C.B. Circular No. 905-82:** This Circular removed interest rate ceilings. The Court notes that the Circular does not authorize unconscionable interest rates.
*   **Usury Law:** Suspended by C.B. Circular No. 905-82, but the Court still considers interest rates that are “contrary to morals ("contra bonos mores")”.
*   **Medel v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 131622, November 27, 1998, 299 SCRA 481):** Cited by the Respondents to support the argument that the interest rates were iniquitous, unconscionable, and exorbitant.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Unconscionable":** The Court provides a definition of unconscionable but does not provide any more definite metrics. 
*   **Application of *Contra Bonos Mores*:** The subjective nature of "contrary to morals" introduces uncertainty, requiring case-by-case determination.

**Conclusion:** The document highlights the risk associated with setting high interest rates, even in the absence of usury laws. Lenders should exercise caution and consider judicial precedent when setting these rates.
