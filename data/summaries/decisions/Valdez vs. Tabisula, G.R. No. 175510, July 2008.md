## Legal Document Summary: Valdez v. Tabisula, G.R. No. 175510 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a Complaint for Specific Performance with Damages concerning an alleged road right-of-way easement.

**Parties:**

*   Petitioners: Spouses Victor and Jocelyn Valdez (represented by Virgilio Valdez) - Purchasers of the subject property.
*   Respondents: Spouses Francisco and Caridad Tabisula - Sellers of the subject property.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (January 11, 1993):** Conveyed a 200 sq.m. portion of a larger parcel of land to the Valdezes.  Contains the clause "they shall be provided a 2 ½ meters wide road right-of-way on the western side of their lot but which is not included in this sale."
*   **Alleged Easement:** Petitioners claim the deed granted them a 2 ½ meter wide road right-of-way on the western side of the respondent's property. Respondents deny that they agreed to provide petitioners an easement "on the western side of their lot"
*   **Specific Performance Claim:** Petitioners sought a court order compelling respondents to provide the easement and remove a concrete wall blocking the alleged easement.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Specific Performance Failure:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' denial of specific performance, concluding the deed did not create a valid easement. The clause regarding the right-of-way was deemed insufficiently definitive to establish a voluntary easement. The Court determined that the right-of-way was "not included in the sale" which meant parties would have to enter into a separate and distinct agreement for the purpose.
*   **No Legal Easement:**  Petitioners failed to establish the necessary preconditions under Articles 649 and 650 of the Civil Code for a compulsory easement of right of way (property surrounded by other immovables with no adequate outlet to a public highway; proper indemnity; isolation not due to owner's own acts; least prejudicial point; shortest distance). The Court noted that the petitioners had adequate access to two public roads through their other adjoining properties.
*   **Counterclaim Reversal:** The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts' award of damages (moral, exemplary, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses) to respondents, finding the claim for damages unsupported by evidence of bad faith or ill-motive on the part of the petitioners. The Court noted that respondents predicated their Counterclaim for damages on general allegations of sickness, humiliation and embarrassment, without establishing bad faith, fraud or ill-motive on petitioners' part. The Court also notes that respondents failure to appear before the Lupon barred them from filing a counterclaim.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 613, 619, 649, 650, 708, 709, 1358, 2208:** Relate to the definition, types, and requirements for establishing easements, the necessity of written instruments for real property transactions, and grounds for awarding damages and attorney's fees.
*   **Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, Article 199:** Outlines the penalty for refusal or failure to appear before the Lupon or Pangkat.
*   **Relevant jurisprudence:** *Dionisio, et al., v. Ortiz, et al., G.R. No. 95738, December 10, 1991*; *Francisco v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 63996, September 15, 1989*; *De la Cruz v. Ramiscal, G.R. No. 137882, February 4, 2005*; *Costabella Corp. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 80511, January 25, 1991*; *Diokno v. Rehabilitation Finance Corp., 91 Phil. 608*; *Audion Electric Co. v. NLRC, 367 Phil. 620, 635 (1999)*; *Francisco v. GSIS, G.R. No. L-18155, March 30, 1939.*

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The clause "they shall be provided a 2 ½ meters wide road right-of-way on the western side of their lot but which is not included in this sale" is the central contentious point. The court interpreted the "not included in this sale" portion as indicating an intent to create a separate agreement, rather than establish an easement through the deed itself. The court deemed the word "shall" as permissive.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Disputes:**  The lack of a clear easement agreement could lead to further disputes regarding access to the property.
*   **Property Value Impact:** Lack of a clear right-of-way could negatively impact the value of the Valdez property.
