## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Mat-An y Escad* (G.R. No. 215720)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals decision affirming with modifications the Regional Trial Court's Joint Judgment finding the accused-appellant, Oscar Mat-An y Escad, guilty of Slight Physical Injury (Art. 266, RPC) and Murder (Art. 248, RPC).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Murder Conviction Upheld:** SC affirmed the CA's finding that Oscar Mat-An y Escad is guilty of Murder for the death of Minda Babsa-ay, qualified by abuse of superior strength. The court highlighted the disparity in size, strength and weapon use between Oscar and the victim.
*   **Slight Physical Injury Conviction Upheld:**  SC affirmed the CA's finding that Oscar Mat-An y Escad is guilty of Slight Physical Injury for the injury to Anthonette Ewangan. The SC agreed that the prosecution did not establish intent to kill and the injury was superficial.
*   **Denial Defense Rejected:** The SC reiterated that denial is a weak defense and cannot outweigh positive testimony, especially considering Oscar's own admission that he could not recall the events.
*   **Intoxication Defense Rejected:** SC rejected the defense's attempt to mitigate liability based on intoxication.  The court noted that mere claim of blackout is insufficient. The accused needs to establish that he took alcohol prior to the commission of the crime.
*   **Monetary Awards:** The Court modified the monetary awards to conform with *People v. Jugueta* (G.R. No. 202124, 05 April 2016).

**Obligations:**

*   **Oscar Mat-An y Escad:**
    *   Serve the straight penalty of twenty (20) days of *arresto menor* for Slight Physical Injury.
    *   Pay actual damages of P929.00 and moral damages of P5,000.00 to the victim of the Slight Physical Injury.
    *   Serve the penalty of *reclusion perpetua* for Murder.
    *   Pay civil indemnity of P75,000.00, moral damages of P75,000.00, exemplary damages of P75,000.00, and actual damages of P83,763.00 to the heirs of Minda Babsa-ay.
*   **All monetary awards** shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the finality of this decision until their full payment.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:**  Guilty of Slight Physical Injury and Murder.
*   **Civil:** Liable for monetary damages, including actual, civil indemnity, moral, and exemplary damages, as detailed above.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:**  The decision hinges heavily on the credibility of witnesses, and the SC deferred to the lower courts' assessments. Future challenges could focus on re-evaluating witness testimonies based on newly discovered evidence.
*   **Alternative Circumstances:**  The defense's failure to adequately prove intoxication could be a point of contention.
*   **Further Appeals:**  The accused has the right to appeal the decision, which can be done through motion for reconsideration.
