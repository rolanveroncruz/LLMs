**Legal Document Summary: *Ready Form Incorporated v. Atty. Egmedio J. Castillon, Jr.* (A.C. No. 11774)**

**Case Overview:**

Ready Form, Inc. filed an administrative complaint against Atty. Castillon, alleging violations of Rules 1.01, 1.02, and 1.03 of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The complaint stemmed from Atty. Castillon's use of Ready Form's financial statements (not ITR) in a Petition for Blacklisting filed on behalf of his client, Eastland Printink Corporation, against Ready Form before the National Printing Office (NPO). Ready Form asserted Atty. Castillon unlawfully divulged confidential information (specifically details from the financial statement which would appear on an ITR) in violation of Sections 4 and 278 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), RA 8424.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Alleged Violation of Canon 1, Rules 1.01, 1.02, 1.03:**  Ready Form claimed Atty. Castillon's actions constituted dishonesty, deceit, and conduct unbecoming a lawyer, damaging the integrity of the legal profession.
*   **Violation of Sections 4 and 278 of NIRC (RA 8424):** The core claim was that Atty. Castillon unlawfully procured and divulged confidential information from Ready Form's ITR and used it in the Petition for Blacklisting. Note: the court finds that the financial statement rather than the ITR itself was used.
*   **Violation of Section 30.1 of the IRR of RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Initial argument made by Ready Form during filing of the Complaint-Affidavit. It alleges that the Bid and Awards Committee should apply a non-discretionary 'pass/fail' test to bidding documents and Atty. Castillon's action undermined this.
*   **Petition for Blacklisting:** Filed by Eastland, represented by Atty. Castillon, alleged Ready Form made false declarations in its financial statement and ITR.
*   **Attached Document:** Critical point - only Ready Form's audited financial statement, obtained from SEC, was attached.
*   **Ready Form's Argument:** While the ITR itself wasn't attached, Ready Form argued the financial statements (which contained detailed income information) information appears in the ITR, and therefore its disclosure constituted a violation of confidentiality.
*   **Atty. Castillon's Defense:** He categorically denied using or attaching Ready Form's ITR. He argued he used audited financial statements acquired from the SEC, which are public documents.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Attorney's Duty of Confidentiality (Canon 1):** Lawyers must hold client information in strict confidence. The accusation centered on the breach of confidentiality regarding financial information submitted to the government.
*   **Compliance with NIRC:**  The NIRC prohibits unlawful disclosure of taxpayer information. Ready Form argued Atty. Castillon violated these provisions by improperly using and disclosing ITR-related information.
*   **Duty to Verify Information:** Atty. Castillon, as counsel, had a duty to verify the factual basis of the Petition for Blacklisting.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Public vs. Confidential Information:**  The key issue was whether the information derived from the *audited financial statement* was considered confidential, given its availability at the SEC. *The court determined that it was not*.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Ready Form's case relied on circumstantial evidence. The court found this insufficient to overcome the evidence that the financial statements were public and the ITR itself was not disclosed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 8424 (NIRC), Sections 4 and 278:** Central to the complaint, these sections relate to the Commissioner's power to interpret tax laws and penalties for unlawful disclosure of taxpayer information.
*   **RA 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act):** Ready Form initially argued that Section 30.1 of its IRR was violated by the BAC but dropped this argument.
*   **Corporation Code, Section 141:**  Cited to establish that audited financial statements are required and filed with the SEC, making them publicly accessible.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 129, Sec. 1:** Judicial Notice

**Court Decision:**

The Supreme Court *dismissed* the complaint against Atty. Castillon.  The Court adopted the IBP's findings that Ready Form failed to prove Atty. Castillon had used or divulged *confidential* information (specifically, the ITR itself). The Court emphasized that the financial statements used by Atty. Castillon were publicly available through the SEC and that the financial statements were attached rather than the ITR, which was the document allegedly containing sensitive figures. Since the court determined that only the audited financial statement had been used, which it was not confidential, the court found that Att. Castillon did not violate the cited provisions of the NIRC, nor the Rules of Professional Responsibility.
