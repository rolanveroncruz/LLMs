## Legal Document Summary: *Almeda v. Asahi Glass Philippines, Inc.*

**Case:** *Randy Almeda, et al. v. Asahi Glass Philippines, Inc.* G.R. No. 177785, September 3, 2008.

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reversed the NLRC ruling of illegal dismissal against Asahi Glass and reinstated the Labor Arbiter's (LA) decision dismissing the complaint but ordering separation pay from San Sebastian Allied Services, Inc. (SSASI).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Core Dispute:** Whether petitioners were employees of Asahi Glass or SSASI. Pivotal to this is determining whether SSASI was a legitimate independent contractor or a labor-only contractor.
*   **Labor-Only Contracting vs. Legitimate Job Contracting (Art. 106-109, Labor Code; DOLE regulations):** The Court held that SSASI was a labor-only contractor because it lacked substantial capital/investment to conduct independent business, and the employees' (petitioners') tasks as glass cutters and a quality controller were directly related to Asahi Glass's primary business of glass manufacturing.
*   **Control Test:** The Court determined that Asahi Glass exercised control over the petitioners, as they worked on its premises, followed its work schedules, and were subject to its rules. This is a critical factor in establishing the employer-employee relationship. *See* [Manaya v. Alabang Country Club, Inc., G.R. No. 168988, 19 June 2007, 525 SCRA 140, 159].
*   **Regular Employment (Art. 280, Labor Code):**  The Court ruled that petitioners were regular employees of Asahi Glass, given that they had worked for the company for periods ranging from three to eleven years. The positions filled by petitioners were necessary in the usual business of Asahi Glass, therefore petitioners are considered regular employees and are entitled to security of tenure.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The Court found that petitioners were illegally dismissed because Asahi Glass, as their employer, failed to prove a just or authorized cause for dismissal. Terminating the contract with SSASI is not a valid cause for dismissal. Also there was no compliance to procedural due process requirements (notice and hearing).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **DOLE Certificate of Registration:** The certificate of registration of SSASI was only issued shortly after petitioners' dismissal, creating a strong inference that it was obtained solely to legitimize the existing arrangement. The court stressed that it could not be applied retroactively.
*   **DOLE Opinions:** Similarly, opinions from DOLE officials authorizing Asahi Glass to contract out services were issued *after* the termination, weakening their relevance in validating the legality of the prior contracting arrangement.
*   **Accreditation Agreement:**  The court dismissed the Accreditation Agreement, which stipulated that petitioners were employees of SSASI, on the basis that employers cannot evade their legal obligations merely through contractual declarations.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Asahi Glass:** Held jointly and severally liable with SSASI for illegal dismissal. Ordered to reinstate petitioners to their former positions and pay full backwages from December 2, 2002, up to the date of actual reinstatement.
*   **SSASI:**  Held jointly and severally liable with Asahi Glass for illegal dismissal. However, SSASI is primarily liable for the money judgment because as labor-only contractor is the agent of the true employer (Asahi Glass).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding Asahi Glass to be the true employer of the petitioners and holding them liable for illegal dismissal. The decision underscores the importance of the control test and the requirement of substantial capital/investment in determining legitimate job contracting. The belated acquisition of the DOLE Certificate of Registration and Opinions did not absolve Asahi Glass of its responsibilities as an employer. Backwages and reinstatement were ordered. A computation for the actual amount must be made by the Computation and Examination Unit of the NLRC.
