## Legal Document Summary: *Domingo v. Commission on Audit* (G.R. No. 112371, October 7, 1998)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 challenging COA Decision No. 93-308 disallowing petitioner Aida Domingo, Regional Director of DSWD Region V, from collecting commutable transportation allowance while assigned a government vehicle.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Disallowance of Transportation Allowance:** Section 28 of RA 6688 (General Appropriations Act of 1989), and similar provisions in GAAs of 1988, 1990, and 1991, explicitly state that transportation allowance shall not be granted to officials assigned a government vehicle or using government motor transportation, except as approved by the President.
*   **COA Circular No. 75-6:** Reinforces this prohibition, stating that officials receiving transportation allowance shall not use government vehicles maintained with appropriated funds (referencing P.D. 733).
*   **Definition of "Assigned":** The Supreme Court emphasizes that the law uses the term "assigned" and not "used." The court interprets "assign" to mean "to transfer (property) to another in trust" and asserts that had the legislative intent been that the transportation allowances would be subject to the days used, "use" would have been used instead of "assign."

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Obligation to Refund:** Petitioner is obligated to refund the disallowed transportation allowance of P48,600.00 (less the P1,600.00 already refunded).
*   **Liability for Improper Use of Funds:** The case highlights the risk of personal liability for government officials who disregard statutory prohibitions on allowances, especially when a government vehicle is assigned to their office.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Disallowances:** This case serves as precedent, posing a risk of similar disallowances for other government officials who receive both a government vehicle and a transportation allowance, even if the vehicle is technically assigned to their office and they allege they don't always use it.
*   **COA Audit Scrutiny:** This decision reinforces the COA's authority to disallow improper disbursement of public funds, especially concerning transportation allowances.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Section 28, RA 6688 (General Appropriations Act of 1989) and relevant sections of prior and subsequent GAAs:** Primary legal basis for disallowance.
*   **Presidential Decree 733:** Regulates the use of government vehicles.
*   **COA Circular No. 75-6:** Implements P.D. 733 and prohibits simultaneous use of government vehicles and transportation allowance claims.
*   **_Bustamante vs. Commissioner on Audit_ (216 SCRA 134):** Cited as a similar case where the Supreme Court disallowed transportation allowance for a government official already issued a government vehicle.
*   **_Ursua vs. Court of Appeals_ (256 SCRA 147):** Cites the presumption that the law favors avoidance of undesirable and unintended consequences.
*   **_Mustang Lumber Inc. vs. CA_ (257 SCRA 430):** States words and phrases should be given their plain and ordinary meaning.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Assigned to Office":** Although the court ruled that being "assigned to the office" is sufficient to trigger disallowance, a potential area for contention could be situations where the assignment is nominal or where access to the vehicle is severely restricted. The degree of control and access becomes critical.
*   **Presidential Approval Exception:** The "except as may be approved by the President of the Philippines" clause is a potential escape hatch, but requires documented presidential approval, which is often difficult to obtain.

**Conclusion:**

The *Domingo* case confirms the prohibition against government officials simultaneously receiving a government vehicle and claiming a commutable transportation allowance, as mandated by the General Appropriations Act and related issuances. The decision underscores the strict interpretation of the law and highlights the potential liability for unauthorized or improper use of public funds. The key issue is whether a vehicle is 'assigned' and available even if not consistently in use, rather than the actual frequency of use.
