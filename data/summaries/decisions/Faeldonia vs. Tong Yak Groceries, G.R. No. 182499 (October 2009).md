**Legal Document Summary: *Faeldonia v. Tong Yak Groceries* G.R. No. 182499**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision reversing the NLRC's finding of illegal dismissal.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Employment:** Concepcion Faeldonia, employed as a sales/stock clerk for 22 years at Tong Yak Groceries, suffered a work-related injury (nail in foot).
*   **Medical Assistance:** Respondents initially provided medical assistance, covering hospital bills.
*   **Alleged Dismissal:** Petitioner alleges she was dismissed due to her medical condition upon returning to work after recovery. She contends she was told she was no longer wanted and offered money to resign.
*   **Employer's Defense:** Respondents deny dismissal, claiming petitioner demanded separation pay and failed to provide certification from a *government* physician confirming unfitness to work.
*   **Conflicting Medical Certifications:** Petitioner submitted a certification from the company physician stating she was fit to work, contradicting employer's claims she sought separation due to health.
*   **Labor Arbiter Ruling:** No illegal dismissal; separation pay awarded under Art. 284 of the Labor Code despite the lack of dismissal.
*   **NLRC Ruling:** Reversed Labor Arbiter; found illegal dismissal due to lack of proof of abandonment and employer's failure to adhere to due process. Ordered reinstatement and backwages.
*   **CA Ruling:** Reversed the NLRC, reinstating the Labor Arbiter's decision.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** GRANTED petition; reversed CA and reinstated the NLRC.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Burden of Proof:** Employers have the burden to prove dismissal is for a just and valid cause. *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. v. Tiamson*
*   **Abandonment:** For abandonment to exist, employer must show unjustified absence AND a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship.
*   **Due Process (Twin Notice Rule):** Employers must provide two notices before termination: (1) notice of the offense and (2) notice of the decision to terminate. Failure to adhere to this process means dismissal is illegal. *Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Garcia*
*   **Nominal Damages:** For breach of due process, employer liable to pay nominal damages (P30,000.00).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Dispute:** Core issue hinges on factual determination of whether dismissal occurred and if it was justified.
*   **Evidence Weight:** The evidence presented by both parties and assessed according to the standard of substantial evidence is crucial. If doubt exists between the evidence presented by the employer and the employee, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the latter. *Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. v. Tiamson*
*   **Conflicting Medical Certifications:** The existence of conflicting medical certifications significantly weakens the employer's argument that the employee intended to abandon her job.
*   **Lack of Due Process:** Failure to provide the required notices under the Labor Code leaves employer vulnerable to liability even if a valid cause for dismissal arguably existed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 284:** Separation pay due to disease (invoked, then rejected).
*   **Labor Code, Art. 223 & 217**: Powers of the NLRC over the Labor Arbiter.
*   **Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, Inc. v. Tiamson (G.R. Nos. 164684-85):** Emphasizes employer's burden of proof in termination cases and the standard of "substantial evidence." Also mentioned the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the latter.
*   **Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Garcia (G.R. No. 159625):** Reinforces the "twin notice" requirement for procedural due process in termination.
*   **Macahilig v. National Labor Relations Commission (G.R. No. 158095):** Elements for proving "abandonment".
*   **Mobilia Products, Inc. v. Demecillo (G.R. No. 170669):** Nominal damages in termination cases.

**Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   The conflicting claims regarding the reason for the employee's absence and her fitness to return to work represent the main contentious area.
*   The employer's failure to provide due process further weakened their case.
