## Legal Document Summary: *Estreller v. Ysmael*, G.R. No. 170264

This case involves a *accion publiciana* (recovery of possession) filed by Luis Miguel Ysmael and Cristeta L. Santos-Alvarez (Respondents) against James Estreller, et al. (Petitioners) for a property in Quezon City. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling in favor of the Respondents.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Co-Ownership & Right to Sue:** Affirms that a co-owner (Ysmael) can file an action to recover co-owned property *without* joining all co-owners, as the suit is deemed to benefit all.  Cites Art. 487 of the Civil Code and *Wee v. De Castro* (G.R. No. 176405, August 20, 2008) reinforcing this principle and extending it to all actions for recovery of possession including accion interdictal, publiciana, and reivindicatoria.
*   **Real Party in Interest:** Both Respondents were deemed real parties in interest. Ysmael as a registered co-owner, and Alvarez as a buyer of a portion of the property, based on RTC Decision (Civil Case No. Q-8426), Deed of Absolute Sale, and Memorandum of Agreement with the Ysmael Heirs.
*   **Validity of Sale:** Lack of annotation of the Deed of Absolute Sale on the TCT does not invalidate the sale.  Cites Art. 1358 of the Civil Code.  The sale is binding between the parties.
*   **Protection under P.D. Nos. 2016 & 1517:** Petitioners are not entitled to protection against eviction under P.D. Nos. 2016 and 1517 (Urban Land Reform Laws) because they failed to prove they were "tenants" as defined in Sec. 3(f) of P.D. No. 1517. Their possession was considered by mere tolerance, and not under a valid lease agreement. Cites *Dimaculangan v. Casalla* (G.R. No. 156689, June 8, 2007).
*   **R.A. No. 7279 (UDHA):** Petitioners failed to prove qualification for coverage under the Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992.

**Obligations:**

*   Petitioners are obligated to vacate the property and peacefully surrender it to the Respondents.
*   Petitioners are obligated to pay Respondents P400.00 per month from the date of extrajudicial demand, exemplary damages of P20,000.00, attorney's fees and litigation expenses of P20,000.00, and the cost of the suit.

**Liabilities:**

*   Petitioners are liable for reasonable compensation for the use and possession of the property.
*   Petitioners are liable for exemplary damages and attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The issues raised by the Petitioners had already been decided by the lower courts, thus making the petition without merit and the decision can be subject to res judicata.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The Petitionersâ€™ claim of leasehold rights with the Magdalena Estate, and later with Alvarez, were unsubstantiated and therefore rejected by the Court.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Wee v. De Castro* (G.R. No. 176405, August 20, 2008) - Co-ownership and right to sue.
*   *Dimaculangan v. Casalla* (G.R. No. 156689, June 8, 2007) - Definition of "tenant" under P.D. 1517 & 2016.
*   *Agasen v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 115508, February 15, 2000)- Validity of sale despite lack of registration.
