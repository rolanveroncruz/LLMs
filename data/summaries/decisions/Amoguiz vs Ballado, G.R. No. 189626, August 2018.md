## Legal Document Summary: Amoguis v. Ballado and St. Joseph Realty, Ltd.

**Case:** Gregorio Amoguis Tito Amoguis, Petitioners, vs. Concepcion Ballado and Mary Grace Ballado Ledesma, and St. Joseph Realty, Ltd. Respondents. G.R. No. 189626, August 20, 2018.

**Nature of the Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court of the Philippines on a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, regarding a property dispute arising from rescission of contracts to sell.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contracts to Sell:** Francisco and Concepcion Ballado entered into contracts to sell (Contract Nos. 5(M) and 6(M)) with St. Joseph Realty, Ltd. for two lots, payable in installments. Contracts contain automatic rescission clause upon 3 consecutive missed payments.
*   **Default & Rescission:** The Ballado Spouses made payments until 1979. St. Joseph Realty's collector, Pinili, refused to receive payments. St. Joseph Realty later claimed rescission due to non-payment, sending notices to the lot addresses instead of the Ballado's residence.
*   **Sale to Amoguis Brothers:** St. Joseph Realty sold the lots to Epifanio Amoguis (father of Gregorio and Tito Amoguis) in 1987 and the Amoguis Brothers subsequently occupied the land and were issued titles.
*   **Ballado's Action:** The Ballado Spouses filed a complaint for damages, injunction, annulment of titles, and specific performance against St. Joseph Realty and the Amoguis Brothers in RTC.

**Procedural History:**

*   **RTC Decision:** Ruled in favor of the Ballado Spouses, ordering St. Joseph Realty to accept payment, execute deeds of sale, pay damages, declared the titles of the Amoguis Brothers null and void, and ordered St. Joseph Realty to refund the Amoguis Brothers.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed RTC decision with modification, upheld that certificates of title were nullified to Amoguises. Court of Appeals discussed at the outset the issue of jurisdiction and stated that HLURB has the exclusive original jurisdiction over the case.

**Issues:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Whether the RTC had jurisdiction over the subject matter given that it involves a real estate transaction governed by PD 957 and PD 1344, potentially vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the HLURB (formerly NHA).
2.  **Admissibility of Evidence:** Whether testimonial and documentary evidence not formally offered could be considered by the court.
3.  **Good Faith Purchaser:** Whether the Amoguis Brothers were purchasers in good faith.

**Held:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** While the HLURB had initial jurisdiction, the Amoguis Brothers are **estopped by laches** from raising the issue of the RTC's lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court applied the *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* doctrine, noting that the Amoguis Brothers actively participated in the RTC proceedings for many years without raising the jurisdictional issue.  The Court highlighted the unfairness of raising the issue late after years of litigation. The court stated the conditions for Tijam to apply: *(1) there was a statutory right in favor of the claimant; (2) the statutory right was not invoked; (3) an unreasonable length of time lapsed before the claimant raised the issue of jurisdiction; (4) the claimant actively participated in the case and sought affirmative relief from the court without jurisdiction; (5) the claimant knew or had constructive knowledge of which forum possesses subject matter jurisdiction; (6) irreparable damage will be caused to the other party who relied on the forum and the claimant's implicit waiver.*
2.  **Admissibility of Evidence:** The SC upheld the admissibility of the Ballado Spouses' testimonial evidence, as no timely objection was made. The Court emphasized that the rules of procedure and evidence are in place to ensure the smooth and speedy dispensation of cases. However, only the contracts to sell were considered as formally offered documentary evidence.
3.  **Good Faith Purchaser:**  The Amoguis Brothers were **not considered purchasers in good faith**. The Court reviewed the conflicting findings from the lower courts. Court determined that though they were informed of Francisco's claim to the properties only after their purchase, it is undisputed from the records that mango and chico trees were planted on the properties, and that they were cordoned off by barbed wires. St. Joseph Realty also informed them that there were previous buyers, who allegedly abandoned their purchase. This means, they had a duty to inquire further.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The application of the "estoppel by laches" doctrine in circumventing statutory jurisdiction is always a contentious area, as it potentially undermines the legal framework for dispute resolution. The doctrine should be applied judiciously and based on the specific facts of the case.
*   The conflicting findings of fact between the RTC and CA regarding the Amoguis Brothers' good faith could be subject to further debate.

**Obligations:**

*   St. Joseph Realty must receive P30,000.00 from the Ballado Spouses.
*   St. Joseph Realty must execute registrable deeds of sale in favor of Ballado Spouses.
*   St. Joseph Realty must pay moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and costs of the suit to the Ballado Spouses.
*   St. Joseph Realty must refund P108,930.00 to the Amoguis Brothers with interest.
*   Amoguis Brothers must remove improvements and deliver possession to Ballado Spouses after new certificates of title are issued.

**Liabilities:**

*   St. Joseph Realty is liable for damages to the Ballado Spouses.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding the Amoguis Brothers estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction due to laches and holding them to be not purchasers in good faith. The ruling highlights the importance of raising jurisdictional issues in a timely manner and conducting due diligence when purchasing property. This case further solidifies the conditions for the **Tijam v. Sibonghanoy** to apply in situations where a claimant raises issue on court jurisdiction.
