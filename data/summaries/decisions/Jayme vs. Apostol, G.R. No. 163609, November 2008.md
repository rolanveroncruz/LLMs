Here's a concise legal summary of the case, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Sps. Jayme v. Apostol, et al.* G.R. No. 163609, November 27, 2008 (592 Phil. 424)

**Facts:** A minor pedestrian (Jayme) died after being hit by a pick-up truck driven by Lozano, an employee of the Municipality of Koronadal, while Mayor Miguel was a passenger. The Jaymes sued Lozano, Apostol (registered owner), Simbulan (possessor), Mayor Miguel, the Municipality of Koronadal, and the insurer (First Integrated), seeking solidary liability.

**Issue:** Whether Mayor Miguel is vicariously liable for the negligent acts of the driver, Lozano.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that Mayor Miguel is *not* vicariously liable.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Vicarious Liability (Art. 2180 Civil Code):** The SC reiterated the doctrine of vicarious liability, stating that an employer is liable for the acts of their employees.
*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The critical issue was whether Mayor Miguel was Lozano's employer. Applying the four-fold test (selection, payment, control, dismissal), the court found the Municipality of Koronadal, and not Mayor Miguel, was the employer of Lozano. The driver was merely assigned to the Mayor during the time of the accident.
*   **Control:** Even assuming Mayor Miguel had authority to give instructions to Lozano, this doesn't establish an employer-employee relationship or control sufficient to impose vicarious liability. *Benson v. Sorrell, Soliman v. Tuazon*. Giving directions does not establish control over the vehicle's operation.
*   **Fellow Employee:** Negligence may not be imputed to a fellow employee merely by virtue of occupying the vehicle even when the individual may have the right to control the manner of the vehicle's operation.
*   **Municipality Immunity:** The Municipality of Koronadal, as an agency of the State performing governmental functions, is generally immune from suit. *Municipality of San Fernando, La Union v. Firme*.
*   **Liability Lies With:** Registered owner, negligent driver and the negligent driver's direct employer
*   **Handley v. Lombardi (Handley v. Lombardi 122 Cal. App. 22, 9 P. 2d 867 (1st Dist. 1932)):** A superior employee cannot be held liable for a subordinate employee's action, unless the superior employee cooperated in the act complained of, or directed or encouraged it.

**Liabilities:**

*   Lozano (negligent driver) is liable.
*   Apostol (registered owner) is liable.
*   The Municipality of Koronadal *would* be liable as the employer, but is immune from suit due to its governmental function.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary risk lies with the Municipality's immunity, leaving the petitioners without recourse against the party most directly responsible.
*   *   The argument could be made that Mayor Miguel had de facto control, but this was rejected by the court, focusing on the legal definition of the employer-employee relationship.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 2180 of the Civil Code (Vicarious Liability)

*   *Rhone-Poulenc Agrochemicals, Phil., Incorporated v. National Labor Relations Commission* (loaned employee)

*   *Soliman v. Tuazon* (instructions to security guards does not render client liable)
*   *Handley v. Lombardi* (subordinate employee's actions not imputed to superior employee)
*   *Municipality of San Fernando, La Union v. Firme* (immunity of local governments)
