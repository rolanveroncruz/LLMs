**Case Summary: Baltazar v. People and Bautista, G.R. No. 174016 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Order granting the Motion to Withdraw Information for Murder against Respondent Bautista.

**Facts:**

*   Erlinda Baltazar died after being hit by a car driven from the direction of Calumpit to Pulilan Public Market and Rolando Baltazar sustained injuries.
*   Witnesses claim the car reversed and ran over the victims before fleeing.
*   The car was traced to Bautista.
*   MTC initially recommended dismissal based on a nephew's admission of driving, recommending reckless imprudence charges.
*   The Provincial Prosecutor reversed, finding probable cause for Murder and filing an Information under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, alleging treachery and evident premeditation in running over Erlinda Baltazar.
*   RTC initially found probable cause for arrest.
*   The Department of Justice (DOJ), reversing the Provincial Prosecutor, found the incident to be an accident (exempting circumstance under Article 12(4) of the RPC) due to lack of malice or negligence, directing the withdrawal of the Information citing *United States vs. Tayongtong, 21 Phil. 476*.
*   The RTC granted the Motion to Withdraw Information, and the CA affirmed, stating the judge made an independent evaluation and did not solely rely on the DOJ resolution citing Ark Travel Express, Inc. vs. Abrogar, 410 SCRA 148, 158[2003]

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Art. 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines Murder and its penalties.
*   **Art. 12(4), Revised Penal Code:** Exempts from criminal liability those who commit acts by accident without fault or intention of causing it.
*   **Rule 112, Section 1, Revised Rules of Court:** Defines Preliminary Investigation and its purpose.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, Bautista faced Murder charges, potentially carrying severe penalties under the Revised Penal Code.
*   The resolution of the case hinged on the presence of *dolo* (malice) or *culpa* (negligence).

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Conflicting Witness Statements:** Initial statements did not mention intentional running over, which emerged later. This raises questions regarding credibility and potential manipulation of evidence.
*   **Admission of Joel Santos:** Nephew's admission of driving raises doubt about Bautista's direct culpability, but questions about coercion or covering up for Bautista are relevant.
*   **Independent Evaluation:** The CA stated that Judge Concepcion made an independent evaluation of the facts, but did not rely solely on the Secretary of Justice's Resolution.

**Case Law:**

*   **United States vs. Tayongtong, 21 Phil. 476:** Used by DOJ to support argument for accident and lack of criminal liability.
*   **Ark Travel Express, Inc. vs. Abrogar, 410 SCRA 148, 158[2003]:** Cited by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Crespo v. Mogul, G.R. No. L-53373, 30 June 1987, 151 SCRA 462, 471:** Reiterates the court's discretion over a case once filed, despite the prosecutor's control of the prosecution.
*   **Marcelo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 106695, 4 August 1994, 235 SCRA 39:** Trial court should make its own study and evaluation of the motion.
*   **Jimenez v. Jimenez, G.R. No. 158148, 30 June 2005, 462 SCRA 516, 528-529:** It is . . . imperative upon the fiscal or the judge as the case may be, to relieve the accused from the pain of going through a trial once it is ascertained that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prima facie case or that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 12(4) (Accident), Art. 248 (Murder), Art. 365 (Imprudence and Negligence).
*   **Revised Rules of Court:** Rule 112 (Preliminary Investigation).

**Legal Issues/Potential Arguments:**

*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Whether the RTC abused its discretion in granting the withdrawal of the Information, especially considering its initial finding of probable cause for arrest.
*   **Independent Evaluation:** Whether the RTC made a sufficient independent evaluation of the evidence before granting the withdrawal, or merely deferred to the DOJ's opinion.
*   **Probable Cause:** The sufficiency of evidence to establish probable cause for murder, particularly considering the conflicting witness statements and the nephew's admission. The court found there was no probable cause for Armando C. Bautista to commit murder.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, finding no grave abuse of discretion by the RTC in allowing the withdrawal of the Murder Information against Bautista. The Court emphasized the judge's duty to independently assess the evidence and the DOJ Secretary's power to review prosecutorial findings.
