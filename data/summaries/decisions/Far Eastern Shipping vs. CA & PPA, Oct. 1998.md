## Legal Document Summary: *Far Eastern Shipping Company vs. Court of Appeals and Philippine Ports Authority*

**Case:** Consolidated petitions (G.R. No. 130068 & 130150) regarding liability for damages to a pier caused by the MV PAVLODAR while under compulsory pilotage.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Collision:** The MV PAVLODAR, owned by Far Eastern Shipping Company (FESC), collided with a pier in Manila, causing significant damage.
*   **Compulsory Pilotage:** The vessel was under compulsory pilotage at the time, with Captain Senen Gavino of the Manila Pilots Association (MPA) acting as pilot.
*   **Concurrent Negligence:** The court found both Captain Gavino and Captain Viktor Kavankov (master of the vessel) concurrently negligent.
*   **Damages:** The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) sought damages for the cost of pier repairs.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **FESC (Vessel Owner):** Held solidarily liable due to the negligence of the master, making the vessel unseaworthy due to the master's incompetence (Tug Ocean Prince case). The court cited American admiralty law that faults the vessel even if the pilot is compulsory and also noted that the master retains overall command and must act if the pilot is incompetent (The Steamship China vs. Walsh and The Oregon case). The owners are held responsible for failing to equip the vessel with modern machinery and ensure its safety. Also highlighted the doctrine of *res ipsa loquitur* (Republic vs. Luzon Stevedoring Corp.)
*   **Captain Gavino (Pilot):** Held liable for negligence in the conduct of docking maneuvers, demonstrating a lack of due diligence and adherence to required standards for pilots (Atlee vs. The Northwestern Union Packet Company case). Obligation exists to ensure directions were promptly and strictly followed.
*   **Captain Kavankov (Master):** Held liable for failing to countermand the pilot's orders or intervene when it became apparent the vessel was in danger (Jure vs. United Fruit Co. and The Emma T. Grimes case). The court underscored the master's ongoing duty to prevent accidents, including the failure to follow local government regulations (Hinman v. Moran Towing & Transportation Co., Inc., et al.).
*   **MPA (Pilots Association):** Held solidarily liable based on Customs Administrative Order No. 15-65 (CAO 15-65).  Liability limited to 75% of its prescribed reserve fund. The provisions of CAO 15-65 do not limit the liability of MPA to a small contribution to the reserve fund.
*   **Solidary Liability:**  All three parties (FESC, Gavino, MPA) are held solidarily liable for the damages, subject to MPA's limited liability per CAO 15-65.
*   The court also touched on liabilities between joint tortfeasors under Article 2194 of the Civil Code and highlighted the importance of each wrongdoer bearing the responsibility for their role in any injury or damage.

*   **Civil Code:** Articles 2176, 2180, 2194. Also cites Article 1207.

**Case Law References:**

*   **The Oregon, 158 U.S. 186:** Establishing presumption of fault against a moving vessel that strikes a stationary object. The moving vessel must show it was without fault or that the collision was a result of inevitable accident.
*   **The Steamship China vs. Louis Walsh, 74 U.S. 67:** Defining the master's duty to intervene in cases of pilot incapacity or danger.
*   **Jure vs. United Fruit Co., 6 F. (2d) 7:** Affirming the master's continuing authority and responsibility even with a compulsory pilot.
*   **Atlee vs. The Northwestern Union Packet Company, 22 Law Ed. 619:** Spells out the duties of a pilot.
*   **Tug Ocean Prince versus United States of America, 584 F. 2nd, page 1151** Regarding the incompetence of the navigator.
*   **Republic vs. Luzon Stevedoring Corp., 21 SCRA 279** Establishes the presumption that the ramming of the dock would not have occurred if proper care was used.
*   **City of Manila vs. Gambe, 6 Phil. 49 (1906):** Establishing pilot's liability for mistake.
*   **China Navigation Co., Ltd. vs. Vidal, 22 Phil. 121 (1912):** Establishes pilot's negligence when deviating from the ordinary and safe course.
*   **Yap Tico & Co. vs. Anderson, et al., 34 Phil. 626 (1916):** Exonerating pilot when his orders are disregarded.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Potential Risks:**

*   **Extent of MPA Liability:** While CAO 15-65 limits MPA's direct liability to 75% of its reserve fund, the document also states that this does not relieve the MPA from civil responsibility, potentially opening the door to further claims against the association or requiring the individual member to reimburse the association, as interpreted by the Solicitor General. The reserve fund can be used for the payment of damages referred to, incurred in the actual performance of pilots' duties, and the excess shall be paid from the personal funds of the member concerned.
*   **Concurrent Negligence:** The finding of concurrent negligence creates potential complications in apportioning blame and recovering damages.

**Procedural Irregularities:**

*   The Court reprimanded counsel for FESC for lack of candor and bad faith, and for deficiencies with their certification.
*   The Court also admonished counsel for PPA for filing many motions for extension and delaying proceedings.

**Overall Assessment:** The document suggests a strong likelihood that all three parties (FESC, Gavino, and MPA) will be held liable for the damages to the pier, although MPA's liability is capped. FESC's liability stems from the master's negligence and vessel unseaworthiness. The procedural issues reflect negatively on the parties involved and are noted to be addressed.
