**Case:** *Lawrence B. Wacnang v. Commission on Elections and Floydelia R. Diasen*, G.R. No. 178024, October 17, 2008.

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Certiorari assailing COMELEC Resolution No. 7911, which gave due course to Floydelia R. Diasen's COC as a substitute candidate for Governor after her husband's death. Petitioner Wacnang, the opposing candidate, argues Diasen's substitution was invalid because her deceased husband was an independent candidate who could not be substituted and because of issues with the validity of their Certificates of Nomination and Acceptance (CONA) from LAKAS-CMD.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Substitution of Candidate:** The core issue is the validity of Diasen's substitution of her deceased husband under the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), specifically Section 77, and COMELEC Resolution No. 7799. The petitioner argues that Rommel Diasen filed his COC as an independent candidate because he did not validly file his CONA at the time of filing his COC, rendering substitution impermissible.
*   **Validity of CONA:** The validity of both Rommel Diasen's and Floydelia Diasen's CONAs are contested. Petitioner points to inconsistencies (same notarial entries for Rommel's CONAs for two different positions on the same date) as evidence of spuriousness. This is a critical evidentiary challenge.
*   **Forum Shopping:** The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately dismissed the petition on the ground of forum shopping. The petitioner had also filed a petition for disqualification with the COMELEC (SPA No. 07-455) raising the same core issues of validity of the substitution and COCs. The SC held that these actions involved the same parties, the same rights asserted, and the same issues, despite different reliefs technically sought.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Obligation:** Wacnang had an obligation to disclose the pending disqualification case in his petition for certiorari, which he did, however, SC deemed it insufficient to negate forum shopping because it sought the same relief as the disqualification case.
*   **Comelec:** The COMELEC is under obligation to accurately determine qualification of candidates.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The case hinges on factual disputes about the timing and validity of the CONAs. The COMELEC's reversal of its initial decision (Resolution No. 7905) highlights the evidentiary challenges and potential for inconsistent findings.
*   **Comelec Discretion:** The COMELEC's ability to reverse its own rulings, especially close to an election, raises concerns about potential political influence and abuse of discretion.
*   **Impact of Election Results:** The SC's reference to the "overwhelming" election victory in favor of Diasen suggests a reluctance to overturn the popular mandate, even if legal issues exist.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC), Section 77:** Governs substitution of candidates.
*   **Rule 64 and 65 of the Rules of Court:** Petitions for Certiorari.
*   **Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure & Rule 46, Section 3:** Forum Shopping.
*   **COMELEC Resolution No. 7799:** Prescribes the deadline for filing COCs.
*   **Circular No. 28-91** on forum shopping for application to cases filed in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 04-94** in 1994 to include cases filed in all courts and agencies other than the Supreme Court.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The petitioner argues that COMELEC Resolution No. 7911 was issued with grave abuse of discretion. He claims that there was no valid CONA for Governor, that the subsequent substitution was invalid, and that private respondent could not be considered the party's substitute candidate.
*   **Respondent's Argument:** The private respondent argues that the COMELEC's Resolution No. 7911 was validly issued because Rommel was their party's official candidate for Governor, and a discrepancy in the numbers was clarified with an affidavit.

**Key Takeaway for Lawyer:**

This case serves as a clear warning against forum shopping. Even if technically different remedies are sought, duplicating issues across different tribunals can lead to dismissal. Strong focus should have been on the factual challenges to the CONAs.
