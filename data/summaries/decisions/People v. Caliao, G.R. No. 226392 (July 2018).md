**Case Summary: People v. Caliao, G.R. No. 226392 (2018)**

**Nature:** Automatic review of CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Murder. SC modifies to Homicide.

**Facts:** Accused-appellant, Nestor "Tony" Caliao, was charged with Murder for stabbing William Fuentes. Alleged motive stemmed from prior altercation and damage to the victim's property. Prosecution's version: Caliao suddenly stabbed Fuentes in a public market. Defense's version: Fuentes attacked Caliao with kerosene and a pipe, prompting Caliao to stab in self-defense. RTC found Caliao guilty of Murder. CA affirmed conviction but deleted evident premeditation as an aggravating circumstance.

**Holding:** SC found Caliao guilty of Homicide, not Murder.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Self-Defense:** Accused has the burden of proving self-defense with clear and convincing evidence (People v. Macaraig, G.R. No. 219848, 7 June 2017). Elements: unlawful aggression by the victim, reasonable necessity of means to repel, and lack of sufficient provocation.
*   **Treachery:** As a qualifying circumstance for murder, must be proven beyond reasonable doubt (People v. Umawid, 735 Phil. 737, 746 (2014)). Elements: employment of means giving victim no opportunity to defend, and deliberate adoption of that means. The attack was sudden and unexpected does not automatically qualify as treachery.
*   **Homicide:** Conviction resulted in a penalty within reclusion temporal to prision mayor. The Indeterminate Sentence Law was applied.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially liable for *reclusion perpetua* for Murder (RTC).
*   Modified to imprisonment for Homicide: eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*, as maximum.
*   Civil indemnity: P50,000.00
*   Moral damages: P50,000.00
*   Legal interest of 6% *per annum* on monetary awards from finality until fully paid (People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 846 (2016)).

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Defines Murder and Homicide.
*   **Rules of Evidence:** Burden of proof on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Exception: self-defense shifts the burden to the accused.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applied in determining the penalty for Homicide.
*   **People v. Macaraig, G.R. No. 219848, 7 June 2017:** On self defense.
*   **People v. Umawid, 735 Phil. 737, 746 (2014):** On treachery.
*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806, 846 (2016):** On the appropriate amount of damages and interest.
*   **People v. Vilbar, 680 Phil. 767, 786 (2012):** On the appreciation of the circumstance of treachery.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The conviction heavily relies on the assessment of witness credibility by the trial court. The defense argued bias of the victim's family.
*   **Treachery:** The main point of contention was the appreciation of treachery. The Court found that it was not sufficiently proven as the attack happened in a public place, and there was no showing that the accused planned the attack.

**Ambiguities:** The ambiguity lies in the interpretation of the events leading to the stabbing.
