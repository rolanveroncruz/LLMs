**Legal Document Summary: People v. Samson (G.R. No. 262579)**

**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Rossano Samson y Tiongco

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (affirming Court of Appeals, which affirmed Regional Trial Court)

**Decision Date:** February 28, 2024

**Key Holding:** Accused-appellant, Rossano Samson, found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for the killing of Abegail Tobias, an 11-year-old minor. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' conviction based on circumstantial evidence and the admissibility of Samson's extrajudicial confession.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Charge:** Murder under Art. 248 RPC, qualified by treachery and abuse of superior strength.

*   **Elements of Murder (Art. 248 RPC):** Proven by the prosecution: a) Abegail was killed; b) Samson killed her; c) killing was attended by a qualifying circumstance (treachery); and d) the killing was not parricide or infanticide.

*   **Treachery:** The Court held that treachery existed due to the victim's age and vulnerability. The killing of a child is inherently treacherous, as the child cannot offer effective resistance. This determination of treachery absorbs the alleged circumstance of abuse of superior strength. *Case law:* *People v. Enojo, 866 Phil. 835, 846–847 (2019), citing People v. Pantoja, 821 Phil. 1052, 1067 (2017)*.

*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The conviction was primarily based on circumstantial evidence, which the Court deemed sufficient to establish guilt. *Case law:* *People v. Matignas, 428 Phil. 834 (2002).* The key circumstances were:

    *   Accused's voluntary extrajudicial confession detailing the crime.
    *   Testimony of Atty. Villegas regarding the voluntariness of the confession.
    *   Accused was intoxicated before the body was discovered.
    *   Recovery of the victim's earring pendant and the murder weapon (crowbar) from the accused's house.
    *   Accused's flight to Navotas, indicating guilt.

*   **Extrajudicial Confession:** The Court ruled the confession was admissible because it was: a) voluntary, b) made with the assistance of competent and independent counsel (Atty. Villegas from the Public Attorney's Office), c) express, and d) in writing. The Court considered the circumstances surrounding the confession, finding that the accused was informed of his rights and understood the consequences of confessing. *Statutory reference: RA 7438*.

*   **Defense Arguments:** The Court rejected the accused's alibi and denial as weak and unsubstantiated.

**Obligations:**

*   Accused-appellant must serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.
*   Accused-appellant must pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   ₱75,000.00 as civil indemnity.
    *   ₱75,000.00 as moral damages.
    *   ₱75,000.00 as exemplary damages.
    *   ₱50,570.00 as actual damages.
*   All monetary awards are subject to a 6% per annum interest from the finality of the decision until fully paid.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Murder under Art. 248 RPC.
*   Civil liabilities as outlined in the monetary awards.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Admissibility of Confession:** While the Court found the confession admissible, a collateral attack arguing ineffective assistance of counsel or involuntariness could be attempted, though unlikely to succeed given the factual findings.
*   **Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court generally defers to the factual findings of the lower courts, making a reversal on factual grounds difficult.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Jugueta, 783 Phil. 806 (2016):** Used to determine the appropriate amounts for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **People v. Enojo, 866 Phil. 835, 846–847 (2019):** Reiterates that killing of a minor is considered treachery
*   **People v. Matignas, 428 Phil. 834 (2002):** Defines the standard for conviction based on circumstantial evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   While the court mentioned both treachery and abuse of superior strength, they clarified that abuse of superior strength is absorbed by treachery and should not be treated as a separate aggravating circumstance. This simplifies the legal analysis and eliminates potential ambiguity.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Art. 248:** Defines the crime of Murder.
*   **Republic Act No. 7438:** Defines the rights of persons under custodial investigation.
