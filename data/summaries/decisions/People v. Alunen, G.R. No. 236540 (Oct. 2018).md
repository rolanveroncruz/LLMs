## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Alunen & Laguelles*, G.R. No. 236540 (2018)

This Supreme Court decision reverses the CA and RTC convictions of accused-appellants Alunen and Laguelles for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 (sale of dangerous drugs).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Section 5, Article II, R.A. 9165 (sale of 10.21 grams of Methylamphetamine Hydrochloride).
*   **Acquittal Basis:** Failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, creating reasonable doubt.
*   **Chain of Custody Issue:** The prosecution failed to comply with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 regarding the post-seizure inventory and photograph of the seized items. Crucially, there was no representative from the DOJ and the media present during the inventory, and the prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for this non-compliance.
*   **Reliance on Case Law:** The decision emphasizes the need for strict compliance with the chain of custody rule to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs, citing *People v. Viterbo* (2014) on *corpus delicti* and *People v. Reyes et al*. (2018) regarding the need to justify non-compliance.
*   **Application of *People v. Lim* (2018):** While excusable non-compliance with the witness rule is permissible under the circumstances laid out in *People v. Lim* (2018), such as remote location or immediate threat, no such justification was demonstrated in this case.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The rigid application of the chain of custody rule, particularly the mandatory witness requirement, may hinder law enforcement efforts in future drug cases.
*   The "justifiable grounds" exception to the witness rule remains somewhat ambiguous, potentially leading to inconsistent application by lower courts. The lack of a sworn affidavit in this case regarding the steps taken to preserve integrity proves fatal.
*   The decision underscores the critical importance of meticulous documentation and adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases, failure of which can result in acquittal despite seemingly strong evidence.
