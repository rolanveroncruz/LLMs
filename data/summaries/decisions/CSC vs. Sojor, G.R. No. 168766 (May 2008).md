## Legal Document Summary: CSC vs. Sojor (G.R. No. 168766)

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of CA Decision annulling CSC Resolutions against respondent Henry A. Sojor, President of Central Visayas Polytechnic College (CVPC), later Negros Oriental State University (NORSU).

**Key Issue:** Does the Civil Service Commission (CSC) have jurisdiction over the president of a state university, or is that jurisdiction exclusively vested in the Board of Regents (BOR)? Does the assumption of jurisdiction by the CSC violate academic freedom?

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) **GRANTS** the petition, **REVERSES** the CA Decision, and **REINSTATES** the CSC Resolutions. The CSC possesses concurrent jurisdiction over the President of a state university.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Civil Service Commission Jurisdiction (Art. IX(B), Sec. 1, Constitution; Sec. 6, Administrative Code):** Grants the CSC administration over the entire civil service, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8292 (Higher Education Modernization Act):** Grants the Board of Trustees (BOT) general powers of administration and the power to remove faculty members, administrative officials, and employees "for cause."  Respondent was appointed under this Act.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9299 (NORSU Conversion Act):** Continues the powers of the BOR, mirroring R.A. 8292, granting the power to remove personnel "in addition to its general powers of administration."
*   **Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service:** Lays out the specific jurisdiction of the CSC and its regional offices.
*   **Section 4, R.A. 9299**: administration of the University and the exercise of its corporate powers shall be vested exclusively in the Board of Regents and the president of the University insofar as authorized by the Board.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent Henry A. Sojor, as a civil servant (even in a non-career position), is subject to disciplinary proceedings under CSC rules for allegations of nepotism, dishonesty, falsification of official documents, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Concurrent Jurisdiction:**  The Court affirms the CSC's concurrent jurisdiction with the BOR. While R.A. 9299 vests administrative power exclusively in the BOR (Sec. 4), this does not equate to *exclusive* disciplinary jurisdiction.
*   **Academic Freedom:** The Court rejects the argument that the CSC's jurisdiction infringes upon academic freedom, as the allegations involve violations of civil service rules, not core academic matters (e.g., curriculum, teaching methods).
*   **Condonation:** The SC rejects the claim that reappointment of the respondent served as a condonation of the alleged acts.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution (1987), Art. IX(B), Sec. 1:** Civil Service Commission mandate.
*   **Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 6 & Sec. 2:** Civil Service definition.
*   **R.A. No. 8292 & R.A. No. 9299:**  Governing legislation for the institution.
*   **P.D. 807 (Civil Service Law):** The Supreme Court cited this law and recognized that the Civil Service Law expressly vests in the Commission appellate jurisdiction in administrative disciplinary cases involving members of the Civil Service.
*   **University of the Philippines v. Regino (G.R. No. 88167):**  Reiterates concurrent jurisdiction, rejecting the argument that the UP BOR had exclusive disciplinary power.
*   **Camacho v. Gloria (G.R. No. 138862):**  Confirms that a case against a university official can be filed with the BOR or directly with the CSC.
*   **Salalima v. Guingona, Jr. and Aguinaldo v. Santos:** Distinguishes these cases, noting that the doctrine of condonation through re-election is inapplicable to appointed officials.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "exclusive" administrative power in R.A. 9299, Sec. 4, and whether it extends to exclusive disciplinary authority. The SC rules that it does not.

**Advice:**

This decision confirms the CSC's jurisdiction over state university presidents and establishes the concurrent nature of its disciplinary authority with the BOR.  A state university president facing administrative charges cannot rely on a lack of CSC jurisdiction or the defense of academic freedom to avoid investigation and potential sanctions.
