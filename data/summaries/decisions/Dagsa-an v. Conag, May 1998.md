**Legal Document Summary: *Dagsa-an v. Conag***

**Case:** *Dagsa-an v. Conag*, A.M. No. P-98-1269 (Phil. 1998)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Resolution regarding an administrative complaint.

**Parties:**

*   Complainant: Feliciana Dagsa-an
*   Respondent: Rodolfo Sel Conag, Clerk of Court, Municipal Trial Court, Palompon, Leyte

**Key Provisions and Allegations:**

*   Complainant alleged that Respondent failed to pay a debt of P17,400.00, obtained during an illicit relationship, which he used to purchase jewelry and accessories.
*   Respondent denied the accusation and alleged the complaint was instigated by Prosecutor Buot due to a prior complaint filed by Respondent.
*   Complainant formally withdrew her complaint under oath, stating lack of interest in pursuing the case.

**Court's Ruling and Rationale:**

*   The Supreme Court DISMISSED the administrative complaint for lack of evidence, primarily due to the withdrawal of the complainant.
*   The Court acknowledged that withdrawal of a complaint does not automatically warrant dismissal, citing *Vasquez vs. Malvar*, 85 SCRA 10. Administrative actions should not solely depend on the complainant's will.
*   However, the Court found that the case could not proceed without the complainant's active participation, referencing *Alegre vs. Nidea*, 64 SCRA 250, indicating a situation where dismissal is unavoidable.
*   The Court ADMONISHED Respondent for conduct unbecoming of a court officer for attempting to improperly obtain information about the complainant using the Court's letterhead.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent has a general obligation to act with circumspection befitting a court officer.
*   The Court implicitly retains the obligation to investigate and discipline erring members of the Judiciary, even in the face of a complainant's withdrawal.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondent avoids administrative sanction for the initial debt claim due to the withdrawal and lack of evidence.
*   However, Respondent incurs administrative admonishment for improper conduct in attempting to gather information about the complainant using official letterhead.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   The ruling highlights the tension between respecting a complainant's autonomy and the Court's duty to maintain judicial integrity.
*   The case implies that reliance on complainant cooperation to prove administrative cases makes disciplinary cases harder to proceed.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   *Vasquez vs. Malvar*, 85 SCRA 10: Reinforces the court's authority to discipline regardless of complainant's actions.
*   *Alegre vs. Nidea*, 64 SCRA 250: Addresses situations where dismissal becomes necessary due to lack of complainant participation.

**Conclusion:**

This case demonstrates that while complainant withdrawal can lead to dismissal due to lack of evidence, the Court still has the responsibility to uphold judicial standards. Even if the initial complaint is dismissed, the Court will punish any inappropriate action by a Court officer.
