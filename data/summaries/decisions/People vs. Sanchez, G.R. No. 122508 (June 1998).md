## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Sanchez*, G.R. No. 122508 (1998)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Elvis Sanchez for illegal recruitment in large scale (violation of Article 38(b) of P.D. No. 442, as amended) and three counts of estafa (Article 315, Revised Penal Code).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (Large Scale):** Defined under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code (P.D. 442) as acts of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring, or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, for a fee, without the necessary license or authority.  Specifically, the decision reiterates the three elements: (1) engagement in recruitment activities, (2) lack of license/authority, and (3) acts committed against three or more persons.
*   **Estafa:** Defined under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code as defrauding another by abuse of confidence or deceit, causing damage capable of pecuniary estimation. The court found the appellant had falsely assured the complainants jobs abroad and collected fees, resulting in financial damage.
*   **Penalty:** The trial court sentenced the accused to life imprisonment and a fine of P100,000 for illegal recruitment in large scale, and an indeterminate sentence of six (6) months and one (1) day of *prision correccional* as minimum to six (6) years, eight (8) months and twenty (20) days of *prision mayor* as maximum for each count of estafa.  The court also ordered restitution of the amounts defrauded.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant's Obligations:** Appellant was obligated not to engage in recruitment activities without the appropriate license or authority from the DOLE/POEA. He was also obligated not to deceive individuals into believing he could secure them employment abroad, resulting in financial loss to them.
*   **Appellant's Liabilities:** The appellant is liable for serving the sentences imposed by the court, paying the fine for illegal recruitment, and providing restitution to the victims of estafa.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Territorial Jurisdiction:** Appellant raised the defense that the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction, arguing he was not in Baguio City during the alleged recruitment. The Supreme Court rejected this defense, viewing it as a thinly veiled alibi and reiterating the trial court's findings based on the witnesses' credibility.
*   **"Inconsistencies" in Testimony:** Appellant challenged the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, pointing out inconsistencies in their descriptions of their relationships. The court dismissed these as minor and insignificant lapses in memory. The court underscored that, absent any nefarious motive, witnesses should be accorded credit.
* **Overlapping Penalties:** The appellant faced charges for both illegal recruitment and estafa for the same actions. The Supreme Court clarified this is permissible, as illegal recruitment is *malum prohibitum* while estafa is *malum in se*.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **P.D. No. 442 (Labor Code), Article 38(b) and Article 13(b):** Defines illegal recruitment and recruitment/placement activities.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 315:** Defines estafa.
*   **Act No. 4103 (Indeterminate Sentence Law), as amended:** Governs the imposition of indeterminate sentences.
*   **People v. Apongan, 270 SCRA 713:**  Regarding the weakness of alibi as a defense.
*   **People vs. Ma√±ozca, 269 SCRA 513:** Regarding the weakness of alibi as a defense.
*   **People vs. De Leon, 267 SCRA 644, 651; People vs. Benemerito, 264 SCRA 677:** Reiterates that creating an impression of ability to provide foreign employment through acts such as providing application requirements and collecting fees constitutes recruitment activity.
*   **People vs. Calonzo, 262 SCRA 534, reiterating People vs. Turda, 233 SCRA 702:** Reiterates that conviction under the Labor Code for illegal recruitment does not preclude conviction under other statues (e.g. the Revised Penal Code) such as estafa for the same actions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentencing based on the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and finding that the elements of both illegal recruitment and estafa were proven beyond reasonable doubt.  The defenses raised by the appellant (lack of territorial jurisdiction, inconsistencies in testimony, and alibi) were deemed insufficient to overturn the trial court's findings. This case reinforces the principle that illegal recruitment and estafa can be separately prosecuted even if they arise from the same set of facts.
