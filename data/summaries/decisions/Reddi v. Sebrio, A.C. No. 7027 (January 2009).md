**Case:** *Tanu Reddi v. Atty. Diosdado C. Sebrio, Jr.*, A.C. No. 7027, January 30, 2009 (597 Phil. 168).

**Summary:** The Supreme Court disbarred Atty. Sebrio for deceiving an American citizen, Tanu Reddi, into providing him with US$544,828 for purported real estate investments that were largely fraudulent. The Court upheld the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) recommendation, finding Sebrio violated the lawyer's oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions/Obligations Violated:**

*   **Canon 1, CPR:** Failure to uphold the law and respect legal processes.
*   **Rule 1.01, CPR:** Engaging in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct (offering properties for sale on misrepresentations of true ownership).
*   **Canon 16, CPR and Rule 16.01, CPR:** Failure to account for client's money and property.
*   **Rule 15.06, CPR:** Implying the ability to influence public officials (judges).
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court:** Deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in office.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:** Striking of name from the roll of attorneys.
*   **Financial:** Order to return US$544,828 to the complainant. Complainant is not precluded from pursuing other financial avenues to reclaim the rest of what she believes she is owed.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Amount Discrepancy:**  Complainant claimed US$3,000,000 but the Court only ordered the return of US$544,828, the amount Sebrio admitted to receiving.  The Court's decision may not be res judicata on a separate civil action for the larger amount, but it sets a precedent for the level of proof required.
*   **Lack of Accounting:** Sebrio's defense of using the money for various purposes (Las Piñas property, corporation set-up, Makati down payment) was deemed insufficient due to the lack of credible supporting documentation. The Court specifically criticized the unreliable nature of the handwritten acknowledgement of a partial payment, citing lack of corroborating testimony to support the legitimacy of the document.
*   **Retaining Lien Claim:** Sebrio's claim of a retaining lien over documents to justify non-disclosure was rejected as lacking credibility.
*   **Determination of Guilt Beyond Disbarment:** The IBP had originally suggested that Sebrio committed estafa and falsification. The Supreme Court, however, refrained from making a conclusive determination on the commission of those crimes. However, the Supreme Court did state that it was sufficiently established that Sebrio was dishonest and deceitful with the intended transactions.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Diaz v. People, G.R. No. 171121, 26 August 2008; Lee v. People, G.R. No. 157781, April 11, 2005, 455 SCRA 256:** Cited regarding the elements of misappropriation.
*   **Yu v. Palaña, A.C. No. 7747, July 14, 2008:**  Cited regarding the burden of proof when an attorney's integrity is challenged.
*   **Sps. Amador and Rosita Tejada v. Palaña, A.C. No. 7434, August 23, 2007, 530 SCRA 771, 772:**  Reinforces the need for demonstrating morality and integrity.
*   **Soriano v. Reyes, A.C. No. 4676, May 4, 2006, 489 SCRA 328, 330; Barrios v. Martinez, A.C. No. 4585, November 12, 2004, 442 SCRA 324, 325:**  Highlights the severity and caution required for disbarment.
*   **Dantes v. Dantes, A.C. No. 6486, September 22, 2004, 438 SCRA 582:** Emphasizes the importance of good moral character in the legal profession.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Art. 315** (reference to estafa, though not explicitly ruled upon by the Court).
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 138, Section 27:** Grounds for disbarment or suspension.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility** (Canons and Rules cited above).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** The largest point of contention is the difference between the amount claimed and the amount ordered to be returned. This raises the question of whether the Court found insufficient evidence for the full amount or whether it deliberately limited the order to the admitted amount.
