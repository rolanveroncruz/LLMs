**Case Summary: Geraldo v. The Bill Sender Corporation/Ms. Lourdes Ner Cando, G.R. No. 222219**

**Facts:** Reynaldo Geraldo (Petitioner) filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against The Bill Sender Corporation (Respondent Company) and its president, Lourdes Ner Cando (Respondent Cando). Petitioner was employed as a delivery/messenger man, paid on a "per-piece basis" for delivering bills for PLDT. He alleges termination without due process. The Respondent Company argues Petitioner was a piece-rate worker, not a full-time employee, and abandoned his job.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) partially granted the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals (CA) and reinstating the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) decision with a modification absolving Respondent Cando of personal liability.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Regular Employment:** The SC held that Petitioner was a regular employee of the company per Article 280 of the Labor Code, as his work was necessary and desirable to the Respondent Company's business, despite being paid on a per-piece basis. Even if not full time, over 14 years of service establishes regular employment. *Integrated Contractor and Plumbing Works, Inc. v. NLRC* was cited to determine regular employment by the connection between the employee's activity and the employer's usual business. Payment by the piece is not determinative of employee status (*Hacienda Leddy/Ricardo Gamboa, Jr. v. Villegas*).

*   **Illegal Dismissal:** The SC found the dismissal illegal because the Respondent Company failed to prove a just cause for termination or adherence to due process requirements (two-notice rule). Abandonment was not proven; mere absence is insufficient and the filing of an illegal dismissal complaint negates intent to abandon employment (*Padilla Machine Shop, et al. v. Javilgas*).

*   **Monetary Awards:** The SC upheld the award of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, attorney's fees, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave, due to the illegal dismissal and Respondent Company's failure to prove payment of benefits.

**Liabilities:**

*   **The Bill Sender Corporation:** Liable for separation pay, attorney's fees, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave.
*   **Lourdes Ner Cando:** Initially held liable by LA and NLRC but absolved by the SC of *personal liability* as there was no showing of malice or bad faith in the termination.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Piece-Rate vs. Regular Employment:** The initial dispute centered on the characterization of the employment relationship. The CA erred in focusing solely on the method of payment.
*   **Corporate Officer Liability:** While the general rule protects corporate officers, this case highlights that personal liability can attach if actions are done with malice or bad faith, or to perpetuate fraud (*Culili v. Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., et al.*). The burden of proving malice or bad faith falls on the complaining party.
*   **Abandonment:** Employer bears the burden of proving the deliberate refusal of the employee to return to work. Mere absence will not suffice.

**Statutory References:**

*   Article 277(b) of the Labor Code: Burden of proving just cause for dismissal rests on employer.
*   Article 280 of the Labor Code: Definition of a regular employee.
*   Article 97 of the Labor Code: Definition of "wage," including piece-rate pay.
*   Article 291 of the Labor Code: Prescriptive period for filing labor complaints (3 years).
*   Sections 2 and 5, Book V, Rule XIV of the Labor Code: Twin-notice requirement for dismissal.

*    *Culili v. Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc., et al.*, 657 Phil. 342 (2011)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**
The application of the "bad faith" exception to corporate officer liability is fact-specific and often contested.  This case clarifies that more than merely violating labor laws is required to establish bad faith sufficient to hold a corporate officer personally liable.  The CA ruling hinged on a misunderstanding of piece-rate worker vs. regular employee distinction.
