## Legal Document Summary: *Noel Guillermo y Basiliano v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 153287

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction for Homicide.

**Key Provision:** The case hinges on the Petitioner's claim of self-defense after admittedly stabbing the victim, Winnie Alon, three times, resulting in his death.

**Statutory Reference:** Article 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code, defining the elements of self-defense. Article 69, providing for a penalty lower by one or two degrees if the deed is not wholly excusable. Article 249, defining homicide and its corresponding penalty.

**Factual Background:** An altercation occurred in a restaurant between the victim and the Petitioner's companion, Arnaldo Socias. The Petitioner intervened. The victim then struck the Petitioner with a beer bottle. The Petitioner retaliated by stabbing the victim with a knife.

**Court's Ruling:** The Court denies the petition, finding incomplete self-defense.

**Elements of Self-Defense & Analysis:**
*   **Unlawful Aggression:** Found to be present. The victim initiated the physical aggression by striking the Petitioner with a beer bottle.
*   **Lack of Sufficient Provocation:** Found to be present. Petitioner did not provoke the aggression.
*   **Reasonable Necessity of the Means Employed to Prevent or Repel It:** Found to be absent. The Court determined that using a Batangas knife to inflict multiple stab wounds to vital areas (chest, neck, abdomen) was disproportionate to the threat posed by a person allegedly wielding a broken beer bottle, especially one who was intoxicated. Cited *People v. Escarlos*, G.R. No. 148912, for the principle of commensurate defense. Also cited *Sienes v. People*, G.R. No. 132925, noting the significance of the nature and number of wounds inflicted.

**Liabilities and Obligations:**
*   The Court imposed an indeterminate sentence of six (6) years of *prision correccional*, as minimum, to ten (10) years of *prision mayor*, as maximum, considering the presence of incomplete self-defense (privileged mitigating circumstance). This stems from Article 69 of the Revised Penal Code which mandates a penalty lower by one or two degrees.
*   Ordered the Petitioner to pay the heirs of Winnie Alon P50,000 as death indemnity and P50,000 as moral damages as mandated in homicide cases, referencing *People v. Tabuelog*, G.R. No. 178059, and *People v. Rodas*, G.R. No. 175881.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Subjectivity of "Reasonable Necessity":** The application of "reasonable necessity" is highly fact-dependent. The Court's assessment of proportionality could be challenged based on different interpretations of the threat level.
*   **Factual Discrepancies:** The Court emphasized the single contusion hematoma found on the Petitioner, contrasting it to the three stab wounds suffered by the victim. This highlights the risk of relying on the Petitioner's account without corroborating evidence.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The decision relies heavily on the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, a factor that appellate courts are generally hesitant to overturn.
*   **Moral Damages:** Although moral damages are generally awarded in homicide cases, the specific amount is often subject to debate and can be influenced by the circumstances of the case.

**Case Law References:**

*   *People v. Santillana*, G.R. No. 127815 - Onus of proof shifts to the accused when claiming self-defense.
*   *Senoja v. People*, G.R. No. 160341 - Distinguishes between complete and incomplete self-defense.

*   *Sienes v. People*, G.R. No. 132925 - Nature and number of wounds as indicia of self-defense.
*   *Chua v. People*, G.R. Nos. 150926 and 30 - Finality of lower court findings of fact.
*   *People v. Tabuelog*, G.R. No. 178059 and *Licyayo v. People*, G.R. No. 169425 - Re: Death indemnity.
*   *People v. Rodas*, G.R. No. 175881 - Moral damages in murder and homicide cases.

**Conclusion:** The Court upheld the conviction for homicide due to a lack of reasonable necessity in the means of defense, even though unlawful aggression and lack of provocation were present. The focus remains on the disproportionate use of force by the Petitioner.
