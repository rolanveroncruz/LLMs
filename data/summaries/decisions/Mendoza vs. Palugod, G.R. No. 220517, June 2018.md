## Legal Document Summary - G.R. No. 220517

**Case:** *Lolita Espiritu Santo Mendoza and SPS. Alexander and Elizabeth Gutierrez vs. SPS. Ramon, Sr. and Natividad Palugod*

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** June 20, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision denying petitioners' appeal and affirming RTC's ruling in favor of respondents.  The original action concerned a complaint for Declaration of Nullity of a Deed of Absolute Sale (DAS) and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (DAS):**  Jasminia Palugod (deceased) executed a DAS in favor of Lolita Mendoza (petitioner) for a property in Bacoor, Cavite, for Php 400,000.  Respondents (Jasminia's parents) alleged the sale was simulated and without consideration, intended to benefit Mendoza who allegedly depended on Jasminia.
*   **Deed of Real Estate Mortgage:**  Mendoza subsequently mortgaged the property to Sps. Gutierrez (petitioners) for Php 800,000.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Declared the DAS void for being simulated due to lack of consideration. Consequently, the mortgage was also declared void because Mendoza was not the rightful owner.  Ordered cancellation of Mendoza's title and reinstatement of Jasminia's title.  Awarded attorney's fees to respondents.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC Decision, finding respondents had proven by preponderance of evidence the simulation of the DAS.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Reversed RTC and CA, upheld validity of DAS, dismissing the complaint.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents' Allegation & Burden:** Respondents claimed lack of consideration for the DAS and bore the burden to prove it by preponderance of evidence (Rule 133, Sec. 1, Rules of Court).
*   **Petitioners' Position & Presumption:** Petitioners relied on the DAS itself, invoking the disputable presumption of sufficient consideration for contracts (Article 1354, Civil Code; Section 3(r), Rule 131, Rules of Court).

**Potential Risks & Liabilities:**

*   **Risk to Petitioners in Lower Courts:** The initial risk was the invalidation of the sale and mortgage, potentially leading to loss of property and loan security for Sps. Gutierrez. Also, facing Php 200,000 for attorney's fees.
*   **Risk to Respondents in Supreme Court:**  The risk of reversing the decisions of the RTC and CA and failing to prove cause of action by preponderance of evidence to rebut disputable presumption (Mangahas v. Brobio, 648 Phil. 560 (2010)).
*   **Liability of Sps. Gutierrez:** RTC and CA ruled that Sps. Gutierrez are jointly and severally liable for attorney's fees.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1354, Civil Code:** Presumption of consideration in contracts.
*   **Section 3(r), Rule 131, Rules of Court:** Disputable presumption of sufficient consideration for contracts.
*   **Section 1, Rule 133, Rules of Court:** Standard of preponderance of evidence in civil cases.
*   **Mangahas v. Brobio, 648 Phil. 560 (2010):**  Outlines how to overcome the presumption of sufficient consideration.
*   **Rivera v. CA, 348 Phil. 734 (1998):** Explains the burden of proof and equipoise of evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Issues:**

*   **Lack of Receipts:** The absence of receipts for the Php 400,000 payment was a major point of contention. The lower courts considered it as proof of lack of consideration. Supreme Court ruled sworn testimony can be proof.
*   **"No Payment in Presence of Notary Public" admission of Lolita:** Lower courts took Lolita's admission of not having paid during the signing of DAS to mean no payment ever transpired; The Supreme Court ruled such admission did not per se invalidate the transaction.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Conflicting testimonies of respondent Natividad and petitioner Lolita needed credibility assessment, with consideration of documents showing Lolita's ability to have afforded consideration.
*   **Alleged lesbian relationship:**  Mentioned by the respondent to show dependent relationship between the Lolita and Jasminia.

**Summary of Supreme Court Reversal**

The Supreme Court determined that lower courts misapprehended facts and failed to consider relevant evidence. Specifically, the Court emphasized the validity of presumption and that the burden of disproving consideration of the DAS lay upon the respondents, which respondents failed to accomplish based on insufficient contradictory testimony. The Court weighed testimonial credibility and acknowledged documentary evidence from Lolita to rebut respondent's claims. The court found that even if there was no sufficient evidence, the evidence was equipoise and, as such, the burden was unfulfilled and the action should be dismissed.
