## Legal Document Summary - Consulta v. People

**Case:** *Pedro C. Consulta v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 179462, February 12, 2009. (598 Phil. 464)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the RTC conviction for Robbery with Intimidation of Persons under Article 294, paragraph 5, in relation to Article 293 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Supreme Court modifies the ruling.

**Key Issue:** Whether the elements of Robbery with Intimidation of Persons were proven beyond reasonable doubt; and whether, even if unproven, a conviction for Grave Coercion is warranted.

**Summary:** The accused, Pedro Consulta, was initially charged with and convicted of Robbery with Intimidation for allegedly forcibly taking the complainant's necklace. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction for Robbery with Intimidation, finding that *animus lucrandi* (intent to gain), a necessary element of Robbery, was not sufficiently proven. The court found that the prior contentious relationship between the parties suggested an alternate motive other than pecuniary gain. However, the Supreme Court found Consulta guilty of Grave Coercion under Article 286 of the RPC. The Court reasoned that the elements of force, threats, and intimidation used by the accused to prevent the complainant from proceeding to her destination constituted Grave Coercion.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Robbery with Intimidation (Art. 293 & 294(5), RPC):** Requires (1) taking of personal property; (2) belonging to another; (3) with *animus lucrandi*; and (4) with violence or intimidation. The Court found the 3rd element missing.
*   **Grave Coercion (Art. 286, RPC):** Requires that a person, without authority of law, by means of violence, threats, or intimidation, prevents another from doing something not prohibited by law or compels them to do something against their will. The Court found this was met with the accused threatening the victim. The Court found that the accused employed the use of force, threats and intimidation, by verbally abusing, driving away the tricycle driver, and kicking the tricycle, ultimately preventing the victim from going to her destination.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Lower Court Ruling:** Convicted of Robbery with Intimidation and ordered to imprisonment from one (1) year, seven (7) months and eleven (11) days of arresto mayor, as minimum, to eight (8) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of prision mayor, as maximum and to pay P3,500 in damages.
*   **Final Supreme Court Ruling:** Convicted of Grave Coercion and sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of arresto mayor as minimum, to three (3) years and six (6) months of prision correccional medium as maximum, ordered to return the necklace or pay its value of P3,500, and costs de oficio.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Animus Lucrandi:** The court's assessment of the lack of *animus lucrandi* is central to the modified ruling. This relies on the interpretation of the accused's motives based on prior strained relations. This is often a difficult element to prove definitively.
*   **Variance of Offense:** The Court invoked Section 4 and 5 of Rule 120 of the Rules of Court on variance between the offense charged and the offense proved. This allows conviction for a lesser included offense or an offense that is proved even if not formally charged, provided the essential elements overlap. This power can be viewed as risky if it unduly prejudices the defendant by denying them fair notice.
*   **Validity of Prior Representation:** Appellant raised the issue of representation by a fake lawyer at the early stages of the trial. The Court found that this was harmless error since he was represented later by the Public Attorney's Office. This point could have been contentious if not properly handled, potentially voiding prior proceedings.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Elesterio (G.R. No. 63971, May 9, 1989, 173 SCRA 243):** Used to address the issue of representation by a non-lawyer, emphasizing that the accused later had competent counsel.
*   **People v. Reyes (G.R. 135682, March 26, 2003, 399 SCRA 528):** Cited on the definition and proof of *animus lucrandi*.
*   **United States v. Villa Abrille (36 Phil. 807, 809 (1917)):** Highlights the distinction between Robbery and Grave Coercion based on the accused's intent.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 286 (Grave Coercion), 293 (Definition of Robbery), 294(5) (Penalty for Robbery with Intimidation)
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 120, Section 4 & 5:** Regarding variance of offense.

**Ambiguities:** The subjective determination of the accused's intent is an area of potential ambiguity.
