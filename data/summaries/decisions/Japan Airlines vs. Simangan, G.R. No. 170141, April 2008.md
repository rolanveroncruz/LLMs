## Legal Document Summary: *Japan Airlines v. Simangan*, G.R. No. 170141 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision ordering JAL to pay damages to Simangan for breach of contract of carriage.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** Establishes that issuing a confirmed ticket creates a contract of carriage, obligating the airline to transport the passenger on the specified flight.
*   **Breach of Contract:** JAL breached this contract by refusing to allow Simangan to board despite a valid ticket and documents. JAL's justification of needing to authenticate the travel documents with the U.S. Embassy after allowing Simangan to board was deemed insufficient.
*   **Moral Damages:** Awarded due to JAL's bad faith in breaching the contract. This includes the humiliating and disrespectful manner in which Simangan was removed from the plane. Reference is made to Art. 2220 of the Civil Code.
*   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded due to the wanton, oppressive, and malevolent nature of JAL's actions, intended as a deterrent against similar behavior.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded due to the need to litigate to protect Simangan's interests. The Court found the CA's deletion of attorney's fees on the ground that the record is devoid of evidence to show the cost of the services of respondent's counsel erroneous and that the amount is discretionary upon the Court so long as it passes the test of reasonableness.
*   **Legal Interest:** Imposed on the awarded damages from the RTC judgment date, with an increased rate after finality of the decision (6% from RTC judgment date, increased to 12% upon finality).
*   **Counterclaim:** JAL's counterclaim for damages based on the allegedly malicious institution of the complaint and publication in newspapers was denied because Simangan's complaint was not deemed malicious or unfounded. Additionally, under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press, fair commentaries on matters of public interest are privileged and constitute a valid defense in an action for libel or slander. Therefore, JAL may not claim damages for them.

**Obligations:**

*   JAL had the obligation to transport Simangan as per the contract of carriage.
*   JAL had the obligation to treat its passengers with utmost diligence (Art. 1755, Civil Code).

**Liabilities:**

*   JAL is liable for moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and legal interest.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Bad Faith" Standard:** The determination of "bad faith" in breach of contract cases can be subjective. The court emphasizes the disrespectful and humiliating manner of the disembarkation as key evidence of bad faith.
*   **Amount of Damages:** While the CA reduced the initial amount of damages awarded by the RTC, the quantification of emotional distress and reputational harm remains inherently subjective.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Yu Eng Cho v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., G.R. No. 123560, March 27, 2000, 328 SCRA 717, 735:** Confirms that issuing a ticket constitutes a contract of carriage.
*   **Japan Airlines v. Asuncion, G.R. No. 161730, January 28, 2005, 449 SCRA 544, 548.:** The power to admit or not an alien into the country is a sovereign act which cannot be interfered with even by Japan Airlines.
*   **Ortigas, Jr. v. Lufthansa German Airlines, G.R. No. L-28773, June 30, 1975, 64 SCRA 610:** Inattention and lack of care on the part of the carrier resulting in the failure of the passenger to be accommodated in the class contracted for amounts to bad faith or fraud which entitles the passengers to the award of moral damages in accordance with Article 2220 of the Civil Code.
*   **Article 1755 of the Civil Code:** Common carriers must exercise utmost diligence.
*   **Article 2220 of the Civil Code:** Allows for moral damages in contract cases with fraud or bad faith.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Allows for attorney's fees in instances of breach of contract.
*   **Borjal v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126466, January 14, 1999, 301 SCRA 1:**  To reiterate, fair commentaries on matters of public interest are privileged and constitute a valid defense in an action for libel or slander.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision (with modifications regarding the amount of moral damages and the addition of attorney's fees), finding JAL liable for breaching its contract of carriage with Simangan due to bad faith and wanton actions. JAL failed to demonstrate any reversible error in the lower courts' findings and thus its claims cannot be substantiated. Simangan is entitled to moral and exemplary damages, legal interest, and attorney's fees. JAL's counterclaims were denied.
