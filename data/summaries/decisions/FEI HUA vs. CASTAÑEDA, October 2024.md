**Legal Document Summary: Fei Hua Finance and Leasing Service vs. Edilberto Castañeda (G.R. No. 272689)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that reversed the RTC's order rendering moot a motion to recall a writ of possession.

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Fei Hua Finance and Leasing Service (Fei Hua), mortgagee and purchaser at foreclosure sale.
*   **Respondent:** Edilberto Castañeda, purchaser of a parking space from Goldland Properties and Development Corporation (Goldland) prior to the mortgage.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Mortgage:** Goldland obtained a credit facility from Fei Hua secured by a Real Estate Mortgage over 60 parking spaces.
*   **Prior Sale:** Castañeda purchased one of the parking spaces (subject property) from Goldland prior to the mortgage, evidenced by a Reservation Agreement, Acknowledgment (both dated Sept. 28, 2013), and a Deed of Absolute Sale (Sept 12, 2018).
*   **Default and Foreclosure:** Goldland defaulted, Fei Hua extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage, and purchased the properties at public auction. Fei Hua consolidated the titles.
*   **Writ of Possession:** Fei Hua obtained an ex-parte writ of possession from the RTC.
*   **Castañeda's Motion:** Castañeda filed a motion to recall the writ of possession, claiming ownership and prior possession.
*   **RTC Ruling:** The RTC denied the motion as moot, because the writ was already executed, and found that the enforcement of the writ of possession would not violate Rules 16 and 33 of the Rules of Court. Relying on *China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Lozada*, the RTC held that Castañeda was merely a successor in interest and, as such, his possession could not be adverse to Goldland.
*   **CA Ruling:** The CA reversed, setting aside the RTC orders. The CA held Castañeda's possession was adverse, and relied on *Spouses Rosario v. Government Service Insurance System* which modified the rule disqualifying all transferees or successors of the judgment debtor from being considered as third-party adverse possessors.

**Issue:** Did the CA err in holding that the execution of the writ of possession did not render Castañeda's motion to recall moot?

**Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the Petition, affirming the CA's ruling. The execution of the writ of possession did not render Castañeda's motion moot.

**Key Rationale:**

*   **Proper Remedy:** Castañeda availed of the correct remedy when he filed a Rule 65 petition before the CA to challenge the assailed RTC Orders which in essence denied Castañeda's motion to recall the subject writ of possession as the same partakes of the nature of an order of execution which is interlocutory in character, thus, not appealable under Rule 41, Section 1 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Third-Party Adverse Possession:** The Court emphasized the exception to the ministerial duty to issue a writ of possession where a third party claims a right adverse to the mortgagor/debtor. It cited *Spouses Rosario v. GSIS* which held that condominium/subdivision lot buyers in actual possession should be excluded from the implementation of the writ.
*   **Castañeda's Evidence:** Castañeda presented substantial evidence of his prior purchase and possession, which Fei Hua failed to refute.
*   **HSAC Decision:** The Human Settlements Adjudication Commission (HSAC) ruled in Castañeda's favor, declaring the mortgage contract, the consequential mortgage foreclosure sale and issuance of a new title as null and void.
*   **Due Process:** The Court stated that Castañeda was denied due process, being unaware of the proceedings until after the writ's issuance. Void ab initio.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Fei Hua:** Required to respect Castañeda's ownership and possession rights. May be liable for further claims by Castañeda.
*   **Goldland:** Potentially liable to Fei Hua for the defaulted loan and to Castañeda for breach of contract and for the mortgage made without the consent of the buyer.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Scope of the *Spouses Rosario* Exception:** While the SC confirmed the exception for unit buyers in possession, future cases may test the boundaries of "actual possession" and "bona fide" purchaser status.
*   **Effect of HSAC Decision:** The HSAC decision declaring the mortgage void is a strong factor, but its finality and enforceability are subject to further legal challenges by Fei Hua, if any.
*   **Title Reinstatement:** The order to reinstate the original CCT will require coordination with the Registry of Deeds and may face practical hurdles.
*   **Further Litigation:** Fei Hua may pursue other legal avenues to challenge Castañeda's claim, although this decision significantly weakens their position.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutes:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 33:** Regarding possession upon expiration of the redemption period and exceptions for third-party adverse possessors.
*   ***Spouses Rosario v. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)*:** Modified the rule disqualifying all transferees or successors of the judgment debtor from being considered as third-party adverse possessors. Individual buyers of condominium units or subdivision lots, while having privity with developer-mortgagors, should be excluded from the issuance or implementation of a writ of possession if they are actually occupying the unit or lot
*   ***China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Lozada*:** Addressed the rule on excluding transfers of successors of the judgment debtor from being considered as third-party adverse possessors.

**Recommendations:**

*   Review the HSAC decision for finality and enforceability.
*   Coordinate with the Registry of Deeds for the title reinstatement.
*   Assess potential counterclaims against Goldland for breach of contract.
*   Anticipate potential future litigation from Fei Hua.
