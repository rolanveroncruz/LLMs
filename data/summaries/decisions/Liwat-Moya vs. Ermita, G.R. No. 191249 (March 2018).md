**Case:** *Corazon Liwat-Moya v. Executive Secretary Ermita and Rapid City Realty & Development Corporation* G.R. No. 191249, March 14, 2018

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the denial of Corazon Liwat-Moya's application for a Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA) because she failed to comply with mandatory requirements and deadlines established by law and regulations.  The Court emphasized the importance of strict compliance with mining laws to ensure responsible and efficient development of mineral resources.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **R.A. No. 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995) and Implementing Rules:**  Grants preferential rights to holders of valid and existing mining claims/applications pending when the law took effect, subject to compliance with specific requirements.
*   **DENR Memorandum Order (DMO) No. 97-07:** Mandates specific deadlines (September 15, 1997 and October 30, 1997) for pending MPSA applicants to submit a status report, letter of intent, and all lacking mandatory requirements. Failure to comply leads to denial of the application.
*   **DAO No. 96-40, Section 273**: Failure to exercise preferential rights within the set period constitute automatic abandonment of the mining claims

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Automatic Denial of MPSA Application:** Failure to comply with DMO No. 97-07 deadlines results in automatic denial of the MPSA application. This creates a significant risk of losing the right to explore and develop the area.
*   **Loss of Preferential Rights:** Non-compliance constitutes automatic abandonment of the mining claim and opens the area to other applicants (Rapid City Realty & Development Corporation)
*   **No Extension of Deadlines:** DMO No. 97-07 explicitly prohibits any extension of the prescribed deadlines. This strict interpretation leaves no room for leniency.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 463:**  Mineral Resources Development Decree of 1974, the operative law at the time Moya filed her application.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995):** The current governing law, emphasizing rational exploration, development, and utilization of mineral resources. Sections 3, 9, 113.
*   **Bonaventure Mining Corporation v. V.I.L. Mines, Inc., 584 Phil. 207 (2008):**  Reinforces the strict application of DMO No. 97-07, holding that noncompliance causes automatic cancellation of applications.
*   **Executive Order (E.O.) No. 279:** Instructs that mineral production sharing agreements should incorporate the minimum terms and conditions enumerated therein.
*   **DENR Administrative Order (DAO) No. 57:** sets forth the minimum requirements that must be submitted by prospective proponents.
*   **DAO No. 96-40**:  Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 7942, in compliance with the above mandate, sets a specific date for compliance.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument on Improper Service of Notices:** The petitioner argued improper service of the letters-notice and the order in violation of DMO No. 99-34. The Court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the deadlines under DMO No. 97-07 were absolute, and the subsequent notices were inconsequential after the deadlines had passed.

**Legal Analysis and Potential Arguments:**

*   The Court strongly sided with strict compliance with mining regulations and highlighted the lack of justification for Moya's failure to meet the deadlines. The discretionary reinstatement of the application by the DENR Secretary was deemed an excess of authority.
*   A potential argument for Moya's estate might involve exploring whether *force majeure* or other extraordinary circumstances prevented compliance. However, the decision suggests that a lack of diligence was the primary factor.
*   Future cases involving similar issues may be influenced by this ruling, reinforcing the importance of diligently adhering to all deadlines and requirements in mining applications.
