## Legal Document Summary: *Lapasaran v. People* (G.R. No. 179907)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA Decision affirming RTC conviction for Illegal Recruitment (RA 8042) and Estafa (RPC Art. 315(2)(a)).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Illegal Recruitment (RA 8042):** Defined as giving the impression of having the power to send someone abroad for work, inducing them to part with money. Proof of actual authority is not required, only the *impression* of authority. *See People v. Gasacao, People v. Gallardo, People v. Ordoño.*
*   **Estafa (RPC Art. 315(2)(a)):** Defrauding another through false pretenses or fraudulent acts, causing pecuniary damage. Specifically, falsely pretending to possess agency, business, or imaginary transactions. *See People v. Ordoño, People v. Comila, People v. Ballesteros.*
*   **Penalties:**
    *   **Illegal Recruitment:** Indeterminate penalty of 6 years, 1 day to 8 years imprisonment, and a fine of P200,000.00 (affirmed by CA). RA 8042 Sec. 7(a)
    *   **Estafa:** Indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months of *prision correccional* to 11 years, 8 months, and 21 days of *prision mayor* (modified by CA, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law).

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Lapasaran):** Liable for both Illegal Recruitment and Estafa. Ordered to pay fine for Illegal recruitment, and is imprisonment for both offenses
*   **Victim (Villarin):** Suffered pecuniary damage due to Lapasaran's misrepresentations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The primary dispute revolved around whether Lapasaran represented herself as a recruiter for overseas employment or merely offered visa assistance. The Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
*   **Overlapping Offenses:** The case highlights the possibility of being convicted of both illegal recruitment and estafa arising from the same transaction. The court clarifies that this is permissible as Illegal Recruitment is *malum prohibitum* and Estafa is *malum in se.* *See People v. Comila.*
*   **Penalty Calculation for Estafa:** The CA meticulously calculated the penalty for estafa based on the amount defrauded exceeding P22,000.00, as per Art. 315 of the RPC and Indeterminate Sentence Law, highlighting potential complexities in penalty determination.

The penalties were calculated in accordance with the relevant laws and jurisprudence. This case reinforces the principle that individuals falsely representing their ability to secure overseas employment will be held liable under both labor laws and criminal statutes.
