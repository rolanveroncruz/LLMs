**Case Summary: *People v. Frondozo*, G.R. No. 177164 (June 30, 2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Ramon Frondozo for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) - illegal sale of dangerous drugs (Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or *shabu*).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Frondozo was charged with selling 0.02 gram of *shabu* to a poseur-buyer (PO1 Abner Butay).
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** Police officers conducted a buy-bust operation based on information about Frondozo's drug activities.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented testimonies from the poseur-buyer, forensic chemist, and police investigator. The *shabu* was marked "RFD-01" and tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride. Buy-bust money was used.
*   **Defense:** Frondozo denied the accusations, claiming frame-up and extortion by the police (specifically PO1 Butay due to a prior suspicion of theft of fighting cocks and demand of PHP 50,000). Frondozo claimed that the buy-bust operation did not happen and that the police entered his home illegally.
*   **Lower Court Decisions:** Both the RTC and Court of Appeals convicted Frondozo, imposing life imprisonment and a fine of PHP 500,000.

**Key Legal Issues & Liabilities:**

*   **Elements of Illegal Sale (Sec. 5, RA 9165):** The Supreme Court emphasizes the essential elements for proving illegal sale of dangerous drugs: (1) the transaction occurred, (2) the illicit drug (corpus delicti) was presented, and (3) the buyer and seller were identified. *People v. Bandang, G.R. No. 151314, June 3, 2004, 430 SCRA 570, 579*.
*   **Chain of Custody (Sec. 21, IRR of RA 9165):** The court emphasizes the importance of strict compliance with Section 21 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165 regarding the post-seizure procedure for handling seized drugs. Critical failures include: immediate marking, inventory, and photography of seized items *in the presence of the accused, or their representative/counsel, and representatives from the media, DOJ, and an elected public official.*
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The Supreme Court held that the lower courts erred in relying solely on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties to convict Frondozo, especially given the irregularities in the buy-bust operation. *People v. Dela Cruz, G.R. No. 181545, October 8, 2008*. This presumption is overturned when the performance is tainted with irregularities.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The lack of compliance with mandatory procedures raises doubt as to the origin and identity of the drug, thus undermining the *corpus delicti.* Absence of a *corpus delicti* is fatal to the prosecution. *Malillin v. People, G.R. No. 172953, April 30, 2008, 553 SCRA 619, 631-632*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Insufficient Adherence to Statutory Procedure:** This is the critical flaw. The prosecution's failure to adhere to the mandatory procedures outlined in Section 21 of the IRR of RA 9165 regarding the handling and chain of custody of the *shabu* raises serious doubts about the integrity of the evidence. The absence of evidence demonstrating marking of the *shabu* in the presence of Frondozo, and the failure to document the seizure with inventory, photographs and required witnesses weakens the prosecution's case.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:**  Frondozo's allegations of frame-up and extortion, while seemingly self-serving, highlight potential issues with the credibility of the police officers involved, which is magnified by irregularities in the procedure.

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Frondozo due to reasonable doubt, emphasizing the failure of the prosecution to establish the *corpus delicti* beyond reasonable doubt.
