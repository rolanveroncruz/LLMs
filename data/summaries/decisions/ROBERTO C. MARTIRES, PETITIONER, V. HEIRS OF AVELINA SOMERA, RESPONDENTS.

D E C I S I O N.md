## Legal Document Summary: Martires v. Heirs of Somera, G.R. No. 210789

**Case Summary:** This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning the admissibility of depositions taken in New York City in an *accion reivindicatoria* and *accion publiciana* case. The Petitioner, Martires, contests the CA's decision affirming the RTC's admission of the depositions of the original plaintiff, Somera, and her witnesses. The core issue revolves around the adequacy of the notice provided to Martires regarding the deposition-taking.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 23, Sections 1 & 4:** Establishes the right to take depositions and the admissibility of depositions under specific circumstances (e.g., witness residing over 100km away or outside the Philippines). The Court found that Section 4(c)(2) of the Rules of Court applies in this case because Avelina and her witnesses resided in the United States.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 23, Section 15 (now possibly renumbered):**  Petitioner's primary argument hinges on the lack of "reasonable prior notice in writing" for the depositions, claiming this is a *sine qua non* for admissibility.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 23, Section 29(a):** The CA and SC heavily relied on this provision, which states that irregularities in deposition notices are waived unless a written objection is promptly served.  The Court held Martires waived his objection due to a delay of over three years in raising it.
*   **Court Ruling on Notice:** The Supreme Court found that while the original motion indicated the deposition-taking would be scheduled in July 2007, and the proceeding was actually conducted on September 27, 2007, it could not be said that petitioner was caught off guard by the belated conduct of the deposition because the petitioner was informed on September 3, 2007 that the deposition would be taken on September 27, 2007 and because petitioner admits that in an Order dated July 5, 2007, the RTC granted the motion to conduct deposition.
*   **Rebuttal Right:** The court reiterates that even with admission, any party may rebut deposition evidence at trial (Rule 23, Section 9).
*   **Evidentiary Value:** The Court states that the admissibility of the deposition does not preclude the determination of its probative value at the appropriate time and clarifies that the admissibility of evidence should not be equated with the weight of the evidence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Parties:** Obligated to provide proper notice for depositions.
*   **Objecting Parties:** Must promptly object in writing to any irregularities in deposition notices to avoid waiver.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness of "Reasonable Notice":** While the court acknowledged the requirement of reasonable notice, the specific parameters for determining reasonableness aren't definitively clarified. The finding hinged on prior knowledge and waived objection.
*   **Impact of "Waiver" Ruling:** This ruling creates a potential for abuse if notices are intentionally late, as the "promptness" requirement may be interpreted strictly against objecting parties.
*   **Dilatory Tactics:** The Court accuses petitioner of using technicalities to prolong the case, highlighting a risk of sanctions for similar behavior in future cases.
*   **Propriety of Certiorari:** The Court notes that appeal, not certiorari, is the proper remedy for the correction of any error as to the admission of depositions into evidence

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Dasmari√±as Garments, Inc. v. Judge Reyes:** This case is cited for its explanation of the purpose of depositions as a mode of discovery and the general requirement of in-court testimony, alongside the exceptions for using depositions in lieu of live testimony.
*   **Cathay Pacific Airways v. Spouses Fuentebella:** This case is cited for its definition of the word notice.
*   **Republic v. Sandiganbayan and Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corp. v. Ley Construction and Development Corp.:** These cases are cited for their findings that deposition discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment.
*   **Ayala Land Inc. v. Judge Tagle:** This case is cited for its discussion of the differences between admissibility of evidence and weight of evidence.
*   **Ginete v. Court of Appeals and Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. v. Angara:** These cases are cited for the ruling that rules of procedure are mere tools intended to facilitate the attainment of justice, rather than frustrate it.
*   **W.W.Dearing v. Fred Wilson & Co., Inc.:** This case is cited for the Court's ruling that appeal, not certiorari, is the proper remedy for the correction of any error as to the admission of depositions into evidence.
