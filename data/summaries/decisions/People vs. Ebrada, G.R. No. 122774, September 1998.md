## Case Summary: People v. Ebrada, G.R. No. 122774 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Regional Trial Court decision convicting Edgardo (Egay) Ebrada of murder for the stabbing death of Lolito Magbanua, Jr.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Conviction for Murder:** Trial court found Ebrada guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, based on eyewitness testimony and the victim's dying declaration/res gestae statement identifying Ebrada as the assailant.
*   **Treachery Present:** The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's finding of treachery. The court noted that the unprovoked attack from behind, without warning, deprived the victim of any chance to defend himself, ensuring the crime's execution without risk to the accused. *People vs. Tamparong, Jr., et al., G.R. No. 112713, October 25, 1995, 249 SCRA 584; People vs. Escandor, et al., G.R. No. 95049, December 9, 1996, 265 SCRA 444*
*   **Self-Defense Rejected:** Ebrada's self-defense claim was rejected due to the nature and location of the wound (stabbed in the back), the lack of unlawful aggression by the victim, and Ebrada's flight from the scene. *People vs. Rey, G.R. No. 80089, April 13, 1989, 172 SCRA 149*
*   **Civil Liabilities:**
    *   **Moral Damages:** Affirmed award of moral damages to the victim's widow. *TSN, May 31, 1994, 14-15*
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** Award of exemplary damages was DELETED due to the prosecution's failure to prove any generic aggravating circumstances. *People vs. Patrolla, Jr., G.R. No. 112445, March 7, 1996, 254 SCRA 467*
    *   **Civil Indemnity:** Added an award of P50,000.00 as indemnity for the death of the victim.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Ebrada is obligated to pay the heirs of the victim:
    *   Reclusion Perpetua (imprisonment).
    *   P360,000.00 as compensatory damages (unrealized earnings)
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages.
    *   P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for death.
    *   Cost of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Eyewitness Credibility:** Appellant attempted to discredit the testimony of the prosecution eyewitness, Mariano Millama, by alleging several inconsistencies in his testimony. However, the Supreme Court stated that these inconsistencies were too trivial and insignificant to merit consideration and did not affect the substance of their testimonies.*People vs. Martinada, et al., G.R. Nos. 66401-03, February 13, 1991, 194 SCRA 36; People vs. Ulili, supra, Fn. 10*
*   **Dying Declaration/Res Gestae:** The victim's statement on the way to the hospital was considered both a dying declaration and part of res gestae, strengthening the prosecution's case.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (Murder)
*   Civil Code of the Philippines (Damages)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The classification of the victim's statement as both a dying declaration and part of res gestae might be challenged, depending on specific nuances of evidence.

**Case Law:**

*   The court cited numerous cases regarding witness credibility, self-defense, treachery, and the admissibility of dying declarations and res gestae. Relevant cases are listed at the end of the judicial decision.
