**Case Summary: *Daan v. Sandiganbayan*, G.R. Nos. 163972-77, March 28, 2008**

**Facts:**

Petitioner Daan, charged with multiple counts of malversation of public funds and falsification of public documents (Criminal Cases Nos. 24167-24170, 24195-24196) before the Sandiganbayan, sought to plea bargain. He offered to plead guilty to the lesser offenses of falsification by a private individual (Article 172, RPC) in the falsification cases, and failure of an accountable officer to render accounts (Article 218, RPC) in the malversation cases. The prosecution favorably recommended the plea bargain, citing Daan's restitution of the full amount (P18,860.00) and his willingness to assist in the prosecution of the principal accused, Mayor Kuizon.

**Issue:**

Whether the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in denying Daan's plea bargaining proposal, despite the prosecution's favorable recommendation.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) held that the Sandiganbayan did commit grave abuse of discretion and *GRANTED* the petition, *ORDERING* the Sandiganbayan to grant Daan's Motion to Plea Bargain.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **Plea Bargaining (Section 2, Rule 116, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure):** The SC reaffirms plea bargaining as a process where the accused and prosecution agree on a mutually acceptable resolution, subject to court approval. While plea bargaining is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, the SC can and will intervene in the interest of justice.
*   **Trial Court Discretion:** Citing *People v. Villarama* (G.R. No. 99287, June 23, 1992), the SC acknowledges that accepting a plea to a lesser offense is not a right but is within the trial court's discretion. However, this discretion must not be arbitrary or whimsical.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The SC found grave abuse of discretion because (1) there was a favorable recommendation from the Office of the Special Prosecutor, (2) Daan restituted the money, and (3) the lesser offenses are necessarily included in the offenses charged.
*   **Lesser Included Offenses:** The Court applies Section 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court (when an offense includes or is included in another). It concludes that falsification by a private individual and failure to render an account are necessarily included in the charged crimes of falsification of public documents and malversation, respectively. This is because the elements of the lesser offenses form part of, or are essential elements of, the greater offenses.
*   **Equitable Considerations:** The SC emphasizes the need for equitable justice, contrasting Daan's case with the *People v. Estrada* case where Charlie "Atong" Ang's plea bargain was approved for a more serious crime (Plunder).
*   **Daan's Role:** The SC noted that Daan's role as a foreman/timekeeper did not make him an accountable officer, further supporting the plea to failure to render accounts.

**Obligations:**

*   **Sandiganbayan:** Obligated to grant Daan's Motion to Plea Bargain and conduct further proceedings consistent with the SC's decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   Daan's potential liability is reduced from malversation and falsification of public documents to the lesser offenses of failure to render accounts and falsification by a private individual.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Sandiganbayan's Interpretation:** The Sandiganbayan could still try to impose a relatively harsh sentence within the range applicable to the lesser offenses.
*   **Prosecution's Cooperation:** While the prosecution initially recommended the plea bargain, they could become less cooperative in the sentencing phase, influencing the Sandiganbayan.

*   Prepare a persuasive sentencing memorandum emphasizing the mitigating circumstances.
