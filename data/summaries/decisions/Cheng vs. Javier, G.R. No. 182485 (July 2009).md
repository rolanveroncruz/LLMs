Here's a summary of the legal document, focusing on the key aspects for a legal professional:

**Case:** *Sps. Henry O and Pacita Cheng v. Sps. Jose Javier and Claudia Dailisan*, G.R. No. 182485, July 3, 2009 (609 Phil. 434)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision which set aside the RTC's denial of a Motion for Execution.

**Background:**

*   Respondents (Javier) filed a complaint in 1979 for annulment of a contract of sale involving land, alleging fraud and incomplete payment by Petitioners (Cheng).
*   The RTC ruled in favor of Respondents, declaring the Deed of Sale null and void, ordering cancellation of TCT, directing Respondents to return P20,000 to Petitioners, and ordering Respondents to pay attorney's fees.
*   Respondents' appeal was denied for being filed late. Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was also denied.
*   Respondents then filed a motion for execution 13 years after the denial of petitioners' motion for reconsideration, which the RTC denied due to prescription.
*   The CA reversed, leading to this petition.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** The central issue is whether the 1987 RTC Decision had become final and executory. The SC ruled that it did become final and executory.
*   **Notice of Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration:** Respondents claimed Petitioners never received a copy of the order denying their motion for reconsideration, delaying the start of the appeal period. The Court held that respondents failed to prove that a copy was not sent to Petitioners or that it was not received by their former counsel.
*   **Prescription:** Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court states that a motion for execution must be filed within five years of entry of judgment. Failure to do so requires a separate action for revival of judgment, subject to the statute of limitations.
*   **Laches:** The Court found Respondents guilty of laches. The court defined Laches as a failure or neglect for an unreasonable length of time to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.
*   **Rule 13, Section 8 of the Rules of Court:** This governs the completeness of service. Service is deemed complete when petitioners former counsel received in November of 1989 a copy of the October 16, 1989 Order by registered mail.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Respondents (Javier):** Failure to timely execute the judgment resulted in the loss of their right to enforce it via motion. They are obligated to return the P20,000 down payment and pay attorney's fees.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The core risk is the loss of the opportunity to enforce the 1987 judgment due to the expiration of the prescriptive period for execution.
*   Contentious issue: The proof of notice of the Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration was disputed, turning on the adequacy of the Clerk of Court's certification vs. the presumption of regularity and the party averring a negative fact proving the fact.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 6, Rules of Court:**  Governs execution of judgments, time limitations, and revival.
*   **Heirs of Pedro Lopez vs. Hondesto de Castro, et al., G.R. No. 112905, February 3, 2000:** invoked by the trial court in denying the original motion for execution.
*   **Rule 133, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:** states that the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence
*   **Section 8, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court:** Discusses completeness of service.
*   **Felix v. Buenaseda, 310 Phil. 161, 174 (1995):** Cites Laches
*   **Pineda v. Heirs of Eliseo Guevara, G.R. No. 143188, February 14, 2007, 515 SCRA 627, 635:** Cites Laches

**Outcome:**

*   The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals' decision. The RTC's original order denying the motion for execution was reinstated.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   Focuses on the prescriptive period and the legal standard for proving lack of notice.
*   Highlights the Respondents' delay and inaction.
*   Emphasizes the obligation to monitor the case's progress.
