## Legal Document Summary: *Romeo A. Almario v. Atty. Dominica Llera-Agno* (A.C. No. 10689)

This case involves an administrative complaint filed by Romeo A. Almario against Atty. Dominica Llera-Agno for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Alleged notarization of a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) by Atty. Agno without the personal appearance of one of the affiants, Francisca A. Mallari.
*   **Complainant's Claims:**
    *   SPA was falsified as Mallari was in Japan during notarization, as evidenced by a Bureau of Immigration certification.
    *   SPA was used in a civil case (Judicial Partition with Delivery of Certificate of Title, Civil Case No. 06-115416) to perpetrate fraud against Almario, leading to criminal charges (Art. 172, RPC) against the attorney-in-fact, Ma. Lourdes Almario Pedia.
    *   Violation of Canons 1 and 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (specifically Rules 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, and 10.01) for dishonest conduct and lack of candor to the court.
    *   Violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice for failure to require personal appearance and for accepting a Community Tax Certificate (CTC) as sole identification.
*   **Respondent's Defense:**
    *   Mallari had the SPA executed and later acknowledged before the Philippine Consulate in Tokyo, Japan, purportedly giving it retroactive effect.
    *   Notarization done for expediency.
    *   Good faith, citing subsequent acknowledgment and a court-approved Compromise Agreement in the related civil case.
    *   CTC acceptable when other IDs unavailable.
    *   Accusation of fraud against complainant

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Agno:** Held liable for violating Section 1 and Section 2(b), Rule IV of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice, specifically the requirement of personal appearance for notarization, as stipulated in said rules. The SC emphasized that the personal presence is necessary to verify the signature and ensure the document's voluntary execution.
*   **Notary Public's Duty:** The decision reiterated a notary public's duty to ensure the identity of the affiants and the genuineness of the document.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Personal Appearance:** The central risk is the invalidity or questionable validity of the SPA due to the lack of personal appearance. This raises concerns about due process and the potential for fraud.
*   **Retroactive Effect:** Respondent's claim of retroactive effect is legally questionable, as notarization typically requires contemporaneous verification of identity.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (Rule II, Sec. 1; Rule IV, Sec. 2(b)):** The primary legal basis for the ruling, emphasizing the requirement of personal appearance.
*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (Canons 1 and 10; Rules 1.01, 1.02, 1.03 and 10.01):** Basis for professional misconduct, including dishonest conduct and lack of candor.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Art. 172):** Referenced in relation to the criminal case filed against the attorney-in-fact.
*   **Ferguson v. Atty. Ramos (A.C. No. 9209, Apri1 18, 2017):** Emphasized the importance of notarization as an act imbued with public interest.
*   **Ocampo-Ingcoco v. Atty. Yrreverre, Jr., 458 Phd. 803, 813 (2003); Coquia v. Laforteza, A.C. No. 9364, February 8, 2017:** Reiterated that a notary public must not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the very same persons who executed the same, and personally appeared before him to attest to the truth of the contents thereof.

**Outcome & Implications:**

*   Atty. Agno was found liable for violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice and was suspended as a notary public for two months (reduced from the IBP's recommended six months).
*   The decision serves as a reminder to notaries public of their duty to strictly comply with the requirements of personal appearance and proper identification.
*   The case highlights the potential legal repercussions of improper notarization, including administrative sanctions and potential civil or criminal liability.
