**Re: Summary of A.M. No. RTJ-24-055 (Alexander F. Balutan v. Hon. Joselito C. Villarosa)**

This administrative case concerns Judge Joselito C. Villarosa's conduct in Civil Case No. 11-310 (TMA Group v. PCSO) and arises from a complaint filed by Alexander F. Balutan, then General Manager of PCSO. The Supreme Court (SC) found Judge Villarosa GUILTY of Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Misconduct, and Grave Abuse of Authority, all violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct, and penalized him with a fine of PHP 200,000.00, forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits), and disqualification from public office.

**Key Provisions & Actions of Judge Villarosa:**

*   **Grant of Motion to Direct PCSO to Exclusive Deal with TMA (5/18/2016 Order):** Judge Villarosa granted TMA's motion to be the exclusive source of PCSO's lottery consumables, effectively barring NPO and other entities. This motion occurred while PCSO's challenge to a prior injunction order was pending in the Court of Appeals.
*   **Issuance of Summary Judgment (12/5/2017):** Judge Villarosa issued a summary judgment that the preliminary injunction orders were substituted by a *permanent* mandatory and prohibitory injunction.
*   **Issuance of Writ of Execution of Summary Judgment (1/18/2018 Order):** Based on the summary judgment, Judge Villarosa ordered the sheriff to execute against PCSO's assets in the amount of PHP 707,223,555.44. This order was issued *despite* the pendency of the case before the Supreme Court.

**Obligations Violated & Liabilities:**

*   **Canon 6, New Code of Judicial Conduct:** Failed to maintain competence and diligence. Specifically, he was obligated to maintain and enhance his knowledge of the law.
*   **Disregard of TRO (G.R. No. 212143):** Judge Villarosa issued the Summary Judgement and Writ of Execution *despite* a Temporary Restraining Order issued by the SC against the November 6, 2013 Order. This was considered a "stubborn disregard of the rules."

**Legal Basis for SC Decision & Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Rule 140, Rules of Court:** Classifies Gross Ignorance of the Law, Gross Misconduct, and Grave Abuse of Authority as serious charges, justifying severe sanctions.
*   ***Department of Justice v. Mislang, 791 Phil. 219 (2016):*** Defines Gross Ignorance of the Law as failure to know straightforward law and evident facts. Good faith is not a defense when there's a blatant disregard of clear statutory provisions and Supreme Court Circulars.
*   ***Philippine National Construction Corp. v. Mupas, 889 Phil. 641 (2020):*** Judges have an obligation to know and apply basic legal principles.
*   ***Golangco v. Villanueva, 343 Phil. 937 (1997):*** Disregarding a Supreme Court TRO is not only ignorance of the law but also Grave Abuse of Authority, Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Proper Administration of Justice.
*   ***Office of the Court Administrator v. Dumayas, 827 Phil. 173 (2018):*** Persistent disregard of well-known rules can indicate gross misconduct.
*   ***Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp. v. Omelio, A.M. RTJ-23-031, March 28, 2023*** Defines grave abuse of authority.
*   ***Villaflor v. Amatong, 398 Phil. 503 (2000):*** Brazen disregard of a TRO constitutes Grave Abuse of Authority.

**Contentious Areas & Potential Risks:**

*   **Prematurity Defense:** Judge Villarosa initially argued the administrative complaint was premature because the petitions for review were not yet resolved. The SC ultimately rejected this, finding his actions demonstrably improper regardless of the outcome of those appeals.
*   **Error of Judgment vs. Malice:** While mere errors in judgment are usually protected, the SC found Judge Villarosa's actions exceeded simple error and constituted deliberate disregard of established legal principles and SC orders.

**Conclusion:**

Judge Villarosa's actions were deemed a serious breach of judicial conduct due to the disregard of a TRO, issuance of the writ of execution and the gross ignorance of the law displayed. The SC imposed the maximum fine allowable under the rules, along with forfeiture of retirement benefits and disqualification from public office, because the conduct was seen as not just mistaken, but reckless and prejudicial to the administration of justice.
