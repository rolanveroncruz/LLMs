## Legal Document Summary: Fortich v. Corona, 352 Phil. 461 (1998)

**Case Overview:** This case involves a dispute over the conversion of a 144-hectare agricultural land in Sumilao, Bukidnon, owned by NQSRMDC, to an agro-industrial area. The Office of the President (OP) initially approved the conversion, but later modified its decision following a hunger strike by alleged farmer-beneficiaries, ordering 100 hectares to be distributed to them. The petitioners (Fortich, Baula, and NQSRMDC) challenged the OP's modified resolution (the "Win-Win" Resolution).

**Key Issue:** The central legal issue is the validity of the "Win-Win" Resolution issued by the Office of the President, substantially modifying its earlier Decision approving the land conversion after that earlier Decision had become final and executory.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Original OP Decision:** Approved the conversion of the entire 144 hectares from agricultural to agro-industrial/institutional use.
*   **"Win-Win" Resolution:** Modified the original decision, approving conversion for only 44 hectares and ordering the distribution of the remaining 100 hectares to qualified farmer-beneficiaries. Directed DAR to identify qualified beneficiaries and expedite just compensation to NQSRMDC.
*   **Obligations:**
    *   DAR: Determine qualified farmer-beneficiaries, expedite payment of just compensation.
    *   NQSRMDC: Potentially cede 100 hectares for distribution.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **NQSRMDC:** Loss of 100 hectares of land, potential disputes over just compensation. Risk that DAR may not adequately value the land or fairly determine compensation.
*   **Farmer-Beneficiaries:** Risk of not being deemed "qualified" or of delays in distribution. Potential challenges from NQSRMDC or others.
*   **DAR:** Potential for legal challenges regarding beneficiary selection and valuation.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Governs the distribution of land to qualified farmer-beneficiaries. Section 65 allows land conversion under certain circumstances.
*   **R.A. No. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Section 20 grants local government units the power to reclassify agricultural lands.
*   **Administrative Order No. 18:** Governs appeals to the Office of the President.
*   **Rule 43, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs appeals from quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 65, Revised Rules of Court:** Governs special civil actions for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.
*   **People vs. Cuaresma, et. al., 172 SCRA 415** Discusses the heirarchy of courts regarding writs of certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus.
*   **El Banco Espa√±ol-Filipino vs. Palanca, 37 Phil. 921** Discusses actions of the Court that may be considered a "lawless thing"

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Qualified farmer-beneficiaries":** The criteria for determining "qualified farmer-beneficiaries" are not explicitly defined in the "Win-Win" Resolution, potentially leading to disputes.
*   **"Just compensation":** The method for determining "just compensation" is not specified, potentially leading to disputes over valuation.

**Key Arguments & Holding:**

*   **Petitioners' Argument:** The "Win-Win" Resolution was issued with grave abuse of discretion because it modified a final and executory decision. The hunger strike constituted undue pressure on the Office of the President.
*   **Respondents' Argument:** Petitioners should have filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals.
*   **Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, NULLIFIED the "Win-Win" Resolution, and DENIED the motion for intervention filed by the alleged farmer-beneficiaries. The Court held that the Office of the President lost jurisdiction to modify its earlier decision once it became final and executory. The Court asserted it's discretion to take cognizance of petitions filed directly to it if compelling reasons, or the nature and importance of the issues raised, warrant.

**Potential Future Litigation:**

*   Further litigation regarding the status of the 100 hectares will occur given the Court's opinion.
*   Additional arguments regarding compensation will possibly lead to further causes of action.
