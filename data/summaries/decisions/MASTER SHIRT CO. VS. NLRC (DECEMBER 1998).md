**Case Summary: Master Shirt Co., Inc. vs. NLRC**

**Case:** Master Shirt Co., Inc and Lily Eng Yao v. NLRC and Master Shirt Employees Union-Anglo (G.R. No. 124957, December 29, 1998)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Third Division

**Holding:** Petition dismissed; NLRC decision affirming the Labor Arbiter's award of separation pay and attorney's fees to employees of Master Shirt Co., Inc. upheld.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Agreement:** The core of the ruling centers on the August 19, 1993 agreement between Master Shirt Co., Inc. and the union. This agreement stipulated that if the company failed to resume operations within six months after a factory fire, workers would receive separation benefits.
*   **Separation Pay:** The agreement established an obligation to pay separation benefits if the company failed to re-open within six months. The Labor Arbiter calculated this at one-half (1/2) month's pay for every year of service.
*   **Surety Bond:** Western Guaranty Corporation issued a surety bond guaranteeing satisfaction of the NLRC decision up to P1,881,988.70. The Labor Arbiter later ordered them to release that amount to NLRC.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Master Shirt Co., Inc.:** Liable for separation pay to its employees based on the aforementioned agreement, as affirmed by the NLRC and upheld by the Supreme Court.
*   **Western Guaranty Corporation:** Liable to the extent of its surety bond (P1,881,988.70) to satisfy the judgment, subject to possible challenges related to the writ's initial recall.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Enforceability of Agreement:** Petitioners unsuccessfully argued against the enforceability of the agreement. The Supreme Court deemed it the "law between the parties."
*   **Recall of Writ of Execution:** The Labor Arbiter's initial recall of the writ of execution, followed by the order to Western Guaranty to release funds, presents a potential procedural challenge. Petitioners argued the recall voided the notice of garnishment.
*   **Insurance Claim:** The company's argument that it could not pay because of a pending insurance claim was rejected. This is a crucial point: the obligation to pay separation pay was not contingent on insurance recovery.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Bontia vs. NLRC, 255 SCRA 167 (1996):** Cited regarding the valid termination of employment and the payment of separation pay due to retrenchment, closure of business or disease.
*   **Anita Salavarria vs. NLRC, G.R. No. 110396, September 25, 1998:** The basis for the award of separation pay is the agreement which was entered into by Master Shirt Co., Inc and its union employees. The agreement is the law between the parties and must be enforced.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The agreement itself is concise but its lack of specificity regarding the *source* of separation pay funds created a point of contention. Master Shirt Co. unsuccessfully argued their obligation was contingent on an insurance payout.

**Legal Advice Required:**

*   Examine the language of the August 19, 1993 agreement closely.
*   Thoroughly review all records related to the issuance, recall, and re-issuance of the writ of execution.
*   Determine if there are grounds to challenge the Labor Arbiter's orders regarding the surety bond, given the initial recall of the writ.
