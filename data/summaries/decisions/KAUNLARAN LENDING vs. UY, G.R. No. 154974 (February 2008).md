**Case Summary: Kaunlaran Lending Investors, Inc. v. Uy, G.R. No. 154974 (2008)**

**Key Issue:** Validity of Real Estate Mortgage securing a P800,000 loan. Loreta Uy (respondent) claimed the mortgage was obtained through fraud and lacked consideration. Kaunlaran Lending Investors, Inc. (KLII) sought to foreclose.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Special Power of Attorney (SPA):** Loreta Uy granted her son, Jose, an SPA to obtain a loan and mortgage her properties (TCT Nos. 78622 & 78623) as security.
*   **Loan Purpose:** Allegedly for a buy-and-sell vehicle business involving Jose, Wilfredo Chua, and Virgilio Sim.
*   **KLII Loan:** Loreta purportedly signed loan documents, including a promissory note and Real Estate Mortgage, in favor of KLII for P800,000.
*   **Dispute:** Loreta claimed she did not receive the loan proceeds and that her signatures were obtained fraudulently. She alleged the proceeds were used to pay Wilfredo's debt to Lelia Chua Sy.
*   **Promissory Note and Real Estate Mortgage:** Loreta signed a promissory note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage in favor of KLII.
*   **Solidbank Check:** A check was made to Loreta's name, the proceeds of which she acknowledged.

**Obligations:**

*   **Loreta Uy:** Was obligated to pay KLII the P800,000 loan plus interest per the promissory note and secured by the real estate mortgage, which trial court found to be 48% per annum.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Trial Court:** Held the Real Estate Mortgage and Promissory Note valid and legal, ordering Loreta to pay KLII the loan amount with interest. It also ordered Wilfredo to pay Loreta P800,000 plus interest, and damages based on the presumption he misappropriated the funds.
*   **Court of Appeals:** Reversed, declaring the mortgage and note null and void. Ordered all defendants-appellants to pay, jointly and severally, attoney's fees of P100,000.00 to Loreta.
*   **Supreme Court:** Reversed the Court of Appeals, reinstated the Trial Court Decision.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Fraud/Vitiated Consent:** Loreta's core argument hinged on fraud and lack of consent in signing the mortgage documents.
*   **Lack of Consideration:** Loreta argued she never received the loan proceeds, suggesting a failure of consideration.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The appellate court relied on testimony of Magno Zareno which was contrary to his statements under oath. The assessment of witness credibility was crucial to the outcome, with the Court of Appeals deviating from the trial court's assessment without sufficient justification.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Section 13, Rule 132** Impeachment by Previous Contradictory Statement
*   Metro Drug Distribution, Inc. v. Narciso, G.R. No. 147478, July 17, 2006, 495 SCRA 286, 293 Defective verification and certificate of non-forum shopping.
*   People v. Atadero, 435 Phil. 888, 905 (2002) Findings of fact of the trial court carry great weight and are entitled to respect on appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Circumstances of Loan Disbursement:** Unclear how the loan proceeds were handled and disbursed.
*   **Alleged Diversion of Funds:** Loreta's allegation that the loan proceeds were diverted to pay Wilfredo's debt to Lelia.
*   **Authority to Sign Verification/Certification:** The authority of Rolando Tan, KLII's president, to sign the verification and certification on behalf of the company was initially questioned.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals erred in overturning the trial court's findings. The trial court was in a better position to assess witness credibility. The Court held Loreta did not prove her claim of fraud or lack of consideration by preponderance of evidence.
