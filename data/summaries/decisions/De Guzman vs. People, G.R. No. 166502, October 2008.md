**Case Summary: *Francisco de Guzman v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 166502 (2008)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmance of the RTC's conviction for Robbery with Force Upon Things.

**Key Facts:**

*   Defendant Francisco de Guzman assisted Ramon Valdez (acquitted by the RTC) in retrieving personal properties from the house of Lucia Valdez, Ramon's stepmother. Ramon claimed these properties belonged to his deceased mother and were being improperly sold by Lucia.
*   De Guzman's defense was lack of intent to gain (animus lucrandi); he claimed he merely helped Ramon. A wooden bench was temporarily placed outside his house.

**Legal Issue:**

*   Whether the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that de Guzman acted with intent to gain (animus lucrandi), a necessary element of robbery under Article 293 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA and acquitted de Guzman, finding that the prosecution failed to establish intent to gain beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 293, Revised Penal Code:** Defines Robbery, requiring (1) personal property belonging to another, (2) unlawful taking, (3) intent to gain (animus lucrandi), and (4) violence, intimidation, or force.

**Liabilities:**

*   Originally, De Guzman was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment (prision correccional to prision mayor) and ordered to pay damages. This was overturned.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Intent to Gain (Animus Lucrandi):**  The central issue. The court found that de Guzman's actions were consistent with merely assisting Ramon under the belief that Ramon owned the property. His explanation for the presence of the bench at his house was deemed sufficient. The presumption of intent to gain arising from unlawful taking was rebutted by the specific circumstances.
*   **Affidavit of Desistance:**  The affidavit of desistance executed by Lucia Valdez after the conviction of the accused was mentioned. The court gave it no persuasive value because they are regarded with caution.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The SC cited *People v. Reyes, G.R. No. 135682 (2003)* and *People v. Bustinera, G.R. No. 148233 (2004)* regarding the definition and proof of intent to gain.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC), Article 293:** Definition of Robbery.

**Analysis:**

The acquittal hinged on the SC's finding that the prosecution failed to prove intent to gain. De Guzman's actions, the lack of concealment, and his explanation for the bench's presence, all pointed to mere assistance rather than a criminal intent to profit or benefit from the taking. This case highlights the importance of proving all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly the elusive element of intent.
