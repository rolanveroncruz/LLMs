**Legal Document Summary: *Meralco Industrial Engineering Services Corporation vs. National Labor Relations Commission, Ofelia P. Landrito General Services and/or Ofelia P. Landrito***

**Citation:** 572 Phil. 94 (G.R. No. 145402, March 14, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Solidary liability of MIESCOR (principal) with OPLGS (contractor) for labor violations involving OPLGS's employees providing janitorial services to MIESCOR. Specifically, whether MIESCOR is solidarily liable for *separation pay*, *underpayment of wages*, and *non-payment of overtime pay*.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Contract Order No. 166-84:** Agreement between MIESCOR and OPLGS for janitorial services. This governs the relationship and payment terms.
*   **Complainants' Claims:** Initially illegal deduction, underpayment, non-payment of overtime/holiday pay, etc., later amended to include illegal dismissal.
*   **RA 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act):** MIESCOR argues it adjusted contract price with OPLGS to comply, absolving it of liability.
*   **Article 106-109, Labor Code:** Central to the liability determination. The Court interprets these sections to mean MIESCOR, as an indirect employer, is solidarily liable *only* for unpaid wages (including overtime pay) *due to the contractor's failure to pay*.
*   **Lack of Employer-Employee Relationship (MIESCOR-Employees):** Crucial point. Since no direct relationship, MIESCOR argues it cannot be held liable for separation pay, which stems from termination of employment.
*   **No Conspiracy in Illegal Dismissal:** Absence of evidence showing MIESCOR conspired with OPLGS in the alleged illegal dismissal. *Rosewood Processing, Inc. v. NLRC* provides that a principal is not solidarily liable for backwages and separation pay unless there is evidence that it conspired in acts giving rise to the illegal dismissal.
*   **Surety Bond:** OPLGS posted a surety bond sufficient to cover all judgment awards.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **OPLGS:** Primary obligation to pay separation pay as the direct employer of the employees. Also liable for underpayment of wages and non-payment of overtime pay.
*   **MIESCOR:** Solidarily liable with OPLGS for underpayment of wages and non-payment of overtime pay, but *not* for separation pay, provided OPLGS has posted a surety bond. Cannot seek recovery from MIESCOR because MIESCOR had already turned over payments that should have been made.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Article 109 Interpretation:** The broad language of Article 109 ("any violation of any provision of this Code") initially led the Court of Appeals to hold MIESCOR solidarily liable for separation pay. The Supreme Court's reversal hinges on a narrower reading of Article 109 in conjunction with Articles 106 and 107.
*   **Finality of NLRC Resolution (G.R. No. 111506):** MIESCOR erroneously argues a previous Supreme Court resolution (G.R. No. 111506) conclusively settled the issue of its liability for separation pay. The Court clarifies that the earlier resolution only addressed joint and several liability *generally* and enforcement of the surety bond, but not the specific issue of separation pay allocation.
*   **Right to Reimbursement:** The Court acknowledges its previous rulings allowing indirect employers to recover amounts paid to employees, but distinguishes that it cannot be applied in reverse in this case.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code (Presidential Decree No. 442):** Specifically, Articles 97(f) (definition of wages), 106 (contractor/subcontractor liability), 107 (indirect employer), and 109 (solidary liability).
*   **RA 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act):** Impact on MIESCOR's obligation to adjust contract price.
*   ***Philippine Airlines, Inc. v. NLRC***: Clarifies the extent of the indirect employer's liability as limited to unpaid wages.
*   ***Rosewood Processing, Inc. v. NLRC***: Deals with the principal's solidary liability in illegal dismissal cases and emphasizes the necessity for proof of conspiracy between the principal and the contractor.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, holding MIESCOR *not* solidarily liable for the separation pay of OPLGS's employees. MIESCOR's solidary liability is limited to unpaid wages and overtime pay, and even this liability is mitigated by the surety bond posted by OPLGS. The key factor is the lack of a direct employer-employee relationship between MIESCOR and the employees and the absence of conspiracy in the illegal dismissal. The existence of the surety bond removes the need for continuous solidary liability.
