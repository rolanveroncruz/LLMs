## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Ocampo*

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Benjamin Ocampo*, G.R. No. 177753, September 25, 2009. Murder conviction.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Appellant, Benjamin Ocampo, was charged with Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code for the fatal stabbing of Ruben Ngo. Treachery was alleged as a qualifying circumstance.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony (Mary Ann Lombay, Rosemarie Ngo) identifying Ocampo as the perpetrator. Medical evidence established the cause of death as hemorrhagic shock secondary to a stab wound to the neck. The defense presented an alibi and claimed Ocampo suffered from psychosis.
*   **Lower Court Ruling:** The RTC convicted Ocampo of Murder and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*, along with civil indemnity (₱50,000), actual damages (₱235,682.78), loss of earning capacity (₱671,760), and moral damages (₱300,000).
*   **Appeals Court Ruling:** Affirmed the conviction but modified damages. Actual damages were reduced to ₱69,681.70, and moral damages to ₱50,000. Loss of earning capacity was increased to ₱671,999.97. Exemplary damages (₱25,000) and temperate damages (₱25,000) were awarded.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Ocampo:** Found guilty of Murder, obligated to serve *reclusion perpetua* and pay civil, actual, and exemplary damages.
*   **Heirs of Ruben Ngo:** Entitled to compensation for the death of Ruben Ngo.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Identification:** Ocampo challenged his identification by claiming Mary Ann was influenced by suggestive photo identification. The SC dismissed this claim as the witness confirmed she identified him based on witnessing the crime, not the photo.
*   **Psychosis Defense:** The Court rejected Ocampo's reliance on a psychiatric evaluation report. The examining physician was not presented and the report was deemed hearsay. The SC also notes that the report did not establish Ocampo was incapable of rationally planning the crime.
*   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** The Supreme Court **reversed** the CA's increase of this award. Citing *Licyayo v. People*, the Court held that the victim's wife's testimony alone was insufficient to prove loss of earning capacity, as the victim earned more than the minimum wage.
*   **Temperate Damages:** The Supreme Court **deleted** this award, citing Art. 2224, the Civil Code; People v. Dizon.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** The Supreme Court **increased** the civil indemnity to P75,000.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Murder.
*   **Article 2230, Civil Code:** Discusses the award of exemplary damages in criminal offenses.
*   **Article 2224, Civil Code:** Defines temperate damages.
*   **Art. 2224 Civil Code: People v. Dizon** Recoverable only when pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot from the nature of the case be proved with certainty.

**Case Law References:**

*   **People v. Punsalan:** Appellate courts will not disturb the assessment by the trial court of the credibility of witnesses whose testimonies it has heard.
*   **Licyayo v. People:** The SC stated that testimonial evidence is insufficient to prove loss of earning capacity, as the victim earned more than the minimum wage.
*   **People v. Dizon:** Actual damages had been proven and awarded.
*   **People v. de Guzman:** Civil indemnity will be increased to P75,000.

**Final Outcome:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Ocampo for Murder with the following modifications: the award of civil indemnity was increased to P75,000, and the awards of loss of earning capacity and temperate damages were deleted.
