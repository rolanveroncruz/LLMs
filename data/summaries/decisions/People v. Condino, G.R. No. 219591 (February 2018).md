# Legal Document Summary: *People v. Condino*, G.R. No. 219591 (2018)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Generaldo M. Condino*

**Issue:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Generaldo Condino for murder. The primary issues on appeal are: (1) sufficiency of the prosecution's evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, considering alleged inconsistencies in witness testimonies; and (2) the existence of treachery.

**Facts:** Condino stabbed Isabelo Arrabis at the Barangay Hall after a hearing. The prosecution presented witnesses who testified that Condino calmly approached Arrabis, grabbed his neck, and stabbed him multiple times. The defense claimed self-defense, alleging Arrabis attacked Condino with a knife.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED the appeal, affirming the conviction with MODIFICATION of damages.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Murder (Article 248, Revised Penal Code):** The court upheld the conviction for murder.

*   **Treachery (Qualifying Circumstance):**  The Court agreed with the lower courts' finding that the attack was attended by treachery, as the victim was defenseless and unable to retaliate due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the assault. The means of execution were deliberately adopted by Condino to ensure the victim's demise without risk to himself. Refer to *People v. Alajay*, 456 Phil. 83 (2003).

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** Appellate courts accord the highest respect to the assessment made by the trial court because of the trial judge's unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination.

*   **Self-Defense (Defense Claim Rejected):** The court rejected Condino's self-defense claim due to lack of corroborating evidence and the RTC's finding that his testimony lacked credibility. The defense failed to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victim.

**Damages (Modified):**

*   Civil Indemnity: Increased to P75,000.00
*   Moral Damages: Increased to P75,000.00
*   Exemplary Damages: Increased to P75,000.00
*   Actual Damages: Deleted.
*   Temperate Damages: Awarded P50,000.00 in lieu of actual damages.
*   Interest: All damages to earn 6% per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid.  Refers to *People v. Jugueta, G.R. No. 202124, April 5, 2016*.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   The reliance on eyewitness testimony, while deemed credible by the lower courts, can be subject to scrutiny regarding perception and recall, although the court addressed this by citing the trial court's advantage in observing witness demeanor.
*   No explicit mention if weapon was recovered and admitted as evidence, and if it was the cause of death.
