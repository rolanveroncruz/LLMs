**Legal Document Summary: *Estate of Llenado v. Llenado, G.R. No. 145736, March 4, 2009***

**Subject:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision that reversed the RTC's annulment of a deed of conveyance, title, and damages concerning a parcel of land (Lot 249-D-1).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Lease Agreement:** Cornelio Llenado leased Lot 249-D-1 to Romeo Llenado, later assigned to Orlando Llenado (petitioner's predecessor).  The Agreement (3/31/1978) contained an option to renew and a clause prohibiting sale/transfer to third parties during the lease's enforcement.  A Supplementary Agreement (6/24/1978) extended renewal options to comply with requirements to establish a gasoline station.
*   **Sale of Land:** Cornelio sold Lot 249-D (including Lot 249-D-1) to his children, Eduardo and Jorge Llenado (respondents) in 1987.
*   **Dispute:** Wenifreda Llenado (Orlando's widow) refused to vacate the premises after Eduardo demanded she do so. Unlawful detainer case filed by Eduardo and ultimately decided in Eduardo's favor. Wenifreda then filed an action to annul the sale alleging violation of the lease's prohibition against sale and failure to honor an alleged right of first refusal.
*   **Lower Courts:** RTC ruled in favor of Wenifreda, declaring the sale null and void. CA reversed, dismissing the complaint.

**Issues:**

1.  Whether the sale from Cornelio to Eduardo and Jorge violated the lease agreement's non-alienation clause.
2.  Whether Orlando had a valid right of first refusal, violated by the sale.
3.  Whether RA 1162, as amended by RA 3516, applies to the lease.

**Held:** No legal basis to annul the deed of conveyance.

**Court's Reasoning:**

*   **Lease Agreement Violation:** While the lease agreement was transferable to Orlando's heirs, the option to renew had to be actively exercised.  There was no evidence that Orlando's heirs exercised this option before the original lease expired. Since the lease agreement was not in force at the time of the sale, the non-alienation clause was not violated. *Dioquino v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. Nos. 68580-81, November 7, 1989, 179 SCRA 163*
*   **Right of First Refusal:**  While a right of first refusal can be proven by parol evidence (*Rosencor Development Corporation v. Inquing, 406 Phil. 565 (2001)*), the petitioner failed to present evidence demonstrating a promise existed.
*   **Republic Act (R.A.) Nos. 1162 and 3516:**  These were argued for the first time on appeal and should have been raised in lower court. Issue was not properly raised in the pleadings.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1517** In fine, the only issue for our determination is whether the sale of the subject lot by Cornelio to his sons, respondents Eduardo and Jorge, is invalid for (1) violating the prohibitory clause in the lease agreement between Cornelio, as lessor-owner, and Orlando, as lessee; and (2) contravening the right of first refusal of Orlando over the subject lot.

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Estate of Orlando Llenado is liable for costs.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The decision underscores the importance of providing clear and convincing evidence that the option to renew was exercised.
*   **Statute of Frauds:** The decision confirms that a right of first refusal is not subject to the Statute of Frauds, making the case dependent on the credibility of the testimony.
*   **Waiver:** The respondents argued they had simply tolerated the situation rather than recognizing an exercised option, which was upheld by the Court.
