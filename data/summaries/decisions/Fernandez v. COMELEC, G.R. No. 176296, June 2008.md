Okay, here's a concise legal summary of *Fernandez v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 176296, June 30, 2008)*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Indira R. Fernandez v. COMELEC and Mark Anthony B. Rodriguez* (G.R. No. 176296)

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines (En Banc)

**Date:** June 30, 2008

**Summary:**

This case involves a petition for certiorari and prohibition challenging the COMELEC's (First Division) ruling that declared Rodriguez the duly elected SK Chairman. The MCTC had originally ruled in favor of Fernandez.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Election Contest:**  Dispute arose from the 2002 SK elections. Fernandez (Petitioner) initially lost to Rodriguez (Respondent) but won after a revision by the MCTC.
*   **MCTC Decision:** The 4th MCTC of Pandan-Caramoran initially ruled in favor of Fernandez, based on a recount.
*   **COMELEC Appeal:** Rodriguez appealed to the COMELEC, which reversed the MCTC's decision.
*   **COMELEC Ruling:** COMELEC First Division overturned the MCTC decision, ruling that 3 ballots were erroneously credited to Fernandez because they appeared to be tampered. Applying the principle that if a ballot is altered by someone other than the voter, it should be counted for the original candidate.
*   **Mootness:**  The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the petition because the term of the contested office had expired (extended to November 30, 2007, by R.A. 9340).

**Jurisdictional Issue:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Fernandez argued that the COMELEC lacked appellate jurisdiction over SK official election contests decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction (MCTC).
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court rejected this argument. Citing Article IX-C, Section 2(2) of the Constitution (appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction) and Section 387(a) of the Local Government Code (SK chairmen are barangay officials). The Court explicitly overruled previous conflicting jurisprudence (specifically referencing *Mercado v. Board of Election Supervisors*) and affirmed the COMELEC's appellate jurisdiction.

**Legal Principles & Statutory References:**

*   **Constitution, Article IX-C, Section 2(2):** Grants COMELEC appellate jurisdiction over contests involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction.
*   **R.A. 7160 (Local Government Code):** Defines SK chairman as a barangay official.
*   **R.A. 9164:** Sets the term of SK officials.
*   **R.A. 9340:** Amended R.A. 9164 to extend the term, rendering the case moot.
*   **Doctrine of Mootness:** The Court acknowledged that the expiration of the term rendered a substantive ruling unenforceable, but still addressed the jurisdictional issue for future guidance.

**Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Tampered Ballots:** The COMELEC's reliance on the apparent tampering of ballots could be subject to scrutiny if the case had not been mooted. The standard for determining tampering and the burden of proof would be important considerations.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The underlying factual dispute regarding the validity of the ballots remained unresolved due to mootness.
*   **Application of *Mercado*:** The Supreme Court clarified the applicability of its prior ruling in *Mercado*, providing clarity on the COMELEC's jurisdiction.
*   **Grave Abuse of Discretion:** Petitioner claimed the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion by nullifying the lower court's decision. This claim was not addressed because of the mootness doctrine.

**Outcome:**

Petition dismissed as moot. The Court affirmed the COMELEC's appellate jurisdiction over election contests involving SK officials but did not rule on the merits of the COMELEC's decision due to the expiration of the contested term.
