## Legal Document Summary: *Phil-Man Marine Agency, Inc. vs. Dedace* (G.R. No. 199162)

**Case Overview:** Petition for review on *certiorari* challenging the CA decision which reversed the NLRC's denial of permanent total disability benefits to seafarer Aniano Dedace, Jr.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **POEA-SEC:** The 2000 POEA-SEC governs the employment contract and mandates integration into every Filipino seafarer's contract. Sec. 20(B) outlines employer liabilities for work-related injury or illness. Sec. 32 outlines schedule of disability benefits.
*   **Employer's Obligation:** To provide sickness allowance and disability benefits for work-related illnesses.
*   **Seafarer's Obligation:** To undergo post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days of repatriation (unless physically incapacitated).
* **120-Day Rule:** The company-designated physician must assess the seafarer's medical condition and degree of disability within 120 days of repatriation. Failure to do so results in the seafarer being deemed totally and permanently disabled.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Employer's Liability:** Payment of permanent total disability benefits (US$60,000.00), sickness allowance, and attorney's fees if the illness is work-related and assessment is not performed within 120-day period. Joint and several liability between the agency and the principal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Failure to Timely Assess:**  The core risk is the failure of the company-designated physician to provide a "full, complete, and categorical" assessment of the seafarer's condition within 120 days as prescribed by POEA-SEC Sec. 20(B)(3), leading to automatic total and permanent disability. Ambiguous or incomplete assessments can also result in liability. *Libang, Jr. v. Indochina Ship Management, Inc.* (743 Phil. 286, 299 (2014)) emphasizes this point.
*   **Inadequate Medical Justification:** Simply stating an illness is not work-related is insufficient. The physician must justify this assessment with medical findings. *Dohle-Philman Manning Agency, Inc. v. Heirs of Andres G. Gazzingan* (760 Phil. 861, 880 (2015)).
*   **Disputable Presumption:** The employer bears the burden of overcoming the disputable presumption that illnesses not listed in Sec. 32-A of the POEA-SEC are work-related.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **2000 POEA-SEC, Section 20(B):** Crucial for defining work-related illness, compensability, and the 120-day assessment period.
*   **2000 POEA-SEC, Sections 32 & 32A:** Schedules of disabilities and occupational illnesses respectively.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code** - Instances where attorney's fees may be awarded.
*   **Article 111 of the Labor Code** - Provides for awarding of attorney's fees in cases of unlawful withholding of wages.
*    *Magsaysay Maritime Corporation v. NLRC* (630 Phil. 352 (2010)): Previously invoked by the petitioner, distinguished as the company-designated physician provided a sufficient explanation for their assessment.
*   *Libang, Jr. v. Indochina Ship Management, Inc.* (743 Phil. 286, 299 (2014)): Emphasizes the importance of a full assessment of the seafarer's condition by the company-designated physician.
*   *Dohle-Philman Manning Agency, Inc. v. Heirs of Andres G. Gazzingan* (760 Phil. 861, 880 (2015)): Stresses the need for the company designated physician to justify their findings and not rely on bare claims.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The ambiguity lies in the subjective interpretation of what constitutes a "full, complete, and categorical" medical assessment.  The mere diagnosis may not suffice if the rationale and supporting findings are not adequately explained.
*   The medical findings provided by the company doctor in this case are insufficient as there was no explanation for the statement that Dedace's illness is not work-related.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision, holding the petitioners liable for permanent total disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees.  The key factor was the company-designated physician's failure to provide a complete and justified medical assessment within the 120-day period.
