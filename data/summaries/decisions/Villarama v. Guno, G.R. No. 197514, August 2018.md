## Legal Document Summary: *Villarama v. Guno*, G.R. No. 197514 (2018)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision that nullified RTC's denial of Crisantomas Guno's Motion to Vacate Judgment based on improper service of summons.

**Key Issue:** Whether valid service of summons was effected on Crisantomas Guno in Civil Case No. Q-97-31700 (Rescission of Promissory Notes, Deed of Sale, Cancellation of Title, and Damages).

**Holding:** SC GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA, and DENIED Crisantomas Guno's Motion to Vacate Judgment. SC held that service of alias summons on Carmelita Yadao Guno was binding on her husband, Crisantomas, as well.

**Key Provisions & Rationale:**

*   **Action *in personam*:** The case is an action *in personam*, seeking rescission of obligations related to a deed of sale and promissory notes.
*   **Conjugal Partnership:**  The underlying obligations were incurred during the marriage of Sps. Guno prior to the effectivity of the Family Code, thus governed by the conjugal partnership of gains under the Civil Code (Art. 118, 160, 161(1)). The deed of sale and promissory notes were therefore the responsibility of the conjugal partnership.
*   **Binding Effect of Service on Spouse:** Service of summons on Carmelita, the wife, was deemed binding on Crisantomas due to their conjugal partnership and shared interests. This is based on the rationale of protecting the right to due process.
*   **Lack of Proof of Separation:** Crisantomas failed to adequately substantiate his claim of non-receipt of summons or separation from his wife at the time of service.  A bare denial is insufficient proof.  *GSIS v. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.*, 721 Phil. 740 (2013).
*   **Active Participation of Spouse:** Carmelita actively participated in the proceedings, litigating their shared interests. The SC was clearly influenced by preventing further delays in a case already in litigation for a considerable time.
*   ***Montefalcon v. Vasquez*, 577 Phil. 383 (2008):** Cited to support the principle that a plaintiff is only required to know the defendant's residence or business place and is not responsible for ensuring the actual delivery of the summons.
*   ***Manotoc v. Court of Appeals*, 530 Phil. 454 (2006):** Affirmed the importance of a valid summons to the court's jurisdiction, but this was distinguished by the Court due to the conjugal partnership relationship and shared interests.
*   **Affidavit Insufficiency**: Crisantomas Guno's affidavit, where he states that he never resided or lived at No. 408 P. Bernald Street., (sic), Ugong, Pasig City, was not accepted as a fact. 

**Obligations:**

*   Original decision of RTC that rescinded the promissory notes and deed of sale, directing cancellation of title, and awarding liquidated damages and attorney's fees remains in effect against Crisantomas D. Guno.

**Liabilities:**

*   Crisantomas is liable for damages (liquidated and attorney's fees) as determined by the RTC.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Procedural Due Process:** The decision potentially stretches the boundaries of procedural due process. While aiming for efficiency, it could be argued that the individual rights of Crisantomas were compromised by imputing the knowledge of the legal proceedings based on his marital relationship.
*   **Finality and Execution:** The outcome hinges on the finality of related decisions concerning the subject property and obligations. Executing against Crisantomas may face challenges if his personal assets are separate and distinct from the former conjugal property.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code (prior to Family Code): Articles 118, 160, 161(1).
*   Family Code: Articles 116, 121.
*   Rules of Court: Rule 14 (Summons)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The finding that service on the wife is automatically binding on the husband raises concerns about individual due process, especially given the potential for marital discord, separation (even if unproven legally), and differing interests. The Court emphasizes the factual circumstances (conjugal property, apparent shared interests, lack of proof of separation) to justify the ruling, suggesting it may not be broadly applicable.

**Case Law:**

*   *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals*, 530 Phil. 454 (2006)
*   *GSIS v. Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.*, 721 Phil. 740 (2013)
*   *Carandang v. Heirs of Quirino A. de Guzman*, 538 Phil. 319 (2006)
*   *Biaco v. Phil. Countryside Rural Bank*, 544 Phil. 45 (2007)
*   *Montefalcon v. Vasquez*, 577 Phil. 383 (2008)
