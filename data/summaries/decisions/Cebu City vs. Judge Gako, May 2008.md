**A.M. No. RTJ-08-2111 (Formerly A.M. No. 05-2207-RTJ) - Summary**

**Case:** City of Cebu vs. Judge Ireneo Lee Gako, Jr.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, En Banc

**Decision Date:** May 7, 2008

**Nature:** Administrative complaint against a retired judge for serious misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, willful violation of rules and laws, judicial interference, tolerating forum-shopping, and violation of the Code of Judicial Ethics.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Undue Delay (Civil Case No. CEB-29570):** Judge Gako found GUILTY of undue delay in rendering a decision in Civil Case No. CEB-29570 (Cebu Ports Authority vs. City of Cebu). The Court determined a delay of approximately 9 months, violating Canon 3, Rule 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, requiring prompt disposition of court business. The decision was supposed to be resolved within 90 days or by March 12, 2004 but only came out December 6, 2004.
*   **Other Charges Dismissed:** All other charges (serious misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, willful violation of rules, judicial interference, tolerating forum shopping) were DISMISSED. The court found the claims unsubstantiated.
    *   **CEB-26607:** No irregularity was found in the judge calling and questioning a witness of the court as the judge has discretion to call additional witnesses to enlighten on particular facts.
    *   **CEB-26066, CEB-29550, CEB-29730, CEB-30411, CEB-30684:** Claims regarding the respondent's decisions on these cases lack proof that respondent acted with malice or corrupt motive.
*   **Retirement:** While Judge Gako had retired, the case was not moot as the complaint was filed during his service. His retirement was a factor in determining the penalty.

**Obligations Breached:**

*   Judge Gako failed to decide Civil Case No. CEB-29570 within the constitutionally mandated 90-day timeframe (Article VIII, Section 15(1) of the Constitution).

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended a fine of P11,000.00 and a 6-month suspension without pay
*   Ultimately, the Supreme Court imposed a FINE of P40,000.00, to be deducted from his retirement benefits, in lieu of suspension due to his retirement. This was in light of previous administrative infractions cited. (Rallos vs Judge Lee Gako, Jr., Zamora vs Judge Gako, Jr., Lagcao vs Gako, Jr.)

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in Determining Undue Delay:** The determination of "undue delay" can be subjective. While the Court noted the judge's explanation (imminent settlement) was unpersuasive, similar explanations could potentially be used in other cases.
*   **Motion for Inhibition:** The Court's comment advising Judge Gako to voluntarily inhibit himself from cases involving the complainant is a suggestion, not a mandate, and its enforceability is questionable given his retirement.
*   **Reliance on Prior Case Law:** The Court cited several cases on a judge's discretion to call witnesses but drew a distinction between exercising that discretion and the failure to render a timely decision.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**
