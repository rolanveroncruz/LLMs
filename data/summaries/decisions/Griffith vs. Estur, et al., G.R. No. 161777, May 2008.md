## Legal Document Summary: *Griffith v. Estur* G.R. No. 161777

This case involves a Petition for Review of the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the NLRC's denial of a motion to quash a writ of execution in a labor case (illegal dismissal, nonpayment of benefits).

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Underlying Judgment:** Labor Arbiter Layawen's decision, final and executory as of July 6, 2001, held Lincoln Gerald, Inc. (corporation) and Dominic Griffith (petitioner, former VP) solidarily liable to respondents (employees) for backwages, separation pay, and 13th-month pay.
*   **Issue on Appeal:** Petitioner challenged the *manner* of execution, specifically his personal liability under the writ and the inclusion of an execution fee.
*   **Petitioner's Arguments:**
    *   He should not be personally liable as a corporate officer acting in good faith.
    *   Inclusion of the execution fee in the writ constituted an impermissible modification of the final judgment.
    *   He was no longer the VP when the complaint was filed.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Solidary Liability:** Both the corporation and Griffith (petitioner) are liable to pay the judgment debt.  The finality of the Arbiter's decision precludes challenging this liability now.
*   **Execution Fee:**  The inclusion of the execution fee in the writ is proper and consistent with Section 6, Rule IX of the Sheriff Manual, which allows for the collection of execution fees from the losing party.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement:** Petitioner is subject to the execution of the judgment against his personal assets due to the solidary liability established in the Arbiter's final decision.
*   **No Further Appeal:** The Supreme Court's denial effectively closes the door for further challenges on the underlying liability or the propriety of the writ's inclusion of the execution fee.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Finality of Judgment:** *Gallardo-Corro v. Gallardo*, underscores the immutability of final judgments.
*   **Execution of Judgment:** *Abbott v. NLRC*, recognizes the right to challenge the *manner* of execution even when the underlying judgment is final.
*   **Sheriff Manual:** Section 6, Rule IX governs the inclusion of execution fees against the losing party.
*   **NLRC Rules:** Mentioned by the Court of Appeals regarding motions for reconsideration and perfection of appeal.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of Griffith's involvement and authority within the corporation is not clearly defined. The finality of the decision prevents challenging this, but it could have been grounds for contesting personal liability earlier.
* The petitioner's claim that he was no longer the VP when the complaint was filed was given no weight by the court due to lack of evidence.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions based primarily on the principle of finality of judgment. Petitioner's arguments challenging the manner of execution failed, as the inclusion of the execution fee was deemed permissible. The key risk is the continued enforcement of the judgment against both the corporation and the petitioner personally.
