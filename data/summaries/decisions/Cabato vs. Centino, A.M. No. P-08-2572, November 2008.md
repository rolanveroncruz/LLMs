**A.M. No. P-08-2572 (Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 08-2950-P)**

**Case Summary:** This is an administrative matter concerning Felix S. Centino, a process server of the RTC Branch 59, Baguio City, charged with gross misconduct and serious misbehavior due to habitual absenteeism and failure to submit required documents. The complainant is Judge Iluminada P. Cabato.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Habitual Absenteeism:** Centino incurred unauthorized absences exceeding 2.5 days monthly leave credit for multiple months in 2006. Specifically, absences in February, March, April, and May of 2006.
*   **Failure to Submit Documents:** Centino failed to submit his Daily Time Records (DTRs) and leave applications as required. His last DTR was submitted in October 2005, and leave applications in September 2005.
*   **OCA Findings:** The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Centino guilty of habitual absenteeism, recommending a three-month suspension without pay.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court considered Centino's return to work, regular reporting, submission of DTRs, length of service, acknowledgment of infraction, remorse and apology as mitigating circumstances.
* **Unauthorized Leave:** Centino had 167.5 days of vacation leave without pay approved. He also had absences marked as unauthorized leave for more than 30 days, violating Section 63 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave.

**Obligations:**

*   Centino was obligated to adhere to Civil Service Rules and Regulations regarding attendance and leave applications.
*   He was obligated to respond to memoranda issued by Judge Cabato.
*   As a court employee, he was obligated to uphold the principle of public office as a public trust.

**Liabilities:**

*   Centino was found administratively liable for habitual absenteeism.
*   He was subjected to a suspension of three months without pay.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Centino was sternly warned that further acts of disobedience could result in more severe penalties, including dismissal.
*   The extended period of unauthorized leave could have led to separation from service under Section 63 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 23(q) of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations:** Defines habitual absenteeism and its corresponding penalties.
*   **Administrative Circular No. 14-2002:** Reiterates the Civil Service Commission's policy on habitual absenteeism.
*   **Section 57 of the Omnibus Rules on Leave:** Pertains to the limits of leave without pay and the required clearances.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court found Felix S. Centino guilty of habitual absenteeism and suspended him for three months without pay. He was sternly warned against future violations.
