## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Amamangpang* (G.R. No. 108491)

**Case:** *People of the Philippines vs. Sergio Amamangpang*

**Facts:** Accused Sergio Amamangpang killed SPO1 Placido Flores with a scythe and .38 caliber revolver. He claimed defense of wife's honor (Art. 11, RPC) or death under exceptional circumstances (Art. 247, RPC) after allegedly finding Flores assaulting his wife. The RTC convicted him of murder.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction, finding Amamangpang guilty of Homicide instead, and modified the sentence accordingly.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Article 248, Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Murder (originally charged; SC overturned based on lack of proven treachery).
*   **Article 11(2), RPC:** Justifying circumstance â€“ Defense of Relatives. Accused carries the burden of proving unlawful aggression, reasonable necessity, and lack of provocation. (Defense failed in this case due to inconsistent evidence and contradictory testimony.) Cites *People v. Bausing* (199 SCRA 355 (1991)
*   **Article 247, RPC:** Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances. Requires surprising the spouse in the act of intercourse, and acting "in the act or immediately thereafter". (Defense failed as inconsistent with defense of a wife, which claims a lack of consent. The defense is also inconsistent with the testimonies of the wife and daughter that Flores threatened to kill them if they refused to accede to his wishes.
*   **Article 249, RPC:** Homicide. Applies when murder is not proven (e.g., treachery is absent).
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** Considered a mitigating circumstance if the requisites are met: The offender had not actually been arrested, the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority or to an agent of a person in authority, and the surrender was voluntary. Cites *People v. Decena, 235 SCRA 67 (1994); People v. Amaguin, 229 SCRA 166 (1994).*

**Liabilities:**

*   Originally convicted of Murder.
*   SC found accused guilty of Homicide.
*   Indeterminate sentence imposed:  six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor minimum as minimum penalty to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal minimum as maximum penalty.
*   Financial indemnity to the heirs of the victim was affirmed.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery:** The prosecution argued that treachery existed, turning the homicide into murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The SC ultimately reversed the conviction, concluding that the prosecution's eyewitness failed to witness the initial attack.
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** Significant discrepancies in the testimonies of the accused, his wife, and his daughter regarding the victim's clothing and the location of the assault undermined the credibility of their defense.

**Analysis:**

The case hinged on whether the killing constituted murder or homicide and whether the accused could successfully invoke the defense of a relative or death under exceptional circumstances. The SC found that the prosecution failed to prove treachery beyond a reasonable doubt, thus reducing the conviction to homicide. The defenses were rejected due to inconsistencies in the evidence and witness testimonies.
