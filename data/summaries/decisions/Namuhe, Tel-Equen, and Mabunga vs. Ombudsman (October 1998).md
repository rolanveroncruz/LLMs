**Legal Document Summary: *Namuhe v. The Ombudsman* (G.R. Nos. 124965, 124932, 124913)**

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing an Ombudsman Resolution dismissing petitioners from government service for dishonesty, falsification of public documents, misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. The petitions also challenge the OMB's denial of reconsideration.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Underlying Issue:** The OMB Task Force on Public Works and Highways filed administrative complaints against petitioners, who were officials in the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) in Mountain Province and Ifugao. The charges stemmed from irregularities relating to a purported public bidding for Bailey bridge components, alleging a conspiracy to defraud the government. Specifically, the OMB found that a bidding did not take place and the government was made to pay for its own property.
*   **OMB Ruling:** The Ombudsman found petitioners Jimmie F. Tel-Equen, Rolando D. Ramirez, Rudy P. Antonio, Romulo H. Mabunga, and Romeo C. Namuhe guilty as charged and ordered their dismissal.
*   **Petitioners' Arguments:** Petitioners challenged the factual findings and conclusions of the OMB, claiming weak or inadmissible evidence, misappreciation of facts, and lack of factual/legal basis.
*   **Fabian v. Desierto (G.R. No. 129742, September 16, 1998) Impact:** The Court, citing *Fabian v. Desierto*, raised the issue of jurisdiction *motu proprio*. *Fabian* declared Section 27 of RA 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989) unconstitutional as it improperly expanded the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.

**Ruling of the Supreme Court**
The Supreme Court agreed with the ruling set in Fabian v. Desierto stating that the Court of Appeals has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Office of the Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases. These consolidated cases were transferred to the Court of Appeals for final disposition.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989), Section 27:** Declared unconstitutional in *Fabian v. Desierto*.

**Case Law:**

*   **Fabian v. Desierto (G.R. No. 129742, September 16, 1998):** Critical precedent establishing the Court of Appeals as the proper venue for appeals from Ombudsman decisions in administrative cases.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Finality of OMB Decision:** Although the case is transferred, the OMB's factual findings and conclusions remain in effect until overturned by the Court of Appeals.
*   **Burden of Proof:** Petitioners bear the burden of demonstrating errors in the OMB's decision before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Evidence Admissibility:** The admissibility and sufficiency of evidence presented to the OMB may be challenged in the Court of Appeals.

**Recommendations:**

*   File Amended Petitions for Review under Rule 43 with the Court of Appeals without prejudice.
*   Address factual findings of the OMB in detail with the Court of Appeals.
