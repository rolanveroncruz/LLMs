**Case Name:** Heirs of Juan Valdez, et al. vs. Court of Appeals and L.C. Lopez Resources, Inc.
**G.R. No.:** 163208
**Date:** August 13, 2008
**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Summary:**
This case involves conflicting resolutions issued by the Court of Appeals (CA) regarding a petition for certiorari and prohibition (CA-G.R. SP No. 76286) filed by L.C. Lopez Resources, Inc. ("Lopez Resources") against the Heirs of Juan Valdez, et al. ("Valdez Heirs") challenging a Regional Trial Court (RTC) order and writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued in a quieting of title case (Civil Case No. 00-6015).

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Conflicting Resolutions:** The CA issued two resolutions on the same date (May 5, 2003). One dismissed CA-G.R. SP No. 76286 without prejudice due to a deficiency in the certification against forum shopping, citing Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court. The other resolution directed the Valdez Heirs to file a comment while requiring Lopez Resources to rectify the deficiency.

*   **Forum Shopping and Litis Pendentia:** Following the conflicting Resolutions, Lopez Resources re-filed the petition, correcting the deficiency, which was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 77615. The Valdez Heirs argued that the re-filing constituted forum shopping and litis pendentia.

*   **CA Clarification:** The CA subsequently issued a Resolution on August 1, 2003, clarifying that the dismissal resolution was a "clerical error" and intended for the Valdez Heirs to comment. The CA later ordered the contents of the rollo of CA-G.R. SP No. 77615 be incorporated into CA-G.R. SP No. 76286.

*   **SC Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the petition of the Valdez Heirs, upholding the CA's August 1, 2003 Resolution. The SC reasoned that the CA's error of releasing two conflicting resolutions did not constitute grave abuse of discretion, given its power to dismiss without prejudice or allow rectification of the deficiency. The SC found no indication of bad faith or forum shopping by Lopez Resources, as it acted pursuant to the initial order of dismissal without prejudice. The SC applied the principle of consolidation by analogy. The court reminded the justices of the CA of their duty to exercise prudence, caution, and attention in the performance of their duties.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Lopez Resources:** Rectification of the deficiency in its non-forum shopping certification. Although not explicitly liable, the initial deficiency in the certification caused the initial dismissal.
*   **Valdez Heirs:** To file comments on CA-G.R. SP No. 76286.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Resolutions:** While the SC upheld the CA's clarification, the initial conflicting resolutions created confusion and legal uncertainty, requiring extensive litigation to resolve.
*   **"Clerical Error" Justification:** The CA's reliance on a "clerical error" explanation is somewhat questionable, especially given the significant legal implications of the dismissal resolution.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the requirements for a certification against forum shopping and the consequences of non-compliance.
*   **Rule 31 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Concerns the consolidation of cases.
*   **Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals:** Mentions consolidation practices within the CA.

**Case Law:**

*   The SC cited several cases allowing initiatory pleadings with initially defective verifications and certifications of non-forum shopping on the ground of substantial compliance (e.g., *Vicar International Construction, Inc. v. FEB Leasing and Finance Corp.*, *Ateneo de Naga University v. Manalo*).
*   *Sacdalan v. Court of Appeals* regarding the immutability of judgement rule.
*   Times Transit Co., Inc. v. Sotelo and Development Bank of the Philippines v. La Campana Development Corp for definition of forum shopping.

**Analysis:**

The SC's decision underscores the principle that courts should rectify their own mistakes, and that parties should not be prejudiced by such errors. The application of the principles of consolidation and the acceptance of substantial compliance are crucial in resolving procedural issues and ensuring a just outcome. The case also serves as a reminder to court personnel to exercise due diligence and care in the performance of their duties to maintain public trust in the judicial system. The issue of grave abuse of discretion was deemed not present, as the conflicting resolutions stemmed from a mistake rather than a deliberate act of partiality or disregard for the law.
