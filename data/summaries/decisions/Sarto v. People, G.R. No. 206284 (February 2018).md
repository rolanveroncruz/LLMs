**Case Summary: *Redante Sarto y Misalucha v. People of the Philippines* (G.R. No. 206284, February 28, 2018)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Petitioner Redante Sarto for Bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Redante Sarto married Maria Socorro Negrete on August 31, 1984.
*   Maria Socorro obtained a divorce in British Columbia, Canada, on November 1, 1988.
*   Redante then married Fe R. Aguila on December 29, 1998, without judicial recognition of the foreign divorce.
*   The prosecution presented marriage certificates as evidence of both marriages.
*   Defense presented a Certificate of Divorce but failed to authenticate it properly.
*   Maria Socorro remarried in Canada on August 5, 2000.
*   The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) later manifested advocating Redante's acquittal, submitting a copy of Maria Socorro's Canadian citizenship certificate.

**Issue:**

Whether the trial and appellate courts erred in finding Redante guilty of bigamy beyond reasonable doubt.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA's decision, upholding Redante's conviction.

**Key Provisions and Elements of Bigamy:**

*   **Article 349, Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes bigamy.
*   **Elements of Bigamy:** (1) Prior legal marriage, (2) prior marriage not legally dissolved or spouse not presumed dead, (3) subsequent marriage, and (4) subsequent marriage with all essential requisites for validity. (*Antone v. Beronilla*, 652 Phil. 151 (2010))

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Redante had the burden of proving the valid termination of his first marriage before contracting the second. (*Marbella-Bobis v. Bobis*, 391 Phil. 648 (2000)).
*   **Proof of Foreign Divorce:** Redante failed to properly prove the fact of divorce and the foreign law allowing it.

**Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Competent Evidence:** The Certificate of Divorce presented was deemed insufficient; it was not the divorce decree itself, nor was it properly authenticated as per Sections 24 and 25, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.
*   **Non-Recognition of Foreign Divorce:** The foreign divorce decree, even if valid in Canada, has no automatic effect in the Philippines. Recognition by Philippine courts is necessary.
*   **Failure to Prove Foreign Law:** Failure to present a copy of the Canadian law under which the divorce was secured means the court cannot take judicial notice of that law. (*Amor-Catalan v. Court of Appeals*, 543 Phil. 568 (2007)).
*   **Ambiguity of Divorce Type:** The type of divorce (absolute vs. limited) and its effect on Redante's capacity to remarry were not established.
*   **OSG's Misguided Argument:** The SC rejected the OSG's contention that the conviction was solely based on the lack of evidence regarding the date of Maria Socorro's Canadian citizenship.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 349:** Bigamy.
*   **Rule 132, Sections 24 & 25, Rules of Court:** Procedure for proving foreign documents.
*   **Family Code, Article 26(2):** Addresses the situation of Filipino spouse's divorce obtained by an alien spouse.
*   ***Republic v. Orbecido*, 509 Phil. 108 (2005):** Discusses the legislative intent behind Article 26(2) of the Family Code and requirements for recognizing foreign divorce.
*   ***Fujiki v. Marinay*, 712 Phil. 524 (2013):** Discusses recognition of foreign judgement relating to status of marriage.
*   ***Van Dorn v. Romillo*, 223 Phil. 357-363 (1985):** Discusses the integral aspect of claims or defense.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Continued Imprisonment:** Redante faces imprisonment for bigamy.
*   **Challenge to Second Marriage:** Fe R. Aguila-Sarto could potentially challenge the validity of the second marriage and seek annulment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Certificate of Divorce" presented was deemed insufficient, leading to a disagreement on whether it can be considered as the divorce decree.

**Conclusion:**

Redante's failure to properly authenticate the foreign divorce decree and prove the applicable foreign law resulted in the affirmation of his bigamy conviction. The court emphasized the importance of complying with the Rules of Court when presenting foreign judgments. The belated submission of Maria Socorro's citizenship certificate and the OSG's intervention were insufficient to overturn the conviction.
