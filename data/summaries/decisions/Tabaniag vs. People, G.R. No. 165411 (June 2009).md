Okay, here's a legal summary of *Tabaniag v. People*, G.R. No. 165411, June 18, 2009, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Wilma Tabaniag v. People of the Philippines*
**G.R. No.:** 165411
**Date:** June 18, 2009
**Ponente:** Peralta, J.

**Summary:**

This case involves a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) conviction of Wilma Tabaniag (Petitioner) for Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Supreme Court (SC) *reversed* the CA decision and acquitted Tabaniag.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner was charged with Estafa for allegedly misappropriating jewelry received in trust from Dennis and Victoria Espiritu.
*   **Trust Receipts:** Two trust receipts (Exhibits B and C) were signed by Petitioner acknowledging receipt of jewelry for sale with proceeds to be remitted or jewelry returned if unsold.
*   **Sub-Agency:** Petitioner entrusted the jewelry to a sub-agent, Jane Bisquera, who issued bouncing checks to Victoria Espiritu.
*   **Amended Information:** The Information was amended by the prosecution to reflect the amount and person from whom the jewelries were entrusted to the accused.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found Tabaniag guilty of Estafa, sentencing her to imprisonment and ordering her to indemnify the offended party.
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's conviction but modified the penalty. The CA emphasized that Tabaniag violated the trust agreement and misrepresented sales.
*   **Motion to Dismiss (Affidavit of Desistance):** Complainant (Dennis Espiritu) filed a Motion to Dismiss with an affidavit of desistance based on an amicable settlement, which the CA denied.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision, acquitting Tabaniag.

**Key Legal Issues and Analysis:**

1.  **Elements of Estafa (Art. 315, par. 1(b), RPC):** The SC reiterated the elements of Estafa under this provision: receipt of property in trust, misappropriation/conversion, prejudice to another, and demand.
2.  **Misappropriation/Conversion:** The core issue was whether Tabaniag misappropriated or converted the jewelry. The SC found that she did *not*. Her entrusting the jewelry to a sub-agent (Bisquera) *did not* automatically constitute Estafa.
3.  **Sub-Agency and *Serona v. Court of Appeals*:** The SC relied heavily on *Serona v. CA*, G.R. No. 130423, November 18, 2002. *Serona* held that delivering jewelry to a sub-agent for sale on commission *does not* constitute estafa through conversion or misappropriation. In the absence of express prohibition, employing a sub-agent is legally permissible under agency law.
4.  **No Prohibition of Sub-Agency:** The Court found the trust receipts did *not* expressly prohibit sub-agency. The restrictions listed (no sale on credit, no installment, etc.) related to the *manner* of disposal, *not* the *use of a sub-agent*.
5.  **Lack of Evidence of Conspiracy:** The prosecution presented no evidence that Tabaniag conspired with Bisquera to misappropriate the jewelry.
6.  **Civil Liability:** Although acquitted of Estafa, the SC acknowledged that Tabaniag *might* have civil liability. However, because a separate civil case (Civil Case No. 63131) had been instituted, the Court deemed it proper to resolve the civil aspect in that proceeding.
7.  **Invalidity of Motion to Dismiss:** The SC did not rule on the CA's denial of the Motion to Dismiss. The acquittal would moot the issue.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Trust Receipt Ambiguity:** While the SC interpreted the trust receipts as *not* prohibiting sub-agency, a more clearly drafted trust receipt *expressly prohibiting* sub-agency would have strengthened the prosecution's case. The ambiguity in the trust receipt language was a critical factor in the SC's decision.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 315, paragraph 1(b)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 133, Section 2.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

This case underscores the importance of:

*   **Clear Contractual Language:** Drafting trust receipts and agency agreements with explicit prohibitions on sub-agency, if that is the principal's intent.
*   **Proving Misappropriation:** In Estafa cases involving agency relationships, establishing *actual* misappropriation or conversion of funds or property, not merely a failure to remit due to the actions of a sub-agent.
*   **Proving Conspiracy:** If alleging conspiracy between the agent and a third party, presenting sufficient evidence to establish a common design and purpose.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court acquitted Tabaniag, finding a lack of evidence of misappropriation or conversion, as required by Art. 315, par. 1(b) of the RPC, and emphasizing the absence of an express prohibition against sub-agency. The decision highlights the prosecution's burden of proof in Estafa cases involving agency agreements and the importance of clear and unambiguous contract terms. While acquitted from criminal liability, the recovery of the civil liability was delegated to a separate court case.
