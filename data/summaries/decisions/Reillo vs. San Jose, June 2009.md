**Legal Document Summary: *Reillo v. San Jose*, G.R. No. 166393, June 18, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision affirming the RTC's grant of judgment on the pleadings and dismissal of a counter-petition for partition.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Annulment of Extrajudicial Settlement:** The RTC, affirmed by the CA, annulled the Deed of Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate Among Heirs with Waiver of Rights and TCT No. M-94400 issued to petitioner Ma. Teresa F. Pi√±on (Teresa). This was predicated on the misrepresentation in the deed that petitioners were the "sole heirs" of Quiterio and Antonina San Jose, when, in fact, respondents (other children and grandchildren) also had inheritance rights.
*   **Partition Order:** The RTC ordered the partition of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 458396 in accordance with intestate succession laws.
*   **Dismissal of Counter-Petition for Partition:** The RTC dismissed petitioners' counter-petition for partition of 12 other parcels of land for failure to pay docket fees.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners:** Liable for misrepresenting themselves as sole heirs, leading to the annulment of the settlement deed and title. They are also responsible for the consequences of failing to pay docket fees for their counter-petition, including its dismissal.
*   **Heirs of Quiterio and Antonina San Jose:** Obligated to participate in the partition of the subject parcel of land according to intestate succession.
*   **Register of Deeds:** Obligated to cancel TCT No. M-94400.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Sole Heir" Misrepresentation:** The central issue revolves around the misrepresentation of the petitioners being the legitimate descendants and sole heirs. This triggers Article 1081 of the Civil Code, regarding rescission/annulment of partition where an heir was excluded due to bad faith or fraud.
*   **Counterclaim Characterization:** The characterization of the counter-petition for partition as *permissive* versus *compulsory* is critical. The court ruled it permissive, requiring docket fees. Petitioners argued for a compulsory counterclaim, exempt from immediate docket fees.
*   **Lack of Jurisdiction over Counterclaim:** The CA upheld the dismissal of the counter petition due to non payment of docket fees. The petitioners argued the RTC should have directed payment, citing procedural due process. The Court finds the petitioners failed to comply.
*   **Partition Procedure (Rules 74 & 76):** Petitioners argued the partition order was rendered without proper publication as allegedly required under Rules 74 and 76 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (extrajudicial and judicial settlements, respectively). The Court correctly found no need for publication for this instance, as per Rule 69.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 34, Section 1:** Judgment on the Pleadings.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 6, Sections 6 & 7:** Compulsory and Permissive Counterclaims.

*Tan v. De la Vega, G.R. No. 168809, March 10, 2006: Defines the rules of granting judgment on the pleadings

**Ambiguities & Contentions:**

*   The primary contention is whether the Answer tendered a sufficient issue to preclude judgment on the pleadings. The Court focused on the admission regarding the number of children of the deceased spouses, negating the "sole heir" claim.
*   The determination of whether the "other properties" need a special proceeding to be partitioned.
*   Rules of intestate succession of the property must follow the specific laws and processes of intestate succession.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court affirmed the annulment of the extrajudicial settlement and title due to misrepresentation. The failure to pay docket fees on the counter-petition for partition led to its dismissal. The order for partition of the *subject* property was upheld, but requires adherence to intestate succession laws. A separate action will likely be required to address partition of the remaining properties. The misrepresentation in the extrajudicial settlement deed is the critical flaw that led to the unfavorable outcome for petitioners.
