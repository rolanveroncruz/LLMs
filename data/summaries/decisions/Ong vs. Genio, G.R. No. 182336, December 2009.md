**Case Summary: *Elvira O. Ong v. Jose Casim Genio*, G.R. No. 182336, December 23, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the CA's dismissal of a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus.  The CA dismissed the case due to lack of personality of the private offended party to appeal the dismissal of a criminal case without the OSG's conformity.

**Facts:**

*   Petitioner Ong filed a criminal complaint for Robbery against Respondent Genio, which the City Prosecutor initially dismissed. The DOJ reversed this and filed an Information for Robbery in RTC Makati, alleging the unlawful taking of kitchen and canteen equipment valued at Php 700,000.
*   Respondent moved to dismiss based on lack of probable cause under Rule 112, Section 6(a), and the RTC initially agreed, citing the Information's failure to allege intent to gain or violence/intimidation.
*   Respondent filed a *partial* motion for reconsideration seeking outright dismissal for lack of probable cause, which the RTC granted.
*   Petitioner sought reconsideration, arguing the RTC misapplied Rule 112, Section 6(a), which, she argued, only governs warrant issuance, not the determination of probable cause to file the Information. The RTC denied.
*   Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus in the CA. The CA dismissed the case, holding that only the OSG could appeal the criminal aspect.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Rule 112, Section 6(a), Rules of Criminal Procedure:**  Allows the RTC to dismiss a case if the evidence on record clearly fails to establish probable cause upon evaluating the prosecutor's resolution and supporting evidence.
*   **Section 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987:**  The OSG has the exclusive authority to represent the Government of the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities, and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation, or matter requiring the services of lawyers.
*   **OSG Representation:** The OSG's role as the sole representative of the People in criminal proceedings.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Standing:** Petitioner, as the private offended party, lacks standing to appeal the criminal aspect of the case without the OSG's involvement. *People v. Santiago* and *Rodriguez v. Gadiane* are cited as the controlling jurisprudence.
*   **Dismissal based on Probable Cause:** The RTC's authority, under Rule 112, Section 6(a), to dismiss the case if the evidence clearly fails to establish probable cause, despite the DOJ's contrary finding.
*   **Civil Liability:** The ruling explicitly preserves the petitioner's right to pursue the civil aspect of the case, despite the dismissal of the criminal charges.

**Case Law:**

*   **Heirs of Federico C. Delgado and Annalisa Pesico v. Luisito Q. Gonzalez and Antonio T. Buenaflor, G.R. No. 184337, August 7, 2009:**  Reiterates the OSG's exclusive right to represent the government in legal proceedings.
*   **People v. Santiago, G.R. No. 80778, June 20, 1989, 174 SCRA 143:** Affirmed the OSG as the sole entity that can bring or defend actions on behalf of the State in criminal proceedings.
*   **Rodriguez v. Gadiane, G.R. No. 152903, July 17, 2006, 495 SCRA 368:** A private complainant may not take an appeal if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal and such appeal on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General.
*   **Merciales v. Court of Appeals, 429 Phil. 70 (2002):** States that there may be rare occasions when the offended party may be allowed to pursue the criminal action on his own behalf, as when there is a denial of due process.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of Rule 112, Section 6(a), regarding the RTC's power to assess probable cause after the DOJ has already determined its existence.  The petitioner argued that this section only applies to the issuance of warrants, not the determination of whether to file charges. The Court rejects this argument.
*   The exception to the OSG's exclusive representation in criminal proceedings; whether the petitioner's situation constitutes such an exception and whether there was a denial of due process is contentious.

**Potential Issues for Future Litigation:**

*   The scope of the civil action (should the petitioner proceed) and whether it will be barred by *res judicata* or collateral estoppel based on the prior criminal proceedings.
*   The actual evidentiary basis for the RTC's finding of a lack of probable cause, particularly whether it properly considered the DOJ's resolutions.
*   Whether the alleged defects in the Information (failure to allege intent to gain) can be cured in a subsequent Information or amended complaint for civil damages.
