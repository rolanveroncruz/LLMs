Here's a legal summary of the provided Philippine Supreme Court decision:

**Case:** *ACI Philippines, Inc. v. Editha C. Coquia* (G.R. No. 174466, July 14, 2008)

**Issue:**  Dispute over a contract for the sale of flint cullets, specifically regarding the applicable price, quantity, and the existence of a contract of adhesion.

**Facts:** ACI Philippines (petitioner) initially contracted with Editha Coquia (respondent) via Purchase Order (PO) No. 106211 for 2,500-3,000 metric tons of flint cullets at P4.20/kilo.  ACI later demanded a price reduction, and issued a superseding PO No. 106373 at P3.65/kilo. ACI then refused to pay even at the reduced price, demanding a further reduction. Coquia sued for specific performance and damages. The lower courts initially ruled in favor of Coquia, ordering ACI to accept remaining deliveries at P4.20/kilo and awarding damages.

**Key Provisions/Clauses:**

*   **Purchase Order No. 106211:** Original agreement specifying quantity and price (P4.20/kilo).
*   **Purchase Order No. 106373:** Supposedly superseded the original PO, reducing the price to P3.65/kilo, but did not specify the quantity.
*   **General Terms:** The standard conditions of the Purchase Orders were not indicative of a "take-it-or-leave-it" Contract of Adhesion. Condition 4 states that any delivery date shall be the essence of any contract arising.

**Legal Analysis & Holding:**

*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts, finding that the POs were *not* contracts of adhesion. The Court emphasized that Coquia, an experienced businesswoman, actively sought the contract and demonstrably understood the terms.  The burden of proving that it was a Contract of Adhesion lies with the party claiming it.
*   **Novation:** The Supreme Court held that PO No. 106373 *did* novate (replace) the original contract (PO No. 106211). By acquiescing to the new PO and delivering under its terms, Coquia implicitly agreed to the modified terms (specifically, the lack of a defined quantity). [Article 1292, Civil Code] requires novation to be unequivocal or incompatible.
*   **Parol Evidence Rule:** While the court acknowledged the parol evidence rule, it cited the exception that allows extrinsic evidence to demonstrate a failure of the written agreement to express the true intent of the parties, when it is raised in a pleading [Rule 130, Section 9 of the Rules of Court]. The Court considered evidence that ACI's urgency for the materials influenced the original agreement.
*   **Damages:** The award of damages was overturned due to a lack of sufficient evidence substantiating Coquia's alleged losses.  [Cite *Premiere Development Bank v. Court of Appeals* for requirement of "competent proof and the best evidence obtainable"].
*   **Article 21, Civil Code:** Inapplicable as it involves a pre-existing contractual relation.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   ACI was obligated to pay for deliveries accepted under PO 106211 at the agreed price.
*   After the issuance of PO 106373, ACI's obligation to accept future deliveries to fulfill the original 2,500-3,000 metric tons was extinguished.
*   Coquia was not entitled to damages because she did not present sufficient evidence to substantiate her claim.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Proof of Duress:** Coquia claimed she agreed to the price reduction in PO 106373 under duress, but this was not sufficiently proven. This argument could have potentially voided the novation, but the Court rejected it.
*   **Interpretation of "Open PO":** The term "open PO" (referring to PO 106373) could be considered ambiguous, potentially leading to arguments about the implied quantity. However, the Court found that Coquia implicitly accepted that subsequent deliveries were not meant to complete the original contract.
*   **Continued Juridical Personality of ACI:** ACI's corporate name change to Asia Pacific Insulation Corporation could raise issues of corporate identity, but the Court noted that ACI's juridical personality subsists despite the change.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1292, Civil Code:** Novation of obligations.
*   **Article 21, Civil Code:** Human relations and the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* (contracts must be kept).
*   **Section 9, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:** Exception to Parol Evidence Rule.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Gulf Resorts, Inc. v. Philippine Charter Insurance Corporation:* Regarding the evaluation of allegations of blind adherence to contracts and the Contract of Adhesion.
*   *Sabio v. The International Corporate Bank, Inc.:* Written document is the best evidence.
*   *Premiere Development Bank v. Court of Appeals:* Regarding the standard of proof for actual damages.
*   *GF Equity, Inc. v. Valenzona; Far East Bank and Trust Company v. Court of Appeals:* Regarding Article 21 of the Civil Code.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court sided with ACI, reversing the lower courts and dismissing Coquia's complaint. The key takeaways are the rejection of the contract of adhesion argument, the recognition of novation through the subsequent Purchase Order, the insufficient evidence to support the damages claim, and the Court's reliance on commercial practice and the parties' conduct to interpret the agreement. The decision emphasizes the importance of clear and unambiguous contract terms.
