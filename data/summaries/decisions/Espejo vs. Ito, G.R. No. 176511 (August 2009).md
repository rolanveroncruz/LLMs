**Case:** *Spouses Espejo v. Ito*, G.R. No. 176511 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' dismissal of a Petition for Review of an RTC decision reversing a MeTC decision in an unlawful detainer case.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Dispute over possession of Apartment Unit No. 9197-B, Catmon St., San Antonio Village, Makati City (subject property).
*   **Claim of Ownership:** Petitioners (Spouses Espejo) claim ownership via a *Donation of Real Property Inter Vivos* from Obdulia's mother, Teodora Gana Vda. de Hemedes.
*   **Unlawful Detainer Action:** Petitioners filed an unlawful detainer case against Respondent (Ito) alleging failure to pay rent.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Respondent claims to be leasing from Rogelio G. Hemedes (Obdulia's brother) based on a lease agreement, not from the Petitioners.  Rogelio is allegedly Teodora's heir through a last will and testament.  There are pending cases regarding the ownership of the subject property.
*   **MeTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of Petitioners, ordering Respondent to vacate and pay back rentals based on Petitioners' TCTs.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Reversed the MeTC, holding that no unlawful detainer exists as there was no contractual relationship (express or implied) between the Petitioners and Respondent as lessors and lessees.
*   **CA Dismissal:** Dismissed Petitioners' Petition for Review for failure to attach the Complaint for Unlawful Detainer to the Petition for Review, violating Rule 42, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.
*   **SC Ruling:** Reversed the CA decision, holding that the CA should not have put premium on technicalities. The court held that the rules of procedure should be relaxed to promote substantial justice, particularly since Petitioners rectified the omission by submitting the complaint with their motion for reconsideration.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Respondent's obligation:** Respondent has been ordered to pay petitioners the amount of TEN THOUSAND PESOS (P10,000.00) per month from date of demand on June 08, 2004 until [respondent] vacates the subject premises as compensation for the use and occupancy of the subject premises, plus attorney's fees in the amount of P10, 000.00 and costs of suit

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** The underlying ownership of the property is heavily disputed, involving a *Donation Inter Vivos* contested by other heirs through probate proceedings and a separate quieting of title action. This significantly impacts the lessors right to eject the lessee.
*   **Conflicting Claims:** There are conflicting claims as to whether the Respondent is leasing from the Petitioners or from Rogelio Hemedes. The Respondent had a valid lease agreement. The existence of a lease agreement with another party undermines the unlawful detainer case against Ito.
*   **Criminal Conviction:** The RTC convicted the Petitioners of estafa through falsification related to the *Donation Inter Vivos* (Criminal Case No. 05-768), although this conviction is pending appeal. If this conviction is upheld, it will undermine their claim of ownership.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 42, Sections 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding the requirements for Petitions for Review and the effect of non-compliance.
*   **Rule 70, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court:** Pertaining to Unlawful Detainer
*   **Case Law:** Cites cases emphasizing that appeal is a statutory right, but procedural rules should be liberally construed to achieve substantial justice (e.g., *Pe√±oso v. Dona*, *Spouses Lanaria v. Planta*).

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The validity and effect of the *Donation Inter Vivos* is the central contentious issue because it is fundamental to determine the ownership.
*   The determination of the lessor, whether the petitioners or Rogelio Hemedes.
*   The procedural lapse was failure to attach the Complaint for Unlawful Detainer, an argument for procedural technicality vs. substantive justice.
