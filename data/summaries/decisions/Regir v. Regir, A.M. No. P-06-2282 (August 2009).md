**Legal Document Summary: *Lolita S. Regir vs. Joel T. Regir*, A.M. No. P-06-2282**

**Nature:** Administrative case against a process server, Joel T. Regir, for immorality.

**Key Provisions/Allegations:**

*   Complainant, Lolita S. Regir (lawful wife), alleges respondent Joel T. Regir (process server) engaged in an illicit relationship with Vilma Sabinay, fathering a child and cohabitating with her, while married to the complainant. She also claims he stopped providing financial support.

**Respondent's Defense:**

*   Denial of allegations, claiming they stem from unfounded jealousy. He denies fathering a child with Vilma Sabinay and asserts that he only rents a house near his work, going home to his wife on weekends.

**Investigating Judge Findings:**

*   Judge Domael found the allegations of immorality unrebutted, noting the respondent's mere denial. Witnesses are deemed credible.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court found Joel T. Regir **GUILTY** of disgraceful and immoral conduct.
*   Respondent's bare denial is insufficient to outweigh the positive testimonies of the witnesses. The Court emphasized that immorality extends beyond sexual intercourse and includes conduct inconsistent with rectitude, etc.
*   His actions, even if committed outside his judicial duties, are subject to scrutiny, upholding the integrity of the judiciary.
*   Reliance on *People v. Sanchez, et al.* to demonstrate the inadequacy of mere denials in the face of positive testimony.
*   Cited *Court Employees of the MCTC v. Sy* on the definition of immorality beyond sexual acts.
*   Referenced Section 52 A(15) of the Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service to justify the penalty.

**Penalty:**

*   Suspension for six (6) months without pay.
*   Stern warning of potential dismissal for continued immoral conduct.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for disgraceful and immoral conduct, leading to suspension.
*   Potential for future dismissal if the conduct continues.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Evidentiary Standard:** The case hinges on "substantial evidence," a lower standard than "proof beyond a reasonable doubt" required in criminal cases.
*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Immorality":** The definition of immorality is broad and open to interpretation, potentially leading to inconsistencies in future applications.
*   **Witness Credibility:** While the Investigating Judge deemed witnesses credible, challenges could be made regarding bias or motive, although this appears unlikely given the SC's reliance on the findings.

**Statutory References:**

*   Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, specifically Section 52 A(15) regarding penalties for disgraceful and immoral conduct.
