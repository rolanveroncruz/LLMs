Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case Name:** *Makati Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Hon. Wilfredo D. Reyes, et al.* G.R. No. 167403, August 6, 2008.

**Summary:**
This case involves a Petition for Review of the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's dismissal of Makati Insurance's (Petitioner) Notice of Appeal as filed out of time. The underlying case was a Complaint filed by Petitioner against Rubills International, Tong Woon Shipping, and Asian Terminals, Inc. (Respondents) for damages arising from an alleged breach of contract of carriage, seeking to recover P412,253.91, based on subrogation rights due to losses/damages sustained by the shipment of the consignee-assured.  The RTC dismissed the case without prejudice due to Petitioner's counsel's failure to appear at pre-trial conferences.

**Key Provisions & Procedural History:**

*   **Initial Dismissal:** RTC dismissed the original case *without prejudice* under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court (failure to prosecute).
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.
*   **Notice of Appeal:** Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal, which was dismissed by the RTC for being filed three days late based on an incorrect computation of the appeal period.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's dismissal, holding that the Notice of Appeal was improperly filed, as the remedy for dismissal without prejudice is a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65, or refiling the case.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:** The Supreme Court denied the petition but applied the "fresh period rule" established in *Neypes v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 141524, September 14, 2005, to determine that the notice of appeal was timely filed. However, it also upheld the dismissal, reasoning that a Notice of Appeal was not the appropriate remedy and that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to the dismissal of the case considering the multiple delays in the pre-trial conferences, implying the petitioner's lack of interest to prosecute.
*   **Rule 41, Section 1(h), of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure** states that no appeal may be taken from an order dismissing an action without prejudice.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Plaintiffs Duty to prosecute:** There is a duty on the part of the Plaintiff to prosecute cases with due diligence to expedite the process.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Dismissal Without Prejudice:** A dismissal "without prejudice" does not prevent refiling of the case. The petitioner can refile the case, subject to any applicable statute of limitations.
*   **Wrong Remedy:** The key procedural risk was pursuing an appeal instead of a Rule 65 petition for certiorari concerning the dismissal without prejudice.
*   **Application of *Neypes* Rule:**  The *Neypes* ruling regarding the "fresh period rule" clarifies the appeal period calculation from the denial of a motion for reconsideration but did not save this appeal because an appeal was the wrong remedy.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 17, Section 3 (dismissal for failure to prosecute); Rule 41, Section 1(h) (non-appealable orders); Rule 65 (certiorari); Rule 41, Section 3 (period to appeal); Rule 22 (Computation of time).
*   ***Neypes v. Court of Appeals***, G.R. No. 141524, September 14, 2005 (establishes the "fresh period rule").
*   ***Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, Section 39***Shortened the appeal period from 30 days to 15 days to hasten the disposition of cases.

**Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   Whether a notice of appeal was the proper remedy for an order of dismissal without prejudice.
*   Whether the "fresh period rule" applies retroactively to actions pending at the time of its promulgation, which the court affirmed in this case.

**Conclusion:**
The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the case. While recognizing the timeliness of the filed Notice of Appeal due to the Neypes ruling, the Supreme Court reiterated the procedural defect in pursuing this remedy as an order of dismissal without prejudice may only be subject of a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended by the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. This underscores the importance of selecting the correct procedural remedies and the courts' inherent power to manage their dockets to ensure the efficient administration of justice. The case suggests potential exposure for the petitioner if the statute of limitations has run and the case cannot be refiled.
