## Legal Document Summary: *Office of the Ombudsman v. De Sahagun, et al.*, G.R. No. 167982

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision that overturned the Ombudsman's Orders finding the Respondents administratively liable for Simple Misconduct.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Respondents (De Sahagun, Waquiz, and Bassig) were members of the Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) of the Intramuros Administration. They were involved in awarding contracts to Brand Asia, Ltd. for video documentary and print collaterals production *without* the required public bidding, violating Executive Order No. 301.
*   **Initial Complaint & Investigation:**  An anonymous complaint was filed with the Presidential Commission Against Graft and Corruption (PGAC) against then Administrator Edda V. Henson and was dismissed.  Later an anonymous complaint was filed with the Ombudsman. After an investigation, the Ombudsman initially found the Respondents guilty of Grave Misconduct, later reduced to Simple Misconduct, and suspended them for six months. The criminal case was dismissed for lack of probable cause.
*   **CA Decision:** The CA reversed the Ombudsman's ruling, citing two grounds:
    *   **Prescription:** The complaint was filed more than one year after the acts complained of, allegedly violating Section 20(5) of R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act).
    *   **Lack of Authority:**  The Ombudsman's power is purely recommendatory, not punitive, citing *Tapiador v. Office of the Ombudsman*.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, reinstating the Ombudsman's Order finding respondents guilty of simple misconduct.

**Key Issues & Legal Analysis:**

1.  **Prescription of Administrative Offenses:**  The SC held that administrative offenses do *not* prescribe.  Section 20(5) of R.A. No. 6770 is *directory*, granting the Ombudsman discretion to investigate even if the complaint is filed more than one year after the act.  The Court cited *Melchor v. Gironella* and *Filipino v. Macabuhay*. The decision also mentioned Administrative Order No. 17 which amended Administrative Order No. 07.
2.  **Ombudsman's Authority:**  The SC affirmed the Ombudsman's authority to directly impose administrative sanctions, rejecting the CA's reliance on *Tapiador*.  The Court clarified that *Tapiador's* statement was *obiter dictum* and that R.A. No. 6770 grants the Ombudsman the power to impose penalties, including removal and suspension, citing *Ledesma v. Court of Appeals* and *Estarija v. Ranada*.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6770 (The Ombudsman Act of 1989), Section 20(5):** Addressed the issue of prescription, ultimately interpreted as directory rather than mandatory.
*   **Executive Order No. 301:** Governs public bidding requirements, relevant to the underlying misconduct (avoiding public bidding).
*   **R.A. No. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), Section 3(a) and 3(c)**
*   ***Tapiador v. Office of the Ombudsman* (429 Phil. 47 (2002)):**  Overruled, clarifying the scope of the Ombudsman's powers.
*   ***Melchor v. Gironella*, G.R. No. 151138, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 476:** Regarding the directory nature of Section 20(5) of RA 6770
*   ***Filipino v. Macabuhay*, G.R. No. 158960, November 24, 2006, 508 SCRA 50:** Regarding the directory nature of Section 20(5) of RA 6770
*   ***Ledesma v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 161629, July 29, 2005, 465 SCRA 437:** Clarifying Ombudsman's powers and overruling the misinterpretation of *Tapiador*.
*   ***Estarija v. Ranada*, G.R. No. 159314, June 26, 2006, 492 SCRA 652:** Affirmed the Ombudsman's power to impose administrative sanctions.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Enforcement of Suspension:**  Respondents may face difficulty if the six-month suspension is enforced years after the initial finding.
*   **Prejudicial Publicity:**  Reinstatement of the Ombudsman's finding could negatively impact Respondents' reputations.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "may not" in Section 20(5) of R.A. No. 6770 was contentious. The CA argued it was mandatory (prohibiting investigation after one year), but the SC interpreted it as directory.
