**Legal Document Summary: *Re: Dropping from the Rolls of Ms. Marissa M. Nudo***

**Case:** A.M. No. 17-08-191-RTC

**Court:** Supreme Court, Second Division

**Date:** February 7, 2018

**Nature of Document:** Resolution regarding the administrative matter of dropping Ms. Marissa M. Nudo, Clerk III, from the rolls due to Absence Without Official Leave (AWOL).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** Ms. Nudo is DROPPED from the rolls effective March 1, 2017.
*   **Grounds:** Continuous absence without approved leave for more than thirty (30) working days, violating Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, as amended by Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2007.
*   **Vacancy:** Her position as Clerk III is declared VACANT.
*   **Benefits & Reemployment:** Nudo is still qualified to receive benefits she is entitled to under existing laws and may be reemployed in the government.
*   **Service of Resolution:** Copy of Resolution to be served upon her at her address of record.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Neglect of Duty:** Nudo grossly disregarded and neglected the duties of her office, failing to adhere to high standards of public accountability.
*   **Disruption of Public Service:** Her prolonged unauthorized absences caused inefficiency in public service.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Dropping from Rolls:** While the decision appears straightforward, a potential risk exists if Nudo can demonstrate extenuating circumstances for her absence (e.g., documented illness, family emergency) that were not properly considered. However, based on the facts presented, the court was not made aware of such circumstances.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave:** Central to the decision, defining the consequences of AWOL.
*   **Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2007:** Amends the Omnibus Rules on Leave.
*   **Other Cases Cited:** *Re: Dropping from the Rolls of Rowie A. Quimno, A.M. No. 17-03-33-MCTC, April 17, 2017* and *Re: AWOL of Ms. Fernandita B. Borja, 549 Phil. 533, 536 (2007)* cited in relation to inefficiency in public service due to AWOL.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The resolution does not elaborate on attempts (if any) by the RTC or OCA to contact Nudo prior to the decision. This could be a point of contention if Nudo argues lack of due process.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the dropping of Ms. Nudo from the rolls due to extended AWOL, relying on the provisions of the Omnibus Rules on Leave. The decision highlights the employee's neglect of duty and the disruption caused to public service. While the decision seems conclusive, potential challenges could arise if Nudo can present a valid justification for her absence or demonstrate a lack of due process. The fact that her benefits are still provided for, suggests the issue is non-disciplinary and can be remedied upon her return to the judiciary or any other government agency.
