**Case Summary: Eversley Childs Sanitarium v. Spouses Barbarona, G.R. No. 195814 (2018)**

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision in a Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals decision regarding an ejectment case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Eversley Childs Sanitarium (represented by Chief of Sanitarium)
*   **Respondents:** Spouses Anastacio and Perla Barbarona

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

1.  **Nature of Action (Ejectment vs. Accion Publiciana):** The central issue is whether the Spouses Barbarona's complaint against Eversley constituted an action for unlawful detainer or an accion publiciana. The Court held that the complaint was improperly filed as an unlawful detainer because the Barbaronas failed to adequately plead and prove prior possession by tolerance on their part or their predecessors. The complaint alleged illegal occupation from the start, indicating that the proper remedy would have been an accion publiciana or reivindicatoria. Cites *Carbonilla v. Abiera*, 639 Phil. 473 (2010) to emphasize the necessity of establishing overt acts of tolerance when claiming possession by mere tolerance.

2.  **Validity of Title:** The Court addressed the effect of the cancellation of TCT No. 53698, the Barbaronas' title. The CA had affirmed the lower courts based on the validity of Decree No. 699021 (predecessor's title) despite the cancellation. The Supreme Court held that without TCT No. 53698, the Barbaronas lacked sufficient proof to support their claim. Note: Torrens title does not vest ownership, but provides documentation. The Court pointed out that a certificate of title is always subject to the law.

3.  **Possession of Eversley Childs Sanitarium:** Eversley has occupied the property since 1930. The Court noted that Proclamation No. 507 reserved portions of the property for the Sanitariumâ€™s use as a leprosarium. This predates Decree No. 699021. The Court found that Eversley cannot be considered as occupying under mere tolerance of the registered owner since its occupation was by virtue of law.

4.  **Forum Shopping:** The Court initially addressed a procedural question regarding forum shopping. While the OSG erroneously filed a motion to withdraw instead of merely declaring abandonment per I.R.C.A., the Court excused the mistake, noting the I.R.C.A. should have triggered the abandonment regardless.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Barbarona:** Failed to properly file and prove an unlawful detainer case and lacked sufficient evidence to prove conveyance of property from their predecessors. They were not able to dispossess Eversley of the property.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Ownership Dispute:** The decision emphasizes that ownership remains unresolved. The Barbaronas still possess a claim based on Decree No. 699021, but must pursue the proper action (accion publiciana or reivindicatoria). Eversley also has a competing claim based on Proclamation No. 507.
*   **Government Action:** The State, being a party through the Sanitarium, could initiate action to formally secure the Sanitarium's possession in light of the Proclamation.
*   **Future Litigation:** The judgment is without prejudice to the parties litigating the issue of ownership in a separate, appropriate action. The Sanitarium's continued occupation is subject to the final resolution of ownership.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 7, Section 5, Rules of Court:** Certification against forum shopping.
*   **Rule VI, Section 15, 2002 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals:** Effect of Filing an Appeal in the Supreme Court.
*   ***City of Taguig v. City of Makati*, G.R. No. 208393 (2016):** Definition of forum shopping.
*   ***Carbonilla v. Abiera*, 639 Phil. 473 (2010):** Requisites for unlawful detainer action, acts of tolerance must be proved.
*   ***Co v. Militar*, 466 Phil. 217 (2004):** Issue for resolution in an unlawful detainer case.
*   **Proclamation No. 507:** Reserve portions of the property specifically for petitioner's use as a leprosarium.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, finding that the ejectment case was improperly filed. The Barbaronas must pursue either an accion publiciana or reivindicatoria to assert their rights, if any, while Eversley Childs Sanitarium remains in possession pending final determination of ownership.
