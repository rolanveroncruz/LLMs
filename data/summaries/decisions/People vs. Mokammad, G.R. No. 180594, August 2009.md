## Legal Document Summary: People v. Mokammad, G.R. No. 180594

**Case:** Appeal of CA decision affirming RTC conviction of Ismael and Cairoden Mokammad for murder and three counts of frustrated murder.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Facts:** Appellants were positively identified by surviving victims as perpetrators of an ambush that resulted in one death (Olomoddin Abbas) and injuries to three others (Hadji Nasser Kasim Amerol, Calauto Radiamoda Kamid, and Mizangkad Atal Hadji Yusoph).
*   **Charge:** Complex crime of murder with frustrated murder (duplicitous). Ultimately treated as separate crimes due to failure to timely object to the information.
*   **Defense:** Alibi (denied by appellants), corroborated by family and neighbors. Alibi rejected due to positive identification, lack of physical impossibility, and potential bias of corroborating witnesses.
*   **Treachery:** Found to be a qualifying circumstance, elevating the killing to murder. The victims were unarmed and unaware of the impending danger, leaving them unable to defend themselves.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Appellants are liable for **murder** of Olomoddin Abbas (Art. 248 RPC).
*   Appellants are liable for **three counts of frustrated murder** of Hadji Nasser Kasim Amerol, Calauto Radiamoda Kamid, and Mizangkad Atal Hadji Yusoph (Art. 248, Art. 6 in relation to Art. 61 RPC).
*   Appellants are jointly and severally liable for **civil indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and exemplary damages** to the heirs of the deceased and the surviving victims.

**Penalties:**

*   **Murder:** Reclusion Perpetua
*   **Frustrated Murder:** Indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* (based on Art. 61(2) RPC and Indeterminate Sentence Law).

**Damages (Joint & Several Liability):**

*   **Heirs of Olomoddin Abbas:**
    *   Civil Indemnity: P50,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00
    *   Temperate Damages: P25,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P30,000.00
*   **Each surviving victim:**
    *   Temperate Damages: P25,000.00
    *   Moral Damages: P40,000.00
    *   Exemplary Damages: P20,000.00

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Duplicitous Information:** Although waived, the original charge was for a complex crime when separate informations should have been filed.  This could have raised issues regarding due process and double jeopardy if properly challenged.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence & Identification:** Reliance on eyewitness testimony in a surprise attack can be subject to scrutiny. Appellants challenged the credibility and possibility of accurate identification.
*   **Damages Award:** The increase in damages by the Supreme Court, specifically the addition of temperate damages in the absence of documented actual damages, is a point of interest regarding the application of remedies.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code (RPC): Art. 6, Art. 48, Art. 61, Art. 63, Art. 248
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law
