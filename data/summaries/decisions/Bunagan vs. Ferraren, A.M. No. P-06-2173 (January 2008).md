**Case Summary: *Bunagan v. Ferraren*, A.M. No. P-06-2173, January 28, 2008**

**Facts:** Sally Bunagan filed a complaint against Sheriff Joel Ferraren for dereliction of duty, serious misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, stemming from delays and irregularities in the implementation of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. 04-547. Specifically, Bunagan alleged that Ferraren delayed execution, requested and received unauthorized payments, and failed to submit a timely or proper return.

**Key Provisions and Violations:**

*   **Unauthorized Collection of Fees (Violation of Rule 141, Section 10):** Ferraren directly solicited and received P4,000 from Bunagan for implementation expenses *prior* to court approval of the estimated expenses. This violates the established procedure requiring prior court approval and deposit of funds with the Clerk of Court. *See Cobarrubias v. Apostol, A.M. No. P-02-1612, January 31, 2006; Tan v. Paredes, A.M. No. P-04-1789, July 22, 2005; De Guzman, Jr., v. Mendoza, A.M. No. P-03-1693, March 17, 2005.*
*   **Delayed Implementation:** The writ of execution issued on April 20, 2005, was only implemented on September 26, 2005. Ferraren offered justifications for the delay (weather, unavailability of police, pending motions), but the Court found these insufficient.  Such a delay breaches his ministerial duty to execute the writ with reasonable celerity. *See Escobar Vda. De Lopez v. Luna, A.M. No. P-04-1786, February 13, 2006; Buenviaje v. Anatalio, A.M. No. P-00-1361, July 29, 2005.*
*   **Belated Return:** Ferraren filed his return on August 15, 2005, nearly four months after the writ's issuance, violating the requirement to file a return within 30 days. *See Villarico v. Javier, A.M. No. P-04-1828, February 14, 2005.*

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Sheriff's Ministerial Duty:** Sheriffs have a ministerial duty to execute court orders promptly and efficiently.
*   **Adherence to Fee Collection Procedures:** Strict adherence to Rule 141, Section 10 regarding estimated expenses, court approval, and deposit with the Clerk of Court is mandatory. Direct solicitation and receipt of funds from parties is prohibited.
*   **Timely Filing of Returns:** Sheriffs must file returns within 30 days of writ issuance and provide regular updates if the judgment remains unsatisfied.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Complainant's Non-Appearance:** While the Court correctly notes that lack of interest from complainant does not bar disciplinary action, Ferraren raised the issue of his right to cross-examine the complainant.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The court considered Ferraren's length of service (21 years) and lack of prior administrative offenses as mitigating factors in determining the penalty, but the potential for a harsher penalty existed, based on precedent cases.
*   **Ambiguity Regarding Justifications for Delay:** The Court generally rejected Ferraren's justifications for delay, highlighting the importance of diligently pursuing execution even in the face of challenges.

**Outcome:** Ferraren was found GUILTY of dereliction of duty, serious misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service and SUSPENDED for three (3) months and one (1) day without pay, with a stern warning.

**Applicable Law:**

*   Rule 141, Section 10 of the Rules of Court (Sheriff's Fees) - *note this was Section 9 prior to 2004 amendment*.
*   Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Rule IV, Section 52 A (1), (2), and (20) (Penalties for Grave Misconduct, Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service).

This case underscores the strict requirements placed on sheriffs in executing court orders and the serious consequences of non-compliance, particularly regarding unauthorized fee collection and undue delay. It also reinforces the principle that administrative cases can proceed even without the complainant's active participation.
