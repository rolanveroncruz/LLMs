Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the provided document:

**Case:** *Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company (MBTC) vs. Fortuna Paper Mill & Packaging Corporation (Fortuna)*, G.R. No. 190800, November 7, 2018.

**Subject Matter:** Corporate Rehabilitation under the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation.

**Issue:** Did the Court of Appeals (CA) err in affirming the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) approval of Fortuna's Rehabilitation Plan?  The key sub-issues are:

1.  Whether Fortuna, as a debtor already in default, was qualified to file for corporate rehabilitation under the Interim Rules.
2.  Whether the Rehabilitation Plan met the minimum requirements of the Interim Rules, specifically regarding material financial commitments and a liquidation analysis.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court (SC) dismissed the petition as moot and academic due to the RTC's (affirmed by the CA) subsequent termination of the rehabilitation proceedings. However, the SC still ruled on the merits. The SC determined that Fortune can file for corporate rehabilitation, but that its Rehabilitation Plan was not viable.

**Key Provisions and Arguments:**

*   **Section 1, Rule 4, Interim Rules:** Concerns eligibility for corporate rehabilitation. MBTC argued it only applies to debtors who *foresee* inability to pay, not those already in default.
*   **SC Rejection of MBTC's Interpretation:** Citing *Philippine Bank of Communications v. Basic Polyprinters and Packaging Corporation*, the SC held that insolvency/default does not disqualify a company from filing for rehabilitation. The trigger is the *inability to pay* debts as they fall due, regardless of whether they are already mature.  The SC also cited *Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Liberty Corrugated Boxes Manufacturing Corporation* applying the doctrine of *stare decisis*.
*   **Section 5, Rule 4, Interim Rules:** Requires a Rehabilitation Plan to include "material financial commitments."
*   **Lack of Material Financial Commitment:** The SC found that Fortuna's plan relied on speculative investment from Polycity Enterprises Ltd.  Polycity's letter of intent was non-binding and contingent on due diligence. Citing *Phil. Asset Growth Two, Inc., et al. v. Fastech Synergy Phils., Inc., et al.*, the SC emphasized that mere proposals do not meet the standard of "legally binding investment commitments" required by case law to justify approval of a rehabilitation plan.  The plan also speculatively relied on a real estate venture dependent on external factors (government flood control projects, Pag-IBIG participation).
*   **Inadequate Liquidation Analysis:** The SC found the Rehabilitation Plan to lack the proper liquidation analysis needed, which estimates the proportion of the claims that the creditors and shareholders would receive if the debtor's properties were liquidated.
*   **Feasibility:** Citing *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Sarahia Manor Hotel Corporation*, and *Phil. Asset Growth Two, Inc., et al. v. Fastech Synergy Phils., Inc., et al.*, the SC ruled that the test for feasibility in evaluating a plan was lacking, and emphasized that the rationale of corporate rehabilitation to benefit creditors, owners and the economy was abused.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Non-Binding Agreements:**  The core weakness of Fortuna's plan was reliance on contingencies (investment, real estate development).  The lack of firm commitments left creditors exposed.
*   **Financial Data Omissions:**  The concurring opinion pointed out inconsistencies and omissions in Fortuna's financial statements, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the information presented to the court.
*   **Abuse of Rehabilitation Process:** The SC acknowledged the risk of companies using rehabilitation solely to delay creditors' rights enforcement. The failed promises and lack of tangible progress by Fortuna highlighted this risk.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC):** The primary governing rules for the case. Specifically, Rule 4, Sections 1 and 5.
*   **Republic Act No. 10142:** or the Financial Rehabilitation and Insolvency Act of 2010
*   ***Philippine Bank of Communications v. Basic Polyprinters and Packaging Corporation*, 745 Phil. 651 (2014):**  Cited to establish that companies in default can still file for rehabilitation.
*   ***Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company v. Liberty Corrugated Boxes Manufacturing Corporation*, 804 Phil. 195 (2017):** Applying *stare decisis* to address eligibility of defaulting debtor.
*   ***Phil. Asset Growth Two, Inc., et al. v. Fastech Synergy Phils., Inc., et al.*, 788 Phil. 355 (2016):** Cited for standards of feasible rehabilitation plans.
*   ***Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Sarahia Manor Hotel Corporation*, 715 Phil. 420 (2013):** Cited for the test in evaluating the feasibility of a plan.
*   **Viva Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Keppel Phils. Marine, Inc., et al.**, 781 Phil. 95 (2016): Court emphasized the definition of corporate rehabilitation and for the creditors.

**Conclusion:**

While the case was dismissed as moot, the SC's ruling clarifies that being in default isn't an automatic bar to corporate rehabilitation.  However, the SC strongly emphasized the importance of demonstrating a *feasible* plan with *genuine* financial commitments.  The Court highlighted that the rehabilitation process should not be used to unfairly delay creditors' rights and must be based on verifiable financial data. The decision serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of relying on speculative proposals and the need for robust due diligence in corporate rehabilitation cases.
