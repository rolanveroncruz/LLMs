**Case Summary: People v. Bracia, G.R. No. 174477, October 2, 2009**

**Facts:**

Renato Bracia was convicted of murder by the RTC and CA for the death of Restituto Barcebal, Jr. The prosecution presented an eyewitness, Edgar Constantino, who testified to seeing Bracia and Bercasio (deceased) hacking the victim. Bracia claimed self-defense, alleging the victim attacked him first with a wooden pole.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Crime:** Murder, under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Elements:**
    *   The Court considered the qualifying circumstances of **Treachery**, and **Abuse of superior strength**.
    *   Rejected Bracia's claim of self-defense due to:
        *   Failure to prove unlawful aggression by the victim.
        *   Disproportionate means of defense given the extent of the victim's injuries (21 external, 5 internal wounds).
        *   Multiple weapons were used by multiple people.
*   **Witness Credibility:** Edgar Constantino's eyewitness testimony was deemed credible. The RTC's assessment of witness credibility was upheld as no significant facts were overlooked.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant Renato Bracia:**
    *   Criminal Liability: Reclusion Perpetua.
    *   Civil Liability:
        *   Civil Indemnity: Increased to P75,000.00.
        *   Actual Damages: Reduced to P29,320.00 (amount supported by receipts).
        *   Exemplary Damages: P25,000.00 due to treachery.
        *   Loss of Earning Capacity: P1,020,000.00 (based on formula and the victim's income as a farmer administrator).
        *   Moral Damages: P50,000.00.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense Claim:** Bracia's self-defense argument hinges on his testimony alone, with no corroborating evidence. The sheer number and severity of wounds contradict a reasonable self-defense scenario. This poses a significant hurdle for any appeal based on this ground.
*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** While the court found Edgar credible, the defense challenged his testimony as "incredible and inconsistent." A potential appellate strategy could focus on discrepancies in Edgar's statements, however, given the lack of alternative explanations the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court found it sufficient.
*   **Evident Premeditation:** Although alleged in the Information, this was not proven, which is beneficial to Bracia as it could have increased the sentence.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Murder.
*   **Article 11(1) of the Revised Penal Code:** Spells out the elements of Self-Defense.
*   **People v. Mateo:** Intermediate review by the CA required due to the severity of the sentence.

*    **People v. Cawaling:** Regarding moral damages.

**Analysis & Advice:**

The conviction is well-supported by the eyewitness testimony and the overwhelming evidence against the self-defense claim. An appeal based solely on challenging witness credibility or re-arguing self-defense is unlikely to succeed.
