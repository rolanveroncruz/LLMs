**Case:** *Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. v. Court of Appeals and Lavine Loungewear Mfg. Corp.*, G.R. No. 119571, March 11, 1998.

**Summary:**

This case involves a claim for damages arising from a delay in the shipment of goods from Manila to Le Havre, France. The central issue is whether the claim is subject to the one-year prescriptive period under Section 3(6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA). The Supreme Court ultimately held that the delay, which allegedly resulted in a reduction in the value of the goods due to arriving in the "off season," did not constitute "loss or damage" as contemplated under COGSA. Consequently, the applicable prescriptive period is the ten-year period provided in Article 1144 of the Civil Code.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contract of Carriage:** Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (carrier) contracted with Lavine Loungewear (shipper) to transport goods from Manila to Le Havre, France, with a promised delivery within 28 days.
*   **COGSA, Section 3(6):** This section requires suit to be brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered regarding "loss or damage" claims.
*   **Civil Code, Article 1144:** Provides a ten-year prescriptive period for actions upon a written contract.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Carrier Liability:** The carrier's potential liability stems from the delay in delivery, which allegedly caused economic damage to the shipper due to lost sales opportunities.
*   **Prescription:** The core risk involved in whether the claim is time-barred. If COGSA applies, the claim is prescribed; if the Civil Code applies, the claim is timely.
*   **Ambiguity in "Loss or Damage":** The key legal dispute centers on the interpretation of "loss or damage" under COGSA. The SC clarified that "loss" refers to the deterioration or disappearance of goods not simply misdelivery. The court distinguished between damages due to deterioration of the goods during transit versus damages due to other causes independent of the condition of the cargo upon arrival, such as a drop in their market value. The SC determined that the latter is not covered by COGSA's one-year prescription period.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), Section 3(6).**
*   **Civil Code, Article 1144.**
*   ***Ang v. American Steamship Agencies, Inc.*, 19 SCRA 123 (1967) & 19 SCRA 631 (1967):**  This case defined "loss" as the deterioration or disappearance of goods and distinguished it from misdelivery.
*   ***Tan Liao v. American President Lines, Ltd.*, 98 Phil. 203 (1956):** Held that deterioration of goods due to delay constitutes "loss or damage" under COGSA.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Loss or Damage" under COGSA ยง3(6):** The central point of contention. Does the term encompass economic losses resulting from delayed delivery that does not physically affect the goods? The Court interpreted the provision narrowly, excluding economic losses not tied to the physical condition of the goods upon arrival.
