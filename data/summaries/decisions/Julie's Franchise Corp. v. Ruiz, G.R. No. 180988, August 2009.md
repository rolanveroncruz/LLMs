**Case:** *Julie's Franchise Corporation vs. Hon. Chandler O. Ruiz, et al.* (G.R. No. 180988, August 28, 2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging RTC Resolutions in Civil Case No. 6108 (Specific Performance) and seeking to enjoin indirect contempt proceedings in Civil Case No. 6320.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Franchise Agreements:** Dancel (Franchisee) and Julie's Franchise Corporation (Franchisor) entered into three franchise agreements. Renewal fees for the next 5 years of the franchise agreements were paid, but JFC subsequently terminated the agreements due to dissolution of Dancel's partnership with Uy (son-in-law of JFC's trade name originator).

*   **Specific Performance Suit (Civil Case No. 6108):** Dancel sued JFC for specific performance, seeking a preliminary injunction. RTC initially denied the injunction. CA reversed, ordering RTC to issue the injunction. JFC's appeal to SC was denied for late filing, rendering the CA decision final. RTC then issued the Writ of Preliminary Injunction.

*   **Writ of Preliminary Injunction:** The trial court issued a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory and Prohibitory Injunction, directing Julie's Franchise Corporation and its agents, employees and all persons acting for and in its behalf to:
    *   Refrain from terminating the franchise agreements with Dancel
    *   Deliver supplies for operation of the bakeshops
    *   Allow Dancel to use the trade name "Julie's Bakeshop," all signages, packaging materials, and other paraphernalia connected therewith and to advertise himself as a franchisee of JFC.

*   **Indirect Contempt (Civil Case No. 6320):** Dancel filed indirect contempt charges against JFC for violation of the preliminary injunction.

**Issues Raised by JFC:**

1.  **Jurisdiction:** Whether Judge Ruiz acted without jurisdiction in issuing an injunction against acts committed outside the court's territorial boundaries.
2.  **Grave Abuse of Discretion:**
    *   Extending expired franchise contracts by granting the injunction.
    *   Prejudging the case by granting the injunction.
    *   Not voluntarily inhibiting due to prejudgment.
    *   Not dismissing the case on summary judgment due to judicial admissions and lack of cause of action.
    *   Granting the injunction despite the absence of a right in esse.
    *   Not granting JFC a preliminary injunction to protect its intellectual property rights.
3.  **Enjoining Contempt:** Whether the indirect contempt charge can be enjoined.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court dismissed the petition.
*   **Certiorari Scope:** Certiorari is limited to correcting errors of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion, not errors of judgment.
*   **Finality of CA Decision:** The CA decision ordering the issuance of the preliminary injunction was final and executory, binding on the RTC. Relitigation of issues already decided with finality is not permitted.
*   **Errors of Judgment vs. Jurisdiction:** Arguments regarding summary judgment and JFC's intellectual property rights are errors of judgment, not jurisdiction, and thus not reviewable via certiorari.
*   **Separate Case:** The issue of indirect contempt involves a separate case in another branch of the RTC and should have been raised in a separate petition for prohibition.

**Potential Risks & Concerns:**

*   **Enforcement of Injunction:** JFC faces ongoing enforcement of the preliminary injunction, potentially requiring it to continue supplying Dancel's bakeshops and allowing use of its trade name.

*   **Contempt Proceedings:** JFC remains subject to indirect contempt proceedings, which could result in fines or imprisonment if it violates the injunction.

*   **Intellectual Property Rights:** JFC alleges its intellectual property rights are being infringed, but the court deemed this an error of judgment not reviewable by certiorari. JFC might need to pursue separate actions to protect its IP.

*   **Contract Interpretation:** The underlying issue of whether the franchise agreements were validly terminated remains unresolved on the merits, and may have to proceed to trial.

**Key Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Certiorari and Prohibition)
*   *People v. Romualdez*, G.R. No. 166510, 23 July 2008, 559 SCRA 492
*   *People v. Court of Appeals*, G.R. No. 144332, 10 June 2004, 431 SCRA 610

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary contentious issue is whether the termination of the franchise agreements was valid, particularly in light of the pre-payment of renewal fees. This revolves around the interpretation of the franchise agreements and applicable contract law.
