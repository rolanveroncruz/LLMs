Okay, here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *People of the Philippines v. Jayson Bombio y De Villa*, G.R. No. 234291, October 3, 2018 (841 Phil. 457)

**Holding:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision and acquitted Jayson Bombio of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs (violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002").

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sec. 5, R.A. 9165 (Illegal Sale):** Requires proof of (1) the identity of buyer and seller, the object of the sale, and consideration; and (2) delivery and payment.
*   **Sec. 11, R.A. 9165 (Illegal Possession):** Requires proof of (a) possession of dangerous drugs; (b) unauthorized possession; and (c) conscious awareness of possession.
*   **Section 21, R.A. 9165, Prior to Amendment (R.A. 10640):** Mandates specific procedures for seizure and custody of drugs, including:
    *   Immediate physical inventory and photography *at the place of seizure (or nearest police station if warrantless)*.
    *   Presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), a representative from the media, a representative from the DOJ, *and* an elected public official during inventory.
    *   Signatures of these individuals on the inventory.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused (Bombio):**  Potentially subject to life imprisonment and a fine for illegal sale (Sec. 5) and imprisonment of twenty (20) years, plus a fine for illegal possession (Sec. 11).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Breakdown:** The *corpus delicti* was not proven due to a significant break in the chain of custody. The critical issue was the failure to comply with the Section 21 requirements regarding inventory and the presence of required witnesses.
*   **Failure to Comply with Section 21 requirements:** No elected public official or representatives from the DOJ and media were present when the inventory was conducted, as all of them affixed their signatures after the inventory was completed.
*   **Saving Clause Misapplication:** The prosecution improperly invoked the "integrity and evidentiary value preserved" clause of Section 21 without justifying their non-compliance with mandatory procedures.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 5, 11, and 21.** Specifically, *the pre-amendment version of Section 21* (before R.A. No. 10640) applies because the offenses occurred before the amendment.
*   **People v. Relato, 679 Phil. 268 (2012):**  Stresses the importance of proving the *corpus delicti* and avoiding gaps in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):** Emphasizes the insulating presence of media, DOJ, and elected public officials to prevent tampering and maintain the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):** Clarifies that mere invocation of the presumption of regularity is insufficient when there is a gross disregard of procedural safeguards.
*   **People v. Hilario y Diana and Guadayo y Royo, G.R. No. 210610, January 11, 2018:** Reaffirms presumption of innocence.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   **Prosecution's argument** was that the signatures on the Certificate of Inventory sufficed to establish compliance with Section 21. This was rejected by the Supreme Court because the witnesses were not actually present during the inventory process.
*   **Defense's argument** was that the integrity of the chain of custody was compromised due to non-compliance with Section 21 requirements and that the prosecution was not able to adequately establish a chain of custody.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found that the prosecution failed to establish an unbroken chain of custody due to the violation of mandatory procedures outlined in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, specifically the absence of required witnesses during the inventory. This created reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the evidence, leading to Bombio's acquittal. This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases.
