## Legal Document Summary: *Sps. Narvaez vs. Sps. Alciso*, G.R. No. 165907 (2009)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision regarding a property sale with a right to repurchase provision benefiting a third party (Alciso).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Stipulation *Pour Autrui*:** The 1981 Deed of Sale of Realty between Bate and the Narvaez spouses contained a clause stating Bate carried over Alcisoâ€™s intent to buy back the property "at a price under such conditions as the present BUYERS (Spouses Narvaez) may impose." The Court affirms that this constituted a stipulation *pour autrui* in favor of Alciso, granting her the right to repurchase.
*   **Right of Repurchase:** The Court acknowledges that Alciso initially expressed her desire to repurchase but did not make a formal tender of payment within the applicable period. Despite the failure to tender payment, the court applies Article 1606 of the Civil Code, granting Alciso a 30-day period from the finality of this decision to exercise her right of repurchase due to her belief that the original transaction was a mortgage.
*   **Applicability of Article 448:** The Court of Appeals ruled that the Narvaez spouses, as builders in good faith, were entitled to be reimbursed for the building they constructed on the land per Article 448 of the Civil Code. The Supreme Court reverses this application, clarifying that Article 448 does not apply when the landowner is the builder.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Alciso:** Obligated to pay the Spouses Narvaez: (1) the original sale price, (2) expenses of the contract, (3) legitimate payments made because of the sale, and (4) necessary and useful expenses related to the property to redeem it.  Failure to tender these amounts within 30 days of final judgment will result in forfeiture of repurchase rights.
*   **Spouses Narvaez:** Obligated to allow Alciso to repurchase the property if Alciso tenders full payment within 30 days from the finality of the decision. They must provide records of the sale expenses, legitimate payments made related to the sale, and the necessary and useful expenses, including the cost of the building, to the trial court for determination.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Determination of Repurchase Price:** The case is remanded to the RTC to determine the exact amounts for the expenses of the contract, legitimate payments, and necessary and useful expenses. This valuation could be a source of contention.
*   **Interpretation of "Expenses of the Contract" and "Legitimate Payments":**  The definition and scope of these terms are not explicitly defined and could lead to disputes during the RTC valuation process.
*   **Failure to Tender Payment:** Alciso's failure to make a timely tender of payment could be argued to have extinguished her repurchase right, despite the court's invocation of the 30-day period under Article 1606.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Article 1311:** Stipulation *pour autrui* requirements (see *Limitless Potentials, Inc. v. Quilala*).
*   **Civil Code Articles 1601, 1606, and 1616:** Conventional redemption (sale with right to repurchase), time period for redemption, and obligations of the vendor a retro. The Court explicitly invokes Article 1606 based on Alciso's initial belief the transaction was a mortgage.
*   **Civil Code Article 448:** Pertaining to rights of builders in good faith on another's land. Court finds it inapplicable.
*   **Civil Code Article 546 and 548** Referred to under Article 448, regarding the indemnity owed to a builder in good faith by the landowner, but not applicable here.
*   ***Pecson v. Court of Appeals*:** Held that Article 448 is not applicable when the owner of the land is the builder.
*   ***Gallar v. Husain*:** Clarified that the right to repurchase belongs to the vendor or their transferee.
*   ***Lee v. Court of Appeals*:** Highlighted that tender of payment is required to validly exercise the right to repurchase.
*   ***Laserna v. Javier*:** Clarified the new Civil Code Article 1606 and its 30-day privilege.
*   ***Florentino v. Encarnacion*:** Stated that the acceptance may be made at any time before the favorable stipulation is revoked and that the acceptance may be in any form -- it does not have to be formal or express but may be implied.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Court primarily affirms the CA's decision by recognizing Alciso's right to repurchase based on the stipulation *pour autrui*. The Court is generous to Alciso by granting her an additional 30-day period to exercise her right of repurchase. However, the determination of the repurchase price remains a crucial aspect. The litigation risk lies in the potential for disagreements and appeals regarding the valuation process in the RTC.
