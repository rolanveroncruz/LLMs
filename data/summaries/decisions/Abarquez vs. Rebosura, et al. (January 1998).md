## Summary of *Abarquez vs. Rebosura*, A.M. No. MTJ-94-986, *OCA vs. Rebosura*, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1052, and *Tarle vs. Rebosura*, A.M. No. MTJ-95-1069

**Case Overview:** This consolidated administrative matter involves Judge Bienvenido M. Rebosura of the Municipal Trial Court of Calape, Bohol, charged with gross misconduct arising from: (1) excessive delay in the disposition of cases (67 cases pending for over 90 days since 1981); (2) falsification of certificates of service; (3) falsification of quarterly reports; and (4) alleged discourtesy toward a litigant.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Excessive Delay:**  Multiple audits (by Exec. Judge Bautista & OCA) confirmed substantial delays. The OCA Report shows 24 cases were submitted for decision past the 90-day reglementary period, with some pending for over 10 years. The Supreme Court cites relevant case law establishing that failure to decide a case within the required period constitutes gross inefficiency. *In re Judge Jose F. Madara*, 104 SCRA 245 (1981); *Longboan vs. Judge Polig*, 186 SCRA 557 (1990); *Sabado vs. Cajigal*, 219 SCRA 800 (1993).
*   **Falsification:** Judge Rebosura repeatedly certified that all cases were decided within 90 days, enabling him to receive his salary despite the backlog. This violates Rule 3.09 of the Code of Judicial Conduct.
*   **Disregard for Court Orders:**  The Supreme Court notes the judge failed to comply with resolutions requiring him to decide specific cases within 30 days of notice, demonstrating further disrespect.
*   **Inefficient Court Management:** The court found that the workload of the Judge was manageable and that the Judge's own explanation for the failure to decide the cases was not satisfactory and in fact bordered on the contrived.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to decide cases within the period specified in the Constitution (3 months from filing of the last pleading per *Alfonso-Cortes vs. Maglalang*, 227 SCRA 482 (1993)).
*   Judges are required to be faithful to the law, to maintain professional competence, and to dispose of the court's business promptly (Canon 3, Rules 3.01 and 3.05 of the Code of Judicial Conduct).
*   Judges are responsible for proper and efficient court management (*Agcaoili vs. Ramos*, 229 SCRA 705 (1994)).

**Liabilities:**

*   Gross inefficiency in failing to decide cases within the prescribed period.
*   Falsification of official documents (Certificates of Service and Quarterly Reports).
*   Violation of litigants' constitutional right to a speedy disposition of cases (Article III, Sec. 16 of the Constitution; *Magdamo vs. Pahimulin*, 73 SCRA 110 (1976); *Lambino vs. Judge de Vera*, A.M. No. MTJ-94-1017, July 7, 1997).
* Violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, specifically Rule 3.09.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Evasive Explanations:**  The judgeâ€™s reliance on his clerk's errors and claims of "forgetting" simple cases are deemed inadequate defenses. His assertions of good faith are contradicted by the persistent pattern of falsification and delay.
*   **Lack of Remorse/Contrition:**  The judge's continued failure to act even after being directed to do so suggests a disregard for the authority of the Supreme Court.
*   **Severity of Penalty:**  The Supreme Court rejected the OCA's recommendation for a forced resignation with benefits, opting for dismissal with forfeiture of benefits due to the severity and duration of the misconduct.
*   **Alleged discourtesy towards a litigant:** The Court did find the explanation of the OCA satisfactory, however, the Court reminded the Judge to always observe courtesy and civility when dealing with parties and witnesses.

**Outcome:** Judge Rebosura was DISMISSED from service, forfeiting all retirement benefits and barred from reemployment in any branch of government.
