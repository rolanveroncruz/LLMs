## Legal Document Summary: NHMFC vs. Abayari et al. (G.R. No. 166508, October 2, 2009)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review under Rule 45)

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC), a GOCC.
*   **Respondents:** Mario Abayari, et al., NHMFC employees hired after June 30, 1989.

**Core Issue:** Validity of the execution of a prior court decision ordering NHMFC to pay meal, rice, medical, dental, optical, and children's allowances, and longevity pay to respondents.

**Background:**

*   Respondents filed a mandamus action to compel NHMFC to grant allowances allegedly enjoyed by other employees.
*   RTC ruled in favor of respondents, ordering NHMFC to pay allowances retroactive to their appointment dates.
*   CA affirmed the RTC decision.  Decision became final.
*   A Compromise Agreement to pay in installments was made but never judicially approved.
*   DBM issued a letter disallowing certain allowances, including those awarded to respondents.
*   Respondents filed a second motion for execution which was granted.

**Key Provisions/Holdings:**

*   **Mandamus Judgment Nature:** The original RTC decision was a special judgment, not one for the payment of a specific sum of money. Therefore, *execution by garnishment was improper*. Garnishment is only appropriate for judgments ordering the payment of a specific sum.
*   **COA Jurisdiction:** NHMFC is a GOCC; thus, any money claim against it, even one based on a final court judgment, *must first be filed with the Commission on Audit (COA)* for examination, audit, and settlement under Commonwealth Act No. 327, as amended by P.D. No. 1445. This includes claims arising from R.A. No. 6758.
*   **Prematurity of Recourse:** The Supreme Court held that the respondents' appeal to the CA and then to the SC was premature because they had not yet exhausted administrative remedies before the COA.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6758 (The Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989):** Specifically, Section 12 regarding allowances.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1267:** Creating the NHMFC.
*   **Commonwealth Act No. 327:** Fixing the time within which the Auditor General shall render His Decisions and Prescribing the Manner of Appeal Therefrom.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1445 (Government Auditing Code of the Philippines):** Grants COA authority to audit and settle government accounts.
*   **Rule 39, Sections 9 and 11, Rules of Court:** Pertaining to execution of judgments, specifically those for the payment of money versus special judgments.

**Case Law References:**

*   **De Jesus v. Commission on Audit (355 Phil. 584 (1998)):** Regarding the effectivity of Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10 due to lack of publication.
*   **National Electrification Administration v. Morales, G.R. No. 154200, July 24, 2007:** Regarding the requirement to file claims against GOCCs with the COA before execution.
*   Other cases cited reiterate the principle that GOCCs are subject to COA jurisdiction regarding money claims.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Incumbency Status:** The court noted that the respondents did not sufficiently prove they were incumbents as of July 1, 1989, which might affect their eligibility under Section 12 of R.A. 6758. This issue, while not ruled upon directly, is a potential point of contention before the COA.
*   **DBM Disallowance as Supervening Event:** The petitioner argued that the DBM disallowance constituted a supervening event rendering execution inequitable. The Court did not explicitly rule on this issue because of the COA's primary jurisdiction. This could become a significant point of argument before COA and potentially the SC after COA review.

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   NHMFC has an obligation to comply with the final court decision *after the COA has passed on the validity of the claim*.
*   Respondents have an obligation to file their claim with the COA before attempting to execute the judgment.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **COA Disallowance:** The COA could disallow all or part of the claim.
*   **Further Litigation:** If either party is dissatisfied with the COA's decision, further litigation is possible via a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court.
*   **Enforcement Delay:** The need to go through the COA process will significantly delay the enforcement of the final judgment.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the lower courts' orders regarding garnishment, holding that because the original judgment was a special judgment (mandamus) and because NHMFC is a GOCC, the respondents must first file their claim with the COA before any execution proceedings can take place.  The Court specifically avoided ruling on the merits of the DBM disallowance letter or the eligibility of the employees under RA 6758, leaving those issues for the COA.  The key takeaway is the necessity of exhausting administrative remedies before seeking judicial enforcement of claims against GOCCs.
