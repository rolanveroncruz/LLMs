## Legal Document Summary: *Beltran v. Cangayda* (G.R. No. 225033)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's affirmation of the RTC's decision ordering Petitioners to vacate land.

**Core Issue:** Whether the oral agreement between Spouses Beltran (Petitioners/Buyers) and Spouses Cangayda (Respondents/Sellers) was a *contract of sale* or a *contract to sell*.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA and RTC, holding the agreement was a *contract of sale*. Ownership passed to the Beltrans upon delivery/possession, despite incomplete payment.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Oral Agreement (1989):** Agreement for sale of land (300 sqm) for P35,000.  Beltrans took possession and built a house after initial payment.
*   **Payment:** Beltrans paid P29,690.  Balance of P5,310 remained unpaid.
*   **Amicable Settlement (1992):**  Acknowledged outstanding balance; Beltrans agreed to pay within one week and cover titling expenses; Cangaydas agreed to sign Deed of Sale upon full payment. Crucially, it lacks explicit language reserving title.
*   **SC Order:** Beltrans must pay balance (P5,310) within 30 days; Cangaydas must execute a Deed of Absolute Sale and deliver title upon payment. Failure to comply authorizes the Registrar of Deeds to issue a new title to the Beltrans.
**Liabilities:**

*   **Beltrans:** Obligation to pay the remaining balance.
*   **Cangaydas:** Obligation to execute the Deed of Absolute Sale and deliver title upon payment of the balance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Respondents Refusal:** Cangaydas may refuse to accept payment or execute the deed. The SC order addresses this by authorizing the Registrar of Deeds to transfer title in such an event. The procedure for engaging the registrar may entail further legal action and expense for the petitioners.
*   **Interest Rate:** The judgment debt bears interest at 6% per annum from finality until fully paid. This could impact total liability based on payment date.
*   **Lack of Specific Performance Details:** The order to "execute a Deed of Absolute Sale" lacks specifics on required clauses, potential representations and warranties, or division of transfer taxes. Further negotiation may be necessary to clarify such aspects.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Art. 1458, Civil Code:** Defines contract of sale.
*   **Art. 1477 & 1478, Civil Code:** Transfer of ownership upon delivery, absent contrary stipulation.
*   **Art. 1191, Civil Code:** Remedies for breach of reciprocal obligations (rescission or fulfillment).
*   **Art. 1592, Civil Code:** Right to pay even after the period, so long as no judicial or notarial demand for rescission has been made.
*   **Art. 1144, Civil Code:** 10-year prescription period for actions based on a written contract.
*   ***Platinum Plans Phil. Inc. v. Cucueco*** (522 Phil. 133): Distinction between contract of sale and contract to sell.
*   ***San Lorenzo Development Corp. v. Court of Appeals*** (490 Phil. 7):  Distinction between contract of sale and contract to sell.
*   ***Macasaet v. R. Transport Corp.*** (561 Phil. 605, 612-613) Essential requites of a contract.
*   ***Taguba v. Peralta*** (217 Phil. 690): Slight delay not sufficient ground for rescission.
*   ***Dignos v. Court of Appeals*** (242 Phil. 114): Court can grant vendee an additional period to pay even without a stipulated grace period.
*   ***Nacar v. Gallery Frames*** (716 Phil. 267): Establishes the interest rate of 6%

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The CA emphasized testimony showing the parties expected to enter into a sales agreement at some future date.
*   The SC, however, stated that the testimony did not suggest this.

**Maceda Law (R.A. No. 6552):**  Inapplicable because it was raised for the first time on appeal and the original agreement didn't mention this condition.

**Prescription/Laches:**

*   SC found the Respondents' action for recovery of possession prescribed under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, as it was filed more than 10 years after the breach of the Amicable Settlement.
