## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Aboganda*, G.R. No. 183565 (2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Eduardo Aboganda for two counts of rape.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** Eduardo Aboganda was charged and convicted of two counts of rape against his daughter, AAA, in violation of Article 266-A(1)(a) of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Prosecution:** Obligated to prove the elements of rape: carnal knowledge of the victim and use of force, threat, or intimidation.  Successfully did so through credible testimony of the victim.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** Initially sentenced to death by the RTC, but modified by the CA to *reclusion perpetua* due to Republic Act 9346 (abolishing the death penalty).  Liable for civil indemnity (PhP 75,000 per count), moral damages (PhP 75,000 per count, increased from RTC award of PhP50,000), and exemplary damages (PhP 25,000 per count, increased from RTC award of PhP20,000).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Sufficiency of Informations:** Accused-appellant argued the informations were insufficient for failing to state the precise dates of the rapes, allegedly prejudicing his defense. The Court rejected this argument, citing *People v. Ceredon* and *People v. Bunagan*, holding that in rape cases, the exact date is not an essential element; the material fact is the occurrence of rape, not the time.
*   **Incestuous Rape vs. Qualified Rape:** The CA corrected the RTC's erroneous conviction for incestuous rape, as the information failed to allege the victim's minority. However, the CA affirmed conviction for *qualified* rape because of the use of a deadly weapon (pisaw).
*   **Belated Raising of Issue:** The Supreme Court pointed out that Accused-Appellant only raised the alleged defects in the informations on appeal. Quoting *People v. Mauro*, the Supreme Court ruled that it was too late to protest the imprecise dates found in the informations against him. Accused-Appellant should have filed a motion for bill of particulars before his arraignment.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 266-A(1)(a), Revised Penal Code:** Defines rape, focusing on carnal knowledge achieved through force, threat, or intimidation.
*   **Republic Act 9346:** Abolished the death penalty, resulting in the modification of the original sentence.
*   **Section 10, Rule 110, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure:** Addresses the necessity of stating the date of the offense in the complaint or information.
*   ***US v. Dichao***: Case cited by the appellant to argue the date and time of the commission of the offenses as alleged in the informations are too indefinite.
*   ***People v. Ceredon***:  Held that in rape cases, the material fact is the occurrence of the rape, not the time of its commission.
*   ***People v. Bunagan***: Re-iterated that the exact date of the sexual assault is not an essential element of the crime of rape; what should control is the fact of the commission of the rape or that there is proof of the penetration of the female organ.
*   ***People v. Mauro***: Discussed the matter of an accused who gave a "not guilty" plea upon arraignment instead of questioning the so-called defect in the information against him.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:** None explicitly identified in the document; however, the defense attempted to exploit the ambiguity of the date and time. This was resolved by the court, but the initial charge of incestuous rape vs. qualified rape presents an opportunity for future contestation regarding the original intention of the persecution and proper legal procedures.
