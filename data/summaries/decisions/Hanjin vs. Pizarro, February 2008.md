## Legal Document Summary: *Hanjin v. Judge Pizarro & Sheriff Loy*

**Document Type:** Resolution of the Supreme Court (A.M. No. RTJ-08-2107)

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction Co., Ltd.
*   **Respondents:** Judge Rogelio M. Pizarro and Sheriff IV Neri G. Loy, RTC Quezon City, Branch 222

**Subject Matter:** Administrative Complaint against a judge and sheriff for Knowingly Rendering Unjust Judgment and Grave Abuse of Authority, arising from a Garnishment Order.

**Key Provisions & Background:**

*   **Civil Case No. Q-02-47707:** Original case dismissed by Judge Pizarro, then reinstated upon reconsideration sought by First United Construction Corp. et al.
*   **Disputed Order of March 17, 2004:** Order of Garnishment against Hanjin's deposit with RCBC for P1,344,408.83. Hanjin claims the order is baseless and was issued without notice. Judge Pizarro claims it's a forgery.
*   **Atty. Almadro:** The Motion for Reconsideration that led to the reinstatement was allegedly signed by a suspended lawyer, Atty. Ruben Almadro, which Hanjin alleges makes the reinstatement void.
*   **Previous SC Resolution:** The SC initially dismissed the case against Judge Pizarro and Sheriff Loy for insufficiency of evidence, and referred the administrative investigation of Atty. Almadro to the Office of the Bar Confidant.

**Obligations & Actions Ordered by This Resolution:**

*   **NBI Investigation:** The SC orders the NBI to conduct a further, thorough investigation to determine the authenticity of Judge Pizarro's signature on the March 17, 2004 Order. This is a *reversal* of the earlier dismissal.
*   **RCBC Production Order:** The SC orders the NBI to secure the "duplicate original" of the disputed March 17, 2004 Order from RCBC for forensic examination.  RCBC admitted to having this copy during a pre-trial.

**Potential Liabilities & Risks:**

*   **Judge Pizarro:** If the signature is proven genuine, Judge Pizarro could face serious disciplinary action, including potential removal from office, for knowingly rendering an unjust order or for Grave Abuse of Authority.  The original dismissal has now been effectively reversed.
*   **Sheriff Loy:** Sheriff Loy's liability depends on whether he acted in good faith reliance on a legitimate order.  If the Order is determined to be fraudulent, Loy could be liable for Grave Abuse of Authority.
*   **Atty. Almadro:** Already subject to investigation by the Office of the Bar Confidant. Potential disciplinary action for practicing law while suspended, potentially including disbarment.
*   **RCBC:** Could face scrutiny and potential liability if it knowingly complied with a fraudulent order.
*   **First United Construction Corp. et al.:** Could be facing liability as the original beneficiaries of the garnishment if the Order is fraudulent

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   Implied reference to disciplinary rules governing judges (potentially Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct).
*   Implicit reference to the Rules of Court regarding motions for reconsideration and reinstatement of cases.
*   Potential reference to provisions on forgery in the Revised Penal Code if the signature is indeed forged.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Duplicate Original":** The term "duplicate original" is vague and needs clarification. Is it a carbon copy signed by the judge, or something else? The exact nature of this document is critical for authentication.
*   **Restoration of Notices:** Whether the reinstatement of the case *automatically* restores the prior garnishments is a point of contention. Hanjin argues this requires a specific prayer in the motion. This argument relates to whether the Order of Garnishment was validly restored by the court.
*   **The RCBC pre-trial order only stipulates to possession, not necessarily to validity:** While RCBC admitted to having the 'duplicate original' of the order, it does not stipulate as to the order's validity or genuineness.

**Strategic Considerations:**

*   **Focus NBI investigation:** The NBI investigation is the key to determining the validity of the Order of Garnishment.
*   **Pursue Discovery:** In related civil cases, Hanjin should aggressively pursue discovery to uncover the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the March 17, 2004 Order.
*   **Consider criminal action:** If forgery is confirmed, Hanjin should consider filing criminal charges against those responsible.
