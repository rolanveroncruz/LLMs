## Legal Document Summary: Bondagjy v. Artadi, G.R. No. 170406 (2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the decision of the Fourth Shari'a Judicial District Court, which reversed the Second Shari'a Circuit Court's dismissal of a petition for divorce by *faskh*.

**Key Issue:** Whether the Fourth Shari'a District Court erred in reversing the Second Shari'a Circuit Court's finding that the divorce petition was barred by *res judicata* and non-compliance with the rule on certification against forum shopping.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the Fourth Shari'a Judicial District Court's decision, remanding the case to the Second Shari'a Circuit Court for hearing on the merits.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Grounds for Divorce by *Faskh*:** P.D. No. 1083 (Code of Muslim Personal Laws), Article 52, provides grounds for *faskh*, including (a) neglect or failure of husband to provide support for at least six months, (c) Failure of the husband to perform for six months without reasonable cause his marital obligation.
*   **Certification against forum shopping:** Section 5 of Rule 7 of the Rules of Court requires certification under oath against forum shopping.
*   **Sharia Court Procedure:** Special Rules of Procedure in Shari'a Courts, emphasizing reliance on Muslim Law sources (testimonial evidence, admission, oath) and suppletory application of the Rules of Court.

**Analysis of *Res Judicata*:**

*   The Court found no *res judicata* because the *causes of action* in the first (SCC Case No. 541) and second (Civil Case No. 2005-111) petitions were not identical.  The first case covered a period of alleged neglect *prior* to March 1996, while the second covered the period *after* the dismissal of the first case and at least six months *prior* to February 7, 2005.
*   The *evidence* needed to prove the alleged neglect during the two separate periods would necessarily differ. Therefore, even though the parties, subject matter, and the first three elements of *res judicata* were present (final judgment, on the merits, by a court with jurisdiction), the fourth element (identity of causes of action) was absent. *Serdoncillo v. Spouses Benolirao, 358 Phil. 83,103.*

**Forum Shopping:**

*   The Court deemed the respondent's verification to have substantially complied with the forum shopping rule.  *Robern Development Corporation v. Quitain, 315 SCRA 150*.
*   The omission of the dismissed annulment case filed with the RTC of Muntinlupa City in the certification was not fatal because it did not constitute *res judicata* or *litis pendentia*. The grounds for annulment under the Family Code and divorce by *faskh* are distinct, and the Muntinlupa case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. *Roxas v. Court of Appeals, 415 Phil 430, 445 (2001).*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidentiary Burden in Sharia Courts:**  The decision emphasizes the importance of *shahadah* (testimonial evidence) in Sharia Court proceedings, potentially requiring more extensive witness testimony.
*   **Vagueness of "Marital Obligations":** The precise definition of "marital obligations" under P.D. 1083 is not clearly delineated, potentially leading to interpretive disputes during the hearing.
*   **Determination of new supporting evidences:** The respondent should present sufficient evidence to show the husband failure to provide support for a period of at least six consecutive months before the 2005 petition.

*   P.D. No. 1083 (Code of Muslim Personal Laws of the Philippines)
*   Rules of Court, Rule 7, Section 5 (Certification against Forum Shopping)
