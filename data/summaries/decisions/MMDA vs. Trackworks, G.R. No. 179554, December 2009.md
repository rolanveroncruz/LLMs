**Case Summary: Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) vs. Trackworks Rail Transit Advertising, Vending and Promotions, Inc. (Trackworks)**
**G.R. No. 179554, December 16, 2009**

**Issue:** Whether MMDA has the authority to unilaterally dismantle billboards, signages, and other advertising media installed by Trackworks on Metro Rail Transit 3 (MRT3) structures, based on MMDA Regulation No. 96-009, given Trackworks' contract with Metro Rail Transit Corporation, Limited (MRTC) under a Build-Lease-Transfer (BLT) agreement governed by RA 6957.

**Ruling:** Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decisions, holding that MMDA did not have the power to unilaterally dismantle Trackworks' advertisements.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **BLT Agreement (RA 6957):** MRTC was granted development rights including the right to develop commercial premises and obtain advertising income from MRT3 for 25 years, after which ownership transfers to the Government. (Section 16.1)
*   **MRTC-Trackworks Contract:** MRTC contracted with Trackworks for advertising services, granting Trackworks the right to install billboards, etc., within the MRT3 structure.
*   **MMDA Regulation No. 96-009:** Prohibits the posting/installation of billboards, signs, etc., on roads, sidewalks, center islands, etc.

**Liabilities:**

*   MMDA held liable for costs of the suit.
*   MMDA has no authority to remove the signage.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **MMDA's Claim of Authority:** MMDA argues it was acting under its mandate (RA 7924) to ensure safe and convenient movement on thoroughfares, justifying its regulation. The Court rejected this.
*   **Ambiguity of "Public Areas":** MMDA regulation applies to public areas. The Court held MRT3, under the BLT agreement, is private property during MRTC ownership, thus not covered by the regulation. This distinction is critical and could be challenged if facts change (e.g., ownership transfer).
*   **Safety Argument:** MMDA's claim that the billboards are obstructions and distractions to motorists. The Court did not address the safety implications directly, focusing on MMDA's lack of authority.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **RA 6957 (Build, Operate and Transfer Law):** Governs the BLT agreement between the Government and MRTC.
*   **RA 7924 (MMDA Charter):** Defines MMDA's powers and functions. The Court emphasizes these are administrative, not legislative or police power.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1096 (Building Code):** MMDA's attempt to rely on this was rejected as enforcement authority lies with DPWH, unless delegated.
*   **Previous MMDA Cases:** *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc.*, *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Viron Transportation Co., Inc.*, and *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Garin*, cited to limit MMDA's powers.
*   **Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Trackworks Rail Transit Advertising, Vending & Promotions, Inc.* (G.R. No. 167514):* Prior case recognizing Trackworks' right to install advertising materials.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The scope of "public areas" as it relates to structures built on public land but privately owned/operated.
*   The potential conflict between the government's right to regulate and the private entity's rights under a BLT agreement.

**Legal Precision Notes:**

*   The Court distinguishes between administrative and police powers of the MMDA, reaffirming the limits of MMDA's authority.
*   The decision hinges on the private ownership of MRT3 at the time of the dispute, pursuant to the BLT agreement. Future ownership changes could affect the outcome.
*   The case emphasizes the importance of express legal authority and the limits of implied powers for government agencies.
