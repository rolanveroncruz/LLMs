**Case Summary: *Ravina v. Villa Abrille*, G.R. No. 160708, October 16, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA decision which modified the RTC decision in a case for Annulment of Sale, Specific Performance, Damages, and Attorney's Fees.

**Key Issue:** Validity of the sale of conjugal property by the husband without the wife's consent after the effectivity of the Family Code and whether the petitioners (Ravinas) were buyers in good faith.

**Facts:**

*   Spouses Pedro and Mary Ann Villa Abrille acquired Lot 7 (TCT No. T-88674) during their marriage. They also built a house on Lot 7 and an adjacent lot registered solely in Pedro's name.
*   Pedro, without Mary Ann's consent, sold Lot 7 and the house to the Ravinas. Mary Ann objected to the sale.
*   Mary Ann and her children were forcibly evicted from the house by Pedro and the Ravinas, aided by armed personnel.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Art. 124 of the Family Code:** Sale of conjugal property without the consent of both spouses is void. *Legal Risk:*  Sale declared void due to lack of wife's consent.
*   **Good Faith Purchaser Doctrine:** A buyer in good faith must inquire into the seller's capacity to sell if the property is registered in the name of the seller and their spouse. *Legal Risk:* The Ravinas were not considered buyers in good faith as Mary Ann's objection was known and her conformity was not obtained.
*   **Return of Consideration:** Pedro must return the value of the consideration for the lot covered by TCT No. T-88674 and the house to the Ravinas.
*   **Reconveyance:** The Ravinas are ordered to reconvey the lot and house to the spouses Pedro and Mary Villa Abrille.
*   **Art. 449 of the New Civil Code:**  Because improvements were made after the action was filed (cessation of good faith), Ravinas are not entitled to indemnity for improvements made.
*   **Damages:** Pedro and the Ravinas are held jointly and severally liable for moral and exemplary damages due to the manner of the eviction.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Pedro Villa Abrille:** Liable to return the purchase price to the Ravinas. Also jointly and severally liable for damages.
*   **Ravinas:** Jointly and severally liable for damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Void Sale:** The sale is declared void, leading to the reconveyance of the property.
*   **Damages Award:** Significant monetary liability for moral and exemplary damages due to their role in the eviction.
*   **Loss of Improvements:** No reimbursement for improvements made after notice of Mary Ann's claim.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 160 of the New Civil Code:** Presumption of conjugal property.
*   **Article 124 of the Family Code:** Requires consent of both spouses for disposition of conjugal property, or court authority. *Critical statute invalidating the sale.*
*   **Articles 19 and 21 of the Civil Code:** Basis for awarding damages for actions contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy.
*   **Article 449 of the Civil Code:** Pertaining to bad faith building on another's land.
*   **San Lorenzo Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 124242, January 21, 2005:**  Defines a purchaser in good faith.
*   **Bautista v. Silva, G.R. No. 157434, September 19, 2006:** Highlights the duty of inquiry when dealing with land registered in the name of a married person.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether the Ravinas were aware of the specific details of the marital discord prior to the sale is not explicitly discussed. A stronger argument could be made if their direct knowledge of the marital problems, beyond mere awareness of the marriage, was established.

**Conclusion:**

The Ravinas' purchase was deemed invalid due to the lack of spousal consent, as mandated by Article 124 of the Family Code. Their failure to adequately investigate Pedro's capacity to sell, given the joint ownership, negated any claim of being good faith purchasers. The case underscores the importance of due diligence and the need for explicit consent from both spouses in transactions involving conjugal property.
