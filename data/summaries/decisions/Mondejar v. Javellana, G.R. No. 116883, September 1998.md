## Legal Document Summary: Mondejar v. Javellana, G.R. No. 116883 (1998)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus challenging the dismissal of Cadastral Case No. RTC-280 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for lack of jurisdiction.

**Facts:**

*   NLRC execution sale of Dr. Broce's properties to satisfy labor judgment. Roman Catholic Bishop of San Carlos City, Inc. (RCBSCCI) was the highest bidder.
*   After the redemption period expired, a Final Deed of Sale was executed in favor of RCBSCCI.
*   RCBSCCI (through Bishop Mondejar) filed a "Petition For The Surrender of Certificates Of Title" (Cadastral Case No. RTC-280) in RTC to compel Broce and banks (PNB, DBP, Rural Bank of San Carlos City) holding title certificates to surrender them for transfer.
*   RTC initially granted the petition, ordering surrender and cancellation of titles (TCT Nos. T-7139, T-10093, T-10094) and issuance of new titles.
*   A Writ of Possession was subsequently granted.
*   Broce then filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing the case was an incident of the NLRC execution and thus exclusively within NLRC jurisdiction.
*   The RTC ultimately dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and nullified prior orders, prompting this petition.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Jurisdiction:**  The central issue is whether the RTC or the NLRC has jurisdiction over a petition to compel surrender of titles and obtain possession of property sold in an NLRC execution sale after the redemption period has expired.
*   **NLRC Execution Powers (Rule VII, Section 15, NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment):** Provides that the Sheriff should give deed and possession at the expiry of the redemption period unless a third party adversely holds the property. This suggests NLRC continuing jurisdiction.
*   **Estoppel by Laches:** RCBSCCI argues Broce is estopped from challenging jurisdiction due to his active participation in RTC proceedings (failure to initially object, motions for reconsideration, appeals to the Court of Appeals and Supreme Court).
*   **Land Registration Act (Act 496), Sections 111 & 112:** Discussed in the concurring/dissenting opinion, these sections vest jurisdiction in regular courts to handle issues relating to certificate of title entries, cancellation, and ordering the entry of a new certificate, especially when the owner's duplicate is withheld.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition, nullifying the RTC's dismissal orders and remanding the case.

**Rationale:**

*   **Continuing NLRC Jurisdiction (Majority Opinion):**  The Court acknowledged that ordinarily, the NLRC would retain jurisdiction to ensure the winning party can enforce a writ of possession.
*   **Estoppel by Laches (Majority Opinion):** However, the Court held that Broce was estopped by laches from challenging the RTC's jurisdiction *at this late stage*, given his prolonged participation and failure to raise the issue earlier.  Invokes *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* (23 SCRA 29 (1968)).
*   **Dissenting Opinion (Justice Melo):** Argued that the NLRC jurisdiction ended once the judgment was satisfied and did not extend to transferring titles to the RCBSCCI which was not a party to the labor case. Also raises point about finality of the Orders of Judges Basa and Layumas. The dissent emphasizes the role of regular courts under the Land Registration Act for title issues.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Broce:** Obligation to surrender titles (subject to potential impact of related pending cases).  Potentially liable for challenging jurisdiction too late.
*   **RCBSCCI:** Entitled to possession and transfer of titles (but ongoing risk of legal challenges affecting title).
*   **RTC:**  Obligated to continue proceedings to effectuate transfer (subject to further challenges).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Co-existence of Legal Actions:** Need to identify actions for Annulment of Sale, Recovery of Ownership, and Damages filed by Broce's wife to assess potential impact on title.
*   **Validity of Underlying Labor Judgment:**  The legality of the NLRC execution sale is the foundation. If that sale is invalid, the RCBSCCI's claim fails.
*   **Interpretation of "Adversely Holding" (NLRC Rule VII, Section 15):** The exact definition and application of what constitutes holding the property "adversely" to the losing party is unclear.
*   **Scope of Laches Doctrine:** Whether laches should apply when challenging subject matter jurisdiction.
*   **Splitting of Jurisdiction Concerns:** While the majority invokes laches, concerns regarding the splitting of jurisdiction between the NLRC and RTC remain.

**Statutory References:**

*   NLRC Manual on Execution of Judgment, Rule VII, Section 15
*   Land Registration Act (Act 496), Sections 111 and 112
*   Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, Section 19 (Jurisdiction of the RTC)

**Case Law:**

*   *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* (23 SCRA 29 (1968)): Key precedent on estoppel by laches.
*   *Balais v. Velasco* (252 SCRA 707 (1996)): Jurisprudence on NLRC jurisdiction and execution.
*   *Aragon v. Court of Appeals* 270 SCRA 603, 610 (1997).

**Recommendations:**

*   Analyze and determine whether the RTC had the jurisdiction to issue the assailed orders.
*   Closely examine the action for annulment of sale filed by Broce's wife, and analyze the potential challenges to title.
*   Monitor and assess any future potential legal actions raised to nullify the transfer.
*   Re-evaluate after considering the aforementioned ongoing cases.
