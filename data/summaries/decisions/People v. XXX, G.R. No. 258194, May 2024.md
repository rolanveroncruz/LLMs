## Legal Document Summary: People v. XXX, G.R. No. 258194

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming with modification the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment finding accused-appellant XXX guilty beyond reasonable doubt of multiple violations of R.A. No. 7610 ("Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act") and R.A. No. 9208 ("Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003," as amended by R.A. No. 10364).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violations:**
    *   Two counts of violating Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 (Sexual Intercourse with a Child Exploited in Prostitution).
    *   Three counts of violating Section 5(a)(1) of R.A. No. 7610 (Acting as a Procurer of a Child Prostitute).
    *   Three counts of violating Section 4(a) in relation to Sections 6(a) and 10(c) of R.A. No. 9208, as amended (Qualified Trafficking in Persons, due to the victim's minority).
*   **Factual Basis:** The accused-appellant procured the minor private complainant AAA (13 years old) for prostitution, booked her with clients, and on two occasions, forced himself on her.
*   **Evidence:** Conviction based primarily on the testimony of the private complainant, corroborated by medical evidence (healed hymenal lacerations, secretions in the cervix, and gonococcal infection), and police investigation.
* Defense: Accused-appellant relies solely on his testimony denying involvement.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused-Appellant:** To serve the imposed sentences for each count of the violations he was convicted of.
*   **Accused-Appellant:** To pay fines, moral damages, civil indemnity, and exemplary damages to the private complainant AAA, the amounts of which depend on the offenses and the number of counts as stated in the amended decision.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal:** Imprisonment, with specific indeterminate sentences assigned to each type of violation.
*   **Civil:** Significant monetary awards to the private complainant, including:
    *   Civil Indemnity (modified by the Supreme Court).
    *   Moral Damages (modified by the Supreme Court).
    *   Exemplary Damages (modified by the Supreme Court).
    *   Fines (as prescribed by the statutes).
    *   Legal Interest (6% per annum from finality of the decision until fully paid)

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Double Jeopardy:** Accused-appellant argues similarity of elements between R.A. No. 7610 and R.A. No. 9208 constitutes double jeopardy. This argument was rejected.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** Accused-appellant questions the complainant's credibility based on alleged inconsistencies and prior involvement in prostitution. This argument was rejected by all Courts.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 7610, Section 5(a)(1) and 5(b):** Defines and penalizes child prostitution and other sexual abuses, particularly acting as a procurer and engaging in sexual intercourse. *People v. Dumadag, 667 Phil. 664, 669 (2011)* used to argue that identities of private offended parties must be confidential.
*   **R.A. No. 9208 (as amended by R.A. No. 10364), Section 4(a), 6(a), and 10(c):** Defines and penalizes trafficking in persons, especially when the victim is a child.
*   **Republic Act No. 9231 (2003) Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, Sec. 5.**
*   **Republic Act No. 9208 (2003), sec. 3(a), Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003**
*   **Republic Act No. 7610, sec. 2**
*   ***Brozoto v. People, G.R. No. 233420, April 28, 2021***
*   ***People v. Udang, Sr., 823 Phil. 411, 411 (2018)***
*   ***People v. Milflores, 201 Phil. 154, 170 (1982)***
*   ***People v. Viloria, G.R. No. 249000, July 5, 2023***
*   ***People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 261970, June 14, 2023***
*   ***XXX255931 v. People, G.R. No. 255931, August 23, 2023***
*   **Double Jeopardy Doctrine:**  The court cited *People v. Udang, Sr., 823 Phil. 411, 411 (2018) [Per J. Leonen, Third Division]* that "a single criminal act may give rise to a multiplicity of offenses and where there is variance or differences between the elements of an offense in one law and another law".

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The main contention was the credibility of the victim's testimony, which the courts consistently upheld, giving deference to the trial court's opportunity to observe the witness's demeanor.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction on all charges, finding sufficient evidence to prove the accused-appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The monetary awards were also increased to fall in line with jurisprudence. The potential for overturning the conviction appears very low, given the factual findings, the corroborating medical evidence, and the consistent application of relevant legal principles by the lower and higher courts.
