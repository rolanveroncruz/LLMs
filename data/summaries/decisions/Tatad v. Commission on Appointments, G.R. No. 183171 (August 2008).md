## Legal Document Summary: Tatad vs. Commission on Appointments (G.R. No. 183171)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's dismissal of an appeal from the RTC, which in turn dismissed a complaint for declaration of nullity of the Commission on Appointments' (Commission) consent to the appointment of Teofisto Guingona, Jr. as Ambassador due to his age exceeding 70 years.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Central Issue:** Whether the appointment of an individual over 70 years old as Ambassador is valid under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7157 (Philippine Foreign Service Act of 1991). While the act may prohibit such appointments the case hinges on the **Mootness** of the case due to the Ambassador's resignation.
*   **Petitioner's Argument:** The Commission's consent was illegal because the appointee was over 70 years old, violating R.A. No. 7157 and public policy. The resignation does not moot the case, as a determination of responsibility for the alleged illegal act is necessary.
*   **Commission's Argument:** The case became moot upon the Ambassador's resignation.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court agreed with the CA and RTC that the resignation rendered the issue moot. Courts resolve actual controversies, not issue advisory opinions. No practical relief could be granted.
*   **Statutory Reference:** R.A. No. 7157 (Philippine Foreign Service Act of 1991) - Impliedly relevant, as it is the basis for the claim that age restrictions exist for Ambassadorial appointments. However, the Court never interpreted the Act because of the finding of mootness.
*   **Case Law:**
    *   *Olanolan v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 165491, March 31, 2005, 454 SCRA 807, 816:*  Cited regarding mootness and the lack of a justiciable controversy.
    *   *Villarico v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 132115, January 4, 2002, 373 SCRA 23; Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. v. Secretary of Labor, G.R. Nos. 96663 & 103300, August 10, 1999, 312 SCRA 104:* Cited about not determining a moot question if no practical relief can be granted.
    *   *Ticzon v. Video Post Manila, Inc., 389 Phil. 20, 23 (2000):*  Cited regarding the courts resolving actual cases, not rendering advisory opinions.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Interpretation of R.A. No. 7157:** The Court's reliance on mootness leaves the question of whether R.A. 7157 actually prohibits appointments of individuals over 70 unanswered. This creates potential uncertainty for future appointments.
*   **No Adjudication of Illegality:** Because the resignation rendered the issue moot, the commission was not held accountable for the alleged illegal appointment.

**Obligations/Liabilities:** The ruling primarily impacts future appointments and the need for strict adherence to eligibility requirements to avoid similar challenges. The commission does not hold any financial or legal liability, as the decision dismissed the case on the basis of mootness.
