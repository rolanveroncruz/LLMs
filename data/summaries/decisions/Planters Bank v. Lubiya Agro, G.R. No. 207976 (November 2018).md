## Legal Document Summary: *Planters Development Bank v. Lubiya Agro Industrial Corporation*

**Case:** G.R. No. 207976, November 14, 2018

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's decision nullifying extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.

**Key Issue:** Whether the lack of *personal* notice of extrajudicial foreclosure to the mortgagor, where the mortgage contract *requires* such notice, renders the foreclosure void.

**Ruling:** Affirmed CA decision; foreclosure declared void due to Planters Bank's failure to provide personal notice of the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings to Lubiya, as stipulated in Paragraph 12 of the real estate mortgage contracts.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreements:** Valid and subsisting. (P6,500,000.00 and P5,000,000.00)
*   **Real Estate Mortgage Contracts (Paragraph 12):** Stipulates that "all correspondence relative to this mortgage, including demand letters, summons, subpoenas, or **notification of any judicial or extra-judicial action**, shall be sent to the Mortgagor."  This is a crucial clause and the basis of the ruling.
*   **Planters Bank's Obligation:** To provide *personal* notice to Lubiya of any judicial or extrajudicial action, *including* the extrajudicial foreclosure sale. This is an obligation above and beyond statutory posting and publication requirements.
*   **Lubiya's Obligation:** To fulfill its obligations under the Loan Agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Planters Bank:** Liable for contractual breach by failing to provide personal notice of the foreclosure proceedings. This resulted in the nullification of the foreclosure sale, certificate of sale, and subsequent consolidation of title in Planters Bank's name.
*   **Lubiya:** Still liable for the principal amount of the loans and any applicable interests, but is entitled to redeem the foreclosed property under a properly conducted foreclosure.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Remedy of Foreclosure Still Available:** Planters Bank can initiate *new* foreclosure proceedings, ensuring strict compliance with both statutory requirements (Act No. 3135) and the *personal* notice provision in Paragraph 12.
*   **Damages:** Lubiya *could* potentially pursue damages related to the improperly conducted foreclosure, although this case does not award any damages.
*   **Statute of Limitations:** The window for the foreclosure may have closed or be closing.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135 (Extra-Judicial Foreclosure Law):** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages.  Section 3 outlines minimum requirements of posting and publication. *However, the case emphasizes that parties can stipulate additional requirements.*
*   ***Metropolitan Bank v. Wong, 412 Phil. 207 (2001):*** Key precedent; similar contractual stipulation requiring personal notice, which the bank failed to provide, rendering the foreclosure sale void.
*   ***Global Holiday Ownership Corporation v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, 607 Phil. 850 (2009); Carlos Lim v. Development Bank of the Philippines, 713 Phil. 24 (2013); Ramirez v. The Manila Banking Corporation, 723 Phil. 674 (2013):*** Consistent application of the *Wong* doctrine regarding contractual stipulations for personal notice.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central point of contention was Planters Bank's interpretation of Paragraph 12.  The Bank argued that the demand letter constituted sufficient notice, but the Court rejected this argument, emphasizing that a *specific* notice of the *foreclosure sale* itself was required.

**Analysis for Legal Action:**

*   **Breach of Contract:** The key legal theory is breach of contract due to Planters Bank's failure to comply with Paragraph 12.
*   **Due Process Argument:** While Lubiya raised a due process argument, the Court based its decision on the contractual obligation, not a constitutional violation.
*   **Contract of Adhesion:** The court notes the loan agreement and mortgage contracts are standard contracts of adhesion prepared by the Bank itself.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **New Foreclosure Action:** Initiate a *new* extrajudicial foreclosure proceeding, ensuring strict compliance with Act No. 3135 *and* Paragraph 12 of the mortgage contracts (personal notice to Lubiya of the foreclosure sale).
2.  **Review & Revise Mortgage Contracts:**  For future transactions, consider revising Paragraph 12 to clearly define the scope and nature of the "notification" requirement (specifically, if personal notice of the foreclosure sale is intended to be required, ensure it is explicitly stated.) Consider removing additional notification requirements altogether and relying solely on the statutory requirements.
3.  **Settlement:** Consider negotiating a settlement with Lubiya to avoid protracted and costly litigation. This might involve restructuring the loan or offering a discount on the outstanding debt.
