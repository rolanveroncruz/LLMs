**Case Summary: *Stradcom Corporation and Jose A. Chua v. Joyce Annabelle L. Orpilla*, G.R. No. 206800, July 2, 2018**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Termination for Just Cause (Art. 297(c) Labor Code):** Stradcom terminated Orpilla, HRAD Head, alleging loss of trust and confidence due to mishandling of Christmas party budget (overpricing), unauthorized use of company resources ("moonlighting"), and misrepresentation.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** The Court found a just cause for dismissal but noted Stradcom's failure to comply with the twin-notice requirement.
*   **Liability of Corporate Officer:** The Court reversed the Labor Arbiter's finding of solidary liability against Jose A. Chua (CEO), stating the acts were performed within his corporate capacity without malice or bad faith.
*   **Nominal Damages:** Due to the violation of Orpilla's right to procedural due process during her termination for a just cause, the Court awarded nominal damages.

**Obligations:**

*   **Employer (Stradcom):** Duty to provide procedural due process (two-notice rule) even when a just cause for termination exists.
*   **Employee (Orpilla):** Duty of loyalty and honesty in handling company affairs, particularly regarding finances and resource allocation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Stradcom:** Liable for nominal damages of P30,000 for violating Orpilla's right to procedural due process.
*   **Chua:** Not held personally liable for Stradcom's actions in the employee's dismissal.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **"Loss of Trust and Confidence":** Application of this ground for termination is highly fact-specific. The Court focused on the "managerial employee" status, requiring only a "basis" for loss of trust, not proof beyond reasonable doubt (*Alaska Milk Corporation, et al. v. Ponce*). The standard of proof is lower than for rank-and-file employees.
*   **Due Process:** Failure to strictly adhere to the twin-notice rule, even with a just cause for termination, exposes employers to liability for nominal damages (*Libcap Marketing Corp, et. al. v. Baquial*).

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 297 (formerly Art. 282):** Just causes for termination, specifically "fraud or willful breach of the trust."
*   **Alaska Milk Corporation, et al. v. Ponce, G.R. No. 224812, July 26, 2017:** Discusses the standard for loss of trust and confidence for managerial employees versus rank-and-file employees.
*   **Libcap Marketing Corp, et. al. v. Baquial, 735 Phil. 349 (2014):** Explains the award of nominal damages for violation of procedural due process in termination cases.
*   **Jaka Food Processing Corp. v. Pacot, 494 Phil. 114 (2005):** Differentiates between dismissal for just cause (Art. 282) and authorized cause (Art. 283) and their implications for sanctions due to lack of due process.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   The issue of whether Orpilla's actions truly constituted "willful" disobedience or "fraud" leading to loss of trust. The Court seems to defer to the NLRC's determination on this point, despite conflicting LA findings.

**Overall Assessment:**

The case clarifies the application of "loss of trust and confidence" as a just cause for termination, particularly regarding managerial employees. It highlights the importance of procedural due process, even when a just cause exists, and underscores the principle of separate juridical personality, shielding corporate officers from personal liability in most cases. Potential risks for employers lie in meticulously documenting grounds for loss of trust and strictly adhering to the twin-notice rule.
