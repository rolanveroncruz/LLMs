## Legal Document Summary: *Prime Marine Services, Inc. v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 97945, October 8, 1998)

**Case Summary:** Petition for certiorari challenging the NLRC's affirmation of the POEA's decision holding Prime Marine Services, Inc. (Prime Marine), R & R Management Services International (R & R Management), and Arabian Gulf Mechanical Services and Contracting Co., Ltd. (Arabian Gulf) jointly and severally liable for the illegal dismissal and underpayment of salaries of private respondent Napoleon Canut.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Joint and Solidary Liability:** Prime Marine, R & R Management, and Arabian Gulf are held jointly and severally liable for Canut's claims. This means each party is fully liable for the entire debt, per POEA Rules and Regulations, Bk. II, Rule II, ยง1 d(3) (1985).
*   **Liability for Unexpired Contract:** Obligation to pay SR 33,750.00 for the unexpired portion of the 18-month contract (15 months).
*   **Salary Differential:** Obligation to pay SR 350.00 as salary differential.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** Obligation to pay 5% of the total award as attorney's fees.
*   **Referral for Illegal Recruitment:** R & R Management is referred to the Anti-Illegal Recruitment Branch for appropriate action, presumably due to operating without a proper license.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Monetary Damages:** Prime Marine faces liability for the above monetary damages due to its role as the deployment agency and its failure to rebut allegations of joint processing of Canut's employment with R & R Management.
*   **Potential Criminal Liability (for R&R):** R&R Management may face criminal charges relating to illegal recruitment.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in the Level of Involvement:** Prime Marine's initial denial of involvement, followed by admitting its general manager's participation but claiming it was unauthorized and collusive, creates ambiguity and weakens its defense.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The core of the case rests on factual findings by the POEA and NLRC regarding Prime Marine's role in Canut's deployment. The court gives deference to these findings, making it difficult to overturn.
*   **Collusion Argument:** Prime Marine's last-minute claim of collusion between its general manager and Canut, without providing specific evidence, is likely to be viewed skeptically by the court.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **POEA Rules and Regulations:** The decision relies heavily on the POEA Rules and Regulations regarding the joint and solidary liability of recruitment/manning agencies, particularly Bk. II, Rule II, ยง1 d(3) (1985).
*   **_Ilas v. NLRC_, 193 SCRA 682 (1991):** Prime Marine attempted to use this case to argue that it shouldn't be held liable for unauthorized actions of an agent. The court distinguished this case, noting factual differences and Prime Marine's failure to disprove allegations of joint processing with R & R Management.
*   **Doctrine of Deference to Administrative Findings:** The court emphasizes the principle of deference to factual findings by administrative agencies (POEA and NLRC) when supported by substantial evidence, citing *International Container Terminal Services, Inc. v. NLRC, 256 SCRA 124 (1996)* and *Belaunzaran v. NLRC, 265 SCRA 800 (1996)*.

**Potential Defenses:**

*   **Lack of Authority (weakened):** While initially denied, Prime Marine claims it's Gen. Manager was not authorized. Argument is likely to fail because they did not argue this point until the appeal was rejected.
*   **Collusion:** Arguing collusion between its general manager and Canut. However, they provided no evidence to support this claim.

**Conclusion:** Prime Marine faces a difficult challenge in overturning the NLRC's decision due to the factual findings of the POEA and NLRC, the doctrine of deference to administrative agencies, and the lack of compelling evidence supporting its claims of unauthorized action and collusion.
