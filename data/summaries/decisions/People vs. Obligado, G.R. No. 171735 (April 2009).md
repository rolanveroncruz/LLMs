**Case Summary: *People v. Obligado*, G.R. No. 171735, April 16, 2009**

**Nature of the Case:** Appeal of a conviction for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

**Key Facts:** Alejo Obligado was convicted of murdering Felix Oliveros. The prosecution's evidence, primarily eye-witness testimony, established that Obligado, armed with a bolo, attacked Oliveros from behind, slashing his neck. The defense claimed accidental killing during a struggle for the bolo. The RTC convicted, appreciating treachery as a qualifying circumstance. The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the conviction but appreciated voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance, deleting exemplary damages.

**Key Provisions & Legal Issues:**

*   **Murder (Art. 248, RPC):** The central issue is whether the prosecution proved all the elements of murder beyond reasonable doubt, including intent to kill and the presence of a qualifying circumstance (treachery).
*   **Treachery:** This was deemed present, as the attack was sudden and unexpected, depriving the victim of any chance to defend himself. This aligns with established jurisprudence on treachery, e.g., *People v. Garin, G.R. No. 139069, 17 June 2004, 432 SCRA 394, 414.*
*   **Voluntary Surrender:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the CA's finding of voluntary surrender, noting that Obligado was intercepted by police officers and had no real choice but to yield. This relies on established jurisprudence that surrender must be spontaneous and voluntary.
*   **Damages:** The SC addressed the amounts of damages to award which includes civil indemnity, temperate damages, moral damages and exemplary damages:
    *   **Civil Indemnity ex delicto (P75,000):** Awarded as a matter of course for the crime of murder. *People v. Malolot, G.R. No. 174063, 14 March 2008.*
    *   **Temperate Damages (P25,000):** Awarded in lieu of actual damages because the proven actual damages were less than P25,000, for funeral expenditures. *People v. Belonio, G.R. No. 148695, 27 May 2004, 429 SCRA 579, 596.*
    *   **Moral Damages (P50,000):** Mandatorily awarded in cases of murder. *People v. Bajar, 460 Phil. 683, 700 (2003)*
    *   **Exemplary Damages (P25,000):** Awarded due to the presence of treachery. *People v. Garin, G.R. No. 139069, 17 June 2004, 432 SCRA 394, 414.*
    *   **Loss of Earning Capacity:** The Court refused to award indemnity for loss of earning capacity due to lack of documentary evidence showing that the victim was self-employed or a daily wage worker under the minimum wage. *People v. Oco, 458 Phil. 815, 855 (2003).*
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The court explicitly rejected the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, due to involuntary arrest.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Appellant Alejo Obligado:** Criminally liable for murder and must serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.  He is also liable to pay the heirs of the victim for civil indemnity, temperate, moral, and exemplary damages.
*   **State:** Obligation to enforce the judgment and ensure the punishment is carried out.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Disputes:** The conflicting testimonies of the witnesses is a point of contention. Resolution depends on credibility assessment of the witnesses.
*   **Proof of Intent:** The defense could still argue the prosecution failed to definitively prove intent to kill, despite the violent act. This argument seems weak given the nature of the wound and circumstances.
*   **Quantum of Evidence:** The defense may question the adequacy of evidence to establish moral damages (though these are awarded automatically in murder cases now.) The absence of complete documentation for actual damages limited that award.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction for murder, removing the improperly appreciated mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and adjusting the amount of damages awarded. The prosecution successfully proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, highlighting the dangers of relying on weak defenses such as accidental killing. The legal analysis is solid, consistent with established Philippine jurisprudence on murder, treachery, and the applicable rules for awarding damages.
