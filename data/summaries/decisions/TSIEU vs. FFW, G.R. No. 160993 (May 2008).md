**Case:** *Temic Semiconductors, Inc. Employees Union (TSIEU)-FFW v. Federation of Free Workers (FFW)*, G.R. No. 160993, May 20, 2008.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision, which in turn upheld the Bureau of Labor Relations' (BLR) ruling that invalidated a writ of execution for exceeding the scope of the original order. The original order declared the nullity of FFW's receivership over TSIEU. The subsequent writ of execution sought to enforce the turnover of properties and remittance of monetary claims to TSIEU (specifically the Dimaano faction). The Court held that the declaration of nullity of receivership did not automatically include a judgment for monetary or property claims, as these issues were not raised or adjudicated in the original proceedings before the BLR Regional Director.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Original Order (March 24, 1998):**  Declaration of nullity of FFW's receivership over TSIEU.  *No monetary or property claims awarded.*
*   **Writ of Execution (Sept 23, 1998):**  Attempted to enforce the turnover of properties and remittance of Php 6,896,400 to TSIEU.  *This was deemed invalid.*
*   **FFW Obligations (after original order):**  FFW was obligated to cease receivership control over TSIEU.
*   **TSIEU Obligation (after nullification of execution order):** TSIEU cannot recover funds and other properties in this case. The issue of money and properties must be filed separately.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **TSIEU's Risk:** Failed to timely and properly litigate the issue of monetary and property claims. Relied on the execution of an order that did not explicitly award such claims.  Faces the risk of potentially being time-barred from pursuing these claims separately.
*   **FFW's Liability (Past):**  Initially incurred liability for imposing an unauthorized receivership, which led to the original order. This liability does not extend to paying the union money or returning the subject properties in the present execution.
*   **Risk of Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel:** If TSIEU attempts to relitigate the property and monetary claims, they may face a defense of res judicata/collateral estoppel if the issues were implicitly decided in the original case.
*   **Potential Risk:** The Dimaano faction did not return to work after the DOLE ordered them to, creating a risk that such faction could not be entitled to receive the amounts claimed.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code Articles 241 & 242:** Referenced by the Regional Director regarding the requirements for complaints and rights of legitimate labor organizations, respectively.
*   **Collantes v. Court of Appeals, GR No. 169604, March 6, 2007:**  Cited for the principle that a final and executory judgment is immutable.
*   **Exception to Immutability of Judgement:** The exceptions of the immutability of judgment were specified as (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Scope of the Receivership Nullification:** Whether it inherently included the return of properties and funds managed during the receivership. The court definitively ruled it did *not*.
*   **The CA specifically rejected TSIEUâ€™s contention that the September 23, 1998 writ of execution did not exceed the terms of the final and executory March 24, 1998 Order of the NCR RD**
*   The proceedings conducted by the NCR RD for TSIEU-Dimaano to prove its claims for properties and receivables are null and void as such proceedings do not partake of the nature of nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to private respondents.

**Legal Strategy Implications:**

*   **TSIEU's Failed Strategy:**  Attempted to use the writ of execution as a "back door" to secure monetary and property claims without proper adjudication in the original proceedings.
*   **Importance of Precise Pleadings:**  This case highlights the critical importance of raising all relevant claims and issues during the initial stages of litigation. Failure to do so can preclude recovery later, even in the execution phase.
*   **Nunc Pro Tunc Application:** Emphasizes the limited scope of *nunc pro tunc* entries, clarifying that they cannot be used to substantially alter a judgment.
