## Legal Document Summary: Mazy's Capital, Inc. vs. Republic of the Philippines

**Document:** G.R. No. 259815, August 05, 2024

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Mazy's Capital, Inc. (Mazy's)
*   **Respondent:** Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of National Defense (DND)

**Subject Matter:** Dispute over a 46,143-square meter property (Lot 937) in Cebu City, part of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate.

**Key Provisions and History:**

*   **1938 Expropriation Case (Civil Case No. 781):** Commonwealth of the Philippines filed an expropriation complaint against landowners, including Eutiquio Uy Godinez (owner of Lot 937). A partial decision (April 22, 1939) granted Felisa Sy Cip (Eutiquio's widow) PHP 1,845.72 as just compensation, which was purportedly paid. The 1940 Decision deemed lot 937 already resolved.
*   **1954 Reconstitution Case (G.L.R.O. Record No. 5988):** Mariano Godinez (Eutiquio's son) filed for judicial reconstitution of title, claiming the original title was lost during the war. The CFI granted the petition, issuing TCT No. RT-6757 to Mariano based on a technical description, survey plan, and tax declaration.
*   **1997 Reivindicatoria Action (Civil Case No. CEB-19845):** Mariano sued the Republic, claiming ownership based on the reconstituted title. The RTC ruled in Mariano's favor, stating the expropriation was never consummated due to non-payment of just compensation. The CA affirmed; this decision became final and executory.
*   **2018 Sale:** Mariano sold Lot 937 to Mazy's; TCT No. 107-2018002380 was issued in Mazy's name.
*   **2013 Cancellation Case (Civil Case No. CEB-39718):** The Republic filed a complaint to cancel the reconstituted title, alleging fraud and prior payment of just compensation (evidenced by a Provincial Voucher). The RTC dismissed the case based on *res judicata*. The CA reversed, remanding the case for further proceedings.

**Court's Rulings:**

1.  The order in the reconstitution case is **void** due to Mariano's failure to comply with the strict statutory and jurisprudential requirements of R.A. 26, including proving the loss/destruction of title, not adequately using the sources provided in law and using unauthorized documents to reconstitute the title.

2.  The decision in the reivindicatoria case is **void** as well, as Mariano's only basis of ownership and the lower court's determination of ownership was a title that was based on a void judgment.

3.  Republic *had* fully paid just compensation to Eutiquio's estate, as evidenced by the Provincial Voucher found in the records of the Expropriation Case, thereby transferring ownership of Lot 937 to the Republic as far back as 1938.

**Key Issues:**

*   **Validity of Reconstituted Title:** Did the reconstitution of Mariano's title comply with Republic Act No. 26?
*   **Res Judicata:** Is the Republic barred from relitigating ownership due to the finality of the Reivindicatoria Case?
*   **Payment of Just Compensation:** Did the Republic pay just compensation in the 1938 expropriation proceedings?
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value:** Is Mazy's an innocent purchaser for value, despite the potential defects in Mariano's title?

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 26 (Reconstitution Law):** Strict compliance required for judicial reconstitution of title.
*   **Republic Act No. 9443** Does not serve to validate void reconstituted title, see  *Manotok IV v. Heirs of Homer L. Barque*, 683 Phil. 448 (2012)
*   **Spouses Aboitiz v. Spouses Po:** Distinction between annulment of judgment and reconveyance/annulment of title actions.
*   **Aledro-Ruña v. Lead Export and Agro-Development Corp.:** Relaxation of *res judicata* for substantial justice.
*   **Barnes v. Padilla**: relaxation of immutability of judgment for substantial justice.
*   **Calvo v. Zandueta and Ordoñez:** Title to expropriated property passes upon full payment of just compensation.
*   **Innocent Purchaser for Value Doctrine:** Duty to exercise due diligence, especially with reconstituted titles.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Republic's Negligence:** Why was the Provincial Voucher not presented in the Reivindicatoria Case?
*   **Mazy's Due Diligence:** What investigations did Mazy's conduct before purchasing the property? Did it have notice of the pending Cancellation Case or other claims by the Republic?
*   **Provincial Voucher Authenticity:** Although now affirmed, there were arguments concerning the Provincial Voucher's authenticity which must be considered.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Mazy's:** Burden of proving it is an innocent purchaser for value, as well as any other affirmative defenses on the merits.
*   **Republic:** Burden of disproving Mazy's claims of good faith and innocent purchaser status.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Mazy's Loss of Property:** If Mazy's cannot prove it is an innocent purchaser for value, it risks losing the property to the Republic.
*   **Republic's Liability:** If Mazy's proves its status as an innocent purchaser for value, the Republic might be equitably estopped and the Republic's title may be defeated.
*   **Continued Litigation:** Further proceedings in the CA and potential appeals could prolong the dispute.

**Remand to CA:**

The Supreme Court remanded the case to the CA for further proceedings to determine:

1.  Mazy's status as an innocent purchaser for value.
2.  Whether the Republic is guilty of laches.
3.  Any other defenses or claims that the parties may raise which have not yet been disposed of in this Decision, with reference to specific guidance provided regarding what facts must be determined.
