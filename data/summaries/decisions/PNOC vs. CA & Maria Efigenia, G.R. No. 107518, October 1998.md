## Legal Document Summary: PNOC Shipping vs. Maria Efigenia Fishing

**Case:** PNOC Shipping and Transport Corporation vs. Honorable Court of Appeals and Maria Efigenia Fishing Corporation (G.R. No. 107518, October 8, 1998) citing 358 Phil. 38.

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals decision affirming the lower court's judgment holding PNOC liable for damages arising from a maritime collision.

**Facts:** In 1977, the M/V Maria Efigenia XV, owned by Maria Efigenia Fishing Corporation, collided with the Petroparcel, then owned by Luzon Stevedoring Corporation (LSC). A Board of Marine Inquiry found the Petroparcel at fault due to negligent navigation. PNOC Shipping subsequently acquired the Petroparcel and assumed LSC's liabilities per a Deed of Transfer and Agreement of Transfer. Maria Efigenia Fishing Corporation sued LSC and the Petroparcel captain, later amending the complaint to include PNOC, seeking damages for loss of the vessel, equipment, and unrealized profits.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Assumption of Liability:** PNOC assumed all obligations arising from the Petroparcel, including liabilities from the collision (stipulated fact in the Pre-Trial Order).
*   **Damages Claimed:** Plaintiff initially claimed P692,680, later amending to include P600,000 for the hull value after insurance and requesting adjustments for inflation and unrealized profits.
*   **Actual/Compensatory Damages:** The heart of the dispute revolves around proving actual damages under **Article 2199 of the Civil Code**. The Court reiterates the principle that actual damages must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty based on competent evidence.
*   **Nominal Damages:** The court awarded nominal damages of 2,000,000 after finding that the actual damage of the private respondent was not adequetly proven.
*   **Docket Fees:** The court recognized that the plaintiff initially only paid docket fees associated with the original complaint. It notes that this failure to pay the docket fees should be considered a lien on the judgement in accordance with the ruling in *Sun Insurance Ltd. v. Asuncion*.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initial Liability:** The Board of Marine Inquiry determined the Petroparcel (now owned by PNOC) was at fault for the collision.
*   **Lower Court Decision:** The trial court awarded P6,438,048 in actual damages, P50,000 for attorney's fees, and costs of suit against PNOC.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** The Supreme Court **modified** the Court of Appeals decision, setting aside the award for actual damages (P6,438,048) due to insufficient evidence, but affirmed a P2,000,000 award as *Nominal* damages.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Evidentiary Issues:** The core legal issue is the admissibility and probative value of the price quotations (Exhibits C, D, E, F, H) as evidence of actual damages. The Supreme Court found them inadmissible as "commercial lists" under **Section 45, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence**, citing the *ejusdem generis* principle. This highlights the risk of relying on non-authenticated private documents to prove damages. The Court emphasizes that while certain evidence can be admitted, that doesnt necessarily mean that it has probative weight in the court of law.
*   **Hearsay:** The price quotations were deemed hearsay because the authors were not presented as witnesses. Even without objection, hearsay evidence has no probative value. This poses a risk for parties relying on hearsay to prove damages.
*   **Self-Interest:** The sole witness (Del Rosario, owner of the plaintiff corporation) was viewed as having a self-interest, requiring cautious consideration of his testimony. This is a common risk with testimony from parties with a vested interest in the outcome.
*   **Inflation Argument:** The court did not discuss or award any form of interest on the price difference of the goods lost in 1977 and the replacement costs in 1987. It deemed the price quotations to be inadmissible.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2199 of the Civil Code:** Defines actual or compensatory damages and the need for proof.
*   **Rule 130, Sections 36 & 45 of the Revised Rules on Evidence:** Address hearsay evidence and exceptions (specifically "commercial lists").
*   ***Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion***: Jurisprudence on docket fee payments and their effect on jurisdiction, leading to the "lien on judgment" principle.
*   ***Lufthansa German Airlines v. Court of Appeals***: Supports awarding nominal damages in the absence of competent proof of actual damages.
*   *Ejusdem Generis* Principle: Used in interpreting the scope of "commercial lists" under Rule 130.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the critical importance of presenting *competent* and *admissible* evidence to prove actual damages in tort cases. The court's rejection of the price quotations as hearsay and the cautionary view of the owner's testimony highlight the risks associated with relying on insufficient or improperly presented evidence. The final nominal damage award acknowledges the injury but emphasizes the failure to meet the evidentiary burden for actual damages.
