## Legal Document Summary: H. Tambunting Pawnshop, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (G.R. No. 171138)

**Nature:**  Petition for review assailing the CA decision that held H. Tambunting Pawnshop, Inc. (Tambunting) liable for deficiency Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) on pawn tickets.

**Key Issue:** Whether pawn tickets issued by Tambunting are subject to DST under Section 195 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision but deleted surcharges and interest.  It held that pawn tickets are subject to DST, as they document the pledge transaction.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 195 of the NIRC:** Imposes DST on "every mortgage or pledge of lands, estate, or property, real or personal..."  The Court interpreted this to apply to all pledges, regardless of the governing law (Civil Code or Presidential Decree No. 114).
*   **Presidential Decree No. 114 (Pawnshop Regulation Act):**  Defines a pawn ticket as the "pawnbroker's receipt for a pawn [and] is neither a security nor a printed evidence of indebtedness." Despite this definition, the Court considered it evidence of the pledge.
*   **Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Manual of Regulations for Non-Bank Financial Institutions (Sec. 4322P):** Prescribes the contents of a pawn ticket, which the Court noted contains essential information equivalent to a pledge agreement.
*   **Section 173 of the NIRC:** Stamp Taxes Upon Documents, Loan Agreements, Instruments and Papers.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Deficiency DST:**  Tambunting was held liable for the deficiency DST of Php 50,910.00 for taxable year 1997. However, the imposition of the surcharge and interest are deleted per the ruling.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Definition of "Document" under Sec 195:** Tambunting argued the DST should apply to the pledge agreement if any issued not the pawn ticket itself, whereas the CIR argued that the pawn ticket serves as the agreement to the pledge itself.
*   **Conflict between NIRC and PD 114:**  Tambunting maintained that because DST is imposed on document of indebtedness and PD 114 defines the pawn ticket to not be such, the pawnbroker shouldn't be liable.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 195 NIRC**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 114, Section 3**
*   **Presidential Decree No. 114, Section 12**
*   **Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 166786, May 3, 2006, 489 SCRA 147:**  Cited as precedent for the imposition of DST on pawn tickets.
*   **Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. 166786, September 11, 2006, 501 SCRA 450.:** Cited for the deletion of surcharges and interest due to good faith.
*   **Civil Code, Art 2093**: Definition of a Pledge.
*   **Civil Code, Arts 2085 up to 2122**
*   **Civil Code, Art 2096 & 1358**

**Dissenting Opinion (Not Binding, but Informative):**

*   The dissenting opinion argues that a pawn ticket is merely a receipt and does not document the pledge, which is instead documented in the pawnbroker's memorandum book. Therefore, the dissent suggests the ticket should not be subject to DST.
*   Also argues that PD 114, as a special law intended to benefit small borrowers, should prevail over the general provisions of the NIRC, granting an exemption from DST.
*   Discusses the legislative history and the interpretation of the BIR regarding DST and pawn transactions.

**Overall Assessment:**  Tambunting ultimately lost the appeal regarding the DST assessment itself, but gained by the deletion of surcharges and interests imposed on the deficiency as there were no previous judgements.
