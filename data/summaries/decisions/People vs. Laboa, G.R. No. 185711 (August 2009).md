## Legal Document Summary: People v. Laboa, G.R. No. 185711 (2009)

**Type of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming with modification the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction for rape.

**Case Summary:** Reynaldo Sanz Laboa was convicted of rape under Article 266-A (d) of the Revised Penal Code, involving a victim under 12 years old. The prosecution's evidence included the victim's testimony, a witness who saw Laboa on top of the victim undressed, and medical evidence of hymenal lacerations. The defense was denial.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Conviction for Rape (Art. 266-A(1)(d), Revised Penal Code):** Laboa was found guilty of rape based on carnal knowledge of a woman under 12.
*   **Penalty (Art. 266-B, Revised Penal Code):** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Indemnity:** P50,000 awarded to the victim.
*   **Moral Damages:** P50,000 awarded to the victim.
*   **Costs:** Laboa is ordered to pay the costs of the suit.
*   **Credit for Preventive Imprisonment:**  Entitled to full credit for period of preventive imprisonment as per Article 27 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 6127, if complied with disciplinary rules.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Reclusion Perpetua.
*   **Civil Liability:** P100,000 to the victim (Civil Indemnity and Moral Damages), plus the cost of the suit.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Challenge to Factual Findings:** The Supreme Court affirmed the findings of the lower courts regarding credibility of witnesses and factual circumstances of the case.
*   **Lack of Aggravating Circumstances for Exemplary Damages:**  The award of exemplary damages was deleted because no aggravating circumstances were proven to have attended the commission of the crime, in line with Article 2231 of the Civil Code and People v. Amba, 417 Phil. 852, 865 (2001).

*   **People v. Lopez, 362 Phil. 285, 293 (1999):** No woman would want to go through the process, the trouble and the humiliation of trial for such a debasing offense, unless she actually has been a victim of abuse and her motive is but a response to the compelling need to seek and obtain justice.
*   **People v. Velasquez, 427 Phil. 454, 461 (2002):** In order to establish rape, it is not necessary to show that the hymen was ruptured, as full penetration of the penis is not an indispensable requirement. What is fundamental is that the entrance, or at least the introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum, is proved.
*   **People v. Galisim, 421 Phil. 638, 647 (2001):**  When the testimony of a rape victim is consistent with the medical findings, sufficient basis exists to warrant a conclusion that the essential requisite of carnal knowledge has thereby been established.
*   **People v. Agravante, 392 Phil. 543, 551 (2000):** Denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak defense. Unless supported by clear and convincing evidence, the same cannot prevail over the positive declaration of the victim.

*   **People v. Amba, 417 Phil. 852, 865 (2001):** Exemplary damages may be awarded if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Clarity on Penetration:**  While the court found consummated rape, the victim couldn't confirm penetration. The court relied on partial entry and circumstantial evidence. This is a common challenge in rape cases.
*   **Dissenting Opinion on Exemplary Damages:** Justice Carpio Morales dissented, arguing that the victim's minority alone should warrant exemplary damages, diverging from the strict interpretation of Article 2230 of the Civil Code.
