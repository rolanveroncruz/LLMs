**Case Summary: *Ronelo Polo v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 160541, October 24, 2008 (Homicide)**

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction Affirmed:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Ronelo Polo for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   **Sentence:** Indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* maximum, as minimum, to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal* medium, as maximum, remains.
*   **Damages:** Modifications were made to the damages awarded. Actual damages of P30,000 were deleted. Temperate damages of P25,000.00 were awarded. Indemnity for death remains at P50,000.00. Moral damages remain at P50,000.00. Loss of earning capacity of P398,574.00 was awarded based on testimonial evidence of the victim's income, applying the established formula.

**Obligations:**

*   Polo is obligated to serve the imposed sentence.
*   Polo is obligated to pay the heirs of Danilo Balisoro the indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and loss of earning capacity as specified above.

**Liabilities:**

*   Criminal liability for Homicide under Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code.
*   Civil liability arising from the criminal act, encompassing indemnity, moral damages, temperate damages, and loss of earning capacity.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Self-Defense:** Polo's defense of self-defense was rejected by the trial court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court due to inconsistencies in defense witness testimonies and failure to prove unlawful aggression on the part of the victim.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The Court rejected Polo's claims for mitigating circumstances.
    *   **Voluntary Surrender:** The existence of a duly served warrant of arrest contradicted Polo's claim of voluntary surrender. The court gave more credence to the warrant.
    *   **Sufficient Provocation:** No sufficient provocation from the victim was proven to excuse the commission of the crime.
*   **Evidence Admissibility:** The Court allowed testimony regarding the victim's income, even in the absence of documentary evidence, because the defense did not object to it. This ruling cites *People v. Tigle* and reinforces the principle that evidence not objected to is deemed admitted and may be validly considered. The quantification of loss of earning capacity is based on this testimony and standard formula.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes Homicide.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review to the Supreme Court.
*   **Danofrata v. People, 458 Phil. 1018 (2003):** Affirms the principle that factual findings affirmed by the Court of Appeals are generally conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court.
*   **People v. Tigle, 465 Phil. 368 (2004):** Requires proving actual damages with a reasonable degree of certainty based on competent proof and best obtainable evidence. Also holds that evidence not objected to is deemed admitted.
*   **People v. Villanueva, 456 Phil. 14 (2003):** Used as basis for awarding temperate damages in lieu of actual damages when the proven actual damages are less than the standard temperate damage amount.

**Ambiguities and Legal issues:**

*   The apparent tension between the claim of voluntary surrender and the existence of a warrant of arrest. This suggests a potential issue regarding the timing and circumstances of Polo's surrender. The Court placed more value on the warrant of arrest.
*   The awarding of damages for loss of earning capacity based solely on the testimony of the victim's wife, absent documentary evidence.
