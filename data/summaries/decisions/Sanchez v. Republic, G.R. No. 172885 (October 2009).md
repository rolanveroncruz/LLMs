**Summary of *Sanchez v. Republic of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 172885**

**Case:** *Manuel Luis S. Sanchez v. Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)*

**Legal Issue:** Whether a corporate officer (Sanchez) can be held personally liable for the corporation's (ULFI) debts under Section 31 of the Corporation Code due to gross negligence or bad faith in managing corporate affairs, specifically failure to remit collected rents to DECS. Also, whether the action is barred by res judicata or constitutes forum shopping.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Background:**  The University of Life Foundation, Inc. (ULFI) managed the University of Life Complex, owned by the government. An agreement obligated ULFI to remit a percentage of income to HSDC (later SIDCOR), which was never paid.  After the Marcos regime, DECS assumed ownership and management, entering into a Management Agreement with ULFI requiring remittance of net income to the Bureau of Treasury through DECS.
*   **Breach:** After the management agreement expired in 1991, ULFI continued to manage the Complex, collecting rents but failing to remit them to DECS. Sanchez, as Executive Vice-President and Finance Director, and Henri Kahn (President), controlled funds and their disbursement.
*   **Cause of Action:** DECS sued Sanchez and Kahn personally under Section 31 of the Corporation Code for unremitted rents and damages, alleging gross negligence and bad faith. The RTC and CA found them jointly and severally liable.
*   **Corporation Code Sec. 31**: Directors or trustees are jointly and severally liable for damages resulting from their gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation.

**Holding:**  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision, holding Sanchez personally liable.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Not Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The court clarified that the case was not about piercing the corporate veil, but rather about direct liability under Section 31 of the Corporation Code.
*   **Bad Faith/Gross Negligence:** The Court found that Sanchez and Kahn acted in bad faith or with gross negligence by continuing to collect rents after ULFI's management authority expired, failing to remit the funds to DECS, and failing to provide an accounting of the collected funds. The evidence showed deposits in the names of Sanchez and the ULFI accountant which permitted only them to withdraw and spend the funds
*   **Doctrine of Corporate Opportunity**: Section 31 lays down the "doctrine of corporate opportunity" and holds personally liable corporate directors found guilty of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of the corporation
*   **Res Judicata/Forum Shopping:** The Court rejected Sanchez's arguments of res judicata and forum shopping. The prior ejectment suit against ULFI was distinct from the action seeking personal liability of officers for mismanagement under Sec. 31.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Definition of Bad Faith:** Defined as breach of faith and willful failure to respond to plain and well understood obligation. *Board of Liquidators v. Heirs of M. Kalaw, 127 Phil. 399, 421 (1967).*
*   **Definition of Gross Negligence:** The want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to consequences insofar as other persons may be affected. *Fernando v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 96182, August 19, 1992, 212 SCRA 680, 691.*
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:**  Referenced that it's an equitable remedy when corporate fiction is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud or defend a crime.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Section 31, Corporation Code:** Direct liability of directors/officers for gross negligence or bad faith.
*   **Republic Act 6847:** Transferred full control and management of the Complex to DECS.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Bad Faith" and "Gross Negligence":**  The determination of whether conduct constitutes bad faith or gross negligence can be fact-dependent and subject to interpretation, potentially leading to inconsistent application of Section 31.
*   **Burden of Proof:**  The burden rests on the plaintiff (DECS) to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Sanchez acted with gross negligence or bad faith, as opposed to mere poor judgment.  The CA/SC found this burden met by the failure to account for rents.
*   **Scope of Liability:**  The extent of damages recoverable under Section 31 may be subject to further litigation.
