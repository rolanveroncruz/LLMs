**Legal Document Summary: _Cecilia A. Agno vs. Atty. Marciano J. Cagatan, A.C. No. 4515_**

This document is a Supreme Court decision in an administrative case (disbarment proceeding) filed by Cecilia A. Agno against Atty. Marciano J. Cagatan for violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Disbarment of a lawyer for deceit, misrepresentation, and issuing a worthless check.
*   **Background:** Atty. Cagatan, as President of ISRC, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Khalifa H. Juma (complainant's husband) for joint ownership of ISRC. Mr. Juma invested P500,000.00. Complainant alleged the funds were to be used for license reinstatement and business operations. The lawyer failed to disclose the ISRC's true state of affairs.
*   **Allegations Against Cagatan:**
    *   Fraudulently induced Khalifa to invest in ISRC.
    *   Failed to comply with the MOA's terms regarding SEC registration of new ownership.
    *   Used the P500,000.00 for personal benefit.
    *   Issued a bouncing check for P500,000.00 to complainant.
*   **Cagatan's Defense:**
    *   The P500,000.00 was for the purchase of his shares in ISRC, not license reinstatement.
    *   He assigned his shares to Khalifa and issued the check as a guarantee in case the appeal for reinstatement was unsuccessful.

**Key Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Cagatan:** Obligated to be truthful and candid in dealings (Canon 1, Rule 1.01, Canon 7, Rule 7.03, Code of Professional Responsibility); maintain the integrity of the legal profession. Obligated under the MOA to use investment for agreed-upon purposes and to disclose material facts regarding ISRC's status.

**Liabilities:**

*   Atty. Cagatan found liable for violating the Code of Professional Responsibility due to deceit, misrepresentation, and issuing a worthless check.

**Risks:**

*   **Cagatan:** Suspension from the practice of law; ordered to restitute P500,000.00 to the complainant. This decision establishes precedent for disciplining lawyers for dishonesty in private dealings, not just professional conduct.
* **Complainant:** If the funds were used for a purpose she approved, there is risk associated with how the funds were used.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility (Canons 1, 7; Rules 1.01, 7.03):**  Forms the basis for disciplinary action against lawyers.

*   **Sanchez v. Somoso, A.C. No. 6061, October 3, 2003, 412 SCRA 569, 571:** Establishes precedent for a lawyer who pays another with a closed bank account exhibiting an extremely low regard to his commitment and oath thereby tarnishing the image of the profession which he should hold in high esteem
*   **Moreno v. Araneta, A.C. No. 1109, April 27, 2005, 457 SCRA 329, 337:** The issuance of worthless checks constitutes gross misconduct, as the effect transcends the private interests of the parties directly involved in the transaction and touches the interests of the community at large.
*   **Soriano v. Reyes, A.C. No. 4676, May 4, 2006, 489 SCRA 328, 343:** The appropriate penalty which the Court may impose on an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *true intent* behind the P500,000.00 payment. The MOA is clear on its purpose, but Cagatan presented conflicting accounts, raising ambiguity.
*   The validity and timing of the Deed of Assignment. The superimposed date casts doubt on its genuineness and intent.

**Overall Legal Analysis:**

The Supreme Court prioritized the terms of the MOA and found Cagatan's actions deceitful. His inconsistent explanations and failure to fully disclose ISRC's financial and legal challenges, coupled with the bouncing check, constituted a breach of his ethical duties. The case highlights the importance of lawyers' honesty in all dealings, not just client representation.
