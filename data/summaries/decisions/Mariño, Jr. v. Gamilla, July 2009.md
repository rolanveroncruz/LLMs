**Case:** *Eduardo J. Mari単o, Jr. vs. Gil Y. Gamilla* (G.R. No. 149763, July 7, 2009)

**Summary:**
This case involves a dispute between the Mari単o Group (former USTFU officers) and the Gamilla Group (UST faculty members) regarding the validity of a P42 million economic benefits package, a P4.2 million check-off from said package, and the conduct of union elections. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision, with modifications.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) of Sept 10, 1992:** Granted USTFU members economic benefits of P42 million, sourced from faculty members' share in incremental tuition fees as per RA 6728. This MOA created an obligation for UST to provide the stated benefits.
*   **Republic Act No. 6728 (Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education Act):** Requires private schools to allocate 70% of tuition fee increases to salaries, wages, allowances, and other benefits for teaching and non-teaching personnel.  This law informed the analysis of the benefits package.
*   **Articles 222(b), 241(n), and 241(o) of the Labor Code:** Govern attorney's fees, negotiation fees, and special assessments within labor unions.  Specifically Article 222(b) dictates that attorneys' fees may be charged against union funds only.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Mari単o Group:** Jointly and severally liable to reimburse the faculty members the P4.2 million improperly checked-off as union dues and special assessments, plus 6% interest from 15 December 1994.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Source of P42 Million:** The central issue is whether the P42 million economic benefits package was entirely derived from the 70% allotment from tuition fee increases mandated by RA 6728. The court concluded it was, based on the MOA, placing the funds under statutory, not negotiable guidelines.
*   **Legality of the Check-off:** The P4.2 million check-off was deemed illegal because:
    *   It effectively reduced the statutorily mandated 70% tuition fee allocation.
    *   The P42 million was *not* "union funds."
    *   The ratification process, which included MOA ratification with check-off authorization, vitiated the consent of the members. A distinct process of ratification by secret ballot as per USTFU By-Laws was required.
*   **Union Election Oversight:**  The issue of DOLE supervision of union elections was rendered moot because intervening elections took place.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 6728:**  Crucial in determining the permissibility of deducting attorney's fees.
*   **Labor Code Articles 222(b), 241(n), and 241(o):**  Governing attorney's fees, special assessments, and check-offs.
*   *Cebu Institute of Technology v. Ople* (G.R. No. L-58870): Cited regarding the mandatory nature of the 70% allocation under RA 6728.
*   *ABS-CBN Supervisors Employees Union Members v. ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp.* (364 Phil. 133):  Defines "check-off" and its purpose.
*    *Palacol v. Ferrer-Calleja*: Clarifies that compliance with Labor Code and By-Laws must be strictly adhered to.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The MOA Clause 7 concerning "the aggregate sum of P42 million is chargeable against the share of the faculty members in the incremental proceeds of tuition fees collected and still to be collected" served as the basis for the court's interpretation of the whole benefits package as part of the RA 6728 mandates.

**Overall:**

The case underscores the importance of complying with statutory mandates (RA 6728) in relation to tuition fee increases and the strict requirements for validly levying and checking off special assessments from union members. The Mari単o Group was held liable for improperly using funds earmarked for faculty benefits.
