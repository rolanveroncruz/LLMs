## Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Paz Macalalad vs. Rural Bank of Pola, Inc.* G.R. No. 200899

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Core Issue:** Validity of a mortgage and subsequent foreclosure sale, specifically whether Rural Bank of Pola, Inc. (Bank) was a mortgagee in good faith when it accepted a parcel of land as collateral from the Spouses Pimentel, who purportedly acquired it via a deed of sale from Leopoldo Constantino, Jr. (Leopoldo), now deceased.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **Petitioners' Claim:** Heirs of Paz Macalalad (Heirs) claim that the deed of sale between Leopoldo and the Spouses Pimentel is invalid because it was purportedly executed *after* Leopoldo's death.  Therefore, the Spouses Pimentel could not validly mortgage the property to the Bank, and the subsequent foreclosure and transfer of title to the Bank (TCT No. T-117484) is null and void.
*   **Bank's Defense:** The Bank claims it is a mortgagee in good faith, relying on the registered title of the Spouses Pimentel. They also argue a title procured through fraud can become valid if in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value.
*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court **denied** the petition, affirming the Court of Appeals (CA) decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruling. The Court found that the Bank acted in good faith as a mortgagee for value.
*   **Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet:** The court acknowledges the principle that "no one can give what one does not have," citing *Rufloe, et al. v. Burgos, et al., 597 Phil. 261, 270 (2009)* and *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Prudential Bank, 512 Phil. 267, 278 (2005).* However, this does not apply when an innocent purchaser for value is involved. The court applies the exception as found in section 32 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) 1529.

**Liabilities/Risks:**

*   **Heirs' Loss of Property:**  The Heirs lose their claim to the property.
*   **Bank's Potential Risk (Mitigated):** The Bank would have faced significant risk if it were deemed a mortgagee in bad faith, potentially losing its investment.
*   **Missing Indispensable Party:** Court emphasizes that the Heirs did not implead the Spouses Pimentel, making the issue of the validity of the deed of sale between the Spouses Pimentel and Leopoldo unresolved.
*   **General Manager Contempt:** The bank's general manager, Leonor L. Hidalgo, was fined for failing to comply with court directives.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) 1529 (Property Registration Decree), Section 32:**  Expands the definition of an innocent purchaser for value to include mortgagees and lessees.
*   **Nemo Dat Quod Non Habet:** General principle of property law. *Rufloe, et al. v. Burgos, et al., 597 Phil. 261, 270 (2009)*. *Development Bank of the Philippines v. Prudential Bank, 512 Phil. 267, 278 (2005).*
*   **Mortgagee Good Faith:** *Arguelles, et al. v. Malarayat Rural Bank, Inc., 730 Phil. 226, 237 (2014), citing Cruz v. Bancom Finance Corporation, 429 Phil. 225, 239 (2002)*
*   **Tolentino, et al. v. Sps. Latagan, et al., 761 Phil. 108, 134 (2015)** Establishes the burden of proving the status of a purchaser in good faith.
*   **Civil Service Commission v. Maala, 504 Phil. 646, 652 (2005)** Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.
*   **Spouses Francisco v. Court of Appeals, et al., 449 Phil. 632, 647 (2003)** CA affirmation of factual findings becomes conclusive and binding.
*   **Arguelles, et al. v. Malarayat Rural Bank, Inc., supra note 30, citing Ursal v. Court of Appeals, 509 Phil. 628, 642 (2005).** Higher standard of due diligence of a banking institution before entering into a mortgage contract.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of Deed of Sale:** The validity of the initial deed of sale between Leopoldo and the Spouses Pimentel remains unresolved due to the absence of the Spouses Pimentel as parties. This is a major weakness in the Heirs' case. The court's resolution of good faith side-steps this critical issue.

**Potential Legal Argument (Had Spouses Pimentel Been Involved):**

*   The core contention, if the Spouses Pimentel were impleaded, would revolve around proving or disproving the forgery of Leopoldo's signature on the deed of sale.  Expert testimony on handwriting analysis would be critical.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Heirs faced a steep uphill battle given the established precedent favoring innocent purchasers for value, especially in the context of registered land transactions. The Court's emphasis on the Bank's due diligence, supported by the RTC and CA findings, effectively shielded the Bank from liability. However, the underlying issue of the deed of sale's validity remains a latent problem, though unlikely to be resurrected given the outcome of this case and the non-joinder of the Spouses Pimentel. The bank also escaped sanctions for failure to comply with court directives, though the court did fine the general manager.
