## Legal Document Summary: Cornes v. Leal Realty Centrum Co., Inc. (G.R. No. 172146)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Review under Rule 45)

**Core Issue:** Whether Petitioners (Cornes, Robles, Gadiano) and their predecessors are *de jure* tenants of a landholding now owned by Respondents (Leal Realty Centrum Co., Inc., Leal Haven, Inc.).

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court (SC) denied the Petition, affirming the Court of Appeals (CA) decision which reinstated the Provincial Adjudicator's (PA) decision finding **no tenancy relationship.** However, the SC modified the CA ruling by directing Leal Realty to honor a compensation agreement with petitioners' predecessors.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Tenancy:** The SC reiterated the six essential elements of a tenancy relationship (landowner/tenant, agricultural land, consent, agricultural production, personal cultivation, sharing of harvest). Petitioners failed to prove all elements, particularly landowner's consent and sharing of harvest (no receipts presented, self-serving testimony only).
*   **Compensation Agreement:** Despite the lack of tenancy, Leal Realty is obligated to fulfill the terms of a 1988 compensation agreement with petitioners' predecessors (Jacinto, Pablo, Juanito, Francisco), including:
    *   Payment of the remaining balance of P46,000 (pro-rated).
    *   Transfer of a 2,500 square-meter lot as agreed.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Leal Realty:**
    *   **Liability:** Failure to pay the P46,000 balance and transfer the 2,500 square-meter lot constitutes a breach of contract, potentially leading to a separate action for specific performance and damages.
*   **Petitioners:**
    *   **Risk:**  No security of tenure under agrarian reform laws.  Future eviction is possible, subject to compliance with the compensation agreement by Leal Realty.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Central to the issue of land coverage and tenancy rights.  The sale of the land was before effectivity, hence valid.
*   **R.A. No. 3844 (Agricultural Land Reform Code):**  Cited by DARAB but not given weight by the Court.
*   **P.D. No. 27:**  Not applicable, as the land was predominantly sugar, not rice and corn.
*   **Security of Tenure Doctrine (Bernardo vs. Court of Appeals, 168 SCRA 440):**  Inapplicable because Petitioners are not *de jure* tenants.
*   **Oarde v. Court of Appeals, 345 Phil. 457:** The Secretary of Agrarian Reform's findings concerning the presence or absence of a tenancy relationship between the contending parties, are merely preliminary or provisional and are not binding upon the courts.
*   **Rules of the Court, Rule 45:** Framework under which this case was reviewed
*   **Papa v. A.U. Valencia and Co., Inc., G.R. No. 105188:** Defined Petitioners' failure to include JOSEFINA, an indispensable party, in the action.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The "Usage of Land" clause in the compensation agreement gives Leal Realty discretion over land use, potentially conflicting with Petitioners' livelihood.
*   The agreement's silence on the exact location and specifications of the 2,500 square-meter lot could lead to disputes during implementation.

**Key Legal Points:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** Petitioners failed to meet the burden of proving all elements of tenancy by substantial evidence.
*   **Self-Serving Evidence:**  Reliance on self-serving testimony without corroborating documentation (e.g., receipts) is insufficient to establish tenancy.
*   **Indispensable Party:** Failure to implead Josefina, the original landowner, was a procedural defect.
*   **DAR Secretary Jurisdiction:** Questions regarding the land's CARP coverage fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary, not the DARAB.

**Conclusion:**

While the Petitioners lost their claim to tenancy rights, Leal Realty is legally bound to comply with the terms of the compensation agreement. Further action for Specific Performance is possible should Leal Realty fail to comply.
