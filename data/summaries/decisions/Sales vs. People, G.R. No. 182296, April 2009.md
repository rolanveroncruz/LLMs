## Legal Document Summary: *Susan Sales Y Jimena v. People of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 182296

**Case Summary:** This Supreme Court decision reverses the conviction of Susan Sales y Jimena (Petitioner) for violation of Section 5, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) based on reasonable doubt. The Court found the prosecution's evidence, primarily the testimony of PO1 Teresita Reyes regarding a buy-bust operation, to be improbable and incredible. Crucially, the Court also found that the police failed to comply with the procedural safeguards regarding the chain of custody of the seized drugs.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165:**  Prohibits the unauthorized sale, dispense, delivery, transport, or distribution of dangerous drugs.
*   **Chain of Custody Requirements (R.A. 9165 implementing rules):** Strict adherence to the legal procedure and guidelines on the arrest and the confiscation of the illegal drug

**Liabilities:**

*   The Petitioner was initially convicted of violating Sec. 5, Art. II, RA 9165, carrying a penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00. The Supreme Court overturned this.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Risk of wrongful conviction:** The Court explicitly acknowledges the risk of law enforcers planting evidence in drug cases, highlighting the need for judicial vigilance.
*   **Failure to establish *corpus delicti*:**  The dangerous drug is the *corpus delicti*. Any break in the chain of custody creates doubt as to the identity and integrity of the evidence, leading to acquittal.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):**  The primary statutory basis for the charge. Section 5 specifically addresses drug pushing.
*   ***People v. Pagaura*** **(G.R. No. 95352):** Cited to demonstrate the improbability of openly selling drugs on a busy street in broad daylight. Highlights the clandestine nature of illegal drug dealings.
*   ***People v. Kimura*** **(G.R. No. 130805):** Establishes that the existence of dangerous drugs is a *sine qua non* for conviction. The drug must be the same one offered as evidence.
*   ***Malillin v. People*** **(G.R. No. 172953):**  Defines the chain of custody rule and its purpose in authenticating evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The credibility of the informant and the rationale for relying solely on his information without prior verification.
*   The ease with which the Petitioner allegedly sold the drugs to a complete stranger, raising questions about entrapment.

**Concerns regarding law enforcement procedure:** The law enforcement did not take physical inventory or photograph the sachet and buy-bust money in the presence of petitioner, her counsel, a representative from the media, or the Department of Justice.

**Conclusion:**

This decision underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural safeguards in drug cases, particularly the chain of custody rule. The court emphasizes that when these safeguards are not meticulously followed, reasonable doubt is created, requiring acquittal. It also serves as a reminder of the potential for abuse in drug enforcement and the judiciary's responsibility to protect against wrongful convictions.
