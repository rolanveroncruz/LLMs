## Legal Document Summary: Domingo V. De Guzman III vs. People of the Philippines, et al.

**Case:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari (G.R. No. 255100, G.R. No. 255229, G.R. No. 255503) regarding the parricide case against Dalia Guerrero Pastor and the murder case against Domingo V. De Guzman III and PO2 Edgar Angel related to the death of Ferdinand "Enzo" Salas Pastor.

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines, Second Division

**Date:** February 26, 2024

**Holding:** SC affirmed De Guzman's conviction, denied his petition for review; reversed the CA ruling dismissing the case against Dalia, ordered the reinstatement of the warrant of arrest and hold departure order against her.

**I. Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Probable Cause for Arrest:**  The central issue revolves around the existence of probable cause to indict Dalia for parricide and to deny De Guzman's application for bail in his murder case. The CA ruled against the trial court on probable cause for Dalia's arrest.
*   **Admissibility of Extrajudicial Confession:** The admissibility of PO2 Angel's extrajudicial confession, particularly after recantation, is a crucial point. De Guzman argues the confession, being uncounseled and recanted, is inadmissible against him under *res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet*.
*   **Conspiracy:** The existence and proof of conspiracy between Dalia, De Guzman, and PO2 Angel in the commission of the murder. CA ruled that the prosecution failed to prove conspiracy.
*   **Denial of Bail:** The propriety of the denial of De Guzman's application for bail, based on the strength of evidence presented by the prosecution that showed that he was the mastermind behind the murder. CA sustained this denial.

**II. Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Domingo V. De Guzman III:** Liable for murder. Application for bail was correctly denied.
*   **Dalia Guerrero Pastor:** Potentially liable for parricide. The SC reversed the CA's ruling dismissing the case against her, meaning the trial court can proceed with the case against her.
*   **PO2 Edgar Angel:** (Not directly addressed in this ruling, but remains liable for murder, and his conviction for the drug charge leading to his arrest was overturned.)

**III. Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Hearsay Testimony:** Nidua's testimony, a self-proclaimed gun-for-hire, is scrutinized for potential hearsay issues, particularly regarding the planning of the murder. The court, however, finds his testimony credible because he was actually present when De Guzman, Lt. Oco, and Kapitan Borbie plotted the killing of Enzo.
*   **Recanted Confession:**  PO2 Angel recanted his confession. De Guzman's defense hinged on this, asserting the confession was coerced and thus inadmissible. The SC disregarded PO2 Angel's confession during custodial investigation because it was allegedly infirm.
*   **Forum Shopping:**  Dalia initially argued the case should be dismissed due to forum shopping (attempting to admit an amended Information before another court), but this was dismissed.

**IV. Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 8 (Conspiracy), Art. 248 (Murder).
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 45 (Petitions for Review on Certiorari), Rule 112 Section 5(a) (actions available after filling of a criminal complaint), Rule 114 Sections 4, 6, 7, and 8 (bail).
*   **Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 2** (right against unreasonable searches and seizures), **Sec. 12** (rights during custodial investigation), **Sec. 13** (right to bail).
*   **Republic Act No. 10591:** Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act.
*   **Republic Act No. 9165:** Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.
*   **Key Cases:**
    *   *People v. Aringue*, 347 Phil. 571, 579-580 (1997) [Per J. Puno, Second Division]: held that positive identification by witnesses is sufficient even without a valid confession.
    *   *People v. Andan*, 336 Phil. 91 (1997) [Per Curiam, En Banc]: Admissibility of public admissions of culpability, not extracted under custodial investigation.
    *   *People v. Dacanay*, 798, Phil. 132 (2016) [Per J. Caguio First Division]: Admissibility of extrajudicial confession given during interview with reporters.
    *   *People v. Cabral*, 362 Phil. 697 (1999) [Per .T Romero, Third Division]: Evident proof of guilt.

**V. Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "probable cause" and the extent to which the trial court must independently evaluate evidence versus relying on the prosecutor's determination.
*   The weight given to circumstantial evidence in establishing conspiracy, particularly in the absence of direct evidence implicating Dalia.

**VI. Summary for the Lawyer:**

This case concerns the murder of Enzo Pastor. The Supreme Court reviewed the CA's dismissal of the parricide case against Dalia Guerrero Pastor and affirmed the denial of Domingo De Guzman III's bail application in his murder case, both connected to Enzo's death. Critical issues are the existence of probable cause, the admissibility of PO2 Angel's recanted confession, and the establishment of conspiracy. The SC reversed the CA on Dalia's case, emphasizing that the totality of circumstantial evidence, including her relationship with De Guzman, her presence at planning meetings, and PO2 Angel's testimonies (especially his uncounseled television interview), creates a probable cause for parricide, warranting the reinstatement of the lower court's order for her arrest. The lawyer should focus on the admissibility of different pieces of evidence such as PO2's recanted confession, as well as the strength of circumstantial evidence presented. This case is an affirmation that public admission of guilt is admissible in evidence.
