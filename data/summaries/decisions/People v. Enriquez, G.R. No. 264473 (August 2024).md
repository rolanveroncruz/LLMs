**Case:** People of the Philippines v. Lucky Enriquez y Casipi, G.R. No. 264473, August 07, 2024

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court *reversed* the Court of Appeals' decision and *acquitted* Lucky Enriquez y Casipi ("Enriquez") of illegal possession of dangerous drugs (Section 11, RA 9165) and drug paraphernalia (Section 12, RA 9165) due to an *invalid search warrant* and *improper execution* by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). The court held that the evidence seized was inadmissible under Article III, Section 3(2) of the Constitution, as it was the "fruit of a poisonous tree."

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Right Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure (Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution):** The core legal issue revolves around the protection of individual privacy and the limitations placed on government intrusion. The court emphasizes the presumption of innocence and the burden on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Validity of the Search Warrant:** The Court found Search Warrant No. 5368 (2017) invalid because it *failed to particularly describe the place to be searched*. The address "Informal Settler's Compound, NIA Road, Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City" was considered too broad and amounted to a *general warrant*, prohibited under the Constitution, because it gave the PDEA agents free reign to search every place within the Informal Settlers Compound in NIA Road. Further the court also noted the missing attached sketch map, and that the government agents were only able to locate accused-appellantâ€™s house through the confidential informant's assistance.
*   **Execution of the Search Warrant:** The execution was deemed improper due to the PDEA agents' failure to comply with Rule 126, Sections 7 and 8 of the Rules of Court (the "knock and announce" rule and presence of witnesses, respectively). The agents *entered unannounced* and *without seeking permission*, and further did not follow the proper witness requirements, violating both the spirit and letter of the law.

**Obligations:**

*   Government agents have a strict obligation to obtain valid search warrants based on *probable cause* and *particular descriptions* (place and items).
*   Compliance with Rule 126, Sections 7 and 8 of the Rules of Court regarding proper execution of search warrants. This includes announcing presence, authority, and purpose before entry ("knock and announce"), and conducting the search in the presence of the lawful occupant or designated witnesses.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   Evidence obtained through illegal searches and seizures is *inadmissible* in court, rendering prosecutions based on such evidence untenable.
*   Government agents face potential *criminal and civil liabilities* for violating constitutional rights.
*   Failure to adhere to procedural rules (Rule 126) can lead to *acquittal* of the accused, even if evidence suggests guilt.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article III, Sections 2 & 3(2) of the 1987 Constitution:** Guarantees the right against unreasonable searches and seizures and the inadmissibility of illegally obtained evidence.
*   **Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Sections 11 & 12:** Defines the crimes of illegal possession of dangerous drugs and drug paraphernalia.
*   **Rule 126, Sections 4, 7 & 8 of the Rules of Court:** Governs the issuance and execution of search warrants.
*   **Zafe III v. People, 901 Phil. 716 (2021):** Emphasizes the right to privacy and the presumption of innocence in criminal prosecutions.
*   **People v. Huang Zhen Hua, 482 Phil. 572 (2004):** Discusses the requirements for the valid execution of a search warrant, including the "knock and announce" principle.
*   **Diaz v. People, 877 Phil. 523 (2020):** Defines what meets the particularity requirement.
*    **People v. Policarpio, 894 Phil. 427 (2021):** Defines what meets the particularity requirement.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The description of the place to be searched in Search Warrant No. 5368 (2017) ("Informal Settler's Compound, NIA Road, Barangay Pinyahan, Quezon City") was contentious.  The court considered this too broad and a violation of the particularity requirement.
*   The validity of the PDEA agents' unannounced entry was disputed.  The prosecution argued that Enriquez's attempt to escape justified the lack of announcement, but the Court disagreed.

**Conclusion:**

This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to constitutional safeguards and procedural rules in law enforcement. The invalid search warrant and improper execution resulted in the exclusion of evidence and the acquittal of the accused. It serves as a warning to law enforcement agencies about the consequences of violating individual rights in the pursuit of criminal prosecution.
