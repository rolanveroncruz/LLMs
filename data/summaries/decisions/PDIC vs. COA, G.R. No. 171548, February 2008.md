## Legal Document Summary: *Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation vs. Commission on Audit*, G.R. No. 171548

**Core Issue:** Whether COA committed grave abuse of discretion in disallowing PDIC's condonation of a previously disallowed disbursement (BPDEE and gift checks) to former Finance Secretary De Ocampo, which disallowance had been affirmed with finality by the Supreme Court in a prior case (G.R. No. 155317).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **PDIC Charter, Sec. 8, par. 12:** PDIC's purported authority to "compromise, condone or release" claims, used as justification for condonation. This is juxtaposed against its mandate "to protect the interest of the Corporation".
*   **COA Rules (1997 Revised Rules of Procedure), Rule XII:** Outlines execution of decisions, notification of liable persons, and withholding of money due. Specifically, it details the auditor's duty to direct refunds and the process for non-compliance, potentially leading to contempt, civil suit by the Solicitor General, or administrative/criminal action.
*   **Final Order of Adjudication (FOA):** Served as the equivalent of a writ of execution for the audit disallowance.
*   **PDIC Resolution No. 2003-09-157:** Resolution attempting to condone the previously disallowed disbursement after Supreme Court's final ruling.

**Liabilities:**

*   PDIC officials potentially liable for failing to comply with the Final Order of Adjudication and the Supreme Court's final decision, which could lead to actions recommended by the Auditor under the COA Rules.
*   Roberto De Ocampo remains liable for the disallowed disbursement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Potential legal action against PDIC officials:** COA referred the matter to the OSG to file suit against PDIC officials for non-compliance with the Supreme Court's decision and the FOA.
*   **Weakening of res judicata:** Allowing PDIC's condonation would effectively circumvent the final and executory judgment of the Supreme Court.
*   **Setting a precedent for circumventing audit disallowances:** Sanctioning PDIC's condonation could encourage other government entities to disregard final audit decisions through similar maneuvers.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **G.R. No. 155317 (Prior PDIC v. COA case):** Established the finality of the disallowance of the BPDEE and gift checks, forming the basis for res judicata in this case.
*   **Philippine Constitution, Article VII, Section 13:** Rule against multiple positions and double compensation.
*   **R.A. No. 3591, Section 2(9):** Relates to multiple positions and double compensation (cited in the original Notice of Disallowance).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **PDIC Charter, Sec. 8, par. 12 ("to protect the interest of the Corporation"):**  PDIC argued this clause authorized their condonation, however, the Supreme Court interpreted that the authority does not extend to condoning liabilities arising from violations of the Constitution or law and that it is not in the best interest of the PDIC to perpetuate breaches of law.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **PDIC:** Claims it was denied due process because it didn't receive notice of the COA Supervising Auditor's Memorandum disallowing the condonation, thus depriving it of its right to appeal.  PDIC also maintained that their Charter granted them authority to condone the settled liability.
*   **COA:** Argues that res judicata bars PDIC's attempt to appeal the disallowance of the condonation, as the validity of the original disallowance was already affirmed by the Supreme Court. Further, the COA argued that the Auditor's Memorandum was not appealable, that PDIC Charter does not authorize condonation, and that the condonation violated the constitutional prohibition against double compensation.

**Ruling:**

The Supreme Court **DISMISSED** PDIC's petition, upholding COA's disallowance of the condonation. The Court found that PDIC was not denied due process, that the final and executory judgment in G.R. No. 155317 was immutable, and that the attempted condonation was an indirect violation of the prohibition against double compensation.

**Potential Further Issues:**

*   The OSG's potential action against PDIC officials remains a concern.
*   The interpretation of PDIC's charter regarding the scope of its condonation powers is now firmly established by this case.
