**Case Summary: *Security Bank and Trust Company v. Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation* G.R. No. 170984 & 170987 (2009)**

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions for review on certiorari regarding liability for a dishonored manager's check.

**Facts:** SBTC issued a manager's check for P8M payable to "CASH" as loan proceeds to GCDC. CMC deposited the check into its RCBC account and RCBC immediately honored it. GCDC then issued a stop payment order claiming mistaken release of the check. SBTC dishonored the check. After back-and-forth returns and debits/credits, RCBC sued SBTC for damages. A temporary arrangement resulted in the P8M being split between the two banks. RTC ruled in favor of RCBC for P4M actual damages and attorney's fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed with modification, adding interest, but deleting attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Manager's Check:** A manager's check, as SBTC's own check, becomes the primary obligation of the bank and is accepted in advance by the act of its issuance, similar to a certified check. *International Corporate Bank v. Gueco*. RCBC relied on the integrity of the manager's check when crediting CMC's account.
*   **Holder in Due Course:** Although the case argues RCBC's status as a holder in due course, the Court rules that where the check appears regular on its face, and the bank found nothing unusual in the transaction, the bank is not at fault.
*   **Monetary Board Resolution No. 2202 & July 9, 1980 Memorandum:** While MB Resolution No. 2202 prohibits drawings against uncollected deposits, the subsequent July 9, 1980 Memorandum gives banks discretion to allow immediate drawings on uncollected deposits of manager's checks. RCBC exercised its prerogative by allowing the withdrawal.
*   **Section 61 NIL Liability of Drawer:** Regardless of the Memorandum, SBTC as drawer admits the existence of the payee and undertakes that the instrument will be accepted or paid. SBTC remains liable to RCBC.
*   **Damages:**
    *   **Actual Damages:** The remaining P4M is affirmed.
    *   **Interest:** Legal interest of 6% per annum from filing of the complaint is awarded, based on Articles 2200 and 2209 of the Civil Code, as awarded by the Court of Appeals.
    *   **Exemplary Damages:** Awarded in the amount of P50,000.00, for the public good due to the public interest in the banking system. *Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Roxas*.
    *   **Attorney's Fees:** Awarded in the amount of P25,000.00 because of the exemplary damages.

**Obligations:**

*   SBTC is obligated to pay RCBC the remaining P4 million, plus legal interest, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.

**Liabilities:**

*   SBTC is liable for breach of its obligations as the drawer of a manager's check. The dishonor of the check was a breach.
*   The bank bears responsibility for upholding public trust in the banking system, and failure to do so can result in liability for exemplary damages.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on internal bank policies regarding "stop payment" orders:** SBTC's defense relies on the argument that it properly honored the stop payment order. However, this is insufficient to release the bank from the liabilities from the manager's check.
*   **Precedent for Damages:** This case reinforces the potential for liability beyond mere actual damages, including exemplary damages and attorney's fees, when banks act in bad faith or with gross negligence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The *holder in due course* aspect is implicitly abandoned.
*   The ruling implies that internal CB circulars can shift liability.
