Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision in *People v. Gonzales*, G.R. No. 180448.

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, which upheld the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Budoy Gonzales y Lacdang for Destructive Arson under Article 320 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended by P.D. No. 1613 and R.A. No. 7659). Gonzales was sentenced to *reclusion perpetua*.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Gonzales was charged with and convicted of destructive arson for intentionally setting fire to the house of Salvacion Loresto. The house served as a dwelling, store, and boarding house located in a populated area.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution's case rested primarily on the testimony of Salvacion Loresto, the victim and sole eyewitness. She identified Gonzales as the person who threatened to burn her house and subsequently set it on fire.
*   **Corpus Delicti:** The Court found that the prosecution established the *corpus delicti* of arson. The testimony of Salvacion, coupled with the damage to her house, sufficiently proved that a fire occurred and that it was intentionally caused.  The court cited *People v. Gutierrez, 327 Phil. 679, 685 (1996)*, for the principle that even uncorroborated testimony of a single eyewitness may be enough to prove corpus delicti and to warrant conviction.
*   **Credibility of Witness:** The Court emphasized the trial court's advantage in assessing the credibility of witnesses, reiterating that its findings on credibility are binding on appellate courts absent any significant overlooked fact. (Citing: Bricenio v. People, G.R. No. 157804, 20 June 2006, 491 SCRA 489, 496)
*   **Defense of Alibi:** The defense's alibi was rejected. The court noted it was not physically impossible for the defendant to be at the scene of the crime. (Citing: People v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 141599, 29 June 2004, 433 SCRA 102, 116)
*   **Inconsistencies in Testimony:** Minor inconsistencies in the victim's testimony were deemed insignificant and not detrimental to her credibility, instead strengthening the case. (Citing: Salvador v. People, 463 SCRA 489, 502.)
*   **Photographic Evidence:** Photographs presented by the defense were disregarded due to lack of proper authentication and identification, preventing probative value. (Citing: Sison v. People, 320 Phil. 112, 131 (1995).)
*   **Penalty:** The penalty of *reclusion perpetua* was correctly imposed under Article 320(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 10 of R.A. No. 7659.
*   **Damages:** The award of actual damages was deleted due to the lack of competent proof demonstrating the actual amount of loss. (Citing: People v. Pansensooy, 437 Phil. 499, 523 (2002).)

**Obligations:**

*   The appellant, Gonzales, is obligated to serve the sentence of *reclusion perpetua*.

**Liabilities:**

*   Gonzales is liable for the crime of destructive arson.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Sole Eyewitness:** The case hinges heavily on the testimony of a single eyewitness. Although the court found her credible, reliance on a single witness always presents a potential point of attack, although it did give credence to the testimony of the witness
*   **Lack of Corroboration:** While corroboration isn't strictly required for the *corpus delicti*, its absence might be argued to weaken the overall proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant raised this concern.
*   **Police Blotter:** The police blotter, though not formally offered in evidence, was mentioned by the trial court as corroborating the victim's testimony. This reliance, even indirectly, could be challenged as relying on evidence not properly before the court.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutes:**

*   **Revised Penal Code, Article 320 (as amended by P.D. No. 1613 and R.A. No. 7659):**  Defines and penalizes Destructive Arson.
*   ***People v. Gutierrez, 327 Phil. 679, 685 (1996)***: Single eyewitness testimony can establish corpus delicti.
*   ***People v. Gonzales, G.R. No. 141599, 29 June 2004, 433 SCRA 102, 116***: Case law regarding requirements to validate the defense of alibi.

**Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The appellant argued inconsistencies weakened the prosecution's case.
*   The appellant raised doubt, which could be argued as a challenge of reasonable doubt.
