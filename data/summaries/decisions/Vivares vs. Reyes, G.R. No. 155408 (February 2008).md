Okay, here's a legal summary of *Julio A. Vivares and Mila G. Ignaling vs. Engr. Jose J. Reyes*, G.R. No. 155408, February 13, 2008, in markdown format:

**Case Summary: *Vivares v. Reyes*, G.R. No. 155408 (2008)**

**Core Issue:** Propriety of the RTC's appointment of a receiver over the estate of Severino Reyes, in an action for Partition and Recovery of Real Estate (Civil Case No. 517).

**Facts:**

*   Severino Reyes's estate became subject to dispute between his sons, Jose Reyes (Respondent) and Torcuato Reyes (deceased, represented by Petitioners).
*   Prior to Torcuato's death, an oral partition of the estate occurred, and each son separately appropriated properties.
*   Petitioners filed suit claiming Torcuato didn't receive his fair share. The litigation focused on properties still in Severino's name.
*   Petitioners moved for receivership alleging Respondent fraudulently transferred properties without court approval and antedated transfers to exclude them from the estate under litigation and was exclusively enjoying the fruits and income of said properties and without rendering an accounting on them and turning over the share pertaining to Torcuato.
*   The RTC initially granted the receivership but was later reversed by the CA.

**Holding/Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's reversal of the RTC's receivership order, but modified it regarding the notice of lis pendens.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Receivership Standard:** The Court reiterates the stringent standard for appointing a receiver, as articulated in *Velasco & Co. v. Gochuico & Co.*, 28 Phil. 39 (1914):  Receivership is a "delicate" remedy, to be exercised with "extreme caution" only in cases requiring "summary relief" or "imminent danger of loss."  The Court emphasizes that receivership is *not* an absolute right and should not cause "irreparable injustice or injury."
*   **Fraud Allegations:** The Court found that Petitioners failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of fraudulent transfers by Respondent. The mere fact of transfers predating Torcuato's death is insufficient to establish fraud.  The burden of proof for fraud rests on the party alleging it.
*   **Oral Partition:** The Court recognized the prior oral partition between Jose and Torcuato, and the fact that Torcuato also conveyed properties based on said verbal arrangement. Petitioners are estopped from challenging the validity of the oral partition and the conveyances made pursuant to it. The civil action does not encompass the properties covered by the oral partition.
*   **Counterbond:** The CA considered the posting of a counterbond by Respondent (per Rule 59, Sec. 3 of the Rules of Civil Procedure) as a factor supporting the discharge of the receiver. The Court clarified that under Rule 59, Sec. 3, the posting of a counterbond is not a *mandatory* ground for discharging a receiver; the trial court retains discretion. The word "may" is construed as permissive.
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens:** The Court acknowledges that the annotation of a notice of lis pendens adequately safeguards Petitioners' rights by putting subsequent transferees on notice of the pending litigation.  This diminishes the necessity for a receiver. Cites *Medelo v. Gorospe*, 159 SCRA 248 (1988).
*   **Possession:**  The Court gives weight to Respondent's actual possession of some of the disputed properties, citing Article 539 of the Civil Code, which protects a possessor's right to be respected in their possession.  Cites *Descallar v. Court of Appeals*, 224 SCRA 566 (1993), which states receivership is not proper where the rights of parties, one of whom is in possession, are still to be determined.
*   **Lis Pendens Cancellation (TD No. 112):** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA's order to cancel the *lis pendens* on Tax Declaration No. 112 insofar as it covered a portion allegedly belonging to Elena Unchuan. The determination of whether Unchuan's property is part of Lot No. 33 and whether that portion belongs to Unchuan are matters to be determined by the trial court.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent is obligated to post a counterbond in the amount of Php 100,000 to cover damages to petitioners.
* The case is remanded to the court a quo for further proceedings in Civil Case No. 517.

**Liabilities:**

*   Potential liability for damages to Petitioners, limited by the amount of the counterbond, should it be determined that the transfers were indeed fraudulent and prejudiced Torcuato's estate.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The oral partition is a potential area of contention. While recognized by the Court, its terms and validity could be challenged further in the remanded proceedings, potentially impacting the rights of all parties, and especially third party purchasers.
*   The precise boundaries and ownership of Lot No. 33 (especially concerning Unchuan's alleged portion) must be definitively resolved by the trial court. The lack of clarity here creates uncertainty and could lead to further disputes.
*   The fact that the court has acknowledged that the case is being remanded for further proceedings means that additional evidence can be brought forward, and the court may come to a different conclusion based on this additional evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (Petition for Review on Certiorari)
*   Rule 59 of the Rules of Civil Procedure (Receivership)
    *   Section 3 (Denial of application or discharge of receiver)
*   Article 539 of the Civil Code (Possession)
