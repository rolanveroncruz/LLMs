**Legal Document Summary: Ilusorio v. Ilusorio, G.R. No. 210475**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing CA Resolutions dismissing a Petition for Certiorari against an RTC Order denying a Motion to Quash in a libel case.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**
*   The core issue is the existence of probable cause for libel based on excerpts from the book "On the Edge of Heaven."
*   The RTC initially found probable cause for the issuance of warrants of arrest against the petitioners, based on the Secretary of Justiceâ€™s resolution.
*   The RTC denied the Motion to Quash based on jurisdictional issues (place of publication and residence of offended party) and failure to state a cause of action (omission of the book as part of the information) and prescription.
*   Petitioners filed a Petition for Certiorari before the CA, seeking injunctive relief and assailing the RTC Order.
*   The CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari because Petitioners sought injunctive relief sans the requisite principal action for the nullification of any issuances rendered by the RTC.

**Liabilities:**
*   Petitioners were initially charged with libel under the Revised Penal Code. This liability depends on the content of the book and its alleged defamatory nature.
*   Liability extends to the author (Erlinda Ilusorio) and, potentially, the officers of the publishing foundation (PI-EKI Foundation) who circulated the book.
*   The issue revolves around whether the statements in the book caused discredit to Sylvia Ilusorio.

**Potential Risks:**
*   Potential for reinstatement of the libel charges if the CA resolves the case on the merits and finds against the petitioners.
*   Risk of civil liability for damages arising from the alleged libelous statements.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Used for Petition for Certiorari to the CA.
*   **Revised Penal Code (Libel):** Defines the elements of libel and the penalties.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 7, Section 2(c):**  Discusses the requirement to specify the relief sought in a pleading, including the allowance of a general prayer for other equitable relief.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**
*   **Jurisdictional Allegations:** The Information's failure to explicitly allege the victim's residence and place of publication raised jurisdictional questions, subject to Art. 360 of the Revised Penal Code which stipulates venue for libel cases.
*   **Sufficiency of the Information:** The omission of the book itself as an exhibit could be challenged as affecting the sufficiency of the information and establishing the defamatory character of the publication.
*   **General Prayer:** Whether the general prayer for "other legal and equitable reliefs" can be interpreted to include a specific request for the nullification of the RTC Order. The Supreme Court cited *Spouses Gutierrez v. Spouses Valiente, et al.*, 579 Phil. 486 (2008), supporting a broad interpretation of the general prayer.

**Key Outcome of SC Decision:**
* The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the Petition for Review on Certiorari. The SC held that the CA erred in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari based on a mere technicality (failure to explicitly pray for nullification of the RTC Order), as the substance of the petition clearly sought such relief.
* The case was REMANDED to the CA to resolve the petition on the merits.
* The SC noted that the DOJ Resolutions finding probable cause for libel had already been annulled by the CA in separate proceedings, which led to the withdrawal of the Information by the trial court. However, this withdrawal is subject to a pending petition for certiorari before the CA filed by Sylvia Ilusorio.
