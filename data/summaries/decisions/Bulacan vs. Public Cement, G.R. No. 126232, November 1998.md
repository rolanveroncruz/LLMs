Okay, here's a legal summary of *Province of Bulacan v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. 126232, November 27, 1998)*, formatted in Markdown:

**Case:** *Province of Bulacan v. Court of Appeals, Public Cement Corporation*

**Citation:** 359 Phil. 779 (1998)

**Summary:**

This case involves a dispute over the Province of Bulacan's authority to levy taxes on quarry resources (limestone, shale, silica) extracted from privately owned lands. The Province, through Provincial Ordinance No. 3 (Revenue Code of Bulacan), Section 21, sought to impose a 10% tax on the fair market value of extracted quarry resources. Public Cement Corporation ("RCC") challenged this, arguing the Province lacked the authority to tax resources from *private* land.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Provincial Ordinance No. 3, Section 21:** Imposes a 10% tax on quarry resources extracted from *public* lands or public waters.
*   **Local Government Code (LGC), Sec. 138:** Grants provinces the authority to tax quarry resources extracted from *public* lands and public waters.
*   **Local Government Code, Sec 133 (h):** Restricts taxing powers of local government units.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), Sec. 151:** Imposes excise tax on minerals, mineral products and quarry resources.

**Liabilities & Assessments:**

*   The Province assessed RCC PHP 2,524,692.13 for quarry extraction from private lands (3Q 1992 - 2Q 1993).
*   RCC paid PHP 1,262,346.00 (50% of the assessment) *under protest* to lift a warrant of levy.

**Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court (affirming the Court of Appeals) ruled that **the Province of Bulacan lacked the legal authority to impose taxes on quarry resources extracted from *private* lands.** The tax assessment against RCC was declared null and void. The Petition was dismissed.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **Scope of Taxing Power:** While the LGC (Section 186) allows provinces to levy taxes beyond those specifically enumerated, this power is limited.
2.  **Excise Tax Limitation (LGC Sec 133 (h)):** The tax imposed by Bulacan is effectively an excise tax. Local government units are prohibited from imposing excise taxes on items already taxed under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).
3.  **NIRC Sec. 151:** The NIRC levies a tax on *all* quarry resources, irrespective of whether they are extracted from public or private land. This preempts the province's ability to impose an additional tax on private land extraction.
4.  **Interpretation of Provincial Ordinance No. 3:** Even if Section 133 of the LGC is disregarded, Section 21 of Provincial Ordinance No. 3 only applies to resources extracted from *public* lands.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Reliance on Ultra Vires Assessment:** Any province relying on similar ordinances to tax quarry resources from private lands faces the risk of legal challenge and invalidation of the tax assessment.
*   **Misinterpretation of Local Taxing Powers:** Local governments must carefully consider the limitations imposed by the LGC and NIRC when enacting revenue-generating ordinances.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** The province may be forced to return the portion of the tax paid under protest.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Martinez vs. CA, 237 SCRA 575 (1994)* (cited for the proper remedy against a final order).
*   *Republic v. IAC, 196 SCRA 335 (1991)* (cited for the principle that tax statutes are construed strictissimi juris against the government).

**Statutory References:**

*   Local Government Code (RA 7160), specifically Sections 129, 133, 134, 138 and 186.
*   National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), specifically Section 151.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

* The interpretation of Section 186 of the Local Government Code regarding the power of local government units to levy taxes on items not specifically enumerated in the Code. Although the Court of Appeals initially erred in concluding that a province can only impose taxes specifically mentioned under the Local Government Code, the same was later amended.
