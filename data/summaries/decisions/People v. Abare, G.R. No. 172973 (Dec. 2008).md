## Legal Document Summary: People v. Abare, G.R. No. 172973 (2008)

**Case Summary:** This is an appeal of a conviction for murder. The lower courts found Marcelino Abare guilty of killing Samson Cuyogan with a scythe, qualified by treachery, and sentenced him to *reclusion perpetua*. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the conviction and modified the awarded damages.

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Crime:** Murder (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code).
*   **Circumstances:** The accused struck the victim with a scythe, severing the victim's neck from behind while the victim was seated, talking with others. Witnesses observed the accused standing behind the victim immediately after the attack, holding the bloodied scythe.
*   **Defense:** The accused claimed self-defense/impulse, alleging an argument over wages and a struggle for the scythe. He claims he never intended to kill the victim.
*   **Conviction:** The RTC and CA found the accused guilty of murder due to the presence of treachery.
*   **Appeal:** The appeal questioned the proof beyond reasonable doubt for murder and the presence of treachery.

**Key Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Defendant (Marcelino Abare):** Found guilty of murder and is obligated to serve a sentence of *reclusion perpetua*. He is also ordered to pay civil indemnity (P50,000), moral damages (P50,000), and exemplary damages (P25,000) to the victim's heirs.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The primary point of contention is the presence of treachery. The accused relied on *People v. Lug-aw*, arguing that because no witness directly observed the initial act of hacking, treachery cannot be appreciated. The SC distinguished *Lug-aw* based on factual differences, noting the eyewitnesses in this case witnessed the immediate aftermath of the attack.
*   **Mitigating Circumstances:** The defense argued for the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong/sufficient provocation. The court held that voluntary surrender was immaterial because the penalty of reclusion perpetua would still be imposed. Furthermore, lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong cannot be appreciated in cases of murder qualified by treachery. The reply of the victim "Problema mo 'yan, hindi ko problema yan" was held to be insufficient provocation.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. Lug-aw, G.R. No. 85735 (1994):** Distinguished from the current case, as the witness in *Lug-aw* did not witness the beginning of the assault.
*   **People v. Castor, G.R. No. 93664 (1992):**  Treachery was not present in *Castor* due to multiple stab wounds. The SC distinguished this case.
*   **United States v. Perdon, 4 Phil. 141 (1905) and United States v. Pangilion, 34 Phil. 786 (1916):**  Treachery was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The SC distinguished this case.
*   **People v. Pajenado, 161 Phil. 233 (1976):** The mitigating circumstance of no intention to commit so grave a wrong cannot be appreciated in cases of murder qualified by treachery
*   **People v. Segobre, G.R. No. 169877 (2008):** Civil indemnity for the crime of murder.
*   **People v. Ortiz, 413 Phil. 592 (2001):** Moral damages for the crime of murder.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines and penalizes murder.
*   **Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code:** Rules for the application of indivisible penalties.
*   **Article 14 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines treachery.

**Analysis and Potential Arguments:**

*   The SC's ruling hinges on the suddenness of the attack and the victim's inability to defend himself, establishing treachery. An argument could be made that circumstantial evidence, while strong, isn't definitive proof of how the attack began.
*   The denial of mitigating circumstances seems consistent with established jurisprudence.
*   The awarding of exemplary damages is standard given the finding of an aggravating circumstance (treachery).

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Marcelino Abare for murder, qualified by treachery, sentencing him to *reclusion perpetua* and ordering him to pay damages to the victim's heirs. The court considered the arguments presented in the appeal but ultimately found that the evidence and established jurisprudence supported the lower courts' findings.
