**Legal Document Summary: *Plus Builders, Inc. vs. Atty. Anastacio E. Revilla, Jr., A.C. No. 7056***

**Type:** Resolution on Motion for Reconsideration of a Disciplinary Action against a Lawyer.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Original Decision:** Atty. Revilla was initially found guilty of gross misconduct, including:
    *   Willful and intentional falsehood before the court.
    *   Misuse of court procedure to delay execution of judgment (specifically the DARAB decision in favor of Plus Builders).
    *   Collaboration with non-lawyers in the illegal practice of law.
*   **Original Penalty:** Two-year suspension from the practice of law.
*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** Atty. Revilla argued that his actions were based on good faith reliance on his clients' representations and a valid legal theory to protect their rights. He also denied the unauthorized practice of law, explaining his office-sharing arrangement. He pleaded for a reduced penalty due to family circumstances and his pro bono work.
*   **Modified Decision:** The Court *Partially Granted* the motion for reconsideration, reducing the suspension from two years to six months.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Revilla:**
    *   Obligation to uphold truth and justice, even when zealously representing a client. (Cites *Code of Professional Responsibility*).
    *   Obligation to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.
    *   Subject to a six-month suspension from the practice of law, effective upon receipt of the Resolution.
    *   Obligation to inform the Court of the date of his receipt of the Resolution within ten days.
*   **Implicit Obligations (General Legal Principles):**
    *   Lawyers must not unduly delay cases.
    *   Lawyers must not misuse court processes.
    *   Lawyers must not engage in or facilitate the unauthorized practice of law.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Future Violations:** Atty. Revilla is warned that any repetition of similar acts will be dealt with more severely. This creates a risk of future, potentially harsher, disciplinary actions.
*   **Impact on Notarial Commission:** While the OBC letter regarding clearance for renewal of his notarial commission was "noted", the suspension likely impacts eligibility for renewal.
*   **Reputational Damage:** The disciplinary action, even with the reduced suspension, likely has a negative impact on Atty. Revilla's professional reputation.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Professional Responsibility:** Directly cited and forms the basis for the disciplinary action related to delaying tactics and misuse of court processes.
*   **Santiago v. Fojas, A.C. No, 4103, September 7, 1995, 248 SCRA 68, 75-76.:** Duty of a lawyer to give full attention, diligence, skill and competence to the case.

*    **Plus Builders, Inc. v. Garcia, A.C. No. 7056, September 13, 2006, 501 SCRA 615, 625.:** Lawyers have the duty to present every remedy or defense within the authority of the law.
*    **Ali v. Bubong, A.C. No. 4018, March 8, 2005, 453 SCRA 220.:** Obligation, however, is not to be performed at the expense of truth and justice.
*   **Ramos v. Pallugna, A.C. No. 5908, October 25, 2004, 441 SCRA 220.:** Duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice, and is enjoined from unduly delaying a case.
*   **Rayos v. Hernandez, G.R. No. 169079, August 28, 2007, 531 SCRA 477.:** mitigating factors

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Good Faith Reliance" Argument:** Atty. Revilla's argument that he acted in good faith based on his clients' representations was ultimately not fully accepted as justification, although it contributed to the reduction in penalty. The extent to which an attorney can rely on client representations without independent verification remains a potential point of contention in similar cases.
*   **Unauthorized Practice of Law:** The resolution doesn't provide specific details on the evidence supporting this charge. This could be a weak point if the evidence was circumstantial or based solely on the shared office space. However, the Court did not fully exonerate him on this charge.

**Overall Assessment:**

The document reflects a disciplinary action against an attorney for zealous representation that crossed the line into unethical behavior. While the Court showed leniency due to mitigating factors, the six-month suspension serves as a significant sanction and a warning against similar conduct. The case highlights the ethical obligations of lawyers to balance zealous advocacy with their duty to the court and the administration of justice.
