## Legal Document Summary: Espanto v. Belleza, A.C. No. 10756

**Subject:** Disciplinary action against Atty. Erwin V. Belleza for grave misconduct, malpractice, deliberate falsehood, violation of oath of office and violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

**Parties:**
*   **Complainant:** Junielito R. Espanto
*   **Respondent:** Atty. Erwin V. Belleza

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   Atty. Belleza represented Nelia Alibangbang-Miller in a property dispute (Civil Case No. 75) involving alleged encroachment by Espanto's house.
*   Atty. Belleza sent a notice to Espanto to vacate Nelia's property while Civil Case No. 75 was still pending.
*   Atty. Belleza witnessed and signed an acknowledgment receipt indicating Espanto received partial payment for the sale of his "house," promising to inform him of final sale details.
*   Atty. Belleza facilitated, drafted and notarized the Deed of Absolute Sale between Nelia and Irene Tano, without informing Espanto as agreed.
*   Espanto's house was demolished without his knowledge, consent, or demolition permit.
*   Atty. Belleza claimed in a counter-affidavit that Civil Case No. 75 was decided with finality, which was false.
*   Civil Case No. 75 had a compromise agreement dependent on a relocation survey, which was not conducted before the sale and demolition.

**Liabilities and Violations:**

*   **Violation of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR):** Failure to uphold the Constitution, obey laws, and promote respect for legal processes. Specifically, deprived Junielito of the right to a fair trial for property rights.
*   **Violation of Canon 19 of the CPR:** Failure to represent client (Nelia) within the bounds of the law. Did not follow all parts of the agreed upon compromise agreement.
*   **Malpractice and Gross Misconduct:** Facilitating a sale and demolition in violation of a compromise agreement and due process.
*   **Misrepresentation:** False statement in counter-affidavit regarding finality of Civil Case No. 75.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Validity of the Acknowledgment Receipt:**  Atty. Belleza argued he merely witnessed the receipt, but the Court found it evidence of his knowledge of Espanto's interest and his agreement to inform Espanto of the sale.  The receipt's enforceability as a contract is questionable, but it is used as evidence of knowledge and intent.
*   **Reliance on Compromise Agreement:**  Atty. Belleza's defense hinges on the existence of a Compromise Agreement, but the Court highlights that the conditions of the agreement (relocation survey) were not met. Also notes that there should have been special notification prior to the demolition of the house.
*   **Participation in Demolition:** While Atty. Belleza denies direct involvement in the demolition, the Court infers liability based on his facilitation of the sale that led to the demolition without due process.
*   **Lack of Demolition Order and Permit:** This absence highlights the procedural impropriety and potential violation of due process rights.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Canon 1 and Canon 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:**  Form the basis of the disciplinary action.
*   **Section 27, Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of Court:**  Provides the grounds for disbarment or suspension.
*   **Rule 39, Section 10(d) of the Rules of Court:** Governs the removal of improvements on property subject to execution and states that a special order is required before demolishing property.
*   **Article 19 of the Civil Code:** States the every person must act with justice, give everyone their due, and observe honesty and good faith.

**Outcome:**

*   Atty. Belleza found GUILTY of violating Canons 1 and 19 of the CPR.
*   Suspended from the practice of law for six (6) months.
*   Stern warning against future similar offenses.
