## Legal Document Summary: *Asian Center for Career & Employment System & Services, Inc. vs. NLRC and Ibno Mediales* (G.R. No. 131656)

**Key Issue:** Illegal dismissal of an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) and the applicable computation of monetary awards, specifically regarding the unexpired portion of the employment contract under R.A. 8042 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Employment Contract:** Mediales was hired for a two-year term (Feb 28, 1995 - Feb 28, 1997) as a mason in Saudi Arabia with a monthly salary of SR 1,200.
*   **Illegal Dismissal:** ACCESS (petitioner) was found guilty of illegally dismissing Mediales in June 1996 after granting him vacation leave.
*   **R.A. 8042, Sec. 10:** Limits the employer's liability for illegal dismissal to the salary for the unexpired portion of the contract *or* three (3) months for every year of the unexpired term, whichever is *less*.
*   **Attorney's Fees (Art. 2208 of the Civil Code and Art. 111 of the Labor Code):** Awarded due to ACCESS's bad faith in the dismissal, capped at 10% of the total wage award.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court ultimately held ACCESS liable for **SR 3,600**, representing three months' salary (SR 1,200 x 3), consistent with R.A. 8042 Sec. 10.
*   Also liable for attorney's fees of **SR 360** (10% of SR 3,600).

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Applicability of R.A. 8042:** The initial dispute revolved around whether R.A. 8042 applied, given the employment started before its effectivity. The SC correctly held that the date of the illegal dismissal (June 1996), *not* the date of employment, triggers R.A. 8042's application.
*   **Conflict between Dispositive Portion (Fallo) and Body of Decision:** The Labor Arbiter awarded a higher amount (SR 13,200) in the dispositive portion but correctly computed the amount as SR 3,600 in the body. The SC applied the exception to the rule that the fallo controls, holding that the body prevails where the fallo is clearly a mistake unsupported by the decision's reasoning, citing *Olac, vs. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 321, 328 [1992]*.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 8042, Section 10 (Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995):** Crucial statutory basis for limiting the employer's liability for illegal dismissal of OFWs.
*   **Article 2208 of the Civil Code:** Justifies the award of attorney's fees.
*   **Article 111, Chapter III, Title II, Book Three of the Labor Code:** Limits the amount of attorney's fees recoverable to 10% of the wage award.
*   **Erectors, Inc. vs. NLRC, 256 629, 637, [1996]:** (Jurisdiction is determined by the law at the time the cause of action arises)
*   **Olac vs. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 321 [1992]:** Deals with the contradiction between the dispositive portion and the body of a decision.

**Ambiguities and Contested Points:**

*   The primary ambiguity centered on the appropriate computation of the award under R.A. 8042. The NLRC initially erred in not applying it, potentially exposing the employer to a significantly larger liability.
*   The initial award by the Labor Arbiter demonstrates a lack of attention to detail, as the ultimate award was not supported by any argument from the body of the document.
