**Case Summary: *Erlina P. Jolito v. Marlene E. Tanudra & George E. Gareza***

**Citation:** A.M. No. P-08-2469 (Formerly OCA IPI No. 07-2509-P), April 24, 2009

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint

**Facts:**

*   Erlina Jolito (Complainant) engaged Marlene Tanudra (Respondent), a court stenographer, to facilitate the transfer of land titles, providing her PhP20,000 for processing fees.
*   George Gareza (Co-Respondent), a sheriff, introduced Jolito to Tanudra and witnessed the payment.
*   Tanudra failed to process the titles and did not return the money or documents after repeated demands.
*   Tanudra admitted receiving the money (claiming it was PhP19,000) but alleged that the transfer was impossible due to prior foreclosure by the Central Bank and a portion was borrowed by Gareza.
*   The Register of Deeds confirmed no transfer application was ever filed and the vendors in the Deed of Absolute Sale were not the registered owners.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Obligation of Public Servants:** Mandates that court employees must maintain the highest standards of integrity and propriety, even in their private lives. They are prohibited from engaging in private business or vocation that conflicts with their official duties. Cites *Benavidez v. Vega, A.M. No. P-01-1530, December 13, 2001, 372 SCRA 208*
*   **Prohibition of Moonlighting:** Forbids full-time court officers from engaging in private business during office hours to prevent delays in the administration of justice, citing *Biyaheros Mart Livelihood Association, Inc. v. Cabusao, Jr., A.M. No. P-93-811, June 2, 1994, 232 SCRA 707, 713.*

**Liabilities:**

*   **Marlene E. Tanudra:** Found guilty of dishonesty and gross misconduct.
*   **George E. Gareza:** Complaint dismissed due to lack of evidence.

**Penalties:**

*   **Marlene E. Tanudra:** Dismissal from service with prejudice to reinstatement in any government agency and forfeiture of retirement benefits (except for leave credits).

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Civil Service Resolution No. 991936, Section 52 (A) (1) and (3):**  Defines dishonesty and gross misconduct, punishable by dismissal even for the first offense. Cited *Malabanan v. Metrillo, A.M. No. P-04-1875, February 6, 2008, 544 SCRA 1*
*   **Definition of Dishonesty:** "Disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle." Cited *Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation v. Rilloraza, G.R. No. 141141, June 25, 2001, 359 SCRA 525.*
*   **Obligation of Public Servants to Uphold Integrity** Cites *Remolona v. Civil Service Commission, G.R. No. 137473, August 2, 2001, 362 SCRA 304, and Prak v. Anacan, A.M. No. P-03-1738, July 12, 2004, 434 SCRA 11*

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Reliance on Affidavit:** The decision heavily relies on the affidavit of Gareza, despite Tanudraâ€™s claims that he borrowed a portion of the money. While Tanudra's defense was deemed an afterthought due to the lack of timely evidence, the absence of corroborating evidence for Gareza's affidavit could be a point of contention.
*   **"Moonlighting" Definition:**  The decision uses the term "moonlighting" and suggests it inherently conflicts with official duties if performed during office hours. This could be interpreted broadly and create uncertainty for other court employees engaging in legitimate activities outside their core responsibilities.
*   **Lack of Evidence Against Gareza:** While the complaint against Gareza was dismissed, the fact that he introduced Jolito to Tanudra and witnessed the transaction creates a potential for future liability if new evidence surfaces.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Tanudra for dishonesty and gross misconduct due to her engagement in a private transaction outside of her official duties, failing to fulfill her obligations, and attempting to shift blame to a colleague. This case reinforces the high standard of conduct expected of court employees and the severe consequences for breaches of integrity. The potential risks lie in the reliance on affidavit evidence and the broad interpretation of "moonlighting" activities.
