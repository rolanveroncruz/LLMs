**Legal Document Summary: *Abelardo P. Abel v. Philex Mining Corporation***

**Case:** G.R. No. 178976, July 31, 2009 (612 Phil. 203)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision upholding NLRC's finding of legal dismissal.

**Key Issue:** Validity of Abelardo Abel's dismissal by Philex Mining Corporation (PMC).

**Ruling:** CA decision reversed. Abel's dismissal declared *illegal*.

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Grounds for Dismissal (PMC's Claim):** Fraud/loss of trust and confidence (Art. 282(c), Labor Code) and gross and habitual neglect of duty (Art. 282(b), Labor Code).
*   **Loss of Trust & Confidence:** While Abel's position (Contract Claims Assistant) was deemed to involve a degree of trust (monitoring contractors), PMC's evidence of a "willful breach of trust" was insufficient. The court found witness testimony (Lupega's affidavit about phone calls) to be unsubstantiated and insufficient to prove Abel's involvement in fraud or extortion.  The court pointed to the lack of corroborating evidence.
*   **Gross & Habitual Neglect:** PMC argued Abel failed to act on Lupega's report of underloading by ANSECA trucks. The Court disagreed, finding that referral to Tabogader (Subsidence Area Head) wasn't gross negligence and Tabogader's subsequent assurance negated habitual neglect. *Union Motor Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 159738, December 9, 2004, 445 SCRA 683, 694.* was cited to establish that single or isolated act of negligence does not constitute a just cause for dismissal of employee.
*   **Procedural Due Process:** PMC failed to provide adequate notice to Abel.  The initial "Notice to Explain" lacked a clear indication of potential dismissal or specification of the grounds under Art. 282 (i.e., loss of trust or neglect). Citing *King of Kings Transport v. Mamac, G.R. No. 166208, June 29, 2007, 526 SCRA 116, 125-126*, the Court reiterated the twin notice requirement.

**Obligations/Liabilities (PMC):**

*   **Reinstatement:** Ordered to reinstate Abel to his former or equivalent position.
*   **Backwages:** Ordered to pay full backwages (including allowances and benefits) from dismissal until reinstatement.
*   **Separation Pay (Alternative):** If reinstatement is not feasible due to strained relations, separation pay equal to one month's salary for every year of service from hiring to finality of the decision is required in addition to backwages.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Strained Relations" Exception:** The determination of whether "strained relations" exist, precluding reinstatement, could be contentious and subject to interpretation.
*   **Valuation of Backwages & Benefits:** Calculation of backwages, including all allowances and benefits, may lead to disputes regarding specific benefits and their monetary equivalents.
*   **Good Faith/Fair Dealing:** While Abel was ordered reinstatement, the court noted, "Petitioner, although not entirely faultless, was dismissed without just cause and procedural due process."

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Art. 282(b) & (c):** Just causes for termination: gross/habitual neglect; fraud/loss of trust.
*   ***Community Rural Bank of San Isidro (N.E.), Inc. v. Paez, G.R. No. 158707, November 27, 2006, 508 SCRA 245, 257-258.**: defines the meaning of substantial evidence.
