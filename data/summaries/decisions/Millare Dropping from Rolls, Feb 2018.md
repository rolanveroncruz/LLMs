**Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. 17-11-131-MeTC, Re: Dropping from the Rolls of Janice C. Millare**

**Nature:** Administrative Matter; Dropping from the Rolls (AWOL)

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Dropping from the Rolls:** Ms. Janice C. Millare, Clerk III, is dropped from the rolls effective July 17, 2017, due to absence without official leave (AWOL) for more than 30 working days.
*   **Legal Basis:** Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Rules on Leave, as amended by Civil Service Commission (CSC) Memorandum Circular No. 13, Series of 2007. This provision mandates separation from service for continuous AWOL of 30+ days.
*   **Obligation to Report:** Implicit duty of a court personnel to report for work and fulfill duties.  Failure is considered neglect of duty and disregard for standards of public accountability.
*   **Position Vacant:** Millare's position is declared vacant.
*   **Benefits & Reemployment:** She remains qualified for benefits under existing laws and is eligible for future government reemployment.
*  **Notification** Millare is to be notified of separation from service and is in accordance with the provisions of Section 63, Rule XVI of the Omnibus Civil Service Rules and Regulations.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Administrative Liability:**  AWOL constitutes a violation of public service obligations (responsibility, integrity, loyalty, efficiency)
*   **Potential Disqualification (Case Specific):** While eligible for reemployment *generally*, specific future disqualification would hinge on facts and subsequent government rules. This document does not bar her from future employment, provided that the circumstances related to her AWOL are reviewed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Service of Notice:** Ensuring proper service of the Resolution at Millare's last known address is critical to avoid procedural challenges. Lack of proper service could give rise to future legal challenges.
*   **Reason for AWOL:** The document doesn't investigate or consider the reason for Millare's AWOL. While not explicitly required, this could be a basis for later challenge, though the Rule appears absolute.
* **Case law:** Re: Dropping from the Rolls of Rowie A. Quimno, A.M. No. 17-03-33-MCTC, April 17, 2017 and Re: AWOL of Ms. Fernandita B. Borja, 549 Phil. 533, 536 (2007).
