## Legal Document Summary: Associated Bank vs. Pronstroller

**Case:** *Associated Bank (now United Overseas Bank [Phils.]) vs. Spouses Rafael and Monaliza Pronstroller* (G.R. No. 148444, July 14, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the CA's affirmation of the RTC decision for Specific Performance.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Real Estate Mortgage & Foreclosure:** Spouses Vaca mortgaged property to Associated Bank, defaulted, and the property was foreclosed with Associated Bank as the highest bidder.
*   **Litigation with Vaca:** Spouses Vaca initiated action to nullify the REM and foreclosure. Associated Bank filed for a writ of possession, initially denied then granted by CA.
*   **Sale Negotiations with Pronstroller:** Pending the Vaca case, Associated Bank offered the property for sale. Spouses Pronstroller offered P7.5 million, accepted by Associated Bank (through Atty. Soluta).
*   **Initial Agreement (March 18, 1993):** Letter-Agreement stipulating P7.5M purchase price, 10% down payment, balance in escrow within 90 days pending delivery of property free of occupants.
*   **Modified Agreement (July 14, 1993):** Letter-Agreement (signed by Atty. Soluta) allowing balance payment upon final Supreme Court order in the Vaca case *and/or* delivery of property free from occupants.
*   **Internal Bank Reorganization & Rescission Attempt:** New management (Atty. Dayday) deemed Pronstrollers in breach for not depositing balance in escrow within the original 90-day period; ARRMC disapproved extension request and sought rescission. Bank formally notified Pronstrollers of rescission and forfeiture of deposit.
*   **Pronstroller's New Offer:** Spouses Pronstroller offered a new payment scheme, which was rejected by the Bank unless a 24.5% interest was paid on unpaid balance. They were offered a refund of their deposit if they did not agree.
*   **Vaca Case Resolved:** The Supreme Court upheld Associated Bank's right to possess the property (July 14, 1994).
*   **Specific Performance Suit:** Pronstrollers filed suit for specific performance based on the July 14 agreement. Lis Pendens registered.
*   **Sale to Vaca:** During litigation, Associated Bank sold the property back to the Spouses Vaca. TCT was issued to the Vacas.
*   **RTC Decision:** Ruled for Pronstrollers. Rescission deemed void. Ordered Associated Bank to accept balance payment, deliver title/possession, and pay damages. RTC applied the doctrine of apparent authority.
*   **CA Decision:** Affirmed RTC. Upheld Atty. Soluta's authority based on apparent authority and estoppel. Ordered Associated Bank to execute Deed of Absolute Sale to Pronstrollers and Register of Deeds to cancel Vaca's TCT.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed CA decision citing the doctrine of apparent authority, estoppel against the bank, and the lack of valid rescission.

**Key Legal Issues & Potential Risks:**

*   **Apparent Authority:** Whether Atty. Soluta had the apparent authority to bind Associated Bank through the July 14 agreement. The Court focuses on the bank's prior acquiescence in Soluta's actions, even without explicit board resolutions. Cites *Inter-Asia Investments Ind., Inc. v. Court of Appeals* and *First Philippine International Bank v. CA*. **Risk:** Future actions by corporate officers outside of formal authority may bind the corporation if it has previously held them out as having such authority.
*   **Validity of Rescission:** Whether the bank validly rescinded the agreement. The Court held no breach occurred since the payment deadline was modified by the July 14 agreement. **Risk:** Unilateral rescission clauses may not be enforceable if subsequent agreements modify the original terms.
*   **Estoppel:**
    *   **Pronstroller's Estoppel:** Whether Pronstrollers were estopped from enforcing the July 14 agreement due to their subsequent "new" offer. The Court held the "new" offer was merely demonstrative of their financial capacity and did not constitute abandonment of the prior contract.
    *   **Associated Bank's Estoppel:** Whether Associated Bank was estopped from questioning the July 14 agreement due to their failure to repudiate it promptly. The Court affirmed the estoppel.
*   **Lis Pendens:** Effect of the Notice of Lis Pendens on the subsequent sale to the Vacas. Court emphasized the purpose of lis pendens to bind subsequent purchasers.
*   **Collateral Attack:** Whether the order to cancel the TCT issued to the Vacas constitutes a collateral attack on title, prohibited by Section 48 of P.D. 1529. The Court held that the cancellation, due to the prior Lis Pendens, does not constitute a prohibited collateral attack. Cites *Romero v. Court of Appeals* and *Spouses Lim v. Vera Cruz*.
*   **Damages:** Award of moral damages and attorney's fees. Based on Associated Bank's fraudulent and bad faith conduct (Article 2220 of the Civil Code).

**Contentious/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   The "and/or" phrasing in the July 14 agreement regarding the conditions for payment. This gave Pronstrollers flexibility in fulfilling their obligation.
*   Atty. Soluta's actual authority, or lack thereof, which became the central point of contention.

**Statutory References:**

*   Section 48 of P.D. 1529 (Prohibition of Collateral Attack on Titles)
*   Article 2220 of the New Civil Code (Moral Damages for Breach of Contract)

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court sided with the Pronstrollers, emphasizing good faith dealings in commercial transactions. This case highlights the importance of clear delegations of authority within corporations, the potential risks associated with the doctrine of apparent authority, and the binding effect of a notice of lis pendens. Associated Bank's attempt to circumvent its agreements through internal reorganization and subsequent sale to the Vacas resulted in a finding of bad faith and an award of damages.
