## Legal Document Summary: Segovia v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 124067 (1998)

**Nature of Document:** Decision of the Supreme Court resolving a special civil action of certiorari and prohibition challenging the Sandiganbayan's resolutions ordering the preventive suspension of petitioners Perla Segovia, Reynaldo Santiago, and Winifredo SM. Pangilinan, NPC employees, in Criminal Case No. 21711 for violation of R.A. 3019 (Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act), specifically Section 3(e).

**Key Provisions & Issues:**
*   **Section 13 of RA 3019 (Preventive Suspension):** The core issue is whether the Sandiganbayan has *mandatory* or *discretionary* authority to suspend public officers accused under a valid information of violating R.A. 3019, Title 7, Book II of the Revised Penal Code, or offenses involving fraud upon government funds/property.
*   **Factual Background:** Petitioners, as members of the NPC's Contracts Committee, disqualified the lowest bidder (Joint Venture) for a project. A complaint was filed alleging that the committee favored Joint Venture and then improperly cancelled the project after a protest by the second lowest bidder (Urban).
*   **Argument Against Suspension:** Petitioners argued that the Sandiganbayan abused its discretion, contending that the suspension was not mandatory, no unwarranted benefit/injury resulted, they were not compensated for their ad hoc committee roles, their current positions lacked involvement with contract bidding, and they posed no risk of tampering with evidence.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the petition, upholding the Sandiganbayan's resolutions. The Court affirmed the *mandatory* nature of preventive suspension under Section 13 of R.A. 3019 after the validity of the information is determined.

**Key Obligations & Liabilities:**
*   **Duty of the Court:** Upon filing of a valid information under R.A. 3019, the court *must* place the accused public officer under preventive suspension.
*   **Pre-Suspension Hearing:** The court *must* conduct a pre-suspension hearing to determine the validity of the information (e.g., due preliminary investigation, sufficiency of the acts charged, grounds for quashal under Rule 117 of the Rules of Court).
*   **Maximum Suspension:** Preventive suspension cannot exceed 90 days (P.D. 807, Sec. 52 of the Administrative Code of 1987).
*   **Liability:** Accused public officers are subject to mandatory suspension upon valid information.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**
*   **R.A. 3019, Section 3(e) and Section 13:** Core statutory basis for the charge and the mandatory suspension.
*   **Revised Penal Code, Title 7, Book II:** Referenced within Section 13 regarding offenses triggering suspension.
*   **P.D. 807 and Administrative Code of 1987, Sec. 52:** Limit on the duration of preventive suspension.
*   **Numerous Supreme Court precedents cited:** *Bayot v. Sandiganbayan*, *Bolastig v. Sandiganbayan*, *Gonzaga v. Sandiganbayan*, *Luciano v. Mariano*, *Socrates v. Sandiganbayan*, *Libanan v. Sandiganbayan* affirming the mandatory nature of Section 13.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**
*   **Abuse of Power:** While seemingly mandatory, ensuring a fair and thorough pre-suspension hearing is critical to prevent abuse of power and unwarranted suspension.
*   **Impact on Public Service:** The Court acknowledges the potential for disruption of public service, but consistently prioritizes the prevention of potential abuse of office and obstruction of justice.
*   **Interpretation of "Validity of Information":** Subjective interpretation of "validity" could lead to inconsistency and legal challenges.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court has firmly established the mandatory nature of preventive suspension under Section 13 of RA 3019, as the court has the duty to suspend an accused official upon the filing of a valid information. The court leaves no room for discretion. The court conducts the pre-suspension hearing only to determine the validity of the information and nothing more.
