**Legal Document Summary: *Valderama v. Arguelles***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 223660, April 02, 2018 (829 Phil. 29)

**Nature:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the CA decision which dismissed Petitioner's appeal. This appeal concerned the RTC's order to cancel a Notice of Adverse Claim (NAC) annotated on a land title, TCT No. 266311.

**Key Issue:** Whether the subsequent annotation of a Notice of Lis Pendens (NLP) on a Certificate of Title renders a prior Adverse Claim on the same title moot and academic, justifying the cancellation of the Adverse Claim.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the RTC Resolutions, and dismissed the petition for cancellation of the Adverse Claim. The Court held that a subsequent Notice of Lis Pendens does NOT automatically render a prior Adverse Claim moot. *Villaflor v. Juezan* (263 Phil. 224 (1990)) is distinguished as the termination of the related civil case was a material factor in considering the petition for cancellation of adverse claim moot and academic. *Ty Sin Tei v. Dy Piao* (103 Phil. 858 (1958)) is applicable as the court held that an adverse claim may be cancelled only after it is adjudged invalid or unmeritorious by the Court.

**Key Provisions and Concepts:**

*   **Adverse Claim (Sec. 70, P.D. 1529):** Protects the right of a claimant during the pendency of a controversy over land. It serves as a warning to third parties.
*   **Notice of Lis Pendens (Sec. 76, P.D. 1529):** Protects the right of the claimant during the pendency of the action or litigation. It's a notice that litigation is pending that affects the land.
*   **Cancellation of Adverse Claim (Sec. 70, P.D. 1529):** Requires a petition to the court and a hearing to determine the validity of the claim. It is only when such claim is found unmeritorious that the registration of the adverse claim may be cancelled.
*   **Cancellation of Lis Pendens (Sec. 77, P.D. 1529):** May be ordered by the Court having jurisdiction of the case.
*   **Distinction between Adverse Claim and Lis Pendens:** The Court emphasizes that the two are distinct remedies serving different purposes. A Lis Pendens is a mere incident of an action. Unlike adverse claim, it can be cancelled without a court hearing.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Respondents (Sonia and Lorna Arguelles):** Filed the petition to cancel the Adverse Claim and lost on appeal. Had a pending action for recovery of ownership and physical possession (Civil Case No. 13130761).
*   **Petitioner (Lourdes Valderama):** Opposed the cancellation of the Adverse Claim, claiming rights as an heir of the original owner (Conchita).
*   **Duty of the Court:** Under Sec. 70 or P.D. 1529, the court is mandated to conduct a speedy hearing to determine the validity of the adverse claim upon a party's petition.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Validity of the Deed of Sale:** The validity of the deed of sale from Conchita to the Respondents remains unresolved and is the central issue in Civil Case No. 13130761.
*   **Heir's Rights:** The Petitioner's rights as an heir of Conchita are dependent on the outcome of the determination of the validity of the Deed of Sale.
*   **Conflicting Decisions:** While this case clarifies that Lis Pendens does not automatically cancel Adverse Claims, the risk of conflicting decisions remains if the Civil Case and the Adverse Claim petition are resolved differently.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   ***Villaflor v. Juezan*** (263 Phil. 224 (1990)): Distinguished. Addressed the issue of cancelling adverse claim but involved a related case that had already reached finality.
*   ***Ty Sin Tei v. Dy Piao*** (103 Phil. 858 (1958)): Applied. Held that the institution of an action and annotation of lis pendens do not invalidate a prior adverse claim, where both refer to the same right or interest.
*   ***Sajonas vs. CA*** (327 Phil. 689, 710 (1996)): Discussed the effects of cancellation of an adverse claim.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree):** Sections 70, 76, and 77 are central to the issues.
*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Petition for Review on Certiorari to the Supreme Court
*   **Act 496:** Land Registration Act

**Conclusion:** This case clarifies that an Adverse Claim and Lis Pendens are not mutually exclusive remedies. The filing of a Lis Pendens does not automatically warrant the cancellation of a prior Adverse Claim. The validity of the Adverse Claim must still be determined by the court as mandated by Section 70 of PD 1529.
