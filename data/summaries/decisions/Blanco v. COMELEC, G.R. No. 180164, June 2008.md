## Legal Document Summary: Blanco v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 180164

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision on Petition for Certiorari (Rule 64)

**Core Issue:** Whether COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in disqualifying Petitioner Florentino Blanco from running for elective office in the 2007 elections, based on a previous disqualification (G.R. No. 122258) and COMELEC Resolution in SPA No. 01-050.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** Blanco argued that his previous disqualification in G.R. No. 122258 (vote-buying) was administrative under Sec. 68 of the Omnibus Election Code and only applied to the 1995 elections, not a permanent bar. He also argued the disqualification under Sec. 40(b) of the Local Government Code for removal from office doesn't apply because his proclamation was suspended, meaning he was never "removed" from an actual term of office.

*   **COMELEC's Position:** COMELEC maintained that the previous rulings permanently disqualified Blanco absent executive clemency.

*   **Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the petition, declared the COMELEC resolution NULL and SET ASIDE, and held Blanco eligible to run for office.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **COMELEC's Obligation:** The COMELEC has the obligation to ensure fair and legal elections. However, it cannot exceed its jurisdiction by imposing disqualifications not based on criminal convictions or removals from office.
* No liabilities are in place here.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Criminal Conviction:** The core issue is the lack of a criminal conviction for vote-buying that would trigger permanent disqualification under the Omnibus Election Code. The previous disqualification was based on an administrative finding under Sec. 68, which the Court clarifies is election specific (limited to the 1995 election in this case).

*   **Misapplication of Sec. 40(b), LGC:** The Court found that COMELEC misapplied the disqualification under Sec. 40(b) of the Local Government Code (removal from office), as Blanco was never actually removed from office. He was disqualified from assuming office.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code:** Sec. 68 (Disqualifications), Sec. 261(a) (Vote-buying), Sec. 264 (Penalties for Election Offenses), Sec. 265 (Prosecution of offenses by COMELEC), Sec. 268 (Jurisdiction of Courts)
*   **Local Government Code:** Sec. 40(b) (Disqualifications for removal from office)
*   **Blanco v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 122258):** Interpreted as administratively disqualifying Blanco for the 1995 election only.
*   **Codilla v. De Venecia (G.R. No. 150605):** Clarifies COMELEC's limited jurisdiction to disqualify candidates.
*   **Lanot v. COMELEC (G.R. No. 164858):** Further clarifies that disqualifications are subject to either a full-blown hearing or a clear preponderance of evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:** None found.

**Potential Issues:**

*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** The court notes the absence of a motion for reconsideration before the COMELEC en banc before directly seeking certiorari. However, it waived this requirement because the COMELEC resolution was a nullity.
