**Legal Document Summary: WT Construction, Inc. vs. Hon. Ulric R. Ca√±ete and the Estate of Alberto Cabahug (G.R. No. 157287)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review of a Court of Appeals Decision upholding a Regional Trial Court (RTC) Order directing WT Construction, Inc. (WT) to pay the balance of a land sale to the Estate of Alberto Cabahug.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Agreement for Sale of Land with Downpayment:** WT agreed to purchase land from the Estate. 50% down payment made. Balance due upon clearing of occupants/obstructions.
*   **Clearing Obligation:** The contract stipulated that seller shall be the one clearing the land of any occupants and/or ejecting the squatters with in a period of one (1) year reckoned from the receipt of the advance payment, provided however, that if the buyer will be the one to handle the clearing or ejectment of occupants, all the expenses incurred thereto shall be charged to and be deducted from the remaining balance payable.
*   **RTC Order:** The RTC initially ordered WT to pay the balance, less ejectment expenses. The CA has sustained the order by the trial court.
*   **Writ of Execution:** Issued to enforce the RTC Order. WT argues it is premature and defective.

**Obligations:**

*   **WT Construction:** Obligated to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price (P4,259,400.00), subject to deduction for ejectment expenses.
*   **Estate of Alberto Cabahug:** Originally obligated to clear the land. Now seemingly transferring this obligation to WT, with corresponding deductions from the balance.

**Liabilities:**

*   **WT Construction:** Liable for the balance of the purchase price. Potential liability for further costs if the Quieting of Title action succeeds.
*   **Estate of Alberto Cabahug:** Potentially liable to third parties (claimants in Quieting of Title action) if their claim is successful, possibly affecting the net proceeds from the sale.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Quieting of Title Action:** Pending action could significantly reduce the land area and value, potentially impacting the equity and purchase price.
*   **Ambiguous Clearing Obligation:** The contract is unclear on the exact method of calculating and documenting "ejectment expenses," potentially leading to disputes.
*   **Probate Court Jurisdiction:** WT challenges the probate court's jurisdiction to adjudicate contract disputes. While the Supreme Court found this argument waived and within the court's incidental powers, it raises a potential challenge on jurisdictional grounds.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Section 8(e) of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** WT alleges the writ of execution improperly delegates authority to the sheriff to determine the amount levied. The Court disagrees.
*   **Rules 88, 90, and 142 of the Revised Rules of Court:** WT argued the writ was not authorized under these rules governing probate courts. The Supreme Court disagreed, affirming the probate court's authority to enforce the sale necessary for settling the estate (implied power).
*   **Relevant Doctrines on Contract Interpretation:** WT invokes the doctrine that contracts are the law between parties. However, the Court enforced the contract as written.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Expenses incurred in the ejectment case":** The mechanism for calculating these expenses, specifically how they are proven and verified, is not defined.
*   **Condition Precedent of Clearing Occupants:** While technically part of the contract the court does not address who is responsible for clearing the occupants, therefore there is not a clear answer on whether the payment is contingent on complete eviction.

**Concise Legal Assessment:**

WT is attempting to avoid its contractual obligation. The Supreme Court rejects all arguments, finding that the writ of execution is valid, the probate court acted within its jurisdiction, and the existence of a pending Quieting of Title action does not excuse WT from paying the balance. The primary remaining legal risk pertains to the outcome of the Quieting of Title action, as that may impact the value of the property, although WT's obligation to pay is already established. The ambiguity surrounding ejectment expenses could lead to future disputes, but WT's failure to present adequate proof in the probate court weakened its position.
