**Case:** *Esqueda v. People*, G.R. No. 170222 (2009)

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reviewed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision affirming the trial court's conviction of Edgar Esqueda for frustrated homicide.  The SC reversed the CA and convicted Esqueda of *frustrated murder*. The case stems from a stabbing incident where Esqueda and an unidentified accomplice attacked Venancia Aliser and Gaudencio Quiniquito. The Trial Court acquitted Esqueda of the charge for the stabbing of Gaudencio and convicted him of Frustrated Homicide for stabbing Venancia Aliser. 

**Key Provisions/Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Originally charged with two counts of Frustrated Murder (Art. 248, in relation to Arts. 6 & 5, Revised Penal Code (RPC)).
*   **Trial Court Decision:** Acquitted on one count (Quiniquito stabbing), convicted of Frustrated Homicide (Aliser stabbing), sentencing Esqueda to 2 years, 6 months, and 20 days of *prision correccional* (minimum) to 8 years, 4 months, and 10 days of *prision mayor* (medium). No damages awarded due to lack of evidence.
*   **Court of Appeals Decision:** Affirmed the trial court's decision.
*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Reversed the CA; convicted Esqueda of Frustrated Murder.
*   **Positive Identification:** Victim (Venancia Aliser) and Gaudencio Quiniquito positively identified Esqueda.
*   **Rejection of Alibi/Denial:** Defense of alibi (fishing at sea) and denial were deemed weak and unreliable.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** The SC found the presence of treachery, qualifying the crime to murder. The sudden and unexpected attack on Venancia, depriving her of the opportunity to defend herself after the accomplice stabbed Quiniquito, constitutes treachery. This was not raised on appeal but was considered by the SC.
*   **Intent to Kill:** Proven by the nature of the weapon (knife), the number and nature of the wounds, and the manner of attack (continuing to stab Venancia after she fell).
*   **Frustration:** The wounds inflicted were potentially fatal, but Venancia survived due to timely medical intervention.
*   **Penalty:** Indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* (medium) to 14 years, 8 months, and 1 day of *reclusion temporal* (medium).
*   **Damages Awarded:**
    *   Temperate damages: P25,000.00 (in lieu of actual damages for hospitalization).
    *   Moral damages: P40,000.00.
    *   Exemplary damages: P30,000.00 (due to the presence of treachery).
    *   Attorney's fees: P10,000.00.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Supreme Court's *motu proprio* reclassification:** The SC *motu proprio* (on its own motion) reclassified the crime to frustrated murder, even though it wasn't the main issue raised on appeal, potentially impacting due process considerations if the defense was not sufficiently prepared to rebut the treachery allegation. However, the Court notes that an appeal opens the entire case for review on questions not raised by the parties.
*   **Circumstantial Evidence of Conspiracy:** Although Esqueda was acquitted of the crime against Gaudencio due to lack of evidence of conspiracy, the evidence of the coordinated attack between Esqueda and the unidentified assailant could be scrutinized further to determine if a conspiracy existed.
* **Lack of medical records and evidence:** The award of temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00 in lieu of actual damages was rendered due to the absence of medical records and evidence.
