**Case:** *Estrada v. Office of the Ombudsman* (G.R. Nos. 212761-62, 213473-74, 213538-39)

**Summary:**

Senator Jinggoy Estrada, John Raymund de Asis, and Janet Lim Napoles filed consolidated petitions for certiorari assailing the Office of the Ombudsman's Joint Resolution and Joint Order finding probable cause to indict them for Plunder (RA 7080) and violations of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 in connection with the PDAF scam. The Supreme Court upheld the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause, dismissing the petitions.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **RA 7080 (Plunder):**  Defines Plunder as a public officer who, by themselves or with others, amasses ill-gotten wealth exceeding P50,000,000 through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts.
*   **RA 3019, Sec 3(e):**  Prohibits public officers from causing undue injury to the government or giving unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Estrada: Allegedly authorized the illegal use of his PDAF, received kickbacks (P183,793,750.00), and gave unwarranted benefits to Napoles' NGOs.
*   Napoles: Allegedly mastermind the PDAF scam, facilitated the illegal use of Estrada's PDAF, and operated JLN-controlled NGOs as conduits.
*   De Asis: Allegedly assisted in processing and releasing PDAF funds to JLN-controlled NGOs as an officer in one of the NGO.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Criminal prosecution for Plunder and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
*   Forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7080:** Anti-Plunder Law.
*   **Republic Act No. 3019:** Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
*   **Cambe v. Office of the Ombudsman (G.R. Nos. 212014-15, 6 December 2016):** Upheld the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against another Senator in a similar PDAF scam.
*   **Reyes v. Ombudsman (783 Phil. 304):** Upheld Ombudsman's finding of probable cause in PDAF scam.
*   **De Lima v. Reyes (776 Phil. 623):**  Preliminary investigation rendered moot when the court obtains jurisdiction upon filing of criminal information and warrants of arrest.
*   **Estrada v. Office of the Ombudsman (751 Phil. 821):** Hearsay evidence allowed to determine probable cause in preliminary investigation
*   **Belgica v. Ochoa:**  Congressional Pork Barrel allows legislators to participate in the post-enactment phases of project implementation.
*   **Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 112:**  Procedure for preliminary investigation.
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence Rule 130, Section 28:** Res inter alios acta -  the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   Application of *res inter alios acta* during preliminary investigation.  The court held that this rule does not rigidly apply during preliminary investigations.
*   Weight and admissibility of whistleblower testimonies, Luy's ledgers, COA reports, and field verifications as evidence of conspiracy and ill-gotten wealth. Court used these as key pieces of evidence for probable cause.
*   The exact nature of De Asis' actions and their degree of involvement in the fraudulent scheme is contested.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The Court reaffirms the Ombudsman's broad discretion in determining probable cause.
*   Preliminary investigations do not require strict adherence to rules of evidence.
*   Filing of the Information and issuance of a warrant of arrest by the Sandiganbayan renders moot any challenge to the preliminary investigation before the SC.

**Note:**  Velasco, Jr., J., dissented regarding Estrada, arguing insufficient admissible evidence to establish probable cause. Peralta, J., concurred in result but took a different view on the grounds for dismissing the petitions and questioned Estrada's separate charges for violations of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.
