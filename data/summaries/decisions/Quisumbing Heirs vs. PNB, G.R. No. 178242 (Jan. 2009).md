**Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Norberto J. Quisumbing vs. Philippine National Bank and Santiago Land Development Corporation***

**Case Citation:** 596 Phil. 831 (G.R. No. 178242, January 20, 2009)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision denying Petition for Review on Certiorari. Affirms Court of Appeals' denial of petitioners' appeal, which in turn affirmed the RTC's dismissal of petitioners' complaint against PNB and SLDC to compel redemption of foreclosed properties.

**Key Provisions/Issues:**

*   **Validity of Tender of Redemption:** The central issue is whether Quisumbing, as assignee of the mortgagors' rights, made a valid tender of redemption of foreclosed properties from PNB. The SC affirmed that he did not.
*   **Section 25, P.D. No. 694 (Revised Charter of PNB):**  This section governs the redemption of properties foreclosed by PNB. It requires payment of *all* claims of the bank against the mortgagor, including costs and accrued interests.
*   **Act No. 3135 (Extra-Judicial Foreclosure Law):** Petitioners argued that this law, along with Rule 39, Sec. 30 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, should govern, requiring a lower redemption price (amount of purchase, interest, taxes).
*   **"Judicial Redemption" Exception:** Petitioners claimed their filing of a complaint constituted a "judicial redemption," which would excuse simultaneous tender of payment, citing *Tioseco v. CA*. The SC rejected this argument, as it found bad faith in the filing of the complaint, it was not for the sole purpose of determining the redemption price but also to challenge the constitutionality of Sec. 25, P.D. No. 694.
*   **Constitutionality of Section 25, P.D. No. 694:** Petitioners argued that Section 25 is unconstitutional (due process, equal protection), particularly after PNB's privatization. The SC deemed this issue moot due to the privatization of PNB and the repeal of P.D. No. 694 by E.O. 80.
*   **Status of Spouses Silverio:** Whether they were considered accommodation mortgagors or direct debtors is a question of fact that the SC deems moot.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Mortgagor/Assignee (Quisumbing/Heirs):** Obligation to make a valid tender of redemption, meaning a simultaneous offer of full payment as determined by the applicable statute. Failure to do so forfeits the right of redemption, as stated in Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank, Inc., v. Court of Appeals. Liable for costs.
*   **PNB:** Initially had an obligation to calculate and inform Quisumbing of the redemption price as governed by Sec. 25, P.D. No. 694.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Good Faith Requirement:** The application of the "judicial redemption" exception hinges on a finding of good faith, requiring the action to be filed *solely* to determine the redemption price.  The dual purpose in this case (determining price AND challenging constitutionality) was fatal.
*   **Vagueness Argument:** The petitioners argued that Section 25 of P.D. No. 694 should be voided for vagueness. Although the court did not address it due to its mootness, this could be re-litigated if similar cases arise.
*   **Res Judicata (SLDC Argument):** SLDC argued that *Komatsu Industries (Phils.) Inc. v. Philippine National Bank and Santiago Land Development Corporation* (G.R. No. 127682) barred the action concerning the Pasong Tamo property. Although the SC didn't explicitly rule on res judicata, it implied its inapplicability by addressing the core issue of tender.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 25, P.D. No. 694:** Revised Charter of the Philippine National Bank
*   **Act No. 3135:** Extra-Judicial Foreclosure Law (as amended)
*   **Rule 39, Section 30, Rules of Civil Procedure (formerly Section 28, Code of Civil Procedure):** Redemption amounts.
*   **E.O. 80:** Repealed Presidential Decree No. 694
*   **Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank, Inc., v. Court of Appeals:** Requirements for valid redemption by banks.
*   **BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc. vs. Veloso** Requirements for tender of payment
*   **Tioseco v. CA:** Judicial redemption as exception to simultaneous tender rule (distinguished).
*   **Tolentino v. Court of Appeals:** Requirements for judicial redemption
*   **Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:** The conditions of timely redemption, good faith, redemption price, and prompt payment for judicial redemption.

**Conclusion:**

The SC denied the petition, finding no valid tender of redemption because there was no simultaneous offer of full payment. The SC ruled that the exception of judicial redemption was inapplicable. The case highlights the importance of strict compliance with redemption requirements, especially where specific statutes like P.D. No. 694 were involved (before its repeal), and demonstrates the challenges in successfully arguing a judicial redemption where motives extend beyond simply determining the redemption price.
