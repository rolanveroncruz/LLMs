Okay, here's a summary of the provided document, focusing on key legal points:

**Case:** *China Banking Corporation v. Judge Leoncio M. Janolo, Jr.*, A.M. No. RTJ-07-2035

**Nature:** Administrative Complaint against a Regional Trial Court Judge

**Complainant:** China Banking Corporation (China Bank)

**Respondent:** Judge Leoncio M. Janolo, Jr., RTC, Br. 264, Pasig City

**Summary:**

China Bank filed an administrative complaint against Judge Janolo, Jr. alleging simple misconduct and undue delay in rendering orders concerning Civil Case No. 68105 (filed by Solid Builders, Inc. and Medina Food Industries, Inc. against China Bank). Specifically, the complaint stemmed from delays in resolving China Bank's Motion for Reconsideration (of the preliminary injunction order) and Motion to Dissolve (the preliminary injunction).

**Key Provisions & Violations:**

*   **Undue Delay in Rendering Orders:** Judge Janolo, Jr. violated:
    *   **Section 4, Rule 37 of the Rules of Court:** Requiring motions for reconsideration to be resolved within 30 days. The judge took longer than 30 days to resolve the motion.
    *   **Section 15(1), Article VIII of the Constitution:** Mandating resolution of matters within 3 months from submission. The Judge took longer than 3 months to resolve the motion.
    *   **Section 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary:** requiring all judicial duties be performed efficiently and with reasonable promptness.
*   **Simple Misconduct:** Failure to act on Civil Case No. 68105 for a considerable length of time after China Bank filed its reply. This shows a lack of dedication to work. *Jacinto v. Layosa* defines simple misconduct as a transgression of established rules.

**OCA Findings & Recommendations:**

The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) initially found Judge Janolo, Jr. guilty of undue delay and recommended a fine of P15,000.

**Court's Ruling:**

The Supreme Court found Judge Janolo, Jr. guilty of BOTH simple misconduct AND undue delay. The Court rejected the P15,000 fine as too lenient, citing Judge Janolo Jr.'s history of similar offenses ( *Office of the Court Administrator v. Janolo, Jr.*, *Gil v. Judge Janolo, Jr.*). The Court imposed a fine of P20,000 and sternly warned against repetition.

**Relevant Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Constitution, Art. VIII, Sec. 15(1) & (2):** Timelines for resolving matters.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 37, Sec. 4:** Timeline for resolving Motion for Reconsideration.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140, Sec. 9 & 11(B):** Classification and penalties for undue delay and simple misconduct.
*   **New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, Sec. 5, Canon 6**
*   **Office of the Court Administrator v. Laron, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1870** Failure to act on a case for a considerable length of time demonstrates lack of dedication to one's work and is administratively sanctionable.
*   **Jacinto v. Layosa, A.M. No. RTJ-02-1743** Simple misconduct is a transgression of some established rule of action, an unlawful behavior, or negligence committed by a public officer.
*   ***Santos v. Lacurom,* A.M. No. RTJ-04-1823** The issue of voluntary inhibition is primarily a matter of conscience and sound discretion on the part of the judge.
*    **Atty. Villanueva-Fabella v. Judge Lee, 464 Phil. 548** A certification of non-forum shopping is not needed in the institution of administrative proceedings against judges

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Judge's Discretionary Inhibition:** China Bank requested Judge Janolo, Jr.'s inhibition from the Civil Case No. 68105 and another case. The Court affirmed that inhibition is discretionary, reminding the Judge to be impartial. *Santos v. Lacurom* is cited.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Judge Janolo, Jr.'s prior offenses led to a higher penalty. The reference to prior cases ( *Office of the Court Administrator v. Janolo, Jr.* and *Gil v. Judge Janolo, Jr.* ) is crucial for understanding the severity of the sanction.

**Key Takeaways:**

The case underscores the importance of judicial efficiency and adherence to timelines. It also clarifies that administrative complaints against judges do not require a certificate of non-forum shopping.  The repeated nature of the offenses significantly impacted the severity of the penalty.
