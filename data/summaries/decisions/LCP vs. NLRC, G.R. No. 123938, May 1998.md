**Legal Document Summary: Labor Congress of the Philippines (LCP) vs. National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and Empire Food Products**

**Case:** G.R. No. 123938, May 21, 1998 (352 Phil. 1118)

**Nature:** Special Civil Action for Certiorari under Rule 65, challenging the NLRC's affirmation of the Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal, ULP, and wage violations filed by LCP on behalf of 99 employees against Empire Food Products.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Memorandum of Agreement (MOA):** Signed on October 23, 1990, between LCP and Empire Food Products. Recognizes LCP as the sole bargaining agent. Issues in NLRC Case No. RAB-III-10-1817-90 (prior money claims) would be discussed during CBA negotiation.  Wage adjustments and SSS registration promised. Union dues check-off agreed upon.  **Potential Issue:** The MOA, while recognizing the Union, contains a clause regarding discussion of pending claims during CBA negotiation, which the Labor Arbiter erroneously interpreted as a resolutory condition and not an obligation. The Supreme Court disagrees that the MOA was complied with.

*   **Unfair Labor Practice (ULP):** Alleged illegal lockout, union busting, harassment, and interference with employee rights to self-organization. **Challenge:** Petitioners needed to clearly specify violations under Art. 248 of the Labor Code to prove ULP.

*   **Illegal Dismissal/Abandonment:** Employer claimed employees abandoned work on January 21, 1991.  Employees argued illegal lockout/dismissal, filing a complaint shortly after the alleged abandonment.  **Relevant Case Law:** *De Ysasi III v. NLRC, 231 SCRA 173*; *Ranara v. NLRC, 212 SCRA 631*; *Dagupan Bus Co. v. NLRC, 191 SCRA 328*; *Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp. v. NLRC, 190 SCRA 505*; *Hua Bee Shirt Factory v. NLRC, 186 SCRA 586*; *Mabaylan v. NLRC, 203 SCRA 570*; *Flexo Manufacturing v. NLRC, 135 SCRA 145* establish that filing an illegal dismissal complaint shortly after the alleged abandonment negates abandonment claims.  One-day absence doesn't constitute abandonment. Employer has the burden of proving just cause.

*   **Underpayment of Wages:** Employees claimed underpayment; employer countered they were piece-rate workers ("pakiao"). Court ruled that employer compliance with minimum wage for 8-hour workday is required even for piece-rate workers.

*   **Employee Status:** Court considered workers' tasks necessary to the employer's business, long tenure, and year-round work to establish the workers are regular employees.

*   **Other Benefits:** Holiday pay, premium pay, 13th month pay, and service incentive leave. **Challenge:** Respondents need to prove adherence to wage standards per Sec. 8, Rule VII, Book III for piecemeal workers to be exempted.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Employer:** Has burden of proving just cause for termination (abandonment). Duty to provide notice of termination. Must comply with minimum wage laws even for piece-rate workers. Responsible for holiday pay, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave for regular employees.
*   **Employee:** Duty to provide sufficient evidence to prove unfair labor practice or illegal dismissal.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65 of the Rules of Court:** Certiorari
*   **Article 248 of the Labor Code:** Unfair Labor Practices
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code (as amended by R.A. No. 6715):** Reinstatement and backwages for illegal dismissal.
*   **Section 2, Rule XIV, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code:** Notice of Dismissal requirements.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   The determination of back wages and other benefits is remanded to the NLRC due to piece-rate nature of employment, requiring determination of individual production levels. The precise amounts owed to each worker are still uncertain.

**Outcome:**

*   Supreme Court **GRANTS** the Petition. NLRC and Labor Arbiter decisions **SET ASIDE**.
*   Employees declared illegally dismissed and entitled to backwages and other privileges.
*   Separation pay awarded in lieu of reinstatement (1 month per year of service).
*   Case remanded to the NLRC to determine backwages, other benefits, and separation pay amounts.
