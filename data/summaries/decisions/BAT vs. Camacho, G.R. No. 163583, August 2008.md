## Legal Document Summary: British American Tobacco vs. Camacho

**Case:** *British American Tobacco vs. Camacho*, G.R. No. 163583, August 20, 2008 (584 Phil. 489)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the constitutionality of Section 145 of the NIRC, RA 9334, Revenue Regulations Nos. 1-97, 9-2003, and 22-2003, and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 6-2003.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Section 145 NIRC (as amended by RA 8240 & RA 9334):**  This section imposes excise taxes on cigarettes packed by machine, establishing a multi-tiered tax system based on net retail price. Crucially, it includes a "classification freeze provision," where cigarette brands are classified based on their net retail price at a specific time (either 1996 for Annex "D" brands, or upon introduction for new brands), and this classification remains fixed unless revised by Congress.
*   **Annex "D":**  This annex lists existing cigarette brands as of October 1, 1996, and their corresponding tax classification. Its retention is challenged as discriminatory.
*   **Revenue Regulations Nos. 1-97, 9-2003, 22-2003, and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 6-2003:** Implementing rules allowing the BIR to periodically review and reclassify *new brands* of cigarettes, a process the petitioner argues is unauthorized and creates unequal tax burdens.

**Petitioner's Arguments (British American Tobacco):**

*   The classification freeze provision, specifically Annex "D," violates the **equal protection and uniformity of taxation clauses** of the Constitution because brands in Annex "D" continue to be taxed based on their 1996 prices, even if their current retail prices are higher than newer brands that are taxed at higher rates.
*   Revenue Regulations allowing periodic reclassification of *new brands* are *ultra vires* as the NIRC does not grant such power to the BIR.
*   Violation of GATT Article III, paragraph 2 due to discriminatory internal taxes.

**Respondents' Arguments (Secretary of Finance, Commissioner of BIR, Intervenors):**

*   No violation of equal protection or uniformity of taxation, as the classification freeze provision is rationally related to a legitimate state interest (simplifying tax administration, preventing corruption, ensuring stable revenue).
*   Legislative freeze applies to all brands after classification, not just Annex "D" brands, promoting predictability.
*   Courts cannot question the wisdom of legislative policy.
*   Petitioner is estopped from challenging the rules after initially complying with them.

**Court's Holdings:**

*   **Constitutionality of Section 145 NIRC (as amended by RA 9334):** UPHELD. The classification freeze provision does not violate equal protection or uniformity of taxation. The legislative classification is rationally related to legitimate state interests, including administrative efficiency, preventing corruption, and ensuring stable revenue.  The court deferred to the legislature's policy choices, emphasizing that it does not sit as a super-legislature.

*   **Validity of Revenue Regulations Nos. 1-97, 9-2003, and Revenue Memorandum Order No. 6-2003:** INVALIDATED IN PART. The provisions granting the BIR the power to *periodically reclassify* new brands every two years or earlier are *ultra vires*.  RA 8240 did not authorize this power.  The clear legislative intent was to apply the "freezing mechanism" to new brands after their initial classification, similar to Annex "D" brands.

*   **GATT Violation:**  No violation was proven. The classification freeze provision applies uniformly to all new brands, local and imported. Moreover, even if there were a conflict, the NIRC, as a later and more specific law, would prevail over the GATT.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act (RA) 8240:** An Act Amending Sections 138, 139, 140, and 142 of the NIRC, as Amended and For Other Purposes
*   **Republic Act (RA) 9334:** Act Increasing The Excise Tax Rates Imposed on Alcohol And Tobacco Products, Amending For The Purpose Sections 131, 141, 143, 144, 145 and 288 of the NIRC of 1997, As Amended
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Specifically, Section 145.
*   **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1947, Article III, paragraph 2:**  Non-discrimination in internal taxation.
*   **Sison, Jr. v. Ancheta (215 Phil. 582):** Established the applicable standard for equal protection challenges, including the "rational basis" test.
*   **Drilon v. Lim (G.R. No. 112497):**  Reiterated the power of the regular courts to determine the validity of laws and regulations.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Market Distortions:** Although the court upheld the classification freeze provision, it acknowledged that it *may* create market distortions, potentially hindering competition from new brands. This risk remains, though deemed within the legislature's discretion.
*   **Implementation Complexities:** The court's invalidation of the BIR's power to periodically reclassify new brands creates a need for Congress to act in order to address these distortions.
*   **"Legislative Classification Freeze":** The court's term for the mechanism and policy for tax classification, based on the current net retail price, may need to be defined to avoid further ambiguity.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the multi-tiered excise tax system for cigarettes under the NIRC (as amended by RA 8240 and RA 9334), finding that the classification freeze provision did not violate the equal protection or uniformity of taxation clauses. However, it invalidated the BIR's power to periodically reclassify new brands, deeming it *ultra vires*. While the court acknowledged potential market distortions, it deferred to the legislature's policy choices, placing the onus on Congress to address any resulting imbalances. The petition was partially granted.
