**Case Summary: *Apolonia Banayad Frianela vs. Servillano Banayad, Jr., G.R. No. 169700, July 30, 2009***

**Nature:** Petition for review on certiorari assailing a CA decision regarding the allowance of holographic wills and appointment of an administrator.

**Key Issue:** Lack of subject matter jurisdiction by the RTC in a probate proceeding (Sp. Proc. No. 3664-P) due to the absence of an averment regarding the gross value of the estate in the original petition.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court dismissed the probate proceeding for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the RTC of Pasay City erred in assuming jurisdiction, and the CA erred in overlooking this issue on appeal. The Court held that jurisdiction over probate proceedings (testate and intestate) under B.P. Blg. 129 (Sections 19 & 33, in force at the time of the action) is determined by the gross value of the estate, which must be alleged in the petition.  The court cited jurisprudence Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 124715, January 24, 2000, 380 Phil. 61, 70-71.

**Key Provisions/Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Jurisdictional Amount:** The ruling emphasizes the strict adherence to the jurisdictional threshold based on the gross value of the estate as mandated by B.P. Blg. 129. Failure to allege the estate's value in the petition renders the proceedings void *ab initio*.
*   **Duty of the Court:** The Court has a duty to *motu proprio* dismiss a case for lack of jurisdiction. *Rosa J. Sales, Earl Ryan Cheng and Emil Ralph Cheng v. William Barro, G.R. No. 171678, December 10, 2008*

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Waste of Resources:** Parties face the risk of wasted time, money, and effort if probate proceedings are initiated in the wrong court due to a failure to properly allege the estate's value.
*   **Void Proceedings:** All proceedings, including any decisions rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction, are null and void. *Hilario v. Salvador, G.R. No. 160384, April 29, 2005, 457 SCRA 815, 829*
*   **Delayed Resolution:** This case highlights the potential for significant delays (18 years in this instance) when jurisdictional defects are not identified and addressed promptly.
