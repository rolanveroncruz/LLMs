## Legal Document Summary: *Mandaue Dinghow Dimsum House, Co., Inc. vs. NLRC* (G.R. No. 161134, March 03, 2008)

**Core Issue:** Whether personal liability can be imposed on the President (Uytengsu) of a corporation (Mandaue Dinghow) for a labor judgment against the corporation after the judgment became final and executory, where the initial decision absolved the President of liability.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Closure of Business:** Mandaue Dinghow closed due to business losses, leading to termination of employees (private respondents). A notice of retrenchment was filed with the DOLE.
*   **Labor Arbiter's (LA) Original Decision:** Found Mandaue Dinghow liable for separation pay but absolved Uytengsu. This decision was *not* appealed by the private respondents concerning the absolution of Uytengsu.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Modified the LA's decision, increasing the total amount of separation pay and designating specific amounts for each respondent. Crucially, the NLRC decision *only* named Mandaue Dinghow as the liable party.
*   **Finality of NLRC Decision:** The NLRC decision became final and executory.
*   **Alias Writ of Execution:** Despite the final judgment against Mandaue Dinghow *only*, the LA issued an alias writ of execution against both Mandaue Dinghow and Uytengsu personally, based on a "piercing the veil" argument.

**Obligations:**

*   The NLRC decision explicitly obligates *Mandaue Dinghow* to pay separation pay to the private respondents.

**Liabilities:**

*   Initially, only Mandaue Dinghow was held liable. The attempt to impose personal liability on Uytengsu via the alias writ is the central point of contention.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** The main risk is the imposition of personal liability on Uytengsu through the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil. The court examines whether Uytengsu acted with malice or bad faith, considering the LA's initial finding *against* such conduct.
*   **Alteration of Final Judgment:** The alias writ of execution effectively altered a final judgment. This raises jurisdictional concerns.
*   **Finality of Original Decision:**  The original LA decision finding the president not liable for malice or bad faith attained finality, so the private respondents could not belatedly invoke the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction against Uytengsu.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 65, Rules of Civil Procedure:** Governs certiorari petitions and the requirement for a motion for reconsideration.
*   ***Industrial Management International Development Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission* (G.R. No. 101723, May 11, 2000):**  Reinforces the principle that a final and executory judgment is immutable and cannot be altered or amended by the court that rendered it.
*   ***Malayang Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa M. Greenfield v. Ramos*** **(G.R. No. 113907, 20 April 2001):** Addresses the solidary liability of corporate directors and officers for terminations done with malice or bad faith.
*   **Corporation Law (implied):** Discusses the separate legal personality of corporations.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The NLRC decision, while modifying the separation pay amounts, did not explicitly address Uytengsu's liability, creating ambiguity.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court *granted* the petition, reversing the CA's decision. The Alias Writ of Execution was quashed, and the LA was ordered to implement the NLRC decision against the assets of *Mandaue Dinghow Dimsum House Co., Inc.* only. The Court held that the NLRC's decision finding only the company liable had already become final and executory and thus could no longer be modified. Furthermore, it said the attempt to hold the president personally liable was improper because the LA's original decision had found the president not liable for malice or bad faith, so the private respondents could not belatedly invoke the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction against Uytengsu.
