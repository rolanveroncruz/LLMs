Here's a legal summary of *Jaguar Security and Investigation Agency v. Sales* (G.R. No. 162420, April 22, 2008) formatted for a lawyer:

**Case Summary: *Jaguar Security and Investigation Agency v. Sales***

**Facts:**

*   Security guards (Respondents) employed by Jaguar Security (Petitioner), a security agency, and assigned to Delta Milling (Delta), filed a labor complaint against Jaguar and Delta for wage differentials, overtime pay, rest day/holiday pay, 13th-month pay, and service incentive leave. Some also claimed illegal dismissal.
*   Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of the guards on monetary claims, holding Jaguar and Delta jointly and severally liable, but dismissed the illegal dismissal claims.
*   Jaguar filed a cross-claim against Delta, seeking reimbursement for any payments made to the guards, arguing Delta, as principal, was liable for the wage increases under Wage Orders NCR-04, NCR-05, and NCR-06, citing *Eagle Security Agency v. NLRC*.
*   NLRC dismissed Jaguar's appeal and cross-claim, holding Jaguar primarily liable as the direct employer and directing Jaguar to file a separate civil action against Delta. CA affirmed the NLRC decision.

**Issue:**

Whether the NLRC and CA erred in not resolving Jaguar's cross-claim against Delta Milling in the labor case.

**Holding:**

No.  The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision denying Jaguar's petition.

**Key Provisions & Reasoning:**

*   **Joint and Several Liability (Articles 106, 107, 109, Labor Code):** The Court reiterates that Jaguar, as the employer, is primarily liable for wages and benefits. Delta, as principal, is indirectly liable. This joint and several liability ensures workers are paid.
*   **Right to Reimbursement (Article 1217, Civil Code):** Jaguar has a right to seek reimbursement from Delta *after* it actually pays its employees the adjudged liabilities. *Urbanes v. Secretary of Labor* is cited regarding payment as the operative fact.
*   **Jurisdiction (Article 217, Labor Code):** Labor courts' jurisdiction is limited to cases involving employer-employee relationships.
*   **Cross-Claim Jurisdiction:** The cross-claim for reimbursement between Jaguar and Delta is a civil matter outside the NLRC's jurisdiction. There is no employer-employee relationship between Jaguar and Delta.  The action is governed by civil law, as per *Lapanday Agricultural Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals*.  *Lapanday* also held that a contractor cannot assert a claim for wage adjustments not actually paid to the employees.
*   **Prematurity of Claim:** Jaguar's cross-claim is premature because it had not yet paid the security guards the amounts due.

**Obligations:**

*   Jaguar has the primary obligation to pay its employees the wages and benefits awarded by the Labor Arbiter.

**Liabilities:**

*   Jaguar is directly liable to its employees for the monetary claims.

**Potential Risks:**

*   Jaguar must satisfy the judgment in favor of the guards and *then* pursue a separate civil action against Delta for reimbursement. This entails additional litigation costs and risks associated with proving Delta's liability.
*   If Jaguar fails to pay the employees, it faces potential legal action and penalties.
*   Delta may contest its liability for reimbursement, potentially leading to a protracted legal battle.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   *Eagle Security Agency, Inc. v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 81314, May 18, 1989, 173 SCRA 479) - Distinguished based on the need to first establish actual payment.
*   *Lapanday Agricultural Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals* (381 Phil. 41 (2000)) -  Key precedent regarding jurisdiction over reimbursement claims and the requirement of actual payment.
*   *Urbanes, Jr. v. Secretary of Labor and Employment* (445 Phil. 718, 728 (2003)) - Affirms that payment triggers the right to seek reimbursement.
*   Article 1217, Civil Code (Solidary Obligations)
*   Articles 106, 107, 109, Labor Code (Contracting and Subcontracting)
*   Article 217, Labor Code (Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters)
*   Wage Orders NCR-04, NCR-05, NCR-06 (Wage Increases)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The precise terms of the security service contract between Jaguar and Delta are not detailed in the decision, which could be relevant in determining the scope of Delta's reimbursement obligation. A closer examination of the contract is warranted.

**Recommendations:**

1.  Ensure full compliance with the Labor Arbiter's judgment to avoid further penalties.
2.  Prepare and file a separate civil action against Delta Milling for reimbursement, focusing on proving the terms of the security service contract and Delta's obligation to cover the wage increases.
3.  Preserve all documentation related to wage payments and the security service contract to support the reimbursement claim.
