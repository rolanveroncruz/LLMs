Here's a legal summary of the provided Supreme Court decision, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Resort Hotels Corporation v. Development Bank of the Philippines and SM Investment Corporation* (G.R. No. 180439, December 23, 2009)

**Summary:** This case involves a challenge to the extrajudicial foreclosure of properties mortgaged by Resort Hotels Corporation (RHC) to Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). RHC, along with Rodolfo Cuenca and Cuenca Investment Corporation, sued DBP and SM Investment Corporation (SMIC), seeking to annul the foreclosure and related sales.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Validity of Foreclosure:** The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the Court of Appeals (CA)'s reversal of the trial court, finding that RHC failed to prove non-compliance with the notice, posting, and publication requirements of Act No. 3135. The burden of proof rests with the mortgagor (RHC) to demonstrate invalidity.  Self-serving testimony, unsubstantiated by documentary evidence, is insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity in foreclosure proceedings. The Certificates of Sale presented by DBP held weight.
*   **Fire Insurance Proceeds:** The SC affirmed the CA's rejection of RHC's claim to use fire insurance proceeds from the Baguio Pines Hotel specifically to *redeem* that property. Per *Development Bank of the Philippines v. West Negros College, Inc.*, RHC must still satisfy the *entire* outstanding obligation.
*   **Amount of Obligation:**  The SC *reinstated* the trial court's finding that RHC's loan obligation to DBP was fixed at P114,005,404.02 as of January 11, 1984, with 12% interest per annum. The CA's computation of P612,476,182.08 was rejected due to the inadmissibility of the Statement of Total Claim as hearsay evidence (Rule 130, Sec. 36 of the Rules of Court).  The persons who prepared the documentation were not available for cross examination.
*   **Rodolfo Cuenca's Liability:** The SC discharged Rodolfo Cuenca from personal liability, agreeing with the trial court that there was no sufficient evidence of his undertaking to be jointly and solidarily liable for RHC's debt to DBP.
*   **Debt-to-Equity Conversion:** RHC argued the loan obligation was extinguished by confusion, but failed to show that such a claim was sufficient to invalidate the foreclosure.
*   **SMIC Status** SMIC was deemed a buyer in bad faith due to a notice of lis pendens, and was bound by the judgement.

**Obligations:**

*   RHC remains obligated to DBP for the loan amount of P114,005,404.02, plus 12% interest, less the fire insurance proceeds for Baguio Pines Hotel.

**Liabilities:**

*   RHC is liable to DBP for the aforementioned debt.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Interest Calculation:** While the SC fixed the principal amount, further litigation could arise regarding the precise calculation of interest and application of insurance proceeds.
*   **SMIC's position**: the courts found SMIC to be a buyer in bad faith; this could give RHC leverage in further litigation

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135:**  Relating to extrajudicial foreclosure. The central statute in dispute.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 385**: â€œThe Law on Mandatory Foreclosure." The SC makes mention of this law with respect to DBP's actions
*   **Rule 131 and Rule 133 of the Rules of Court:** Regarding burden of proof and preponderance of evidence.  Crucial to the SC's decision on the validity of the foreclosure.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. West Negros College, Inc.*** (G.R. No. 152359, October 28, 2002):  Relevant precedent on the application of insurance proceeds.
*   **Rule 130, Sec. 36 of the Rules of Court**: Hearsay rule. Used to reject the documentation from the CA.
*   ***Philippine National Bank v. Nepomuceno Productions, Inc.*** (G.R. No citation): Cited by the CA to demonstrate that personal notice to the mortgagor is not always necessary for the validity of foreclosure proceedings.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The precise terms of Rodolfo Cuenca's guarantee (or lack thereof) were apparently unclear, leading to the finding of no personal liability. The factual record on this point would be key.
