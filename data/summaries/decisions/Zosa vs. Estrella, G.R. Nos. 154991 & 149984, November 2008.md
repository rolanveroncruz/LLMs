**Case Summary: *Spouses Zosa v. Estrella*, G.R. Nos. 149984 & 154991 (November 28, 2008)**

**Facts:** Spouses Zosa (Petitioners) defaulted on a loan from Chinatrust (Respondent Bank), leading to extrajudicial foreclosure of their property. They filed an action for injunction, specific performance, and damages to stop the foreclosure, obtaining a preliminary injunction. The RTC subsequently dismissed the case for failure to prosecute and dissolved the injunction. The Spouses Zosa then filed both a Notice of Appeal (CA-G.R. CV No. 69892) and a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus (CA-G.R. SP No. 62915) with the Court of Appeals, challenging the same RTC orders. Chailease Finance Corporation (Respondent) purchased the property at auction and registered it. The CA dismissed both the petition for certiorari and the appeal.

**Key Legal Issues:** Whether the Spouses Zosa engaged in forum shopping by simultaneously pursuing an appeal and a petition for certiorari to challenge the same RTC orders, and whether the dismissals by the Court of Appeals were proper.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's dismissals, holding that the Spouses Zosa engaged in forum shopping. The court emphasized that the remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive and not alternative or cumulative. Filing both constitutes an attempt to obtain a favorable judgment by trying the same case in different fora simultaneously.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Loan Agreement:** Implied; breach triggers foreclosure rights for Chinatrust.
*   **Mortgage Agreement:** Grants Chinatrust the right to extrajudicial foreclosure.
*   **Rules of Court (specifically Rule 44, Sec. 13(c) and (d); Rule 50, Section 1(f))**: Rules regarding page referencing in Appellant's Brief and grounds for dismissal of appeals, particularly the issue of forum shopping.
*   **Obligation to prosecute case:** The petitioners' failure to prosecute the initial action in the RTC led to its dismissal.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Spouses Zosa:** Liable for the outstanding loan amount. They lose the property to foreclosure.
*   **Potential Liability for sanctions related to forum shopping.**

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Loss of Property:** The extrajudicial foreclosure and subsequent registration of the property in Chailease's name solidifies their loss.
*   **Sanctions for Forum Shopping:** Although not explicitly mentioned, further sanctions are possible for the prohibited act of forum shopping.
*   **Res Judicata:** The judgment in this case bars relitigation of the issues.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Young v. Sy, G.R. Nos. 157745 and 157955, September 26, 2006, 503 SCRA 151:**  Applied directly to the facts, setting the precedent for defining and penalizing forum shopping in this specific context (appeal and certiorari).
*   **Candido v. Camacho, 424 Phil. 291 (2002):** Reinforces the ruling in *Young v. Sy* regarding forum shopping.
*   **Guaranteed Hotels, Inc. v. Baltao** Stresses the grave evil sought to be avoided by the rule against forum shopping is the rendition by two competent tribunals of two separate and contradictory decisions.
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 44, Section 13(c) and (d) (Appellant's brief requirements), Rule 50, Section 1(f) (Grounds for dismissal of appeal).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Areas:**

*   The document lacks specifics of the Loan Agreement, Mortgage Agreement, or the circumstances leading to the initial failure to prosecute. This is critical to know what defense would have been viable.
*   Whether the CA correctly assessed the procedural lapses in the appellant's brief is not explicitly argued; rather, the court focused on the forum shopping issue.
*   The decision does not elaborate on why the remedy of ordinary appeal was deemed inadequate.

**Overall Assessment for Legal Action:**

The petitioners' legal position is extremely weak due to the blatant forum shopping. Absent compelling new evidence or a strong argument demonstrating a denial of due process *independent* of the forum shopping issue, further appeals would likely be unsuccessful and potentially sanctionable.
