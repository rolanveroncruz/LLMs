**Legal Document Summary: *Heirs of Tranquilino Labiste vs. Heirs of Jose Labiste***

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 162033, May 8, 2009 (605 Phil. 495)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' Decision reversing the RTC decision in a case involving ownership and reconveyance of land (Lot No. 1054 of the Banilad Friar Lands Estate).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Affidavit of Epifanio (1923):** Key document establishing an express trust. Affirms co-ownership of Lot No. 1054 between Epifanio Labiste (representing heirs of Jose Labiste) and Tranquilino Labiste. The Court considers this as a trust agreement under Article 1444 of the Civil Code.
*   **Calig-onan sa Panagpalit (1939):** Private document evidencing the purported sale of the heirs of Jose Labiste's share to the heirs of Tranquilino Labiste for P300.00. Court acknowledges validity of the document, but notes action to compel for public document has prescribed.
*   **Reconstituted Title (TCT No. RT-7853):** Issued in the name of "Epifanio Labiste, married to Tomasa Mabitad, his brothers and sisters, heirs of Jose Labiste." The Court notes the reconstitution doesn't expand underlying rights.

**Obligations:**

*   **Trustee (Heirs of Jose Labiste/Epifanio Labiste):** Obligation to hold and manage the property for the benefit of the beneficiary (Heirs of Tranquilino Labiste) due to the express trust established in the Affidavit.
*   **Heirs of Jose Labiste:** Obligation to execute a public deed of sale based on the *Calig-onan sa Panagpalit* (already prescribed).

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Prescription:** The Court of Appeals erred in applying the rules on prescription as it applied the rules from time of loss of possession which occurred after WWII. Court ruled the applicable prescription period begins at the time of clear repudiation, in this case the filing of the reconstitution in October 1993. The action was filed in January 1995, making it timely.
*   **Laches:** Similarly, Court of Appeals was reversed because laches is not applicable due to timely filing after the clear repudiation of the Trust.
*   **Validity of *Calig-onan sa Panagpalit:*** Though deemed valid as an ancient document, the action to compel the execution of a public deed of sale (to fully transfer ownership of that share) based on it has prescribed, preventing the Heirs of Tranquilino Labiste from claiming 100% ownership as it would have solidified the *Calig-onan sa Panagpalit*.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1444, Civil Code:** No particular words required for creation of an express trust if a trust is clearly intended.
*   **Article 1144, Civil Code:** Action upon a written contract prescribes in ten (10) years.  Relevance lies in the prescribed action to compel.
*   **Act No. 190 (Old Code of Civil Procedure), Section 43:**  (Applicable because *Calig-onan* was executed in 1939) Provides 10-year prescription period for actions upon a written contract.
*   **Pilapil v. Heirs of Maximino R. Briones, G.R. No. 150175, February 5, 2007, 514 SCRA 197, 214-215:** Outlines requirements for acquisitive prescription to bar an action in express trust (unequivocal repudiation known to beneficiary).
*   **Sotto v. Teves, 175 Phil. 343, 365 (1978):** Registration of property under Torrens title by a trustee does not, by itself, constitute repudiation of the trust.
*   **Mojica v. Fernandez, 9 Phil. 403 (1907); Araneta v. Montelibano, 14 Phil. 117 (1909):** Regarding the obligation of heirs to execute documents to fulfill contracts of their predecessors.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Points:**

*   **Repudiation of Trust:** The crucial point lies in determining when the trust was effectively repudiated.  The Court identified the filing for reconstitution as the key act.
*   **Remedy for *Calig-onan sa Panagpalit:* The failure to timely file an action to compel the execution of a public deed of sale based on this document limits the heirs of Tranquilino Labiste to only claiming their equitable share (half) in the lot by virtue of the express Trust.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court partially granted the petition, reversing the Court of Appeals and reinstating the RTC decision with modification. The Heirs of Tranquilino Labiste were declared the absolute owners of one-half of the Lot No. 1054 by virtue of the express trust. The Register of Deeds was ordered to cancel the existing title and issue a new Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of the Heirs of Tranquilino Labiste covering Lot No. 1054-A.
