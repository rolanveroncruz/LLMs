## Legal Document Summary: *Bildner vs. Ilusorio*, G.R. No. 157384, June 5, 2009 (606 Phil. 369)

**Nature:** Petition for Indirect Contempt and Disbarment/Disciplinary Action.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Erlinda I. Bildner and Maximo K. Ilusorio (Daughter and Son of Potenciano Ilusorio).
*   **Respondents:** Erlinda K. Ilusorio (Mother, wife of Potenciano), Ramon K. Ilusorio, Marietta K. Ilusorio, Shereen K. Ilusorio, Cecilia A. Bisu√±a, and Atty. Manuel R. Singson (Counsel).

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

1.  **Indirect Contempt:**
    *   **Basis:** Alleged contemptuous pleadings, letters to the Chief Justice, and publication of a book ("On the Edge of Heaven") criticizing the Supreme Court's handling of a prior habeas corpus case.
    *   **Ruling:** The court finds Erlinda K. Ilusorio guilty of indirect contempt solely based on the statements in "On the Edge of Heaven." Specifically, claims insinuating the court's complicity in breaking up her family, favoring wealthy litigants, delaying resolutions, and selling justice. This exceeded permissible bounds of fair criticism.
    *   **Contempt Standard:** Applied the standard that criticism must be "bona fide" and not "spill over the walls of decency and propriety."  Cited *In re Almacen* and *People v. Godoy*. Notes that contempt can be found even after a case ends, if necessary to protect the court's integrity.
    *   **Other Respondents:** The other respondents were not held liable for the acts of Erlinda, particularly regarding the book, because of lack of evidence of their participation and that Erlinda was authorized to publish the book.
    *   **Penalty:** Fine of PhP 10,000 for Erlinda K. Ilusorio.

2.  **Disbarment/Disciplinary Action (Atty. Singson):**
    *   **Basis:** Alleged attempted bribery and gross misconduct for attempting to influence Regional Trial Court Judge Reyes in *Civil Case No. 4537-R* (Ramon K. Ilusorio v. Baguio Country Club) by giving money to Judge Reyes' classmate.
    *   **Evidence:**
        *   Transcript of May 31, 2000 hearing where Judge Reyes publicly accused Atty. Singson.
        *   Affidavit of Judge Reyes detailing the alleged attempted bribery through Atty. Sevilla (Judge's classmate).
        *   Affidavit of Atty. Sevilla confirming contact by Atty. Singson to intercede on the case.
    *   **Ruling:** While direct evidence of bribery was lacking, the totality of circumstances, including Atty. Singson's admitted contacts with Judge Reyes, and the affidavits of the judge and Atty. Sevilla, supported a finding of unethical behavior, specifically attempting to influence a judge.
    *   **Canon Violation:** Violated Canon 13 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, requiring lawyers to rely on the merits of their cause and refrain from impropriety.
    *   **Penalty:** Suspension from the practice of law for one (1) year.

**Statutory/Rule References:**

*   Rule 71, Sections 3(d) and 7 of the Rules of Court (Indirect Contempt)
*   Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 13 (Lawyer's Duty of Candor and Fairness)

**Case Law References:**

*   *In re Almacen* (Standards for permissible criticism of courts)
*   *People v. Godoy* (Distinction between criticism and insult; Contempt standards)
*   *Wicker v. Arcangel* (Principles governing the exercise of contempt power)
*   *In Re: Wenceslao Laureta*(Letters to individual Justices)
*   *Mercado v. Security Bank Corporation* (Purpose of contempt power)
*   *Montenegro v. Montenegro* (Civil vs. Criminal Contempt)

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Hearsay Evidence in Disbarment:** Reliance on Judge Reyes' account of the bribe offer, even if it was an emotional outburst.
*   **Proof of Intent:** The absence of direct evidence of attempted bribery.
*   **Severity of Sanction:** The court is aware that the disbarment could be seen as too harsh given the relative lack of clear and convincing evidence.

**Overall:** The Supreme Court upheld its authority by punishing what it considered disrespectful attacks on the judiciary, while also disciplining an attorney for unethical behavior. The case highlights the need for respect towards the courts while allowing for legitimate criticisms.
