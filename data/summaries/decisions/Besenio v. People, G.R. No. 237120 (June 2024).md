## Legal Document Summary: *Alex Besenio v. People*, G.R. No. 237120

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's affirmance of Besenio's conviction for violation of R.A. 9165, Section 11 (illegal possession of dangerous drugs).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and acquitted Besenio due to a failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody, despite a judicial admission by defense counsel.

**Key Provisions & Chain of Custody Issues:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21 (as it existed *prior* to the 2014 amendment by R.A. 10640):** The Court emphasizes the importance of the chain of custody rule for preserving the integrity of seized drugs.
*   **First Link (Seizure & Marking):** Deviations from the prescribed procedure occurred, specifically:
    *   **Lack of Required Insulating Witnesses:** The law requires the presence of a media representative, a DOJ representative, and an elected public official during the inventory and photography of the seized drugs immediately after seizure. Here, initially only two barangay officials (elected public officials) were present at the place of seizure.  A second inventory at the police station included a media representative but still lacked a DOJ representative.
    *   The Court cites *Nisperos v. People*, G.R. No. 250927, providing guidelines for marking, inventory, and photography. The lack of justification for non-compliance with these guidelines raised doubt about the integrity of the evidence.
*   **Judicial Admission:** Defense counsel conceded that the specimen found in Besenio's house was the same one submitted to the crime laboratory. This admission waived the need for proof regarding the first three links in the chain of custody.
*   **Fourth Link (Forensic Chemist to Court):** The prosecution failed to prove compliance with the fourth link because the forensic chemist, PINSP Severo, failed to adequately testify about the handling, storage, and preservation of the specimen after examination, including whether the specimen was resealed and how it was stored prior to being submitted to the RTC.

**Liabilities & Obligations:**

*   **Prosecution's Burden:** The prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the identity and unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs, as the drugs are the *corpus delicti*. The accusedâ€™s defense of denial does not overcome the prosecution's obligations.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Defense Counsel's Admission:** The Court acknowledges the inherent tension between the prosecution's burden of proving the chain of custody and the defense's judicial admission. While the admission validated the chain of custody up to a point, it did not excuse the prosecution from proving the fourth link.
*   **Justification for Non-Compliance:** The lack of a persuasive justification for the absence of a DOJ representative (it was too early in the morning) was deemed insufficient.
*   **Fourth Link Deficiencies:** The Court found PINSP Severo's testimony lacking specific details about resealing, storage, and handling, which was enough to negate the judicial admission

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 9165, Section 11 (Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs):** The substantive offense.
*   **R.A. 9165, Section 21 (Chain of Custody):** The procedural safeguard, central to the decision.
*   **R.A. 10640 (Amendment to R.A. 9165):** Relevant as the offense occurred *before* the amendment, requiring three insulating witnesses.
*   **Nisperos v. People, G.R. No. 250927:** Sets out specific guidelines for compliance with Section 21.

**Conclusion:** The Supreme Court, while recognizing the defense's admission regarding the identity of the substance, ultimately acquitted Besenio because the prosecution failed to establish the integrity and unbroken chain of custody through the fourth link, due to the inadequate testimony of the forensic chemist.
