**Case:** Heirs of Limense vs. Vda. de Ramos, G.R. No. 152319 (Oct. 28, 2009)

**Summary:** This case involves a dispute over land ownership and easement of right of way between the Heirs of Joaquin Limense (Petitioners) and the Heirs of Francisco Ramos (Respondents). Limense's heirs sought to remove an encroachment by the Ramos heirs' house onto Lot 12-C, owned by Limense. The lower courts ruled in favor of the Ramos heirs, recognizing an existing easement of right of way.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Land Ownership:** Limense held TCT No. 96886 for Lot 12-C. The Court confirms that the validity of a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked (PD 1529, Sec. 48). This invalidates the Respondents' attempt to question the validity of the Limense title in the current action.
*   **Easement of Right of Way:** Despite the lack of annotation on TCT No. 96886, the Court upheld the existence of an apparent discontinuous easement of right of way benefiting Lot 12-D (occupied by the Ramos heirs) over Lot 12-C. This determination relies on the long-standing use of Lot 12-C as an alley by the Ramos heirs and others, coupled with the knowledge of Limense and his predecessors of this use (citing Mendoza v. Rosel). The court cites Article 622 and states that discontinuous and apparent easement can only be acquired by virtue of a title.
*   **Encroachment & Good Faith:** The Ramos heirs' house partially encroached onto Lot 12-C. The Court determined that their predecessor-in-interest was a builder in good faith, citing their partial ownership of Lot 12-C at the time of construction and lack of evidence demonstrating bad faith (Art. 448, New Civil Code).
*   **Application of Article 448:** The case triggers the application of Article 448 of the Civil Code. The Limense heirs are given the option to (1) appropriate the encroaching portion by paying indemnity (Art. 546) or (2) compel the Ramos heirs to purchase the land. If the land value is significantly higher, Ramos heirs will pay reasonable rent. Ramos heirs retain option to demolish encroachment.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioners (Heirs of Limense):** Must respect the easement of right of way. The case is remanded to RTC so that the petitioners may choose between options according to Article 448 and the proper indemnity can be made.
*   **Respondents (Heirs of Ramos):** Subject to the options under Article 448. If Limense heirs elect to have the encroachment removed, Ramos heirs liable for the cost.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Issues:** Determining the value of the land occupied by the encroachment and the amount of reasonable rent if sale is not feasible could lead to further disputes.
*   **Scope of Easement:** The exact scope and limitations of the right of way are not explicitly defined. This could be a source of future conflict.
*   **Good Faith Argument:** While determined in this case, good faith can always be a point of contention if new evidence is presented during the remand.
*   **Remand Proceedings:** The RTC proceedings on remand could be lengthy and costly.
*  **Article 622 Argument:** While the ruling ultimately sides with the Ramos heirs, it would be important to reconcile this with the statement that discontinuous and apparent easements can only be acquired by virtue of a title.
