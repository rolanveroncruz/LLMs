**Case Summary: *Asean Pacific Planners v. City of Urdaneta***

**Court & Date:** Supreme Court, G.R. No. 162525, September 23, 2008

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing Court of Appeals Resolutions that dismissed a petition for certiorari relating to an RTC case involving the annulment of contracts.

**Key Issue:** Whether the RTC erred in entertaining taxpayers' suits, allowing private counsel to represent the City, allowing parties to switch sides, and allowing a change of attorneys.

**Facts:**

*   Taxpayers filed suit to annul contracts between Urdaneta City and Asean Pacific Planners for the construction of a commercial center/hotel. They allege the contracts are void because they involved public land devoted to public use and were awarded solely to the Goco family.
*   The City initially defended the contracts but then sought to realign as a plaintiff, claiming inadequate legal representation.
*   A contractor (Capalad), initially a defendant, also sought to become a plaintiff.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition and SET ASIDE the Court of Appeals resolutions.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Taxpayers' Suits:** The Court affirmed the right of taxpayers to sue, citing *Public Interest Center, Inc. v. Roxas*, because the allegation of overpayment from a loan which the city acquired is considered illegal disbursement of public funds. The allegation that the loan is serviced/paid through public funds is sufficient basis for standing to sue.
*   **Legal Representation:** The Court held that the Lazaro Law Firm's representation of Urdaneta City was improper. Under Section 481 of the Local Government Code, the City Prosecutor (or City Legal Officer if the position existed) is the proper legal representative. Citing *Ramos v. Court of Appeals*, because Urdaneta City lacked a City Legal Officer, the City Prosecutor should represent the city. Public funds cannot be used to hire private lawyers. The court ordered the City Prosecutor to represent the city.
*   **Amendment of Pleadings:** The Court held that the RTC did not err in allowing Urdaneta City to switch from defendant to plaintiff and amend their answer. Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court permits amendment of pleadings, especially given the issues were framed at pre-trial. The court has leeway to consider other evidence, as judicial admissions may not prevail over documentary evidence.
*   **Change of Attorneys:** The court affirmed the RTC's acceptance of Capalad's complaint, stating the conflicting interest warranted the dropping of Atty. Sahagun.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Validity of Contracts:** The central issue of the contracts' validity remains unresolved and must be addressed by the trial court on remand. There is the risk that the contracts will be declared invalid due to, *inter alia*, illegal encroachment on public land.
*   **Financial Exposure:** If the contracts are deemed invalid, the City could face significant financial exposure related to payments made to the contractors.
*   **Conflict of Interest:** Atty. Sahagun cannot represent conflicting interests.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Section 481 of the Local Government Code:** Governing the legal representation of LGUs.
*   **Section 5, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court:** Permits the amendment of pleadings.
*   ***Public Interest Center, Inc. v. Roxas***: Defines when a taxpayer suit is proper.
*   ***Ramos v. Court of Appeals***: Clarifies that the City Prosecutor represents city in the absence of City Legal Officer

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The validity of the contracts is the contentious area of the agreement and would dictate much of the potential exposure of the parties.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Key areas of focus are the validity of the contracts and the potential conflict of interest. The case highlights the importance of compliance with the Local Government Code regarding legal representation of LGUs.
