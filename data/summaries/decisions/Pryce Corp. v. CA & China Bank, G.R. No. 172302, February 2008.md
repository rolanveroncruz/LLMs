## Legal Document Summary: Pryce Corporation vs. Court of Appeals & China Banking Corporation (G.R. No. 172302)

**Case Summary:** This case involves a petition for corporate rehabilitation filed by Pryce Corporation following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.  The Court of Appeals (CA) reversed the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) approval of Pryce's Amended Rehabilitation Plan. The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CA decision, but remanded the case to the RTC for further proceedings to properly determine the merits of the petition for rehabilitation.

**Key Provisions of Pryce's Proposed Rehabilitation Plan:**

*   **Dacion en Pago:** Primarily relies on dacion en pago (payment in kind) of mortgaged assets and memorial park lots to settle debts with bank and trade creditors.
*   **Valuation:** Assets (excluding memorial lots) to be valued based on the average of two independent appraisals. Memorial park lots were assigned a fixed value.
*   **Waiver of Penalties:** Creditors to waive penalties.
*   **Interest Accrual:** Interest on loans to be accrued only up to June 30, 2003.
*   **SPV Law Benefits:** Creditors to utilize the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Law (R.A. No. 9182) for tax exemptions; any failure to do so would result in the creditor shouldering the applicable taxes.
*   **Foreign Currency Conversion:** USD-denominated debt to China Banking Corporation to be converted to PHP using the average exchange rate for 2003.

**Key Provisions of the Amended Rehabilitation Plan Recommended by the Rehabilitation Receiver:**

*   **Payment of all bank loans and long-term commercial papers (LTCP) through dacion en pago of PCâ€™s real estate assets.**
*   **Payment of all non-bank, trade and other payables amounting to at least P500,000 each through a dacion of memorial park lots.**
*   **Payment in cash over a three-year period, without interest, of all non-bank, trade and other payables amounting to less than P500,000 each.**
*   **Each creditor will no longer be limited to assets already mortgaged to it and may elect to be paid from the many other assets of the company, including even those mortgaged to other creditors. Any secured creditor, however, shall have priority to acquire the assets mortgaged to it.**
*   **A third appraiser has been added to the two proposed by PC to undertake valuation of assets earmarked for dacion. With three appraisers, more representative values are likely to be obtained.**
*   **Valuation of the memorial lots has been configured to dovetail with values approved in the corporate rehabilitation of Pryce Gases, Inc. (PGI), a subsidiary of PC. Thus, any memorial lot ceded to secured creditors shall be valued at P13,125 per lot, and P17,500/lot for unsecured creditors.**

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Pryce Corporation:** Obligation to execute the Rehabilitation Plan upon approval. The Plan includes transferring assets via dacion en pago and other payment terms. Pryce is liable for the consequences of failing to adhere to the Plan.
*   **Creditors:** (Assuming the Plan is eventually approved by the RTC), Creditors are obligated to accept dacion en pago and adhere to the prescribed valuation methods and timelines. Creditors failing to utilize SPV Law benefits will be liable for applicable taxes.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Dacion en Pago Valuation:** The fixed valuation of memorial park lots (especially in the original plan) is contentious. Creditors argue this forces them to accept unwanted assets at potentially inflated prices, shifting the burden of selling these assets to them. This may be considered an impairment of the creditor's right under the original credit agreement (contractual obligation).
*   **Coercive Rehabilitation:**  The CA and some creditors allege that the petition is coercive, essentially forcing creditors to accept the dacion scheme on Pryce's terms.
*   **"Serious Situation Test":** The RTC's initial approval and issuance of the Stay Order were premature, as the RTC failed to conduct a proper hearing to establish that Pryce met the "serious situation test" outlined in *Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court* (G.R. No. 74851).  The Court noted there was no imminent danger of losing corporate assets that would necessitate the appointment of a receiver.
*   **Impairment of Contracts:** China Banking Corporation argued that the Amended Rehabilitation Plan impaired the obligations of contracts and voided contractual stipulations. This is a potential violation of constitutional protection against impairment of obligations of contracts.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC):** Section 6 regarding the Stay Order and requirements for a petition.
*   **Republic Act No. 9182 (Special Purpose Vehicle Act of 2002):** Provides tax exemptions and benefits for asset transfers under the Rehabilitation Plan.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 902-A:** Section 6(c) regarding the appointment of receivers, as interpreted in *RCBC v. IAC*.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court (G.R. No. 74851):** Established the "serious situation test" for appointing a receiver. This is critical to the court's decision and the remand of the case.
*   **National Development Company and New Agrix, Inc. v. Philippine Veterans Bank, G.R. Nos. 84132-33, December 10, 1990, 192 SCRA 257:** An imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets or of paralization of business operations of the liquid corporation which may be prejudicial to the interest of minority stockholders, parties-litigants or to the general public.
*   **Constitution of the Philippines:** Guarantee against impairment of the obligations of contracts.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The definition of "ordinary course of business" in the Stay Order could be subject to interpretation and potential abuse by Pryce.
*   The requirement for creditors to use the SPV Law is ambiguous regarding what constitutes "through its own fault" in failing to avail of the exemptions.

**Legal Advice:**

*   Thorough examination of Pryce's financial situation and the value of its assets is crucial to determine the fairness and viability of the dacion en pago scheme.
*   The RTC must conduct a rigorous hearing to properly assess whether Pryce meets the legal requirements for corporate rehabilitation, specifically the "serious situation test" articulated in *RCBC v. IAC*.
*   Evaluate the potential for impairment of contract claims based on specific loan agreements and the proposed changes under the Rehabilitation Plan.
*   Consider seeking independent appraisals of the assets offered for dacion to challenge the valuations in the Plan.
*   Carefully analyze the potential tax implications under the SPV Law.
