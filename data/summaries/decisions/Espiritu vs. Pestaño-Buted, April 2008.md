**Date:** April 30, 2008

**Holding:** Administrative charges against Judge Erlinda Pesta単o-Buted are dismissed for lack of merit and insufficiency of evidence.

**Summary:**

This is a consolidated administrative case against Judge Erlinda Pesta単o-Buted based on multiple unsworn letter-complaints from Gloria Espiritu. The charges broadly allege misconduct, abuse of authority, and impropriety.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **Allegations in First Complaint (A.M. No. 00-10-496-RTC):**
    *   Verbal abuse of court personnel.
    *   Using employees for personal errands.
    *   Irregular attendance and prejudiced logging of employee time.
    *   Soliciting favors (cars, accommodations, money) from lawyers, litigants, and employees.
    *   Biased behavior during hearings.
    *   Reliance on staff instead of own study of cases.
    *   Claiming undue influence with the Chief Justice.
    *   Improper handling of arrest warrants despite pending dismissal agreements.
*   **Allegations in Second Complaint (A.M. No. 00-10-496-RTC):**
    *   Soliciting orchids and other gifts from litigants.
    *   Use of court personnel for personal services (driving, cleaning, construction).
    *   Continued use of free accommodations after being asked to leave.
    *   Failure to reschedule cases during leave of absence.
    *   Exploitation of applicants for court positions.
    *   Unnecessary retyping of court orders.
    *   Use of a stenographer as a nursemaid.
    *   Failure to pay for food ordered by employees on her behalf.
    *   Borrowing money from employees.
    *   Inappropriate attire.
    *   Verbal abuse of staff when confronted with complaints.
*   **Allegations in Third Complaint (Adm. Matter RTJ-02-1681):**
    *   Failure to comply with a Supreme Court memorandum to report to Guimba RTC.
    *   Soliciting support from IBP President and other judges to remain at her post.
    *   Irregular hearing schedules.
    *   Reliance on stenographers to draft orders.
    *   Dismissal of an aide for refusing to drive her home.
    *   Harassment of court employees who reported her.

**Investigating Justice's Findings:**

*   The Investigating Justice (CA Justice Mario Guari単a III) found no substantial evidence to support any of the charges.
*   **Allowances from LGUs:**  Found to be permissible under RA 7160 (Local Government Code) and supported by resolutions from the LGUs. The court noted judges could be assigned under RA 7160, and this fell under their sphere of jurisdiction.
*   **Use of Security Guard as Driver:** Not considered an irregularity because the other guards willingly covered his shift. Moreover, Judge Buted was engaging in official business when needing a driver to and from the Supreme Court.
*   **Service Vehicle from Mayor:** No evidence to support this claim.
*   **Stenographers drafting orders** The court accepted this was standard process with final review by the Judge.
*    **On the charge the Judge made her clerk drive her** the court noted that the judge's clerk drove outside of office hours which was his decision, meaning there was no irregularity.
*   **The additional charges** such as making Michelle Supnet work in court without compensation are also addressed, with the court suggesting that a future rule should be considered for trainee's but could not penalize the judge for it.

**Key Legal Principles & Issues:**

*   **Burden of Proof:** The OCA failed to meet the burden of proving the allegations against Judge Buted.
*   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The Court considered evidence outside the initial charges, but ultimately found it insufficient to warrant disciplinary action.
*   **RA 7160 (Local Government Code):**  Relevant to the issue of the legality of judges receiving allowances from LGUs.
*   **Due Process:** The Court emphasized the importance of protecting judges from unfounded accusations that disrupt the administration of justice and the need for documentary support.
*   **Unsworn Statements:** Heavy reliance on unsworn statements was a weakness in the complainant's case.
*   **Hearsay Evidence:** Supnet's accusations were deemed to be hearsay because she was not privy to the statements.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities (Though ultimately resolved in the judge's favor):**

*   **Receipt of allowances from LGUs:** Could be seen as creating a potential conflict of interest, though the court found it permissible under the Local Government Code.
*   **Use of court personnel for personal tasks:** Raises concerns about misuse of government resources, but the court found these situations did not rise to the level of sanctionable misconduct.
*   **Exploitation of trainees:** While not penalized in this case, highlights the need for clear guidelines regarding the use of trainees in government offices.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The ruling cites *Ong v. Rosete* and *De la Cruz v. Bato* regarding the Court's duty to uphold public accountability and protect the innocent from groundless accusations.
*   It also mentions Sarmiento v. Salamat regarding the need to dismiss unfounded suits.
