## Legal Document Summary: *Cajigas v. People*, G.R. No. 156541 (2009)

**Case:** *Luz Cajigas and Larry Cajigas, Petitioners, vs. People of the Philippines and Court of Appeals, Respondents.*

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing CA decision affirming RTC conviction for two counts each of Estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by PD 818.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Estafa under Article 315, 2(d) RPC (as amended by PD 818):** The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Luz Cajigas for two counts of estafa for issuing postdated checks to Daisy Fuentes that were dishonored due to "Account Closed". The elements of estafa under this provision are (1) postdating/issuance of a check, (2) lack of sufficient funds, and (3) damage to the payee, all of which were sufficiently proven against Luz.
*   **Lack of Conspiracy against Larry:** The Supreme Court acquitted Larry Cajigas due to the lack of proof establishing conspiracy with his wife, Luz, beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution failed to prove that Larry was aware that Luz had insufficient funds. The court emphasized that conspiracy must be proven with the same quantum of evidence as the underlying crime, citing *Sim, Jr. v. People* (G.R. No. 159280, 2004). Larry's prior dealings with the complainant, standing alone, do not establish conspiracy.
*   **Penalty:** The court applied the penalty provisions of PD 818, determining the imposable penalties for Luz Cajigas based on the amounts of the dishonored checks in each case.
    *   Crim Case No. 1411 (P33,758.21): Indeterminate penalty of six years and one day of *prision mayor* as minimum to twenty-one years of *reclusion perpetua* as maximum.
    *   Crim Case No. 1412 (P55,000.00): Indeterminate penalty of six years and one day of *prision mayor* as minimum to twenty-three years of *reclusion perpetua* as maximum.
*   **Defense of Replacement Receipt:** The defense presented a replacement receipt as evidence that the checks were replaced; however, the court found the receipt to be insufficient evidence of replacement as the receipt did not clearly and convincingly indicate that the pawn tickets replaced all the bounced postdated checks, because the value, number, and details of the check supposedly being replaced was undetermined and left blank.
*   **Delay in filing case:** The Court of Appeals reasoned that Daisy was justified in filing the criminal cases only after four years from the date of the commission of the crime because she still had to determine the whereabouts of petitioners.
* **Credibility of Witness:** The appellate court found no inconsistencies between Daisy's testimonies during the cross-examination and rebuttal, simply explaining the purpose and the circumstances that led her to sign the replacement receipt and that the discrepancies between the statements in Daisy's affidavit and testimony did not impair her credibility as affidavits are taken *ex parte* and are often incomplete or inaccurate.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Flores*, 426 Phil. 187 (2002): Cited by the Court of Appeals in increasing the penalty imposed on petitioners.
*   *Firaza v. People*, G.R. No. 154721, 2007: Used in determining the elements of estafa and application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.
*   *Sim, Jr. v. People*, G.R. No. 159280, 2004: Emphasized the standard of proof required for establishing conspiracy.
*   *Timbal v. Court of Appeals*, 423 Phil. 617 (2001):  Cited to support the point that mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to establish conspiracy.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the RPC (as amended by PD 818):** The basis for the estafa charges.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 818:** Amended Article 315 of the RPC and sets the penalties for estafa.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 45:** Governs petitions for review.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Circumstantial Evidence for Conspiracy (Overturned):** The lower courts’ reliance on circumstantial evidence to establish Larry’s involvement. The Supreme Court overturned this, finding the evidence insufficient.
*   **Application of PD 818:** The application of PD 818, resulting in potentially lengthy prison sentences for Luz, needs to be carefully considered, particularly the calculation of additional years based on the value of the checks exceeding P22,000.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** The proper application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and determination of the minimum term.
