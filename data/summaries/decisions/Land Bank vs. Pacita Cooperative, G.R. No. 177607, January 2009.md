## Legal Document Summary: LBP vs. Pacita Agricultural Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc.

**Case:** *Land Bank of the Philippines v. Pacita Agricultural Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc.* G.R. No. 177607, January 19, 2009.

**Subject Matter:** Determination of just compensation for land acquired under Presidential Decree No. 27 (PD 27) for agrarian reform purposes, specifically concerning remaining unpaid portions.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Background:** DAR acquired land in 1972 under PD 27 and distributed it to farmer-beneficiaries. LBP paid AAC, the original landowner, for only 2 of 8 parcels. Pacita Agricultural Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc. later purchased the property from AAC and sought payment for the remaining parcels.

*   **Dispute:** LBP offered a valuation based on PD 27 and EO 228 (valuing land at 1972 prices), which the Cooperative rejected, demanding revaluation under RA 6657.

*   **Lower Court (SAC) Decision:** Applied PD 27 and EO 228 formula strictly, with a 6% interest increment compounded annually from 1972.

*   **Court of Appeals Decision (Overturned SAC):** Retroactive application of RA 6657 due to prolonged delay in payment. Held that using 1972 values was unjust and oppressive. Remanded the case to the SAC for recomputation under Sections 16, 17, and 18 of RA 6657.

*   **LBP Arguments:** RA 6657 cannot be applied retroactively, taking occurred in 1972 under PD 27/EO 228, and these laws are not inferior to RA 6657. Relied on *Gabatin v. LBP* (G.R. No. 148223) for time of taking.

*   **Supreme Court Decision:** Affirmed the Court of Appeals.  Held that due to the long delay in payment, applying RA 6657 is more equitable. Cites *Land Bank v. Natividad* (G.R. No. 127198) and *Meneses v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform* (G.R. No. 156304) emphasizing that taking occurs upon payment of just compensation. Therefore, just compensation should be determined based on the property's value at the time of payment, not the time of the initial taking.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   LBP is obligated to pay just compensation for the land. The amount will be determined by the SAC based on RA 6657, considering factors such as the cost of acquisition, current value of like properties, nature, actual use and income.
*   The decision effectively rejects the strict application of PD 27/EO 228 in cases where significant delays in compensation have occurred, potentially increasing LBP's liability.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree No. 27:** Emancipation of tenants; basis for initial land acquisition.
*   **Executive Order No. 228:** Declaring full land ownership to qualified farmer-beneficiaries and determining land valuation under PD 27.
*   **Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):**  Framework for agrarian reform, including land valuation (Sections 16, 17, 18) and suppletory application of PD 27/EO 228 (Section 75).

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Association of Small Landowners vs. DAR:** Constitutionality of agrarian reform.
*   **Gabatin v. Land Bank of the Philippines (G.R. No. 148223):** LBP initially relied on this for the argument that just compensation should be determined based on the value of the property at the time of taking (October 21, 1972). The Supreme Court distinguished this case.
*   **Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad (G.R. No. 127198):** Crucial precedent. Held that seizure occurred upon payment of just compensation, and RA 6657 applies where payment is delayed.
*   **Meneses v. Secretary of Agrarian Reform (G.R. No. 156304):** Affirmed *Natividad*, finding RA 6657 applicable due to delays and inequities.
* **Lubrica v. Land Bank of the Philippines (G.R. No. 170220):** Affirmed *Natividad*.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Increased Compensation Costs:** The application of RA 6657, which considers current land values, may result in significantly higher compensation payments for LBP compared to using the PD 27/EO 228 formula.
*   **Litigation:**  This decision sets a precedent for landowners to challenge valuations based on PD 27/EO 228, particularly in cases with delayed compensation.
*   **Implementation Challenges:** Determining "just compensation" under RA 6657 requires considering multiple factors, potentially leading to disputes and requiring extensive valuation evidence.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **"Time of Taking":** The key point of contention is the definition of "time of taking." While *Gabatin* initially suggested the date of PD 27's effectivity, *Natividad* and subsequent cases shifted the focus to the date of payment, creating potential inconsistency and requiring careful analysis of specific factual scenarios.

**Advice:**

This case signals a significant shift towards valuing land at the time of payment, particularly when delays have occurred. LBP needs to reassess its valuation strategy in similar cases, factoring in current market values and the principles established in *Natividad*. The legal team should carefully review pending cases involving PD 27 lands to determine if they can be favorably re-evaluated under RA 6657.
