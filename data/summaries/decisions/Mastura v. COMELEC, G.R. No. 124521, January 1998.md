## Legal Document Summary: *Mastura v. COMELEC* (G.R. No. 124521)

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus seeking to reverse COMELEC orders related to the 1995 congressional elections for the First District of Maguindanao.

**Key Issue:** Whether COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in annulling the canvass made by the original Municipal Board of Canvassers of Matanog and ordering a recanvass based on the COMELEC copy of the election returns.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court DISMISSED the petition, affirming the COMELEC's Orders.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **COMELEC's Power to Annul Canvass:** COMELEC has the authority to suspend canvassing to investigate discrepancies in election returns and to annul a canvass based on falsified or tampered returns. COMELEC can order a recanvass using genuine returns, replace board members, or proclaim winners itself. *(See Agpalo, Comments on the Omnibus Election Code; Aratuc v. COMELEC; Lucman v. Dimaporo; Abes v. COMELEC)*.
*   **Recanvass Procedure:** COMELEC ordered a recanvass using the COMELEC copy of the election returns after determining the original Certificate of Canvass was tampered. A new Municipal and Provincial Board of Canvassers was constituted for the recanvass.
*   **Status of Election Return Copies:** All seven copies of the election returns (including those distributed to the Municipal Board of Canvassers, Congress, COMELEC, Provincial Board of Canvassers, the municipal treasurer, and the municipal trial court judge) are original copies, not just the one designated to the Municipal Board.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Mastura's Loss:** Mastura's challenge to the COMELEC's actions failed, resulting in Dilangalen's proclamation as the duly elected representative.
*   **Lack of Grave Abuse of Discretion:** The Court found no grave abuse of discretion by COMELEC, deferring to its factual finding of tampering and its broad powers to ascertain election results.
*   **Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies:** The Court noted that Mastura should have sought recourse from the COMELEC *en banc* before appealing to the Supreme Court after the denial of his motion for reconsideration, pursuant to Sec. 3, Art. IX-C, of the Constitution.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Sec. 3, Art. IX-C of the Constitution:** Requires recourse to COMELEC *en banc* before appealing to the SC.
*   **R.A. No. 7166 (The Synchronized Elections and Electoral Reforms Law of 1991):**
    *   **Sec. 27:**  Outlines the number of copies of election returns and their distribution.
    *   **Sec. 28:**  Defines the canvassing procedures for provincial, city, district, and municipal boards of canvassers.
    *   **Sec. 29:**  Outlines the number of copies of the certificate of canvass and their distribution.
    *   **Sec. 15:** Pre-proclamation cases not allowed, but COMELEC may correct "manifest errors".
*   **Aratuc v. COMELEC (L-49705-06):** Affirms COMELEC's plenary power of direct control and supervision over boards of canvassers.
*   **Lucman v. Dimaporo (L-31558):** Defines the ministerial function of canvassing boards and COMELEC's supervisory power.
*   **Abes v. COMELEC (L-28348):** Emphasizes that a board of canvassers is a ministerial body and limits its powers during canvassing.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points of Law:**

*   **"Manifest Errors" and COMELEC Discretion:** While R.A. 7166 Sec. 15 allows COMELEC to correct "manifest errors," the Court has granted COMELEC broad discretion in determining the appropriate remedy when faced with evidence of tampering, including using the COMELEC copy for recanvassing. The definition of "manifest error" is not expressly defined and could be challenged in future cases with unique circumstances.
*   **Weight Given to Different Copies of Election Returns:** The petitioner tried to argue that the Municipal Board of Canvasser copy was the "original." While this was refuted, the court did not explicitly state a hierarchy of copies, only clarifying they are all "original." A future case might challenge which copy should be preferred in the event of a discrepancy where tampering is not confirmed.

**Overall Assessment:** The decision reinforces COMELEC's broad administrative powers in overseeing elections and correcting irregularities. The emphasis on COMELEC's discretion, particularly in the absence of demonstrable grave abuse, limits the scope for judicial intervention in election disputes.
