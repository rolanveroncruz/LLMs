## Legal Document Summary: Robustum Agricultural Corporation v. DAR and LBP

**Case:** Robustum Agricultural Corporation vs. Department of Agrarian Reform and Land Bank of the Philippines (G.R. No. 221484, November 19, 2018)

**Subject Matter:** Appeal of RTC Order dismissing a petition for quieting of title and declaratory relief challenging the efficacy of a Notice of Coverage (NOC) issued by DAR under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **RA No. 6657 (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law):** Establishes the legal framework for agrarian reform, including land acquisition and distribution. Section 50 vests DAR with primary jurisdiction over agrarian reform matters.
*   **RA No. 9700 (CARPER Extension Act):** Amended RA No. 6657, extending the period for land acquisition and distribution to June 30, 2014 (Section 5). Section 30 allows pending cases/proceedings involving the implementation of RA No. 6657 as of June 30, 2014, to proceed to finality even beyond that date.
*   **DAR AO No. 07-11 (2011 Revised Rules and Procedure):** Governs the acquisition and distribution of private agricultural lands under RA No. 6657. Sets forth procedures for issuance and service of NOC.
*   **DAR AO No. 03-17 (2017 Rules for ALI Cases):** Establishes rules for Agrarian Law Implementation (ALI) cases and provides remedies such as "petition to lift notice of coverage"

**Facts:**

*   Robustum Agricultural Corporation (RAC) owns a 5-hectare parcel, previously part of a 30-hectare estate owned by Puyas Agro Inc. (PAI), RAC's predecessor.
*   DAR issued a Notice of Coverage (NOC) to PAI. DAR then issued a letter to Robustum indicating its inclusion as a potential landowner/payee for the estate compensation.
*   RAC refused to receive the letter and attached NOC.
*   DAR published a NOC in the Philippine Star.
*   RAC filed a petition for quieting of title and declaratory relief in the RTC, questioning the efficacy of the NOC, arguing improper service and non-compliance with posting requirements under DAR AO No. 07-11.

**Court's Ruling:**

*   The Supreme Court (SC) upheld the RTC's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.
*   The SC clarified that Section 30 of RA No. 9700 only authorized DAR to continue pending cases/proceedings as of June 30, 2014 and did not vest jurisdiction on regular courts for cases filed after that date.
*   The SC held that the issuance of the NOC pertaining to the mother estate and the subject land prior to June 30, 2014, initiated a proceeding for compulsory land acquisition.
*   The SC reasoned that DAR's authority under Section 30 necessarily includes the authority to exercise its quasi-judicial powers under Section 50 of RA No. 6657 concerning any agrarian reform controversy arising from such proceeding.
*   SC held that challenges to the efficacy of a NOC constitutes a matter involving the implementation of agrarian reform and within DAR's exclusive original jurisdiction.
*   The SC noted that the proper remedy for Robustum was a "petition to lift notice of coverage" with the DAR Municipal Office (DARMO), pursuant to DAR AO No. 03-17.

**Liabilities:**

*   RAC risks compulsory acquisition of its land under CARP if DAR follows procedures and determines the land is covered.
*   RAC could face challenges in securing just compensation if it fails to engage effectively in the valuation process with LBP.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Pursuing the case in the wrong forum (RTC) can lead to dismissal and delay.
*   **Compliance with DAR Procedures:** Failure to comply with DAR regulations on filing protests, providing information, and participating in hearings can prejudice RAC's position.
*   **Valuation Disputes:** Disagreement with LBP's valuation of the property and challenges to the amount of just compensation.
*   **Loss of Land:** Ultimate risk is the compulsory acquisition and redistribution of the land to qualified beneficiaries.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *Department of Agrarian Reform v. Cuenca, 482 Phil. 208 (2004)*: Confirms the DAR's exclusive original jurisdiction over issues pertaining to the propriety of a notice of coverage.
*   *Roxas & Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 378 Phil. 727 (1999)*: Discusses the genesis of the NOC and the identification process in compulsory land acquisition.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 6657, as amended (Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law)
*   Republic Act No. 9700 (CARPER Extension Act)

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of "pending" cases/proceedings under Section 30 of RA No. 9700. The SC's decision clarifies that the issuance of NOC before the deadline is sufficient to consider the proceeding as pending.
*   The scope of DAR's quasi-judicial powers under Section 50 of RA No. 6657 in relation to Section 30 of RA No. 9700.

**Legal Advice:**

RAC should immediately file a "petition to lift notice of coverage" with the relevant DARMO as per DAR AO No. 03-17. Engage legal counsel with expertise in agrarian law to navigate DAR proceedings, ensure compliance with regulations, and protect RAC's rights throughout the compulsory land acquisition process. Closely monitor the valuation process and prepare to contest any inadequate just compensation offers through proper channels, potentially including judicial action for final determination of just compensation.
