**Summary of *PSP Development Corporation v. Atty. Arma*, A.C. No. 12220 (2018)**

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Atty. Luisito C. Arma for alleged serious misconduct and violation of the Lawyer's Oath.

**Facts:** PSP Development Corporation (PSP), represented by Reynaldo Pasco, filed a complaint alleging that it engaged Atty. Arma to file a case in 2004 against Pio Castillo, Jr., and Macatan Apparel, Inc., paid him P65,000.00 in professional fees, but Atty. Arma failed to file the case despite repeated follow-ups. A demand for return of the money was allegedly ignored.

**IBP Recommendation:** The IBP Investigating Commissioner initially recommended a 5-year suspension, which the IBP Board of Governors modified to a 2-year suspension.  The IBP’s findings were based solely on the Complaint, as Atty. Arma failed to file an answer, and the complainant failed to follow up on the case. There was no record of any mandatory conference, order to submit position papers, or submission of evidence ex parte by the complainant despite the respondent’s default.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Lawyer's Oath:** Implicit obligation to diligently pursue client's cases.
*   **Due Process:** Requirement of affording the respondent an opportunity to be heard, even in default, and for disciplinary actions to be based on established facts and applicable law.  See *Cojuangco, Jr. v. Palma*, 501 Phil. 1 (2005) and *Paredes v. Verano*, 535 Phil. 274 (2006).

**Liabilities/Potential Risks:**

*   **Disciplinary Action:** Suspension or disbarment for misconduct (potential liability).
*   **Reputation Damage:** Negative publicity associated with disciplinary proceedings.
*   **Financial Loss:** Restitution of fees if misconduct is proven (though not ordered in this case).

**Court's Ruling:** The Supreme Court *dismissed* the complaint against Atty. Arma for lack of evidence and violation of due process. The Court held that the allegations in the Complaint were unsubstantiated. Other than a photocopy of a demand letter, there was no evidence presented that Atty. Arma accepted the money and failed to render services.  The Court emphasized the high burden of proof required in disciplinary cases. Citing *Arsenio v. Tabuzo, A.C. No. 8658, April 24, 2017, 824 SCRA 45, 49-50* the court emphasizes on the burden of proof needed to find a lawyer at fault. Citing *JMM Promotion and Management, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 329 Phil. 87, 99-100 (1996)*, the right to work is emphasized and may not be taken.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   The record indicates that Atty. Arma was in default because he failed to file an answer, but the Court highlighted the fact that the IBP did not actually issue an order of default, and the complainant did not present evidence *ex parte.*
*   The Court faulted the IBP for failing to conduct proper proceedings, including holding mandatory conferences and soliciting position papers.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Philippine Constitution, Article III, Section 1:** Due process clause.
*   **Cojuangco, Jr. v. Palma, 501 Phil. 1 (2005):** Due process in administrative proceedings.
*    **Paredes v. Verano, 535 Phil. 274 (2006):** Due process of law.
*   **Arsenio v. Tabuzo, A.C. No. 8658, April 24, 2017, 824 SCRA 45, 49-50:** Rules on evidence.
*   **JMM Promotion and Management, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 329 Phil. 87, 99-100 (1996):** Rules on the right to work.

**Potential Risks:**

*   The case highlights the risk of disciplinary action for attorneys who fail to adequately represent their clients or who allegedly misappropriate fees.
*   It also underscores the importance of procedural due process in administrative proceedings and the need for complainants to present substantial evidence to support their claims. The case may also be a cause of concern for lawyers if one is judged to be at fault in a case without substantial evidence.
