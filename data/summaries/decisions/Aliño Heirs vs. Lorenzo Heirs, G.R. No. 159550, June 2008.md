## Legal Document Summary - *Lucia Carlos Ali単o vs. Heirs of Angelica A. Lorenzo* (G.R. No. 159550)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming the dismissal of a complaint for declaration of nullity of a Deed of Absolute Sale, annulment of extra-judicial settlement, reconveyance, and damages.

**Core Issue:** Validity of a Deed of Absolute Sale between Lucia Ali単o (petitioner, now substituted by heirs) and her daughter Angelica Lorenzo (deceased, represented by heirs).

**Key Provisions/Facts:**

*   **Deed of Absolute Sale:** Executed in 1979, transferring a 1,745 sq. m. property from Lucia to Angelica for P10,000.
*   **Title Transfer:** TCT transferred to Angelica's name.
*   **Lucia's Continued Actions:**
    *   Continued paying real property taxes (1980-1987).
    *   Designated a caretaker, Vivian Losaria, who built a house and resided on the property, delivering fruits from the property to Lucia.
    *   Offered the property for sale (including the subject lot) to the Central Bank of the Philippines.
    *   Later demanded the return of the property from Angelica's heirs in 1989.
*   **Angelica's/Heirs' Actions:**
    *   Extra-Judicial Settlement executed by Angelica's heirs, adjudicating the property to her minor children.
    *   Delayed tax payments by Servillano, Sr. after the complaint was filed.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA decision, and declared the Deed of Absolute Sale NULL and VOID *ab initio*. Ordered the heirs to reconvey the property to Lucia's heirs.

**Key Rationale:**

*   **Simulation (Absolute):** The Court found the sale to be simulated. Cited *Suntay v. Court of Appeals* (321 Phil. 809 (1995)) and subsequent jurisprudence emphasizing the *absence of an attempt by the vendee to assert ownership rights* as a key indicator of simulation.
*   **Lack of Dominion by Vendee:** Angelica and her heirs *never exercised acts of dominion* over the property.
*   **Continuous Possession by Vendor:** Lucia remained in *actual possession* of the property through her caretaker, establishing acts of dominion (Reyes v. Court of Appeals, 374 Phil. 236, 242-243 (1999)).
*   **Tax Payments:** Lucia's payment of real property taxes, combined with actual possession, indicated a claim of ownership (Republic v. Candy Maker, Inc., G.R. No. 163766, June 22, 2006, 492 SCRA 272, 296)

**Liabilities/Obligations:**

*   Heirs of Angelica Lorenzo are obligated to reconvey the property to the heirs of Lucia Ali単o.
*   Register of Deeds is obligated to cancel TCT No. T-24417 and issue a new TCT in the name of Lucia Ali単o's heirs upon presentation of the Deed of Reconveyance.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **Statute of Limitations:** While an action for reconveyance typically prescribes in 10 years, the Court held that *the right to seek reconveyance does not prescribe when the claimant is in actual possession* (citing *Aznar Brothers Realty Company v. Aying*, G.R. No. 144773, May 16, 2005, 458 SCRA 496, 510).
*   **Consideration:** The Court mentioned inadequacy or non-payment of price is inconsistent with the concept of simulation. The argument of consideration may have been strengthened if the Petitioner provided proof of complete failure to pay the promised amount.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Civil Code Articles 1345, 1370, 1371:**  Regarding simulation of contracts and interpretation of contracts.
*   **Rule 45 of the Rules of Court:** Basis for the Petition for Review on Certiorari.
*   **Suntay v. Court of Appeals** (321 Phil. 809):  Landmark case on simulation.
*   **Reyes v. Court of Appeals** (374 Phil. 236):  Definition of actual possession.
*   **Republic v. Candy Maker, Inc.** (G.R. No. 163766, June 22, 2006): Evidentiary weight of tax declarations and receipts.
*   **Aznar Brothers Realty Company v. Aying** (G.R. No. 144773, May 16, 2005): Non-prescription of action for reconveyance in cases of actual possession.
