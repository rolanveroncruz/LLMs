## Legal Document Summary - *Atty. George S. Briones v. Lilia J. Henson-Cruz, et al.* (G.R. No. 159130)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals decision granting a Petition for Mandamus compelling the RTC to give due course to an appeal.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Appointment of Special Administrator:** Atty. Briones was appointed Special Administrator of the Estate of Luz J. Henson in Sp. Proc. No. 99-92870.
*   **Administrator's Fees:** Trial court initially approved monthly fees of P60,000 for Atty. Briones.
*   **Final Report & Commission Claim:** Atty. Briones submitted a final report and claimed an 8% commission (P97,850,191.26) based on the value of the estate.
*   **Order of April 3, 2002:** The RTC issued an Order covering the appointment of an auditor (Alba, Romeo & Co.) for Atty. Brionesâ€™ final report and the payment of his commission, fixed at 1.8% of the estate's value. It also directed the Special Administrator to deliver the residue of the estate to the heirs in proportion to their shares.
*   **Multiple Appeals:** The respondents filed both an appeal regarding the commission and a Petition for Certiorari (CA-G.R. SP No. 70349) challenging the auditor's appointment. The RTC initially dismissed the appeal for forum shopping. The CA sided with the heirs and ultimately commanded the lower court to allow cross examination of Atty. Briones, before finally approving the Special Administrator's Final Report.

**Obligations:**

*   **Atty. Briones:** Administration of estate assets, submission of reports, delivery of the estate residue.  Obligation to undergo scrutiny by independent auditors and potentially be cross-examined.
*   **Heirs:** To turn over estate properties to the Special Administrator.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Atty. Briones:** Potential for reduced commission compared to his initial claim.  Exposure to audit findings that could impact his fees or require him to account for discrepancies.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Forum Shopping:**  Petitioner's main argument is that the respondents engaged in forum shopping by pursuing both an appeal and a petition for certiorari from the same RTC order.  If successful, the CA's order to give due course to the appeal could be reversed.
*   **Audit Outcomes:** The audit could reveal mismanagement of funds or other issues affecting the value of the estate, potentially leading to further legal action or reducing Atty. Briones' fees.
*   **Delayed Settlement:** Continued litigation delays the final settlement and distribution of the estate, potentially increasing costs.

*   **Gatmaytan v. Court of Appeals (G. R. No. 123332), Section 5, Rule 7, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Forum Shopping elements.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The central contention revolves around the interpretation of the Order of April 3, 2002 and whether pursuing separate remedies (appeal and certiorari) for different aspects of the order constitutes impermissible forum shopping. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the CA and found the petition devoid of merit.
