## Legal Document Summary: G.R. No. 160236 ("G" Holdings, Inc. vs. NAMAWU)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Review on Certiorari)

**Case Summary:** This case concerns a dispute between "G" Holdings, Inc. (GHI) and the National Mines and Allied Workers Union Local 103 (NAMAWU) regarding the enforcement of a labor judgment against Maricalum Mining Corporation (MMC). NAMAWU sought to execute on MMC's assets to satisfy a labor judgment, but GHI claimed a prior mortgage lien on those assets, preventing execution.  The central legal question is whether the RTC correctly issued an injunction to stop the execution, which hinged on the validity of GHI's mortgage claim and whether the corporate veil between GHI and MMC should be pierced.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA):** GHI purchased 90% of MMC's shares and financial claims (promissory notes) from Asset Privatization Trust (APT). The PSA is the basis of GHI's standing.
*   **Promissory Notes (1992):** MMC issued promissory notes to GHI totaling P500M, secured by mortgages over MMC's properties. These notes constitute the original mortgage and evidence of GHI's lien. They establish a priority claim against MMC's assets.
*   **Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage (1996):** A formal document reiterating the mortgage established in the 1992 promissory notes. NAMAWU argues this was executed fraudulently to evade labor obligations.
*   **Quisumbing Order:** DOLE Secretary ordered MMC to reinstate laid-off workers with backwages and benefits due to unfair labor practices (ULP). This order established NAMAWU's claim against MMC.
*   **Brion Writ & Sto. Tomas Writ:** DOLE-issued writs of execution to enforce the Quisumbing Order. These writs led to the attempted levy on MMC's assets, triggering the dispute with GHI.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **MMC's Liability to NAMAWU:** MMC remains liable for the labor judgment, creating an ongoing obligation to the union.
*   **GHI's Risk of Subordinated Claim:** If the mortgage is deemed invalid, GHI's claim would be subordinated to NAMAWU's labor judgment. This risk is mitigated by the Court's validation of the mortgage.
*   **NAMAWU's Risk of Uncollectible Judgment:** If MMC's assets are insufficient to satisfy the labor judgment after GHI's mortgage is satisfied, NAMAWU faces the risk of an uncollectible judgment.

**Key Legal Issues & Case Law:**

*   **Validity of the Mortgage:** NAMAWU argued the mortgage was a sham, fictitious, and fraudulent, designed to defeat their labor claims. The court rejects this argument.
*   **Third-Party Claim to Execution:** GHI claimed the levied properties were subject to a prior mortgage, rendering them exempt from execution for MMC's debt. This is the core issue that determines the propriety of the injunction. *National Mines and Allied Workers' Union v. Vera* (L-44230, November 19, 1984, 133 SCRA 259, 269-270) provides a strong framework for resolution of claims.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** NAMAWU argued the corporate veil between GHI and MMC should be pierced, making GHI liable for MMC's debts. The court rejects this argument.
*   **Judicial Notice:** The court took judicial notice of *Republic of the Philippines v. "G" Holdings, Inc.* (G.R. No. 141241, November 22, 2005, 475 SCRA 608), which recognized GHI's right to MMC's shares and financial notes. This is crucial for establishing GHI's legitimate interest.
*   ***MR Holdings, Ltd. v. Sheriff Bajar*:** (430 Phil. 443, 467-469 (2002)). Provides guiding prinicples for conveyances and fraudulent intent of debtors.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Rules of Court, Rule 39:** governs execution of judgments and third-party claims.
*   **Civil Code, Art. 1387 & 1381:** Addresses presumptions of fraud and conveyances to avoid judgement.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1529, Section 51 & 52:** Governs property registration under the Torrens system and its effect on third parties.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Mortgage Registration:** The delayed registration of the mortgage deed (executed in 1996, registered in 2000) raised suspicion but was ultimately deemed acceptable by the court. The date of foreclosure and attempted attachment also caused concern for its potential to act as a fraudulent act in avoidance of judgement.

**Court's Holding:**

The Supreme Court GRANTED GHI's petition. The Court of Appeals' decision was SET ASIDE, and the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) Omnibus Order was AFFIRMED. The injunction preventing the enforcement of the Sto. Tomas Writ was upheld.

**Rationale:**

*   The mortgage was valid and not a sham, as it originated from a legitimate transaction with the government (APT) and predated the labor dispute.
*   The late registration of the mortgage did not invalidate it, as GHI's mortgage rights were superior to those of a subsequent attaching creditor.
*   Piercing the corporate veil was not justified, as there was no evidence of fraud or abuse by GHI in its relationship with MMC.
*   The RTC properly issued the injunction to protect GHI's property rights as a third-party claimant.

**Potential Next Steps:**

*   NAMAWU's options are limited within this case. They can pursue other remedies against MMC under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, such as examining the judgment debtor or its obligors, or seeking receivership. This case concludes, by all practical measures, that GHI owns and can maintain its right to the disputed assets.
