**Legal Document Summary: A.M. NO. P-07-2298 and A.M. NO. P-07-2299**

This document consolidates two administrative cases against Marites R. Manio, a Court Interpreter III, for dishonesty and grave misconduct.

**A.M. NO. P-07-2298 (Mallonga Complaint):** Manio allegedly misrepresented her ability to expedite a correction of entry in Mallonga's marriage certificate, solicited P13,000 in fees, provided a spurious resolution purportedly signed by Judge Abella-Aquino, and claimed influence within the court. This resolution contained a docket number belonging to a different case.

**A.M. NO. P-07-2299 (Bartolome Complaint):** Manio allegedly solicited P15,000 (plus an additional P500) from Bartolome, sister of a litigant, for a guaranteed favorable decision in a correction of entries case. She provided a fake resolution purportedly signed by Judge Abella-Aquino, and claimed influence for the dismissal and refiling of the case. This resolution also contained a docket number belonging to a different case, and the court had no record of the case.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Dishonesty & Grave Misconduct:** The Court found Manio guilty of both based on the unrebutted affidavits, the fabricated resolutions, and Manio's failure to respond to the charges.
*   **Forgery:** The Court highlights the significance of forging the presiding judge's signature as a significant breach of trust and integrity.
*   **Breach of Public Trust:** The court emphasizes that employees of the judiciary should be acting at all times with integrity.
*   **Prior Dismissal:** Manio was previously dismissed in **A.M. No. P-07-2397 (Canlas-Bartolome v. Manio, 539 SCRA 333)** for similar conduct related to the Bartolome complaint. This rendered A.M. No. P-07-2299 moot.
*   **Penalty in A.M. No. P-07-2298:** Because Manio was already dismissed, the Court imposed a fine of P40,000, to be deducted from her accrued leave benefits, instead of dismissal.

**Statutory & Case Law References:**

*   **Sections 52 and 58 of Rule IV of the Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 19-99:** Penalties for Dishonesty and Grave Misconduct (Dismissal).
*   **Ca√±ada v. Suerte, A.M. No. RTJ-04-1884, February 22, 2008, 546 SCRA 414, 424:** Defines "dishonesty."
*   **Faeldonea v. CSC, G.R. No. 143474, August 6, 2002, 386 SCRA 384, 388:** Defines "grave misconduct."
*   **Ortiz v. De Guzman, A.M. No. P-03-1708, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 392, 399:** References inference of guilt based on failure to respond to accusations.
*   **OCA v. Cunting, A.M. No. P-04-1917, December 10, 2007, 539 SCRA 494, 511-512:** Precedent for imposing a fine instead of dismissal when the respondent has already been dismissed.
*   **Canlas-Bartolome v. Manio, 539 SCRA 333:** Prior decision dismissing Manio for similar conduct related to the Bartolome complaint.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Reliance on Unrebutted Affidavits:** The Court heavily relies on the affidavits of Mallonga and Bartolome. While Manio's silence is noted, the case's strength depends on the credibility of these affidavits.
*   **Criminal Prosecution:** The OCA is directed to file criminal charges. The success of these charges will depend on the available evidence and the applicable criminal statutes (e.g., estafa, forgery).

**Summary of Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Marites R. Manio:** Guilty of dishonesty and grave misconduct. Liable for a P40,000 fine to be deducted from accrued leave benefits. Subject to potential criminal prosecution.
*   **OCA:** Obligated to file appropriate criminal charges against Manio.
