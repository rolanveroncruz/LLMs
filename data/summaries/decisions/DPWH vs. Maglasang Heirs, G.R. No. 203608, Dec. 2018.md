## Legal Document Summary: Republic v. Heirs of Maglasang (G.R. No. 203608)

**Type:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision affirming RTC decision in expropriation case.

**Key Issue:** Propriety of RTC taking judicial notice of a related case (Republic v. Larrazabal) to determine just compensation.

**Holding:** Supreme Court GRANTS the petition, SETS ASIDE the CA decision. Held that the RTC improperly relied on the *Larrazabal* case.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Expropriation:** DPWH filed a complaint to expropriate land owned by Spouses Maglasang for a flood mitigation project.
*   **Just Compensation:** The central dispute concerns the amount of just compensation to be paid for the land.
*   **Rule 67, Section 3 (Revised Rules of Court):**  Allows defendants, even those who haven't formally appeared, to present evidence on the amount of compensation. However the RTC took undue notice of the Larrazabal case.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Government (DPWH):** Obligation to pay just compensation for the expropriated land. Risk of increased compensation due to incorrect valuation methodology by lower courts.
*   **Heirs of Maglasang:** Risk of receiving lower compensation due to the Supreme Court's rejection of the higher valuation from the *Larrazabal* case and reliance on the Ormoc City Assessor's valuation.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:** Basis for the Petition for Review.
*   **Rule 67, Section 3, Revised Rules of Court:** Dictates the procedure for presenting evidence on just compensation in expropriation cases.
*   **Republic v. Larrazabal:** Related case concerning contiguous land, improperly used by the RTC.
*   **Sec. of the DPWH, et al., v. Sps. Tecson, 713 Phil. 55, 73 (2013):** Reiterated principle that just compensation should be based on the value of the land *at the time of taking* or the filing of the complaint, not at the time of judgment.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses & Points:**

*   **Due Process:**  The Supreme Court notes a "gray area" regarding whether the DPWH was afforded due process in the RTC proceedings.
*   **Contiguity & Land Classification:**  The court found that the RTC failed to properly prove that the subject land was contiguous to the *Larrazabal* property or that the land classifications were equivalent, undermining the justification for applying the *Larrazabal* valuation.
*   **Valuation Discrepancy:**  Significant difference between the Ormoc City Assessor's valuation (P1,000/sqm) and the RTC's valuation based on the *Larrazabal* case (P17,000/sqm).

**Key Takeaway:** The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of proper evidence presentation and adherence to established valuation principles in expropriation cases, rejecting the shortcut of applying a similar case's valuation without adequately proving the comparability of the properties. The valuation should be based on the assessor's value.
