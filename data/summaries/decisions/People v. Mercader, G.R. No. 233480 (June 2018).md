## Legal Document Summary - *People v. Mercader*, G.R. No. 233480 (2018)

**Nature:** Decision on appeal from a CA decision affirming RTC conviction for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale) and 11 (Illegal Possession) of R.A. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act).

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *reversed* the CA decision and acquitted Mercader.

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The central issue is the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody for the seized *shabu*, which is a *corpus delicti* element. Specifically, the Court focuses on violations of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165, before its amendment by RA 10640.
*   **Section 21 Violation:** The Court notes the following deviations:
    *   Absence of required witnesses (elected public official, DOJ representative, and media representative) during the marking of the seized items. No justifiable reason was offered for their absence.
    *   Failure to conduct physical inventory and photograph the seized items as required by law.
*   **Lack of Justifiable Ground:** The prosecution failed to provide any *justifiable ground* for the non-compliance with the procedures outlined in Section 21, as required by the IRR of RA 9165. This is despite conflicting statements of the police officers.

**Legal Reasoning and Case Law:**

*   **Strict Compliance with Sec. 21:** The Court reiterates that Section 21 is a matter of substantive law and strict compliance is required to ensure the integrity of the confiscated drug. Failure to comply indicates the absence of a *corpus delicti* element.
*   **Burden of Proof on Prosecution:** The prosecution has the *positive duty* to prove compliance with Section 21 and justify any deviations. The Court is empowered to examine the records to ascertain full compliance, even if the issue wasn't raised below. *People v. Miranda, G.R. No. 229671, January 31, 2018.*
*   **Presumption of Regularity Overcome:** Reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is *fundamentally flawed* when there are lapses in procedures. The prosecution's burden to prove compliance with Section 21 supersedes this presumption when there is a clear disregard for the law.
*   **Case Law Citations:** The decision relies heavily on *People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014)* emphasizing the importance of witness presence to prevent evidence tampering. Also, *People v. Almorfe, 631 Phil. 51 (2010)* and *People v. De Guzman, 630 Phil. 637 (2010)* are cited to underscore the requirement of proving justifiable grounds for non-compliance as a *fact*.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Lack of Justification Standard:** The decision reinforces the high bar for justifying deviations from Section 21. The court requires demonstrable evidence of reasonable steps taken to comply with Section 21 and a clear explanation for any failures.
*   **Impact of RA 10640:** The court acknowledges but does not directly address the impact of RA 10640 (amending Section 21), as the crime occurred prior to its enactment.  The concurring opinion of Justice Peralta highlights the issues which spurred the enactment of RA 10640.
*   **Evidence Planting Risk:** Despite the conviction being overturned on chain of custody grounds, the decision implicitly raises concerns regarding potential evidence planting by law enforcement.

**Conclusion:**

This case underscores the criticality of strict adherence to the chain of custody rule under R.A. 9165 and related jurisprudence. The Court's decision emphasizes the government's burden to prove compliance with Section 21 beyond a reasonable doubt and justify *any* deviation from the established procedures. Failure to do so will result in the acquittal of the accused, regardless of the evidence presented. The Court's stance aims to safeguard individual liberties and prevent abuses within drug enforcement operations.
