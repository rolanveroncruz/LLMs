## Legal Document Summary - *Fermin v. COMELEC* (G.R. Nos. 179695 & 182369)

**Core Issue:** This consolidated case clarifies the distinction between a petition for disqualification under Sec. 68 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) and a petition to deny due course to or cancel a Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) under Sec. 78 of the OEC. It also addresses residency requirements for mayoral candidates.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Sec. 78 vs. Sec. 68 OEC:** The Court holds that private respondent Dilangalen's petition against Fermin was, in substance, a Sec. 78 petition (denial of due course to CoC) based on Fermin's alleged false representation regarding residency in his CoC. The Court emphasized that this is distinct from a disqualification petition under Sec. 68 (disqualification based on prohibited acts, foreign residency, etc.).
    *   *Case Law:** *Miranda v. Abaya* distinguishes the consequences of disqualification under Sec. 68 vs. cancellation under Sec. 78, particularly regarding substitution.
*   **Timeliness of the Petition:** The Court clarifies that Sec. 78 petitions must be filed within 25 days from the filing of the CoC. While the law stands, it invalidates Rule 23, Section 2 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure which states that "The petition must be filed within five (5) days following the last day for the filing of certificates of candidacy."
    *   *Statutory References:** Sec. 78 OEC, R.A. 6646 Sections 5 and 7.
    *   *Case Law:** *Aznar v. COMELEC* and *Loong v. COMELEC* affirm the 25-day period.
*   **Residency Requirement:** The COMELEC's ruling disqualifying Fermin for lack of residency was overturned. The Court found that COMELEC relied too heavily on a single piece of evidence (oath of office) without considering the possibility that Fermin could have changed his residence after the date stated in the oath.
    *   *Statutory References:** Sec. 39 of the Local Government Code (LGC) and Section 9 of Republic Act No. 8189 or "The Voter's Registration Act of 1996." establishes qualifications for elected local officials, including residency requirements.
*   **COMELEC Jurisdiction:** The Court finds that in this case, the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion by issuing an order for dismissal based on Fermin's supposed lack of legal standing to file the protest since it was based on the COMELEC's finding that Fermin did not meet the residency requirements and was thus, unqualified.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Candidate Obligations:** Candidates have a duty to make truthful representations in their CoCs. False statements regarding material facts, such as residency, can lead to denial of due course to their CoCs.
*   **COMELEC Obligations:** The COMELEC has a duty to correctly classify petitions (Sec. 68 vs. Sec. 78), apply the correct timeframes, and to consider all available evidence before making determinations about a candidate's qualifications. They should comply with the provisions of law and not supplanted by a COMELEC rule or resolution.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Applying Residency Requirements:** The decision highlights the importance of meticulously examining evidence related to residency. Relying on single pieces of potentially outdated information can lead to erroneous disqualifications.
*   **COMELEC Rulemaking Power**: The assimilation in Rule 25 of the COMELEC rules of grounds for ineligibility into grounds for disqualification is contrary to the evident intention of the law, especially in instances of setting timeframes.

**Outcome:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petitions, annulling and setting aside the COMELEC's rulings. This suggests Fermin was entitled to have his candidacy and election protest re-evaluated based on a proper consideration of the evidence.
