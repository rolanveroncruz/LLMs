**Legal Document Summary: *Development Bank of the Philippines vs. Commission on Audit***

**Case:** G.R. No. 262193, February 6, 2024 (Resolution on Motion for Partial Reconsideration)

**Parties:**
*   **Petitioner:** Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
*   **Respondent:** Commission on Audit (COA)

**Subject Matter:** Disallowance of the payment of Money Value of Leave Credits (MVLC) to DBP officials and employees, computed based on "gross monthly cash compensation," disallowed by the COA.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **DBP Circular No. 10 (2005):** Authorized the computation of MVLC based on "gross monthly cash compensation." This is the primary source of the controversy.
*   **COA Disallowances (NDs):** Notices of Disallowance were issued by the COA asserting that MVLC should be based on basic pay only.
*   **DBP's Revised Charter, Section 13:** DBP initially relied on this section, arguing their power to fix personnel compensation. This was later dismissed due to COA's violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Presidential Approval (PGMA):** DBP attempted to validate Circular No. 10 with a post-facto approval from then President Arroyo, which was deemed invalid by the COA and the Supreme Court.
*   **Right to Speedy Disposition:** COA failed to resolve the case for 11 years violating DBP's constitutional right.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Initially:** The COA sought to hold DBP's Board of Directors (BOD) and approving officers liable for the disallowed amounts. Passive recipients were also held liable in a subsequent decision.
*   **Ultimately:** Due to the inordinate delay by the COA, the Supreme Court absolved DBP and its officials and employees from any liability for the disallowed amounts.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Omnibus Election Code (OEC):** Referenced in the Supreme Court’s finding that President Arroyo's approval was invalid due to being granted within the prohibited period before an election.
*   **Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1597:** Requires presidential review (through the DBM) of compensation plans for agencies exempt from the Office of Compensation and Position Classification.
*   **Memorandum Order (MO) No. 20:** Requires presidential approval for any salary increase of GOCCs and GFIs not in accordance with the Salary Standardization Law.
*   **DBM Budget Circular (BC) No. 2002-1:** States that MLC shall be computed in accordance with the formula used in the computation of Terminal Leave Benefits (TLB).
*   **Civil Service Commission (CSC) MC No. 14-99 and CSC MC No. 8-03:** Used "monthly salary" as basis for TLB, which case law defines as basic salary.
*   **Section 16, Article III of the Constitution:** Guarantees the right to speedy disposition of cases.
*   **Section 7, Article IX(A), of the Constitution:** Requires COA to decide cases within 60 days.
*   **Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, Section 261(g)(2):** Grant of increase of salary or remuneration or privilege to any government official or employee is prohibited during the period of 45 days before a regular election.

**Case Law:**

*   ***Navarro v. Commission on Audit* (2019):** Inordinate delay by the COA was grounds for reversing the COA's decision.
*   ***Rosario v. Commission on Audit* (2021):** Similar to *Navarro*, delay was grounds for reversal and relieving liability.
*   ***Development Bank of the Philippines v. Commission on Audit* (2022):** (GR Nos. 210965 & 217623) Held that PGMA's approval of DBP's compensation plan was void due to being issued during the prohibited period under the Omnibus Election Code.
*   ***Madera v. Commission on Audit* (2020):** Cites Rule 2d regarding undue prejudice due to delays.
*   ***Paredes v. COA* (1982):** Defines "monthly salary" as basic salary excluding allowances.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **DBP Circular No. 10’s definition of “gross monthly cash compensation”:** This was the core issue, as it conflicted with established guidelines on what constitutes the base for MVLC.
*   **Validity of PGMA's Approval:** The timing of the approval within the prohibited period before elections was a point of contention, ultimately resolved against DBP.

**Potential Risks (Mitigated by Supreme Court Ruling):**

*   **Financial Liability:** DBP officials and employees faced the risk of having to reimburse the disallowed amounts.
*   **Damage to DBP's Financial Standing:** The outstanding disallowances negatively impacted DBP's financial standing and compliance with regulatory bodies.
*   **Prejudice to Retired Employees:** Disallowances created hurdles in settling the final dues of retired employees.

**Supreme Court Ruling (Motion for Partial Reconsideration Granted):**

The Supreme Court granted DBP's motion, setting aside the COA's decisions due to the COA's violation of DBP's constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases. While upholding the *grounds* for disallowance of the MVLC payment method, the Court absolved DBP and its personnel from liability solely based on the excessive delay by the COA. The SC upheld COA's role in examining and auditing government expenditures and revenues, and that COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion nor usurp COMELEC's jurisdiction when determining the validity of PGMA's approval of the Compensation Plan.
