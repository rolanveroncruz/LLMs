**Case Summary: *Concordia Medel Gomez v. Corazon Medel Alcantara*, G.R. No. 179556, February 13, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision dismissing Civil Case No. 04-111160 on the ground of res judicata.

**Facts:** Petitioner seeks ownership of a property (Lot No. 2259-A) based on a purported gift from her father, Ponciano Medel. She initially filed Civil Case No. 97-84159 for specific performance and damages. This case was dismissed for failure to prosecute under Rule 17, Section 3 of the Rules of Court after her counsel failed to appear despite notice. No appeal was filed. Petitioner later re-filed a similar action as Civil Case No. 04-111160. Respondent asserted res judicata based on the dismissal of the earlier case. The Court of Appeals upheld the application of *res judicata*, dismissing the second case.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Rule 17, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Dismissal for failure to prosecute has the effect of adjudication on the merits, unless the court explicitly states otherwise.
*   **Deed of Absolute Sale (1962):** Ponciano and Isabel Medel distributed land to their children. Petitioner received less land because her father's intention was to give her Lot No. 2259-A.
*   **Deed of Donation (1980):** Teodora (petitioner's sister) allegedly donated Lot No. 2259-A to the respondent.

**Liabilities and Potential Risks:**

*   **Res Judicata:** The dismissal of Civil Case No. 97-84159, having become final and executory, operates as a bar to the re-filing of the same action due to the principle of *res judicata*. The court found all four elements of res judicata to be present: (1) Final judgment in the previous case; (2) Jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and the parties; (3) Judgement on the merits; and (4) Identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action.
*   **Negligence of Counsel:** Petitioner argued she was deprived of her day in court due to the negligence of her former counsel.  However, the court held that the negligence of counsel binds the client, and the petitioner had her opportunity to be heard in the initial case.
*   **Title Issues:** The validity of the transfer of title from Ponciano to Teodora, and subsequently from Teodora to the respondent, via the Deed of Donation, is critical.  The court, however, did not delve into the merits of the underlying claim due to *res judicata*.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 17, Section 3, Rules of Court:** Governing dismissal for failure to prosecute.
*   **Ko v. Philippine National Bank, G.R. Nos. 169131-32, 20 January 2006:**  Affirmed dismissal for lack of interest to prosecute.
*   **Pasiona, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 165471, 21 July 2008:** Emphasizes the availability of opportunity to be heard as the basis for due process compliance.
*   **Dela Cruz v. Andres, G.R. No. 161864, 27 April 2007:** Affirms that opportunity to defend interests in due course constitutes due process.
*   **Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 430 Phil. 812 (2002):** Negligence of counsel does not deprive petitioner of due process of law.
*   **Victory Liner, Inc. v. Gammad, G.R. No. 159636, 25 November 2004:** The opportunity to present one's side of the controversy, not the success in defending one's rights, is the determining factor for due process.
*   **Cruz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 164797, 13 February 2006** Provides that the dismissal of a case for failure to prosecute is an adjudication on the merits.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Nature of the Transfer to Teodora:**  Petitioner claims Teodora held the title in trust, while respondent argues it was a valid sale. This issue was not resolved on the merits due to *res judicata*.
*   **Validity of the Deed of Donation:**  Petitioner alleges the Deed of Donation was executed in secrecy. This was not investigated, and the Court's decision rested solely on the principle of res judicata.

**Legal Opinion:**

The Court correctly applied *res judicata* given the finality of the dismissal of Civil Case No. 97-84159. The petitioner's recourse was to appeal the initial dismissal, not to re-file the same action. A potential argument, although unlikely to succeed given established jurisprudence, would be to demonstrate egregious error amounting to extrinsic fraud, preventing a fair submission of the original claim. The negligence of the original counsel is binding on the client.
