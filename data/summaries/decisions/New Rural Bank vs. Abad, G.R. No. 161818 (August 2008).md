**Case Summary: *New Rural Bank of Guimba (N.E.), Inc. v. Fermina S. Abad and Rafael Susan***

**Citation:** 584 Phil. 481 (G.R. No. 161818, August 20, 2008)

**Nature of the Case:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' decision affirming the RTC's ruling in favor of the respondents-spouses.

**Facts:**

*   Respondents (Abad spouses) obtained a loan from Petitioner (New Rural Bank of Guimba) secured by a real estate mortgage on their property.
*   Respondents claimed full payment of the loan, evidenced by receipts, and filed suit to nullify the foreclosure sale and related documents after the bank foreclosed on the mortgage.
*   Petitioner alleged non-payment and valid foreclosure.

**RTC Ruling:**  Ruled in favor of the respondents, finding that the payments were proven and ordering the cancellation of the foreclosure, certificate of sale, and transfer certificate of title in favor of the bank. The RTC also awarded attorney's fees and litigation expenses.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Principal Issue:** Whether respondents fully paid their mortgage loan to petitioner. Primarily a question of fact: credibility of evidence of payments vs. assertion of non-payment.
*   **Evidence of Payment:** Receipts for payments allegedly made by the respondents were presented. The critical element: "full payment on the balance" inscribed in the receipt.
*   **Petitioner's Defense:** Claims the payments were for obligations to Unifarm Agro Trading Center and Unifarm Ricemill and Bonded Warehouse, entities associated with the bank president.
*   **Special Power of Attorney:** Respondents allege the SPA in favor of the bank is void (likely for being obtained under duress or misrepresentation).

**Obligations:**

*   **Respondents:** Obligation to repay the loan according to the mortgage agreement.
*   **Petitioner:** Obligation to properly apply payments made by respondents. The existence of the mortgage agreement would need to be produced.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Potential Liability of the Bank:** If the foreclosure was wrongful (due to prior full payment), the bank may be liable for damages (moral, actual, exemplary), attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.
*   **Potential Liability of Spouses:** If the Bank can properly prove non-payment, then the Spouses would be in default of the loan obligation and subject to the penalties associated with it.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Factual Nature of the Dispute:** The core issue is whether payments were made and properly applied, which is heavily reliant on evidence and witness credibility. This is a high hurdle for an appeal based solely on questions of law.
*   **Piercing the Corporate Veil Argument:** The bank argued that the payments made to Unifarm entities should not be considered as payment to the bank.
*   **Delay in Foreclosure:** The long interval between the loan due date and the foreclosure was considered by the trial court as an indication of payment. This is not in and of itself a substantive element, but certainly does not speak to the merits of the bank's defense.
*   **SPA Validity:** The Special Power of Attorney is questionable. Was it executed voluntarily and with full understanding, or was it a product of fraud or coercion? If invalid, actions taken under the SPA might be challenged.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Limits Supreme Court review to questions of law. *Bukidnon Doctors' Hospital, Inc. v. Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co.* (G.R. No. 161882, July 8, 2005) reiterates the distinction between questions of law and questions of fact in appellate review.
*   **Civil Code provisions on obligations and contracts, including payment, novation, and validity of mortgages.** Relevant to the nature of the loan agreement.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact nature of the relationship between the bank and the Unifarm entities is unclear. Were they alter egos? Was the president acting in his capacity for the entities as well as the bank? This could impact the assessment of whether payments to Unifarm entities constituted payment to the bank.
*   Details on the circumstances surrounding the SPA execution are lacking. The annotation mentions an SPA executed by Fermina, but the circumstances of execution are ambiguous.

**Strategic Considerations:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, primarily because the issues raised were factual, not legal.
