## Legal Document Summary: *Bernardita F. Antiporda vs. Francisco A. Ante, Jr.* (A.M. No. MTJ-18-1908)

**Nature:** Administrative case for grave misconduct against a Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) Judge, Francisco A. Ante, Jr.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Allegations:** Complainant alleged that Judge Ante assaulted her (slapping, whipping with a dog chain, pointing a gun) due to a neighborly dispute regarding building code violations and reported illegal construction.
*   **Respondent's Defense:** Judge Ante claimed self-defense, alleging the complainant attacked him with a steel chain and ordered others to attack him with bolos. He also alleged the complainant harbored a grudge against him for reporting her illegal construction.
*   **Complainant's Desistance:** Complainant initially sought dismissal, claiming accidental injury and wanting to restore good relations. The OCA (Office of the Court Administrator) denied the request, stating desistance doesn't automatically warrant dismissal.
*   **OCA Recommendation:** Found Judge Ante guilty of grave misconduct for failing to exercise tolerance and self-restraint, resulting in physical injuries. Due to Judge Ante's prior offense and subsequent retirement, the OCA initially recommended a fine of P100,000 to be deducted from retirement benefits.
*   **Court Ruling:** Upheld the finding of grave misconduct, citing violations of the New Code of Judicial Conduct (Canon 2 and Canon 4 regarding integrity, propriety, and judicial temperament).
*   **Sanction:**  Due to retirement, the Court ordered forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations.

**Obligations:**

*   Judges are obligated to maintain integrity, propriety, and judicial temperament (sobriety, self-restraint, courtesy) both in official duties and personal demeanor. (New Code of Judicial Conduct)

**Liabilities:**

*   Judge Ante found liable for **grave misconduct** due to his conduct, which resulted in physical injuries to the complainant and violated the Code of Judicial Conduct.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Conflicting Testimony:**  The case hinges on conflicting testimonies regarding who initiated the violence and who wielded the chain.
*   **Complainant's Recantation:** While the Court rightly disregards the recantation as insufficient for dismissal, it could have complicated the fact-finding process if the evidence wasn't strong enough to independently support the charges.
*   **Mitigation Argument:** The OCA considered the judge's years of service as a mitigating factor in the initial penalty recommendation; However, Supreme Court deemed Forfeiture of all retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office appropriate, highlighting the seriousness of the offense, especially given the prior administrative conviction.
