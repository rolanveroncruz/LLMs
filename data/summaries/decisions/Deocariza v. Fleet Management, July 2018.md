**Case:** *Melchor Barcenas Deocariza v. Fleet Management Services Philippines, Inc., et al.* G.R. No. 229955, July 23, 2018.

**Summary:**

The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' decision denying total and permanent disability benefits to a seafarer (Petitioner) who contracted Aplastic Anemia during his employment. The Court found that the CA erred in concluding the Petitioner concealed a pre-existing heart condition and further erred in finding the condition was not work related.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **2010 POEA-SEC, Section 20(A):** Employer's liability for work-related injury or illness during the contract term. Specifically mentions compensation and benefits for work related incidents.
*   **2010 POEA-SEC, Section 20(E):** Seafarer's obligation to disclose pre-existing illnesses during PEME. Failure to disclose disqualifies compensation.
*   **2010 POEA-SEC, Section 32-A, No. 7:** Lists *anemia of the aplastic type due to x-rays, ionizing particle, radium or other radioactive substances* as a work-related disease under certain conditions.
*   Employer's obligation to provide medical attention and sickness allowance until declared fit or disability assessed (within 120/240 days).

**Liabilities and Benefits:**

*   **Disability Benefits:** The court awarded petitioner US$60,000.00 for permanent total disability benefits under the 2010 POEA-SEC.
*   **Attorney's Fees:** 10% of the award.
*   **No Moral/Exemplary Damages:** Absent evidence of ill-motive by the employer.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Concealment Clause (Section 20(E)):** Respondents alleged Petitioner concealed a pre-existing heart condition ("mechanical heart valves"). The SC found this claim unsubstantiated, as medical records presented during appeal showed that petitioner had no such condition. The employer bears the burden of proving concealment.
*   **Work-Relatedness of Illness (Section 32-A):** Respondents argued Aplastic Anemia was not work-related. The court recognized Aplastic Anemia as an occupational disease when contracted under specific conditions and found a causal link between Petitioner's exposure to Benzene in gasoline, during the loading/unloading of vehicles on the vessel, and his Aplastic Anemia. Employer's failure to provide a conclusive assessment within the 240-day period resulted in the petitioner being conclusively presumed totally and permanently disabled.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Articles 197-199 (formerly 191-193):** Disability benefits.
*   **Amended Rules on Employee Compensation, Section 2(a), Rule X:** Temporary total disability benefits.
*   **Civil Code, Article 2208:** Attorney's fees in actions for indemnity.

**Case Law:**

*   The decision cites several cases regarding the 120/240-day period for assessment of disability, highlighting the consequence of failing to provide a definitive assessment within that timeframe which triggers a conclusive presumption of total and permanent disability.
*   Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc., 588 Phil. 895, 912 (2008).

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation and application of Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC regarding what constitutes "exposure" to hazardous substances and the standard of proof required to establish a causal link between the exposure and the illness.

**Legal Precision Points:**

*   The Court emphasized the distinction between disability benefits under the POEA-SEC versus those under a CBA, noting that the CBA's coverage requires an "accident" which was absent in this case.
*   The court highlights the hierarchy of applicable law. Law, parties' contracts, and medical findings are the governing factors. The POEA-SEC is deemed incorporated in every seafarer's employment contract.
