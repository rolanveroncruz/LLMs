# DUTERTE Youth Party-List v. COMELEC, P3PWD, Guanzon - Case Summary

**Citation:** G.R. No. 261123 & 261876, August 20, 2024

**Nature of the Case:** Consolidated petitions: (1) Petition for Certiorari (Rule 65) challenging COMELEC resolutions approving P3PWD party-list nominee substitutions and (2) Petition for Indirect Contempt against former COMELEC Commissioner Guanzon.

**Key Provisions and Facts:**

*   **Party-List Substitution:** P3PWD, after being proclaimed as a winner in the May 2022 elections, experienced the resignation of all its original nominees. It then submitted a new list of nominees, including Guanzon. COMELEC approved the substitution via Minute Resolution No. 22-0774 by a vote of 3-1.
*   **DUTERTE Youth's Opposition:** DUTERTE Youth opposed the substitution, arguing it violated deadlines set by COMELEC Resolution No. 9366, as amended. The Opposition was denied.
*   **COMELEC Resolutions:** DUTERTE Youth challenges Minute Resolution Nos. 22-0774 (approving substitution), 22-0798 (noting publication), and 22-0810 (denying DUTERTE Youth's Opposition).
*   **Temporary Restraining Order (TRO):** The Supreme Court issued a TRO enjoining COMELEC from implementing the substitution resolution and the House of Representatives from allowing Guanzon to assume office.
*   **Contempt Allegations:** Guanzon allegedly violated the TRO by filing a bill, referring to herself as congresswoman, and making statements that were contumacious to the court.
*   **Applicable Laws:**  The case primarily involves interpretation of Republic Act No. 7941 (Party-List System Act), specifically Sections 8 and 16, as well as COMELEC Resolutions (particularly No. 9366 and No. 10690) implementing the Act.
*   **Standing:** The Court found DUTERTE Youth lacks direct standing but allows the petition as concerned citizens due to the transcendental importance of the issues.

**Holding:**

*   The Supreme Court *GRANTED* the Petition in G.R. No. 261123, declaring COMELEC Minute Resolution No. 22-0774 *NULL and VOID* for grave abuse of discretion insofar as it approved the substitution of the nominees of P3PWD. The Court's Temporary Restraining Order dated June 29, 2022 is made *PERMANENT*. Respondent P3PWD Party-List is DIRECTED to submit additional nominees pursuant to Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7941 but is STRICTLY ENJOINED from renominating for the duration of the Nineteenth Congress the nominees whose substitutions were declared null and void by this Decision, namely Ma. Rowena Amelia V. Guanzon, Rosalie J. Garcia, Cherrie B. Belmonte-Lim, Donnabel C. Tenorio, and Rodolfo B. Villar, Jr.
*   The Court *DISMISSED* the Petition in G.R. No. 261876 for lack of merit.
*   The Court *DISMISSED* Guanzon's countercharge for indirect contempt for being procedurally defective.

**Key Provisions, Obligations, and Liabilities:**

*   **Sec 8 RA 7941 vs. COMELEC Resolution:** The Supreme Court holds that while COMELEC can promulgate rules, it *exceeded its authority* by setting deadlines for substitution that effectively amended the statute and violated voters' right to information.
*   **COMELEC Duty of Information:** There is a continuing duty to provide information to the electorate. However, that duty was not considered in the decision.
*   **Sec 16 RA 7941:** Party-list directed to submit additional nominees but is prohibited from renominating the five individuals. *Potential issue: the legality and fairness of barring specific individuals from being nominated.*
*   **Contempt (Guanzon):**  The Court declines to hold Guanzon in contempt, citing a lack of clear and present danger and contumacious intent beyond reasonable doubt.
*   **Applicable Laws:** Sections 8 and 16 of RA 7941, COMELEC Resolution No. 9366 and COMELEC Resolution No. 10690, Rules of Procedure of COMELEC, Rules of Procedure of HRET.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Vagueness on Disqualification:** The decision appears to create a *de facto* disqualification for Guanzon *et al.* without explicitly invoking any legal basis for such a disqualification. Raises due process concerns.
*   **Impact on P3PWD:** This ruling severely impacts P3PWD's representation in Congress, forcing it to choose from a potentially limited pool of nominees.
*   **The interplay between 8 and 16 RA 7941.** Was not completely clarified in a way that may prove workable for future scenarios. The ponente's interpretation does not allow the substitution and withdrawal after the election before noon of the thirtieth day of June after the election.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Lokhin v. COMELEC (635 Phil. 372):** Defines the grounds for nominee substitution.
*   **COCOFED v. COMELEC (716 Phil. 19):** Discusses the publication requirement for party-list nominees.
*   **Engle v. COMELEC (778 Phil. 568):**  Addresses mandatory vs. directory election rules.
*   **Bantay Republic Act (BA-RA 7941) v. COMELEC (551 Phil. 1):** Confirms the right to know nominee identities.
*   **Mitra v. COMELEC (648 Phil. 165):** Discusses mandatory vs. directory election rules.
*   **Angcos v. Duterte Youth (G.R. No. 253805, November 3, 2020):** (Unsigned Resolution) Previous case involving DUTERTE Youth and nominee substitution (not binding precedent).

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The enforceability of the strict preclusion of Guanzon, Garcia, Belmonte-Lim, Tenorio, and Villar from being nominated as members of P3PWD.
*   Determination of whether the withdrawal by the original nominees is with a cause.

**Legal Strategy Considerations:**

*   **Motion for Reconsideration:** (Unlikely to succeed given the strong language.)
*   **Possible Challenge to the Enjoinment:** Focus the legal arguments on the qualifications of the individuals to serve as members of P3PWD.
