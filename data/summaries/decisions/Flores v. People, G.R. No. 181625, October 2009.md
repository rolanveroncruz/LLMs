**Legal Document Summary: Flores v. People, G.R. No. 181625 (2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a Court of Appeals Decision affirming a Regional Trial Court Joint Decision finding Petitioner Jerome Flores guilty of Frustrated Homicide.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Frustrated Homicide (Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code)
*   **Accusations:** Conspiracy in the shooting of Ronald B. Lim.  Flores, Tuason, and Nicolas were accused of conspiring to shoot Lim with an unlicensed firearm, with intent to kill.
*   **Evidence:** Prosecution presented eyewitness testimony from the victim, Lim, and his helper, Sareno.  Defense presented an alibi corroborated by a storekeeper. The police blotter entry had an inconsistent version of the events.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused (Flores):** To rebut the presumption of guilt and prove alibi.
*   **Prosecution:** To prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Flores:** Found jointly and severally liable with co-accused for civil indemnity (₱30,000.00) and actual damages (₱72,397.05) to Ronald Lim.
*   **Tuason:** Already convicted of Frustrated Homicide in a related case (Criminal Case No. 0515).
*   **Nicolas:** Convicted with Flores and Tuason in Criminal Case No. 0489.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistencies in the Police Blotter:** Defense argued that the initial police blotter entry, based on Sareno's statement, did not identify the assailants, implying that the later identification of Flores was fabricated.  The Court dismissed this argument, citing jurisprudence that positive identification prevails over police blotter entries.
*   **Res Gestae Argument:** Defense argued that Sareno's statement to the police was admissible as res gestae. The Court rejected this argument, holding that the res gestae rule does not apply when the declarant (Sareno) testifies in court and is subject to cross-examination.
*   **Alibi Defense:**  The court found Flores' alibi to be weak and unreliable.  The prosecution successfully argued that it wasn't physically impossible for Flores to be at the crime scene.
*   **Conspiracy:** Flores was convicted based on conspiracy with his co-accused. However, the degree of participation of each accused, particularly Nicholas, is not entirely clear in the summary, and the evidence supporting Nicholas' intent to kill is thin.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 6 (Frustrated Crimes), 248 (Murder - reduced to Frustrated Homicide in this case).
*   **People v. Dacibar and Dicon, G.R. No. 111286 (2000):**  Positive identification prevails over police blotter entries.
*   **People v. Gutierrez, G.R. Nos. 137610-11 (2002):** Police blotter entries are not conclusive proof of identity.
*   **People v. Cabrera, Jr., G.R. No. 138266 (2003):**  Discrepancies in the police blotter do not necessarily impair witness credibility.
*   **People v. Legaspi, G.R. Nos. 136164-65 (2001):**  Police blotter entries are not conclusive proof, especially considering the traumatic nature of the reported event.
*   **People v. Mansueto, G.R. No. 135196 (2000):**  Alibi is a weak defense.

**Ambiguities:**

*   The exact role of Nicholas and Absalon could be examined in more detail. While their presence and support for the acts of Tuazon and Flores may establish conspiracy, their respective intent to kill needs further evaluation. The act of Nicolas kicking the victim could be a turning point on his intentions during the event.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction based on the positive identification by the victims and the weakness of the alibi presented by the accused. The court relied heavily on established jurisprudence regarding the weight of police blotter entries versus positive eyewitness testimony. The petitioner's arguments regarding *res gestae* were properly dismissed because the witness was able to testify in the proceeding.
