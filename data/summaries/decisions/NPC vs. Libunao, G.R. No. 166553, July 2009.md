## Legal Document Summary: *Republic vs. Spouses Libunao & Heirs of Domingo* (G.R. No. 166553)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision modifying a Regional Trial Court (RTC) decision regarding just compensation in an eminent domain case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Eminent Domain:** National Power Corporation (NPC) sought to expropriate portions of land owned by Spouses Libunao and Heirs of Domingo for its Cabanatuan-Talavera 69 KV Transmission Line Project. Specifically, NPC wanted to take the whole land owned by the Spouses Libunao (1,212 sq m) and a portion of the land owned by the Heirs of Domingo (4,380 sq m).
*   **Just Compensation:** The central issue is the amount of just compensation due to the landowners. The RTC determined a price based on the fair market value as of the filing of the complaint. The CA modified this, referencing an earlier appraisal by the City Appraisal Committee (CAC). The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision.
*   **Easement vs. Full Ownership:** NPC argued it only needed an easement (right-of-way) and should only pay 10% of the market value per R.A. 6395, Sec. 3-A. The Court rejected this, stating that given the nature of transmission lines and the limitations placed on the land owners' use, full compensation based on market value is appropriate.
*   **Interest:** The RTC ordered the payment of legal interest from the date of taking (January 7-8, 1998) until fully paid. The Supreme Court upheld this.

**Obligations:**

*   **NPC:** Obligated to pay just compensation to Spouses Libunao and Heirs of Domingo based on the full market value of the land, not merely an easement fee. This includes the payment of legal interest (6%) from the date of taking.
*   **Landowners:** The Landowners are obligated to transfer ownership of the land to NPC upon receipt of the compensation and interests.

**Liabilities:**

*   **NPC:** Liable for just compensation, legal interest, and potentially damages to improvements (already paid in this case).

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Valuation Date:** While the Court refers to fair market value, the specific date for determining this value is not explicitly stated. This could be a point of contention in calculating the final compensation.
*   **Consequential Damages:** While consequential damages were initially paid for damaged improvements. These are not included in the just compensation calculation.
*   **Implementation:** Enforcing the judgment and ensuring timely payment by NPC could present practical challenges.

**Relevant Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. 6395, Section 3-A:** NPC's argument for only paying 10% easement fee is based on this provision. The Court rejects the applicability of this provision in this particular case.
*   **Rule 67, Section 10, Rules of Court:** Basis for the payment of legal interest in expropriation cases.
*   **NPC v. Manubay Agro-Industrial Development Corporation (G.R. No. 150936):** Established the precedent that taking land for high-powered transmission lines warrants full compensation, not merely an easement fee. This is the controlling doctrine.
*   **NPC v. Aguirre-Paderanga (G.R. No. 155065):** Highlights the significant restriction and safety risk transmission lines impose on landowners, justifying full compensation.

**Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Easement vs. Full Taking:** This was the main point of contention, with NPC arguing for a lesser payment based on the "easement" nature of the taking. The Supreme Court refuted this argument.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the CA's decision requiring NPC to pay just compensation based on the full market value of the land, plus legal interest from the date of taking. NPC's arguments based on the easement nature of the taking and R.A. 6395 were rejected.
