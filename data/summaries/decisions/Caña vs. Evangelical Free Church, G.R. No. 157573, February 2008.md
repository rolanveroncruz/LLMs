**Legal Document Summary: *Elinel Ca単a v. Evangelical Free Church of the Philippines*, G.R. No. 157573, February 11, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing CA decision in an ejectment case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   Dispute centers on possession of property (church lot and building) covered by TCT No. 96813 registered in the name of the Evangelical Free Church of the Philippines (Respondent).
*   Respondent (EFCP) granted permission to Petitioner (Ca単a, former pastor of affiliate MCEC) to occupy the property.
*   Respondent revoked Petitioner's license and demanded he vacate the property.
*   Respondent filed ejectment suit against Petitioner when he refused to vacate.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner (Ca単a):** Obligated to vacate the property and surrender peaceful possession to Respondent (EFCP). Failed to prove right to remain in possession. Potentially liable for reasonable compensation for use/occupation, though claim was denied due to lack of factual basis.
*   **Respondent (EFCP):** Obligated to demonstrate superior right to possession based on ownership.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **For Petitioner (Ca単a):** Continued occupation could lead to further legal action (e.g., action for damages). Risk of not being able to recover the payment made for CARF loan. The decision regarding the right of ownership of the property.
*   **For Respondent (EFCP):** Risk that the court may consider the affidavits and resolutions presented by the petitioner, despite not having sufficient evidence.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ownership of the Property:** The core dispute is not the *title* to the property, but *who paid* for the property. The petitioner argues MCEC paid, while the respondent has the TCT. This is intertwined with the pastor-church relationship and the CARF Loan.
*   **CARF Loan:** The petitioner's argument that the CARF loan payments represent payment for the disputed property is tenuous.

**Key Judgments:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' reversal of the RTC decision.
*   Petitioner was ordered to vacate the property.
*   Substantial compliance with requirements for forum shopping (subsequent submission of board resolution) deemed acceptable.
*   The CA Decision stated that such pronouncements are provisional and would not bar/prejudice an action between the same parties involving title to the property.
