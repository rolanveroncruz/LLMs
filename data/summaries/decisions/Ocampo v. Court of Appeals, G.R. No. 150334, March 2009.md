Okay, here's a concise legal summary of the document, formatted in markdown:

**Case:** *Ocampo, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.* G.R. No. 150334, March 20, 2009. (601 Phil. 43)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45, challenging the CA's decision affirming the nullification of a PALEA (Philippine Airlines Employees Association) election.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Background:** Dispute arose from the PALEA election held in Feb 2000. Private Respondent Oredina questioned the election results, leading to DOLE-NCR nullifying the election and ordering a new one. The BLR affirmed DOLE-NCR's decision. Only Peñas initially filed certiorari with the CA, which was denied.
*   **Central Issue:** Whether the Petitioners, who were co-respondents with Peñas before DOLE-NCR and BLR but *not* parties to the CA case, have standing to file a petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court.

**Holding:**

The Supreme Court denied the petition, holding that the Petitioners lacked standing to appeal to the Supreme Court because they failed to timely challenge the BLR Resolution.  They did not join Peñas in the CA petition, rendering the BLR Resolution final and binding against them.

**Legal Reasoning & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 45, Rules of Court:** Governs petitions for review on certiorari.  The Court emphasized that a Rule 45 petition is a continuation of the original suit.
*   **Rule 65, Rules of Court:** Discussed regarding Petitioners’ failure to file for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Finality of Judgments:** The Court emphasized the importance of the finality of judgments.  Citing *Anadon v. Herrera*, the Court reiterated the principle that when a party fails to question an adverse judgment within the prescribed period, that judgment becomes final and binding.
*   **Standing:** The Court determined that because the Petitioners did not join the original action filed with the Court of Appeals, they lack standing to appeal to the Supreme Court.
*   **Counter Assignment of Errors:** The Court cites *Siliman University v. Fontelo-Paalan* and *Itogon-Suyoc Mines Inc. v. NLRC* and states that a party cannot impugn the correctness of a judgment not appealed from by him and while he may make counter assignment of errors, he can do so only to sustain the judgment on other grounds but not to seek modification or reversal thereof, for in such case, he must appeal.
*   **Mootness:** Court noted that the contested five-year term had already expired. *Lanuza, Jr. v. Yuchengco*
*   **Estoppel:** The Court states that the Petitioners actively participated in the formulation of PALEA election guidelines with the DOLE-NCR, following the order of the BLR for the union to conduct a new election and therefore are estopped from further pursuing this petition

**Potential Risks & Issues:**

*   **Procedural Lapses:** Petitioners' failure to exhaust administrative remedies and/or timely file their own petition for certiorari before the CA was fatal to their case.
*   **Standing:** The case highlights the critical importance of establishing and maintaining proper standing throughout the litigation process.
*   **Preclusion:** Losing parties should be wary of actions that could be construed as acquiescence to an unfavorable ruling (e.g., participating in a subsequent election).
*   **Mootness:** The time sensitivity of the case with regard to the expiration of terms.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   There does not appear to be any specifically ambiguous or contentious clauses within the document itself. The core of the legal dispute revolves around procedural and standing issues.
