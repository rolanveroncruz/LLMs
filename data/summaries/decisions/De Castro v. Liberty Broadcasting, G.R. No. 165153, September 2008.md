## Legal Document Summary: *De Castro v. Liberty Broadcasting Network, Inc.*

**Case Citation:** G.R. No. 165153, September 23, 2008, 587 Phil. 680

**Nature of the Document:** Supreme Court Decision on a Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA's ruling on an illegal dismissal case.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioner:** Carlos C. de Castro (former Building Administrator)
*   **Respondents:** Liberty Broadcasting Network, Inc. (employer) and Edgardo Quiogue (Executive Vice President)

**Key Issue:** Whether the dismissal of the petitioner was legal or illegal.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals (CA) decision and reinstated the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) resolution finding the dismissal illegal.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Employer's Obligation:** Burden of proving just cause for termination (Art. 277(a), Labor Code).
*   **Just Causes Cited by Employer:** Serious misconduct, fraud, willful breach of trust (Art. 282, Labor Code), violation of company code of conduct, including soliciting commissions, theft, disrespect, disorderly behavior, threat, coercion, abuse of authority, and slander.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Respondent is liable for illegal dismissal of the Petitioner

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity:** The reliance on witness testimony that lacked credibility.
*   **Risk:** Wrongful dismissal claim resulting in potential reinstatement, back wages, and damages for the employee.
*   **Risk:** Potential challenges to company policies and procedures related to supplier relationships and employee conduct.

**Statutory and Case Law References:**

*   **Article 4 of the Labor Code:** Interpretation of doubts in favor of the employee.
*   **Article 277(a) of the Labor Code:** Employer's burden of proof in termination cases.
*   **Article 282 of the Labor Code:** Just causes for termination.
*   *Cosmos Bottling Corporation v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 146397): Respect for NLRC findings supported by substantial evidence.
*   *Flores v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 116419): Scope of certiorari does not include re-evaluation of evidence.
*   *Rudy A. Palecpec, Jr. v. Hon. Corazon C. Davis, et al.* (G.R. No.171048): Court is not a trier of facts.

*   *Nicario v. NLRC* (G.R. No. 125340): Doubts resolved in favor of the employee.

**Contentious Clauses and Reasoning:**

*   **Solicitation of Commissions:** The key issue revolved around the alleged solicitation of commissions by the Petitioner from company suppliers. The SC found the evidence supporting this charge highly suspect due to the witnesses' potential bias, conflicting relationships, and the unusual timing of the accusations. The court found the claims were not credible.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The SC questioned the credibility of the witnesses presented by the employer, citing their prior altercations with the petitioner, their subordinate relationships with implicated managers, and the recantation of one key witness (Aying).
*   **Timing of Charges:** The SC emphasized the suspicious timing of the charges, noting that they arose shortly after the Petitioner questioned the Executive Vice President's awarding of a contract and reported incidents of misconduct by other employees.
*   The case highlights the principle that even if an employee is accused of serious misconduct, the employer must still prove the allegations with clear and convincing evidence, especially when the circumstances surrounding the accusations are questionable.

**Conclusion:**

The SC, citing Article 4 of the Labor Code, resolved doubts in favor of the employee, finding that the employer failed to meet its burden of proving just cause for the termination. The decision underscores the importance of thoroughly investigating accusations, considering the credibility and potential biases of witnesses, and avoiding actions that could be perceived as retaliatory. The ruling serves as a reminder to employers to ensure fairness and due process in disciplinary actions against employees.
