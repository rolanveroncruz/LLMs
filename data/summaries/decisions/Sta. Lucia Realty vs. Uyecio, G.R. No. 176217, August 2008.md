**Case Summary: Sta. Lucia Realty Development Inc. vs. Uyecio, G.R. No. 176217, August 13, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari of a Court of Appeals decision affirming HLURB and Office of the President rulings regarding the rescission (corrected to cancellation) of contracts to sell real property.

**Facts:** Respondents (Uyecios) entered into contracts to sell with Petitioner (Sta. Lucia) for lots in a subdivision project.  Petitioner represented that the project, including specific amenities, would be completed by September 1999. Respondents paid downpayments and monthly amortizations but suspended payments in April 2001 due to Petitioner's failure to complete the project. An HLURB ocular inspection confirmed the project's incompleteness. Respondents filed a complaint with the HLURB seeking project completion or, alternatively, a refund.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contracts to Sell:** Installment payments for lots, with a promised completion date of September 1999.  Petitioner obligated to complete advertised amenities.
*   **Payment Schedule:** Downpayment + balance payable in 10 years at 21% interest p.a.
*   **Petitioner's Promises:** Development of amenities (church, clubhouse, pool, etc.) advertised in sales brochures.
*   **License to Sell (R4-98-12-0203):** Allows Petitioner to apply for an extension to complete the project *before its expiration* (ambiguous if this extension was properly obtained).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner's Breach:** Failure to complete the project according to the promised timeline and advertised amenities. This is considered a material breach justifying the Respondents' suspension of payments under Section 23 of PD 957 (Non-Forfeiture of Payments).
*   **Refund Obligation:** Petitioner ordered to refund payments, including amortization interest, to Respondents.

**Remedy:**

*   HLURB ordered the rescission (incorrectly, as it was a contract to sell), which the Supreme Court corrected to a **cancellation** of the Contracts to Sell.
*   Monetary damages, including principal refund, interest, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, were awarded to Respondents.  Interest was reduced from 12% to 6% p.a. from the date of filing of the complaint, following *Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals*.
*   Administrative fine of P20,000.00 for violation of Sections 19 and 20 in relation to Section 38 of P.D. 957.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Extension to Complete Project:** The provision in the License to Sell allowing for an extension of time to complete the development *before its expiration* is ambiguous. It is unclear from the facts whether the Petitioner properly obtained an extension, or if this was obtained *within the proper period*.
*   **Asian Pacific Realty Brokerage, Inc.:** Petitioner's attempt to disclaim responsibility for the advertising materials of the marketing firm.  Argument rejected by the HLURB and upheld by the CA and SC.
*   **Damages:** The Court sustained the award of moral and exemplary damages, creating potential for future claims based on similar incomplete development projects.
*   **Interest Rate:** Change in the interest rate from 12% to 6% is significant and reflects current jurisprudence.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Presidential Decree (PD) No. 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree):** Section 23 (Non-Forfeiture of Payments), Sections 19 and 20 in relation to Section 38.
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1191 (incorrectly applied by HLURB)
*   **Article 2208:** Attorney's fees

**Case Law:**

*   ***Rillo v. Court of Appeals***:  Distinguishes between a contract to sell and a contract of sale, emphasizing that Article 1191 does not apply to contracts to sell.
*   ***Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals***: Applied for the interest rate on the refund (6% instead of 12%).
*   ***Fil-Estate Properties, Inc. v. Go***

**Key Holding:** Failure of the developer to complete the project within the promised timeframe constitutes a breach of contract, justifying the cancellation of the contracts to sell and the award of damages to the buyers.  Article 1191 of the Civil Code on rescission is not applicable to contracts to sell; cancellation is the correct remedy.

**Note:**  The Court's correction of "rescission" to "cancellation" in the dispositive portion is critical. A contract to sell does not create an obligation to transfer ownership until the purchase price is fully paid; therefore, a failure to complete development is not a breach of an existing obligation but a failure of a condition precedent.
