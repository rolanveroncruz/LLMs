## Legal Document Summary: CIR v. Cebu Holdings, Inc. (G.R. No. 189792)

**Nature:** Petition for Review assailing the CTA En Banc's decision regarding Cebu Holdings, Inc.'s (CHI) claim for a tax credit certificate (TCC) for excess creditable withholding taxes (CWT) for taxable year 2002.

**Key Provisions and Holdings:**

*   **Tax Credit Certificate (TCC) for 2002:** The Supreme Court (SC) affirmed the CTA's decision, ordering the CIR to issue a TCC to CHI in the amount of P2,083,878.07, representing excess CWT for 2002.
*   The court followed the prior year's excess credits and CWT that were allowed by CTA, based on the Independent CPA’s findings, which was further decreased due to several disallowances.
*   The SC upheld the CTA’s finding that the claim for refund/TCC was filed within the two-year prescriptive period under the Tax Code, with the claim filed with the BIR on 4 March 2005 and the Petition for Review before the CTA on 15 April 2005 and filing the ITR on April 15, 2003.
*   **Deficiency Assessment for 2003:** Crucially, the SC *modified* the CTA decision, finding CHI liable for deficiency income tax of P8,540,182.00 for 2003 due to the erroneous carryover of P16,194,108.00 as prior year's excess credits. The court reasoned that the CTA's prior disallowance of the prior year’s excess credits (except for P288,076.04) in the 2002 TCC case precluded CHI from carrying it over to 2003.
*   The court cited Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) and ordered the CIR to issue a final assessment notice and demand letter for the 2003 deficiency. The court stated no pre-assessment notice is required.

**Obligations:**

*   **CIR:** Issue a TCC for P2,083,878.07 for 2002 and issue a final assessment notice and demand letter for the P8,540,182.00 deficiency for 2003.
*   **CHI:** Liable for the deficiency income tax of P8,540,182.00 for 2003 and must pay upon receipt of the assessment notice and demand letter.

**Liabilities:**

*   CHI is liable for deficiency income tax for 2003. Failure to pay within the statutory period will subject it to penalties and interest.

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **2003 Assessment:** The SC's insertion of the 2003 assessment into the 2002 TCC case might be challenged by CHI, as it expands the scope of the original controversy. The court based this insertion on the carryover of the unsubstantiated excess prior years credit to the 2003 ITR of CHI.
*   **Section 228 NIRC Interpretation:** The court’s assertion that no pre-assessment notice is required for the 2003 assessment due to CHI carrying over the prior years excess credits to the current ITR might be challenged by CHI.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **NIRC Section 228:** Discusses the requirements for assessment of taxes, including the notice requirements.
