## Legal Document Summary: *Bon-Mar Realty and Sport Corporation v. Spouses Nicanor and Esther De Guzman, et al.* (G.R. Nos. 182136-37, August 29, 2008)

**Case Overview:** This case involves consolidated appeals concerning ownership and possession of two lots in Greenhills, San Juan. The central dispute revolves around conflicting claims between the De Guzmans (original owners), Bon-Mar Realty (claiming ownership through subsequent transactions), and the Uys (intermediate buyers). It is relevant to intervention, writ of possession, and contempt proceedings.

**Key Provisions & Holdings:**

*   **Bon-Mar's Intervention in Civil Case No. 56393 (Annulment & Reconveyance):** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and held that Bon-Mar **can** intervene in Civil Case No. 56393. The basis is the final and executory judgment in Civil Case No. 67315, which declared Bon-Mar the owner of the subject lots as the successor-in-interest of the De Guzmans. This gives Bon-Mar a *legal interest* to protect, satisfying the requirements for intervention under **Rule 3, Section 8 of the Rules of Court**.
*   **Writ of Possession in Favor of De Guzmans:** The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and held that the De Guzmans are **not** entitled to a writ of possession *pending resolution* of Bon-Mar's intervention and third-party claim. Issuing the writ before resolving Bon-Mar's claim would be a futile exercise.
*   **De Guzmans' Intervention in SCA No. 2988-SJ (Contempt):** The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals dismissal of contempt charges.Bon-Mar brought a special civil action against the Register of Deeds.The Court held that the contempt proceeding against the Registrar of Deeds was **improper.** The correct remedy for denial of registration is a *consulta* to the Commissioner of Land Registration under **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 117** with appeal to the Court of Appeals under **Rule 43.**, The De Guzmans are therefore not needed as a party in the contempt proceeding and may not intervene.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **RTC (Pasig City, Branch 168):** Obligated to receive evidence on Bon-Mar's third-party claim in Civil Case No. 56393 to determine the nature and extent of its claim to the subject lots and to hold in abeyance the enforcement of the writ of possession. The trial court is specifically directed to consider Bon-Mar's third-party claim under **Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court**.
*   **Bon-Mar:** Obligated to present evidence substantiating its claim of ownership in Civil Case No. 56393, including proving its acquisition from the Garcias, who purportedly acquired the properties from the De Guzmans after their initial victory.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Proof of Acquisition Chain:** A key risk for Bon-Mar is failing to convincingly prove the transfer of ownership from the De Guzmans to the Garcias and then to Bon-Mar. If the chain is broken, Bon-Mar's claim to successor-in-interest status weakens considerably.
*   **"Satisfied" Judgment Argument:** Bon-Mar argues that the De Guzmans' claim in Civil Case No. 56393 has been fully satisfied as early as 1995 and any attempt to execute is unlawful. This argument hinges on proving the validity and completeness of the transactions leading to Bon-Mar's alleged ownership.
*   **Res Judicata/Law of the Case:** The prior CA decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 82807 (finding Bon-Mar a stranger to the litigation) is discussed. The Supreme Court essentially carved out an exception, stating that the facts giving rise to that decision no longer hold true due to the finality of Civil Case No. 67315. This is a contentious point, as prior rulings generally bind subsequent proceedings. The prior decision should be scrutinized to see if any issues were not fully adjudicated and should be taken as law of the case.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 3, Section 8, Rules of Court:** (Intervention)
*   **Rule 39, Section 16, Rules of Court:** (Third-Party Claims)
*   **Presidential Decree No. 1529, Section 117:** (Consulta to Land Registration Authority)
*   **Rule 43:** (Appeal by Consulta)
*   **Mabayo Farms, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 140058, August 1, 2002:** (Requisites for intervention)
*   **Garcia v. David, 67 Phil. 279, 284 (1939):** (Interest required for intervention)
*   **China Banking Corp. v. Ordinario, G.R. No. 121943, March 24, 2003:** (Third-party claim rights)

**Overall Assessment:** The Supreme Court sided with Bon-Mar, providing it an opportunity to establish its claim of ownership. However, Bon-Mar faces a significant burden of proof in demonstrating the complete and valid chain of title. The decision also clarifies the proper remedy for disputes with the Register of Deeds in land registration matters, emphasizing the *consulta* process. The case leaves open the issue of proper ownership, which still needs to be determined, to ensure justice for all parties concerned.
