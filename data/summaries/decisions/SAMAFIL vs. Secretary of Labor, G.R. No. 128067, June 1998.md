## Legal Document Summary: *Samahan ng mga Manggagawa sa Filsystems (SAMAFIL-NAFLU-KMU) vs. Hon. Secretary of Labor and Employment and Filsystems, Inc.* G.R. No. 128067, June 05, 1998

**Nature:** Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65, assailing the DOLE Secretary's resolution and order dismissing a petition for certification election.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Petitioner's Argument:** SAMAFIL-NAFLU-KMU, a registered labor union, argues its right to a certification election as an independently registered union (Certificate of Registration No. NCR-UR-10-1575-95), irrespective of its (failed) attempt to prove affiliation with NAFLU-KMU. Contests that appeal wasn't moot due to premature CBA.
*   **Respondent FILSYSTEMS Argument:** Questions SAMAFIL's legitimacy based on failure to comply with requirements for affiliated unions (Section 3, Rule II, Book V, Implementing Rules of the Labor Code). Also argues appeal is moot due to a subsequent certification election won by Filsystem Workers Union (FWU) resulting in CBA with private respondent employer.
*   **Ruling:** The Supreme Court **GRANTED** the petition. The Sec. of Labor's Resolution and Order are set aside. BLR is ordered to hold a certification election.

**Obligations:**

*   **Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR):** Obligated to conduct a certification election at Filsystems, Inc., including SAMAFIL-NAFLU-KMU as a contending union.

**Liabilities:**

*   No specific monetary liabilities assigned. However, the respondent company's interference in the union election process is explicitly criticized and could invite further scrutiny.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Employer Interference:** Employer's opposition to the union election may be perceived as interference, potentially leading to Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges under the Labor Code.
*   **CBA Validity:** The CBA executed between FWU and Filsystems, Inc. could be challenged as premature and non-binding on SAMAFIL, creating labor unrest and potentially impacting the validity of the agreement.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code:** Articles 212(h), 257, Section 3, Rule II, and Sections 4 & 10, Rule V, Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code.
*   **Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Secretary of Labor and Employment, 247 SCRA 1 [1995]; San Miguel Foods, Inc. - Cebu B-Meg Feed Plant v. Laguesma, 263 SCRA 68 [1996]:** These cases support the right of independently registered labor unions to file for certification elections.
*   **Adamson & Adamson, Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations, 127 SCRA 268 [1984]; St. Luke's Medical Center, Inc. v. Torres, 223 SCRA 779 [1993]; Pambansang Kapatiran ng mga Anak Pawis sa Formey Plastic National Workers Brotherhood v. Secretary of Labor, 253 SCRA 96 [1996]:** These cases affirm the local union's independence from its federation.
*   **Associated Labor Unions (ALU-TUCP) v. Trajano 172 SCRA 49, 58 [1989]; Associated Labor Unions (ALU) v. Ferrer-Calleja, 179 SCRA 127 [1989]; Samahan ng Mangagawa sa Pacific Plastic v. Laguesma, 267 SCRA 303 [1997]:** These cases reinforce that prematurely renewed CBAs do not bar certification elections.
*   **Consolidated Farms, Inc. II v. Noriel, 84 SCRA 469, 473-475 [1978]; Phil. Telegraph and Telephone Corp. v. Laguesma, 223 SCRA 452 [1993]; Barbizon Philippines, Inc. v. Nagkakaisang Supervisor ng Barbizon Philippines, Inc. - NAFLU, 261 SCRA 738 [1996]:** These cases discourage employer interference in union selection.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The interpretation of Section 3, Rule II of the Implementing Rules of Book V of the Labor Code regarding the requirements for affiliated unions. The Supreme Court clarifies that failure to comply with these requirements does not invalidate the union's independent registration.
*   The status of the CBA entered into between FWU and Filsystems, Inc. The Supreme Court effectively deems it invalid due to the pending representation case.

**Overall, the ruling emphasizes the right of an independently registered union to seek a certification election and prevents premature CBAs from circumventing this right. It also warns against employer interference in the union selection process.**
