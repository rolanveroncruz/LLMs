**Legal Document Summary: People v. Lazaro (G.R. No. 229219)**

**Case Summary:** The Supreme Court (SC) reversed the Court of Appeals' (CA) decision and acquitted Roderick Lazaro of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs) due to the prosecution's failure to establish an unbroken chain of custody and non-compliance with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165:**  Defines and penalizes the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, requiring proof of (1) identity of buyer/seller, object and consideration, and (2) delivery and payment.
*   **Section 21, R.A. No. 9165 (as it stood prior to R.A. No. 10640):**  Mandates specific procedures for the custody and disposition of seized drugs, requiring immediate inventory and photography in the presence of (1) the accused or his representative, (2) a media representative, (3) a DOJ representative, and (4) an elected public official. All four must sign the inventory.
*   **Burden of Proof:** The prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, including the identity and integrity of the seized drug (corpus delicti). They must establish an unbroken chain of custody.

**Liabilities & Penalties:**

*   Violation of Section 5 carries a penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Php 500,000 to Php 10,000,000.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Chain of Custody Gaps:** The SC found substantial gaps in the chain of custody due to the police officers' failure to justify the absence of the required witnesses (media, DOJ, and elected public official) during the inventory. The Court emphasized that merely marking the seized item is not sufficient.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21:** The failure to comply with the requirements of Section 21, without justifiable grounds, undermines the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.
*   **Presumption of Regularity:** The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty does not apply when there are unjustified lapses and deviations from the procedure outlined in Section 21.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), Section 5 and Section 21**
*   **R.A. No. 10640:** Amended Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 (but not applicable as the offense occurred before the amendment).
*   **People v. Mendoza, 736 Phil. 749 (2014):**  Emphasizes the importance of the presence of witnesses to prevent tampering.
*   **People v. Relato, 679 Phil. 268 (2012):**  Discusses the burden of the State to prove the corpus delicti and the impact of substantial gaps in the chain of custody.
*   **People v. Umipang, 686 Phil. 1024 (2012):**  Addresses minor deviations versus gross disregard of procedural safeguards.
*   **People v. Hilario, G.R. No. 210610 (2018):** Reinforces the Constitutional presumption of innocence.

**Contentious Clauses & Arguments:**

*   The CA argued that there was substantial compliance with the chain of custody and that the lack of inventory did not affect the admissibility of evidence.
*   The SC disagreed, emphasizing that *full* compliance is required unless justifiable grounds for non-compliance are proven.

**Key Takeaway for Lawyers:**

This case highlights the critical importance of strict adherence to Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 in drug cases. Failure to fully comply, including securing the presence of required witnesses during inventory and photography, and failure to document *and justify* any deviations, will likely result in acquittal due to reasonable doubt regarding the integrity of the corpus delicti. The prosecution must prove compliance beyond a reasonable doubt; the presumption of regularity will not suffice if procedures are ignored.
