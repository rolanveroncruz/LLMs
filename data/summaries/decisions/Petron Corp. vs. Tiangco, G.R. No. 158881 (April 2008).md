## Legal Document Summary: Petron Corporation vs. Mayor Tiangco

**Case:** Petron Corporation vs. Mayor Tiangco, G.R. No. 158881, April 16, 2008

**Issue:** Whether a local government unit (LGU) can impose business taxes on entities engaged in the sale of petroleum products, specifically diesel fuel.

**Key Provisions & Arguments:**

*   **Petron's Argument:** Navotas assessed business taxes on Petron's sale of diesel fuel at its Navotas depot, referencing Ordinance 92-03. Petron argues it's exempt under:
    *   Art. 232(h) of the Implementing Rules (IRR) of the Local Government Code (LGC), which prohibits local taxes on businesses engaged in the sale of petroleum products.
    *   A Bureau of Local Government Finance ruling stating sales of petroleum fuels are not subject to local taxation.
    *   Section 133(h) of the LGC
*   **Navotas' Argument:** The municipality argues that it has the power to impose business taxes under Section 143 of the LGC and argues that the phrase "taxes, fees or charges on petroleum products" pertains to the imposition of direct or excise taxes on petroleum products, and not business taxes.
*   **RTC Decision:** The Regional Trial Court (RTC) dismissed Petron's complaint, ruling the LGU can impose business taxes, declaring Art. 232(h) of the IRR invalid because the LGC doesn't explicitly prohibit taxes on petroleum products.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court reversed the RTC decision, ruling in favor of Petron.

**Key Holdings & Reasoning:**

1.  **Section 133(h) of the LGC Prohibits Business Taxes on Petroleum:** The SC found that Section 133(h) of the LGC explicitly prohibits local government units from imposing *any* "taxes, fees or charges on petroleum products." This prohibition is not limited to excise taxes, but includes business taxes. It reasoned that if the law did not intend to prohibit business taxes, it would have qualified which types of taxes were covered under the prohibition.
2.  **Rejection of "Excise Tax" Argument:** Petron's argument that the business tax was akin to an excise tax (defined as a tax on activities) was rejected. The SC clarified that the modern definition of "excise tax" under the NIRC refers specifically to taxes on certain enumerated goods, not a tax on the activity of selling.
3.  **Invalidity of RTC's Ruling on IRR Art. 232(h):** Because the SC found that Section 133(h) *does* prohibit business taxes on petroleum, the RTC's declaration that IRR Art. 232(h) was invalid because the Code does not contain a provision prohibiting the imposition of business taxes on petroleum products was also invalid. IRR Art. 232(h) merely reiterates the Code's prohibition.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Local Government Code (LGC):** Sections 5, 133(h), 143.
*   **National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC):** Sections 141-151
*   **Republic Act No. 8180:** Oil Deregulation Law

**Case Law:**

*   *Cordero v. Conda, Allied Thread Co. Inc. v. City Mayor of Manila, Iloilo Bottlers, Inc. v. City of Iloilo:* Cited by Petron for the traditional definition of "excise tax."
*   *Philippine Petroleum Corporation v. Municipality of Pililia:* Cited by Navotas, but distinguished by the SC due to the absence of a similar prohibition to LGC Sec. 133(h) at the time of the Pililia case.
*   *City Government of San Pablo v. Reyes:* Cited to demonstrate the policy of liberally construing statutory provisions on municipal fiscal powers in favor of municipal corporations.
*   *Province of Bulacan v. Court of Appeals:* The court referred to the traditional definition of "excise tax," however, this was not explicitly carried over into the NIRC

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   While the court clearly prohibits any "taxes, fees, or charges" on petroleum products, the precise scope of "petroleum products" could be subject to future litigation.
*   The long-term economic impact of prohibiting local taxes on petroleum products could be debated, as it might limit the revenue-generating capacity of LGUs.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court definitively held that LGUs are barred by Section 133(h) of the LGC from imposing business taxes, fees, or charges on petroleum products. This decision clarifies the limits of local fiscal autonomy concerning petroleum and resolves the conflicting interpretations of relevant provisions of the LGC.
