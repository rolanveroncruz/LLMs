**Case Summary: China Banking Corporation vs. Spouses Lozada, G.R. No. 164919, July 4, 2008**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the Court of Appeals' decision annulling the RTC's Order granting CBC an ex parte writ of possession over a condominium unit (Unit 402) previously mortgaged by the developer (PPGI).

**Facts:** Spouses Lozada entered into a Contract to Sell with PPGI for Unit 402. PPGI subsequently mortgaged the Project, including Unit 402, to CBC. PPGI defaulted, CBC foreclosed, and acquired title to the unit. CBC then filed an ex parte petition for a writ of possession. The CA reversed the RTC's grant of the writ, holding that the spouses Lozada were holding the property adversely and were denied due process. Spouses Lozada also filed a case with the HLURB seeking to annul the mortgage.

**Key Provisions & Issues:**

*   **Act No. 3135, Section 7:** Governs extrajudicial foreclosure and the purchaser's right to a writ of possession. Generally, issuance of the writ is ministerial and ex parte after consolidation of title (IFC Service Leasing and Acceptance Corporation v. Nera).
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 33 (formerly Section 35):** Allows possession to the purchaser unless a third party is holding the property *adversely* to the judgment debtor.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957, Section 18:** Regulates mortgages by developers. Requires HLURB approval and notification to buyers.
*   **Main Issue:** Whether the spouses Lozada's possession was adverse to PPGI, thus precluding an ex parte writ of possession.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court GRANTED the petition, reversing the CA decision and reinstating the RTC order. The Court held that the spouses Lozada were not adverse possessors, but successors-in-interest to PPGI by virtue of their Contract to Sell, which pre-dated the mortgage. Consequently, CBC was entitled to an ex parte writ of possession.

**Rationale:**

*   The ex parte issuance of a writ of possession is generally ministerial post-foreclosure (Act No. 3135), unless a third party is in *adverse* possession (Rule 39, Section 33).
*   The spouses Lozada's possession stemmed from the Contract to Sell with PPGI. Their rights were derived from PPGI, not independent of it. They were not in possession by adverse title (e.g., co-owner, tenant, usufructuary).
*   The Supreme Court distinguishes this case from China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Ordinario, where the court did not directly resolve the nature of the possession of the foreclosed property by the spouses Ordinario.
*   The SC noted that the annulment of the mortgage would not alter the nature of Lozada's possession to make it adverse to PPGI.
*   The SC held that a Status Quo Order by HLURB cannot interfere with the issuance or enforcement of a writ of possession issued by the Makati City RTC.
*   Since the Lozadas' claim regarding the validity of the mortgage under PD 957 was pending before HLURB, the SC refrained from ruling on the matter, applying the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction.
*    The lower court erred in the application of Union Bank of the Philippines v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities:**

*   **HLURB Proceeding:** The spouses Lozada's HLURB case remains unresolved. A successful challenge there could potentially lead to a claim against CBC for damages.
*   **PD 957 Violation:** The unresolved HLURB case could determine whether PPGI violated PD 957.
*   **Due Process Argument:** The Lozadas may continue to argue that the summary procedure deprived them of due process.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Act No. 3135:** Extrajudicial Foreclosure Law.
*   **Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Section 33:** Execution of Judgments.
*   **Presidential Decree No. 957:** Subdivision and Condominium Buyer's Protective Decree.
*   **Union Bank of the Philippines v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board:** Jurisprudence on PD 957 requirements for mortgages.
*   **IFC Service Leasing and Acceptance Corporation v. Nera:**  Jurisprudence about issuance of Writ of Possession.
*   **Roxas v. Buan:**  Case on nature of possession when a third party holds the property.
*    **China Banking Corporation v. Spouses Ordinario:** Adverse Claim of the Spouses.

**Conclusion:** This case reinforces the purchaser's right to an ex parte writ of possession after foreclosure, absent true adverse possession. However, the pending HLURB case regarding potential violations of PD 957 presents a potential risk for CBC. Further, the spouses Lozada may challenge the actions based on due process concerns.
