**Case Summary: URSUMCO vs. Caballeda and Cadalin (G.R. No. 156644, July 28, 2008)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether the respondents' retirement was voluntary or tantamount to illegal dismissal due to compulsory retirement, and the applicability of RA 7641.

**Facts:**

*   Agripino Caballeda (welder) and Alejandro Cadalin (crane operator) were employees of Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation (URSUMCO).
*   URSUMCO issued a memorandum on compulsory retirement at age 60.
*   RA 7641, amending the Labor Code, took effect on January 7, 1993, providing for retirement pay in the absence of a retirement plan, setting 65 as compulsory retirement age.
*   A Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between URSUMCO and the National Federation of Labor (NFL) stated that retirement benefits would be "in accordance with law."
*   Respondents were allegedly forced to retire at age 60. Both accepted separation/retirement pay, and Cadalin executed a quitclaim.
*   They subsequently filed complaints for illegal dismissal, underpayment of retirement benefits, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **URSUMCO Memorandum:** Imposed compulsory retirement at age 60.
*   **RA 7641 (Amending Art. 287 of the Labor Code):** Establishes 65 as the compulsory retirement age and provides for retirement pay.
*   **CBA:**  Stipulates retirement benefits to be "in accordance with law," arguably incorporating RA 7641.
*   **Quitclaim (Cadalin):**  A potential waiver of claims, subject to scrutiny for voluntariness and fairness.

**Court Holdings:**

1.  **Retroactivity of RA 7641:** The Supreme Court held that RA 7641 applies retroactively if (1) the claimant was still employed when the statute took effect and (2) the claimant met the eligibility requirements under the statute. (Cited *Enriquez Security Services, Inc. v. Cabotaje*). These conditions were satisfied here.

2.  **Agripino's Employment Status:** The Supreme Court affirmed the factual finding of the Labor Arbiter (LA), the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), and the Court of Appeals (CA) that Agripino was a regular employee, not a seasonal/project employee.

3.  **Voluntariness of Retirement:** The Court ruled that the respondents' retirement was *not* voluntary but forced, amounting to illegal dismissal.
    *   Cited *Lopez Sugar Corporation v. Federation of Free Workers*:  Highlights the unequal footing between employer and employee regarding quitclaims.
    *   The Court found that URSUMCO failed to prove the requisites for a valid quitclaim: voluntariness, absence of fraud, reasonable consideration, and consistency with law/public policy.  It emphasized that the employer bears the burden of proof.
    *   The Court considered that respondents were rank-and-file employees subject to pressure and that the filing of the illegal dismissal complaints indicated a lack of intent to relinquish employment.

**Liabilities:**

*   URSUMCO is liable to pay:
    *   Retirement benefit differentials to Alejandro Cadalin.
    *   Retirement benefits to Agripino Caballeda.
    *   Backwages to both respondents from the date of their forced retirement up to 2002 (per CA).

**Potential Risks/Contentious Issues:**

*   **Validity of the Quitclaim:** Even with the finding of illegal dismissal, the presence of the quitclaim signed by Cadalin could have been a point of contention, had the court not clearly defined the requisites and burdens involved.
*   **Interpretation of the CBA:** The ambiguous phrase "in accordance with law" opened the door for debate.
*   **Agripino's Employment Status:** The finding that Agripino was a regular employee was crucial, and a different factual determination would have significantly altered the outcome.
*   **Backwages Award:** Ordering backwages up to 2002 without specifying a reinstatement order could have posed compliance issues. The precise calculation of backwages is crucial.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Labor Code, Article 287 (as amended by RA 7641):** Retirement provisions.
