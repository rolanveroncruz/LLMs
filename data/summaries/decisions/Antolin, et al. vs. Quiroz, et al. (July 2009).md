## Legal Document Summary: A.M. No. RTJ-09-2186 & RTJ-09-2187

**Nature:** Consolidated administrative complaints against Judge Alex L. Quiroz and Sheriffs Edwin V. Garrobo and Mario Pangilinan (deceased) arising from the issuance and implementation of a Writ of Execution in Civil Case No. 59264.

**Key Provisions & Allegations:**

*   **RTJ-09-2186 (Antolin & Trillana v. Quiroz, Garrobo, & Pangilinan):** Complainant attorneys allege Judge Quiroz improperly issued a Writ of Execution against Philips Semiconductors Philippines, Inc. (PSPI) as a subsidiary of Signetics despite a pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Court of Appeals' decision directing execution against PSPI.  They further allege Sheriffs Garrobo and Pangilinan acted unlawfully in implementing the writ, ignoring their arguments and a motion to set aside the execution order.
*   **RTJ-09-2187 (Garrobo v. Quiroz):** Sheriff Garrobo alleges Judge Quiroz berated and threatened him for serving the writ on PSPI. Judge Quiroz counter-alleges Garrobo accepted money from the plaintiff (Fruehauf) prejudicing the implementation of the writ.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Quiroz:** Alleged failure to adhere to procedural rules regarding finality of judgments and proper motion requirements before issuing the writ.
*   **Sheriffs Garrobo & Pangilinan:**  Alleged failure to exercise discretion and disregard legal arguments presented against the validity of the writ implementation. The general obligation of sheriffs to promptly execute valid writs is acknowledged, citing *Alvarez v. Diaz, et. al., A.M. No. MTJ-00-1283*.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Timing of Execution:**  The core issue revolves around whether the CA decision was final and executory at the time of the writ's issuance and implementation. The pending motion for reconsideration introduces ambiguity.
*   **Sheriff's Discretion:** While sheriffs generally have a ministerial duty to execute writs, the attorneys argue the sheriffs should have recognized the execution was invalid given pending motions. This raises the question of the extent to which sheriffs must assess the legality of a facially valid writ.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The case relies heavily on the credibility of the parties and witnesses. The investigating judge dismissed one witness as "bias and prejudiced."
*   **Corruption allegations:** Judge Quiroz accused Sheriff Garrobo for accepting money from plaintiff.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 39, Sec. 1 (Rules of Civil Procedure):** Allegedly requires entry of judgment before execution.  The document disputes this interpretation, asserting only a certified copy is required.
*   **Alvarez v. Diaz, et. al., A.M. No. MTJ-00-1283:** Cited to affirm a sheriff's duty to execute writs promptly.

**Outcome:**

The Supreme Court dismissed all complaints:

*   Complaint against Judge Quiroz in RTJ-09-2186 was dismissed based on the availability of judicial remedies.
*   Complaint against Sheriffs Garrobo and Pangilinan in RTJ-09-2186 was dismissed, stating the sheriffs had a ministerial duty to execute the writ absent a restraining order.
*   Complaint filed by Sheriff Garrobo against Judge Alex L. Quiroz, as well as the counter-charge, in RTJ-09-2187 was dismissed, concluding that neither party presented sufficient evidence to support their claims.
