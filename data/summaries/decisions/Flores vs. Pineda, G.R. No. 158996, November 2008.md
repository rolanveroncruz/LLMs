## Legal Document Summary: *Spouses Flores vs. Spouses Pineda*, G.R. No. 158996

**Nature:** Medical Negligence Appeal by Certiorari under Rule 45, assailing CA decision affirming RTC judgment.

**Key Issue:** Whether the D&C operation performed on Teresita Pineda by the petitioner spouses (Dr. Fredelicto and Dr. Felicisima Flores) constituted medical negligence, resulting in her death.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court affirmed the CA decision finding the petitioner spouses liable for medical negligence.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Duty of Care:** Physicians have a duty to provide the standard of care expected of a reasonably competent doctor under similar circumstances (citing *Reyes v. Sisters of Mercy Hospital*). This includes pre-operative evaluation and considering foreseeable harm.
*   **Breach of Duty:** The Court found a breach of duty in proceeding with a D&C operation despite:
    *   Prior suspicion and symptoms of diabetes
    *   Elevated blood sugar levels revealed in preliminary laboratory results
    *   Failure to wait for complete lab results before proceeding
    *   Failure to refer to or consult with an internist/diabetologist prior to the operation
    *   Inadequate pre-operative evaluation of patient, specifically for diabetes (deviation from *Sabiston Textbook of Surgery* standards).
*   **Causation:** The court found a causal connection between the negligent conduct and Teresita's death.  The D&C aggravated her hyperglycemic state, leading to septicemic shock and ketoacidosis, ultimately causing cardiorespiratory arrest (as per the death certificate). *Gordon French, MD, Clinical Management of Diabetes Mellitus During Anesthesia and Surgery* supports the notion that stress, particularly surgical stress, can aggravate hyperglycemia.

**Liabilities:**

*   The Supreme Court affirmed the finding of joint and several liability for:
    *   **Actual damages:**  P36,000.00
    *   **Moral damages:** P400,000.00
    *   **Exemplary damages:** P100,000.00 (to deter similar medical malpractice)
    *   **Attorney's fees:** P100,000.00.
*   **Death Indemnity:** Added P50,000.00 death indemnity citing Article 2206 of the Civil Code.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 2206 of the Civil Code:** Damages for death caused by quasi-delict.
*   **Article 2199 of the Civil Code:**  Entitlement to compensation for proven pecuniary loss.
*   **Article 2229 of the Civil Code:** Exemplary damages.
*   **Article 2208 (2) of the Civil Code:**  Grant of attorney's fees.

**Case Law References:**

*   *Reyes v. Sisters of Mercy Hospital*: Elements of medical negligence.
*   *Professional Services, Inc. v. Agana*: Burden of proof in medical negligence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Subjectivity in "Reasonable Prudence":** The application of "reasonable prudence" is always fact-dependent and can be subject to interpretation.  The doctors argued their actions were based on professional judgment, but the court sided with expert testimony highlighting the risk of the procedure in light of potential diabetes.
*   **Reliance on Medical Records:** The Court placed significant weight on the *absence* of a notation regarding profuse bleeding in the medical records. This highlights the importance of accurate and comprehensive record-keeping in defending against malpractice claims.
*   **Role of the Anesthesiologist:** The Court criticized Dr. Fredelicto's involvement in the decision to proceed with the D&C, arguing that if he lacked the expertise to treat diabetes or perform the gynecological procedure, he should have refrained from participating in the decision-making process.

**Summary of Negligence:** The Floreses were found negligent because, with a reasonable suspicion of Diabetes Mellitus Type II, they did not postpone or delay surgery, did not fully test for, and did not consult an internist to control the patient's diabetic issues prior to the D&C. Further, they failed to note the heavy bleeding in the medical record. Because of this negligence, it was improper for surgery to occur, which lead to the death of the patient.
