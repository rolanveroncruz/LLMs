**Case Summary: *Joselito Musni Puno v. Puno Enterprises, Inc.* (G.R. No. 177066, September 11, 2009)**

**Legal Issue:** Whether an individual claiming to be an heir of a deceased stockholder is entitled to inspect the corporate books and receive dividends of a corporation without establishing filiation and having the stock transferred in the corporate books.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court held that the petitioner, Joselito Musni Puno, failed to establish his right to inspect the respondent corporation's books and receive dividends because he failed to prove his filiation to the deceased stockholder, Carlos L. Puno, and the transfer of shares was not recorded in the corporate books.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sections 74 and 75 of the Corporation Code:** Defines the right of stockholders to inspect corporate books and receive financial statements. These rights are predicated on *ownership* of shares.
*   **Section 63 of the Corporation Code:** Governs the transfer of stocks, stating that no transfer is valid except between the parties until recorded in the corporate books. This is crucial as it dictates when an heir actually becomes a stockholder *of record*.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Corporation's Liability:** The corporation is only liable to allow inspection and provide dividends to stockholders of record.
*   **Heir's Risk:** An heir risks dismissal of actions seeking stockholder rights if they cannot establish filiation to the deceased and/or the transfer of shares to their name in the corporate books. An ordinary civil action cannot establish heirship.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Corporation Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 68), Sections 63, 74, 75:** Crucial statutory basis for stockholders' rights and transfer of shares.
*   ***Gokongwei, Jr. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 178 Phil. 266, 314 (1979):*** Discusses the underlying ownership of corporate assets as the basis for inspection rights.
*   ***Cabatania v. Court of Appeals, 484 Phil. 42, 51 (2004):*** Clarifies that a birth certificate is not competent evidence of paternity if the putative father did not participate in its preparation.
*   ***Joaquino v. Reyes, G.R. No. 154645, July 13, 2004, 434 SCRA 260, 274:*** Stipulates the requirement to pursue heirship determination in a special proceeding, not an ordinary civil action.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The document does not identify particular instances of ambiguities or contentious clauses within the articles of incorporation or by-laws of Puno Enterprises, Inc. The central contention revolves around the *proof* of heirship and the proper *venue* for establishing it. The core issue concerns the application of established legal principles concerning inheritance and corporate law to the specific facts.

**Legal Precision Summary:**

The case underscores the principle that heirship must be formally established in a separate special proceeding (settlement of estate) before an heir can assert rights as a stockholder in a corporation. The decision clarifies that a certificate of live birth is insufficient proof of filiation absent acknowledgement or participation of the putative father. Furthermore, it emphasizes the legal significance of Section 63 of the Corporation Code: shares are not legally transferred for purposes of exercising corporate rights until recorded in the corporation's books. Thus, heirs initially hold only equitable title, with legal title vested in the estate's administrator/executor. The proper remedy is to participate in estate proceedings, obtain a judicial declaration of heirship, and secure the transfer of shares recorded in the corporate books. Failure to do so prevents the assertion of stockholder rights under Sections 74 and 75 of the Corporation Code.
