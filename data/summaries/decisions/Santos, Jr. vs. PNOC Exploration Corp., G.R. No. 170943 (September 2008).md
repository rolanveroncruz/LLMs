## Legal Document Summary: Santos v. PNOC Exploration Corp.

**Case Citation:** 587 Phil. 713 (G.R. No. 170943, September 23, 2008)

**Nature:** Petition for Review of Court of Appeals decision upholding RTC orders in a collection suit.

**Key Issue:** Validity of service by publication in an action *in personam*, and propriety of subsequent default proceedings.

**Facts:** PNOC Exploration Corp. sued Pedro Santos, Jr. (former board member) to recover an unpaid car loan balance (P698,502.10). Personal service of summons failed. The RTC allowed service by publication in Remate. Santos failed to answer; PNOC presented evidence *ex parte*. Santos filed a motion to reconsider (Omnibus Motion), challenging the service of summons and lack of notice. The RTC denied the motion, and the CA affirmed.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **PNOC's Obligation:** To properly serve summons on Santos to establish jurisdiction.
*   **Santos's Obligation:** To repay the car loan per promissory note and chattel mortgage agreement.

**Liabilities:**

*   Santos is liable for the unpaid car loan balance (P698,502.10) plus legal interest and costs if the judgment is upheld.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Santos:** Loss of appeal, enforcement of judgment, and potential asset seizure.
*   **PNOC:** Possibility of reversal on appeal if service was deemed improper, requiring a new trial.

**Relevant Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 14, Sections 14, 19, and 20 of the Rules of Court:** Governs service of summons, particularly service by publication and voluntary appearance.
*   **Rule 9, Sections 3 and 4 of the Rules of Court:** Governs default proceedings and the rights of a defaulting party.
*   **Consolidated Plywood Industries, Inc. v. Breva, G.R. No. L-82811, 18 October 1988, 166 SCRA 519; Asiavest Limited v. Court of Appeals, 357 Phil. 536 (1998); Valmonte v. Court of Appeals, 322 Phil. 96 (1996):** Discuss prior application of substituted service to *in rem* cases under the old rule.
*   **Europa v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 72827, 18 July 1989, 175 SCRA 394:** Related to voluntary appearance.
*   **Mediserv, Inc. v. China Banking Corporation, 408 Phil. 745 (2001):** Requirements for default orders.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses/Issues:**

*   **Service by Publication in *In Personam* Action:**  The main contention revolved around whether service by publication is proper in actions *in personam* like this collection suit.  The Supreme Court found that current rules allow service by publication in any action where the defendant's whereabouts are unknown after diligent inquiry. This interpretation deviates from previous jurisprudence limiting such service to *in rem* actions under earlier versions of the Rules of Court.
*   **Affidavit of Service by Registered Mail:**  Santos argued that the affidavit showing the deposit of the summons and publication order in the post office should have been executed by the clerk of court, not PNOC's employee.  The Supreme Court clarified that the rules do not mandate this; the obligation to make the complementary service by registered mail rests with the party resorting to publication.
*   **Validity of Default:** The RTC essentially entered a default order without a formal motion to declare default.  The SC acknowledged this irregularity, pointing out that a default order requires a motion from the claiming party. However, this was not explicitly used as grounds for the denial.
*   **Voluntary Appearance:** Santos's filing of the "Omnibus Motion" was deemed a voluntary appearance, waiving any jurisdictional defects related to service. This is based on Section 20, Rule 14.

**Summary Judgment:**

The Supreme Court denied Santos's petition, upholding the CA decision. It found that service by publication was proper under the circumstances, that the affidavit of service was compliant with the rules, and that Santos had voluntarily submitted to the court's jurisdiction through his Omnibus Motion. Despite procedural irregularities concerning the default order, the Court appeared to focus on the argument that the petitioner's location was unknown, making notification impractical. While acknowledging the error, it found that the result would not change, upholding the original decision.
