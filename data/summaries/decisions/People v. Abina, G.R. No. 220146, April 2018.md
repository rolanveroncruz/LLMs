## Legal Document Summary: People v. Abina & Latorre, G.R. No. 220146

**Nature:** Criminal Appeal of a CA Decision affirming the RTC Joint Judgment finding Glen Abina and the now deceased Jesus Latorre guilty of Murder and Homicide. The Supreme Court (SC) partially affirmed the CA decision.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Original Charges:** Glen and Jesus were charged with two counts of Murder for the deaths of Anthony Asadon and Rodolfo Mabag under separate Informations alleging conspiracy and treachery.
*   **RTC & CA Findings:** Both the RTC and CA found Glen and Jesus guilty of Murder (Anthony Asadon) and Homicide (Rodolfo Mabag). They rejected the defense of denial and the belated claim of self-defense as inconsistent and unsupported by evidence. Both courts determined the killing of Anthony was qualified by treachery.
*   **SC Ruling:** The SC affirmed Glen's culpability but *modified* the conviction for the killing of Anthony Asadon from Murder to **Homicide**. The Court reasoned that the prosecution failed to prove treachery beyond reasonable doubt, despite the suddenness of the attack. The attack location and time were not conducive to a no-risk strategy for the assailant, meaning Glen did not consciously employ the method of attack to avoid retaliation.
*   **Rationale:** The SC cited Article 14(16) of the Revised Penal Code defining treachery and relied on *People v. Vilbar* (680 Phil. 767), *Rustia, Jr. v. People* (G.R. No. 208351), and *People v. Calinawan* (G.R. No. 226145) to reiterate that treachery cannot be presumed and must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The mere suddenness or unexpectedness of an attack is insufficient.
*   **Sentence:** The SC sentenced Glen to an indeterminate penalty of 7 years and 4 months of *prision mayor* (minimum) to 17 years and 4 months of *reclusion temporal* (maximum) for each count of homicide.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Glen Abina is liable for two counts of Homicide.
*   **Civil Liability:** Glen Abina is ordered to pay the respective heirs of Anthony Asadon and Rodolfo Mabag:
    *   P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for death;
    *   P50,000.00 as moral damages;
    *   P50,000.00 as temperate damages.
*   **Interest:** All damages awarded shall earn interest of 6% per annum from finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Lack of Treachery Proof:** The SC decision highlights the stringent requirements for proving treachery, emphasizing that suddenness alone is insufficient. The court's decision underscores that the prosecution bears a heavy burden to demonstrably prove a deliberate strategy on the part of the assailant to negate any risk of defense.
*   **Self-Defense Issue:** The defense's conflicting strategies (denial and self-defense) were detrimental to the appeal. The court emphasized that claiming self-defense implies admission of guilt, shifting the burden to the accused to demonstrate unlawful aggression.
*   **Sentencing Discretion:** The SC, in applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, retains some discretion in determining the specific minimum and maximum terms of the sentence, influenced by the absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code: Art. 14(16) (Treachery), Art. 249 (Homicide)
*   Indeterminate Sentence Law
