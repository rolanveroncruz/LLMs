## Legal Document Summary: *Cadimas v. Carrion and Hugo*, G.R. No. 180394

This case involves a *petition for review on certiorari* of a Court of Appeals decision that reversed the RTC's denial of a motion to dismiss and ordered the dismissal of a complaint for *accion reivindicatoria* and damages due to lack of jurisdiction.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Contract to Sell:** Petitioner (Cadimas) and Respondent (Carrion) entered into a Contract to Sell a townhouse.
*   **Breach Allegation:** Cadimas alleges Carrion breached the contract by transferring ownership to Hugo via a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) without Cadimas's consent, violating a clause prohibiting transfer of rights without consent.
*   **Action:** Cadimas filed an action for *accion reivindicatoria* and damages in the RTC, seeking cancellation of the contract and recovery of possession.
*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** Respondents argued the HLURB, not the RTC, had jurisdiction, claiming the dispute involved unsound real estate practices under PD 957 and PD 1344. They asserted that the sole issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner, as the owner and developer of the subdivision on which the subject property stood, was guilty of committing unsound real estate business practices.
*   **Default & Answer:** Carrion was initially declared in default, but the order was later lifted. Hugo filed an answer (as Carrion's attorney-in-fact) with a compulsory counterclaim.
*   **Court of Appeals Ruling:** The CA reversed the RTC, holding that the HLURB had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, considering that the property subject thereof was part of a subdivision project.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Supreme court ruled that the RTC has jurisdiction over the case because the complaint involves the breach of a contract to sell of a townhouse.

**Key Obligations:**

*   Carrion's obligation under the Contract to Sell not to transfer rights without Cadimas's consent.
*   Cadimas's obligation to convey title upon full payment, as typically implied in a Contract to Sell.

**Potential Liabilities:**

*   Carrion: Potential liability for breach of contract and damages.
*   Hugo: Potential liability if found to have wrongfully taken possession of the property.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Jurisdictional Ambiguity:** The main issue is whether the dispute falls under the HLURB's jurisdiction (PD 957/1344) or the RTC's general jurisdiction. This depends on the nature of the action as determined by the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought, and whether the property is considered a subdivision lot.
*   **Validity of SPA:** The validity and scope of the Special Power of Attorney granted to Hugo by Carrion could be challenged.
*   **Compulsory Counterclaim:** The filing of a compulsory counterclaim by the respondent in the RTC could be interpreted as submission to the RTC's jurisdiction.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **PD 957 (Subdivision and Condominium Buyers' Protective Decree):** Pertains to the regulation of real estate trade and business.
*   **PD 1344:** Expands the jurisdiction of the National Housing Authority (now HLURB). Section 1 enumerates specific cases under the HLURB's jurisdiction, particularly those involving unsound real estate practices, claims by buyers against developers, and specific performance.
*   ***Laresma v. Abellana***: Jurisdiction is conferred by law, not by consent or waiver.
*   ***Antipolo Realty Corp. v. National Housing Authority***:  HLURB jurisdiction over controversies regarding rights under a contract to sell a subdivision lot.
*   ***Javellana v. Hon. Presiding Judge, RTC, Branch 30, Manila***: Affirmed the jurisdiction of the RTC over the complaint for accion publiciana and sum of money on the ground that the complaint did not allege that the subject lot was part of a subdivision project but that the sale was an ordinary sale on an installment basis.
*   ***Roxas v. Court of Appeals***: The logical complainants would be the buyers and customers against the sellers (subdivision owners and developers or condominium builders and realtors), and not vice versa.
*   ***Spouses Dela Cruz v. Court of Appeals***: the Court upheld the jurisdiction of the RTC over the complaint for cancellation of the contract to sell of a subdivision house and lot because the case did not fall under any of the cases mentioned in Section 1, P.D. No. 1344.

**Legal Advice:**

*   Argue strongly that the complaint's allegations focus on breach of contract and *accion reivindicatoria*, not on unsound real estate practices as defined by PD 957/1344.
*   Cite case law emphasizing that jurisdiction is determined by the complaint's allegations, not the defenses raised.
*   If applicable, argue that the respondents have submitted to the RTC's jurisdiction by filing an answer with a compulsory counterclaim.
*   Highlight that the petitioner is not a subdivision lot buyer and that the contract to sell did not contain clauses which would indicate that petitioner has obligations in the capacity of a subdivision lot developer, owner or broker or salesman or a person engaged in real estate business.
