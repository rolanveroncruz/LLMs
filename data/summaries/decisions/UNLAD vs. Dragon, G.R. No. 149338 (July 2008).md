## Legal Document Summary: *Unlad Resources Development Corporation v. Dragon, G.R. No. 149338*

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari challenging the CA decision affirming the RTC's rescission of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and awarding damages.

**Parties:**

*   **Petitioners:** Unlad Resources Development Corporation, et al. (Unlad Resources)
*   **Respondents:** Renato P. Dragon, et al. (Original Controlling Stockholders of Rural Bank)

**Key Provisions of the MOA (December 29, 1981):**

*   Respondents to allow Unlad Resources to invest P4.8M in Rural Bank in the form of equity.
*   Unlad Resources to subscribe to minimum P4.8M common/preferred non-voting shares, paying P1.2M immediately.
*   Respondents to transfer control and management of Rural Bank to Unlad Resources upon signing.
*   A contract of lease was entered into with Helena Z. Benitez as lessor of a mango plantation. The management of the mango plantation was undertaken by Unlad Commodities, Inc., a subsidiary of Unlad Resources[,] under a Management Contract Agreement. The Management Contract provides that Unlad Commodities, Inc. would receive eighty percent (80%) of the net profits generated by the operation of the mango plantation while the Bank's share is twenty percent (20%).

**Alleged Breach:**

*   Respondents claim they transferred control but Unlad Resources failed to invest P4.8M and immediately infuse P1.2M.

**Procedural History:**

*   RTC: Rescinded the MOA, ordered Unlad Resources to return control of the bank, return P1,003,070 to Unlad Resources, enjoined subscription to retired DBP shares, and awarded damages to respondents (P4,601,765.38 actual, P500,000 moral, P100,000 exemplary, P100,000 attorney's fees).
*   CA: Affirmed the RTC decision.

**Petitioners' Arguments:**

1.  **Lack of Jurisdiction:** Claims issues are intra-corporate and SEC (now RTC per RA 8799) should have jurisdiction (citing PD 902-A).
2.  **Prescription:** Argues action for rescission prescribed under Article 1389 of the Civil Code (4 years).
3.  **Impossibility of Performance:** Claims they couldn't subscribe to the shares because Rural Bank's capital stock was insufficient.
4.  **Lack of Restitution:** Argues rescission requires restitution of all contributions/investments.
5.  **Improper Damages:** Assails moral, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees as lacking factual and legal basis.

**Respondents' Arguments:**

*   They complied with their obligations.
*   Unlad Resources mismanaged and dissipated bank assets, engaging in activities outside the scope of rural banking, and using bank assets for personal gain (e.g., Mango Plantation Lease).
*   Jurisdiction lies with RTC and Petitioners are estopped by laches (citing *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy*).
*   Article 1144 (10-year prescription) applies, not Article 1389.
*   Damages award is justified.

**Court's Holding:**

*   Petition DENIED; CA affirmed.
*   **Jurisdiction:**  RTC has jurisdiction.  Regardless of whether it's intra-corporate or contractual, jurisdiction now lies with the RTC under RA 8799 (Securities Regulation Code), transferring jurisdiction previously held by the SEC under PD 902-A. *Tijam v. Sibonghanoy* on estoppel by laches is irrelevant due to this ruling.
*   **Prescription:** Article 1144 applies (action on a written contract - 10 years), not Article 1389 (rescissible contracts).
*   **Rescission:** Unlad Resources failed to perform under the MOA. Mutual restitution is required. Court upholds mutual restitution ordered by the RTC
*   **Damages:**

    *   *Actual Damages:* Upheld, based on evidence presented showing losses incurred due to Unlad Resources' breach. Petitioners also did not object to this specific damage assessment in its Appellants’ Brief.
    *   *Moral Damages:* Upheld, based on the trial court’s findings regarding the director’s mismanagement of the company, in bad faith to the detriment of the stockholders.
    *   *Exemplary Damages:* Upheld, as justified by the award of moral damages.
    *   *Attorney's Fees:* Upheld, as justified by the award of exemplary damages (Civil Code, Art. 2208).

**Potential Risks and Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Valuation of Damages:** The determination of actual damages and the causal link between the breach and the losses could be challenged in a subsequent proceeding.
*   **Restitution:** The practical implications of restoring the parties to their original positions could be complex, particularly regarding the current financial state of the Rural Bank.
*   **Fiduciary Duty of Directors:** The case highlights the fiduciary duties of corporate directors and potential liability for mismanagement and self-dealing, particularly concerning the lease of the mango plantation and Central Bank circular violations.
