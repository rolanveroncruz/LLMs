**Case Summary: Vitug v. Dimagiba, A.M. No. P-02-1605, February 04, 2008**

**Nature of the Case:** Disciplinary action against a Sheriff (Perlito G. Dimagiba) for dereliction of duty.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Sections 9 and 14, Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (as amended):** These are the central statutory references.  Section 9 deals with return of service, while Section 14 pertains to the sheriff's duty regarding execution of the writ and required reports (specifically notices of garnishment). Dimagiba failed to submit reports on service of notices of garnishment and the periodic reports (every 30 days) as mandated by Rule 39.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Simple Neglect of Duty:** The Court found Dimagiba guilty of simple neglect of duty for failing to comply with the reporting requirements outlined in Rule 39 regarding the writ of execution in Civil Case No. 173-M-97.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Repetition of Offense:** The Decision explicitly warns that a repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely. This creates a heightened risk of escalated penalties for future misconduct.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None evident from the summary. The facts seem relatively straightforward: the Sheriff failed to fulfill his reporting obligations under the Rules of Civil Procedure.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   The document itself constitutes a legal precedent. It reinforces the importance of sheriffs adhering to procedural rules and deadlines. The reference to "simple neglect of duty" links to established jurisprudence defining this offense within the context of public service and the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. (Though the specific cases are not cited here.)

**Conclusion:**

This case establishes that a sheriff's failure to properly report actions taken pursuant to a writ of execution, as required by Rule 39, constitutes simple neglect of duty. The penalty (suspension without pay for one month and warning) serves as a deterrent and underscores the importance of compliance with procedural rules. Any future similar failures by Dimagiba (or any other sheriff with knowledge of this case) would likely face harsher penalties.
