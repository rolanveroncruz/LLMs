## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Cañas* (G.R. No. 267360)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision affirming CA Decision, which affirmed with modification the RTC's conviction of Vergel Cañas for three counts of qualified trafficking in persons.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Violation:** Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act No. 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003), as amended by Republic Act No. 10364 (Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012).
*   **Elements of Trafficking (per Section 4(a)):**
    *   Act of "recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, offering, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons."
    *   Means involving "threat, or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits."
    *   Purpose includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."
*   **Qualified Trafficking:** The crime is qualified because the victim (AAA) was a child (13 years old).

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant (Cañas):**
    *   Convicted of three counts of qualified trafficking in persons.
    *   Sentenced to life imprisonment for each count.
    *   Required to pay a fine of PHP 2,000,000.00 for each count.
    *   Required to pay AAA PHP 500,000.00 as moral damages for each count.
    *   Required to pay AAA PHP 100,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count.
    *   All monetary awards subject to 6% legal interest per annum from finality of judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Inconsistencies in Victim Testimony:** The defense argued inconsistencies in AAA's judicial affidavit versus trial testimony, and inconsistencies within AAA's trial testimony itself (e.g., details about payment exchange in relation to the April 6 and April 9 incidents). *Court's response:* Affidavits are inferior to testimonies in court and inconsistencies in minor details do not destroy credibility.
*   **Defense of Denial and Alibi:** Cañas denied the accusations, claiming AAA was introduced by Alrose and that he was not involved in recruiting or exploiting her. *Court's response:*  Denial is a weak defense and cannot overcome the positive declaration of a credible witness.
*   **Accused Argument:** Alrose recruited and offered private complainant a job. It was Alrose who introduced private complainant to him, and the latter was staying in the house of Alrose. Thus, accused-appellant argues that he cannot be considered to have "brainwashed" private complainant to perform sexual services to her clients. Accordingly, accused-appellant claims that the prosecution was not able to prove that he exploited private complainant for the purpose of prostitution. *Court's response:*  The law also penalizes offering and transporting people.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   *People v. Valencia, G.R. No.234013, June 16, 2021*:  Cited for the elements of trafficking in persons.
*   *People v. XXX G.R. No. 248815, March 23, 2022*: The crime of trafficking in persons is qualified when the trafficked person is a child
*   *People v. Dayaday, 803 Phil. 363, 370-371 (2017)*: Trial court's findings on witness credibility are given great weight.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 9208 (Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003)
*   Republic Act No. 10364 (Expanded Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2012)
*   Revised Penal Code Article 266-A

**Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   None noted. The decision appears straightforward in its application of the law to the facts presented. The defense arguments, while raised, were not persuasive to the court.

**Summary of the Decision:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Vergel Cañas for three counts of qualified trafficking in persons. The prosecution sufficiently proved that Cañas recruited, offered, and transported a 13-year-old victim for the purpose of sexual exploitation, thereby satisfying all the elements of the crime under RA 9208, as amended by RA 10364.  The court rejected the defense's arguments regarding inconsistencies in the victim's testimony and the denial and alibi offered by Cañas. The penalties imposed by the lower courts were affirmed, including life imprisonment, fines, and moral and exemplary damages.
