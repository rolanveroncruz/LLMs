## Legal Document Summary - *People vs. Nepomuceno, Jr.* G.R. No. 127818

This legal document is a Supreme Court decision affirming the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Guillermo Nepomuceno, Jr. for Parricide under Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, for the death of his wife, Grace Nepomuceno.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Conviction for Parricide:** Affirms the RTC's guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Penalty:** Sentence of *reclusion perpetua* (modified from "40 years of reclusion perpetua").
*   **Civil Liability:** Orders accused-appellant to pay the heirs of the deceased Php 50,000.00 and costs.
*   **Disinheritance:** Declares accused ineligible to inherit from his wife per Article 921, paragraph (1) of the Civil Code.

**Accused's Arguments (and Court's Rebuttals):**

1.  **Accidental Killing (Exempting Circumstance Art. 12(4) RPC):** Accused claimed the shooting was accidental while preventing his wife from committing suicide and grappling for the gun.
    *   **Court's Rebuttal:** The act of drawing a weapon during a quarrel is unlawful (at least light threats under Article 285, par. 1, RPC) negating the "lawful act" requirement for accident as an exempting circumstance. The court further cites *People vs. Reyta, Jr.* 13 CAR (25) 1190.
2.  **Simple Negligence:** Accused claims only simple negligence since he was preventing her suicide.
    *   **Court's Rebuttal:** Physical evidence contradicts his version. Expert testimony and paraffin test results indicate that the victim was not grappling for the gun and was shot at a distance.
3.  **Failure to Prove Guilt Beyond Reasonable Doubt:** Accused asserted prosecution's failure to prove guilt.
    *   **Court's Rebuttal:** The prosecution successfully established all the elements of parricide beyond reasonable doubt.

**Key Evidence:**

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Eden Ontog (maid) testified to hearing the argument, a threat, and a gunshot.
*   **Forensic Evidence:**
    *   **Paraffin Test:** Victim's hands negative for nitrates; accused's right hand positive, indicating he fired the gun.
    *   **Medico-Legal Examination:** Dr. Arizala's second post-mortem examination indicating an upward trajectory of the bullet, incompatible with the accused's account.
*   **Stipulations:** Parties stipulated that the victim and accused were legally married and that the accused brought the victim to the hospital immediately after the shooting

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Discrepancy in Sentence:** The trial court initially stated "Forty (40) years of reclusion perpetua," which is technically incorrect. The Supreme Court corrected this to simply "reclusion perpetua," highlighting the indivisible nature of the penalty.
*   **Factual Disputes:** The defense heavily relied on its version of events (accidental shooting during a struggle) which was rejected by the Court based on forensic evidence and witness testimony.
*   **Assessment of Credibility:** The Supreme Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, a common practice but always a potential point of contention.

**Overall, the document presents a strong case for parricide based on the combination of eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence, and the accused's inability to prove any valid defense or mitigating circumstances.**
