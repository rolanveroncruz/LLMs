**Legal Document Summary: *People v. Bernabe*** (G.R. No. 185726, October 16, 2009)

**Nature:** Appeal of a CA Decision affirming with modifications the RTC conviction of Darwin Bernabe for Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Charge:** Murder, qualified by treachery, evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, and cruelty (though evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength were not ultimately proven).
*   **Facts:** Accused invited witnesses and victim to his home. Victim was interrogated, assaulted with a wooden plank and metal pipe, tortured (toothbrush inserted in anus), and ultimately strangled with G.I. wire. Eyewitness testimony identifies Bernabe as the perpetrator.
*   **Defense:** Denial and alibi; accused claimed lack of capacity to strangle due to a prior hand injury.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Accused-Appellant Bernabe:** Convicted of Murder, sentenced to *reclusion perpetua* without eligibility for parole. Liable for monetary damages to the victim's heirs: P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P25,000.00 as temperate damages, plus legal interest of 6% per annum.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Eyewitness Credibility:** The defense attacked the credibility of the eyewitnesses (Alvin and Jomar) due to inconsistencies in their testimonies and potential motives for falsely accusing the appellant. The Court addressed this by saying minor inconsistencies do not impair credibility if consistencies exist in the principal occurrence. The Court also cited the case *People v. Togahan* (G.R. No. 174064, June 8, 2007, 524 SCRA 557, 572) in its ruling about minor inconsistencies.
*   **Accused's Physical Capacity:** Bernabe claimed his hand injury prevented him from strangling the victim. This claim was refuted by the testimony of Dr. Raura, the surgeon who performed the surgery as well as the fact that the injury was to the 4th and 5th metacarpals.
*   **Aggravating Circumstances:** Cruelty was a key aggravating circumstance. This was proven through the torture perpetrated on the victim.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:** Defines Murder and its penalties.
*   **Republic Act No. 9346:** Prohibits the imposition of the death penalty.
*   **Article 14(21) of the Revised Penal Code** defines cruelty as an aggravating circumstance.
*   ***People v. Regalario*** (G.R. No. 174483, March 31, 2009): Jurisprudence dictates the award of civil indemnity in the amount of P75,000.00.
*   ***People v. Togahan*** (G.R. No. 174064, June 8, 2007, 524 SCRA 557, 572).
*   ***People v. Simon*** (G.R. No. 130531, May 27, 2004, 429 SCRA 330, 351) discusses that there is no standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling, or frightful experience.
*   ***People v. Crisanto*** (G.R. No. 120701, June 19, 2001, 358 SCRA 647, 658-659) Alibi is an inherently weak defense.
*   ***People v. Bonito*** (G.R. No. 128002, October 10, 2000, 342 SCRA 405, 427) is the case regarding the test in appreciating cruelty as an aggravating circumstance.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   None apparent, as the Court thoroughly addressed all raised points. The presence of two credible eyewitnesses who pointed to the accused as the one who committed the crime was the most important factor in determining his conviction.
