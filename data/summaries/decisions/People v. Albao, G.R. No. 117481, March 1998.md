## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Albao and Aleno*, G.R. No. 117481 (1998)

**Nature:** Appeal from a conviction for Murder in the Regional Trial Court of Puerto Princesa City, Palawan.

**Key Issue:**  Whether the accused are guilty of murder. Specifically, whether Renato Albao acted in self-defense and whether Jose Aleno conspired in the killing.

**Holding:**
*   Jose Aleno is acquitted.
*   Renato Albao is convicted of homicide.

**Key Provisions and Obligations:**

*   **Renato Albao's Claim of Self-Defense:**  Albao admitted to inflicting the fatal injuries but argued self-defense. The court held that Albao failed to prove the elements of self-defense with clear and convincing evidence. The court emphasized the inconsistencies in witness testimonies regarding who initiated the aggression and Albao's lack of injuries.

*   **Jose Aleno's Alibi:** Aleno presented an alibi defense, claiming he was at a barangay assembly in Puerto Princesa City at the time of the crime. The court found the prosecution's evidence against Aleno weak and gave weight to his alibi, as well as corroborating witness testimonies.

*   **Conspiracy:** The prosecution failed to prove a conspiracy between Albao and Aleno beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence was insufficient to establish a prior agreement or concerted acts demonstrating unity of purpose.

**Liabilities and Damages:**

*   **Renato Albao:**
    *   Convicted of Homicide.
    *   Sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight years and one day of *prision mayor* as minimum to fourteen years, eight months and one day of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
    *   Ordered to pay the heirs of the victim P50,000 as indemnity (no specific proof required).
*   **Jose Aleno:**
    *   Acquitted.
    *   Ordered to be released from confinement.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Albao's Rejection of Self-Defense:** The court noted the inconsistencies in the testimonies of Albao and his witnesses regarding the unlawful aggression and the reasonableness of his response, undermining the credibility of his self-defense claim.

*   **Ambiguous Evidence Against Aleno:** The court highlighted the contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses on Aleno’s involvement at the crime scene.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code:**  Murder (originally charged).
*   **Self-Defense:** The elements of self-defense must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. *People v. Maceda, 197 SCRA 499 (1991)*.
*   **Treachery (Alevosia):** Prosecution must prove treachery as clearly as the crime charged.
*   **Conspiracy:** Conspiracy must be established by proof beyond reasonable doubt. *People v. Orehuela, 232 SCRA 82 (1994)*.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law:** Applies to the sentencing of Albao.
*   **Moral Certainty:** The prosecution must prove a suspect's guilt beyond reasonable doubt to overcome the presumption of innocence *People v. Binamira, G.R. No. 110397 (1997)*.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Treachery:** Lack of evidence and conflicting testimonies hindered the determination of Treachery as a qualifying circumstance for the murder charge.
*   **Damages:** The trial court's award of "actual, moral, and exemplary damages" was deemed unsustainable due to lack of a specified basis. Instead, a straight indemnity award was made, eliminating any uncertainty or need for further proof.

**Overall Assessment:**

The Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s decision of murder because there was insufficient evidence to prove the qualifying circumstance of treachery and the conspiracy. The court found inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, lack of reliable evidence and proof that established beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.
