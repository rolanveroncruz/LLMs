## Legal Document Summary: *Interlink Movie Houses, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, et al.* (G.R. No. 203298)

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari regarding a CA decision nullifying an RTC decision in a sum of money and damages case.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Subject Matter:** Unpaid rentals and damages resulting from alleged breach of a lease contract by Expressions Stationery Shop, Inc. ("Expressions").
*   **Service of Summons:** The core issue revolves around the validity of service of summons on Expressions, a domestic corporation, and its President, Bon Huan.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 14, Section 11:** Specifies who can be served on behalf of a domestic private juridical entity (president, managing partner, general manager, corporate secretary, treasurer, or in-house counsel).
*   **Substituted Service (Rule 14, Section 7):** Requirements for valid substituted service when personal service is impossible, including multiple attempts and a detailed explanation in the Sheriff's Return (citing *Manotoc v. Court of Appeals*, 530 Phil. 454 (2006)).
*   **Special Appearance:** Doctrine allowing a party to contest jurisdiction without waiving objections, but requiring explicit and unequivocal objections to personal jurisdiction (citing *Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Spouses Dy*, 606 Phil. 615 (2009)).

**Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Interlink's Allegation:** Expressions is liable for unpaid rent, damages, and interest due to breach of contract.
*   **Expressions' Defense:** Challenges the court's jurisdiction due to improper service of summons.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Defective Service of Summons:** The primary risk for Interlink is that the improper service of summons could result in judgments being declared null and void, requiring the re-filing of the case and potentially running afoul of prescription issues.
*   **Res Judicata:** If the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, it could potentially bar future claims if not carefully framed.
*   **Costs:** The delays and appeals related to service of summons issues increase litigation costs.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Spouses Belen v. Judge Chavez, 573 Phil. 58, 67 (2008):** On jurisdiction acquired through service of summons or voluntary appearance.
*   **Cathay Metal Corporation v. Laguna West Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc., 738 Phil. 37, 57 (2014):** Enumeration of persons to be served for domestic corporations is exclusive.
*   **Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, 530 Phil. 454 (2006):** Establishes the standard for impossibility of prompt personal service to justify substituted service (multiple attempts, detailed Sheriff's Return).
*   **Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Spouses Dy, 606 Phil. 615 (2009):** Outlines the requirements for a valid special appearance, requiring explicit and unequivocal objections to personal jurisdiction.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The question of whether the second service of summons could be construed as *valid* substituted service on Bon Huan is contentious, especially given the lack of attempts to serve on Bon Huan.
*   The interpretation of Expressions' "special appearance" and whether their omnibus motion constituted a waiver of jurisdictional objections is another key point of contention.

**Summary:**

This case concerns a dispute over unpaid rent where the primary legal issue is whether the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the defendant corporation, Expressions. The Supreme Court affirmed the CA ruling that the service of summons was defective because it was served on a secretary who was not authorized to receive it. The Court also found that the attempts at personal service were insufficient to justify substituted service under *Manotoc*. Finally, the Court held that Expressions properly preserved its jurisdictional objections through a special appearance, despite filing an omnibus motion seeking affirmative relief. The primary risk for Interlink is the need to re-serve the summons and the potential for a statute of limitations issue.
