## Legal Document Summary: *Beltran v. Pabica* (A.M. No. P-14-3223)

**Nature:** Disciplinary proceeding against Raineria S. Pabica, former Court Stenographer I and Acting Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court of Palompon, Leyte.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Gross Misconduct:** Pabica found guilty of violating Canon I, Sections 1 & 2, and Canon IV, Section 5 of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP).
    *   **Recommendation of Attorney:**  Pabica convinced Beltran to hire Atty. Esmero, violating Canon IV, Section 5 (prohibition against recommending private attorneys). This is problematic as Atty. Esmero previously represented the opposing party in a related matter potentially creating a conflict of interest in violation of Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18. *Cf.* *Office of the Court Administrator v. Buzon*, 890 Phil. 367 (2020) – similar case involving a court stenographer assisting a litigant in finding legal representation.
    *   **Solicitation and Acceptance of Money:** Pabica solicited and received money from Beltran in exchange for a favorable decision, violating Canon I, Sections 1 & 2 (prohibiting use of position for unwarranted benefits and solicitation of gifts influencing official actions). *Cf.* *Office of the Court Administrator v. Buzon*, 890 Phil. 367 (2020) – Demand and receipt of money from party-litigants is constitutive of serious misconduct.
*   **Gross Insubordination:** Pabica repeatedly failed to comply with directives from the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) and the Supreme Court to file a comment, show cause, and pay a fine. *Cf.* *Frades v. Gabriel*, 821 Phil. 36 (2017).

**Liabilities:**

*   **Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits:** Due to Pabica's compulsory retirement on December 30, 2019, the penalty is forfeiture of retirement benefits (except accrued leave credits) and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office (Rule 140, Section 18(a) of the Rules of Court, as amended).
    *   Would have been dismissal under Rule 140, Section 14(a) and (n), in relation to Section 17 if she was still actively employed.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Attorney Conduct:**  The Court directs the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to investigate Atty. Esmero for potential conflict of interest violations under Canon III, Sections 13, 14, 17, and 18 of Code of Professional Responsibility. The scope and potential implications of this investigation for Atty. Esmero need to be considered.
*   **Reliance on Hearsay:** The decision relies heavily on Beltran's complaint without Pabica's response.  While Pabica's failure to respond is considered a waiver, the lack of counter-evidence could be a point of contention.
*   **Discrepancy in Dates:** The Resolution dated December 10, 2012, mentions a failure to comply with a June 27, *2021* Resolution. This is likely a typographical error and should be June 27, *2011* Resolution.
*   **Future Employment:** The disqualification from future public employment is a significant consequence for Pabica.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP) (A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC):** Canon I, Sections 1 & 2; Canon IV, Section 5
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 140, Sections 14(a) and (n), 17, 18(a):** (Amended provisions regarding disciplinary proceedings and penalties).
