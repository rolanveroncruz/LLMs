**Case Summary: Aspillaga v. Aspillaga, G.R. No. 170925, October 26, 2009**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' decision reversing the RTC's declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code.

**Facts:** Rodolfo Aspillaga sought annulment of his marriage to Aurora Aspillaga, alleging psychological incapacity on her part. He cited domineering behavior, spendthrift habits, and jealousy. Aurora countered with allegations of Rodolfo's infidelity. An expert witness presented psychiatric evaluations suggesting both parties had psychological disorders.

**Issue:** Whether the marriage is void on the ground of the parties' psychological incapacity.

**Holding:** No. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, declaring the marriage valid. The petition was denied.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Article 36 of the Family Code:** The Court reiterated the requirements established in *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 112019, January 4, 1995, 240 SCRA 20) for psychological incapacity:
    *   **Gravity:** The incapacity must be grave and serious, rendering the party incapable of fulfilling essential marital obligations.
    *   **Juridical Antecedence:** The root cause must pre-exist the marriage, even if manifestations appear later.
    *   **Incurability:** The incapacity must be incurable or, if curable, beyond the party's means.

*   **Expert Testimony:** While expert testimony established the existence of personality disorders in both parties, it failed to sufficiently demonstrate that these disorders:
    *   Were of such gravity as to render them incapable of fulfilling their marital obligations.
    *   Were incurable or permanent.
    *   Had juridical antecedence (existing before the marriage).
    *   Established a causal link between the disorders and the inability to comply with marriage obligations.

*   **Burden of Proof:** Petitioner (Rodolfo) failed to discharge his burden of proving the nullity of the marriage. The court emphasized that mere difficulty, refusal, or neglect in performing marital obligations does not equate to psychological incapacity. *Republic v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997, 268 SCRA 198, 209)

*   **Marital History:** The Court highlighted that the parties enjoyed a relatively harmonious marriage for several years. This contradicted the claim of pre-existing and grave psychological incapacity.

*   **Infidelity & Financial Disagreements:** Rodolfo's infidelity and disagreements over financial matters were deemed insufficient grounds for annulment under Article 36.

*   **Psychological Incapacity vs. Incompatibility:** The Court clarified that Article 36 is not a divorce law and should not be confused with simple incompatibility or irreconcilable differences (*Paras v. Paras*, G.R. No. 147824, August 2, 2007, 529 SCRA 81, 106-107).

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Grave" Incapacity:** The definition of "grave" incapacity remains somewhat subjective, leaving room for inconsistent application of Article 36.
*   **Reliance on Expert Testimony:** The case underscores the critical importance of thoroughly prepared and convincing expert testimony in psychological incapacity cases. The expert's conclusions must be firmly linked to the evidence and the legal requirements.

**Statutory References:**

*   Family Code, Article 36

**Case Law:**

*   *Santos v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 112019, January 4, 1995, 240 SCRA 20)
*   *Republic v. Court of Appeals* (G.R. No. 108763, February 13, 1997, 268 SCRA 198, 209)
    *Paras v. Paras (G.R. No. 147824, August 2, 2007, 529 SCRA 81, 106-107)

**Conclusion:**

This case reinforces the strict interpretation of psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code and highlights the heavy burden of proof on the petitioner. It emphasizes that mere personality disorders or marital difficulties are insufficient grounds for annulment, absent a clear showing of grave, pre-existing, and incurable incapacity to fulfill essential marital obligations. The need for a strong causal link between the psychological condition and the inability to fulfill the essential marital obligations must be convincingly demonstrated by the expert witness.
