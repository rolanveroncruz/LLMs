**Case Summary: *Santos-Tan v. Robiso*, Adm. Case No. 6383 (2009)**

**Nature:** Administrative complaint for disbarment filed by Irene Santos-Tan against Atty. Romeo Robiso, alleging gross negligence in handling a special proceeding and issuance of a bouncing check in violation of B.P. Blg. 22.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Engagement & Fees:** Complainant engaged Respondent for representation in an intestate estate case (Special Proceeding No. 01-101339) and paid a P100,000 acceptance fee.  Respondent's sole action was filing a notice of appearance.

*   **Negligence Claim:** The Court agreed with the IBP that no evidence existed to prove that the Respondent was negligent in handling the Complainant's case as the motions were already pending before the RTC and the presiding judge was under suspension.

*   **Bouncing Check (Violation of B.P. Blg. 22):** Respondent issued a P85,000 check that bounced due to insufficient funds.  Respondent claimed lack of consideration, alleging it was issued to stop complainant's "acerbic verbal abuse." The Court rejected this, finding the check was meant to return a portion of the unearned fee. The Court held that the Respondent's issuance of the worthless check meant he was guilty of serious misconduct.
    *   **Case Law:**  The decision cites *People v. Tuanda* (181 SCRA 692 (1990)) and *Lozano v. Martinez* (146 SCRA 323 (1986)) for the principle that B.P. Blg. 22 punishes an offense against public order, not merely property, and harms the public interest. The Court also cites *Cuizon v. Macalino*, Adm Case No. 4334, 7 July 2004, 433 SCRA 479, 486 and *Lao v. Atty. Medel*, 453 Phil. 115, 124 (2003) for the principle that the deliberate failure to pay just debts constitutes gross misconduct.

*   **Violation of Code of Professional Responsibility:**  Respondent's actions violated Canon 1, Rule 1.01 (unlawful/dishonest conduct), and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 (conduct reflecting poorly on the profession).

**Obligations:**

*   Respondent is obligated to obey the laws of the land (Canon 1).
*   Respondent is ordered to pay the Complainant P85,000.00, as reflected in the check.

**Liabilities:**

*   Administrative liability for violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and B.P. Blg. 22.

**Disciplinary Action:**

*   Suspension from the practice of law for one (1) month.
*   Restitution of P85,000 to the complainant.
*   Stern warning against future misconduct.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguous Justification:** Respondent's argument of issuing the check under duress to stop "acerbic verbal abuse" was viewed skeptically by the court and did not excuse his action.

*   **Reliance on Secretary's Testimony:** Respondent's reliance on his secretary's testimony regarding the case file and the verbal abuse may have been seen as insufficient evidence.

**Statutory References:**

*   Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (B.P. Blg. 22) - Issuance of Bouncing Checks Law
*   Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court - Procedure for administrative complaints against attorneys
*   Code of Professional Responsibility - Canons 1 & 7, Rules 1.01 & 7.03.

**Conclusion:**

The Court affirmed the IBP's findings that Atty. Robiso violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and B.P. Blg. 22 through the issuance of a bouncing check, warranting disciplinary action despite a finding that he was not negligent in handling the Complainant's case. The decision reinforces the principle that lawyers must uphold the law and maintain high ethical standards.
