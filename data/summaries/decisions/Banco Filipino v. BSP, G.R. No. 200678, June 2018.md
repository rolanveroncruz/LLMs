## Legal Document Summary: Banco Filipino v. BSP and Monetary Board (G.R. No. 200678)

**Nature of Document:** Supreme Court Decision resolving a Petition for Review on Certiorari concerning jurisdiction over actions against the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Monetary Board (MB).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Receivership:** A bank ordered closed by the BSP can only sue or be sued through its receiver, the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC). Any action filed by the closed bank without the PDIC's participation may be dismissed.
*   **BSP as Quasi-Judicial Body:** The BSP, through the MB, exercises quasi-judicial functions.
*   **Jurisdiction:** Special civil actions (certiorari, mandamus) against quasi-judicial agencies like the BSP Monetary Board must be filed in the Court of Appeals (CA), not the Regional Trial Court (RTC), unless otherwise provided by law or the Rules of Court (Rule 65, Section 4, Rules of Court).
*   **Suspension of Powers:** When a bank is placed under receivership, the powers of its Board of Directors and officers are suspended, giving the receiver (PDIC) control. Thus, the Board of Directors could not have validly authorized its Executive Vice Presidents to file the suit on its behalf.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Banco Filipino (BF):** Obligated to pursue legal actions through the PDIC as receiver after being placed under receivership. BF faces potential liability for failing to comply with the condition precedent of withdrawing pending cases against BSP and MB to secure the financial assistance package.
*   **PDIC:** Obligated to act as the receiver of the closed bank and administer its assets for the benefit of its creditors (RA 7653, Section 30). Has the power to bring and defend actions in its own name and/or on behalf of the closed bank.
*   **BSP/MB:** Subject to challenges to their regulatory actions, particularly regarding the imposition of conditions on financial assistance (e.g., withdrawal of lawsuits).

**Potential Risks:**

*   **BF:** Dismissal of actions due to lack of legal capacity to sue without the PDIC. Potential liability for legal costs. Risk of failing to rehabilitate its business due to non-compliance with BSP's requirements.
*   **PDIC:** Potential liability for failing to properly administer the assets of the bank.
*   **BSP/MB:** Potential reputational risk if conditions imposed on financial assistance are deemed unreasonable or contrary to public policy. Risk of actions against them if regulatory actions are deemed to be an abuse of discretion.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Republic Act No. 7653 (The New Central Bank Act):** Governs the BSP and its powers, including receivership of insolvent banks.
*   **Republic Act No. 3591 (PDIC Charter), as amended by RA 9302:** Defines the powers and duties of the PDIC as receiver.
*   **Rule 65, Section 4, Rules of Court:**  Outlines where and when to file a petition for certiorari. Specifies that actions against quasi-judicial agencies must be filed in the Court of Appeals.
*   **Rule 59, Section 6 of the Rules of Court:** The receiver shall have the power to bring and defend, in such capacity, actions in his own name.

**Case Law References:**

*   **Banco Filipino Savings & Mortgage Bank v. Monetary Board and Central Bank of the Philippines, 281 Phil. 847 (1991):** Initial ruling regarding the validity of BF's closure.
*   **Hernandez v. Rural Bank of Lucena, 171 Phil. 70 (1978):** An insolvent bank under liquidation could not sue or be sued except through its liquidator.
*   **Manalo v. Court of Appeals, 419 Phil. 215 (2001):** Reiterated this principle with the limitation that the prosecution or defense of the action must be done through the liquidator.
*   **United Coconut Planters Bank v. E. Ganzon, Inc., 609 Phil. 104 (2009):** Definition of a quasi-judicial agency and affirmation of the MB's quasi-judicial powers.
*   **National Water Resources Board v. A. L. Ang Network, 632 Phil. 22 (2010):** The principle where special civil cases filed against quasi-judicial agencies must be filed before the Court of Appeals.
*   **Merchants Rural Bank of Talavera v. Monetary Board, et al. (CA-G.R. SP No. 93118, August 3, 2006):** A Court of Appeals decision does not function as stare decisis or amend the Rules of Court.
*   **Vivas v. Monetary Board and Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, 716 Phil. 132 (2013):** The proper remedy to question a resolution of the Monetary Board is through a petition for certiorari filed with the Court of Appeals.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The condition imposed by the BSP/MB requiring BF to withdraw all pending lawsuits in exchange for financial assistance. This raises concerns about coercion and violation of access to justice. The Supreme Court did not definitively rule on the validity of this condition.

**Summary of Holding:**

The Supreme Court *dismissed* Banco Filipino's Petition due to lack of legal capacity to sue. BF, as a closed bank under receivership, cannot file suit without the PDIC as a party. Even assuming BF had capacity, the petition would be denied because the Regional Trial Court lacks jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari against quasi-judicial agencies like the BSP Monetary Board; such actions must be filed with the Court of Appeals.
