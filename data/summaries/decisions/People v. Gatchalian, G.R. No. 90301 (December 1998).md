**Potential Risks and Contentious Issues:**

*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The core issue is witness credibility. The defense argued that the prosecution witnesses had ulterior motives.

*   **Qualifying Circumstance (Treachery):**  The Supreme Court upheld the finding of treachery based on the sudden and unexpected nature of the attack, where the victim was first incapacitated by Hagibis, and then stabbed by Gatchalian. The defense disputed this, implying a prior altercation and lack of surprise.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of Juancho Gatchalian for murder, emphasizing the credibility of prosecution witnesses and the implausibility of the defense's self-defense claim. The finding of treachery as a qualifying circumstance was crucial to the outcome.
