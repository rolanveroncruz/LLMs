## Legal Document Summary: *Banco de Oro Unibank, Inc. vs. VTL Realty, Inc.* (G.R. No. 193499)

This case concerns a dispute over the amount owed by VTL Realty, Inc. (VTL) to Banco de Oro Unibank, Inc. (BDO) arising from VTL's assumption of a mortgage on property originally owned by Victor Bollozos, securing a loan of World's Arts & Crafts, Inc. BDO foreclosed on the mortgage due to non-payment.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Assumption of Mortgage:** VTL entered into a Deed of Definite Sale with Assumption of Mortgage with Bollozos, obligating VTL to assume the loan obligation.
*   **BDO's Refusal:** BDO initially refused to recognize VTL as the new owner and refused VTL's payment, leading to litigation.
*   **Court Orders:** The RTC ordered BDO to furnish VTL with a statement of account, and ordered VTL to pay the obligation based on the original statement plus accrued interest and penalties. This was affirmed by the CA.
*   **Foreclosure and Consolidation:** BDO foreclosed the mortgage, purchased the property at auction, and consolidated ownership after the redemption period expired.
*   **Dispute Over Interest Calculation:** The primary dispute is whether interest and penalties should accrue *only* up to the date of registration of the Certificate of Sale (April 28, 1995), as argued by VTL (relying on CA's misinterpretation of *DBP vs. Zaragoza*), or until the date of the statement of account as ordered in previous rulings.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **VTL's Liability:** VTL is liable for the original loan amount plus accrued interest and penalties as calculated in the latest statement of account by BDO. The risk for VTL is the significantly higher amount (P41,769,596.94 as of March 16, 2007) compared to its desired calculation (P6,631,840.95 as of April 28, 1995).
*   **BDO's Risk:** BDO previously faced the risk of being compelled to accept a significantly lower payment based on the CA's erroneous application of *DBP vs. Zaragoza*. This has been overturned by the Supreme Court.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **DBP vs. Zaragoza (174 Phil. 153 (1978)):** Misinterpreted by the CA. The Supreme Court clarified that this case addressed the issue of interest liability *between* foreclosure and sale of property, not the total extinguishment of interest after foreclosure when no redemption occurred.
*   **PNB vs. CA (224 Phil. 499 (1985)):** Also misapplied by the CA. This case concerned the *redemption price* under Act No. 3135, which is not applicable here as VTL did not exercise its right of redemption.
*   **Act No. 3135:** The law governing extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages. Section 6 regarding redemption.
*   **Rule 39, Section 30 of the Rules of Court:** Pertains to redemption amount.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The CA decision misapplied *DBP vs. Zaragoza* and *PNB vs. CA*, leading to an incorrect determination of the interest calculation.
*   The CA decision violated the principle of immutability of judgments, as the earlier CA decision affirming the RTC's ruling on interest calculation was already final and executory.

**Supreme Court Ruling:**

The Supreme Court reversed the CA decision, holding that VTL is liable for the full amount calculated by BDO, including accrued interest and penalties. *DBP vs. Zaragoza* and *PNB vs. CA* were deemed inapplicable. The Court emphasized the principle of immutability of judgments, reinstating the RTC's orders.
