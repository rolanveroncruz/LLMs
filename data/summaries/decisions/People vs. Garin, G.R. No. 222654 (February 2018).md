**Case Summary: *People of the Philippines v. Romeo Garin y Osorio*** (G.R. No. 222654, February 21, 2018)

**Nature:** Appeal from a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming with modification the Regional Trial Court's (RTC) judgment finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape through sexual assault in relation to Republic Act (RA) No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Charge:** Violation of Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) as amended by RA 8353 (Anti-Rape Law of 1997) in relation to RA 7610 (Child Abuse). Specifically, carnal knowledge (insertion of finger into the vagina) of a four-year-old minor ("AAA") by force.
*   **Stipulations:** The defense admitted the identity of the appellant, the victim's age (4 years old), and the date of the incident.
*   **Evidence:** The prosecution presented the testimony of the victim, her mother, a witness, and a doctor. The defense presented the testimony of the appellant and his mother. Medical findings corroborated the victim's testimony regarding abrasions and redness in the vaginal area.
*   **RTC Ruling:** Found the appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt and sentenced him to reclusion perpetua with damages (moral, civil indemnity, and exemplary).
*   **CA Ruling:** Affirmed conviction but modified the penalty and civil indemnity. Reduced the penalties to an indeterminate sentence of 8 years and 1 day of *prision mayor* to 12 years and 1 day of *reclusion temporal*. Adjusted civil liabilities to P30,000 each for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** Affirmed the CA's finding of guilt but *modified the maximum period of the indeterminate penalty imposed by the CA.*
*   **Indeterminate Penalty:** Increased the maximum period from 12 years and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal*.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Criminal Liability:** Guilty of rape through sexual assault under Article 266-A of the RPC in relation to RA 7610.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence:** Eight (8) years and one (1) day of *prision mayor*, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of *reclusion temporal* as maximum.
*   **Civil Liability:** P30,000.00 as civil indemnity *ex delicto*, P30,000.00 as moral damages, and P30,000.00 as exemplary damages. 6% interest per annum on all damages awarded from the date of finality of the judgment until fully paid.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Sentencing Discrepancies:** The initial RTC sentence of reclusion perpetua was reduced by the CA. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision, correcting only the maximum period.
*   **Factual Disputes:** Appellant claimed alibi. However, his testimony on cross-examination contradicted his initial denial. The Court deemed this inconsistent testimony unreliable.
*   **Minor Victim Testimony:** The Court accorded great weight to the testimony of the minor victim, relying on jurisprudence that treats such testimonies with credence.
*   **In-Court Identification:** The absence of in-court identification was not deemed fatal because the appellant's identity was stipulated during pre-trial.
