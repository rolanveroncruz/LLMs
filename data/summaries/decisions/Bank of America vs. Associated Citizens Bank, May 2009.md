**Summary of *Bank of America, NT & SA vs. Associated Citizens Bank, et al.* (G.R. No. 141001 & 141018)**

**Core Issue:** Determination of liability for the encashment of crossed checks with "For Payee's Account Only" notation, deposited into an unauthorized account.

**Key Provisions and Findings:**

*   **Facts:** BA-Finance issued crossed checks payable to "Miller Offset Press, Inc." which were deposited by Miller's corporate secretary, Ching Uy Seng, into his personal joint account at Associated Bank. Associated Bank guaranteed prior endorsements and sent the checks for clearing. Bank of America (drawee bank) honored the checks. Miller failed to remit the proceeds to BA-Finance.
*   **Drawee Bank Liability (Bank of America):** The Supreme Court affirmed Bank of America's liability to BA-Finance. A drawee bank has a strict duty to pay only to the payee or the payee's order. Paying a person other than the named payee on a crossed check marked "For Payee's Account Only" violates this duty and makes the drawee liable to the drawer (BA-Finance). _Citing PNB v. Rodriguez_ (G.R. No. 170325, 26 September 2008).
*   **Collecting Bank Liability (Associated Bank):** The Supreme Court affirmed Associated Bank's liability to reimburse Bank of America.  As the collecting bank, Associated Bank endorsed the checks, guaranteeing prior endorsements. Under Section 66 of the Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL), an endorser warrants the genuineness and validity of the instrument. Associated Bank breached this warranty by allowing deposit into an unauthorized account. The Court emphasized the collecting bank's duty to exercise diligence in scrutinizing checks for genuineness and regularity. _Citing Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Equitable Banking Corporation_ which held that collecting banks hold themselves to a high standard.
*   **Liability of Ching Uy Seng and/or Uy Chung Guan Seng:**  The Court affirmed the CA ruling that Ching Uy Seng and/or Uy Chung Guan Seng are liable to reimburse Associated Bank, applying the principle against unjust enrichment.
*   **Crossed Checks:** The Court reiterated established jurisprudence on crossed checks, stating that their crossing serves as a warning that the check has been issued for a definite purpose and can only be deposited, not encashed, by the payee. _Citing Bataan Cigar v. Court of Appeals, supra._

**Obligations:**

*   **Bank of America:** Obligated to pay BA-Finance the face value of the checks plus legal interest.
*   **Associated Bank:** Obligated to reimburse Bank of America.
*   **Ching Uy Seng and Uy Chung Guan Seng:** Jointly and Severally obligated to reimburse Associated Bank.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Breach of Warranty:** Associated Bank faced the risk of liability due to its warranty of prior endorsements under the NIL.
*   **Negligence:** All banks have a duty of due diligence in processing checks, failing which, may lead to liability.
*   **Unjust Enrichment:** Individuals who receive funds without just cause are exposed to a risk of obligation to reimburse the party who had been affected.

**Statutory References:**

*   Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 66 (Endorser's Warranty)
*   Code of Commerce, Article 541 (Crossed Checks)

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The primary ambiguity lies in the specific authorization granted to Ching Uy Seng. The court did not rule in his favor by reason of him being a corporate secretary of Miller Offset Press, Inc.
