**Legal Document Summary: *Bismonte v. Golden Sunset Resort and Spa*** (G.R. No. 229326)

**Core Issue:** Whether the CA erred in ruling petitioners' appeal to the NLRC was filed out of time and improperly filed.

**Facts:** Petitioners, resort staff, filed complaints for illegal dismissal and unpaid benefits against respondents. The LA dismissed the complaints. The NLRC reversed, finding an employer-employee relationship and awarding monetary claims but not finding illegal dismissal. The CA reversed the NLRC, reinstating the LA's decision, citing a late appeal filing to the NLRC and failure to personally file.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court (SC) GRANTED the petition, reversing the CA and remanding the case for a resolution on the merits.

**Key Provisions & Legal Analysis:**

*   **Timeliness of Appeal:** The CA ruled that the appeal was filed late. The SC held that the appeal to the NLRC was timely, based on the post office stamp date (March 31, 2014) on the envelope, which was within the ten-day appeal period stipulated in Section 1, Rule VI of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure.
*   **Mode of Filing:** The CA criticized the PAO for filing via registered mail instead of personally given proximity to the NLRC. The SC, citing Section 11, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court (applied suppletorily as per Section 3, Rule I of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure), acknowledged the preference for personal filing but excused the lack of written explanation, as the NLRC accepted the appeal and it appeared meritorious (citing *Pe√±oso v. Dona*, 549 Phil. 39 (2007)).
*   **Application of Rules of Procedure:** The SC emphasized that substantial justice outweighs strict adherence to procedural rules and that rules should not be applied rigidly, referring to *Aguam v CA*, 388 Phil. 587, 594 (2000).
*   **Suppletory Application of Rules of Court:** The SC invoked the principle that in the absence of specific provisions in the NLRC Rules, the Rules of Court may be applied suppletorily.

**Obligations:**

*   Respondents (Golden Sunset Resort and Reyes): The CA must resolve the merits of the case based on substantial evidence regarding the existence of employer-employee relationship and entitlement to monetary claims.

**Liabilities:**

*   Respondents could be liable for monetary claims if the CA, on remand, finds in favor of the petitioners.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Remand Risk:** The case is remanded to the CA. Therefore, the ruling is not final and could change upon further litigation.
*   **Substantive Issues:** The core issue of whether an employer-employee relationship existed and whether petitioners are entitled to benefits remains unresolved and subject to CA determination.

**Contentious Issues:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship vs. Independent Contractorship:** Respondents' claim of "independent contractorship" was not definitively resolved, as the CA has yet to resolve this issue on the merits.
*   **Constructive/Illegal Dismissal:** While NLRC said there was a valid reason for the reduction of working days for five petitioners as there was an onset of the rainy season, the CA has yet to resolve this on the merits.
