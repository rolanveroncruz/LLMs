## Legal Document Summary: *People v. Belmonte y Saa*, G.R. No. 224588

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction for violation of Sections 11 (possession of dangerous drugs) and 5 (sale of dangerous drugs), Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002). The Supreme Court (SC) ultimately **REVERSED** the conviction and **ACQUITTED** the accused.

**Key Provisions/Obligations:**

*   **RA 9165, Sections 5 and 11, Article II:** Defines and penalizes the sale, trade, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution, and transportation of dangerous drugs, as well as the unauthorized possession of dangerous drugs.
*   **Section 21, RA 9165 and its IRR (Implementing Rules and Regulations):** Specifies procedures for the custody and disposition of confiscated drugs, including immediate inventory, photography in the presence of the accused (or representative/counsel), media representative, DOJ representative, and elected public official, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. Failure to comply is allowed under justifiable grounds, provided the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.
*   **Chain of Custody:** Strict adherence to chain of custody is required to ensure that the drugs seized from the accused are the same drugs tested in the laboratory and offered in court as evidence. Four critical links identified.

**Liabilities:**

*   RTC and CA found accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt, imposing penalties of imprisonment and fines for violations of Sections 11 and 5 of RA 9165. Specifically, in Crim. Case No. 2010-713, the accused was charged with violation of Sec. 11,[36], Art. II of R.A. No. 9165. In Crim. Case No. 2010-714, the accused-appellant was convicted for violation of Sec. 5, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165

**Potential Risks/Ambiguities/Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Break in Chain of Custody:** The SC found a significant break in the chain of custody. Conflicting testimonies about who possessed the drugs after seizure raise reasonable doubt as to whether the evidence presented in court was the same evidence seized from the accused.
*   **Non-Compliance with Section 21 RA 9165:** The SC found the police officers failed to comply with the mandatory procedures outlined in Sec. 21, Article II of RA 9165, including: failing to conduct a physical inventory, failing to photograph the seized items, failure to include the marks on the items in the buy-bust operation report entered in the blotter
*   **Lack of Justifiable Grounds:** The prosecution failed to provide justifiable grounds for non-compliance with Section 21, as required by the IRR. The SC emphasized that it cannot *presume* justifiable grounds.
*   **Compromised Integrity:** The evidence presented to establish that the seized drugs were the same as those tested and presented in court was deemed compromised. The SC notes Carna, who marked the items, could not readily distinguish the shabu sachets handed by the accused, since they contained almost the same weight of shabu.
*   **Presumption of Regularity vs. Presumption of Innocence:** The SC held that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by the police officers was overcome by the evidence of non-compliance with mandatory procedures and the accused's constitutional right to be presumed innocent.

**Case Law/Statutory References:**

*   **RA 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002):** The primary statutory basis for the charges.
*   **Revised Rules on Evidence, Rule 133, Sec. 2:** Degree of proof required for conviction (proof beyond reasonable doubt).
*   **Relevant SC jurisprudence:**  The SC cites a plethora of recent cases supporting its decision, including cases addressing chain of custody requirements, the presumption of regularity, and the prosecution's burden of proof (e.g., *People v. Hilario*, *People v. Macud*, *Mallillin v. People*).
*   **People v. Jaafar, G.R. No. 219829, 18 January 2017:** Narcotic substances are not readily identifiable.
*   **People v. Holgado, 741 Phil. 78, 94 (2014):** Marking of seized drugs alone by the law enforcers is not enough to comply with the clear and unequivocal procedures prescribed in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165
*   **People v. Gayoso, G.R. No. 206590,27 March 2017:** Serious uncertainty is generated on the identity of the shabu in view of the broken linkages in the chain of custody; thus, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty accorded to the apprehending officers by the courts below cannot arise.
*   **People v. AÃ±o, G.R. No. 230070, 14 March 2018:** The procedure under Sec. 21, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165 is a matter of substantive law

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court overturned the conviction based on a flawed chain of custody and the police's failure to adhere to the mandatory requirements of Section 21 of RA 9165, leading to a reasonable doubt as to the integrity of the evidence. The SC prioritized the accused's right to be presumed innocent and emphasizes the need for strict compliance with drug evidence handling procedures.
