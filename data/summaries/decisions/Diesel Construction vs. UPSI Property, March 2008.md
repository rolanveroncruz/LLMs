## Legal Document Summary: Diesel Construction Co., Inc. vs. UPSI Property Holdings, Inc.

**Case:** G.R. No. 154885 & 154937 (Consolidated), *Diesel Construction Co., Inc. v. UPSI Property Holdings, Inc.*

**Nature:** Consolidated Petitions for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision and Resolution which modified the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) decision in favor of Diesel.

**Key Provisions & Agreements:**

*   **Construction Agreement:** Contract between Diesel (Contractor) and UPSI (Owner) for interior architectural construction works.
*   **Scope of Work:** Interior construction of floors 14-16 of a building, to be completed within 90 days after construction.
*   **Payment:** Progress billing based on completed work.
*   **Performance Bond:** Diesel provided a performance bond through FGU Insurance Corp.
*   **Excusable Delays:** Defined events (Acts of God, civil disturbance, government actions) that could justify extensions of the contract period. Delays must be initiated by the owner and outside of the control of the contractor.
*   **Change Orders:** Procedures for changes to the scope of work, requiring written agreement on revised schedules/completion dates.
*   **Liquidated Damages:** Clause stipulating damages of 1/5 of 1% of the total project cost for each calendar day of unjustifiable delay.
*   **Substantial Completion:** Substantial Completion as of March 2000.
*   **Article 1234 of the Civil Code:** Obligor may recover as though there had been a strict and complete fulfillment, less damages suffered by the obligee.
*   **Uniform General Conditions of Contract for Private Construction (CIAP Document 102):** no liquidated damages for delay beyond the completion time shall accrue after the date of substantial completion of the work.

**Dispute:**

*   Diesel claimed UPSI withheld the 10% "retention money" and refused to pay the unpaid balance despite project completion.
*   UPSI alleged Diesel abandoned the unfinished project and sought repayment of expenses incurred to complete it, and affirmed the legality of deductions made for liquidated damages.

**CIAC Ruling:**

*   Favored Diesel, ordering UPSI to pay the unpaid balance and attorney's fees.
*   Dismissed UPSI's counterclaim and assessed UPSI with arbitration costs.

**CA Ruling (Modified):**

*   Reduced award for unpaid balance.
*   Awarded UPSI liquidated damages for a reduced number of delay days (45 days).
*   Denied Diesel's attorney's fees.
*   Ordered both parties to share arbitration costs equally.
*   Discharged FGU as surety.

**Supreme Court Holding:**

*   **Partially granted** Diesel's petition and **denied** UPSI's petition with qualification.
*   **Reinstated** award for unpaid balance of the contract price of PhP 3,661,692.64.
*   **Deleted** the award for liquidated damages and attorney's fees
*   Diesel is awarded attorney’s fees in the amount of PhP 366,169
*   UPSI is awarded damages in the amount of PhP 310,834.01, the same to be deducted from the retention money, if there still be any.

**Key Issues:**

*   **CIAC Arbitral Tribunal Qualifications:** Whether the CA could review the CIAC's decision based on alleged lack of "technocratic" expertise of the arbitral panel members. The Supreme Court noted that the CA's reasoning was specious, with respect to the necessary qualifications.
*   **Substantiality of Evidence & CA Review:** Whether the CA erred in substituting its own opinion for the CIAC's findings, especially concerning delay.
*   **Delay & Liquidated Damages:** Whether Diesel incurred delay justifying liquidated damages, considering excusable delays, Change Orders, and substantial completion.
*   **Completion & Additional Expenses:** Whether UPSI was entitled to claim additional expenses for completing the allegedly abandoned project.
*   **Attorney's Fees & Arbitration Costs:** Whether the CIAC's award of attorney's fees to Diesel and assessment of arbitration costs against UPSI were justified.

**Statutory References & Case Law:**

*   **Article 1234 of the Civil Code:** Substantial performance in good faith.
*   **Art. 2208 of the Civil Code**: Defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff’s plainly valid, just and demandable claim
*   **Superlines Transportation Company, Inc. v. Philippine National Construction Company:** Outlines the exceptions where the court will review the factual findings.
*   **Blue Bar Coconut Philippines v. Tantuico**: Court of Justice should respect findings of fact of said administrative agencies, unless there is absolutely no evidence.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Definition of "Excusable Delay":** Interpretation of events considered excusable delays, potentially leading to disputes over contract period extensions.
*   **Change Order Procedures:** Ambiguity in the process for agreeing on revised schedules/completion dates for Change Orders, which could lead to disagreement and delay.
*   **Assessment of Liquidated Damages:** Application of the liquidated damages clause, particularly determining the number of days of unjustifiable delay and calculating the appropriate amount.
*   **Abandonment Allegations:** Risk of dispute over whether the project was genuinely abandoned by Diesel and the validity of UPSI's claims for expenses to complete it.
*   **Proof of Causation for Additional Expenses:** Difficulty for UPSI in proving that its claimed "additional or rectification" works were directly caused by faulty workmanship by Diesel.

**Analysis:**

The Supreme Court ultimately favored Diesel, finding no valid basis for liquidated damages. The Court emphasized the impact of the Change Orders in altering the original completion date and credited Diesel with substantial completion. The SC also reaffirmed the award for attorney's fees and ultimately assessed arbitration fees against UPSI as the withholding was determined to be caused by their "whim."
