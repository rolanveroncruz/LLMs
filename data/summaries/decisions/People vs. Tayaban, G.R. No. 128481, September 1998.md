## Legal Document Summary: People v. Tayaban, G.R. No. 128481, September 25, 1998 (357 Phil. 494)

**Nature:** Appeal of a conviction for rape. The lower court found Gerald Tayaban guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court affirmed.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **Crime:** Rape, as defined in Article 315 (1) of the Revised Penal Code (carnal knowledge through force and intimidation).
*   **Penalty:** Reclusion perpetua and payment of P50,000.00 indemnity to the victim.

**Key Facts:**

*   Accused-Appellant Gerald Tayaban was charged with raping the victim Charmaigne Abad.
*   The prosecution's case rested primarily on the sole testimony of the victim who was 14 at the time of the incident.
*   The defense presented a "sweethearts defense," claiming consensual sexual relations.

**Obligations:**

*   **Accused:** To refrain from using force and intimidation to have carnal knowledge of another person.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Accused:** Found guilty of rape and sentenced to reclusion perpetua with an obligation to pay indemnity to the victim.

**Potential Risks/Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Delay in Reporting:** The defense argued the victim's delay in reporting the alleged rape cast doubt on her credibility. The court addressed this by saying it's not uncommon for young girls to conceal assaults due to the rapist's threats.
*   **Sweethearts Defense:** The defense argued the victim was a "sweetheart" and consented to the sexual relations. The court discredited this argument based on the age and relationship of the parties.
*   **Lack of Resistance:** The defense argued the victim did not resist enough. However, the court noted the disparity in size and strength between the victim and accused.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **Credibility of Witness:** The court relied on established jurisprudence that the sole testimony of a rape victim, if credible and clear, is sufficient to sustain a conviction. (citing *People v. Ferrer*)
*   **Force/Intimidation:** The court referred to the relative nature of force required for rape, depending on the parties involved (*People v. Moreno*). The prosecution needs to establish the use of force or intimidation (*People v. Segundo*). Resistance is not required if intimidation is exercised upon the victim and for fear of personal safety (*People v. Angeles*).
*   **Sweethearts Defense:** The court dismissed the "sweethearts defense" and noted that even if the victim was a sweetheart, force and intimidation still constitute rape (*People v. Domingo*).
*   **Child Victims:** Testimony of child-victims are given full weight and credit (*People v. Gabayron*)

**Statutory References:**

*   Revised Penal Code, Article 315 (1) (definition of rape)

**Analysis:**

The case highlights the importance of the credibility of the victim's testimony in rape cases. The court found the testimony of Charmaigne Abad to be credible, clear, and straightforward. The court considered the victim's age, the accused's threat, the relationship between them, and ruled in favor of the prosecution. The defense arguments regarding delay in reporting and lack of resistance were unpersuasive. The potential risk lies in the reliance on the victim's sole testimony; however, the court found this sufficient given its credibility. The case reinforces the principle that a person cannot be forced to have sex against their will, even if they have had a prior relationship with the assailant.
