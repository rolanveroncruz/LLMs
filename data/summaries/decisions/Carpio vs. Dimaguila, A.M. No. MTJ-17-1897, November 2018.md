**Case Summary: *Ma. Victoria S.D. Carpio and John Persius S.D. Carpio v. Judge Elenita C. Dimaguila***

**Citation:** A.M. No. MTJ-17-1897, November 21, 2018 (843 Phil. 533)

**Issue:** Whether Judge Dimaguila's failure to refer a Grave Coercion case to mandatory Court-Annexed Mediation (CAM) and Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) constitutes Gross Ignorance of the Law, or a lesser offense.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court *partly granted* the Motion for Reconsideration, reducing the charge from Gross Ignorance of the Law to *Violation of Supreme Court Rules, Directives, and Circulars*.  The penalty was reduced from a P10,000.00 fine to a reprimand.

**Key Provisions & Analysis:**

*   **A.M. No. 11-1-6-SC-PHILJA:**  This "Consolidated and Revised Guidelines to Implement the Expanded Coverage of Court-Annexed Mediation (CAM) and Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR)" mandates referral to CAM/JDR for certain cases, including less grave felonies where the offended party is a private person. This is the central rule at issue. The court notes no exception to the mandatory nature of referral even where parties express disinterest in settling.

*   **Rule 140 of the Rules of Court:** This rule governs administrative sanctions against judges.
    *   **Gross Ignorance of the Law (Section 8):** Requires a showing of bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or similar motive. The Court found insufficient evidence of this.  Cites *Re: Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in the RTC, Branch 4, Dolores, Eastern Samar, 562 Phil. 301, 322 (2007)* to define the requirements for proving Gross Ignorance.
    *   **Violation of Supreme Court Rules, Directives, and Circulars (Section 9):**  A less serious offense.  Sanctions range from suspension to fines.
    *   **Section 11(B):** Deals with the applicable penalties for violations under Rule 140

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   **Judge Dimaguila's Obligation:** Strict compliance with A.M. No. 11-1-6-SC-PHILJA.
*   **Judge Dimaguila's Liability:**  Administratively liable for violating Supreme Court rules, but the penalty was mitigated due to absence of bad faith and a first-time offense.

**Case Law:**

*   **Luna v. Mirafuente, 508 Phil. 1 (2005):** Cited to justify mitigating the penalty. This case also involved a judge violating court rules (Revised Rules on Summary Procedure) and the penalty was mitigated to reprimand due to lack of malice.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjective Interpretation of "Good Motives":** While the court accepted the judge's "good motives" in deviating from the rules, this presents a potential risk of future judges similarly justifying non-compliance based on their subjective beliefs about efficiency or futility.
* **Mandatory nature of Referral:** Despite the judge's belief of the futility of referral, the supreme court stressed the mandatory nature of CAM/JDR as provided by A.M. No. 11-1-6-SC-PHILJA.

**Concise Summary for Lawyer:**

This case clarifies that failure to comply with the mandatory CAM/JDR referral requirements under A.M. No. 11-1-6-SC-PHILJA constitutes a violation of Supreme Court rules.  While subjective "good motives" may mitigate the penalty, the court emphasizes that the mandatory nature of the rule leaves little room for judicial discretion. *Luna v. Mirafuente* establishes precedent for mitigating penalties in similar situations absent malice. However, potential risks remain regarding subjective interpretations of "good motives" as justification for non-compliance in future cases. The decision underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules, even when perceived as inefficient or futile.
