Here's a legal summary of the provided *Filflex Industrial & Manufacturing Corporation vs. NLRC* decision (G.R. No. 115395):

**Case Summary:**

The Supreme Court granted Filflex Industrial & Manufacturing Corporation's petition for certiorari, reversing the NLRC's decision awarding back wages to Salud Galing during the pendency of her appeal. The Court held that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion.

**Key Provisions & Rulings:**

*   **Issue:** Whether an employee is entitled to back wages during the NLRC appeal if the Labor Arbiter's decision didn't order reinstatement, and whether the NLRC can award back wages when the dismissal was deemed legal. The Court answered no to both.
*   **Labor Arbiter Decision:** Initially ruled Galing's dismissal "improper and unjust," awarding limited back wages for six months and separation pay but *not* reinstatement.
*   **NLRC Decision:** Overturned the Labor Arbiter, finding the dismissal *justified* due to Galing's habitual tardiness and absences. However, the NLRC *also* ordered Filflex to pay Galing's salaries from the date of appeal filing until the NLRC's resolution, citing Article 223 of the Labor Code.
*   **Supreme Court Holding:**
    *   Reversed the NLRC's award of back wages.
    *   Art. 223 of the Labor Code (as amended by RA 6715) mandates reinstatement (and therefore back wages) during appeal *only* if the Labor Arbiter specifically ordered reinstatement. Since no reinstatement order was made, there was no basis for the NLRC's award.
    *   The NLRC's decision was inconsistent: finding the dismissal justified but simultaneously awarding back wages as if reinstatement was required.
    *   Finding of Legal Dismissal Bars Reinstatement/Backwages:  Because the NLRC ultimately deemed the dismissal valid, Galing was not entitled to either reinstatement or back wages.  This conclusion is supported by *Lausa vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 187 SCRA 299*.
    *   No Appeal by Galing: Galing did not appeal the NLRC's reversal of the Labor Arbiter's initial award of separation pay, and thus she forfeited any claim to it based on the principle that a non-appealing party cannot receive affirmative relief. *SMI Fish Industries vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 213 SCRA 444*.

**Statutory References:**

*   **Article 223 of the Labor Code (as amended by Section 12 of RA 6715):** Governs appeals to the NLRC and the immediate executory nature of reinstatement orders.
*   **Article 279 of the Labor Code:** Generally regarding reinstatement and backwages for illegally dismissed employees

**Case Law:**

*   **Gold City Integrated Port Service, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 245 SCRA 627:** Regarding reinstatement as a separate and distinct relief.
*   **Torillo vs. Leogardo, 197 SCRA 471:** On requirements for granting backwages.
*   **Indophil Acrylic Mfg. Corp. vs. NLRC, 226 SCRA 723:** On requirements for granting backwages.
*   **Mendoza vs. NLRC, 195 SCRA 606:** Justification for dismissal based on totality of infractions
*   **Lausa vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 187 SCRA 299:** No reinstatement and backwages if dismissal is valid
*   **SMI Fish Industries vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 213 SCRA 444:** No affirmative relief if party did not appeal

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Ambiguity in Labor Arbiter's Decision:**  The NLRC initially interpreted the limited back wages granted by the labor arbiter as implying a reinstatement order, a point argued by private respondent. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected this, emphasizing that reinstatement must be explicitly stated.
*   **Inconsistent Application of Art. 223:** The NLRC misapplied Art. 223 by ordering back wages even though it found the dismissal justified and no reinstatement was ordered.

**Obligations & Liabilities:**

*   Filflex is not liable for back wages to Galing during the appeal period.
*   Galing is not entitled to reinstatement or separation pay.

**Key Takeaway:**

This case clarifies that mandatory reinstatement pending appeal under Article 223 is triggered *only* when the Labor Arbiter's decision specifically orders reinstatement. A finding of legal dismissal by the NLRC negates any basis for reinstatement or back wages.
