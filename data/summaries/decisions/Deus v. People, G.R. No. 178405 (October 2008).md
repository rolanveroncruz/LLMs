**Legal Document Summary: *Reynaldo Deus y Santos v. People of the Philippines***

**Case:** G.R. No. 178405

**Court:** Supreme Court of the Philippines

**Date:** October 15, 2008

**Subject Matter:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs (Violation of Section 5, Article II, R.A. No. 9165) and Appellate Procedure

**Key Provisions and Issues:**

*   **Charge:** Petitioner was charged with and convicted by the RTC for selling 0.01 gram of *shabu* without a license, a violation of R.A. 9165, Section 5, Article II.
*   **Buy-Bust Operation:** The conviction stemmed from a buy-bust operation. Key evidence included the testimony of the poseur-buyer (PO2 Costa) and the forensic chemist's report confirming the substance as *shabu*.
*   **Defense:** Petitioner denied the charges, alleging forced entry into his home by armed men and planting of evidence. His stepdaughter and partner corroborated this.
*   **Trial Court Decision:** The RTC found the petitioner guilty, sentencing him to life imprisonment and a fine of P400,000.00 based on the prosecution's evidence and discrediting the defense's version.
*   **Appellate Court Action:** The Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's petition for *certiorari* because the proper remedy was an ordinary appeal, which was not filed within the prescribed period.
*   **Supreme Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court **granted** the petition. While affirming the general rule that *certiorari* is improper when an appeal is available, the Court held that the Court of Appeals should have treated the petition as an ordinary appeal.
*   **Rationale:** The Court emphasized the circumstances: (1) petitioner filed the petition for *certiorari* pro se; thus, he was unfamiliar with proper legal remedies. (2) his liberty was at stake, thus meriting leniency regarding the rules of procedure, and (3) the CA had already granted extensions, evidencing a willingness to relax the rules.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   **Petitioner:** Convicted of violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 by the RTC.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Chain of Custody:** The decision does not explicitly analyze the chain of custody of the seized drug. This is a common defense in drug cases, and it should be reviewed in the CA during the appeal. **Section 21 of R.A. 9165 requires specific procedures (inventory and photograph in the presence of the accused/representative/counsel, media, DOJ and elected public official) be followed after seizure, and lack of compliance can be fatal to the prosecution's case (see *People v. Ismael*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017).**
*   **Entrapment vs. Instigation:** The facts suggest an entrapment operation, which is legal. However, there's a risk of it being argued as an illegal instigation. The key is whether the criminal intent originated with the accused or was induced by law enforcement.
*   **Credibility of Witnesses:** The trial court based its decision largely on the credibility of witnesses. A careful review of the transcripts is needed to assess if there were any inconsistencies or biases in the prosecution witnesses' testimony.

**Case Law and Statutory References:**

*   **R.A. No. 9165, Section 5, Article II:** Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 65:** Certiorari
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 122, Sections 3 and 6:** Criminal Procedure, Appeals.
*   **Rules of Court, Rule 124, Section 8:** Procedure re abandonment or failure to prosecute in ordinary appeals before the CA.
*    ***Dwikarna v. Domingo, G.R. No. 153454, 7 July 2004:** Outlines when the remedy of Certiorari is proper.**
*   ***People v. Ismael*, G.R. No. 208093, February 20, 2017:** Outlines the requirements for compliance with Section 21, R.A. 9165 regarding chain of custody.

**Next Steps:**

The Court of Appeals will now resolve the petition for *certiorari* as an ordinary appeal. The appeal should focus on (1) chain of custody issues, (2) potential entrapment/instigation arguments, and (3) any significant flaws in the trial court's assessment of witness credibility.
