## Legal Document Summary - *Kenneth R. Mariano vs. Atty. Jose N. Laki*

**Case:** A.C. No. 11978 (Formerly CBD Case No. 10-2769)

**Nature:** Disbarment proceedings initiated by Kenneth R. Mariano (Complainant) against Atty. Jose N. Laki (Respondent) for dishonesty, unprofessional conduct, and violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Contractual Breach:** Atty. Laki accepted P150,000 from Mariano as a "package deal" to file an annulment petition. He failed to file the petition despite repeated follow-ups and receipt of the full amount. This violates the fiduciary duty to handle client matters diligently and promptly.
*   **Accounting & Return of Funds (Canon 16, Rules 16.01, 16.02, 16.03 CPR):** Atty. Laki failed to account for the funds and failed to return the unearned portion after failing to provide the contracted services. This constitutes misappropriation and a breach of trust.
*   **Duty to the Court (Canon 11, Rule 11.04 CPR):** Atty. Laki assured Mariano that he could secure a favorable decision without Mariano's personal appearance since he will file the petition for annulment before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Tarlac which is presided by a "friendly judge" and is known to be receptive to annulment cases, implying undue influence and casting doubt on judicial integrity. This violates the duty to maintain respect for courts and judicial officers.
*   **Compliance with IBP Directives:** Atty. Laki repeatedly failed to file an answer to the complaint, appear at mandatory conferences despite multiple notices, and disregarded IBP orders. This constitutes conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and disrespect for the IBP's disciplinary authority.

**Liabilities:**

*   **Disbarment:** Atty. Laki found guilty of gross misconduct and willful disobedience of lawful orders, leading to his disbarment.
*   **Financial:** Ordered to return P150,000 to Mariano, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the decision, if still unpaid after 90 days.
*   **Professional Restrictions:** Revocation of any existing notarial commission and perpetual disqualification from future commissions as a notary public.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   The decision focuses heavily on Atty. Laki's failure to file an answer and attend hearings, suggesting this procedural default significantly influenced the outcome. The record may be scrutinized for the sufficiency of notice and opportunities given to Atty. Laki to present a defense, although he seems to have actively avoided engaging in the process.
*   Atty. Laki's "friendly judge" statement represents a significant ethical violation.
*   **Statutory References:** The decision heavily relies on the Code of Professional Responsibility. No specific statutes beyond the general legal framework are cited.
*   **Case Law:** The decision cites *Posidio v. Atty. Vitan, 548 Phil. 556, 562 (2007)*, *Foronda v. Atty. Alvarez, Jr., 737 Phil. 1, 10 (2014)*, *Arma v. Atty. Montevilla, 581 Phil. 1, 8 (2008)*, *Cruz v. Justice –Aliño-Hormachuelos, et al., 470 Phil. 435, 445 (2004)*, *Almendarez, Jr. v. Atty. Langit, 528 Phil. 814, 821 (2006)*, *Caspe v. Atty. Mejica, 755 Phil. 312, 321 (2015)*, *Pobre v. Senator Defensor-Santiago, 613 Phil. 352, 365 (2009)*.

**Ambiguities:**

*   None apparent from the document.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court found Atty. Laki guilty of multiple breaches of the CPR, including failing to provide contracted legal services, misappropriating funds, failing to respect the judicial system, and disregarding IBP directives. This resulted in disbarment, financial penalties, and restrictions on future professional activities. The decision emphasized the importance of upholding the integrity of the legal profession and maintaining public trust in the justice system.
