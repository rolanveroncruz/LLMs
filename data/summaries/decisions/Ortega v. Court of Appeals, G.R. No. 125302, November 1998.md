**Case Summary: Ortega v. Court of Appeals, 359 Phil. 126 (1998)**

**Nature:** Petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision dismissing an appeal for lack of *locus standi*. The petitioner, Lorenza Ortega, was the purchaser at an execution sale of property belonging to the respondents, the Tibajias.

**Key Issue:** Whether a purchaser at an execution sale has the right to appeal an order determining the redemption price of the property without having formally intervened in the main action.

**Ruling:** The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, holding that Ortega lacked *locus standi* to appeal.

**Key Provisions & Obligations:**

*   **Execution Sale:** Ortega purchased the Tibajias' property at a public auction following a judgment in favor of Felipe Abel (later substituted by his heirs, and then his assignee Eden Tan) against the Tibajias.
*   **Redemption:** The Tibajias sought to redeem the property, depositing funds with the Clerk of Court.  A dispute arose regarding the correct redemption price, specifically concerning inflated costs included by Abel's assignee, Eden Tan.
*   **Bill of Costs:** The trial court determined that certain costs included in the bill of costs were excessive and reduced the redemption price accordingly.
*   **Intervention (Rule 19, Rules of Court):**  Ortega filed motions related to obtaining title to the property but did not file a formal motion to intervene in the underlying case. The Court emphasized that mere participation in the execution process does not confer party status.

**Liabilities & Potential Risks:**

*   **Lack of Party Status:** Ortega's failure to formally intervene in the case meant she was not a party to the litigation and therefore lacked the standing to appeal the trial court's order regarding the redemption price. This exposes purchasers to vulnerability to unfavourable post-judgement rulings.
*   **Inflated Costs:** The case highlights the risk of inflated costs in execution sales, potentially impacting the redemption price.
*   **Potential for Collusion:** the Court emphasized that even deeply felt right of justice doesn't justify playing loose with the rule.
*   **The court had given chance for the party to justify their appeal, but both Eden Tan and Lorenza Ortega or their counsels did not appear.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Rule 19, Rules of Court (Intervention):**  The core basis for the ruling is the failure to comply with the requirements for intervention.  The Court cites both the old and the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure and specifically Sections 1 and 2 regarding who may intervene and when.
*   **Rule 39, Section 30, Rules of Court:** Pertains to the calculation of the redemption price.
*   **Remedial Law Compendium:** Regalado on Intervention; 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Feria
*   **Pedrosa vs. Hill, 257 SCRA 373, 379:** Procedural rules must be followed except for the most persuasive of reasons.

**Ambiguous or Contentious Clauses:**

*   The extent of the trial court's discretion in allowing or disallowing intervention. The Court acknowledged the trial court's discretion.
*   The degree of participation required to establish *locus standi* without formal intervention. The motions filed by Ortega, while relevant to the execution process, were deemed insufficient.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** This case demonstrates the significant risk that a purchaser at an execution sale faces if they fail to formally intervene in the underlying action.  Without intervention, the purchaser's ability to protect their interests through appeal is severely limited. The ruling underscores the importance of strict adherence to procedural rules, particularly those governing intervention.
