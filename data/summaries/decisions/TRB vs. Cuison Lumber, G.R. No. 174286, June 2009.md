**Legal Document Summary: Traders Royal Bank vs. Cuison Lumber Co., Inc. (G.R. No. 174286, June 05, 2009)**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing a CA decision affirming with modifications an RTC decision in favor of respondents in an action for breach of contract, specific performance, damages, and attorney's fees.

**Key Issue:** Whether a perfected contract of repurchase existed and can be enforced.

**Background:**

*   CLCI obtained loans from TRB secured by real estate mortgage. CLCI defaulted, and TRB extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage, acquiring the property at auction.
*   CLCI, through Mrs. Cuison, attempted to restructure the loan and repurchase the property, proposing terms in a letter dated July 31, 1986.
*   TRB responded on October 20, 1986 (TRB Repurchase Agreement) with a letter laying down different conditions for repurchase, including a repurchase price based on the total bank's claim, a payment schedule, interest rate, and terms for possession and transfer of title. This letter had a "Conforme" section that was unsigned by CLCI.
*   CLCI made payments which TRB considered as "earnest money." CLCI later requested a reduction in the outstanding obligation, which TRB did not grant.
*   TRB subsequently informed CLCI of its intent to resell the property at a higher price, prompting CLCI to file suit.

**RTC Ruling:** Ruled in favor of CLCI, ordering TRB to execute a Contract to Sell reflecting the true consideration, crediting payments as earnest money, and awarding damages and attorney's fees.

**CA Ruling:** Affirmed the RTC's factual findings and legal conclusions but deleted the awards of attorney's fees, moral and exemplary damages, the CA ruled that there was a perfected contract to repurchase the subject property given the bank's acceptance (as stated in the letter dated October 20, 1986) of CLCI's proposal contained in Mrs. Cuison's letter of July 31, 1986.

**Supreme Court Ruling:** GRANTED the petition, reversed the CA decision.

*   **Perfection of Contract:** The SC found that a perfected contract existed based on the bank's counter-offer of October 20, 1986 (TRB Repurchase Agreement), and CLCI's acceptance of the TRB Repurchase Agreement and thus unqualifiedly accepted the bank's counter-offer under the TRB Repurchase Agreement and, in fact, partially executed the agreement. The SC relied on actions like CLCI's payments, request for extensions of time, and possession of the property as evidence of acceptance, despite the lack of a signed "Conforme."
*   **Breach and Cancellation:** The SC held that TRB effectively cancelled the contract when it communicated its intent to sell the property to third parties at a higher price. This, combined with CLCI's failure to comply with the payment schedule, gave TRB the right to cancel under Paragraph 11 of the TRB Repurchase Agreement. The contract to sell nature of the agreement meant full payment was a positive suspensive condition. *Rillo v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125347, June 19, 1997, 274 SCRA 461*.
*   **Rental Payments:**  The SC ordered CLCI to vacate the property and pay reasonable compensation for its use and occupation, including accrued rentals and interest. The Bank's claim for after-acquired rentals, although raised during trial but not in its answer, was permitted under Sec. 5 Rule 10 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as there was implied consent by CLCI to the trial of that issue, and as the claim didn't exist/mature when the answer was filed. *Banco de Oro Universal Bank v. CA, G.R. No. 160354, August 25, 2005, 468 SCRA 166, 185*.
*   **Interest:** Interest on the rentals was imposed at 6% per annum from the date of judicial demand (filing of the counterclaim) until finality, and 12% thereafter until satisfaction. *Eastern Shipping Lines v. CA, G.R. No. 97412, July 12, 1994, 234 SCRA 78*.
*   **Damages/Fees:** No award for exemplary damages, attorney's fees or litigation expenses.

**Key Provisions:**

*   **TRB Repurchase Agreement:** Terms and conditions for the repurchase, including payment schedule, interest, possession, and default clauses (Paragraph 11).
*   **Mrs. Cuison's Letter of July 31, 1986:** CLCI's initial proposal for repurchase.
*   **TRB's Letter of October 20, 1986 (TRB Repurchase Agreement):** TRB's counter-offer, setting out revised terms.

**Obligations:**

*   **CLCI:** Obligation to pay the repurchase price according to the TRB Repurchase Agreement. Obligation to pay reasonable rental for property occupancy.
*   **TRB:** Initially obligated to convey the property upon full payment, but this obligation was extinguished by CLCI's breach and TRB's subsequent cancellation.

**Liabilities:**

*   **CLCI:** Liable for rental payments, interest, and eviction from the property.

**Potential Risks & Contentious Clauses:**

*   **Waiver:** The SC rejected that TRB's previous extensions of time to pay constituted a waiver, as its Statement of Account showed that it considered CLCI to already be in default.
*   **Earnest Money vs. Rental:** The question of whether the payments made by CLCI were earnest money or rental was addressed as the SC found them to be earnest money that should be credited in favor of CLCI against the rentals due from them.
*   **Paragraph 11 (TRB Repurchase Agreement):** Cancellation clause allowing TRB to treat payments as rentals or liquidated damages.

**Statutory References:**

*   Civil Code: Articles 1315, 1319, 1320 (Consent in contracts), Article 1482 (Earnest money), Article 2209 (Damages for delay in payment), Article 2232 (Exemplary damages).
*   Rules of Court: Rule 45 (Petition for Review), Sec. 5 Rule 10 (Amendment to conform to or authorize presentation of evidence).

**Case Law:**

*   *Eastern Shipping Lines v. CA*: Legal interest guidelines.
*   *Rillo v. Court of Appeals*: Contract to sell, suspensive condition.
* *Banco de Oro Universal Bank v. CA*: Amendment to conform to or authorize presentation of evidence

**Ambiguities:**

*   The ambiguity surrounding the intent of the parties given the back-and-forth communication regarding payment schemes was resolved by the Court by looking into their actions.
*   The unsigned "Conforme" was deemed not fatal to the existence of a perfected contract.

**For the Lawyer:**

This case clarifies the requirements for offer and acceptance in a contract, particularly concerning repurchase agreements. The decision emphasizes the importance of conduct in establishing acceptance, even in the absence of a signed document. The case also highlights the right of the vendor to cancel a contract to sell when the vendee fails to comply with payment obligations and the vendor communicates its intent not to proceed. Furthermore, the court clarifies the procedure for raising claims not originally pleaded and the imposition of legal interest. Be aware of the implications of paragraph 11, as it can have significant financial consequences.
