## Legal Document Summary: People vs. Abello, G.R. No. 151952

**Nature:** Appeal of a Court of Appeals (CA) decision affirming a Regional Trial Court (RTC) conviction of Heracleo Abello for rape by sexual assault (Art. 266-A, RPC, as amended by RA 8353) and two counts of acts of lasciviousness (formerly charged as violations of Section 5, Article III of RA 7610).

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Criminal Case No. 19623-MN (Rape by Sexual Assault):** Abello convicted based on victim AAA's testimony that he inserted his penis into her mouth while she was asleep.
    *   **Elements Met:** Court determined all elements met based on AAA's testimony.
    *   **Variance in Information & Proof:** Information alleged "force and intimidation," while evidence showed victim was asleep. Court, citing *People v. Corpuz*, held that failure to object to evidence of different mode of commission waived the variance.
*   **Criminal Case Nos. 19624-MN and 19625-MN (Acts of Lasciviousness):** Abello initially convicted under RA 7610 for fondling AAA's breasts. CA affirmed conviction but were modified to acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC as amended.
    *   **RA 7610 Inapplicability:** Court found that the victim did not fall under the definition of "child" under RA 7610 as the prosecution failed to provide medical evidence showing that the victim's disability rendered her incapable of fully taking care of herself or of protecting herself against sexual abuse. This doubt was resolved in favour of the accused.
    *   **Elements Met (Art. 336, RPC):** Court determined the allegations in the Informations sufficiently constitute acts punishable under Article 336 of the RPC. First and second elements met through AAA's testimony, third element of her being asleep while the act was committed also proven. Court again addressed a variance in the mode of commission, invoking *Corpuz*.
*   **Defense Arguments Rejected:**
    *   Relationship with mother: The Court found that the familial relation did not grant the offender immunity from the crimes. It stated that the relationship between the offender and the offended party is not an obstacle to the commission of the crime.
    *   Victim could have dreamed: This argument was deemed preposterous by the Court. The Court emphasized that it is unlikely that the victim will expose herself to the risks of trial if she was uncertain of the facts.
*   **Penalty:**
    *   Rape by Sexual Assault: Indeterminate sentence of 6 years *prision correccional* to 10 years *prision mayor*.
    *   Acts of Lasciviousness: Indeterminate sentence of 6 months *arresto mayor* to 4 years and 2 months *prision correccional* for each count.
*   **Civil Liability:**
    *   Rape: P30,000 civil indemnity, P30,000 moral damages, P25,000 exemplary damages.
    *   Acts of Lasciviousness (per count): P20,000 civil indemnity, P30,000 moral damages, P2,000 exemplary damages.
    *   Exemplary Damages: Awarded due to aggravating circumstance of dwelling and knowledge of the physical disability of the victim, even though these were not alleged in the Informations.

**Obligations:**

*   **Abello:** Serve sentences, pay civil liabilities.
*   **State:** Enforce judgment.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguous Clauses:**

*   **Variance in Information:** The repeated reliance on *People v. Corpuz* to overcome variances between allegations and proof highlights a potential weakness. While the Court found the failure to object waived the issue, this could be grounds for further appeal focusing on due process and adequate notice of the charges.
*   **Aggravating Circumstance of Relationship:** Although initially alleged, the relationship was not proven.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Art. 15 (Alternative Circumstances), Art. 71 (Scale of Penalties), Art. 266-A (Rape), Art. 266-B (Qualified Rape), Art. 336 (Acts of Lasciviousness)
*   **Republic Act No. 7610 (Child Abuse Law):** Section 5 (Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse), Section 3(a) (Definition of Child).
*   **Republic Act No. 8353 (New Rape Law):** Amendments to rape provisions.
*   **Indeterminate Sentence Law**
*   **Civil Code:** Art. 2230 (Exemplary Damages)
*   **People v. Corpuz:** Doctrine of waiver for failure to object to variance between allegation and proof.
*   **Olivarez v. Court of Appeals:** Interpretation of "other sexual abuse" and determining the nature of crime.

**Conclusion:**

The conviction was largely upheld, albeit modified. Potential grounds for appeal exist around the procedural aspects of the variances between the information and evidence presented, specifically focusing on the alleged lack of force. However, this argument would likely be met with the established jurisprudence cited by the Court.
