## Legal Document Summary: ABS-CBN v. Ombudsman (G.R. No. 133347)

**Document Type:** Supreme Court Decision (Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65)

**Core Issue:** Whether the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing ABS-CBN's criminal complaint against Roberto Benedicto, et al., for alleged crimes related to the seizure and occupation of ABS-CBN's facilities during martial law.

**Key Provisions & Facts:**

*   **Martial Law Sequestration:** ABS-CBN's facilities were seized and closed under LOI No. 1 issued by President Marcos.
*   **June 8, 1973 Letter-Agreement:** KBS/RPN (controlled by Benedicto) entered into a lease agreement with ABS-CBN to use the latter's broadcast studios. ABS-CBN alleges this was entered into under duress due to the political climate and detention of Eugenio Lopez, Jr.
*   **Lack of Rental Payments:** KBS/RPN occupied the ABS-CBN facilities without paying the stipulated rentals.
*   **Transfer to Government Entities:** ABS-CBN stations were eventually transferred to the National Media Production Center (NMPC) and Bureau of Broadcast.
*   **Criminal Charges Filed:** ABS-CBN filed a complaint-affidavit with the Ombudsman alleging various crimes under the RPC (Execution of Deeds by Violence/Intimidation, Estafa, Theft, Robbery, Usurpation of Real Rights, Other Deceits).
*   **Ombudsman's Dismissal:** The Ombudsman dismissed the complaint, finding no probable cause to indict the respondents.
*   **Death of Benedicto & Tan:** Both Benedicto and Tan died during the pendency of the case.

**Key Obligations/Liabilities:**

*   **Letter-Agreement (Civil Obligations):** The primary legal basis for the relationship between ABS-CBN and KBS/RPN is the June 8, 1973 Letter-Agreement. This creates contractual obligations regarding rental payments and responsibility for leased facilities.
*   **Criminal Liability (RPC):** The crux of ABS-CBN's argument is that the actions of Benedicto and the other respondents constituted criminal offenses under the Revised Penal Code (RPC). The Ombudsman, however, found no probable cause for criminal charges.
*   **Potential Liability of Estates:** While the criminal liability and civil liability *ex delicto* of Benedicto and Tan were extinguished by death (citing *People v. Bayotas*), the decision indicates a separate civil action based on the June 8 1973 letter agreement was filed against the estate of Roberto S. Benedicto per Rule 86, Sec. 5 of the Rules of Court.

**Potential Risks & Ambiguities:**

*   **Duress/Vitiated Consent:** ABS-CBN's argument that the Letter-Agreement was entered into under duress is weakened by their subsequent actions, including pursuing rental negotiations, demanding payment of rentals, and making claims against Benedicto's estate based on the same agreement. The SC held that ratification cures this defect
*   **Statute of Limitations:** While this does not appear to be a central issue in the document, the substantial period between the events and the filing of the complaint could have raised potential statute of limitations concerns.
*   **Immunity:** The grant of "absolute immunity" to Benedicto as part of the Compromise Agreement in Sandiganbayan Civil Case No. 34 is a significant factor impacting potential criminal liability.
*   **Proof of Criminal Intent:** The document suggests difficulty in proving the *mens rea* (criminal intent) required for the alleged RPC violations. The Ombudsman found the allegations more indicative of a civil dispute.

**Relevant Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Revised Penal Code (RPC):** Articles 298, 315, 308, 302, 312, 318 (basis for criminal charges)
*   **Rules of Court:** Rule 65 (Certiorari), Rule 111 (Institution of Civil Action), Rule 86 (Claims Against Estate)
*   **Civil Code:** Article 1157 (Sources of Obligations), Article 1390(2), 1391, 1392, 1393 and 1396 (Contracts that are voidable and ratification)
*   **People v. Bayotas (G.R. No. 102007):** Extinguishment of criminal liability upon death; survival of civil liability based on other sources of obligation.
*   **Torrijos v. Court of Appeals (G.R. No. L-40336):** Civil liability survives death.
*   **Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) v. Desierto:** Ombudsman powers and prosecutorial discretion.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court affirmed the Ombudsman's dismissal of ABS-CBN's criminal complaint, finding no grave abuse of discretion. The Court focused on the validity and ratification of the June 8, 1973 Letter-Agreement, which rendered the actions civil in nature. The deaths of Benedicto and Tan extinguished criminal liability *ex delicto*. While separate civil action based on the letter agreement was filed against the estate of Roberto S. Benedicto.
