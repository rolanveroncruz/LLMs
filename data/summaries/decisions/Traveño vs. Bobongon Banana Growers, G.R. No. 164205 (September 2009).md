## Legal Document Summary: *Trave√±o v. Bobongon Banana Growers Multi-Purpose Cooperative, et al.* (G.R. No. 164205, September 3, 2009)

**Summary:**

This Supreme Court decision concerns a claim for illegal dismissal and money claims brought by petitioners (banana plantation workers) against Bobongon Banana Growers Multi-Purpose Cooperative (Cooperative), Timog Agricultural Corporation (TACOR), Diamond Farms, Inc. (DFI), and Dole Asia Philippines (DAP). The Court upheld the NLRC's finding that the Cooperative was the employer of the petitioners and dismissed the claims against TACOR, DFI, and DAP, finding no employer-employee relationship between them and the workers.

**Key Provisions & Findings:**

*   **Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court applied the four-fold test (selection/engagement, payment of wages, power of dismissal, and control) and determined that the Cooperative was the sole employer. The control test, especially the control over the *means* and *methods* of work, was crucial.
*   **Joint Venture, not Job Contracting:** The agreement between DFI and the Cooperative was characterized as a joint venture/business partnership (Banana Production and Purchase Agreement), not a job contracting arrangement, rendering labor-only contracting rules inapplicable.
*   **Autonomy of Contracts (Article 1306, Civil Code):** The Court respected the freedom of contract between DFI and the Cooperative unless contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy.
*   **Defective Certification Against Forum Shopping:** The Court acknowledged the appellate court's error in dismissing the entire petition due to some petitioners failing to sign the verification and certification against forum shopping, citing *Altres v. Empleo* (G.R. No. 180986, December 10, 2008). However, rather than remanding, it decided the case on its merits.
*   **Dole Asia Philippines / Dole Philippines, Inc.:** The Court found that Dole Philippines, Inc. (DPI) was the intended respondent, despite its claim that the service was for "Dole Asia Philippines," a non-existent entity. Despite this finding, the court did not hold DPI liable, adhering to the original arbiter and NLRC findings that there was no direct employer-employee relationship.
*   **Dissolved Cooperative:** The Court noted the Cooperative's dissolution, leaving petitioners with limited recourse.
*   **Social Justice:** The Court recognized the importance of labor laws and the Constitution's social justice policy but emphasized that it should not be oppressive of capital.

**Obligations:**

*   The Cooperative, now dissolved, was primarily obligated to pay the backwages, unpaid wages, wage differentials, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay as awarded by the NLRC. However, there are no direct obligations for the respondents (DPI, TACOR, and DFI).

**Liabilities:**

*   Based on the court's decision, there is no existing legal basis for liability on the part of DFI (as successor to TACOR) and DPI concerning the petitioner's claims of illegal dismissal.

**Potential Risks:**

*   **Dissolved Cooperative:** Petitioners face the risk of being unable to collect on the judgment against the Cooperative due to its dissolution. The court suggested pursuing remedies against former members of the defunct Cooperative, depending on individual circumstances, but this presents practical challenges.

**Case Law & Statutory References:**

*   **Article 1306, Civil Code:** Autonomy of contracts.
*   **Labor Code and Implementing Rules:** Framework for labor relations and illegal dismissal.
*   **Altres v. Empleo (G.R. No. 180986, December 10, 2008):** Jurisprudence on verification and certification against forum shopping.
*   **De los Santos v. National Labor Relations Commission, 423 Phil. 1020, 1029 (2001):** Case on defining the four-fold test to determine employer-employee relationship.
*   **Joint Venture:** Kilosbayan v. Guingona, G.R. No. 113375, May 5, 1994, 232 SCRA 110, 144.

**Ambiguous/Contentious Clauses:**

*   The characterization of the relationship between DFI and the Cooperative as a "joint venture" rather than a disguised employer-employee relationship or labor-only contracting arrangement is contentious, particularly given the workers' claims of control and supervision. This is a fact-specific determination, and the Court placed weight on the formal agreement between the companies.
