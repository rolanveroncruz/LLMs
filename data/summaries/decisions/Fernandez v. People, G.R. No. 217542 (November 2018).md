**Case Summary: *Fernandez v. People*, G.R. No. 217542, November 21, 2018**

**Nature:** Petition for Review on Certiorari assailing the Court of Appeals' affirmation of the Regional Trial Court's conviction of Christine Fernandez for two counts of violation of Section 10(a) of Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act).

**Key Provisions:**

*   **R.A. 7610, Sec. 3(b):** Defines "child abuse" as maltreatment, habitual or not, including psychological and physical abuse, neglect, cruelty, sexual abuse, emotional maltreatment; any act that debases, degrades, or demeans a child; unreasonable deprivation of basic needs; or failure to provide immediate medical treatment to an injured child.
*   **R.A. 7610, Sec. 10(a):** Penalizes any person who commits other acts of child abuse, cruelty, or exploitation, or is responsible for other conditions prejudicial to the child's development, with *prision mayor* in its minimum period.
*   **Implementing Rules and Regulations, Sec. 2:** Further defines Child Abuse, Cruelty, and Physical Injury.

**Facts:** Fernandez, the stepmother of AAA and BBB, was convicted of physically abusing them. The victims testified to various acts of violence, including pinching, hitting, scalding, and using pliers and other objects to inflict pain. Their testimonies were corroborated by medical certificates, photographs of injuries, and the testimony of a teacher who noticed the abuse.

**Court Ruling:** The Supreme Court denied the petition and affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision, finding Fernandez guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The Court emphasized the trial court's superior position to assess witness credibility and found no compelling reason to overturn its findings. Minor inconsistencies in the child witnesses' testimonies were deemed badges of truthfulness, especially in recounting traumatic experiences. The Court also upheld the mandate to protect the welfare of children under R.A. 7610. The SC imposed a 6% annual interest rate on all damages awarded from the date of finality of the Decision until fully paid.

**Obligations and Liabilities:**

*   Fernandez is obligated to serve a prison sentence ranging from four (4) years, nine (9) months, and eleven (11) days of *prision correccional* to a maximum of six (6) years, eight (8) months, and one (1) day of *prision mayor* for each count of violation.
*   Fernandez is liable to pay AAA and BBB civil indemnity of P30,000 each, with a 6% annual interest rate from the date of finality of the Supreme Court Decision.

**Potential Risks and Ambiguities:**

*   **Subjectivity of "Cruelty":** The definition of "cruelty" in the Implementing Rules hinges on "reasonableness" and "moderation" in discipline, potentially leading to subjective interpretations.
*   **Inconsistency Argument:** While the Court dismissed the inconsistency argument regarding the testimonies of AAA and BBB, future cases with more significant discrepancies might lead to different outcomes.
*   **Application of "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" Standard:**  The defense argued a failure to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; this highlights the importance of corroborating evidence in child abuse cases.

**Relevant Case Law:**

*   **People v. De Los Santos:** Affirmed the principle that trial courts are best positioned to assess witness credibility.
*   **Sanchez v. People:** Upheld conviction for child abuse based on witness testimonies and underscored the respect accorded to trial court findings.
*   **Araneta v. People:** Emphasized R.A. 7610's role in protecting children and providing a strong deterrent against child abuse.

**Statutory References:**

*   Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act)
*   Presidential Decree No. 603 (Child and Youth Welfare Code) (mentioned in Sec. 10(a) of R.A. 7610)
*   Revised Penal Code (mentioned in Sec. 10(a) of R.A. 7610)

**Conclusion:** This case reinforces the strict application of R.A. 7610 in cases of child abuse. The Supreme Court deferred to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility and upheld the conviction based on consistent testimonies and corroborating evidence. The case highlights the importance of protecting children and the serious consequences of child abuse.
